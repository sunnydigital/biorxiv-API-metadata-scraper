    "abstract": "Local adaptation is often studied via 1) multiple common garden experiments comparing performance of genotypes in different environments and 2) sequencing genotypes from multiple locations and characterizing geographic patterns in allele frequency. Both approaches aim to characterize the same pattern (local adaptation), yet the complementary information from each has not yet been coherently integrated. Here, we develop a genome-wide association model of genotype interactions with continuous environmental gradients (GxE), i.e. reaction norms. We present an approach to impute relative fitness, allowing us to coherently synthesize evidence from common garden and genome-environment associations. Our approach identifies loci exhibiting environmental clines where alleles are associated with higher fitness in home environments. Simulations show our approach can increase power to detect loci causing local adaptation. In a case study on Arabidopsis thaliana, most identified SNPs exhibited home allele advantage and fitness tradeoffs along climate gradients, suggesting selective gradients can maintain allelic clines. SNPs exhibiting GxE associations with fitness were enriched in genic regions, putative partial selective sweeps, and associations with an adaptive phenotype (flowering time plasticity). We discuss extensions for situations where only adaptive phenotypes other than fitness are available. Many types of data may point toward the loci underlying GxE and local adaptation; coherent models of diverse data provide a principled basis for synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Animal and plant richness in tropical rainforests has long intrigued naturalist. More recent work has revealed that parasites contribute to high tropical tree diversity (Bagchi et al., 2014; Terborgh, 2012) and that arthropods are the most diverse eukaryotes in these forests (Erwin, 1982; Basset et al., 2012). It is unknown if similar patterns are reflected at the microbial scale with unicellular eukaryotes or protists. Here we show, using environmental metabarcoding and a novel phylogeny-aware cleaning step, that protists inhabiting Neotropical rainforest soils are hyperdiverse and dominated by the parasitic Apicomplexa, which infect arthropods and other animals. These host-specific protist parasites potentially contribute to the high animal diversity in the forests by reducing population growth in a density-dependent manner. By contrast, we found too few Oomycota to broadly drive high tropical tree diversity in a host-specific manner under the Janzen-Connell model (Janzen, 1970; Connell, 1970). Extremely high OTU diversity and high heterogeneity between samples within the same forests suggest that protists, not arthropods, are the most diverse eukaryotes in tropical rainforests. Our data show that microbes play a large role in tropical terrestrial ecosystems long viewed as being dominated by macro-organisms.\\n\\nContact: dunthorn@rhrk.uni-kl.de",

    "abstract": "Dissecting the physiological circuitry underlying diverse human complex traits associated with heritable common mutations is an ongoing effort. The primary challenge involves identifying the relevant cell types and the causal variants among the vast majority of the associated mutations in the noncoding regions. To address this challenge, we developed an efficient probabilistic framework. First, we propose a sparse group-guided learning algorithm to infer cell-type-specific enrichments. Second, we propose a fine-mapping Bayesian model that incorporates as Bayesian priors the sparse enrichments to infer risk variants. Using the proposed framework to analyze 32 complex human traits revealed meaningful tissue-specific epigenomic enrichments indicative of the relevant disease pathologies. The prioritized variants exhibit prominent tissue-specific epigenomic signatures and significant enrichments for eQTL and conserved elements. Together, we demonstrate the general benefits of the proposed integrative framework in elucidating meaningful tissue-specific epigenomic elements from large-scale correlated annotations and the implicated functional variants for future experimental interrogation.",

In the special case of deep brain stimulation (DBS), the three most common targets are the subthalamic nucleus (STN), the internal part of the pallidum (GPi) and the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus (VIM). With the help of atlases that define the position and shape of these target regions within a well-defined stereotactic space, their spatial relationship to implanted deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes may be determined.\\n\\nHere we present a composite atlas based on manual segmentations of a multi-modal high-resolution MNI template series, histology and structural connectivity. To attain exact congruence to the template anatomy, key structures were defined using all four modalities of the template simultaneously. In a first step tissue probability maps were defined based on the multimodal intensity profile of each structure. These observer-independent probability maps provided an excellent basis for the subsequent manual segmentation particularly when defining the outline of the target regions.\\n\\nSecond, the key structures were used as an anchor point to coregister a histology based atlas into standard space. Finally, a sub-segmentation of the subthalamic nucleus into three functional zones was estimated based on structural connectivity. The resulting composite atlas uses the spatial information of the MNI template for DBS key structures that are visible on the template itself. For remaining structures, it relies on histology or structural connectivity. In this way the final atlas combines the anatomical detail of a histology based atlas with the spatial accuracy of key structures in relationship to the template anatomy. Thus, the atlas provides an ideal tool for the analysis of DBS electrode placement.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIComposite subcortical atlas based on a multimodal, high definition MNI template series, histology and tractography\\nC_LIO_LIHigh definition atlas of DBS targets exactly matching MNI 152 NLIN 2009b space\\nC_LIO_LIMultimodal subcortical segmentation algorithm applied to MNI template\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "SummaryThe central task of a genome browser is to enable easy visual exploration of large genomic data to gain biological insight. Most existing genome browsers were designed for data exploration by individual users, while a few allow some limited forms of collaboration among multiple users, such as file sharing and wiki-style collaborative editing of gene annotations. Our works premise is that allowing sharing of genome browser views instantaneously in real-time enables the exchange of ideas and insight in a collaborative project, thus harnessing the wisdom of the crowd. PBrowse is a parallel-access real-time collaborative web-based genome browser that provides both an integrated, real-time collaborative platform and a comprehensive file sharing system. PBrowse also allows real-time track comment and has integrated group chat to facilitate interactive discussion among multiple users. Through the Distributed Annotation Server protocol, PBrowse can easily access a wide range of publicly available genomic data, such as the ENCODE data sets. We argue that PBrowse, with the re-designed user management, data management and novel collaborative layer based on Biodalliance, represents a paradigm shift from seeing genome browser merely as a tool of data visualisation to a tool that enables real-time human-human interaction and knowledge exchange in a collaborative setting.\\n\\nAvailabilityPBrowse is available at http://pbrowse.victorchang.edu.au, and its source code is available via the open source BSD 3 license at http://github.com/VCCRI/PBrowse.\\n\\nContactj.ho@victorchang.edu.au\\n\\nSupplementary InformationSupplementary video demonstrating collaborative feature of pbrowse is available in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROvKXZoXiIc.",

    "abstract": "In noisy, dynamic environments, organisms must distinguish genuine change (e.g., the movement of prey) from noise (e.g., the rustling of leaves). Expectations should be updated only when the organism believes genuine change has occurred. Although individual variables can be highly unreliable, organisms can take advantage of the fact that changes tend to be correlated (e.g., movement of prey will tend to produce changes in both visual and olfactory modalities). Thus, observing a change in one variable provides information about the rate of change for other variables. We call this the penumbra of learning. At the neural level, the penumbra of learning may offer an explanation for why strong plasticity in one synapse can rescue weak plasticity at another (synaptic tagging and capture). At the behavioral level, it has been observed that weak learning of one task can be rescued by novelty exposure before or after the learning task. Here, using a simple number prediction task, we provide direct behavioral support for the penumbra of learning in humans, and show that it can be accounted for by a normative computational theory of learning.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the evolution of dispersal is an important issue in evolutionary ecology. For continuous time models in which individuals disperse throughout their lifetime, it has been shown that a balanced dispersal strategy, which results in an ideal free distribution, is evolutionary stable in spatially varying but temporally constant environments. Many species, however, primarily disperse prior to reproduction (natal dispersal) and less commonly between reproductive events (breeding dispersal). These species include territorial species such as birds and reef fish, and sessile species such as plants, and mollusks. As demographic and dispersal terms combine in a multiplicative way for models of natal dispersal, rather than the additive way for the previously studied models, we develop new mathematical methods to study the evolution of natal dispersal for continuous-time and discrete-time models. A fundamental ecological dichotomy is identified for the non-trivial equilibrium of these models: (i) the per-capita growth rates for individuals in all patches are equal to zero, or (ii) individuals in some patches experience negative per-capita growth rates, while individuals in other patches experience positive per-capita growth rates. The first possibility corresponds to an ideal-free distribution, while the second possibility corresponds to a \\\"source-sink\\\" spatial structure. We prove that populations with a dispersal strategy leading to an ideal-free distribution displace populations with dispersal strategy leading to a source-sink spatial structure. When there are patches which can not sustain a population, ideal-free strategies can be achieved by sedentary populations, and we show that these populations can displace populations with any irreducible dispersal strategy. Collectively, these results support that evolution selects for natal or breeding dispersal strategies which lead to ideal-free distributions in spatially heterogenous, but temporally homogenous, environments.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic stimulation (TMS) of human occipital and posterior parietal cortex can give rise to visual sensations called phosphenes, but neural correlates of phosphene perception preceding and succeeding stimulation of both areas are unknown. Using near-threshold TMS with concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, we uncover oscillatory brain dynamics that covary, on single trials, with the perception of phosphenes following occipital and parietal TMS. Prestimulus power and phase predominantly in the alpha-band (8-13 Hz) predicted occipital TMS phosphenes, whereas higher frequency beta-band (13-20 Hz) power (but not phase) predicted parietal TMS phosphenes. TMS evoked responses related to phosphene perception were similar across stimulation sites and were characterized by an early (200 ms) posterior negativity and a later (>300 ms) parietal positivity in the time domain and an increase in low-frequency (~5-7 Hz) power followed by a broadband decrease in alpha/beta power in the time-frequency domain. These correlates of phosphene perception closely resemble known electrophysiological correlates of conscious perception using near-threshold visual stimuli and speak to the possible early onset of visual consciousness. The differential pattern of prestimulus predictors of phosphene perception suggest that distinct frequencies reflect cortical excitability within different cortical regions, and that the alpha-band rhythm, long thought of as a general index of cortical inhibition, may not reflect excitability of posterior parietal cortex.\\n\\nSignificance statementAlpha-band oscillations are thought to reflect cortical excitability and are therefor suggested to play an important role in gating information transmission across cortex. We directly probe cortical excitability in human occipital and parietal cortex and observed that whereas alpha-band dynamics indeed reflect excitability of occipital areas, beta-band activity was most predictive of parietal cortex excitability. Differences in the state of cortical excitability predicted perceptual outcomes, which were manifest in both early and late patterns of evoked activity, shedding light on the neural correlates of consciousness. Our findings prompt revision of the notion that alpha activity reflects inhibition across all of cortex and suggests instead that excitability in different regions is reflected in distinct frequency bands.",

We found that constitutive immune activity in intestinal progenitors disrupts expression of homeostatic regulators such as Notch signal transduction pathway components and induces hyperplasia throughout the gut. Consistent with these observations, we found that persistent immune signaling interferes with progenitor cell differentiation and exacerbates the formation of Notch-dependent intestinal tumors.

    "abstract": "Cooperative transcription factor binding at cis-regulatory sites in the genome drives robust eukaryotic gene expression, and many such sites must be coordinated to produce coherent transcriptional programs. The transcriptional program leading to motile cilia formation requires members of the DNA-binding forkhead (Fox) and Rfx transcription factor families and these factors co-localize to cilia gene promoters, but it is not clear how many cilia genes are regulated by these two factors, whether these factors act directly or indirectly, or how these factors act with specificity in the context of a 3-dimensional genome. Here, we use genome-wide approaches to show that cilia genes reside at the boundaries of topological domains and that these areas have low enhancer density. We show that the transcription factors Foxj1 and Rfx2 binding occurs in the promoters of more cilia genes than other known cilia transcription factors and that while Rfx2 binds directly to promoters and enhancers equally, Foxj1 prefers direct binding to enhancers and is stabilized at promoters by Rfx2. Finally, we show that Rfx2 and Foxj1 lie at the anchor endpoints of chromatin loops, suggesting that target genes are activated when Foxj1 bound at distal sites is recruited via a loop created by Rfx2 binding at both sites. We speculate that the primary function of Rfx2 is to stabilize distal enhancers with proximal promoters by operating as a scaffolding factor, bringing key regulatory domains bound by Foxj1 into close physical proximity and enabling coordinated cilia gene expression.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe multiciliated cell extends hundreds of motile cilia to produce fluid flow in the airways and other organ systems. The formation of this specialized cell type requires the coordinated expression of hundreds of genes in order to produce all the protein parts motile cilia require. While a relatively small number of transcription factors has been identified that promote gene expression during multiciliate cell differentiation, it is not clear how they work together to coordinate the expression of genes required for multiple motile ciliation. Here, we show that two transcription factors known to drive cilia formation, Foxj1 and Rfx2, play complementary roles wherein Foxj1 activates target genes but tends not to bind near them in the genome, whereas Rfx2 cant activate target genes by itself but instead acts as a scaffold by localizing Foxj1 to the proper targets. These results suggest not only a mechanism by which complex gene expression is coordinated in multiciliated cells, but also how transcriptional programs in general could be modular and deployed across different cellular contexts with the same basic promoter configuration.",

    "abstract": "Global warming is exposing plants to more frequent heat stress, with consequent crop yield reduction. Organisms exposed to large temperature increases protect themselves typically with a heat shock response (HSR). To study the HSR in photosynthetic organisms we present here a data driven mathematical model describing the dynamics of the HSR in the model organism Chlamydomonas reinhartii. Temperature variations are sensed by the accumulation of unfolded proteins, which activates the synthesis of heat shock proteins (HSP) mediated by the heat shock transcription factor HSF1. Our dynamical model employs a system of ordinary differential equations mostly based on mass-action kinetics to study the time evolution of the involved species. The signalling network is inferred from data in the literature, and the multiple experimental data-sets available are used to calibrate the model, which allows to reproduce their qualitative behaviour. With this model we show the ability of the system to adapt to temperatures higher than usual during heat shocks longer than three hours by shifting to a new steady state. We study how the steady state concentrations depend on the temperature at which the steady state is reached. We systematically investigate how the accumulation of HSPs depends on the combination of temperature and duration of the heat shock. We finally investigate the system response to a smooth variation in temperature simulating a hot day.",

    "abstract": "Brain dynamics span multiple spatial and temporal scales, from fast spiking neurons to slow fluctuations over distributed areas. No single experimental method links data across scales. Here, we bridge this gap using The Virtual Brain connectome-based modelling platform to integrate multimodal data with biophysical models and support neurophysiological inference. Simulated cell populations were linked with subject-specific white-matter connectivity estimates and driven by electroencephalography-derived electric source activity. The models were fit to subject-specific resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data, and overfitting was excluded using 5-fold cross-validation. Further evaluation of the models show how balancing excitation with feedback inhibition generates an inverse relationship between -rhythms and population firing on a faster time scale and resting-state network oscillations on a slower time scale. Lastly, large-scale interactions in the model lead to the emergence of scale-free power-law spectra. Our novel findings underscore the integrative role for computational modelling to complement empirical studies.",

    "abstract": "The stability of mRNA is one of the major determinants of gene expression. Although a wealth of sequence elements regulating mRNA stability has been described, their quantitative contributions to half-life are unknown. Here, we built a quantitative model for Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on functional mRNA sequence features that explains 60% of the half-life variation between genes and predicts half-life at a median relative error of 30%. The model revealed a new destabilizing 3UTR motif, ATATTC, which we functionally validated. Codon usage proves to be the major determinant of mRNA stability. Nonetheless, single-nucleotide variations have the largest effect when occurring on 3UTR motifs or upstream AUGs. Analyzing mRNA half-life data of 34 knockout strains showed that the effect of codon usage not only requires functional decapping and deadenylation, but also the 5-to-3 exonuclease Xrn1, the non-sense mediated decay genes, but not no-go decay. Altogether, this study quantitatively delineates the contributions of mRNA sequence features on stability in yeast, reveals their functional dependencies on degradation pathways, and allows accurate prediction of half-life from mRNA sequence.",

    "abstract": "Antibody libraries are important resources to derive antibodies to be used for a wide range of applications, from structural and functional studies to intracellular protein interference studies to developing new diagnostics and therapeutics. Whatever the goal, the key parameter for an antibody library is its diversity, i.e. the number of distinct elements in the collection, which directly reflects the probability of finding in the library an antibody against a given antigen, of sufficiently high affinity. Quantitative evaluation of antibody library diversity and quality has been for a long time inadequately addressed, due to the high similarity and length of the sequences of the library. Diversity was usually inferred by the transformation efficiency and tested either by fingerprinting and/or sequencing of a few hundred random library elements. Inferring diversity from such a small sample is, however, very rudimental and gives limited information about the real complexity, because complexity does not scale linearly with sample size. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has opened new ways to tackle the antibody library diversity quality assessment. However, much remains to be done to fully exploit the potential of NGS for the quantitative analysis of antibody repertoires and to overcome current limitations. To obtain a more reliable antibody library complexity estimate here we show a new, PCR-free, NGS approach to sequence antibody libraries on Illumina platform, coupled to a new bioinformatic analysis and software (Diversity Estimator of Antibody Library, DEAL) that allows to reliably estimate the diversity, taking in consideration the sequencing error.",

A small number of suitable traits, phenotypic plasticity, gene flow and hybridization made it difficult to establish the taxonomy and phylogeny of the whole genus despite various studies using molecular markers. We inferred the phylogeny of the Amaranthus genus using genotyping by sequencing (GBS) of 94 genebank accessions representing 35 Amaranthus species and measured their genome sizes. SNPs were called by de novo and reference-based methods, for which we used the distant sugarbeet Beta vulgaris and the closely related Amaranthus hypochondriacus as references. SNP counts and proportions of missing data differed between methods, but the resulting phylogenetic trees were highly similar. A distance-based neighbor joing tree of individual accessions and a species tree calculated with the multispecies coalescent supported a previous taxonomic classification into three subgenera although the subgenus A. Acnida consists of two highly differentiated clades. The analysis of the Hybridus complex within the A. Amaranthus subgenus revealed insights on the history of cultivated grain amaranths. The complex includes the three cultivated grain amaranths and their wild relatives and was well separated from other species in the subgenus. Wild and cultivated amaranth accessions did not differentiate according to the species assignment but clustered by their geographic origin from South and Central America. Different geographically separated populations of Amaranthus hybridus appear to be the common ancestors of the three cultivated grain species and A. quitensis might be additionally be involved in the evolution of South American grain amaranth (A. caudatus). We also measured genome sizes of the species and observed little variation with the exception of two lineages that showed evidence for a recent polyploidization. With the exception of two lineages, genome sizes are quite similar and indicate that polyploidization did not play a major role in the history of the genus.",

While recent studies have demonstrated the utility of high-resolution SNP-based genetic markers for identifying population-specific migratory patterns, the accuracy of this approach relative to other intrinsic tagging techniques has not yet been assessed.\\nC_LIO_LIHere, using a straightforward application of Bayes' Rule, we develop a method for combining inferences from high-resolution genetic markers, stable isotopes, and habitat suitability models, to spatially infer the breeding origin of migrants captured anywhere along their migratory pathway. Using leave-one-out cross validation, we compare the accuracy of this combined approach with the accuracy attained using each source of data independently.\\nC_LIO_LIOur results indicate that when each method is considered in isolation, the accuracy of genetic assignments far exceeded that of assignments based on stable isotopes or habitat suitability models. However, our joint assignment method consistently resulted in small, but informative increases in accuracy and did help to correct misassignments based on genetic data alone. We demonstrate the utility of the combined method by identifying previously undetectable patterns in the timing of migration in a North American migratory songbird, the Wilson's warbler.\\nC_LIO_LIOverall, our results support the idea that while genetic data provides the most accurate method for tracking animals using intrinsic markers when each method is considered independently, there is value in combining all three methods.

    "abstract": "Geographic isolation that drives speciation is often assumed to slowly increase over time, for instance through the formation of rivers, the formation of mountains or the movement of tectonic plates. Cyclic changes in connectivity between areas may occur with the advancement and retraction of glaciers, with water level fluctuations in seas between islands or in lakes that have an uneven bathymetry. These habitat dynamics may act as a driver of allopatric speciation and propel local diversity. Here we present a parsimonious model of the interaction between cyclical (but not necessarily periodic) changes in the environment and speciation, and provide an ABC-SMC method to infer the rates of allopatric and sympatric speciation from a phylogenetic tree. We apply our approach to the posterior sample of an updated phylogeny of the Lamprologini, a tribe of cichlid fish from Lake Tanganyika where such cyclic changes in water level have occurred. We find that water level changes play a crucial role in driving diversity in Lake Tanganyika. We note that if we apply our analysis to the Most Credible Consensus (MCC) tree, we do not find evidence for water level changes influencing diversity in the Lamprologini, suggesting that the MCC tree is a misleading representation of the true species tree. Furthermore, we note that the signature of habitat dynamics is found in the posterior sample despite the fact that this sample was constructed using a species tree prior that ignores habitat dynamics. However, in other cases this species tree prior might erase this signature. Hence we argue that in order to improve inference of the effect of habitat dynamics on biodiversity, phylogenetic reconstruction methods should include tree priors that explicitly take into account such dynamics.",

From this expanded cellular mass, another cell gains a new mutation allowing this newly mutated cell to gain new competitive advantage and to expand in number (thus clonal expansion). Another clone then emerges. Eventually all required mutations are gained, and a cancer forms. Consequently, while a primary lesion may harbor divergent subclones, all the subclones within the primary cancer as well as all metastatic growths in secondary organs share at least the very first oncogenic mutation that initiates the primary cancer. However, by tracking genetically marked mammary epithelial cells that suffered the initiating oncogenic mutation--and their neighboring mammary cells that did not-in several mouse models of human breast cancer, we found that genetically unrelated mammary epithelial cells can be colluded by neighboring mutated cells to disseminate, and that they can even undergo de novo tumorigenic transformation and form distant metastases. Therefore, clonally unrelated epithelial cells may contribute to cancer progression and to the heterogeneity of the systemic disease.

However, the use of multiple passages of viral isolates to obtain sufficient material for international standards may result in genomic changes that complicate their use as quantitative standards. We performed next-generation sequencing to gain single-nucleotide resolution and relative copy number of JC virus (JCV) clinical standards. Strikingly, the WHO international standard and ExactTM v1/v2 prototype standards for JCV showed 8-fold and 4-fold variation in genomic coverage between different loci in the viral genome, respectively, due to large deletions in the large T-antigen region. No such variation was seen for a clinical sample with high copy-number of JCV nor a plasmid control. Intriguingly, several of the JCV standards sequenced in this study with large T-antigen deletions were cultured in cell lines immortalized using SV40 T-antigen, suggesting the possibility of trans-complementation in cell culture. Using a cut-off of 2% variant allele fraction for junctional reads to define the presence of a strain, 11 different strains were present in the WHO standard. In summary, targeting of different regions of the same international standard could result in up to an 8-fold difference in quantitation.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe availability of dense genotypes and whole-genome sequence variants from various sources offers the opportunity to compile large data sets consisting of tens of thousands of animals with genotypes for millions of polymorphic sites that may enhance the power of genomic analyses. The imputation of missing genotypes ensures that all individuals have genotypes for a shared set of variants.\\n\\nResultsWe evaluated the accuracy of imputation from dense genotypes to whole-genome sequence variants in 249 Fleckvieh and 450 Holstein cattle using Minimac and FImpute. The sequence variants of a subset of the animals were reduced to the variants that were included in the Illumina BovineHD genotyping array and subsequently inferred in silico using either within- or multi-breed reference populations. The accuracy of imputation varied considerably across chromosomes and dropped at regions where the bovine genome contains segmental duplications. Depending on the imputation strategy, the correlation between imputed and true genotypes ranged from 0.898 to 0.952. The accuracy of imputation was higher with Minimac than FImpute particularly for rare alleles. Considering a multi-breed reference population increased the accuracy of imputation, particularly when FImpute was used to infer genotypes. When the sequence variants were imputed using Minimac, the true genotypes were more correlated to predicted allele dosages than best-guess genotypes. The computing costs to impute 23,256,743 sequence variants in 6958 animals were 10-fold higher with Minimac than FImpute. Association studies with imputed sequence variants revealed seven quantitative trait loci (QTL) for milk fat percentage. Two known causal mutations in the DGAT1 and GHR genes were the most significantly associated variants at two QTL on chromosomes 14 and 20 when Minimac was used to infer genotypes.\\n\\nConclusionsThe population-based imputation of millions of sequence variants in large cohorts provides accurate genotypes and is computationally feasible. Using a reference population that includes individuals from many breeds increases the accuracy of imputation particularly at low-frequency variants. Considering allele dosages rather than best-guess genotypes as explanatory variables is advantageous for association studies with imputed sequence variants.",

    "abstract": "Identifying an object and distinguishing it from similar items depends upon the ability to perceive its component parts as conjoined into a cohesive whole, but the brain mechanisms underlying this ability remain elusive. The ventral visual processing pathway in primates is organized hierarchically: Neuronal responses in its early stages are sensitive to the manipulation of simple visual features whereas neuronal responses in subsequent stages are tuned to increasingly complex stimulus attributes. It is widely assumed that feature-coding dominates in early visual cortex whereas later visual regions employ conjunction-coding in which object representations are different from the sum of their simple-feature parts. However, no study has demonstrated that putative object-level codes in higher visual cortex cannot be accounted for by feature-coding and that putative feature-codes in regions prior to ventral temporal cortex are not equally well characterized as object-level codes. Thus the existence of a transition from feature- to conjunction-coding in visual cortex remains unconfirmed, and, if a transition does occur, its location remains unknown. By employing multivariate analysis of human functional imaging data, we measure both feature-coding and conjunction-coding directly, using the same set of visual stimuli, and pit them against each other to reveal the relative dominance of one versus the other throughout cortex. We provide the first demonstration of a transition from feature-coding in early visual cortex to conjunction-coding in both inferior temporal and posterior parietal cortices. This novel method enables the use of experimentally controlled stimulus features to investigate population-level feature- and conjunction-codes throughout human cortex.",

    "abstract": "The hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis is a key biological system required for reproduction and associated sexual behaviors to occur. Each of these tissues, the hypothalamus in the brain, the pituitary gland, and the gonads (testes and ovaries), has specialized and sometimes sex-specific functions that promote, amongst other things, reproductive processes. To fully characterize the transcript community of each aspect of the HPG axis, as well as to uncover potentially important sex-specific differences, we characterized patterns of gene expression in sexually mature male and female rock dove (Columba livia) hypothalamus, pituitary, and gonads. We describe patterns of gene expression amongst tissues as well as patterns of sex-biased gene expression which may underlie some of the fundamental differences between male and female reproductive behavior. We report greater sex-biased differential expression in the pituitary (233 genes out of 15,102 genes) as compared to the hypothalamus (1 gene out of 15,102 genes), with multiple genes overexpressed in the male pituitary gland being related to locomotion, and multiple genes over-expressed in the female pituitary gland being related to reproduction, growth and development. These genes may be associated with facilitating the different roles the HPG system plays in sex-specific reproductive behavior, including life-history strategies characterized by short-term payoffs in males (i.e. locomotion) and longer-term payoffs in females (i.e. development and reproduction). In addition, we report novel patterns of sex-biased expression in genes involved in reproduction-associated processes. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone, Progesterone, and Androgen receptor were upregulated in the female pituitary as compared to the male pituitary. We also found greater expression of Prolactin in the female pituitary as compared to the male pituitary, but it was more highly expressed in the male hypothalamus as compared to the female hypothalamus. The Prolactin receptor was also more highly expressed in the male hypothalamus and pituitary gland as compared to corresponding female tissues. Finally, we discovered greater expression of Arginine Vasopressin Receptor 1A in the male pituitary as compared to the female pituitary. Using a more global analysis, we discovered other interesting sex-biased patterns in genes not originally targeted for investigation. These genes include like Betacellulin (BTC), which was upregulated in the female pituitary and compared to males, and Ecto-NOX Disulfide-Thiol Exchanger 1 (ENOX1), which was upregulated in the male pituitary as compared to females. These genes may play important, though currently unknown, roles in reproductive physiology and behavior. In conclusion, we reveal patterns of tissue specific and sexually dimorphic gene expression in the HPG axis, highlighting the need for sex parity in transcriptomic studies and providing new lines of investigation of the mechanisms of reproductive function.",

    "abstract": "Research in oncology traditionally focuses on specific tissue type from which the cancer develops. However, advances in high-throughput molecular profiling technologies have enabled the comprehensive characterization of molecular aberrations in multiple cancer types. It was hoped that these large-scale datasets would provide the foundation for a paradigm shift in oncology which would see tumors being classified by their molecular profiles rather than tissue types, but tumors with similar genomic aberrations may respond differently to targeted therapies depending on their tissue of origin. There is therefore a need to reassess the potential association between pharmacological response and tissue of origin for therapeutic drugs, and to test how these associations translate from preclinical to clinical settings.\\n\\nIn this paper, we investigate the tissue specificity of drug sensitivities in large-scale pharmacological studies and compare these associations to those found in clinical trial descriptions. Our meta-analysis of the four largest in vitro drug screening datasets indicates that tissue of origin is strongly associated with drug response. We identify novel tissue-drug associations, which may present exciting new avenues for drug repurposing. One caveat is that the vast majority of the significant associations found in preclinical settings do not concur with clinical observations. Accordingly, our results call for more testing to find the root cause of the discrepancies between preclinical and clinical observations.",

    "abstract": "Larvae of the insect Galleria mellonella are increasingly being used for studying pathogenic microbes and their virulence mechanisms, and as a rapid model for screening novel antimicrobial agents. The larvae (waxworms) are most frequently infected by injection of pathogenic organisms into the haemocoel through the insects prolegs. The mostly widely used method for restraining the waxworms for injection is by grasping them between the operators fingers, which puts the operator at risk of needle stick injury, an important consideration when working with highly pathogenic and/or drug-resistant microorganisms. While use of a stab proof glove can reduce this risk of injury, it does so at the loss of manual dexterity and speed, resulting in a more labour-intensive and cumbersome assay. We describe a simple cost effective device (the so-called  Galleria Grabber) for restraining waxworms for injection that keeps the operators fingers clear of the needle thus reducing the risk of injury.",

    "abstract": "To characterize the left-ventral occipito-temporal cortex (lvOT) role during reading in a quantitatively explicit and testable manner, we propose the lexical categorization model (LCM). The LCM assumes that lvOT optimizes linguistic processing by allowing fast meaning access when words are familiar and filter out orthographic strings without meaning. The LCM successfully simulates benchmark results from functional brain imaging. Empirically, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we demonstrate that quantitative LCM simulations predict lvOT activation across three studies better than alternative models. Besides, we found that word-likeness, which is assumed as input to LCM, is represented posterior to lvOT. In contrast, a dichotomous word/non-word contrast, which is assumed as the LCMs output, could be localized to upstream frontal brain regions. Finally, we found that training lexical categorization results in more efficient reading. Thus, we propose a ventral-visual-stream processing framework for reading involving word-likeness extraction followed by lexical categorization, before meaning extraction.",

    "abstract": "Duplication of information in databases is a major data quality challenge. The presence of duplicates, implying either redundancy or inconsistency, can have a range of impacts on the quality of analyses that use the data. To provide a sound basis for research on this issue in databases of nucleotide sequences, we have developed new, large-scale validated collections of duplicates, which can be used to test the effectiveness of duplicate detection methods. Previous collections were either designed primarily to test efficiency, or contained only a limited number of duplicates of limited kinds. To date, duplicate detection methods have been evaluated on separate, inconsistent benchmarks, leading to results that cannot be compared and, due to limitations of the benchmarks, of questionable generality.\\n\\nIn this study we present three nucleotide sequence database benchmarks, based on information drawn from a range of resources, including information derived from mapping to Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL. Each benchmark has distinct characteristics. We quantify these characteristics and argue for their complementary value in evaluation. The benchmarks collectively contain a vast number of validated biological duplicates; the largest has nearly half a billion duplicate pairs (although this is probably only a tiny fraction of the total that is present). They are also the first benchmarks targeting the primary nucleotide databases. The records include the 21 most heavily studied organisms in molecular biology research. Our quantitative analysis shows that duplicates in the different benchmarks, and in different organisms, have different characteristics. It is thus unreliable to evaluate duplicate detection methods against any single benchmark. For example, the benchmark derived from Swiss-Prot mappings identifies more diverse types of duplicates, showing the importance of expert curation, but is limited to coding sequences. Overall, these benchmarks form a resource that we believe will be of great value for development and evaluation of the duplicate detection methods that are required to help maintain these essential resources.\\n\\nAvailability: The benchmark data sets are available at https://bitbucket.org/biodbqual/benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRNAs play key roles in cells through the interactions with proteins known as the RNA-binding proteins (RBP) and their binding motifs enable crucial understanding of the post-transcriptional regulation of RNAs. How the RBPs correctly recognize the target RNAs and why they bind specific positions is still far from clear. Machine learning-based algorithms are widely acknowledged to be capable of speeding up this process. Although many automatic tools have been developed to predict the RNA-protein binding sites from the rapidly growing multi-resource data, e.g. sequence, structure, their domain specific features and formats have posed significant computational challenges. One of current difficulties is that the cross-source shared common knowledge is at a higher abstraction level beyond the observed data, resulting in a low efficiency of direct integration of observed data across domains. The other difficulty is how to interpret the prediction results. Existing approaches tend to terminate after outputting the potential discrete binding sites on the sequences, but how to assemble them into the meaningful binding motifs is a topic worth of further investigation.\\n\\nResultsIn viewing of these challenges, we propose a deep learning-based framework (iDeep) by using a novel hybrid convolutional neural network and deep belief network to predict the RBP interaction sites and motifs on RNAs. This new protocol is featured by transforming the original observed data into a high-level abstraction feature space using multiple layers of learning blocks, where the shared representations across different domains are integrated. To validate our iDeep method, we performed experiments on 31 large-scale CLIP-seq datasets, and our results show that by integrating multiple sources of data, the average AUC can be improved by 8% compared to the best single-source-based predictor; and through cross-domain knowledge integration at an abstraction level, it outperforms the state-of-the-art predictors by 6%. Besides the overall enhanced prediction performance, the convolutional neural network module embedded in iDeep is also able to automatically capture the interpretable binding motifs for RBPs. Large-scale experiments demonstrate that these mined binding motifs agree well with the experimentally verified results, suggesting iDeep is a promising approach in the real-world applications.\\n\\nConclusionThe iDeep framework not only can achieve promising performance than the state-of-the-art predictors, but also easily capture interpretable binding motifs. iDeep is available at http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/iDeep",

    "abstract": "Between-sample normalization is a critical step in genomic data analysis to remove systematic bias and unwanted technical variation in high-throughput data. Global normalization methods are based on the assumption that observed variability in global properties is due to technical reasons and are unrelated to the biology of interest. For example, some methods correct for differences in sequencing read counts by scaling features to have similar median values across samples, but these fail to reduce other forms of unwanted technical variation. Methods such as quantile normalization transform the statistical distributions across samples to be the same and assume global differences in the distribution are induced by only technical variation. However, it remains unclear how to proceed with normalization if these assumptions are violated, for example if there are global differences in the statistical distributions between biological conditions or groups, and external information, such as negative or control features, is not available. Here we introduce a generalization of quantile normalization, referred to as smooth quantile normalization (qsmooth), which is based on the assumption that the statistical distribution of each sample should be the same (or have the same distributional shape) within biological groups or conditions, but allowing that they may differ between groups. We illustrate the advantages of our method on several high-throughput datasets with global differences in distributions corresponding to different biological conditions. We also perform a Monte Carlo simulation study to illustrate the bias-variance tradeoff of qsmooth compared to other global normalization methods.

    "abstract": "Through genome-wide association studies (GWASs), researchers have identified hundreds of genetic variants associated with particular complex traits. Previous studies have compared the pattern of association signals across different populations in real data, and these have detected differences in the strength and sometimes even the direction of GWAS signals. These differences could be due to a combination of (1) lack of power (insufficient sample sizes); (2) minor allele frequency (MAF) differences (again affecting power); (3) linkage disequilibrium (LD) differences (affecting power to  tag the causal variant); and (4) true differences in causal variant effect sizes (defined by relative risks).\\n\\nIn the present work, we sought to assess whether the first three of these reasons are sufficient on their own to explain the observed incidence of trans-ethnic differences in replications of GWAS signals, or whether the fourth reason is also required. We simulated case-control data of European, Asian and African ancestry, drawing on observed MAF and LD patterns seen in the 1000-Genomes reference dataset and assuming the true causal relative risks were the same in all three populations.\\n\\nWe found that a combination of Euro-centric SNP selection and between-population differences in LD, accentuated by the lower SNP density typical of older GWAS panels, was sufficient to explain the rate of trans-ethnic differences previously reported, without the need to assume between-population differences in true causal SNP effect size. This suggests a cross-population consistency that has implications for our understanding of the interplay between genetics and environment in the aetiology of complex human diseases.",

More visual detail can be stored in VSTM when complex, recognisable objects are maintained compared to simple objects. It is not yet known if it is recognisability that enhances memory precision, nor whether maintenance of recognisable objects is achieved with the same network of brain regions supporting maintenance of simple objects.\\n\\nWe used a novel stimulus generation method to parametrically warp photographic images along a continuum, allowing separate estimation of the precision of memory representations and the number of items retained. The stimulus generation method was also designed to create unrecognisable, though perceptually matched, stimuli, to investigate the impact of recognisability on VSTM. We adapted the widely-used change detection and continuous report paradigms for use with complex, photographic images.\\n\\nAcross three functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments, we demonstrated greater precision for recognisable objects in VSTM compared to unrecognisable objects. This clear behavioural advantage was not the result of recruitment of additional brain regions, or of stronger mean activity within the core network. Representational similarity analysis revealed greater variability across item repetitions in the representations of recognisable, compared to unrecognisable complex objects. We therefore propose that a richer range of neural representations support VSTM for complex recognisable objects.",

    "abstract": "GenBank, the EMBL European Nucleotide Archive, and the DNA DataBank of Japan, known collectively as the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration or INSDC, are the three most significant nucleotide sequence databases. Their records are derived from laboratory work undertaken by different individuals, by different teams, with a range of technologies and assumptions, and over a period of decades. As a consequence, they contain a great many duplicates, redundancies, and inconsistencies, but neither the prevalence nor the characteristics of various types of duplicates have been rigorously assessed. Existing duplicate detection methods in bioinformatics only address specific duplicate types, with inconsistent assumptions; and the impact of duplicates in bioinformatics databases has not been carefully assessed, making it difficult to judge the value of such methods. Our goal is to assess the scale, kinds, and impact of duplicates in bioinformatics databases, through a retrospective analysis of merged groups in INSDC databases. Our outcomes are threefold: (1) We analyse a benchmark dataset consisting of duplicates manually identified in INSDC - a dataset of 67,888 merged groups with 111,823 duplicate pairs across 21 organisms from INSDC databases - in terms of the prevalence, types, and impacts of duplicates. (2) We categorise duplicates at both sequence and annotation level, with supporting quantitative statistics, showing that different organisms have different prevalence of distinct kinds of duplicate. (3) We show that the presence of duplicates has practical impact via a simple case study on duplicates, in terms of GC content and melting temperature. We demonstrate that duplicates not only introduce redundancy, but can lead to inconsistent results for certain tasks. Our findings lead to a better understanding of the problem of duplication in biological databases.",

    "abstract": "One of the most important roles of cells is performing their cellular tasks properly for survival. Cells usually achieve robust functionality, for example cell-fate decision-making and signal transduction, through multiple layers of regulation involving many genes. Despite the combinatorial complexity of gene regulation, its quantitative behavior has been typically studied on the basis of experimentally-verified core gene regulatory circuitry, composed of a small set of important elements. It is still unclear how such a core circuit operates in the presence of many other regulatory molecules and in a crowded and noisy cellular environment. Here we report a new computational method, named random circuit perturbation (RACIPE), for interrogating the robust dynamical behavior of a gene regulatory circuit even without accurate measurements of circuit kinetic parameters. RACIPE generates an ensemble of random kinetic models corresponding to a fixed circuit topology, and utilizes statistical tools to identify generic properties of the circuit. By applying RACIPE to simple toggle-switch-like motifs, we observed that the stable states of all models converge to experimentally observed gene state clusters even when the parameters are strongly perturbed. RACIPE was further applied to a proposed 22-gene network of the Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal transition (EMT), from which we identified four experimentally observed gene states, including the states that are associated with two different types of hybrid Epithelial/Mesenchymal phenotypes. Our results suggest that dynamics of a gene circuit is mainly determined by its topology, not by detailed circuit parameters. Our work provides a theoretical foundation for circuit-based systems biology modeling. We anticipate RACIPE to be a powerful tool to predict and decode circuit design principles in an unbiased manner, and to quantitatively evaluate the robustness and heterogeneity of gene expression.",

    "abstract": "In early 2016, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) proposed that responsible sharing of de-identified individual-level data be required for clinical trials published in their affiliated journals. There would be a delay in implementing this policy to allow for the necessary informed consents to work their way through ethical review. Meanwhile, some researchers and policy makers have conflated the notions of de-identification and anonymity. The former is a process that seeks to mitigate disclosure risk though careful application of rules and statistical analysis, while the latter is an absolute state. The consequence of confusing the process and the state is profound. Extensions to the ICMJE proposal based on the presumed anonymity of data include: sharing unconsented data; sharing data without managing access, as Open Data; and proposals to sell data. This essay aims to show that anonymity (the state) cannot be guaranteed by de-identification (the process), and so these extensions to the ICMJE proposal should be rejected on governance grounds, if no other. This is not as negative a position as it might seem, as other disciplines have been aware of these limitations and concomitant responsibilities for many years. The essay concludes with an example from social science of managed access strategies that could be adopted by the medical field.",

We can exploit this common ancestry at the level of sequences, but also in terms of observable outcomes (phenotypes), to learn more about health and disease for humans and all other species. Applying the range of available knowledge to solve challenging disease problems requires unified data relating genomics, phenotypes, and disease; it also requires computational tools that leverage these multimodal data to inform interpretations by geneticists and to suggest experiments. However, the distribution and heterogeneity of databases is a major impediment: databases tend to focus either on a single data type across species, or on single species across data types. Although each database provides rich, high-quality information, no single one provides unified data that is comprehensive across species, biological scales, and data types. Without a big-picture view of the data, many questions in genetics are difficult or impossible to answer. The Monarch Initiative (https://monarchinitiative.org) is an international consortium dedicated to providing computational tools that leverage a computational representation of phenotypic data for genotype-phenotype analysis, genomic diagnostics, and precision medicine on the basis of a large-scale platform of multimodal data that is deeply integrated across species and covering broad areas of disease.",
