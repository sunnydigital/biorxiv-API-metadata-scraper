    "abstract": "Secondary bacterial infections increase morbidity and mortality of influenza A virus (IAV) infections. Bacteria are able to invade due to virus-induced depletion of alveolar macrophages (AMs), but this is not the only contributing factor. By analyzing a kinetic model, we uncovered a nonlinear initial dose threshold that is dependent on the amount of virus-induced AM depletion. The threshold separates the growth and clearance phenotypes such that bacteria decline for dose-AM depletion combinations below the threshold, stay constant near the threshold, and increase above the threshold. In addition, the distance from the threshold correlates to the growth rate. Because AM depletion changes throughout an IAV infection, the dose requirement for bacterial invasion also changes accordingly. Using the threshold, we found that the dose requirement drops dramatically during the first 7d of IAV infection. We then validated these analytical predictions by infecting mice with doses below or above the predicted threshold over the course of IAV infection. These results identify the nonlinear way in which two independent factors work together to support successful post-influenza bacterial invasion. They provide insight into coinfection timing, the heterogeneity in outcome, the probability of acquiring a coinfection, and the use of new therapeutic strategies to combat viral-bacterial coinfections.",

    "abstract": "The timing of events in the life history of temperate insects is most typically primarily cued by one of two drivers: photoperiod or temperature accumulation over the growing season. However, an insects phenology can also be moderated by other drivers like rainfall or the phenology of its host plants. When multiple drivers of phenology interact, there is greater potential for phenological asynchronies to arise between an organism and those with which it interacts. We examined the phenological patterns of a highly seasonal group of fireflies (Photinus spp, predominantly P. pyralis) over a 12-year period (2004-2015) across 10 plant communities to determine if interacting drivers could explain the variability observed in the adult flight activity density (i.e. mating season) of this species. We found that temperature accumulation was the primary driver of phenology, with activity peaks usually occurring at a temperature accumulation of ~800 degree days (base 10{degrees}C), however, our model found this peak varied by nearly 180 degree day units among years. This variation could be explained by a quadratic relationship with the accumulation of precipitation in the growing season; in years with either high and low precipitation extremes at our study site, flight activity was delayed. More fireflies were captured in general in herbaceous plant communities with minimal soil disturbance (alfalfa and no-till field crop rotations), but only weak interactions occurred between within-season responses to climatic variables and plant community. The interaction we observed between temperature and precipitation accumulation suggests that, although climate warming has potential to disrupt phenology of many organisms, changes to regional precipitation patterns can magnify these disruptions.",

We performed ChlP-seq for two histone modifications and RNA-seq to profile cis-regulatory element (CRE) activity and gene expression. The primate regulatory landscape is largely conserved across the lineage. Conserved CRE function is associated with sequence conservation, proximity to coding genes, cell type specificity of CRE function, and transcription factor binding. Newly evolved CREs are enriched in immune response and neurodevelopmental functions, while conserved CREs bind master regulators. Transposable elements (TEs) are the primary source of novelty in primate gene regulation. Newly evolved CREs are enriched in young TEs that affect gene expression. However, only 17% of conserved CREs overlap a TE, suggesting that target gene expression is under strong selection. Finally, we identified specific genomic features driving the functional recruitment of newly inserted TEs.",

Structure can arise and be maintained via social preferences or be indirectly shaped by habitat structure. Understanding how social structure emerges is important for understanding the potential links between social structure and evolutionary and ecological processes. Here, we study a large community of wild birds fitted with uniquely-coded passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags and recorded on a grid of automated feeders fitted with radio frequency identification (RFID) antennae. We show that both large-scale and fine-scale network communities are consistent across years in this population, despite high generational turn-over. Studying the process that generates community structure, here the movement of individual birds across the woodland, suggests an important role of habitat geometry in shaping population-level social community structure. Our study highlights how relatively simple factors can produce apparent emergent social structure at the population scale, which has widespread implications for understanding eco-evolutionary dynamics.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, several large-scale whole-genome projects sequencing tens of thousands of individuals were completed, with larger studies are underway. These projects aim to provide high-quality genotypes for a large number of whole genomes in a cost-efficient manner, by sequencing each genome at low coverage and subsequently identifying alleles jointly in the entire cohort. Here we present Ref-Reveel, a novel method for large-scale population genotyping. We show that Ref-Reveel provides genotyping at a higher accuracy and higher efficiency in comparison to existing methods by applying our method to one of the largest whole-genome sequencing datasets presently available to the public. We further show that utilizing the resulting genotype panel as references, through the Ref-Reveel framework, greatly improves the ability to call genotypes accurately on newly sequenced genomes. In addition, we present a Ref-Reveel pipeline that is applicable for genotyping of very small datasets. In summary, Ref-Reveel is an accurate, scalable and applicable method for a wide range of genotyping scenarios, and will greatly improves the quality of calling genomic alterations in current and future large-scale sequencing projects.",

    "abstract": "There is an urgent need for reliable effective therapy for patients with metastatic sarcoma. Approaches that manipulate the immune system have shown promise for patients with advanced, widely disseminated malignancies. One of these approaches is adoptive cell therapy (ACT), where tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) are isolated from the tumor, expanded ex vivo, and then transferred back to the patient. This approach has shown great promise in melanoma, leading to an objective response in approximately half of treated patients [14]. Standard protocols involve characterization of TIL populations with respect to adaptive CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes, but neglect the possible role of the innate lymphoid repertoire. Due to toxicity and the high cost associated with ACT, the IFN-{gamma} release assay is currently used as a proxy to identify suitable TIL isolates for ACT. Efforts in TIL-ACT for sarcoma, which are pre-clinical and pioneered at Moffitt Cancer Center, have shown that only a minority of the TIL cultures show tumor specific activity in ex vivo IFN-{gamma} assays. Surprisingly, internal melanoma trial data reveal a lack of correlation between IFN-{gamma} assay and clinical outcomes, highlighting the need for a more reliable proxy. We hypothesize the existence of a predictable TIL meta-phenotype that leads to optimal tumor response. Here, we describe preliminary efforts to integrate prospective and existing patient data with mathematical models to optimize the TIL meta-phenotype prior to re-injection.",

    "abstract": "Chitin-binding LysM effectors contribute to virulence of various plant pathogenic fungi that are causal agents of foliar diseases. Here, we report on LysM effectors of the soil-borne fungal vascular wilt pathogen Verticillium dahliae. Comparative genomics revealed three core LysM effectors that are conserved in a collection of V. dahliae strains. Remarkably, and in contrast to the previously studied LysM effectors of other plant pathogens, no expression of core LysM effectors was monitored in planta in a taxonomically diverse panel of host plants. Moreover, targeted deletion of the individual LysM effector genes in V. dahliae strain JR2 did not compromise virulence in infections on Arabidopsis, tomato or Nicotiana benthamiana. Interestingly, an additional lineage-specific LysM effector is encoded in the genome of V. dahliae strain VdLs17 but not in any other V. dahliae strain sequenced to date. Remarkably, this lineage-specific effector is expressed in planta and contributes to virulence of V. dahliae strain VdLs17 on tomato, but not on Arabidopsis or on N. benthamiana. Functional analysis revealed that this LysM effector binds chitin, is able to suppress chitin-induced immune responses, and protects fungal hyphae against hydrolysis by plant hydrolytic enzymes. Thus, in contrast to the core LysM effectors of V. dahliae, this lineage-specific LysM effector of strain VdLs17 contributes to virulence in planta.",

While these developments are tremendous from the perspective of maximizing the scientific utility of available data, they come with heavy costs. The storage and transmission of such vast amounts of sequencing data is expensive.\\n\\nResultsWe present Quark, a semi-reference-based compression tool designed for RNA-seq data. Quark makes use of a reference sequence when encoding reads, but produces a representation that can be decoded independently, without the need for a reference. This allows Quark to achieve markedly better compression rates than existing reference-free schemes, while still relieving the burden of assuming a specific, shared reference sequence between the encoder and decoder. We demonstrate that Quark achieves state-of-the-art compression rates, and that, typically, only a small fraction of the reference sequence must be encoded along with the reads to allow reference-free decompression.\\n\\nAvailabilityQuark is implemented in C++11, and is available under a GPLv3 license at www.github.com/COMBINE-lab/quark.\\n\\nContactrob.patro@cs.stonybrook.edu",

    "abstract": "Infection by Campylobacter is recognised as the most common cause of foodborne bacterial illness worldwide. Faecal contamination of meat, especially chicken, during processing represents a key route of transmission to humans. There is currently no licenced vaccine and no Campylobacter-resistant chickens. In addition, preventative measures aimed at reducing environmental contamination and exposure of chickens to Campylobacter jejuni (biosecurity) have been ineffective. There is much interest in the factors/mechanisms that drive C. jejuni colonisation and infection of animals, and survival in the environment. It is anticipated that understanding these mechanisms will guide the development of effective intervention strategies to reduce the burden of C. jejuni infection. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of C. jejuni fitness during growth and survival within and outside hosts. A comparative analysis of transposon (Tn) gene inactivation libraries in three C. jejuni strains by Tn-seq demonstrated that a large proportion, 331 genes, of the C. jejuni genome is dedicated to (in vitro) growth. An extensive Tn library in C. jejuni M1cam (~10,000 mutants) was screened for the colonisation of commercial broiler chickens, survival in houseflies and under nutrient-rich and-poor conditions at low temperature, and infection of human gut epithelial cells. We report C. jejuni factors essential throughout its life cycle and we have identified genes that fulfil important roles across multiple conditions, including maf3, fliW, fliD, pflB and capM, as well as novel genes uniquely implicated in survival outside hosts. Taking a comprehensive screening approach has confirmed previous studies, that the flagella are central to the ability of C. jejuni to interact with its hosts. Future efforts should focus on how to exploit this knowledge to effectively control infections caused by C. jejuni.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCampylobacter jejuni is the leading bacterial cause of human diarrhoeal disease. C. jejuni encounters and has to overcome a wide range of \\\"stress\\\" conditions whilst passing through the gastrointestinal tract of humans and other animals, during processing of food products, on/in food and in the environment. We have taken a comprehensive approach to understand the basis of C. jejuni growth and within/outside host survival, with the aim to inform future development of intervention strategies. Using a genome-wide transposon gene inactivation approach we identified genes core to the growth of C. jejuni. We also determined genes that were required during the colonisation of chickens, survival in the housefly and under nutrient-rich and -poor conditions at low temperature, and during interaction with human gut epithelial tissue culture cells. This study provides a comprehensive dataset linking C. jejuni genes to growth and survival in models relevant to its life cycle. Genes important across multiple models were identified as well as genes only required under specific conditions. We identified that a large proportion of the C. jejuni genome is dedicated to growth and that the flagella fulfil a prominent role in the interaction with hosts. Our data will aid development of effective control strategies.",

    "abstract": "Recurring epidemics of kiwifruit (Actinidia spp.) bleeding canker disease are caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa), whose emergence coincided with domestication of its host. The most recent pandemic has had a deleterious effect on kiwifruit production worldwide. In order to strengthen understanding of population structure, phylogeography and evolutionary dynamics of Psa, we sampled 746 Pseudomonas isolates from cultivated and wild kiwifruit across six provinces in China, of which 87 were Psa. Of 234 Pseudomonas isolated from wild Actinidia spp. none were identified as Psa. Genome sequencing of fifty isolates and the inclusion of an additional thirty from previous studies show that China is the origin of the recently emerged pandemic lineage. However China harbours only a fraction of global Psa diversity, with greatest diversity found in Korea and Japan. Distinct transmission events were responsible for introduction of the pandemic lineage of Psa into New Zealand, Chile and Europe. Two independent transmission events occurred between China and Korea, and two Japanese isolates from 2014 cluster with New Zealand Psa. Despite high similarity at the level of the core genome and negligible impact of within-lineage recombination, there has been substantial gene gain and loss even within the single clade from which the global pandemic arose.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTBleeding canker disease of kiwifruit caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa) has come to prominence in the last three decades. Emergence has coincided with domestication of the host plant and provides a rare opportunity to understand ecological and genetic factors affecting the evolutionary origins of Psa. Here, based on genomic analysis of an extensive set of strains sampled from China and augmented by isolates from a global sample, we show, contrary to earlier predictions, that China is not the native home of the pathogen, but is nonetheless the source of the recent global pandemic. Our data identify specific transmission events, substantial genetic diversity and point to non-agricultural plants in either Japan or Korea as home to the source population.",

Studies attempting to quantify allostatic load have used a variety of clinical biomarkers representing primary and secondary mediators. In this study, we demonstrate the value of including red blood cell distribution width (RDW) among the panel of clinical parameters used to calculate allostatic load.\\n\\nMethodsWe develop a novel formulation of allostatic load using RDW and other standard biomarkers. This index is computed using clinical laboratory data from the NHANES study. The predictive validity of the new index for tertiary outcomes (all-cause mortality and physician-assessed health status) is compared to that of the current formulation using Harrells C index, ROC analysis and regression-based goodness-of-fit measures.\\n\\nResultsInclusion of RDW as an allostatic load biomarker yields a significantly improved index. It demonstrates a superior ability to predict mortality, health status and biological age than the standard formulation currently in use.\\n\\nConclusionRDW has shown strong correlations with mortality and a broad spectrum of diseases. A review of the existing literature on allostatic load reveals its underutilization in this area, despite being a standard component of blood count panels.

To address this limitation we initiated the Intensive Trial of OMics in Cancer (ITOMIC)-001, in which patients with metastatic TNBC undergo multiple biopsies over space and time5. Whole exome sequencing (WES) of 67 samples from 11 patients identified 426 genes containing multiple distinct single nucleotide variants (SNVs) within the same sample, instances we term Multiple SNVs affecting the Same Gene and Sample (MSSGS). We find that >90% of MSSGS result from cis-compound mutations (in which both SNVs affect the same allele), that MSSGS comprised of SNVs affecting adjacent nucleotides arise from single mutational events, and that most other MSSGS result from the sequential acquisition of SNVs. Some MSSGS drive cancer progression, as exemplified by a TNBC driven by FGFR2(S252W;Y375C).
