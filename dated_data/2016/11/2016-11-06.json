    "abstract": "In systems biology and genomics, epistasis characterizes the impact that a substitution at a particular location in a genome can have on a substitution at another location. This phenomenon is often implicated in the evolution of drug resistance or to explain why particular  disease-causing mutations do not have the same outcome in all individuals. Hence, uncovering these mutations and their locations in a genome is a central question in biology. However, epistasis is notoriously difficult to uncover, especially in fast-evolving organisms. Here, we present a novel statistical approach that replies on a model developed in ecology and that we adapt to analyze genetic data in fast-evolving systems such as the influenza A virus. We validate the approach using a two-pronged strategy: extensive simulations demonstrate a low-to-moderate sensitivity with excellent specificity and precision, while analyses of experimentally-validated data recover known interactions, including in a eukaryotic system. We further evaluate the ability of our approach to detect correlated evolution during antigenic shifts or at the emergence of drug resistance. We show that in all cases, correlated evolution is prevalent in influenza A viruses, involving many pairs of sites linked together in chains, a hallmark of historical contingency. Strikingly, interacting sites are separated by large physical distances, which entails either long-range conformational changes or functional tradeoffs, for which we find support with the emergence of drug resistance. Our work paves a new way for the unbiased detection of epistasis in a wide range of organisms by performing whole-genome scans.",

    "abstract": "Summary statementThe conserved protein kinase CK2 negatively regulates centrosome assembly and is required for proper cell cycle progression and cytokinesis in early C. elegans embryos.\\n\\nAbstractCentrosomes are the primary microtubule-organizing centers that orchestrate microtubule dynamics during the cell cycle. The correct number of centrosomes is pivotal for establishing bipolar mitotic spindles that ensure accurate segregation of chromosomes. Thus, centrioles must duplicate once per cell cycle, one daughter per mother centriole, the process of which requires highly coordinated actions among core factors and modulators. Protein phosphorylation is shown to regulate the stability, localization and activity of centrosome proteins. Here, we report the function of Casein Kinase II (CK2) in early C. elegans embryos. The catalytic subunit (KIN-3/CK2) of CK2 localizes to nuclei, centrosomes and midbodies. Inactivating CK2 leads to cell division defects, including chromosome missegregation, cytokinesis failure and aberrant centrosome behavior. Furthermore, depletion or inhibiting kinase activity of CK2 results in elevated ZYG-1 levels at centrosomes, restoring centrosome duplication and embryonic viability to zyg-1 mutants. Our data suggest that CK2 functions in cell division and negatively regulates centrosome duplication in a kinase-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "Recurring epidemics of kiwifruit (Actinidia spp.) bleeding canker disease are caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa), whose emergence coincided with domestication of its host. The most recent pandemic has had a deleterious effect on kiwifruit production worldwide. In order to strengthen understanding of population structure, phylogeography and evolutionary dynamics of Psa, we sampled 746 Pseudomonas isolates from cultivated and wild kiwifruit across six provinces in China, of which 87 were Psa. Of 234 Pseudomonas isolated from wild Actinidia spp. none were identified as Psa. Genome sequencing of fifty isolates and the inclusion of an additional thirty from previous studies show that China is the origin of the recently emerged pandemic lineage. However China harbours only a fraction of global Psa diversity, with greatest diversity found in Korea and Japan. Distinct transmission events were responsible for introduction of the pandemic lineage of Psa into New Zealand, Chile and Europe. Two independent transmission events occurred between China and Korea, and two Japanese isolates from 2014 cluster with New Zealand Psa. Despite high similarity at the level of the core genome and negligible impact of within-lineage recombination, there has been substantial gene gain and loss even within the single clade from which the global pandemic arose.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTBleeding canker disease of kiwifruit caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa) has come to prominence in the last three decades. Emergence has coincided with domestication of the host plant and provides a rare opportunity to understand ecological and genetic factors affecting the evolutionary origins of Psa. Here, based on genomic analysis of an extensive set of strains sampled from China and augmented by isolates from a global sample, we show, contrary to earlier predictions, that China is not the native home of the pathogen, but is nonetheless the source of the recent global pandemic. Our data identify specific transmission events, substantial genetic diversity and point to non-agricultural plants in either Japan or Korea as home to the source population.",

    "abstract": "Brain dynamics are thought to unfold on a network determined by the pattern of axonal connections linking pairs of neuronal populations; the so-called connectome. Prior work has indicated that structural brain connectivity constrains pairwise correlations in brain dynamics (also called functional connectivity), but it is not known whether inter-regional axonal connectivity is related to the intrinsic dynamics of individual brain areas. Here we investigate this relationship using a weighted, directed mesoscale mouse connectome from the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas and resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) time-series data measured in 184 brain regions in eighteen anesthetized mice. For each brain region, we measured degree, betweenness, and clustering coefficient from weighted and unweighted, and directed and undirected versions of the connectome. We then characterized the univariate rs-fMRI dynamics at each brain region by computing 6 930 time-series properties using the time-series analysis toolbox, hctsa. After correcting for regional volume variations, strong and robust correlations between structural connectivity properties and rs-fMRI dynamics were found only when edge weights were accounted for, and were associated with variations in the autocorrelation properties of the rs-fMRI signal. The strongest relationships were found for weighted in-degree, which was positively correlated to the autocorrelation of fMRI time series at time lag{tau} = 34s (partial Spearman correlation{rho} = 0.58), as well as a range of related measures such as relative high frequency power (f > 0.4 Hz:{rho} = -0.43). Our results indicate that the topology of inter-regional axonal connections of the mouse brain is closely related to intrinsic, spontaneous dynamics such that regions with a greater aggregate strength of incoming projections display longer timescales of activity fluctuations.",

    "abstract": "We model the regulatory role of proteins bound to looped DNA using a simulation in which dsDNA is represented as a self-avoiding chain, and proteins as spherical protrusions. We simu-late long self-avoiding chains using a sequential importance sampling Monte-Carlo algorithm, and compute the probabilities for chain looping with and without a protrusion. We find that a protrusion near one of the chains termini reduces the probability of looping, even for chains much longer than the protrusion-chain-terminus distance. This effect increases with protrusion size, and decreases with protrusion-terminus distance. The reduced probability of looping can be explained via an eclipse-like model, which provides a novel inhibitory mechanism. We test the eclipse model on two possible transcription-factor occupancy states of the eve 3/7 enhancer, and show that it provides a possible explanation for the experimentally-observed eve stripe 3 and 7 expression patterns.\\n\\nThe authors declare no conflict of interests",

    "abstract": "Previous studies in humans interested in inhibitory synaptic activity at the level of the primary motor cortex (M1) have frequently used an electrophysiological technique call short intracortical inhibition (SICI). This technique consists of two subsequent pulses with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), of which the first pulse (S1) has been argued to target local inhibitory connections, reducing corticospinal output generated by the second pulse (S2). However, the reduction of corticospinal output is not seen in every tested subject, sometimes S1 even increased corticospinal output. Thus there seems to be more occurring than just the targeting of local inhibitory connections by S1, indicating that the mechanisms of SICI are not fully understood. In the present study, in 18 healthy young subjects we applied a method allowing to segregate corticospinal volleys with different conduction times and investigated the effect of S1 on the excitation of these volleys. Our results revealed three major findings, which can be summarized as follows: i) S1 acted not only locally at the level of M1, but produced corticospinal activity which may influence corticospinal output by S2 at the spinal level; ii) there was not only reduced excitation of corticospinal volleys by S1, but also an increased excitation of corticospinal volleys with longer conduction times; iii) at the level of M1, S1 indeed targeted preferentially inhibitory synaptic connections, and these reduced corticospinal excitation of the fastest conduction corticospinal volleys.\\n\\nOur results indicate that underlying mechanisms in studies applying SICI should be interpreted with caution.",
