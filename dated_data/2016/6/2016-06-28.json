    "abstract": "Functional neuroimaging techniques have transformed our ability to probe the neurobiological basis of behaviour and are increasingly being applied by the wider neuroscience community. However, concerns have recently been raised that the conclusions drawn from some human neuroimaging studies are either spurious or not generalizable. Problems such as low statistical power, flexibility in data analysis, software errors, and lack of direct replication apply to many fields, but perhaps particularly to fMRI. Here we discuss these problems, outline current and suggested best practices, and describe how we think the field should evolve to produce the most meaningful answers to neuroscientific questions.",

    "abstract": "Enhancers physically interact with transcriptional promoters, looping over distances that can span multiple regulatory elements. Given that enhancer-promoter (EP) interactions generally occur via common protein complexes, it is unclear whether EP pairing is predominantly deterministic or proximity guided. Here we present cross-organismic evidence suggesting that most EP pairs are compatible, largely determined by physical proximity rather than specific interactions. By re-analyzing transcriptome datasets, we find that the transcription of gene neighbors is correlated over distances that scale with genome size. We experimentally show that non-specific EP interactions can explain such correlation, and that EP distance acts as a scaling factor for the transcriptional influence of an enhancer. We propose that enhancer sharing is commonplace among eukaryotes, and that EP distance is an important layer of information in gene regulation.",

    "abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in various biological functions including regulation of gene expression, X-inactivation, imprinting, cell proliferation and differentiation. However, the functionality of lncRNAs is not clearly understood and conflicting conclusions have often been reached when comparing different methods to investigate them. Moreover, little is known about the upstream regulation of lncRNAs. Here we show that a transcriptional co activator - PC4 and SF2 interacting protein (Psip1)/p52, which is involved in linking transcription to RNA processing, regulates the expression of the lncRNA Hottip. Using complementary approaches - knockdown, Cas9 mediated lncRNA deletion, analysis of lncRNA binding by Chromatin isolation by RNA purification (ChIRP) - we demonstrate that Hottip binds to the 5 Hoxa genes located in cis, which leads to their upregulation. Moreover, the synthetic activation of Hottip is sufficient to induce the expression ofpolycomb repressed Hox genes in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs).",

    "abstract": "Fluorescent lipophilic dyes, such as DiI, stain cellular membranes and are used extensively for retrograde/anterograde labelling of neurons as well as for marking the position of extracellular electrodes after electrophysiology. Convenient histological clearing techniques, such as CLARITY, enable immunostaining and imaging of large volumes for 3D-reconstruction. However, such clearing works by removing lipids and, as an unintended consequence, also removes lipophilic dyes. To remedy this wash-out, the molecular structure of the dye can be altered to adhere to both membranes and proteins so the dye remains in the tissue after lipid-clearing. Nevertheless, the capacity of such modified dyes to remain in tissue has not yet been tested. Here, we test dyes with molecular modifications that make them aldehyde-fixable to proteins. We use three Dil-analogue dyes, CM-DiI, SP-DiI and FM 1-43FX that are modified to be CLARITY-compatible candidates. We use the challenging adult, myelin-rich spinal cord tissue, which requires prolonged lipid-clearing, of rats and mice. All three dyes remained in the tissue after lipid-clearing, but CM-DiI had the sharpest and FM 1-43FX the strongest fluorescent signal.",

    "abstract": "Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) employ a sophisticated chemosensory apparatus to detect potential hosts. Understanding the molecular basis of relevant host-finding behaviours could facilitate improved EPN biocontrol approaches, and could lend insight to similar behaviours in economically important mammalian parasites. FMRFamide-like peptides are enriched and conserved across the Phylum Nematoda, and have been linked with motor and sensory function, including dispersal and aggregating behaviours in the free living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The RNA interference (RNAi) pathway of Steinernema carpocapsae was characterised in silico, and employed to knockdown the expression of the FMRFamide-like protein 21 (GLGPRPLRFamide) gene (flp-21) in S. carpocapsae infective juveniles; a first instance of RNAi in this genus, and a first in an infective juvenile of any EPN species. Our data show that 5 mg/ml dsRNA and 50 mM serotonin triggers statistically significant flp-21 knockdown (-84%***) over a 48 h timecourse, which inhibits host-finding (chemosensory), dispersal, hyperactive nictation and jumping behaviours. However, whilst 1 mg/ml dsRNA and 50 mM serotonin also triggers statistically significant flp-21 knockdown (-51%**) over a 48 h timecourse, it does not trigger the null sensory phenotypes; statistically significant target knockdown can still lead to false negative results, necessitating appropriate experimental design. SPME GC-MS volatile profiles of two EPN hosts, Galleria mellonella and Tenebrio molitor reveal an array of shared and unique compounds; these differences had no impact on null flp-21 RNAi phenotypes for the behaviours assayed. Localisation of flp-21 / FLP-21 to paired anterior neurons by whole mount in situ hybridisation and immunocytochemistry corroborates the RNAi data, further suggesting a role in sensory modulation. These data can underpin efforts to study these behaviours in other economically important parasites, and could facilitate molecular approaches to EPN strain improvement for biocontrol.\\n\\nAuthor summaryEntomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) use a range of behaviours in order to find a suitable host, some of which are shared with important mammalian parasites. The ethical burden of conducting research on parasites which require a mammalian host has driven a move towards appropriate  model parasites, like EPNs, which have short life cycles, can be cultured in insects or agar plates, and have excellent genomic resources. This study aimed to develop a method for triggering gene knockdown by RNA interference, a biochemical pathway involved in gene regulation. Through knocking down the expression of a target gene we can then study the function of that gene, helping us to understand the molecular basis of behaviour. Here we have characterised the RNAi pathway of Steinernema carpocapsae through analysing the genome sequence for relevant genes, and have successfully knocked down the neuropeptide gene flp-21 in S. carpocapsae infective juveniles. We find that it is involved in the regulation of behaviours which rely on sensory perception and relate to host-finding. We have localised the gene and mature neuropeptide, and find them to be expressed in paired anterior neurons, which is in broad agreement with our behavioural observations following RNAi. Our observations are relevant to interactions of S. carpocapsae with two insect hosts, the waxworm Galleria mellonella, and the meelworm, Tenebrio molitor. We identified the volatile compounds relating to both insects, and find that there are both shared and unique compounds to both species; EPNs use volatile compound gradients, as well as other physical cues in order to find and invade a host. This study provides a method for employing RNAi in a promising model parasite, and characterises the molecular basis of host-finding behaviours which could be relevant to economically important mammalian parasites. EPNs are also used as bioinsecticides, and so understanding their behaviour and biology could have broad benefits across industry and academia.",

Furthermore, animal models of human neurodegenerative diseases have failed dramatically, and the success rate of clinical trials based on these models has been disappointing. Here, we describe a novel and robust human brain organoid system that is highly specific to the midbrain derived from regionally patterned neuroepithelial stem cells. These human midbrain organoids contain spatially organized groups of dopaminergic neurons, which make them an attractive model to study Parkinsons disease. Midbrain organoids are characterized in detail for neuronal, astroglial and oligodendrocyte differentiation. Furthermore, we show the presence of synaptic connections and electrophysiological activity. The complexity of this model is further highlighted by the myelination of neurites. The present midbrain organoid system has the potential to be used for advanced in vitro disease modeling and therapy development.",

    "abstract": "Coordinated collective behaviors often emerge from simple rules governing the interactions of individuals in groups. We model mechanisms of coordination among ants during cooperative transport, a challenging task that requires a consensus on travel direction. Decisions required for cooperative transport differ from other, well-studied consensus decisions because groups often deadlock, with individuals trying to move in opposing directions, and cooperative transport groups are often relatively small. Small groups may be more affected by individual nonconformity. Using deterministic and stochastic models, we investigate behavioral factors that affect deadlock duration. Our goal is to determine whether groups following simple behavioral rules can reach a consensus using minimal information. We define and investigate multiple types of behavioral rules that govern individual behavior and also differ in the information available. We find that if individuals more readily give up when they are going against the majority, groups rapidly break deadlocks. This occurs through positive and negative feedbacks that are implemented in our model via a single mechanism. We also find that to quickly reach a consensus, groups must have either a shared bias, high sensitivity to group behavior, or finely tuned persistence. While inspired by ants, our results are generalizable to other collective decisions with deadlocks, and demonstrate that groups of behaviorally simple individuals with no memory and extremely limited information can break symmetry and reach a consensus in a decision between two equal options",

Bradycardia during exposure to CO2 is associated with nociception and pain. However, it is unclear if bradycardia occurs before loss of consciousness as this is variably defined in the literature. The objectives of this study were to explore the relationship between recumbency, loss of righting reflex (LORR) and a quiescent electromyograph as measures of loss of consciousness, and identify the onset of bradycardia in relation to these measures.\\n\\nMethods:\\n\\nThirty-two adult, female Sprague-Dawley rats were instrumented with a telemetry device and randomly assigned to one of four killing methods (100% CO2, CO2 (70%)/O2 (30%), isoflurane (5%) and intraperitoneal pentobarbital (200 mg/kg). Time to achieve recumbency, LORR, quiescent electromyograph, isoelectric electrocorticograph, heart rate and apnea were recorded.\\n\\nResults:\\n\\nThe general order of progression was recumbency, LORR, quiescent electromyograph, isoelectric electrocorticograph and apnea. Recumbency preceded LORR in the majority of animals (CO2; 7/8, CO2/O2; 8/8, isoflurane; 5/8, pentobarbital; 4/8). Bradycardia occurred before recumbency in the CO2 (p = 0.0002) and CO2/O2 (p = 0.005) groups, with a 50% reduction in heart rate compared to baseline. The slowest (time to apnea) and least consistent killing methods were CO2/O2 (1180 {+/-} 658.1s) and pentobarbital (875 [239 to 4680]s).\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\nBradycardia, and consequently nociception and pain, occurs before loss of consciousness during CO2 exposure. Pentobarbital displayed an unexpected lack of consistency, questioning its classification as an acceptable euthanasia method in rats.",

High-order statistics are critical for conveying local features, but they are challenging to study, largely because their number and variety is large. Here, via the use of two-dimensional Hermite (TDH) functions, we identify a covert symmetry in high-order statistics of natural images that simplifies this task. This emerges from the structure of TDH functions, which are an orthogonal set of functions that are organized into a hierarchy of ranks. Specifically, we find that the shape (skewness and kurtosis) of the distribution of filter coefficients depends only on the projection of the function onto a 1-dimensional subspace specific to each rank. The characterization of natural image statistics provided by TDH filter coefficients reflects both their phase and amplitude structure, and we suggest an intuitive interpretation for the special subspace within each rank.",

    "abstract": "Background: The first Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) genome assembly published in 2011 was one of the early genome assemblies exclusively based on high-throughput 454 pyrosequencing. Since then, rapid advances in sequencing technologies have led to a multitude of assemblies generated for complex genomes, although many of these are of a fragmented nature with a significant fraction of bases in gaps. The development of long-read sequencing and improved software now enable the generation of more contiguous genome assemblies.\\n\\nResults: By combining data from Illumina, 454 and the longer PacBio sequencing technologies, as well as integrating the results of multiple assembly programs, we have created a substantially improved version of the Atlantic cod genome assembly. The sequence contiguity of this assembly is increased fifty-fold and the proportion of gap-bases has been reduced fifteen-fold. Compared to other vertebrates, the assembly contains an unusual high density of tandem repeats (TRs). Indeed, retrospective analyses reveal that gaps in the first genome assembly were largely associated with these TRs. We show that 21 % of the TRs across the assembly, 19 % in the promoter regions and 12 % in the coding sequences are heterozygous in the sequenced individual.\\n\\nConclusions: The inclusion of PacBio reads combined with the use of multiple assembly programs drastically improved the Atlantic cod genome assembly by successfully resolving long TRs. The high frequency of heterozygous TRs within or in the vicinity of genes in the genome indicate a considerable standing genomic variation in Atlantic cod populations, which is likely of evolutionary importance.",

    "abstract": "Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are gene modules that appear to be widely horizontally mobile. It has been proposed that type I TA systems, with an antisense RNA-antitoxin, are less mobile than other TAs but no direct comparisons have been made. We searched for type I, II and III toxin families on chromosomes, plasmids and phages across bacterial phyla.The distribution of type I TA systems were more narrow than most type II and III system families, though this was less true of more recently discovered families.We discuss how the function and phenotypes of type I TA systems as well as biases in our databases and discovery of these modules may account for differences in their distribution.",

    "abstract": "The mitotic spindle ensures the faithful segregation of chromosomes. To discover the nature of the crucial centrosome-to-chromosome connection during mitosis, we combined the first large-scale serial electron tomography of whole mitotic spindles in early C. elegans embryos with live-cell imaging. Using tomography, we reconstructed the positions of all microtubules in 3D, and identified their plus- and minus-ends. We classified them as kinetochore (KMTs), spindle (SMTs), or astral microtubules (AMTs) according to their positions, and quantified distinct properties of each class. While our light microscopy and mutant studies show that microtubules are nucleated from the centrosomes, we find only a few KMTs are directly connected to the centrosomes. Indeed, by quantitatively analysing several models of microtubule growth, we conclude that minus-ends of KMTs have selectively detached and depolymerized from the centrosome. In toto, our results show that the connection between centrosomes and chromosomes is mediated by an anchoring into the entire spindle network and that any direct connections through KMTs are few and likely very transient.",

    "abstract": "NOTEThe biases seen in simulations of Temporal Clustering appear to be even worse in real applications. While this was a novel and interesting approach, ultimately this work has been discontinued. I feel the biases are due to propagated error in estimating individual level offsets based on a single noisy measure, amplified by the fact that high MMSE scores change very slowly and therefore many estimates are from near an asymptote on the left hand of the model. We continue to work in this area, with other approaches showing significantly more promise.\\n\\nUnderstanding heterogeneity in Alzheimers disease (AD) progression is critically important for the optimal design of trials, allowing participants to be recruited who are correctly diagnosed and who are likely to undergo cognitive decline. Current knowledge about heterogeneity is limited by the paucity of long-term follow-up data and methodological challenges. Of the latter, a key problem is how to choose the most appropriate  time zero to use in longitudinal models, a choice which affects results. Rather than a pre-specified  time zero we propose a novel methodology - Temporal Clustering - that defines a new  time zero using individual offsets inferred from the data. We applied this to longitudinal Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), where this approach ensures that individuals have similar estimated MMSE scores at this new  time zero. Simulations showed that it could accurately predict cluster membership after the application of a filter. Next we applied it to a cohort of 2412 individuals, with large variability in MMSE score at first visit. Temporal Clustering was used to split individuals into two clusters. The group showing faster decline had higher average levels of AD risk factors: cerebrospinal fluid tau and APOE [isin]4. Cluster membership predicted by Temporal Clustering was less affected by individuals cognitive ability at first visit than was the case for clusters found using Latent Class Mixture Models. Further application and development of this method will help researchers to identify risk factors affecting cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "Chimeras - organisms that are composed of cells of more than one genotype - captured the human imagination long before they were formally described and used in the laboratory. These organisms owe their namesake to a fire-breathing monster from Greek mythology that has the head of a lion, the body of a goat, and the tail of a serpent. The first description of a non-fictional chimera dates back to the middle of the seventeenth century when the Florentine gardener Pietro Nati discovered an adventitious shoot growing from the graft junction between sour orange (Citrus aurantium) and citron (C. medica). This perplexing chimera that grows with sectors phenotypically resembling each of the citrus progenitors inspired discussion and wonder from the scientific community and was fittingly named the  Bizzaria. Initially, the  Bizzaria was believed to be an asexual hybrid that formed from a cellular fusion between the grafted parents; however, in-depth cellular analyses carried out centuries later demonstrated that the  Bizzaria, along with other chimeras, owe their unique sectored appearance to a conglomeration of cells from the two donors. Since this pivotal discovery at the turn of the twentieth century, chimeras have served both as tools and as unique biological phenomena that have contributed to our understanding of plant development at the cellular, tissue, and organismal level. Rapid advancements in genome sequencing technologies have enabled the establishment of new model species with novel morphological and developmental features that enable the generation of chimeric organisms. In this review, we show that genetic mosaic and chimera studies provide a technologically simple way to delve into the organismal, genetic, and genomic inner workings underlying the development of diverse model organisms. Moreover, we discuss the unique opportunity that chimeras present to explore universal principles governing intercellular communication and the coordination of organismal biology in a heterogenomic landscape.",

    "abstract": "A number of important pluripotency regulators, including the transcription factor Nanog, are observed to fluctuate stochastically in individual embryonic stem (ES) cells. By transiently priming cells for commitment to different lineages, these fluctuations are thought to be important to the maintenance of, and exit from, pluripotency. However, since temporal changes in intracellular protein abundances cannot be measured directly in live cells, these fluctuations are typically assessed using genetically engineered reporter cell lines that produce a fluorescent signal as a proxy for protein expression. Here, using a combination of mathematical modeling and experiment, we show that there are unforeseen ways in which widely used reporter strategies can systemically disturb the dynamics they are intended to monitor, sometimes giving profoundly misleading results. In the case of Nanog we show how genetic reporters can compromise the behavior of important pluripotency-sustaining positive feedback loops, and induce a bifurcation in the underlying dynamics that gives rise to heterogeneous Nanog expression patterns in reporter cell lines that are not representative of the wild-type. These findings help explain the range of published observations of Nanog variability and highlight a fundamental measurement problem in cell biology.",

    "abstract": "Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are major determinants of gene silencing and epigenetic memory in higher eukaryotes. Here, we used a robust affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) approach to systematically map the human PcG protein interactome, uncovering an unprecedented breadth of PcG complexes. The obtained high density protein interaction data identified new modes of combinatorial PcG complex formation with proteins previously not associated with the PcG system, thus providing new insights into their molecular function and recruitment mechanisms to target genes. Importantly, we identified two human PR-DUB de-ubiquitination complexes, which comprise the O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase OGT1 and a number of transcription factors. By further mapping chromatin binding of PR-DUB components genome-wide, we conclude that the human PR-DUB and PRC1 complexes bind distinct sets of target genes and impact on different cellular processes in mammals.",
