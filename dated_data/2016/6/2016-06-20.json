    "abstract": "The vertebrate adaptive immune system provides a flexible and diverse set of molecules to neutralize pathogens. Yet, viruses such as HIV can cause chronic infections by evolving as quickly as the adaptive immune system, forming an evolutionary arms race. Here we introduce a mathematical framework to study the coevolutionary dynamics of antibodies with antigens within a host. We focus on changes in the binding interactions between the antibody and antigen populations, which result from the underlying stochastic evolution of genotype frequencies driven by mutation, selection, and drift. We identify the critical viral and immune parameters that determine the distribution of antibody-antigen binding affinities. We also identify definitive signatures of coevolution that measure the reciprocal response between antibodies and viruses, and we introduce experimentally measurable quantities that quantify the extent of adaptation during continual coevolution of the two opposing populations. Using this analytical framework, we infer rates of viral and immune adaptation based on time-shifted neutralization assays in two HIV-infected patients. Finally, we analyze competition between clonal lineages of antibodies and characterize the fate of a given lineage in terms of the state of the antibody and viral populations. In particular, we derive the conditions that favor the emergence of broadly neutralizing antibodies, which may be useful in designing a vaccine against HIV.",

    "abstract": "Premise of the studyShifts in ploidy affect the evolutionary dynamics of genomes in a myriad of ways. Population genetic theory predicts that transposable element (TE) proliferation may follow because the genome wide efficacy of selection should be reduced and the increase in gene copies may mask the deleterious effects of TE insertions. Moreover, in allopolyploids TEs may further accumulate because of hybrid breakdown of TE silencing. However, to date the evidence of TE proliferation following an increase in ploidy is mixed, and the relative importance of relaxed selection vs. silencing breakdown remains unclear.\\n\\nMethodsWe used high-coverage whole genome sequence data to evaluate the abundance, genomic distribution, and population frequencies of TEs in the self-fertilizing recent allotetraploid Capsella bursa-pastoris (Brassicaceae). We then compared the C. bursa-pastoris TE profile with that of its two parental diploid species, outcrossing C. grandiflora and self-fertilizing C. orientalis.\\n\\nKey resultsWe found no evidence that C. bursa-pastoris has experienced a large genome wide proliferation of TEs relative to its parental species. However, when centromeric regions are excluded, we find evidence of significantly higher abundance of retrotransposons in C. bursa-pastoris along the gene-rich chromosome arms, compared to C.grandiflora and C. orientalis.\\n\\nConclusionsThe lack of a genome-wide effect of allopolyploidy on TE abundance, combined with the increases TE abundance in gene-rich regions suggest that relaxed selection rather than hybrid breakdown of host silencing explains the TE accumulation in C. bursa-pastoris",

    "abstract": "Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are increasingly used for explaining biological processes with complex transcriptional regulation. A GRN links the expression levels of a set of genes via regulatory controls that gene products exert on one another. Boolean networks are a common modeling choice since they balance between detail and ease of analysis. However, even for Boolean networks the problem of fitting a given network model to an expression dataset is NP-Complete. Previous methods have addressed this issue heuristically or by focusing on acyclic networks and specific classes of regulation functions. In this paper we introduce a novel algorithm for this problem that makes use of sampling in order to handle large datasets. Our algorithm can handle time series data for any network type and steady state data for acyclic networks. Using in-silico time series data we demonstrate good performance on large datasets with a significant level of noise.",

    "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a heritable and highly debilitating condition. It is commonly associated with subcortical volumetric abnormalities, the most replicated of these being reduced hippocampal volume. Using the most recent published data from ENIGMA consortiums genome-wide association study (GWAS) of regional brain volume, we sought to test whether there is shared genetic architecture between 8 subcortical brain volumes and MDD. Using LD score regression utilising summary statistics from ENIGMA and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, we demonstrated that hippocampal volume was positively genetically correlated with MDD (rG=0.46, P=0.02), although this did not survive multiple comparison testing. None of other six brain regions studied were genetically correlated and amygdala volume heritability was too low for analysis. We also generated polygenic risk scores (PRS) to assess potential pleiotropy between regional brain volumes and MDD in three cohorts (Generation Scotland; Scottish Family Health Study (n=19,762), UK Biobank (n=24,048) and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (n=5,766). We used logistic regression to examine volumetric PRS and MDD and performed a meta-analysis across the three cohorts. No regional volumetric PRS demonstrated significant association with MDD or recurrent MDD. In this study we provide some evidence that hippocampal volume and MDD may share genetic architecture, albeit this did not survive multiple testing correction and was in the opposite direction to most reported phenotypic correlations. We therefore found no evidence to support a shared genetic architecture for MDD and regional subcortical volumes.",

    "abstract": "Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is an ubiquitously used tool for evaluating pathway enrichment in transcriptional data. Typical experimental design consists in comparing two conditions with several replicates using a differential gene expression test followed by preranked GSEA performed against a collection of hundreds and thousands of pathways. However, the reference implementation of this method cannot accurately estimate small P-values, which significantly limits its sensitivity due to multiple hypotheses correction procedure.\n\nHere we present FGSEA (Fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) method that is able to estimate arbitrarily low GSEA P-values with a high accuracy in a matter of minutes or even seconds. To confirm the accuracy of the method, we also developed an exact algorithm for GSEA P-values calculation for integer gene-level statistics. Using the exact algorithm as a reference we show that FGSEA is able to routinely estimate P-values up to 10-100 with a small and predictable estimation error. We systematically evaluate FGSEA on a collection of 605 datasets and show that FGSEA recovers much more statistically significant pathways compared to other implementations.\n\nFGSEA is open source and available as an R package in Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org/packages/fgsea/) and on GitHub (https://github.com/ctlab/fgsea/).",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe human gut contains approximately 1014 bacteria, belonging to hundreds of different species. Together, these microbial species form a complex food web that can break down food sources that our own digestive enzymes cannot handle, including complex polysaccharides, producing short chain fatty acids and additional metabolites, e.g., vitamin K. The diversity of microbial diversity is important for colonic health: Changes in the composition of the microbiota have been associated with inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, obestity and Crohns disease, and make the microbiota more vulnerable to infestation by harmful species, e.g., Clostridium difficile. To get a grip on the controlling factors of microbial diversity in the gut, we here propose a multi-scale, spatiotemporal dynamic flux-balance analysis model to study the emergence of metabolic diversity in a spatial gut-like, tubular environment. The model features genome-scale metabolic models of microbial populations, resource sharing via extracellular metabolites, and spatial population dynamics and evolution.\\n\\nResultsIn this model, cross-feeding interactions emerge readily, despite the species ability to metabolize sugars autonomously. Interestingly, the community requires cross-feeding for producing a realistic set of short-chain fatty acids from an input of glucose, If we let the composition of the microbial subpopulations change during invasion of adjacent space, a complex and stratifed microbiota evolves, with subspecies specializing on cross-feeding interactions via a mechanism of compensated trait loss. The microbial diversity and stratification collapse if the flux through the gut is enhanced to mimic diarrhea.\\n\\nConclusionsIn conclusion, this in silico model is a helpful tool in systems biology to predict and explain the controlling factors of microbial diversity in the gut. It can be extended to include, e.g., complex food source, and host-microbiota interactions via the gut wall.",

    "abstract": "The native horse population of Iceland has remained free of major infectious diseases. Between May and July 2010 an epidemic of respiratory disease swept through the population. Initial microbiological investigations ruled out known equine viral agents as the cause of the infections, but identified the opportunistic pathogen Streptococcus zooepidemicus as being frequently isolated from diseased animals. This diverse bacterial species has a broad host range and is usually regarded as a commensal of horses. By genome sequencing S. zooepidemicus recovered from horses during the epidemic we show that although multiple clones of S. zooepidemicus were present in the population, one particular clone, ST209, was responsible for the epidemic. Concurrent with the epidemic, ST209 caused zoonotic infections, highlighting the pathogenic potential of this clone. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the original ST209 strain entered Iceland in late 2008 or early 2009. Epidemiological investigation revealed that the incursion of this strain into a training yard that utilized a submerged treadmill between the 5th and 19th of February 2010 was a critical trigger for the ensuing epidemic of disease, provided a nidus for the infection of multiple horses, and subsequent distribution of these animals to multiple sites in Iceland.",

    "abstract": "How cold-blooded animals adapt their behaviour and physiology to survive seasonal changes in temperature is not completely understood - even for well-studied model organisms like Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we show that Drosophila can extend their viable temperature range through temperature-dependent changes in feeding behaviour. Above 15{degrees}C, Drosophila feed and lay eggs on yeast. In contrast, below 15{degrees}C, Drosophila prefer to feed and lay eggs on plant material. The different lipids present in yeast and plants improve survival at high and low temperatures, respectively. Yeast lipids promote high tempera-ture survival by increasing systemic insulin signalling. This expands the range over which developmental rate increases with temperature, suggesting that faster nutrient utilization is required to fuel biochemical reactions driven faster by ki-netic energy. In addition to speeding development, yeast lipids increase fertility. Thus, yeast provide cues that could help Drosophila to exploit a transient summer food resource. Plant lipids, on the other hand, are required to maintain mem-brane lipid fluidity at low temperature, and increase cold-resistance of larvae and adults. The cold-resistance and lowered insulin signalling conferred by feeding on plants allows adults to survive for many months at temperatures consistent with overwintering in temperate climates. Thus, temperature-dependent changes in feeding behaviour produce physiological changes that could promote seasonal adaption.",

We found that decomposition of plant litter with higher C:N ratios was only beginning and was stimulated by AMF, whereas decomposition of plant litter with lower C:N ratios had already progressed and was decreased by AMF.
