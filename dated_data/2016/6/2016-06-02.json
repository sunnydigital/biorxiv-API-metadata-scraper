    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of drug resistance remains a critical public health concern. The treatment of influenza A virus (IAV) has proven particularly challenging, due to the ability of the virus to develop resistance against current antivirals and vaccines. Here we evaluate a novel antiviral drug therapy, favipiravir, for which the mechanism of action in IAV involves an interaction with the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase resulting in an effective increase in the viral mutation rate. We utilized an experimental evolution framework, combined with novel population genetic method development for inference from time-sampled data, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of favipiravir against IAV. Evaluating whole genome polymorphism data across fifteen time points under multiple drug concentrations and in controls, we present the first evidence for the ability of viral populations to effectively adapt to low concentrations of favipiravir. In contrast, under high concentrations, we observe population extinction, indicative of mutational meltdown. We discuss the observed dynamics with respect to the evolutionary forces at play and emphasize the utility of evolutionary theory to inform drug development.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we present Tellurium, a powerful Python-based integrated environment designed for model building, analysis, simulation and reproducibility in systems and synthetic biology. Tellurium is a modular, cross-platform, and open-source integrated development environment (IDE) composed of multiple libraries, plugins, and specialized modules and methods. Tellurium ensures exchangeability and reproducibility of computational models by supporting SBML (Systems Biology Markup Language), SED-ML (Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language), the COMBINE archive, and SBOL (Synthetic Biology Open Language). Tellurium is a self-contained modeling platform which comes with a fully configured Python distribution independent of other local Python installations on the target machine. The main interface is based on the Spyder IDE which has a highly accessible user interface akin to MATLAB (https://www.mathworks.com/). Tellurium uses libRoadRunner as the default SBML simulation engine due to its superior performance, scalability and ease of integration. libRoadRunner supports deterministic simulations, stochastic simulations and steady state analyses. Tellurium also includes Antimony, a human-readable model definition language which can be converted to and from SBML. Other standard Python scientific libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib are included by default. Additionally, we include several user-friendly plugins and advanced modules for a wide-variety of applications, ranging from visualization tools to complex algorithms for bifurcation analysis and multi-dimensional parameter scanning. By combining multiple libraries, plugins, and modules into a single package, Tellurium provides a unified but extensible solution for biological modeling and simulation.",

Our methodology based on a kinematic analysis of cell lineage data reveals deformation patterns and quantitative morphogenetic landmarks for a new type of developmental table. The characteristic spatial and temporal length scales of mechanical deformation patterns derived from a continuous approximation of cell displacements indicate a compressible fluid-like behavior of zebrafish gastrulating tissues. The instantaneous deformation rate at the mesoscopic level of the cells neighborhood is spatially and temporally heterogeneous. The robustness of mechanical patterns results from their cumulative history along cell trajectories. Unsupervised classification of mechanical descriptor profiles was used to assess the homogeneity of biomechanical cues in cell populations. Further clustering of cell trajectories according to their cumulative mesoscopic biomechanical history during gastrulation revealed ordered and coherent spatiotemporal patterns comparable to that of the embryonic fate map.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have identified a number of novel genetic loci linked to serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels. The causal DNA variants at these loci and the mechanisms by which they influence phenotype and disease risk remain largely unexplored. Expression quantitative trait locus analyses of patient liver and fat biopsies indicate that many lipid-associated variants influence gene expression in a cis-regulatory manner. However, linkage disequilibrium among neighboring SNPs at a genome-wide association study-implicated locus makes it challenging to pinpoint the actual variant underlying an association signal. We used a methodological framework for causal variant discovery that involves high-throughput identification of putative disease-causal loci through a functional reporter-based screen, the massively parallel reporter assay, followed by validation of prioritized variants in genome-edited human pluripotent stem cell models generated with CRISPR-Cas9. We complemented the stem cell models with CRISPR interference experiments in vitro and in knock-in mice in vivo. We provide validation for two high-priority SNPs, rs2277862 and rs10889356, being causal for lipid-associated expression quantitative trait loci. We also highlight the challenges inherent in modeling common genetic variation with these experimental approaches.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryGenome-wide association studies have identified numerous loci linked to a variety of clinical phenotypes. It remains a challenge to identify and validate the causal DNA variants in these loci. We describe the use of a high-throughput technique called the massively parallel reporter assay to analyze thousands of candidate causal DNA variants for their potential effects on gene expression. We use a combination of genome editing in human pluripotent stem cells, \\\"CRISPR interference\\\" experiments in other cultured human cell lines, and genetically modified mice to analyze the two highest-priority candidate DNA variants to emerge from the massively parallel reporter assay, and we confirm the relevance of the variants to nearby gene expression. These findings highlight a methodological framework with which to identify and functionally validate causal DNA variants.",

    "abstract": "How multicellular organisms maintain immune homeostasis across various organs and cell types is an outstanding question in immune biology and cell signaling. In Drosophila, blood cells (hemocytes) respond to local and systemic cues to mount an immune response. While endosomal regulation of Drosophila hematopoiesis is reported, the role of endosomal proteins in cellular and humoral immunity is not well-studied. Here we demonstrate a functional role for endosomal proteins in immune homeostasis. We show that the ubiquitous trafficking protein ADP Ribosylation Factor 1 (ARF1) and the hemocyte-specific endosomal regulator Asrij differentially regulate humoral immunity. ARF1 and Asrij mutants show reduced survival and lifespan upon infection, indicating perturbed immune homeostasis. The ARF1-Asrij axis suppresses the Toll pathway anti-microbial peptides (AMPs) by regulating ubiquitination of the inhibitor Cactus. The Imd pathway is inversely regulated-while ARF1 suppresses AMPs, Asrij is essential for AMP production. Several immune mutants have reduced Asrij expression, suggesting that Asrij co-ordinates with these pathways to regulate the immune response. Our study highlights the role of endosomal proteins in modulating the immune response by maintaining the balance of AMP production. Similar mechanisms can now be tested in mammalian hematopoiesis and immunity.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 75% of breast cancers express estrogen receptor  (ER) and depend on estrogen signals for continued growth. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) prevent estrogen production and inhibit estrogen receptor signaling, resulting in decreased cancer recurrence and mortality. Advanced tumors treated with AIs almost always develop resistance to these drugs via the up-regulation of alternative growth signals. The mechanisms that drive this resistance--especially epigenetic events that alter gene expression--are however not well understood. Genome-wide DNA methylation and expression analysis of cell line models of acquired aromatase inhibitor resistance indicated that prostaglandin E2 receptor 4 (PTGER4) is up-regulated after demethylation in resistant cells. Knockdown and inhibitor studies demonstrate that PTGER4 is essential for estrogen independent growth. Analysis of downstream signaling indicates that PTGER4 likely promotes AI resistance via ligand independent activation of the ER-cofactor CARM1. We believe that we have discovered a novel epigenetic mechanism for altering cell signaling and acquiring endocrine therapy resistance. Our findings indicate that PTGER4 is a potential drug target in AI resistant cancers. Additionally, the epigenetic component of PTGER4 regulation suggests that further study of PTGER4 may yield valuable insights into how DNA methylation-targeted diagnoses and treatments can improve AI resistant breast cancer treatment.",

If correct, this hypothesis implies that successful therapy must focus primarily on eradication of this CSC fraction. However, recent evidence suggests stemness is niche dependent and may represent one of many phenotypic states that can be accessed by many cancer genotypes when presented with specific environmental cues. A better understanding of the relationship of stemness to niche-related phenotypic plasticity could lead to alternative treatment strategies.\\n\\nMethodsHere we investigate the role of environmental context in the expression of stem-like cell properties through in-silico simulation of ductal carcinoma. We develop a two-dimensional hybrid discrete-continuum cellular automata model to describe the single cell scale dynamics of multi-cellular tissue formation. Through a suite of simulations we investigate interactions between a phenotypically heterogeneous cancer cell population and a dynamic environment.\\n\\nResultsWe generate homeostatic ductal structures that consist of a mixture of stem and differentiated cells governed by both intracellular and environmental dynamics. We demonstrate that a wide spectrum of tumor-like histologies can result from these structures by varying microenvironmental parameters.\\n\\nConclusionNiche driven phenotypic plasticity offers a simple first-principle explanation for the diverse ductal structures observed in histological sections from breast cancer.\\n\\nSignificanceConventional models of carcinogenesis largely focus on mutational events.

We now show that the KRAB domain of PRDM9 forms complexes with additional proteins to allow hotspots to proceed into the next phase of recombination. By a combination of yeast-two hybrid assay, in vitro binding, and co-immunoprecipitation from mouse spermatocytes, we identified four proteins that directly interact with PRDM9s KRAB domain, namely CXXC1, EWSR1, EHMT2, and CDYL. These proteins are co-expressed in spermatocytes at the early stages of meiotic prophase I, the limited period when PRDM9 is expressed. We also detected association of PRDM9-bound complexes with the meiotic cohesin REC8 and the synaptonemal complex proteins SYCP3 and SYCP1. Our results suggest a model in which PRDM9-bound hotspot DNA is brought to the chromosomal axis by the action of these proteins, ensuring the proper chromatin and spatial environment for subsequent recombination events.",

    "abstract": "Neural synchrony has been suggested as mechanism for integrating distributed sensorimotor systems involved in coordinated movement. To test the role of corticomuscular and intermuscular coherence in the formation of bimanual muscle synergies, we experimentally manipulated the degree of coordination between hand muscles by varying the sensitivity of the visual feedback to differences in bilateral force. In 16 healthy participants, cortical activity was measured using 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) and muscle activity of the flexor pollicis brevis muscle of both hands using 8x8-channel high-density electromyography (HDsEMG). Using the uncontrolled manifold framework, coordination between bilateral forces was quantified by the synergy index RV in the time and frequency domain. Functional connectivity was assed using corticomuscular coherence between muscle activity and cortical source activity and intermuscular coherence between bilateral EMG activity. As expected, bimanual synergies were stronger in the high coordination condition. RV was higher in the high coordination condition in frequencies between 0 and 0.5 Hz, and above 2 Hz. For the 0.5-2 Hz frequency band this pattern was inverted. Corticomuscular coherence in the beta band (16-30 Hz) was maximal in the contralateral motor cortex and was reduced in the high coordination condition. In contrast, intermuscular coherence was observed at 5-12 Hz and increased with bimanual coordination. Within-subject comparisons revealed a negative correlation between RV and corticomuscular coherence and a positive correlation between RV and intermuscular coherence. Our findings suggest two distinct neural pathways: (1) Corticomuscular coherence reflects direct corticospinal projections involved in controlling individual muscles; (2) intermuscular coherence reflects diverging pathways involved in the coordination of multiple muscles.",

This requires that it seeks and destroys the same mutations as selection acting on females, but with higher efficiency, which could happen due to sexual selection-a potent evolutionary force that in most systems predominantly affects males. We used replicate populations of red flour beetles (Tribolium castaneum) to study sex-specific selection against deleterious mutations introduced with ionizing radiation. Additionally, we employed a novel approach to quantify the relative contribution of sexual selection to the overall selection observed in males. The induced mutations were selected against in both sexes, with decreased sexual competitiveness contributing, on average, over 40% of the total decline in male fitness. However, we found no evidence for selection being stronger in males than in females; in fact, we observed a non-significant trend in the opposite direction. These results suggest that selection on males does not reduce mutation load below the level expected under the (hypothetical) scenario of asexual reproduction. Thus, we found no support for the hypothesis that sexual selection contributes to the evolutionary maintenance of sex.",

From a meta-analysis of a large dataset of functional brain imaging experiments, we further found that the thalamus is involved in multiple cognitive functions. Finally, we found that focal thalamic lesions in humans have widespread distal effects, disrupting the modular organization of cortical functional networks. This converging evidence suggests that the human thalamus is a critical hub region that could integrate heteromodal information and maintain the modular structure of cortical functional networks.",

Our analysis of healthy stool metagenomes reveals thousands of genes whose abundance differs signifi-cantly between people consistently across studies, including glycolytic enzymes, lipopolysac-charide biosynthetic genes, and secretion systems. Even housekeeping pathways contain a mix of variable and invariable genes, though most deeply conserved genes are significantly invariable.

To overcome these difficulties, we present here a framework for precise inference of structural alignments, built on the Bayesian and information-theoretic principle of Minimum Message Length (MML). The quality of any alignment is measured by its explanatory power - the amount of lossless compression achieved to explain the protein coordinates using that alignment. We have implemented this approach in the program MMLigner http://lcb.infotech.monash.edu.au/mmligner to distinguish statistically significant alignments, not available elsewhere. We also demonstrate the reliability of MMLigners alignment results compared with the state of the art. Importantly, MMLigner can also discover different structural alignments of comparable quality, a challenging problem for oligomers and protein complexes.",

    "abstract": "Aim The taxon cycle hypothesis describes the cyclic movement of taxa during range expansion and contraction, accompanied by an evolutionary shift from open and often coastal vegetation to closed, and often inland forest vegetation in island systems. The Hawaiian Archipelago is an ideal system to test this hypothesis given the linear fashion of island formation and a relatively well-understood geological history.\\n\\nLocation Hawaiian Islands.\\n\\nMethods We sampled 153 individuals in 15 of the 16 native species of Hawaiian Euphorbia section Anisophyllum on six major Hawaiian Islands, plus 11 New World close relatives, to elucidate the biogeographic movement of this lineage along the Hawaiian island chain. We used a concatenated chloroplast DNA data set of more than eight kilobases in aligned length and applied maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference for phylogenetic reconstruction. Connectivity among islands and habitat types was estimated using BayesTraits. Age and phylogeographic patterns were co-estimated using BEAST. In addition, we used nuclear ribosomal ITS and the low-copy genes LEAFY and G3pdhC to investigate the reticulate relationships within this radiation.\\n\\nResults We estimate that Hawaiian Euphorbia first arrived on Kauai or Niihau ca. 5 million years ago and subsequently diverged into 16 species on all major Hawaiian Islands. During this process Euphorbia dispersed from older to younger islands in a stepping-stone fashion through open, dispersal-prone habitats. Taxa that occupy closed vegetation on Kauai and Oahu evolved in situ from open vegetation taxa of the same island. Consequently, widespread species tend to occupy habitats with open vegetation, whereas single island endemic species predominantly occur in habitats with closed canopy and are only found on the two oldest islands of Kauai and Oahu.\\n\\nMain conclusions The spatial and temporal patterns of dispersal and range shifts in Hawaiian Euphorbia support an intra-volcanic-archipelago version of the taxon cycle hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Anticorrelation between the default network (DN) and dorsal attention network (DAN) is thought to be an intrinsic aspect of functional brain organization reflecting competing functions. However, the stability of anticorrelations across distinct DN subsystems, different contexts, and time, remains unexplored. Here we examine DN-DAN functional connectivity across six different cognitive states. We show that:(i) the DAN is anticorrelated with the DN core subsystem, but not with the two DN subsystems involved in mentalizing and mnemonic functions, respectively; (ii) DN-DAN interactions vary significantly across cognitive states; (iii) DN-DAN connectivity fluctuates across time between periods of anticorrelation and periods of positive correlation; and (iv) coupling between the frontoparietal control network (FPCN) and DAN predicts variation in the strength of DN-DAN anticorrelation across time. These findings reveal substantial variability in DN-DAN interactions, suggesting that these networks are not strictly competitive, and that the FPCN may act to modulate their anticorrelation strength.",

During winter holidays, potential disease-causing contact and travel deviate from typical patterns, and we aim to understand these changes on age-specific and spatial flu transmission.\\n\\nMethodsWe characterized the changes to transmission and epidemic trajectories among children and adults in a spatial context before, during, and after the winter holidays among aggregated physician medical claims in the United States from 2001 to 2009 and among synthetic data simulated from a deterministic, age-specific spatial metapopulation model.\\n\\nResultsWinter holidays reduced flu transmission and delayed the trajectory of flu season epidemics. The holiday period itself observed a shift in relative risk of disease from children towards adults. Model results indicated that holidays delay epidemic peaks and synchronize incidence across locations, and contact reductions from school closures rather than age-specific mixing and travel produce these observed holiday dynamics.\\n\\nConclusionsWinter holidays delay seasonal influenza epidemic peaks due to changes in contact patterns. These findings may improve the future design of influenza intervention strategies, such as the proper timing and duration of school closures, and the spatial and demographic allocation of vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Reprogramming of somatic cells in intact nematodes allows characterization of cell plasticity determinants, which knowledge is crucial for regenerative cell therapies. By inducing muscle or endoderm transdifferentiation by the ectopic expression of selector transcription factors, we show that cell fate is remarkably robust in fully differentiated larvae. This stability depends on the presence of the Polycomb-associated histone H3K27 methylation, but not H3K9 methylation: in the absence of this epigenetic mark, many cells can be transdifferentiated which correlates with definitive developmental arrest. A candidate RNAi screen unexpectedly uncovered that knock-down of somatic NotchLIN-12 signaling rescues this larval arrest. Similarly in a wild-type context, genetically increasing NotchLIN-12 signaling renders a fraction of the animals sensitive to induced transdifferentiation. This reveals an antagonistic role of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 stabilizing cell fate and Notch signaling enhancing cell plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Motor planning is the process of preparing the appropriate motor commands in order to achieve a goal. This process has been largely considered as occurring before movement onset and has been traditionally associated with reaction time. However, in a virtual line bisection task, we observed an overlap between movement planning and execution.\\n\\nIn this task performed with a robotic manipulandum, we observed that the participants (N=30) made straight movements when the line was in front of them (near target) but made often curved movements towards a farther target that was located sideways in such a way that they crossed the line perpendicular to it. Unexpectedly, movements to the far targets had shorter reaction times than movements to the near target (mean difference: 32ms, SE: 5ms, max: 104ms). In addition, the curvature of the movement modulated reaction time. A larger increase in movement curvature from the near to the far target was associated with a larger reduction in reaction time. These highly curved movements started with a transport phase during which accuracy demands were not taken into account.\\n\\nWe concluded that accuracy demand imposes a reaction time penalty if it is processed before movement onset. This penalty is reduced if the start of the movement can consist of a transport phase and if the movement plan can be refined in function of accuracy demands later in the movement, hence demonstrating an overlap between movement planning and execution.\\n\\nNew and NoteworthyIn the planning of a movement, the brain has the opportunity to delay the incorporation of accuracy requirements on the motor plan in order to reduce the reaction time by up to 100ms. Such shortening of reaction time is observed here when the first phase of the movement consists in a transport phase. This forces us to reconsider the idea that motor plans are fully characterized before movement onset.",
