    "abstract": "Blindness has evolved repeatedly in cave-dwelling organisms, and investigating the loss of sight in cave dwellers presents an opportunity to understand the operation of fundamental evolutionary processes, including drift, selection, mutation, and migration. The observation of blind organisms has prompted many hypotheses for their blindness, including both accumulation of neutral, loss-of-function mutations and adaptation to darkness. Here we model the evolution of blindness in caves. This model captures the interaction of three forces: (1) selection favoring alleles causing blindness, (2) immigration of sightedness alleles from a surface population, and (3) loss-of-function mutations creating blindness alleles. We investigated the dynamics of this model and determined selection-strength thresholds that result in blindness evolving in caves despite immigration of sightedness alleles from the surface. Our results indicate that strong selection is required for the evolution of blindness in cave-dwelling organisms, which is consistent with recent work suggesting a high metabolic cost of eye development.",

Here we report the discovery that Eutrema salsugineum has lost gbM from its genome, the first known instance for an angiosperm. Of all known DNA methyltransferases, only CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 (CMT3) is missing from E. salsugineum. Identification of an additional angiosperm, Conringia planisiliqua, which independently lost CMT3 and gbM supports that CMT3 is required for the establishment of gbM. Detailed analyses of gene expression, the histone variant H2A.Z and various histone modifications in E. salsugineum and in Arabidopsis thaliana epiRILs found no evidence in support of any role for gbM in regulating transcription or affecting the composition and modifications of chromatin over evolutionary time scales.",

    "abstract": "We have investigated the ontogeny of light-driven responses in mouse retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Using a large-scale, high-density multielectrode array, we recorded from hundreds to thousands of RGCs simultaneously at pan-retinal level, including dorsal and ventral locations. Responses to different contrasts not only revealed a complex developmental profile for ON, OFF and ON-OFF RGC types, but also unveiled differences between dorsal and ventral RGCs. At eye-opening, dorsal RGCs of all types were more responsive to light, perhaps indicating an environmental priority to nest viewing for pre-weaning pups. The developmental profile of ON and OFF RGCs exhibited antagonistic behavior, with the strongest ON responses shortly after eye-opening, followed by an increase in the strength of OFF responses later on. Further, we found that with maturation receptive field (RF) center sizes decrease, responses to light get stronger, and centers become more circular while seeing differences in all of them between RGC types. These findings show that retinal functionality is not spatially homogeneous, likely reflecting ecological requirements that favour the early development of dorsal retina, and reflecting different roles in vision in the mature animal.",

Measurement of cell-to-cell gene expression similarity is critical to identification, visualization and analysis of cell populations. However, single-cell data introduce challenges to conventional measures of gene expression similarity because of the high level of noise, outliers and dropouts. Here, we propose a novel similarity-learning framework, SIMLR (single-cell interpretation via multi-kernel learning), which learns an appropriate distance metric from the data for dimension reduction, clustering and visualization applications. Benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods for these applications, we used SIMLR to re-analyse seven representative single-cell data sets, including high-throughput droplet-based data sets with tens of thousands of cells. We show that SIMLR greatly improves clustering sensitivity and accuracy, as well as the visualization and interpretability of the data.",

    "abstract": "Background and RationalePost-marital residence patterns refer to where a couple lives after marriage, such as near or with husbands kin (patrilocality) or wifes kin (matrilocality). These patterns influence other aspects of social organization and behavior, and potentially reveal key parts of human nature. Since the 1860s, anthropologists have sought to characterize prehistoric hunter-gatherers post-marital residence patterns by extrapolating from modern hunter-gatherers and chimpanzees behavior. For many reasons, these extrapolations are invalid. I summarized direct evidence of residence patterns from prehistoric hunter-gatherers remains.\\n\\nMethodsI conducted a systematic review of strontium isotope and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) studies of prehistoric hunter-gatherers and extinct hominins. I also carried out a systematic review of the reliability of classifying prehistoric hunter-gatherer individuals by sex. To evaluate assumptions underlying my analyses of residence patterns, I reviewed the ethnographic literature on hunter-gatherers mortuary practices as represented in the eHRAF World Cultures database.\\n\\nResultsThe archaeologic sites included in my review represent every inhabited continent except Australia, and their dates span almost the last 10,000 years. In the strontium isotope studies, most adults of both sexes were local, and women were slightly more likely to be local than men. Within sites, women and men had similar mtDNA distributions. Women in neighboring, contemporaneous communities had somewhat distinct mtDNA distributions from each other, while the mtDNA distributions of men in the different communities were less distinguishable. The statistical uncertainties for most summaries are fairly large. Taken together, the results indicate the burial communities were mostly endogamous and that exogamous marriages strained toward matrilocality. The very limited research on extinct hominins residence patterns is consistent with these findings. In addition, there was only a moderate correspondence between morphologic and genetic estimates of sex in adult prehistoric hunter-gatherer individuals. When I corrected for this measurement error or relied on genetic estimates of sex only, the post-marital residence pattern results shifted in the direction of greater matrilocal tendencies. Modern hunter-gatherers burial practices were consonant with the assumptions underlying my analyses.\\n\\nConclusionsDirect evidence from prehistoric hunter-gatherers remains indicates very different post-marital residence patterns than those extrapolated from modern hunter-gatherers and chimpanzees behavior. In prehistoric hunter-gatherer settings, endogamy may be the outcome of humans long-term mating preferences. Endogamy may have inhibited bacterial sexually transmitted diseases in prehistory and enabled the evolution of altruism in humans.\\n\\nO_QD\\\"There is something fascinating about science.

    "abstract": "Details of the processes that generate biological diversity have long been of interest to evolutionary biologists. A common theme in nature is diversification via divergent selection with gene flow. Empirical studies on this topic find variable genetic differentiation throughout the genome, that genetic differentiation is non-randomly distributed, and that loci of adaptive significance are often found clustered together within \\\"genomic islands of divergence\\\". Theoretical models based on new mutations show how these genomic islands can arise and grow as a result of a complex interaction of various evolutionary and genic processes. In the current study, I ask if such genomic islands can alternatively arise from divergent selection from standing genetic variation and I tested this using a simple two locus model of selection. There are numerous ways in which standing genetic variation can be partitioned (e.g., between alleles, between loci, and between populations) and I tested which of these scenarios can give rise to an island pattern compared to no genomic differentiation or complete genomic differentiation. I found that divergent selection, even without reciprocal gene exchange between populations, following a bout of admixture can relatively quickly produce an island pattern. Moreover, I found two pathways in which islands can form from divergence from standing variation: 1) through the build up of islands and 2) through the breakdown of larger, genome-wide differentiation. Lastly, similar to new mutation theory, I found that the frequency of recombination is an important determinant of island formation from standing genetic variation such that mating behavior of a species (e.g., facultative or obligate sexual) can impact the likelihood of island formation.",

We compared the accuracy of local staging of prostate cancer using 1.5 Tesla MRI with endorectal coil (ERC) versus 3 Tesla MRI with pelvic array coil (PAC) to the gold standard of trans-rectal US guided biopsies (TRUS). ERC is uncomfortable and has many imaging artifacts that may limit detection, so we hypothesize that 3 T MRI with PAC will have improved performance. 72 patients underwent prostate MRIs and TRUS prostate biopsies from 2008-2011 (33 were excluded due to prior radiation therapy, 24 patients underwent 1.5 T ERC and 15 underwent 3.0 T PAC.) 3.0 T PAC was trending towards greater sensitivity although we lack the statistical power for significance.",

Here we present an analytical treatment of the dynamics of the mean number of blocks over time, for continuous and discrete chromosomes, in finite and infinite populations. We describe the mean number of haplotype blocks as a universal function dependent on population size, the number of genomic elements per chromosome, the number of recombination events, and the initial relative frequency of the ancestral species.",

    "abstract": "Silent circulation of polioviruses without poliomyelitis cases could threaten eradication when oral polio vaccine (OPV) use is stopped worldwide. Waning immunity promotes silent circulation by increasing poliovirus transmission from individuals not at risk of paralytic polio. There is limited data on temporal patterns of waning. Accordingly, we modeled a range of waning patterns, scaled from fast but shallow to slow but deep, while keeping constant the effect of waning on transmission dynamics before vaccination begins. Besides waning, we varied overall transmissibility, the delay from beginning vaccination to reaching specified infection levels, and type specific virus characteristics. We observed an increasing range of vaccination levels that resulted in long periods of silent circulation after eliminating paralytic polio cases as the delay in reaching final vaccination levels increased. The extent of silent circulation was higher when waning was slower and deeper, when transmissibility was higher, and when virus was type 3. In our model, modest levels of vaccination of adults reduce silent circulation risks. These modeled patterns are consistent with very long silent circulation mainly emerging as a threat to OPV cessation in the last places from which polio cases are eliminated. Our analyses indicate why previous modeling studies have not seen the threat of silent circulation. They used models with no or very short duration waning and they lacked identifiability of waning effects on silent circulation because they fit models only to paralytic polio case counts. Our analyses show that nearly identical polio case count patterns can be generated by a range of waning patterns that in turn generate diverse silent circulation risks. We conclude that the risks of prolonged silent circulation are real but unquantified, that vaccinating adults with waned immunity will reduce those risks, and that intensive environmental surveillance will be needed to detect this risk before stopping OPV.",

The transition zone (TZ) at the base of the cilium is critical for cilia function, and defects in several TZ proteins are associated with human congenital ciliopathies such as Nephronophthisis (NPHP) and Meckel Gruber syndrome (MKS). In several species, MKS and NPHP proteins form separate complexes that cooperate with Cep290 to assemble the TZ, but flies lack an obvious NPHP complex. We show that MKS proteins in flies are spatially separated from Cep290 at the TZ, and that flies mutant for individual MKS genes fail to recruit other MKS proteins to the TZ, while Cep290 appears to be recruited normally. Although there are abnormalities in microtubule and membrane organisation in developing MKS mutant cilia, these defects are less apparent in adults, where sensory cilia and sperm flagella function quite normally. Thus, surprisingly, MKS proteins are not essential for cilia or flagella function in flies.",

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging studies commonly associate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and posterior parietal cortex with conscious perception. However, such studies only investigate correlation, rather than causation. In addition, many studies conflate objective performance with subjective awareness. In an influential recent paper, Rounis and colleagues addressed these issues by showing that theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (tbs-TMS) applied to the DLPFC impaired metacognitive (subjective) awareness for a perceptual task, while objective performance was kept constant. We attempted to replicate this finding, with minor modifications, including an active tbs-TMS control site. Using a between-subjects design for both DLPFC and posterior parietal cortices, we found no evidence of a tbs-TMS-induced metacognitive impairment. In a second experiment, we devised a highly rigorous within-subjects tbs-TMS design for DLPFC, but again failed to find any evidence of metacognitive impairment. One crucial difference between our results and the Rounis study is our strict exclusion of data deemed unsuitable for a signal detection theory analysis. Indeed, when we included this unstable data, a significant, though invalid, metacognitive impairment was found. These results cast doubt on previous findings relating metacognitive awareness to DLPFC, and inform the current debate concerning whether or not prefrontal regions are preferentially implicated in conscious perception.",

SynGAP is abundant enough in postsynaptic densities (PSDs) to occupy about one third of the PDZ domains of PSD-95.

In Drosophila melanogaster, high-altitude melanism has evolved in separate mountain ranges in sub-Saharan Africa, potentially as an adaptation to UV intensity. We investigated the genetic basis of this melanism in three populations using a new bulk segregant analysis mapping method. Although hundreds of genes are known to affect cuticular pigmentation in D. melanogaster, we identified only 19 distinct QTLs from 9 mapping crosses, with several QTL peaks being shared among two or all populations. Surprisingly, we did not find wide signals of genetic differentiation (Fst) between lightly and darkly pigmented populations at these QTLs, in spite of the pronounced phenotypic difference in pigmentation. Instead, we found small numbers of highly differentiated SNPs at the probable causative genes. A simulation analysis showed that these patterns of polymorphism are consistent with selection on standing genetic variation (leading to \\\"soft sweeps\\\"). Our results thus support a role for oligogenic selection on standing genetic variation in driving parallel ecological adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Identifying the genomic regions that underlie complex phenotypic variation is a key challenge in modern biology. Many approaches to quantitative trait locus mapping in animal and plant species suffer from limited power and genomic resolution. Here, I investigate whether bulk segregant analysis (BSA), which has been successfully applied for yeast, may have utility in the genomic era for trait mapping in Drosophila (and other organisms that can be experimentally bred in similar numbers). I perform simulations to investigate the statistical signal of a quantitative trait locus (QTL) in a wide range of BSA and introgression mapping (IM) experiments. BSA consistently provides more accurate mapping signals than IM (in addition to allowing the mapping of multiple traits from the same experimental population). The performance of BSA and IM is maximized by having multiple independent crosses, more generations of interbreeding, larger numbers of breeding individuals, and greater genotyping effort, but is less affected by the proportion of individuals selected for phenotypic extreme pools. I also introduce a prototype analysis method for Simulation-based Inference for BSA Mapping (SIBSAM). This method identifies significant QTLs and estimates their genomic confidence intervals and relative effect sizes. Importantly, it also tests whether overlapping peaks should be considered as two distinct QTLs. This approach will facilitate improved trait mapping in Drosophila and other species for which hundreds or thousands of offspring (but not millions) can be studied.",

    "abstract": "The centrosome is positioned at the cell center by pushing and pulling forces transmitted by microtubules (MTs). Centrosome decentering is often considered to result from asymmetric, cortical pulling forces exerted in particular by molecular motors on MTs, and controlled by external cues affecting the cell cortex locally. Here we used numerical simulations to investigate the possibility that it could equally result from the redistribution of pushing forces due to a reorientation of MTs. We first showed that MT gliding along cell edges and pivoting around the centrosome regulate MT rearrangement and thereby direct the spatial distribution of pushing forces, while the number, dynamics and stiffness of MTs determine the magnitude of these forces. By modulating these parameters, we identified different regimes, involving both pushing and pulling forces, characterized either by robust centrosome centering, robust off-centering or \\\"reactive\\\" positioning. In those latter conditions weak asymmetric cues can induce a misbalance of pushing and pulling forces resulting in an abrupt transition from a centered to an off-centered position. Altogether these results point at the central role played by the configuration of the MTs on the distribution of pushing forces that position the centrosome. We suggest that asymmetric external cues should not be seen as direct driver of centrosome decentering and cell polarization, but rather as inducers of an effective reorganization of the MT network, fostering centrosome motion to the cell periphery.",

    "abstract": "In mammalian cells, transient gene expression (TGE) is a rapid, minimal-investment alternative to single-copy integrations for testing of transgenic constructs. However, transient gene expression, as measured by flow cytometry with a fluorescent reporter, typically displays a broad, asymmetric distribution with a left-tail that is convolved with background signal. Common approaches for deriving a summary statistic for transiently expressed gene products impose a normal distribution on gated or ungated data. Summary statistics derived from these models are heavily biased by experimental conditions and instrument settings that are difficult to replicate and insufficient to accurately describe the underlying data. Here, we present a convolved gamma distribution as a superior model for TGE datasets. The 4-6 parameters of this model are sufficient to accurately describe the entire, ungated distribution of transiently transfected HEK cells expressing monomeric fluorescent proteins, that operates consistently across a range of transfection conditions and instrument settings. Based on these observations, a convolved gamma model of TGE distributions has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and reproducibility of genetic device characterization in mammalian cells.",

The exploratory motion of the filopodia is crucial for synaptogenesis but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. To study the filopodial motility, we collected and analyzed image data on filopodia in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. We hypothesized that mechanical feedback among the actin retrograde flow, myosin activity and substrate adhesion gives rise to various filopodial behaviors. We have formulated a minimal one-dimensional partial differential equation model that reproduced the range of observed motility. To validate our model, we systematically manipulated experimental correlates of parameters in the model: substrate adhesion strength, actin polymerization rate, myosin contractility and the integrity of the putative microtubule-based barrier at the filopodium base. The model predicts the response of the system to each of these experimental perturbations, supporting the hypothesis that our actomyosin-driven mechanism controls dendritic filopodia dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a range of major neurodevelopmental disabilities with a strong genetic basis. Yet, owing to extensive genetic heterogeneity, multiple modes of inheritance and limited study sizes, sequencing and quantitative genetics approaches have had limited success in characterizing the complex genetics of ASD. Currently, only a small fraction of potentially causal genes--about 65 genes out of an estimated severalhundred--are known based on strong genetic evidence. Hence, there isa critical need for complementary approaches to further characterize the genetic basis of ASD, enabling development of better screening and therapeutics. Here, we use a machine-learning approach based on a human brain-specific functional gene interaction network to present a genome-wide prediction of autism-associated genes, including hundreds of candidate genes for which there is minimal or no prior genetic evidence. Our approach is validated in an independent case-control sequencing study of approximately 2,500families. Leveraging these genome-wide predictions and the brain-specificnetwork, we demonstrate that the large set of ASD genes converges on a smaller number of key cellular pathways and specific developmental stages of the brain. Specifically, integration with spatiotemporal transcriptome expression data implicates early fetal and midfetal stages of the developing human brain in ASD etiology. Likewise, analysis of the connectivity of topautism genes in the brain-specific interaction network reveals the breadthof autism-associated functional modules, processes, and pathways in the brain. Finally, we identify likely pathogenic genes within the most frequent autism-associated copy-number-variants (CNVs) and propose genes and pathways that are likely mediators of autism across multiple CNVs. All the predictions, interactions, and functional insights from this work are available to biomedical researchers at asd.princeton.edu.",

    "abstract": "HIV-1 full-length, unspliced genomic RNAs (gRNAs) serve both as mRNAs encoding the Gag and Gag-Pol capsid proteins as well as the genetic material packaged by Gag into virions that assemble at the plasma membrane (PM). Whether localized Gag synthesis contributes to assembly at the PM is unknown. Here we show that artificially tethering gRNAs or surrogate gag-pol mRNAs to non-PM membranes or the actin cytoskeleton can markedly affect Gags distribution in the cytoplasm, causing aberrant subcellular sites of assembly and severe reductions to virus particle output. Only gag-pol mRNAs competent for translation were capable of altering Gags distribution within the cell, and the activity mapped to two cis-acting RNA regulatory elements; the 5 packaging signal (Psi) bound by Gag and, unexpectedly, the Rev response element (RRE) that regulates the nuclear export of gRNAs and other intron-retaining viral RNAs. Taken together, our results suggest a model wherein localized translation of gRNAs at the PM helps to compartmentalize Gag-gRNA interactions, thereby promoting efficient genome encapsidation.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe spatial distribution of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) within the cytoplasm can be a crucial determinant of gene expression. Here we provide evidence that a devastating viral pathogen, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), exploits localized translation to favor the formation of infectious, transmissible virions at the surface of infected cells. Artificially tethering viral mRNAs encoding the Gag and Gag-Pol capsid proteins (gag-pol mRNAs) to alternative regions of the cell such as cytoplasmic vesicles or the actin cytoskeletion markedly alters Gag subcellular distribution, perturbs sites of assembly, and reduces virus particle production. These and additional findings suggest a model for HIV-1 assembly wherein localized Gag/Gag-Pol translation coupled to confined interactions between Gag and viral genomes ensures infectious virion production at the right place and the right time. Perturbing HIV-1 mRNA subcellular localization could represent a novel antiviral strategy.",

    "abstract": "In plants, fruit maturation and oxidative stress can induce small heat shock protein (sHSP) synthesis to maintain cellular homeostasis. Although the tomato reference genome was published in 2012, the actual number and functionality of sHSP genes remain unknown. Using a transcriptomic (RNA-seq) and evolutionary genomic approach, putative sHSP genes in the Solanum lycopersicum (cv. Heinz 1706) genome are investigated. A sHSP gene family of 33 members is established. Remarkably, roughly half of themembers of this family can be explained by nine independent tandem duplication eventsthat evolutionarily determined their functional fates. Within a mitochondrial class subfamily, only one duplicated member, Solyc08g078700, retained its ancestral chaperonefunction, while the others, Solyc08g078710 and Solyc08g078720,likely degenerated under neutrality and lack ancestral chaperone function. Functional conservation occurred within a cytosolic class I subfamily, whose four members, Solyc06g076570, Solyc06g076560, Solyc06g076540 and Solyc06g076520, support ~57% of the total sHSP RNAm in the red ripe fruit. Sub-functionalization occurred within a new subfamily, whose twomembers, Solyc04g082720 and Solyc04g082740, show heterogeneous differential expressionprofiles during fruit ripening. These findings, involving the birth/death of some genes or the preferential/plastic expression of some others during fruit ripening, highlight the importance of tandem duplication events in the expansion of the sHSP gene family in the tomato genome. Despite its evolutionary diversity, the sHSP gene family in the tomato genome seems to be endowed with a core set of four homeostasis genes: Solyc05g014280, Solyc03g082420, Solyc11g020330 and Solyc06g076560, which appear to provide abaseline protection during both fruit ripening and heat shock stress in different tomato tissues.",

While the impacts of temperature on the physiology of ectotherms have been extensively studied, there are currently no frameworks available that outline the multiple and often simultaneous pathways by which temperature can affect behaviour. Drawing from the literature on insects, we propose a unified framework that should apply to all ectothermic animals, generalizing temperature's behavioural effects into (1) Kinetic effects, resulting from temperature's bottom-up constraining influence on metabolism and neurophysiology over a range of timescales (from short-to long-term), and (2) Integrated effects, where the top-down integration of thermal information intentionally initiates or modifies a behaviour (behavioural thermoregulation, thermal orientation, thermosensory behavioural adjustments). We discuss the difficulty in distinguishing adaptive behavioural changes due to temperature from behavioural changes that are the products of constraints, and propose two complementary approaches to help make this distinction and class behaviours according to our framework: (i) behavioural kinetic null modeling and (ii) behavioural ecology experiments using temperature-insensitive mutants. Our framework should help to guide future research on the complex relationship between temperature and behaviour in ectothermic animals.",

The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project presents an unprecedented opportunity to address this question due to the availability of deep whole genome sequencing (WGS) and multi-tissue RNA-seq data from 147 individuals. We used comprehensive methods to identify 24,157 high confidence SVs, and mapped cis expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in 13 tissues via joint analysis of SVs, single nucleotide (SNV) and short insertion/deletion (indel) variants. We identified 24,801 eQTLs affecting the expression of 10,101 distinct genes. Based on haplotype structure and heritability partitioning, we estimate that SVs are the causal variant at 3.3-7.0% of eQTLs, which is nearly an order of magnitude higher than prior estimates from low coverage WGS and represents a 26- to 54-fold enrichment relative to their scarcity in the genome. Expression-altering SVs also have significantly larger effect sizes than SNVs and indels. We identified 787 putatively causal SVs predicted to directly alter gene expression, most of which (88.3%) are noncoding variants that show significant enrichment at enhancers and other regulatory elements. By evaluating linkage disequilibrium between SVs, SNVs and indels, we nominate 49 SVs as plausible causal variants at published genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci. Remarkably, 29.9% of the common SV-eQTLs are not well tagged by flanking SNVs, and we observe a notable abundance (relative to SNVs and indels) of rare, high impact SVs associated with aberrant expression of nearby genes. These results suggest that comprehensive WGS-based SV analyses will increase the power of both common and rare variant association studies.",
