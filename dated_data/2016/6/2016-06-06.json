    "abstract": "SummaryIn this application note we describe fluff, a software package that allows for simple exploration, clustering and visualization of high-throughput sequencing data mapped to a reference genome. The package contains three command-line tools to generate publication-quality figures in an uncomplicated manner using sensible defaults. Genome-wide data can be aggregated, clustered and visualized in a heatmap, according to different clustering methods. This includes a predefined setting to identify dynamic clusters between different conditions or developmental stages. Alternatively, clustered data can be visualized in a bandplot. Finally, fluff includes a tool to generate genomic profiles. As command-line tools, the fluff programs can easily be integrated into standard analysis pipelines. The installation is straightforward and documentation is available at http://fluff.readthedocs.org.\\n\\nAvailabilityfluff is implemented in Python and runs on Linux. The source code is freely available for download at http://github.com/simonvh/fluff.\\n\\nContacts.vanheeringen@science.ru.nl",

    "abstract": "The olfactory system, like other sensory systems, can detect specific stimuli of interest amidst complex, varying backgrounds. To gain insight into the neural mechanisms underlying this ability, we imaged responses of mouse olfactory bulb glomeruli to single odors and hundreds of mixtures. We used this data to build a model of mixture responses that incorporated nonlinear interactions and trial-to-trial variability and explored potential decoding mechanisms that can mimic mouse performance from our previous study (Rokni et al., 2014) when given glomerular responses as input. We find that a linear decoder with sparse weights could match mouse performance using just a small subset of the glomeruli (~ 15). However, when such a decoder is trained only with single odors, it generalizes poorly to mixture stimuli due to nonlinear mixture responses. We show that mice similarly fail to generalize, although they could in principle fully decompose the mixtures. This suggests that mice learn this segregation task discriminatively by adjusting task-specific decision boundaries without taking advantage of a demixed representation of odors.",

    "abstract": "Improvement of variant calling in next-generation sequence data requires a comprehensive, genome-wide catalogue of high-confidence variants called in a set of genomes for use as a benchmark. We generated deep, whole-genome sequence data of seventeen individuals in a three-generation pedigree and called variants in each genome using a range of currently available algorithms. We used haplotype transmission information to create a phased \\\"platinum\\\" variant catalogue of 4.7 million single nucleotide variants (SNVs) plus 0.7 million small (1-50bp) insertions and deletions (indels) that are consistent with the pattern of inheritance in the parents and eleven children of this pedigree. Platinum genotypes are highly concordant with the current catalogue of the National Institute of Standards and Technology for both SNVs (>99.99%) and indels (99.92%), and add a validated truth catalogue that has 26% more SNVs and 45% more indels. Analysis of 334,652 SNVs that were consistent between informatics pipelines yet inconsistent with haplotype transmission (\\\"non-platinum\\\") revealed that the majority of these variants are de novo and cell-line mutations or reside within previously unidentified duplications and deletions. The reference materials from this study are a resource for objective assessment of the accuracy of variant calls throughout genomes.",

    "abstract": "Sediments are depositional areas where particles sink from water columns, but they are also microbial hotspots that play an important role in biogeochemical cycles. Unfortunately, the importance of both processes in structuring microbial community composition has not been assessed. We surveyed all organismic signals of the last ca. 170 years of sediment by metabarcoding, identifying global trends for eukaryotes, bacteria, archaea, and monitored 40 sediment parameters. We linked the microbial community structure to ongoing and historical environmental parameters and defined three distinct sediment horizons. This not only expands our knowledge of freshwater sediments, but also has profound implications for understanding the microbial community structure and function of sediment communities in relation to future, present, and past environmental changes.",

    "abstract": "Background and RationalePost-marital residence patterns refer to where a couple lives after marriage, such as near or with husbands kin (patrilocality) or wifes kin (matrilocality). These patterns influence other aspects of social organization and behavior, and potentially reveal key parts of human nature. Since the 1860s, anthropologists have sought to characterize prehistoric hunter-gatherers post-marital residence patterns by extrapolating from modern hunter-gatherers and chimpanzees behavior. For many reasons, these extrapolations are invalid. I summarized direct evidence of residence patterns from prehistoric hunter-gatherers remains.\\n\\nMethodsI conducted a systematic review of strontium isotope and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) studies of prehistoric hunter-gatherers and extinct hominins. I also carried out a systematic review of the reliability of classifying prehistoric hunter-gatherer individuals by sex. To evaluate assumptions underlying my analyses of residence patterns, I reviewed the ethnographic literature on hunter-gatherers mortuary practices as represented in the eHRAF World Cultures database.\\n\\nResultsThe archaeologic sites included in my review represent every inhabited continent except Australia, and their dates span almost the last 10,000 years. In the strontium isotope studies, most adults of both sexes were local, and women were slightly more likely to be local than men. Within sites, women and men had similar mtDNA distributions. Women in neighboring, contemporaneous communities had somewhat distinct mtDNA distributions from each other, while the mtDNA distributions of men in the different communities were less distinguishable. The statistical uncertainties for most summaries are fairly large. Taken together, the results indicate the burial communities were mostly endogamous and that exogamous marriages strained toward matrilocality. The very limited research on extinct hominins residence patterns is consistent with these findings. In addition, there was only a moderate correspondence between morphologic and genetic estimates of sex in adult prehistoric hunter-gatherer individuals. When I corrected for this measurement error or relied on genetic estimates of sex only, the post-marital residence pattern results shifted in the direction of greater matrilocal tendencies. Modern hunter-gatherers burial practices were consonant with the assumptions underlying my analyses.\\n\\nConclusionsDirect evidence from prehistoric hunter-gatherers remains indicates very different post-marital residence patterns than those extrapolated from modern hunter-gatherers and chimpanzees behavior. In prehistoric hunter-gatherer settings, endogamy may be the outcome of humans long-term mating preferences. Endogamy may have inhibited bacterial sexually transmitted diseases in prehistory and enabled the evolution of altruism in humans.\\n\\nO_QD\\\"There is something fascinating about science.

Lepbase is a Tier 2 genomic resource for the Lepidoptera, supporting a research community using genomic approaches to understand evolution, speciation, olfaction, behaviour and pesticide resistance in a wide range of target species. Lepbase offers a core set of tools to make genomic data widely accessible including an Ensembl genome browser, text and sequence homology searches and bulk downloads of consistently presented and formatted datasets.

    "abstract": "Gossypium barbadense L. (Egyptian and Pima) produces single celled fiber trichomes that are the longest and richest in cellulosic contents in the plant kingdom. Developmental dissection of fiber at the transcriptional level is crucial to unveiling the genetic mechanisms underpinning fiber morphogenesis. We profiled the transcriptome of developing Pima fibers, as well as genes associated with consensus fiber quality QTLs, at seven developmental time points covering both primary (PCW) and secondary (SCW) cell wall stages. A total of 2,934 genes were differentially expressed at only one (45.19%) or at multiple (54.81%) developmental time points. Based on the coincidence between gene expression dynamics and the time frame of fiber developmental stages, five stage-specific expression profiles were identified. As a link between fiber QTLs and gene expression, 5 potential developmentally regulated QTLs (drQTLs) corresponding to different fiber developmental stages were identified. Genes in the ubiquitin proteolytic pathway, particularly QTL associated genes, appeared to be involved in regulating the transition stage between PCW and SCW; a stage that is crucial to both fiber length and strength in the extra-long staple cotton genotypes. In this respect, Yeast-two-hybrids identified interactions between UBC9 and genes involved in cell and organ elongation, polar cell expansion, microtubule cytoskeleton dynamics and organization, and basic amino acids transportation during the SCW/SCW transition. Altogether, these results were integrated into a proposed model linking fiber developmental stages with the Pima fiber traits.",
