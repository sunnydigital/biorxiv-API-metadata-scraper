    "abstract": "The case-control association study is a powerful method for identifying genetic variants that influence disease risk. However, the collection of cases can be time-consuming and expensive; if a disease occurs late in life or is rapidly lethal, it may be more practical to identify family members of cases. Here, we show that replacing cases with their first-degree relatives enables genome-wide association studies by proxy (GWAX). In randomly-ascertained cohorts, this approach enables previously infeasible studies of diseases that are absent (or nearly absent) in the cohort. As an illustration, we performed GWAX of 12 common diseases in 116,196 individuals from the UK Biobank. By combining these results with published GWAS summary statistics in a meta-analysis, we replicated established risk loci and identified 17 newly associated risk loci: four in Alzheimers disease, eight in coronary artery disease, and five in type 2 diabetes. In addition to informing disease biology, our results demonstrate the utility of association mapping using family history of disease as a phenotype to be mapped. We anticipate that this approach will prove useful in future genetic studies of complex traits in large population cohorts.",

    "abstract": "Understanding why some exotic species become widespread and abundant in their colonized range is a fundamental issue that still needs to be addressed. Among many hypotheses, newly established host populations may benefit from a parasite loss (\\\"enemy release\\\" hypothesis) through impoverishment of their original parasite communities or reduced infection levels. Moreover, the fitness of competing native hosts may be affected by the acquisition of exotic taxa from invaders (\\\"parasite spillover\\\") and/or by an increased transmission risk of native parasites due to their amplification by invaders (\\\"parasite spillback\\\"). We focused on gastrointestinal helminth communities to determine whether these predictions could explain the ongoing invasion success of the commensal house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus) and black rat (Rattus rattus), as well as the associated drop of native Mastomys species, in Senegal. For both invasive species, our results were consistent with the predictions of the enemy release hypothesis. A decrease of helminth overall prevalence and individual species richness was observed along the invasion gradients as well as lower specific prevalence/abundance (Aspiculuris tetraptera in M. m. domesticus, Hymenolepis diminuta in R. rattus) on the invasion fronts. Conversely, we did not find strong evidence of helminth spill-over or spill-back in invasion fronts, where native and invasive rodents co-occurred. Further experimental research is needed to determine whether and how the loss of helminths and reduced infection levels along invasion routes may result in any advantageous effects on invader fitness and competitive advantage.",

    "abstract": "Background.The explosive growth of microbiome research has yielded great quantities of data. These data provide us with many answers, but raise just as many questions. 16S rDNA--the backbone of microbiome analyses--allows us to assess -diversity, {beta}-diversity, and microbe-microbe associations, which characterize the overall properties of an ecosystem. However, we are still unable to use 16S rDNA data to directly assess the microbe-microbe and microbe-environment interactions that determine that system's broader ecology. Thus, properties such as competition, cooperation, and nutrient conditions remain insufficiently analyzed. Here, we apply predictive community metabolic models of microbes identified with 16S rDNA data to probe the ecology of microbial communities.\\n\\nResults.We developed a methodology for the large-scale assessment of microbial metabolic interactions (MMinte)from 16S rDNA data. MMinte assesses the relative growth rates of interacting pairs of organisms within a community metabolic network and whether that interaction has a positive or negative effect. Moreover, MMinte's simulations take into account the nutritional environment, which play a strong role in determining the metabolism of individual microbes. We present two case studies that demonstrate this software's utility. In the first, we show how diet influences the nature of the microbe-microbe interactions. In the second, we use MMinte's modular feature set to better understand how the growth of Desulfovibrio piger is affected by, and affects the growth of, other members in a simplified gut community under metabolic conditions suggested to be determinant for their dynamics.\\n\\nConclusion.By applying metabolic models to commonly available sequence data, MMinte grants the user insight into the metabolic relationships between microbes, highlighting important features that may relate to ecological stability, susceptibility, and cross-feeding. These relationships are at the foundation of a wide range of ecological questions that impact our ability to understand problems such as microbially-derived toxicity in colon cancer.",

    "abstract": "The adaptive immune system utilizes multiple mechanisms linked to innate immune cell functions to respond appropriately to pathogens and commensals. Here we discover further aspects of this connectivity by demonstrating that naive T cells as they emerge from the thymus (recent thymic emigrants, RTEs) express complement receptors (CR1 and CR2), the bacterial pathogen recognition receptor TLR1 and an enzyme that deactivates bacterial lipopolysaccharide (AOAH) and following activation secrete the anti-microbial cytokine IL-8. CR2+ naive T cells also express a selection of genes associated with tissue migration, consistent with the hypothesis that following emigration from the thymus RTEs seed peripheral compartments where some pursue their anti-microbial potential by becoming IL-8-producing CR2+ memory cells while others undergo homeostatic expansion. CR2+ naive and memory cells are abundant in children but decrease with age, coinciding with the involution of the thymus. The ability of CR2, which is also a receptor for Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), to identify recent thymic emigrants will facilitate assessment of thymic function during aging and aid investigations of multiple clinical areas including the occurrence of T cell lymphomas caused by EBV.",

    "abstract": "Evolve and resequence experiments have provided us a tool to understand bacterial adaptation to antibiotics by the gain of genomic mutations. In our previous work, we used short term evolution to isolate mutants resistant to the ribosome targeting antibiotic kanamycin. We had reported gain of resistance to kanamycin via multiple different point mutations in the translation elongation factor G (EF-G). Furthermore, we had shown that the resistance of EF-G mutants could be increased by second site mutations in the genes rpoD / cpxA / topA / cyaA. Mutations in three of these genes had been discovered in earlier screens for aminoglycoside resistance. In this work we expand on our understanding of these second site mutations. Using genetic tools we asked how mutations in the cell envelope stress sensor kinase (CpxAF218Y) and adenylate cyclase (CyaAN600Y) could alter their activities to result in resistance. We found that the mutation in cpxA most likely results in an active Cpx stress response. Further evolution of an EF-G mutant in a higher concentration of kanamycin than what was used in our previous experiments identified the cpxA locus as a primary target for a significant increase in resistance. The mutation in cyaA results in a loss of catalytic activity and probably results in resistance via altered CRP function. Despite a reduction in cAMP levels, the CyaAN600Y mutant has a transcriptome indicative of increased CRP activity, pointing to an unknown non-catalytic role for CyaA in gene expression. From the transcriptomes of double and single mutants we describe the epistasis between the mutation in EF-G and these second site mutations. We show that the large scale transcriptomic changes in the topoisomerase I (FusAA608E-TopAS180L) mutant likely result from increased negative supercoiling in the cell. Finally, genes with known roles in aminoglycoside resistance were present among the mis-regulated genes in the mutants.",

Previous reports showed that at a large scale there is smooth tonotopy in mouse auditory cortex, while at the single neuron level the representation is the traditional \\\"salt and pepper\\\" configuration attributed to rodent cortex. Here we show that at the micro columnar scale we find a large variety of response profiles, but neurons tend to share similar preference in terms of frequency, bandwidth and latency. However, this smooth representation was fractured and large differences were possible between neighbouring neurons. Despite the tendency of most groups of neurons to operate redundantly, high information gains were achieved between cells that had a high signal correlation. Connectivity between neurons was highly non-random, in agreement with a previous in-vitro report from layer five. Our results suggest the existence of functional clusters, connecting neighbouring mini-columns. This supports the idea of a \\\"salt and pepper\\\" configuration at the level of functional clusters of neurons rather than single units.",

Modeling of phenotypes for multi-locus genotype classes in the epistatic networks is often improved by accounting for the interactions.

    "abstract": "It is widely known that the sensitivity analysis plays a major role in computing the strength of the influence of involved factors in any phenomena under investigation. When applied to expression profiles of various intra/extracellular factors that form an integral part of a signaling pathway, the variance and density based analysis yields a range of sensitivity indices for individual as well as various combinations of factors. These combinations denote the higher order interactions among the involved factors that might be of interest in the working mechanism of the pathway. For example, in a range of fourth order combinations among the various factors of the Wnt pathway, it would be easy to assess the influence of the destruction complex formed by APC, AXIN, CSKI and GSK3 interaction. In this work, after estimating the individual effects of factors for a higher order combination, the individual indices are considered as discriminative features. A combination, then is a multivariate feature set in higher order (>2). With an excessively large number of factors involved in the pathway, it is difficult to search for important combinations in a wide search space over different orders. Exploiting the analogy of prioritizing webpages using ranking algorithms, for a particular order, a full set of combinations of interactions can then be prioritized based on these features using a powerful ranking algorithm via support vectors. The computational ranking sheds light on unexplored combinations that can further be investigated using hypothesis testing based on wet lab experiments. Here, the basic framework and results obtained on 2nd and 3rd order interactions on a toy example data set is presented. Subsequent manuscripts will examine higher order interactions in detail. Part B of this work deals with the time series data.",

While it is known that ciliary targeting signals (CTSs) specifically target ciliary proteins to cilia, it is still unclear how CTSs facilitate the entry and retention of ciliary residents at the molecular level. We found that non-ciliary membrane reporters can passively diffuse to cilia via the lateral transport pathway and the translocation of membrane reporters through the ciliary diffusion barrier is facilitated by importin binding motifs/domains. Screening known CTSs of ciliary membrane residents uncovered that fibrocystin, photoreceptor retinol dehydrogenase, rhodopsin and retinitis pigmentosa 2 interact with transportin1 (TNPO1) via previously identified CTSs. We further discovered that a novel ternary complex, comprising TNPO1, Rab8 and CTS, can assemble or disassemble under the guanine nucleotide exchange of Rab8. Our study suggests a novel mechanism in which TNPO1/Rab8/CTS complex mediates selective entry and retention of cargos within cilia.",

We use a physiologically grounded, unsupervised spiking neural network model of the auditory brain with STDP learning to demonstrate that plastic auditory cortex is unable to learn even simple auditory object categories when exposed to the raw AN firing input without subcortical preprocessing. We then demonstrate the importance of non-plastic subcortical preprocessing within the cochlear nucleus (CN) and the inferior colliculus (IC) for stabilising and denoising AN responses. Such preprocessing enables the plastic auditory cortex to learn efficient robust representations of the auditory object categories.
