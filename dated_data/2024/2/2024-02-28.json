    "abstract": "Conventional modeling of the Blood-Oxygen-Level-Dependent (BOLD) signal in resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rsfMRI) struggle with parameter estimation due to the complexity of brain dynamics. This study introduces a novel brain dynamics model (BDM) that directly captures BOLD signal variations through differential equations. Unlike dynamic causal models or neural mass models, we integrate hemodynamic responses into the signal dynamics, considering both direct and network-mediated neuronal activity effects. We utilize Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to estimate the parameters of this BDM, leveraging their ability to embed physical laws into the learning process. This approach simplifies computational demands and increases robustness against data noise, providing a comprehensive tool for analyzing rsfMRI data. Leveraging the functional connectivity matrices scaled by the estimated parameters, we apply a state-of-the-art community detection method to elucidate the network structure. Our analysis reveals significant differences in the participation coefficients of specific brain regions when comparing neurotypical individuals to those with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), with distinct patterns observed between male and female cohorts. These differences are consistent with regions implicated in previous studies, reinforcing the role of these areas in ASD. By integrating PINNs with advanced network analysis, we demonstrate a robust approach for dissecting the complex neural signatures of ASD, providing a promising direction for future research in neuroimaging and the broader field of computational neuroscience.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the complex interplay between gene expression and neuronal activity is crucial for unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying cognitive function and neurological disorders. In this study, we develop pooled screens for neuronal activity, using CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and the fluorescent calcium integrator CaMPARI2. Using this screening method, we identified 153 genes associated that changed synaptic excitability in human iPSC-derived neurons, revealing potential links to neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders. These genes include known regulators of neuronal excitability, such as TARPs and ion channels, as well as genes associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Alzheimers disease (AD) not previously described to affect neuronal excitability. This CRISPRi-based screening platform offers a versatile tool to uncover molecular mechanisms controlling neuronal activity in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWDifferentiation of multipotential progenitor cells is a key process in the development of any multi-cellular organism and often continues throughout its life. It is often assumed that a bi-potential progenitor develops along a (relatively) straight trajectory until it reaches a decision point where the trajectory bifurcates. At this point one of two directions is chosen, each direction representing the unfolding of a new transcriptomic programme. However, we have lacked quantitative means for testing this model. Accordingly, we have developed the R package TrajectoryGeometry. Applying this to published data we find several examples where, rather than bifurcate, developmental pathways branch. That is, the bipotential progenitor develops along a relatively straight trajectory leading to one of its potential fates. A second relatively straight trajectory branches off from this towards the other potential fate. In this sense only cells that branch off to follow the second trajectory make a \"decision\". Our methods give precise descriptions of the genes and cellular pathways involved in these trajectories. We speculate that branching may be the more common behaviour and may have advantages from a control-theoretic viewpoint.",

    "abstract": "Analysis cell types origin of cell-free RNA can enhance the resolution of liquid biopsies, thereby deepening the understanding of molecular and cellular changes in development and disease processes. Existing deconvolution methods typically rely on meticulously curated gene expression profiles or employ deep neural network with vast and complex solution spaces that are difficult to interpret. These approaches fail to leverage the synergistic and co-expression effects among genes in biological signaling pathways, compromising their generalizability and robustness. To address this issue, we have developed  Deconformer, a Transformer-based deconvolution model that integrates biological signaling pathways at the embedding stage. Compared to popular methods on multiple datasets, Deconformer demonstrates superior performance and robustness, and is capable of tracking the developmental process of the placenta. Additionally, Deconformers self-attention mechanism has identified a connection between platelet activation, dependencies with other pathways, and the severity of COVID-19. We believe that Deconformer will enable and accelerate the precise analysis of a wide range of cell-free RNA, describing disease progression and severity from the perspectives of originating cell fractions and pathway dependencies.",

    "abstract": "An organisms oxygen supply capacity () can be measured as a ratio of the metabolic rate (MR) and the critical oxygen partial pressure (Pc). However, this metric is sensitive to errors in the measurement of PO2, especially at low PO2 where the ratio of instrument error to environmental oxygen is magnified. Consequently, the oxygen supply capacity of animals, particularly those that evolved in low-oxygen environments, may appear unnaturally high and variable. Here, we present a method to correct for instrumental calibration error and use simulated and literature datasets to demonstrate how it can be used post hoc to diagnose error in, correct the magnitude of, and reduce the variability in repeat measures of the oxygen supply capacity.",
