    "abstract": "Although urbanization poses various threats to avifauna, some bird species, including Mallards, are attracted to towns and cities as their winter habitats due to favourable temperatures and abundant anthropogenic food. In this study, we investigated how population dynamics changed in relation to winter harshness and intensity of supplementary feeding. The results indicated that the number of Mallards increased with the feeding intensity but the pattern differed in response to worsening of wintering conditions on water bodies with distinct supplementary feeding intensity. The ponds with low feeding intensity were occupied by fewer but more stable populations, suggesting the presence of natural food resources there, available for small number of individuals, regardless of winter conditions. On the ponds with medium feeding intensity, we observed a bell-shaped relationship between the number of ducks and ice cover. Unpredictable anthropogenic food on those ponds might not provide sufficient food resources, forcing birds to relocate when wintering conditions worsen. In such conditions, the ponds with a high feeding intensity attracted more ducks. We demonstrated that the wintering population of Mallards in urban areas is not solely influenced by ambient temperature but is also significantly affected by the intensity of supplementary feeding.",

    "abstract": "Key innovations play a central role in the diversification of lineages, yet our understanding of the mechanisms underlying their emergence remains fragmented. The propelling fan is a key innovation associated with the diversification of Rhagovelia water striders into fast flowing streams. Here, we show that a single giant cell is responsible for the development of the fan throughout embryogenesis. RNA interference against the fan-specific gene family gsha/mogsha depleted the fan in the embryo but did not alter the giant cell, indicating that these genes are not required for specifying the identity of this cell. gsha/mogsha instead seem to activate the expression of cuticular genes during early development, suggesting a role of these genes in regulating the accumulation of fan structural proteins. We also show that Hox genes act to block the giant cell in the fore- and rear-legs, thus restricting its fate to the mid-legs - the pair of legs that generates movement on water. In addition, Hox expression is specifically excluded from the giant cell, thus allowing the expression of the fans developmental genetic program. This study reveals that a single cell can be sufficient to generate innovative traits that have been central for a lineage to acquire new ecological opportunities and burst into diversification.\n\nOne-sentence summaryA single giant cell orchestrates the developmental genetic program of a key innovation",

Biochemical approaches like protein design and evolution are typically used to try and overcome these limitations, but suffer from the large number of possible proteins and mutations in the various GEVI families. Here we approach this problem in a physical way and report that plasmonic coupling to nanoparticles manipulates and enhances the photodynamics and fluorescence of GEVIs in live cells. We designed an optimal nanostar shape for plasmonic coupling through Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) computational models. We synthesized and characterized the resulting particles and quantified their influence on the brightness, voltage sensitivity, and response speed of the GEVI QuasAr6a. We incorporated the plasmonic enhancement into Markov chain photocycle models of Quasar6a, showing manipulation of both the light-dependent state transitions in the protein and of excited state fluorescence and paving the way for plasmonically enhanced voltage imaging.",

    "abstract": "G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) constitute the largest family of signalling proteins responsible for translating extracellular stimuli into intracellular functions. When dysregulated, GPCRs drive numerous diseases and are the most targeted proteins in drug discovery. GPCR structural dynamics and activity can be modulated by a wide range of drugs, including full/partial agonists and antagonists. While crucial for developing novel therapeutics targeting GPCRs, the structural dynamics of the receptors associated with their activity upon drug interactions are not yet fully understood. Here, we employ Hydrogen Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS), to characterise the structural dynamics of turkey {beta}1-adrenergic receptor (t{beta}1AR) in complex with nine ligands, including agonists, partial agonists and antagonists. We show that dynamic signatures across the GPCR structure can be grouped by compound modality. Surprisingly, we discovered repeated destabilisation of the intracellular loop 1 (ICL1) upon full agonist binding and stabilisation upon antagonist binding, suggesting that increased dynamics in this region are an essential component for G-protein recruitment. Multiple sequence alignments and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that L72 in ICL1 plays important structural role. Differential HDX-MS experiment of t{beta}1AR and t{beta}1AR L72A construct in complex with miniGs, in response to various ligands, suggests involvement of ICL1 in stabilising the GDP bound state by influencing the stability of HG helix of miniGs. Overall, our results provide a platform for determining drug modality and highlight how HDX-MS can be used to dissect receptor ligand interaction properties and GPCR mechanism.\n\nSignificance statementRecent advances in hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry have allowed probing conformational signatures of challenging membrane protein assemblies. We studied the structural dynamics of a class A GPCR, namely t{beta}1AR, in response to diverse ligands including agonists, antagonists and partial agonists. We demonstrate that the functional effect of compounds can be discerned by simply profiling the dynamics induced across the receptor, without the need for downstream interaction partners. We showed that ICL1 undergoes a significant change in dynamics between activated and inhibited states consistent with a role in downstream signaling pathways in class A GPCRs.",

    "abstract": "Xanthomonas fragariae (Xaf) usually causes angular leaf spot (ALS) in strawberry all over the world. Recently, we isolated a new strain of Xaf called Xaf YL19. This strain causes not only typical ALS symptoms, but also dry cavity rot in the crown tissues of strawberries. This was the first time a Xaf strain had both of these effects in strawberries. Pathogen effectors play a crucial role in plant colonization and infection. Understanding how effector proteins escape from plant surveillance is important for plant breeding and resistance deployment. In this study, thirty-three putative effectors were predicted in Xaf YL19, and a virulent secreted effector called XopK was identified. XopK has a robust capacity for suppressing plant cell death and transcript response to infection host. Transgenic strawberries expressing XopK exhibit more susceptibility to Xaf YL19, and this was associated with weakened stomatal immunity. Additionally abscisic acid (ABA) accumulation and signaling were mainly suppressed in the presence of XopK. XopK also inhibited ABA- and methyl jasmonate (MeJA)-induced stomatal closure, and ABA- but not MeJA-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Moreover, endogenous ABA is critical for Xaf-induced ROS burst and stomatal closure. These results suggested that Xaf YL19 uses XopK to suppress JA, especially ABA signaling, for disrupting stomatal closure, and allowing its colonization for disease development. Taken together, our results provide a novel virulent mechanism by Xaf and an available strategy for resistant breeding in strawberries.",

    "abstract": "The human immune system is the key line of defense in the body against infections and disease and is critical for our survival. However, immune malfunction or misrecognition of healthy cells and tissue, termed autoimmune disease, is implicated in more than 80 disease conditions and multiple other secondary pathologies. While pan-immunosuppressive therapies like steroids offer some relief for systemic inflammation for some organs, many patients never achieve remission and such drugs do not cross the blood-brain barrier making them ineffective for tackling neuroinflammation. Especially in the brain, unintended activation of microglia and astrocytes is hypothesized to be directly or indirectly responsible for several neurodegenerative diseases including Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Parkinsons Disease (PD), and Alzheimers Disease (AD). Recent studies have also shown that targeting inflammasome and specific immune targets can be beneficial for a range of neurodegenerative diseases. Further, our previous studies have shown targeting NF-{kappa}B and NLRP3 through brain penetrant Nanoligomer cocktail SB_NI_112 (abbreviated to NI112) can be therapeutic for several neurodegenerative diseases. Here we show safety-toxicity studies, followed by pharmacokinetics (PK) and biodistribution in small-(mice) and large-animal (dog) studies of this inflammasome-targeting Nanoligomer cocktail NI 112 which downregulates NF-{kappa}B and NLRP3. We conducted studies using four different routes of administration: intravenous (IV), subcutaneous (SQ), intraperitoneal (IP), and intranasal (IN), and identified the drug concentration over time using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in the blood serum, the brain (including different brain regions), and other target organs like liver, kidney, and colon. Our results indicate the Nanoligomer cocktail has a strong safety profile, has a consistent peak concentration in blood serum, and shows high biodistribution (F) and delivery across all routes of administration. Further analysis of multiexponential serum concentration with time shows while the bound/unbound ratio is highly dependent on the route of administration, species (dog/mice), and dosage, the bound serum to Nanoligomer concentration in the brain is consistent at [~]30%. Moreover, different dosing in dogs through IV and SQ routes also show predictability in bound serum concentration, and constant ratio when comparing large- and small-animal data (dog and mice). We hypothesize the constant ratio is determined by target protein amount, and PK parameters such as area under the curve (AUC) and can be used for more accurate interspecies scaling/dose determination. These results provide an excellent platform for translating and predicting therapeutic dosage between routes of administration in the same species, and a good prediction of scaling between species to attain similar target inhibition using high affinity and specificity of Nanoligomer binding the target.",

    "abstract": "Proper spatiotemporal distribution of the phytohormone auxin throughout plant tissues mediates a variety of developmental processes. Auxin levels are tightly regulated via de novo synthesis, transport, and conversion from its conjugated forms and precursors. These levels can be regulated through conversion of the auxin precursor, indole 3-butyric acid (IBA), into the active auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), in a peroxisomal {beta}-oxidation process. Defects in IBA-to-IAA conversion cause multiple developmental defects in Arabidopsis, demonstrating IBA-derived IAA is physiologically important to the active auxin pool. Similar to IAA, transport of IBA modulates development. However, the mechanisms governing transport of this molecule remain largely unknown. Here, we identify a mutation in the ABCC10 gene of Arabidopsis that suppresses the abcg36 hypersensitivity to IBA and its synthetic analog, 2,4-dichlorophenoxy butyric acid (2,4-DB) and the abcg36 hyperaccumulation of [3H]-IBA. We found that ABCC10 acts as a direct vacuolar transporter of IBA. Further, ABCC10 is necessary for proper development of the root apical meristem and leaf tissue. Our findings uncover a previously uncharacterized method of IBA transport that regulates aspects of plant development.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to elucidate the white matter changes associated with lexical production (LP) difficulties that typically emerge in middle age, resulting in increased naming latencies. To delay the onset of LP decline, middle-aged adults may rely on domain-general (DG) and language-specific (LS) compensatory mechanisms as proposed by the LARA model (Lexical Access and Retrieval in Aging). However, our knowledge of the white matter changes supporting these mechanisms remains incomplete. Based on a sample of 155 middle-aged adults from the CAMCAN cohort, we combined dimensionality reduction techniques with multivariate statistical methods to jointly examine the relationships between diffusion-weighted imaging and LP-related neuropsychological data. Our findings (i) show that midlife constitutes a pivotal period marked by a discontinuity in brain structure within distributed networks within dorsal, ventral, and anterior cortico-subcortical pathways, and (ii) reveal that this discontinuity signals a neurocognitive transition around age 53-54, marking the onset of LP decline. Indeed, our results propose that middle-aged adults may initially adopt a \"semantic strategy\" to compensate for initial LP challenges. Still, this strategy may be compromised when late middle-aged adults (age 55-60) lose the ability to exert cognitive control over semantic representations (i.e., reduced semantic control).\n\nIn summary, our study advances our comprehension of brain structure changes that underpin the neurocognitive profile of LP in middle age. Specifically, we underscore the importance of considering the interplay between DG and LS processes when studying the trajectory of LP performance in healthy aging. Furthermore, these findings offer valuable insights into identifying predictive biomarkers related to the compensatory dynamics observed in midlife, which can help understand language-related neurodegenerative pathologies.\n\nHighlightsO_LIMidlife constitutes a pivotal period characterized by a discontinuity in brain structure.\nC_LIO_LIEarly middle-aged adults (age 45-55) adopt a \"semantic strategy\" to facilitate semantic access and sustain lexical production (LP) performances.\nC_LIO_LILate middle-aged adults (age 55-60) gradually lose the ability to exert cognitive control over semantic representations, marking the onset of LP decline.\nC_LI\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=105 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/579645v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (28K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@85346dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13515b7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@24a1fforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1078f4c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, resulting in an irreversible deterioration of multiple brain regions associated with cognitive dysfunction. Phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein, Tau, is known to occur decades before symptomatic AD. The Src family of tyrosine kinases are known to phosphorylate select tyrosine sites on Tau and promote microtubule disassembly and subsequent neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) formation. Our data show that the proto-oncogene, non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src colocalizes with a range of late (PHF1) to early (MC1) AD-associated phosphorylated Tau epitopes. The strongest co-occurrence is seen with MC1 (probability of MC1 given Src =100%), an early AD-specific conformational dependent epitope. Single-cell RNA sequencing data of 101 subjects show that Src is upregulated in both AD inhibitory and excitatory neurons. The most significantly affected, by orders of magnitude, were excitatory neurons which are the most prone to pathological Tau accumulation. We measured Src phosphorylation by mass spectrometry across a cohort of 48 patient neocortical tissues and found that Src has increased phosphorylation on Ser75, Tyr187, and Tyr440 in AD, showing that Src kinase undergoes distinct phosphorylation alterations in AD. Through Brownian dynamics simulations of Src and Tau, we show that as Tau undergoes the transition into disease-associated paired helical filaments, there is a notable seven-fold increase in Src contact with Tau. These results collectively emphasize Src kinases central role in Tau phosphorylation and its close association with Tau epitopes, presenting a promising target for potential therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPreterm white matter injury (PWMI) is the most common cause of brain injury in premature neonates. PWMI involves a differentiation arrest of oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the central nervous system. Clemastine was previously shown to induce oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination in mouse models of PWMI at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day. The minimum effective dose (MED) of clemastine is unknown. Identification if the MED is essential for maximizing safety and efficacy in neonatal clinical trials. We hypothesized that the MED in neonatal mice is lower than 10 mg/kg/day.\n\nMethodsMouse pups were exposed to normoxia or hypoxia (10% FiO2) from postnatal day 3 (P3) through P10. Vehicle or clemastine fumarate at one of four doses (0.5, 2, 7.5 or 10 mg/kg/day) was given orally to hypoxia-exposed pups.

    "abstract": "BackgroundFollowing cardiac injury, whether the heart is permanently damaged or regenerating, distal organs are subjected to changes in physiological function. It remains largely unknown whether a cardiac lesion can affect gametes and transmit heritable changes to subsequent generations. Here, we report the influence of paternal cardiac injury on the following generation.\n\nMethodsWe studied the intergenerational influence of neonatal cardiac injury in the mouse, an animal model capable of regenerating the heart after early life injury. Neonatal male mice were subjected to ventricular cryoinjury, crossed at adulthood, and their sires were compared with litters derived from uninjured male mice. We used echocardiography, histology, and single nuclei RNA-sequencing to thoroughly characterize cardiac morphology, composition, function, and response to cardiac insult.\n\nResultsWe show that paternal cardiac injury affects the heart morphology of offspring under physiological conditions. Furthermore, in response to the same injury, the F1 generation derived from injured fathers shows better systemic and cardiac recovery, with non-pathological left ventricular enlargement and improved cardiac function during the regenerative process. This is accompanied by the activation of the immune system healing program at 3 weeks post-injury, together with enhanced transcription of genes associated with physiological hypertrophy.\n\nConclusionsThe memory of a paternal neonatal lesion can be transmitted to offspring and improve their recovery from a cardiac insult.",

    "abstract": "All animals must locate and identify food for their survival. Most insects are solitary. Newly emerged solitary insects must therefore employ innate identification of food cues to locate relevant nutritive objects from a distance. Innate preferences for food cues should be both specific enough to allow discrimination between food and non-food objects and general enough to allow for the variety of food objects relevant to each species ecology. How insects with small nervous systems are able to encode these cues innately is an area of intense study for ecologists and neuroscientists alike. Here, we used the solitary generalist pollinator Eristalinus aeneus to understand how the innate search template used to identify multiple floral species can arise through a small number of sensory cues spanning multiple modalities. We found that innate floral choices of the hoverfly E. aeneus are a product of contextual integration of broad, plant-based olfactory cues and visual cues, where a combination of radial symmetry and reflection in the 500-700 nm wavelength range was particularly important. Our study, therefore, shows how tiny brains can efficiently encode multimodal cues to identify multiple relevant objects without prior experience.",

Moreover, the observed body selectivity generalized to non-photographic depictions of bodies such as silhouettes and stick figures.

However, these consistencies in memory have thus far only been observed for visual stimuli. We provide the first study of auditory memorability, collecting recognition memory scores from over 3000 participants listening to a sequence of different speakers saying the same sentence. We found significant consistency across participants in their memory for voice clips and for speakers across different utterances. Next, we tested regression models incorporating both low-level (e.g., fundamental frequency) and high-level (e.g., dialect) voice properties to predict their memorability. These models were significantly predictive, and cross-validated out-of-sample, supporting an inherent memorability of speakers voices. These results provide the first evidence that listeners are similar in the voices they remember, which can be reliably predicted by quantifiable voice features.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a frequently used intervention for brain modulation with highly promising scientific and therapeutic applications. Two shortcomings of TMS applications, however, are the high within-subject and between-subjects variability in response to stimulation, which undermine the robustness and reproducibility of results. A possible solution is to optimize individual responses to TMS by exploiting rapidly fluctuating state variables such as the phase and power of neural oscillations. However, there is widespread uncertainty concerning the appropriate frequency and/or phase to target. Here, we evaluate two different approaches which do not require a choice of frequency or phase but instead utilize properties of the broadband EEG signal to predict corticospinal excitability (CSE). Our results suggest that both the spectral exponent (i.e., the steepness of the EEG 1/f background or aperiodic component) and the entropy or \"complexity\" of the EEG signal are both useful predictors of CSE above and beyond band-limited features, and may be deployed in brain state-dependent TMS applications.",

    "abstract": "In our everyday experience, the sizes and weights of objects we encounter are strongly correlated. When objects are lifted, visual information about size can be combined with haptic feedback about weight, and a naive application of Bayes rule predicts that the perceived weight of larger objects should be exaggerated and smaller objects underestimated. Instead it is the smaller of two objects of equal weight that is perceived as heavier, a phenomenon termed the Size-Weight Illusion (SWI). Here we provide a normative explanation of the SWI based on principles of efficient coding, which dictate that stimulus properties should be encoded with a fidelity that depends on how frequently those properties are encountered in the natural environment. We show that the precision with which human observers estimate object weight varies as a function of both mass and volume in a manner consistent with the estimated joint distribution of those properties among everyday objects. We further show that participants seemingly \"anti-Bayesian\" biases (the SWI) are predicted by Bayesian estimation when taking into account the gradient of discriminability induced by efficient encoding. The related Material-Weight Illusion (MWI) can also be accounted for on these principles, with surface material providing a visual cue for object density. This model framework could be used to predict perceptual biases in other properties that are correlated in the natural environment.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) with hippocampal sclerosis (HS) is a common form of drug-resistant focal epilepsy in adults. Treatment for pharmacoresistant patients remains a challenge, with deep brain stimulation (DBS) showing promise for alleviating intractable seizures. This study explores the efficacy of low-frequency stimulation (LFS) on specific neuronal targets within the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit in a mouse model of MTLE.\n\nObjective/HypothesisOur previous research demonstrated that LFS of the medial perforant path (MPP) fibers in the sclerotic hippocampus reduced seizures in epileptic mice. Here, we aimed to identify the critical neuronal population responsible for this antiepileptic effect by optogenetically stimulating presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments of the MPP-dentate granule cell (DGC) synapse at 1 Hz. We hypothesize that specific targets for LFS can differentially influence seizure activity depending on the cellular identity and location within or outside the seizure focus.\n\nMethodsWe utilized the intrahippocampal kainate (ihKA) mouse model of MTLE and targeted specific neural populations using Channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2) and stereotactic optic fiber implantation. We recorded intracranial neuronal activity from freely moving chronically epileptic mice with and without optogenetic LFS up to three hours.\n\nResultsWe found that LFS of MPP fibers in the sclerotic hippocampus effectively suppressed epileptiform activity while stimulating principal cells in the MEC had no impact. Targeting DGCs in the sclerotic septal or non-sclerotic temporal hippocampus with LFS did not reduce seizure numbers but shortened the epileptiform bursts.\n\nConclusionPresynaptic stimulation of the MPP-DGC synapse within the sclerotic hippocampus is critical for seizure suppression via LFS.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMelioidosis is an emerging infectious disease caused by the soil-dwelling bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei that affects both humans and animals. It is endemic in South and Southeast Asia, and northern Australia, causing an estimated 165,000 human cases annually worldwide. Human cases have been reported in the French West Indies (Martinique and Guadeloupe) since the 1990s. Conversely, no human cases have been reported in French Guiana, a French territory in South America. Our study aimed to investigate whether B. pseudomallei is locally established in Guadeloupe and French Guiana. We assessed animal exposure by serology and examined the presence of B. pseudomallei in the environment of seropositive animals.\n\nMethodology/Principal findingsBlood samples were collected from domestic animals in two goat farms in Les Saintes, Guadeloupe (n=31), and in 56 farms in French Guiana (n=670) and tested by ELISA. Serological follow up was performed on selected farms. Soil, water and goat rectal swabs were collected and analysed by culture and PCR. In French Guiana, the highest prevalence rates were observed in equids (24%) and cattle (16%), while in Les Saintes, a prevalence of 39% was observed in goats. The longitudinal study in Les Saintes revealed consistent high seropositivity in goats. A B. pseudomallei strain was isolated from the soil from one of the farms and detected in goat rectal swabs from the other farm.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceOur environmental investigation prompted by the serologic data confirms the presence of B. pseudomallei in Les Saintes, consistent with documented human cases of melioidosis on this island. In French Guiana, our serologic results call for environmental surveys and a re-evaluation of human infections with melioidosis-like symptoms. The approach developed in this study may help to identify high-risk areas that warrant further investigation.\n\nAuthor summaryBurkholderia pseudomallei, an environmental bacterium, is the causative agent of melioidosis in humans and animals. If the disease has been historically reported to be endemic in South Asia and northern Australia, recent studies reveal its presence outside of these territories, both in the environment and among patients who have not travelled to endemic areas. Furthermore, the projected increase in extreme climatic events in the near future could increase the prevalence of the disease as well as cause its emergence in new territories. For these reasons, it is important to identify new areas at risk.\n\nOur study aimed to investigate the presence of the pathogen in French West Indies. We combined surveys in domestic animals (cattle, goats, horses, sheep, and pigs) and in the environment. The identification of seropositive animals without clinical signs, together with the isolation of B. pseudomallei in the environment of a goat farm in Guadeloupe, underscores the importance of including melioidosis in animal surveillance programs. The use of serologic methods can help identify animal exposure to the pathogen, thereby helping to identify areas where the pathogen may be present in the environment.",

Bacterial conjugation is the primary means by which antibiotic resistance genes spread among bacterial populations (Barlow, 2009; Virolle et al, 2020). Conjugative T4SSs elaborate a long extracellular filament, termed \"pilus\" to connect with the recipient cell. Previously, we solved the cryo-EM structure of a conjugative T4SS. In this article, based on additional data, we present a more complete T4SS cryo-EM structure than that published earlier. Novel structural features include details of the mismatch symmetry within the OMCC, the presence of a 4th VirB8 subunit in the asymmetric unit of both the Arches and the IMC, and a hydrophobic VirB5 tip in the distal end of the stalk. However, more significantly, we provide previously-undescribed structural insights into the protein VirB10 and identify a novel regulation mechanism of T4SS-mediated pilus biogenesis by this protein, that we believe is a key checkpoint for this process.",

Here, the expression profile of genes encoding proteins associated with c-di-GMP metabolism was analysed among 32 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains grown as suspended aggregates in synthetic sputum or planktonic cells. A diguanylate cyclase, SiaD, proved essential for auto-aggregation under in vivo-like conditions. Virtual screening against SiaD identified echinacoside as an inhibitor, which reduced intracellular c-di-GMP levels and aggregate sizes and potentiated the efficacy of tobramycin against aggregates established by >80% of tested strains.

With IAV threatening the next global influenza pandemic, it is a race against time to search for antiviral drugs. Betacyanins are unique nitrogen-containing and water-soluble reddish-violet pigments that have been reported to possess antiviral properties against dengue virus. The objective of this study was to examine the antiviral effect of betacyanins from red pitahaya (Hylocereus polyrhizus) on IAV-infected lung epithelial A549 cells. HPLC and LC-MS analysis of extracted betacyanin showed four betacyanins in the betacyanin fraction, namely phyllocactin, hylocerenin, betanin, and isobetanin. Cytotoxicity assay showed that betacyanin fractions were not cytotoxic to A549 cells at concentrations below 100 {micro}g/mL. Betacyanin fraction concentrations of 12.5, 25.0, and 50.0 {micro}g/mL prevented the formation of viral cytopathic effect and reduced virus titer in IAV-infected cells up to 72 h. A downregulation of protein and mRNA nucleoprotein expression levels was observed after treatment with 25.0 and 50.0 {micro}g/mL of betacyanin fraction after 24 h, thereby providing evidence for the anti-viral activity of betacyanin from red pitahaya against IAV in vitro.",

The only available structures of retroviral Envs are those from human and simian immunodeficiency viruses from the subfamily of orthoretroviruses, which are only distantly related to the FVs. We report here the cryo-EM structures of the FV Env ectodomain in the pre- and post-fusion states, which demonstrate structural similarity with the fusion protein (F) of paramyxo- and pneumoviruses, implying an evolutionary link between the two viral fusogens. Based on the structural information on the FV Env in two states, we propose a mechanistic model for its conformational change, highlighting how the interplay of its structural elements could drive the structural rearrangement. The structural knowledge on the FV Env now provides a framework for functional investigations such as the FV cell tropism and molecular features controlling the Env fusogenicity, which can benefit the design of FV Env variants with improved features for use as gene therapy vectors.",

    "abstract": "Small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are molecular chaperones that act to prevent the aberrant aggregation of misfolded proteins. Whilst it is widely suggested that sHsps prevent aggregation by binding to misfolded client proteins, the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of sHsps has hindered attempts to establish the mechanistic details of how sHsp-client protein complexes form. Single-molecule approaches have emerged as a powerful tool to investigate dynamic and heterogeneous interactions such as those that can occur between sHsps and their client proteins. Here, we use total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to observe and characterise the complexes formed between model aggregation-prone client proteins [firefly luciferase (FLUC), rhodanese, and chloride intracellular channel 1 protein (CLIC)], and the human sHsps B-crystallin (B-c; HSPB1) and Hsp27 (HSPB5). We show that small (monomeric or dimeric) forms of both B-c and Hsp27 bind to misfolded or oligomeric forms of the client proteins at early stages of aggregation, resulting in the formation of soluble sHsp-client complexes. Stoichiometric analysis of these complexes revealed that additional B-c subunits accumulate onto pre-existing sHsp-client complexes to form larger species - this does not occur to the same extent for Hsp27. Instead, Hsp27-client interactions tend to be more transient than those of B-c. Elucidating these mechanisms of sHsp function is crucial to our understanding of how these molecular chaperones act to inhibit protein aggregation and maintain cellular proteostasis.",

    "abstract": "Fauna passages are increasingly constructed at major roads and railways to mitigate the negative effects of infrastructure and traffic on wildlife. The function of such passages depends on their design, including the construction materials, soil and vegetation. Providing \"naturalness\" in fauna passages may entail significant costs, yet its benefits are incompletely understood. In particular, there is a demand for better knowledge support regarding combining passages for large fauna with minor roads, trails and watercourses. By using camera trap data collected across the passages, we examined ungulate substrate selection in seven passages serving both fauna and local roads (overpasses) and fauna and watercourses (underpasses) in boreal Sweden and Finland. While all substrates were used, during snow-free periods, ungulates used smoother surfaces (fine-grained topsoil, grass, artificial fiber mat, and dirt road) more than expected based on their availability. Coarser surface (stony/rocky ground), shrub, and water were used less than expected. The results for road and water were however inconsistent between passages; in one overpass road was instead used less than expected, and in one underpass the water section was used particularly during winter (ice cover) but also by moose wading or swimming through in summer and autumn. The general patterns of use largely remained when we analysed data on species level, although these analyses were restricted because of limited sample sizes. While our study has several limitations, it offers valuable insights for the planning and construction of fauna passages. To our knowledge, this study was the first of its kind to study the substrate preferences of ungulates in fauna passages, and we suggest to conduct further research in the field.",

In this study, female C57BL/6 mice (2 and 5 months old; M) were infected with a low aerosol dose (100-200 cfu) of Mtb H37Rv to monitor tissue mycobacterial load and multi-tissue metabolite profiling using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). 5M C57BL/6 mice showed separate tissue metabolic phenotype with significantly higher lung aspartic acid, fecal oxalic acid and tryptophan levels with lower liver lysine and aspartic acid and fecal phenylalanine levels (log2FC: 5M/2M> {+/-}1.0, p<0.1) compared to 2M young controls. Upon Mtb infection, the lung mycobacterial load of 2M and 5M mice were similar till 6 weeks post-infection. However, significantly higher lung phosphoric acid, malonic acid and lower mannose levels (log2FC: Mtb infected/healthy> {+/-}1.0, p<0.1) were observed in Mtb-infected 5M C57BL/6 mice. Meanwhile, Mtb-infected 2M mice showed higher liver xylose and lower lysine levels. The thigh muscles of Mtb-infected 2M and 5M mice showed increased malic acid and oxalic acid and decreased glycine, serine, and glycerol levels. Fecal aspartic acid level was higher in Mtb-infected 5M mice, while a decreased abundance of fecal lysine was observed in Mtb-infected 2M mice. Overall, this study demonstrates a deregulated tissue-specific amino acid metabolism in Mtb-infected mice groups of different age groups, which might be targeted for managing TB infection-related adverse effects.",

    "abstract": "Hericium erinaceus and Pleurotus eryngii are edible and medicinal mushrooms grown commercially in many countries around the world. In nature, H. erinaceus grows on old or dead trunks of hardwood trees. P. eryngii grows on the roots of Apiaceae plants. To exploit their beneficial properties, these mushrooms have been grown indoors using mushroom substrates mainly consisting of dry wood chips, straw, and cereals originating from forest maintenance, agriculture, and industry wastes, respectively. Additional supplements such as olive mill solid waste are added to the substrate to support mushroom development. However, the impact of substrate additives on the edible mushroom metabolic content has not been assessed so far. We examined the effect of adding to the substrate different proportions of olive mill solid waste on the metabolic profiles of the fruiting body (FB) and mycelium of H. erinaceus and P. eryngii mushrooms. We used computational metabolomics methods to analyze the untargeted metabolomics data obtained from Q-Exactive Plus high-resolution LC-MS/MS data. In general, the methanolic extracts of H. erinaceus FB and mycelium were more highly enriched with specialized metabolites than those of P. eryngii. Interestingly, olive mill solid waste increased some of the unique metabolites related to the beneficial hericenone family in the H. erinaceus FB and several erinacerin metabolites from the mycelium. At the same time, the additive decreased the toxic enniatin metabolite abundance. Altogether, we demonstrate how a change in substrate composition affects the mushrooms specialized metabolome and can induce beneficial mushroom metabolite diversity. This highlights the importance of including metabolomics strategies to investigate new sustainable growth options for edible mushrooms and other natural foods.",

    "abstract": "Agarose is commonly used for 3D cell culture and to mimic the stiffness of the pericellular matrix of articular chondrocytes. Although it is known that both temperature and mechanical stimulation affect the metabolism of chondrocytes, little is known about the thermal properties of agarose hydrogels. Thermal properties of agarose are needed to analyze potential heat production by chondrocytes induced by various experimental stimuli (carbon source, cyclical compression, etc). Utilizing ASTM C177, a custom-built thermal conductivity measuring device was constructed and used to calculate the thermal conductivity of 4.5% low gelling temperature agarose hydrogels. Additionally, Differential Scanning Calorimetry was used to calculate the specific heat capacity of the agarose hydrogels. Testing of chondrocyte-embedded agarose hydrogels commonly occurs in Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS), and thermal analysis requires the free convection coefficient of PBS. This was calculated using a 2D heat conduction simulation within MATLAB in tandem with experimental data collected for known boundary and initial conditions. The specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity of 4.5% agarose hydrogels was calculated to be 2.85 J/g{degrees}C and 0.121 W/mK, respectively. The free convection coefficient of PBS was calculated to be 1000.1 W/m2K. The values of specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity for agarose are similar to the reported values for articular cartilage, which are 3.20 J/g{degrees}C and 0.21 W/mK (Moghadam, et al. 2014). This suggests that in addition to 4.5% agarose hydrogels mimicking the physiological stiffness of the cartilage PCM, they can also mimic the thermal properties of articular cartilage for in vitro studies.",

A new frontier for the field is the generation of superstructures made from DNA origami subunits, which requires other self-assembly strategies than those used for DNA origami itself. Challenges faced by current approaches include the increasing complexity, cost and development time for the structures and off-target assembly. Here, we demonstrate how radially symmetric origami subunits that are inspired by the structure and interactions of lipids organize into giant DNA origami monolayer membranes that can be readily programmed to form vesicles or hollow tubes with diameters ranging from 100 nm to over 1 {micro}m. DNA origami membranes are an unprecedented approach for compartmentalization that opens up new possibilities for bottom-up biology and cell-scale soft robotics.",

    "abstract": "Gene delivery via adeno-associated viral vectors can provide lasting clinical benefits following a one-time treatment. Delivery throughout the brain is needed for the treatment of neurological disorders with widespread pathology, including Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Most gene vectors have poor diffusion in the brain tissue. Furthermore, it is only at high intravenous doses that gene vectors can overcome the blood-brain barrier. In contrast, relatively lower doses of gene vectors injected in the cerebrospinal fluid enable significant transduction of superficial brain regions. The remaining challenge and unmet need of gene therapy is to deliver gene vectors to deep brain structures using a minimally invasive strategy. Here, we demonstrate that non-invasive focused ultrasound blood-brain barrier modulation can increase the delivery of recombinant adeno-associated virus by 5-fold to deep brain structures following injection in the cisterna magna. Delivery of adeno-associated viral vectors to the central nervous system, via administration in the cerebrospinal fluid, is being evaluated in several clinical trials for treating beta-galactosidase-1 deficiency, Batten disease, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal muscular atrophy. Our findings suggest that the efficacy of gene therapies delivered in the cerebrospinal fluid can be enhanced by targeting brain areas of interest with focused ultrasound.\n\nSignificance statementAdministration of viral vectors in the cerebrospinal fluid through the cisterna magna is being evaluated in patients with neurological disorders. Focused ultrasound combined with intravenous microbubbles safely increases the permeability of the blood-brain barrier in humans and enables delivery of intravenous adeno-associated virus in non-human primates. Here, we demonstrate that combining these two clinically relevant gene delivery methods, intracisterna magna administration and focused ultrasound with microbubbles, can facilitate gene delivery to superficial and deep brain structures. Our findings have the potential to increase the efficacy of gene therapies, particularly for disorders with brain regions that have remained difficult to reach.",

However, the neural circuitry involved in inference-based strategies is still unclear. We developed a tone frequency discrimination task in head-fixed mice in which the tone category of the current trial depended on the category of the previous trial. When the tone category was repeated every trial, the mice continued to use the default model-free strategy, as well as when tone was randomly presented, to bias the choices. In contrast, the default strategy gradually shifted to an inference-based strategy when the tone category was alternated in each trial. Brain-wide electrophysiological recording during the overtrained phase suggested that the neural activity of the frontal and sensory cortices, hippocampus, and striatum was correlated with the reward expectation of both the model-free and inference-based strategies. These results suggest the global encoding of multiple strategies in the brain.",

In this study, we investigated the role and mechanism of Retron-Eco11, a novel type III-A3 retron system associated with a phosphoribosyltransferase-like effector protein, in phage defense. Here, we show that the Retron-Eco11 tripartite system protects against phage infection and that UvsW and D10, two functional homolog helicases found in T4 and T5 phages, respectively, serve as specific triggers for the Retron-Eco11 defense system. Our findings confirmed that msDNA and both protein components of the intron complex are indispensable for its protective function. Once the retron system detects the activity of these helicase proteins, it activates the toxicity of the effector protein bound to the retron complex, leading to an abortive infection. These findings underscore the application of a comparable anti-phage defense strategy using Retron-Eco11 across diverse phage families. This should aid in deciphering the processes through which the Retron complex detects and identifies the invading phages.",

Here, we use a combination of untargeted transcriptomics, proteomics, and comparative genomics to uncover an inducible urolithin C dehydroxylase (ucd) operon in Lachnospiraceae. Biochemical characterization and structural modeling of proteins encoded by ucd demonstrated that urolithin C dehydroxylation was NADH- dependent, required strict anaerobic conditions, and used urolithin C as an electron acceptor. By combining functional assays in complex fecal communities with publicly available metagenomic data, our study reveals that both urolithin C-metabolizing bacteria and ucd operon genes are widely distributed in gut metagenomes and likely comprise keystone species in the metabolism of urolithins by the human gut microbiota.",

    "abstract": "Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ng) is a uniquely adapted human pathogen and the etiological agent of gonorrhea, a sexually transmitted disease. Ng has developed numerous mechanisms to avoid and actively suppress innate and adaptive immune responses. Ng successfully colonizes and establishes topologically distinct colonies in human macrophages and avoids phagocytic killing. During colonization, Ng manipulates the actin cytoskeleton to invade and create an intracellular niche supportive of bacterial replication. The cellular reservoir(s) supporting bacterial replication and persistence in gonorrhea infections are poorly defined. The manner in which gonococci colonize macrophages points to this innate immune phagocyte as a strong candidate for a cellular niche during natural infection. Here we investigate whether nutrients availability and immunological polarization alter macrophage colonization by Ng. Differentiation of macrophages in pro-inflammatory (M1-like) and tolerogenic (M2-like) phenotypes prior to infection reveals that Ng can invade macrophages in all activation states, albeit with lower efficiency in M1-like macrophages. These results suggest that during natural infection, bacteria could invade and grow within macrophages regardless of the nutrients availability and the macrophage immune activation status.",

    "abstract": "Photosynthetic microorganisms, including algae and cyanobacteria, export electrons in a light-stimulated phenomenon called  exoelectrogenesis. However, the route(s) by which electrons reach an external electrode from the cell remain(s) unclear. For the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, it has been established that electron transfer does not depend on direct extracellular electron transfer by type IV pili. However, the role of the exopolysaccharide matrix in which cells are embedded has not been investigated. We show that a Synechocystis mutant with substantially reduced exopolysaccharide production has a four-fold greater photocurrent than wild-type cells. This increase is due in part to increased adhesion of exopolysaccharide-deficient cells to electrodes. Stirred system experiments reveal that a substantial portion of the photocurrent depends on an endogenous diffusible electron mediator, supporting indirect extracellular electron transfer as the bioelectrochemical mechanism of exoelectrogenesis. These findings will be important in harnessing exoelectrogenesis for sustainable electricity generation in biophotovoltaic devices.",

    "abstract": "Mycoplasma mobile is a parasitic bacterium that forms gliding machinery on the cell pole and glides on a solid surface in the direction of the cell pole. The gliding machinery consists of both internal and surface structures. The internal structure is divided into a bell at the front and chain structure extending from the bell. In this study, the internal structures prepared under several conditions were analyzed using negative-staining electron microscopy and electron tomography. The chains were constructed by linked motors containing two complexes similar to ATP synthase. A cylindrical spacer with a maximum diameter of 6 nm and a height of 13 nm, and anonymous linkers with a diameter of 0.9-8.3 nm and length of 5-30 nm were found between motors. The bell is bowl-shaped and features a honeycomb surface with a periodicity of 8.4 nm. The chains of the motor are connected to the rim of the bell through a wedge-shaped structure. These structures may play roles in the assembly and cooperation of gliding machinery units.\n\nSignificanceMycoplasma mobile, a parasitic bacterium, glides on solid surfaces at speeds of up to 4.0 m per second through a specialized mechanism. The gliding machinery, located at one pole of the cell, is composed of surface legs and internal motor structures. The force generation unit within the internal structure evolved from ATP synthase. This study aimed to clarify the entire architecture of the gliding machinery using electron tomography.",

    "abstract": "5S rDNA is essential component of all cell types. A survey was conducted to study the 5S rDNA site number, position, and origin of signal pattern diversity in 64 plants using fluorescence in situ hybridization. The species used for this experiment were chosen due to the discovery of karyotype rearrangement, and for species checked in which 5S rDNA has not yet been explored. The chromosome number was 14-160, while the chromosome length was 0.63-6.88 m, with 37 plants (58%) had small chromosome (<3 m). The chromosome numbers of three species and 5S rDNA loci of 19 species have been reported for the first time. 5S rDNA was varied and abundant in signal site number (2-18), position (e.g., interstitial, distal, and proximal position, occasionally, outside chromosome), and even as intense (e.g., strong, weak, and slight). Our results exposed modifiability in the number and location of 5S rDNA in 33 plants and demonstrated an extensive stable number and location of 5S rDNA in 31 plants. The potential origin of signal pattern diversity was probably caused by chromosome rearrangement (e.g., deletion, duplication, inversion, translocation), polyploidization, self-incompatibility, and chromosome satellites. These data characterized the variability of 5S rDNA within the karyotypes of the 64 plants that exhibited massive chromosomal rearrangements and provided anchor points for genetic physical maps. These data prove the utility of the 5S rDNA oligonucleotide as a chromosome marker in identifying plant chromosomes. This method provides a basis for developing similar applications for cytogenetic analysis in other species.\n\nArticle SummaryA survey was exploited to study 5S rDNA signal pattern diversity in 64 plants by FISH. The chromosome number of three species and 5S rDNA loci of 19 species have been reported by the first time. 5S rDNA was really rather various and abundant in signal site number (2-18), position (interstitial, distal, proximal position, occasionally, outside chromosome), even as the intense (strong, week, slight).

    "abstract": "Alpha-synuclein, encoded by the SNCA gene, is a pivotal protein implicated in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies, including Parkinsons disease. Current approaches for modulating alpha-synuclein levels involve antisense nucleotides, siRNAs, and small molecules targeting SNCAs 5-UTR mRNA. Here, we propose a groundbreaking strategy targeting G-quadruplex structures to effectively modulate SNCA gene expression and lowering alpha-synuclein amount. Novel G-quadruplex sequences, identified on the SNCA genes transcription starting site and 5-UTR of SNCA mRNAs, were experimentally confirmed for their stability through biophysical assays and in vitro experiments on human genomic DNA. Biological validation in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells revealed that well-known G-quadruplex ligands remarkably stabilized these structures, inducing the modulation of SNCA mRNAs expression, and the effective decrease in alpha-synuclein amount. Besides, a novel peptide nucleic acid conjugate, designed to selectively disrupt of G-quadruplex within the SNCA gene promoter, caused a promising lowering of both SNCA mRNA and alpha-synuclein protein. Altogether our findings highlight G-quadruplexes key role as intriguing biological targets in achieving a notable and successful reduction in alpha-synuclein expression, pointing to a novel approach against synucleinopathies.",

    "abstract": "Social insect colonies are known to be targeted by a wide variety of different parasites and pathogens because of their high host abundance. However, within a colony, the level of risk to exposure could vary among individuals depending on their role. Unlike many known parasites, which mostly target specific groups of individuals, e.g. foragers, the myrmecoparasitic fungus Rickia wasmannii infects entire ant colonies, being linked to subtle changes in physiology, morphology and behaviour. We investigated how different groups within the colonies respond to being exposed to the fungus by measuring the expression of the genes defensin 1 and prophenoloxidase, both vital components of ant immunity. We found that workers, queens and broods varied in their immune response. Workers displayed diverse profiles, with variable responses to infection: in same-age workers, both prophenoloxidase and defensin 1 levels exhibited increases in correlation with pathogen loads. Queens exhibited a more pronounced immune response. Highly infected queens had a heightened immune response. Larvae did not show a discernible response. Morphological and physiological characteristics had limited effects on gene expression, except in the case of queens, where larger individuals displayed higher defensin 1 expression. Our study shows that these divergent responses likely stem from the differing physiological needs and priorities of various groups within the colony.\n\nHighlightsO_LIIn same-age workers, prophenoloxidase and defensin 1 levels increased with pathogen loads.\nC_LIO_LIBody size affected defensin 1 expression in a caste-specific manner: larger queens displayed higher expression.\nC_LIO_LIInfection did not elicit any specific response in larvae.\nC_LIO_LIThe diverse response to infection likely arise from distinct physiological needs and priorities within colony groups.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a fundamental process in the evolution of prokaryotes, making major contributions to diversification and adaptation. Typically, HGT is facilitated by mobile genetic elements (MGEs), such as conjugative plasmids and phages that generally impose fitness costs on their hosts. However, a substantial fraction of bacterial genes is involved in defense mechanisms that limit the propagation of MGEs, raising the possibility that they can actively restrict HGT. Here we examine whether defense systems curb HGT by exploring the connections between HGT rate and the presence of 73 defense systems in 12 bacterial species. We found that only 6 defense systems, 3 of which are different CRISPR-Cas subtypes, are associated with the reduced gene gain rate on the scale of species evolution. The hosts of such defense systems tend to have a smaller pangenome size and harbor fewer phage-related genes compared to genomes lacking these systems, suggesting that these defense mechanisms inhibit HGT by limiting the integration of prophages. We hypothesize that restriction of HGT by defense systems is species-specific and depends on various ecological and genetic factors, including the burden of MGEs and fitness effect of HGT in bacterial populations.",

    "abstract": "Portability of trans-ancestral polygenic risk scores is often confounded by differences in linkage disequilibrium and genetic architecture between ancestries. Recent literature has shown that prioritizing GWAS SNPs with functional genomic evidence over strong association signals can improve model portability. We leveraged three RegulomeDB-derived functional regulatory annotations - SURF, TURF, and TLand - to construct polygenic risk models across a set of quantitative and binary traits highlighting functional mutations tagged by trait-associated tissue annotations. Tissue-specific prioritization by TURF and TLand provide a significant improvement in model accuracy over standard polygenic risk score (PRS) models across all traits. We developed the Trans-ancestral Iterative Tissue Refinement (TITR) algorithm to construct PRS models that prioritize functional mutations across multiple trait-implicated tissues. TITR-constructed PRS models show increased predictive accuracy over single tissue prioritization. This indicates our TITR approach captures a more comprehensive view of regulatory systems across implicated tissues that contribute to variance in trait expression.",
