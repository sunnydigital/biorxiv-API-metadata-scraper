    "abstract": "Despite advances in early detection and treatment strategies, breast cancer recurrence and mortality remain a significant health issue. Recent insights suggest the prognostic potential of microscopically healthy mammary gland, in the vicinity of the breast lesion. Nonetheless, a comprehensive understanding of the gene expression profiles in these tissues and their relationship to patient outcomes is still missing. Furthermore, the increasing trend towards breast-conserving surgery may inadvertently lead to the retention of existing cancer-predisposing mutations within the normal mammary gland. This study assessed the transcriptomic profiles of 242 samples from 83 breast cancer patients with unfavorable outcomes, including paired uninvolved mammary gland samples collected at varying distances from primary lesions. As a reference, control samples from 53 mammoplasty individuals without cancer history were studied. A custom panel of 634 genes linked to breast cancer progression and metastasis was employed for expression profiling, followed by whole-transcriptome verification experiments and statistical analyses to discern molecular signatures and their clinical relevance. A distinct gene expression signature was identified in uninvolved mammary gland samples, featuring key cellular components encoding keratins, CDH1, CDH3, EPCAM cell adhesion proteins, matrix metallopeptidases, oncogenes, tumor suppressors, along with crucial genes (FOXA1, RAB25, NRG1, SPDEF, TRIM29, and GABRP) having dual roles in cancer. Enrichment analyses revealed disruptions in epithelial integrity, cell adhesion, and estrogen signaling. This signature, named KAOS for Keratin-Adhesion-Oncogenes-Suppressors, was significantly associated with reduced tumor size but increased mortality rates. Integrating molecular assessment of non-malignant mammary tissue into disease management could enhance survival prediction and facilitate personalized patient care.",

    "abstract": "Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small insertions/deletions (2-50bp) in genomic regulatory regions may impact function, and although widespread, they are largely unexplored in livestock. Here leveraging >500 epigenomic datasets from pigs, cattle, sheep, and chickens, 8-39 million variants were identified with candidate functional confidence. Using our Functional Confidence scoring system, these candidate functional variants were further ranked as High, Moderate, Low, Minimal, or Possible functional confidence by scoring for likelihood of disrupting transcription factor (TF)-chromatin binding based on their presence in eight genomic regulatory features. Predictive reliability analysis of estimated breeding values (EBVs) based on High/Moderate Confidence variants from pig shows a 23[~]46% increase in reliability compared to EBVs based on general SNPs, illustrating the versatility of Functional Confidence scoring system for identifying potential functional variants in livestock. Therefore, we developed the Integrated Functional Mutation (IFmut) platform and embed the Functional Confidence scoring system for users to effortlessly navigate through epigenomic data or pinpoint specific genomic features/regions, uncover potential function of new variants or previously identified ones.

    "abstract": "Ecuador is a tropical country reporting Dengue virus (DENV) outbreaks with areas of hyperendemic viral transmission. Entomo-virological surveillance and monitoring effort conducted in the Northwestern border province of Esmeraldas in April 2022, five pools of female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes from a rural community tested positive for DENV serotype 2 by RT-qPCR. One pool was sequenced by Illumina MiSeq, and it corresponded to genotype III Southern Asian-American. Comparison with other genomes revealed genetic similarity to a human DENV genome sequenced in 2021, also from Esmeraldas. Potential introduction events to the country could have originated from Colombia, considering the vicinity of the collection sites to the neighboring country and high human movement. The inclusion of genomic information complements entomo-virological surveillance, providing valuable insights into genetic variants. This contribution enhances our understanding of Dengue virus (DENV) epidemiology in rural areas and guides evidence-based decisions for surveillance and interventions.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn this study, the complete genetic information of the dengue virus isolated from the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti was characterized using molecular biology, sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis. The isolation of the virus from the vector has contributed significantly to our understanding of the transmission dynamics of the disease and its genetic relationship with human cases. Identifying the serotypes and genotypes circulating in Ecuador has enabled us to comprehend the evolution of the virus from 2014 to 2023. Therefore, surveillance of genetic variability would aid in adapting precise prevention and control strategies to the genetic variants present in a specific geographical area. Entomo-virological surveillance is essential for assessing changes in risk and the impact of control measures.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation (DNAm) has been shown to mediate causal effects from traumatic experiences to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the scientific question about whether the mediation effect changes over time remains unclear. In this paper, we develop time-varying structural equation models to identify cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites where DNAm mediates the effect of trauma exposure on PTSD, and to capture dynamic changes in mediation effects. The proposed methodology is motivated by the Detroit Neighborhood Health Study (DNHS) with high-dimensional and longitudinal DNAm measurements. To handle the non-monotone missing DNAm in the dataset, we propose a novel Longitudinal Multiple Imputation (LMI) method utilizing dependency among repeated measurements, and employ the generalized method of moments to integrate the multiple imputations. Simulations confirm that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in various longitudinal settings. In DNHS data analysis, our method identifies several CpG sites where DNAm exhibits dynamic mediation effects. Some of the corresponding genes have been shown to be associated with PTSD in the existing literature, and our findings on their time-varying effects could deepen the understanding of the mediation role of DNAm on the causal path from trauma exposure to PTSD risk.",

    "abstract": "Public health researchers and practitioners commonly infer phylogenies from viral genome sequences to understand transmission dynamics and identify clusters of genetically-related samples. However, viruses that reassort or recombine violate phylogenetic assumptions and require more sophisticated methods. Even when phylogenies are appropriate, they can be unnecessary or difficult to interpret without specialty knowledge. For example, pairwise distances between sequences can be enough to identify clusters of related samples or assign new samples to existing phylogenetic clusters. In this work, we tested whether dimensionality reduction methods could capture known genetic groups within two human pathogenic viruses that cause substantial human morbidity and mortality and frequently reassort or recombine, respectively: seasonal influenza A/H3N2 and SARS-CoV-2. We applied principal component analysis (PCA), multidimensional scaling (MDS), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) to sequences with well-defined phylogenetic clades and either reassortment (H3N2) or recombination (SARS-CoV-2). For each low-dimensional embedding of sequences, we calculated the correlation between pairwise genetic and Euclidean distances in the embedding and applied a hierarchical clustering method to identify clusters in the embedding. We measured the accuracy of clusters compared to previously defined phylogenetic clades, reassortment clusters, or recombinant lineages. We found that MDS maintained the strongest correlation between pairwise genetic and Euclidean distances between sequences and best captured the intermediate placement of recombinant lineages between parental lineages. Clusters from t-SNE most accurately recapitulated known phylogenetic clades and recombinant lineages. Both MDS and t-SNE accurately identified reassortment groups. We show that simple statistical methods without a biological model can accurately represent known genetic relationships for relevant human pathogenic viruses. Our open source implementation of these methods for analysis of viral genome sequences can be easily applied when phylogenetic methods are either unnecessary or inappropriate.\n\nAuthor summaryTo track the progress of viral epidemics, public health researchers often need to identify groups of genetically-related samples. A common approach to find these groups involves inferring the complete evolutionary history of virus samples using phylogenetic methods. However, these methods assume that new viruses descend from a single parent, while many viruses including seasonal influenza and SARS-CoV-2 produce offspring through a form of sexual reproduction that violates this assumption. Additionally, phylogenies may be unnecessarily complex or unintuitive when researchers only need to find and visualize clusters of related samples. We tested an alternative approach by applying widely-used statistical methods (PCA, MDS, t-SNE, and UMAP) to create 2- or 3-dimensional maps of virus samples from their pairwise genetic distances and identify clusters of samples that place close together in these maps. We found that these statistical methods without an underlying biological model could accurately capture known genetic relationships in populations of seasonal influenza and SARS-CoV-2 even in the presence of sexual reproduction. The conceptual and practical simplicity of our open source implementation of these methods enables researchers to visualize and compare human pathogenic virus samples when phylogenetic methods are unnecessary or inappropriate.",

    "abstract": "Aging studies in mammalian models often depend on natural lifespan data as a primary outcome. Tools for lifespan prediction could accelerate these studies and reduce the need for veterinary intervention. Here, we leveraged large-scale longitudinal frailty and lifespan data on two genetically distinct mouse cohorts to evaluate noninvasive strategies to predict life expectancy in mice. We applied a modified frailty assessment, the Fragility Index, derived from existing frailty indices with additional deficits selected by veterinarians. We developed an ensemble machine learning classifier to predict imminent mortality (95% proportion of life lived [95PLL]). Our algorithm represented improvement over previous predictive criteria but fell short of the level of reliability that would be needed to make advanced prediction of lifespan and thus accelerate lifespan studies. Highly sensitive and specific frailty-based predictive endpoint criteria for aged mice remain elusive. While frailty-based prediction falls short as a surrogate for lifespan, it did demonstrate significant predictive power and as such must contain information that could be used to inform the conclusion of aging experiments. We propose a frailty-based measure of healthspan as an alternative target for aging research and demonstrate that lifespan and healthspan criteria reveal distinct aspects of aging in mice.",

Postulating that KS tumors contain abundant KSHV-specific T-cells, we performed transcriptional profiling and T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire analysis of tumor biopsies from 144 Ugandan adults with KS. We show that CD8+ T-cells and M2-polarized macrophages dominate the tumor micro-environment (TME). The TCR repertoire of KS tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) is shared across non-contiguous tumors and persists across time. Clusters of T-cells with predicted shared specificity for uncharacterized antigens, potentially encoded by KSHV, comprise [~]25% of KS TIL, and are shared across tumors from different time points and individuals. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of blood identifies a non-proliferating effector memory phenotype and captured the TCRs in 14,698 putative KSHV-specific T-cells.

During initial infection, HPV16, the most prevalent cancer-causing type, specifically interacts with heparan sulfates (HS), not only enabling initial cell attachment but also triggering a crucial conformational change in viral capsids termed structural activation. It is unknown, whether such HS-HPV16 interactions depend on HS sulfation patterns. Thus, we probed potential roles of HS sulfations using cell-based functional and physicochemical assays, including single molecule force spectroscopy. Our results demonstrate that N-sulfation of HS is crucial for virus binding and structural activation by providing high affinity sites, and that additional 6O-sulfation is required to mechanically stabilize the interaction, whereas 2O-sulfation and 3O-sulfation are mostly dispensable. Together, our findings identify the contribution of HS sulfation patterns to HPV16 binding and structural activation and reveal how distinct sulfation groups of HS synergize to facilitate HPV16 entry, which, in turn, likely influences the tropism of HPVs.\n\nTeaserDistinct heparan sulfations facilitate HPV16 binding and structural activation through their physico-chemical properties.",

    "abstract": "Lactococcus lactis is a lactic acid bacterium of major importance for food fermentation and biotechnological applications. The ability to manipulate its genome quickly and easily through competence for DNA transformation would accelerate its general use as a platform for a variety of applications. Natural transformation in this species requires the activation of the master regulator ComX. However, the growth conditions that lead to spontaneous transformation, as well as the regulators that control ComX production, are unknown. Here, we identified the carbon source, nitrogen supply, and pH as key factors controlling competence development in this species. Notably, we showed that these conditions are sensed by three global regulators (i.e., CcpA, CodY, and CovR), which repress comX transcription directly. Furthermore, our systematic inactivation of known signaling systems suggests that classical pheromone-sensing regulators are not involved. Finally, we discovered that the ComX-degrading MecA-ClpCP machinery plays a predominant role based on the identification of a single amino-acid substitution in the adaptor protein MecA of a highly transformable strain. Contrasting with closely-related streptococci, the master competence regulator in L. lactis is regulated both proximally by general sensors and distantly by the Clp degradation machinery. This study not only highlights the diversity of regulatory networks for competence control in Gram-positive bacteria, but it also paves the way for the use of natural transformation as a tool to manipulate this biotechnologically important bacterium.\n\nIMPORTANCELactic acid bacteria (LAB) play important roles in our daily lives as members of our microbiota or as starters of dairy products. Understanding the natural horizontal gene transfer mechanisms that shape their genomes will allow us to better control and understand their evolution over time. The DNA transformation machinery is found in all beneficial LAB species. With the exception of streptococci, however, the conditions of its activation remain unknown. In this study, the physiological conditions that activate competence for DNA transformation in Lactococcus lactis, the most important lactococcal species, were identified. We also unveiled the guardians of the master competence regulator ComX. In this species, it is directly repressed by global carbon and nitrogen regulators (CcpA and CodY) as well as the general stress system CovRS. Additionally, it was discovered that the Clp machinery degrading ComX plays a dominant role in the strict control of competence activation. In Gram-positive cocci, the hierarchical organization of these regulators for controlling competence development in L. lactis is unprecedented.",

    "abstract": "Paramyxovirus membrane fusion requires an attachment protein for receptor binding and a fusion protein for membrane fusion triggering. Nipah virus (NiV) attachment protein (G) binds to ephrinB2 or -B3 receptors, and fusion protein (F) mediates membrane fusion. NiV-F is a class I fusion protein and is activated by endosomal cleavage. The crystal structure of a soluble GCN4-decorated NiV-F shows a hexamer-of-trimer assembly. Here, we used single-molecule localization microscopy to quantify the NiV-F distribution and organization on cell and virus-like-particle membranes at a nanometer resolution. We found that NiV-F on biological membranes forms distinctive clusters that are independent of endosomal cleavage or expression levels. The sequestration of NiV-F into dense clusters favors membrane fusion triggering. The nano-distribution and organization of NiV-F are susceptible to mutations at the hexamer-of-trimer interface, and the putative oligomerization motif on the transmembrane domain. We also show that NiV-F nanoclusters are maintained by NiV-F-AP-2 interactions and the clathrin coat assembly. We propose that the organization of NiV-F into nanoclusters facilitates membrane fusion triggering by a mixed population of NiV-F molecules with varied degrees of cleavage and opportunities for interacting with the NiV-G/receptor complex. These observations provide insights into the in-situ organization and activation mechanisms of the NiV fusion machinery.",

    "abstract": "Changes in the gut microbiome have been associated with several human diseases, but the molecular and functional details underlying these associations remain largely unknown. Here, we performed a multi-cohort analysis of small molecule biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in 5,306 metagenomic samples of the gut microbiome from 2,033 Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) patients and 833 matched healthy subjects and identified a group of Clostridia-derived BGCs that are significantly associated with IBD. Using synthetic biology, we discovered and solved the structures of six fatty acid amides as the products of the IBD-enriched BGCs. Using two mouse models of colitis, we show that the discovered small molecules disrupt gut permeability and exacerbate inflammation in chemically and genetically susceptible mice. These findings suggest that microbiome-derived small molecules may play a role in the etiology of IBD and represent a generalizable approach for discovering molecular mediators of microbiome-host interactions in the context of microbiome-associated diseases.",

    "abstract": "Bread wheat is an important crop for the human diet, but the increasing soil salinization is reducing the yield. The Ca2+ signaling events at the early stages of the osmotic phase of salt stress are crucial for the acclimation response of the plants through the performance of calcium-sensing proteins, which activate or repress transcription factors (TFs) that affect the expression of downstream genes. Physiological, genetic mapping, and transcriptomics studies performed with the contrasting genotypes Syn86 (synthetic, salt-susceptible) and Zentos (elite cultivar, salt-tolerant) were integrated to gain a comprehensive understanding of the salt stress response. The MACE (Massive Analysis of cDNA 3-Ends) based transcriptome analysis until 4 h after stress exposure revealed among the salt-responsive genes, the over-representation of genes coding calcium-binding proteins. The functional and structural diversity within this category was studied and linked with the expression levels during the osmotic phase in the contrasting genotypes. The non-EF-hand category from calcium-binding genes was found to be specific for the susceptibility response. On the other side, the tolerant genotype was characterized by a faster and higher up-regulation of EF-hand genes, such as RBOHD orthologs, and TF members. This study suggests that the interplay of calcium-binding genes, WRKY, and AP2/ERF TF families in signaling pathways at the start of the osmotic phase can affect the expression of downstream genes. The identification of SNPs in promoter sequences and 3-UTR regions provides insights into the molecular mechanisms controlling the differential expression of these genes through differential transcription factor binding affinity or altered mRNA stability.\n\nKey messageThe fine-tuned expression of calcium-binding genes and transcription factors during the osmotic phase underlies the susceptibility and tolerance to salt stress responses of contrasting bread wheat genotypes.",

    "abstract": "Stress granules are cytoplasmic membraneless organelles that sequester proteins and non-translating mRNAs in response to various stressors. To assess the contributions of mRNA and RNA-binding proteins to stress granule formation, we use microinjection to deliver protein-free mRNA into the cytoplasm in a controlled manner. We demonstrate that mRNAs trigger stress granule formation through two mechanisms that are enhanced by the presence of G3BP1 and G3BP2. Low concentrations of in vitro transcribed mRNA activated protein kinase R (PKR), leading to phosphorylation and inhibition of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2 and stress granule formation. This was inhibited by replacing uridine with pseudouridine in the mRNA or by treating it with RNase III, which cleaves double-stranded RNA. High concentrations of mRNA triggered stress granule formation by a mechanism that was independent of PKR and enhanced by G3BP1/2, highlighting the importance of both protein-free mRNA and RNA-binding proteins in stress granule formation.\n\nGraphical Abstract/Model\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=197 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/578830v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b1bcfeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1eee33corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@888c9forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c835aa_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG SummaryMicroinjected mRNA induces stress granules in mammalian cells by two G3BP1/2-dependent mechanisms: one requires the stress-sensing protein kinase PKR to phosphorylate the translation initiation factor eIF2, and the other is independent of PKR and phospho-eIF2 and acts when the cytoplasmic concentration of ribosome-free mRNA is increased acutely.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac fibrosis occurs following insults to the myocardium and is characterized by the abnormal accumulation of non-compliant extracellular matrix (ECM), which compromises cardiomyocyte contractile activity and eventually leads to heart failure. This phenomenon is driven by the differentiation of cardiac fibroblasts (cFbs) into myofibroblasts and results in changes in ECM biochemical, structural and mechanical properties. The lack of predictive in vitro models of heart fibrosis has so far hampered the search for innovative treatments. Here, we devised a single-step decellularization protocol to obtain and thoroughly characterize the biochemical and micro-mechanical properties of the ECM secreted by activated cFbs differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We activated iPSC-derived cFbs to the myofibroblast phenotype by tuning basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-{beta}1) signalling and confirmed that activated cells acquired key features of myofibroblast phenotype, like SMAD2/3 nuclear shuttling, the formation of aligned alpha-smooth muscle actin (-SMA)-rich stress fibres and increased focal adhesions (FAs) assembly. Next, we used Mass Spectrometry, nanoindentation, scanning electron and confocal microscopy to unveil the characteristic composition and the visco-elastic properties of the abundant, collagen-rich ECM deposited by cardiac myofibroblasts in vitro. Finally, we demonstrated that the fibrotic ECM activates mechanosensitive pathways in iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, impacting on their shape, sarcomere alignment, phenotype, and calcium handling properties. We thus propose human bio-inspired decellularized matrices as animal-free, isogenic cardiomyocyte culture substrates recapitulating key pathophysiological changes occurring at the cellular level during cardiac fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic dysregulation is recognized as a fundamental characteristic of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), therefore mining metabolic patterns in these diseases would help to identify the possible pathogenic mechanisms and potential intervention targets. Atherosclerosis (AS), serving as the foundational pathology in numerous CVDs, represents a paramount global health concern. However, a systematic integrated analysis of the metabolic networks of AS is still lacking. In this study, we investigated and integrated single-cell RNA sequencing datasets from calcified atherosclerotic core (AC) plaques and patient-matched proximal adjacent (PA) portions of carotid artery tissue to generate metabolic flux profiling at single-cell level. Using scFEA and scWGCNA analyses, we discerned common metabolic changes in endothelial cells (ECs), myeloid cells, and smooth muscle cells. These altered metabolic modules were predominantly enriched in glucose-related pathways and were predicted to potentially facilitate metabolic bypass. Of particular interest, we observed an enrichment of metabolites produced from glucose/sialic acid metabolism pathway in both ECs and myeloid cells. This observation may partially account for their positive involvement in plaque formation, as previously discovered. Furthermore, we predicted that metabolic genes such as HK1, ENO1, PFKL, LDHA, PGK1, and NANS may be implicated in the detected metabolic flux disorder during AS progression. Additionally, we uncovered interactions between various cell types at single-cell level using CellChat. We noted heightened interactions between endothelial/SMC as well as myeloid/ECs in AC group, with ITGB2/VCAM and CD44/CD74 receptors potentially participating in these interactions, thereby fostering the development of pro-inflammatory plaque microenvironment. In conclusion, our study unveils metabolic shifts at single-cell level and identifies key gene signatures associated with metabolic disorders and cell-cell communication in atherosclerosis.",

Whereas the regulation of extra-embryonic cell fate specification has been extensively studied, little is known about the morphogenetic events underlying the formation of this lineage. Here, taking advantage of the amenability of avian embryos to live and quantitative imaging, we investigate the cell- and tissue-scale dynamics of epiboly, the process during which the epiblast expands to engulf the entire yolk. We show that tension arising from the outward migration of the epiblast border on the vitelline membrane stretches extra-embryonic cells, which reversibly transition from a columnar to squamous morphology. The propagation of this tension is strongly attenuated in the embryonic territory, which concomitantly undergoes fluid-like motion, culminating in the formation of the primitive streak. We formulate a simple viscoelastic model in which the tissue responds elastically to isotropic stress but flows in response to shear stress, and show that it recapitulates the flows and deformation of both embryonic and extra-embryonic tissues. Together, our results clarify the mechanical basis of early avian embryogenesis and provide a framework unifying the divergent mechanical behaviors observed in the contiguous embryonic and extra-embryonic territories that make up the epiblast.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThe extra-embryonic region expands radially during epiboly\nC_LIO_LICell area increase accounts for the rapid extra-embryonic expansion\nC_LIO_LIEpiboly-induced tension reversibly stretches extra-embryonic cells\nC_LIO_LIA simple viscoelastic model recovers the morphogenesis of the entire epiblast\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Microfluidic analytical tools play an important role in miniaturizing proteomic assays for improved detection sensitivity, throughput, and automation. Microfluidic isoelectric focusing (IEF) can resolve proteoforms in lysate from low-to-single cell numbers. However, IEF assays often use carrier ampholytes (CAs) to establish a pH gradient for protein separation, presenting limitations like pH instability in the form of cathodic drift (migration of focused proteins toward the cathode). Immobilized pH gradient (IPG) gels reduce cathodic drift by covalently immobilizing the pH buffering components to a matrix. To our knowledge, efforts to implement IPG gels at the microscale have been limited to glass microdevices. To adapt IEF using IPGs to widely used microfluidic device materials, we introduce a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based microfluidic device and compare the microscale pH gradient stability of IEF established with IPGs, CAs, and a hybrid formulation of IPG gels and CAs (mixed-bed IEF). The PDMS-based IPG microfluidic device (IPG) resolved analytes differing by 0.1 isoelectric point within a 3.5-mm separation lane over a 20-min focusing duration. During the 20-min duration, we observed markedly different cathodic drift velocities among the three formulations: 60.1 {micro}m/min in CA-IEF, 2.5 {micro}m/min in IPG-IEF ([~]24-fold reduction versus CA-IEF), and 1.4 {micro}m/min in mixed-bed IEF ([~]43-fold reduction versus CA-IEF). Lastly, mixed-bed IEF in a PDMS device resolved green fluorescent protein (GFP) proteoforms from GFP-expressing human breast cancer cell lysate, thus establishing stability in lysate from complex biospecimens. {micro}IPG is a promising and stable technique for studying proteoforms from small volumes.",

This has led to a resurgence in interest in the relationship between cell biophysical properties and morphological transitions. However, mapping gene or protein expression data to cell biophysical properties to physical morphogenesis remains challenging with current techniques. Here we present MATCHY (multiplexed adhesion and traction of cells at high yield). MATCHY advances the multiplexing and throughput capabilities of existing traction force and cell-cell adhesion assays using microfabrication and an automated computation scheme with machine learning-driven cell segmentation. Both biophysical assays are coupled with serial downstream immunofluorescence to extract cell type/signaling state information. MATCHY is especially suited to complex primary tissue-, organoid-, or biopsy-derived cell mixtures since it does not rely on a priori knowledge of cell surface markers, cell sorting, or use of lineage-specific reporter animals. We first validate MATCHY on canine kidney epithelial cells engineered for RET tyrosine kinase expression and quantify a relationship between downstream signaling and cell traction. We go on to create a biophysical atlas of primary cells dissociated from the mouse embryonic kidney and use MATCHY to identify distinct biophysical states along the nephron differentiation trajectory. Our data complement expression-level knowledge of adhesion molecule changes that accompany nephron differentiation with quantitative biophysical information. These data reveal an  energetic ratchet that explains spatial nephron progenitor cell condensation from the niche as they differentiate, which we validate through agent-based computational simulation.

Clinically, with single and even multiple drug intervention strategies, pathogens have developed resistance to one or all drugs utilized. This leads to the reasonable conclusion that the primary effect of any (finite) amount of drugs is delaying resistance development as opposed to prevention. Importantly, it has been shown that in sequential exposure of pathogens to antibiotics, evolution of resistance to some drugs may increase sensitivity toward others previously used, a phenomenon known as collateral sensitivity. This suggests that multidrug resistance could be avoided by an adequate use of the available drugs. Without a framework to do this however, each bug:drugs interaction network would need to be assembled blindly, an arduous experimental process. This study develops a framework for describing qualitatively collateral sensitivity networks, accordingly the interactions between emerging drug-resistant variants are modeled and a dynamic analysis is conducted to predict failure or success of sequential drug therapies.",

Trained on over 43,000 prokaryotic genomes, our network for composition-based binning is inspired by metric learning techniques used for facial recognition.\n\nUsing a task-specific, multi-GPU accelerated algorithm to cluster the embeddings produced by our network, our binner leverages marker genes observed to be universally present in nearly all taxa to grade and select optimal clusters of sequences from a hierarchy of candidates.\n\nWe evaluate our approach on four simulated datasets with known ground truth. Our linear time integration of marker genes recovers more near complete genomes than state of the art but computationally infeasible solutions using them, while being over an order of magnitude faster. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability and acuity of our approach by testing it on three of the largest metagenome assemblies ever performed. Compared to other binners, we produced 47%-183% more near complete genomes.

After isomerization to an inward-facing conformation, deprotonation of E133 and subsequent proton trans-fer from D46 to E133 opens the intracellular gate and permits galactonate dissocia-tion. After release of the second proton, apo DgoT returns to the outward-facing con-formation. Our results provide a framework to understand how various SLC17 transport functions with distinct transport stoichiometries can be attained through subtle variations in proton and substrate binding/unbinding.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian de novo DNA methylation is integral to gene regulation. This epigenetic modification is exerted by DNMT3A and DNMT3B enzymes predominantly on CpG islands. Over their enzymatic domains, DNMT3A/B shares over 90% of sequence similarity. Even so, DNMT3A prefers to methylate preferentially CGC, while DNMT3B prefers CGG sequences. To elucidate the mechanistic basis of this selective methylation profile, we performed extensive molecular dynamics simulations of DNMT3A/B enzymes bound to all possible CGX[C/G/T/A] motifs. As an outcome, we observed that the DNMT3 sequence selectivity at +2 position relies on the likelihood of a stable Arg/Lys-Guanine base-specific hydrogen bond formation. In the case of DNMT3A, Arg836 forms stable hydrogen bonds with a single guanine that is complementary to the second C in the CGC motif. In the case of DNMT3B, Arg836 is replaced by Lys777, where DNMT3B-Lys777 switches to hydrogen bonding with the two consecutive guanines in the CGG motif. The loss of branching in DNMT3B-Lys777 is further compensated by Lys777s cooperative action with Asn779. Our analysis also showed that the single nucleotide substitutions in CGX motifs lead to dramatic changes in the DNMT3A-DNA selective hydrogen bonding profile compared to the ones in DNMT3B. This finding is well correlated with the higher CpG specificity of DNMT3A compared to DNMT3B. All in all, we propose a simple explanation for a complex phenomenon, where the sequence selectivity of de novo DNMTs is directed by the guanine interaction capacity of these enzymes.",

    "abstract": "Mutational activation of KRAS occurs commonly in lung carcinogenesis and, with the recent FDA approval of covalent inhibitors of KRASG12C such as sotorasib or adagrasib, KRAS oncoproteins are important pharmacological targets in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, not all KRASG12C-driven NSCLCs respond to these inhibitors, and the emergence of drug resistance in those patients that do respond can be rapid and pleiotropic. Hence, based on a backbone of covalent inhibition of KRASG12C, efforts are underway to develop effective combination therapies. Here we report that inhibition of KRASG12C signaling increases autophagy in KRASG12C expressing lung cancer cells. Moreover, the combination of DCC-3116, a selective ULK1/2 inhibitor, plus sotorasib displays cooperative/synergistic suppression of human KRASG12C-driven lung cancer cell proliferation in vitro and superior tumor control in vivo. Additionally, in genetically engineered mouse models of KRASG12C-driven NSCLC, inhibition of either KRASG12C or ULK1/2 decreases tumor burden and increases mouse survival. Consequently, these data suggest that ULK1/2-mediated autophagy is a pharmacologically actionable cytoprotective stress response to inhibition of KRASG12C in lung cancer.",

    "abstract": "Hypertension is estimated to affect almost 1 billion people globally and significantly increases risk of myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, retinopathy and kidney disease. One major front line therapy that has been used for over 50 years involves L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (LCCBs). One class of LCCBs is the dihydropyridine family, with amlodipine being widely prescribed regardless of gender, race, ethnicity or age. In 2020, Johnson et al.7 reported that all LCCBs significantly increased the risk of heart failure, and attributed this effect to non-canonical activation of store-operated Ca2+ entry. A major approach on which they based many of their arguments was to measure cytosolic Ca2+ using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator dye fura-2. We recently demonstrated that amlodipine is highly fluorescent within cells and overwhelms the fura-2 signal, precluding the use of the indicator dye with amlodipine24. Our meta-analyses and prospective real world study showed that dihydropyridines were not associated with an increase in heart failure, likely explained by the lack of consideration by Johnson et al.7 of well-known confounding factors such as age, race, obesity, prior anti-hypertensive treatment or diabetes24. Trebak and colleagues have responded to our paper with a forthright and unwavering defence of their work27. In this paper, we carry out a forensic dissection of Johnson et al.,7 and conduct new experiments that address directly points raised by Trebak et al. 27. We show that there are major flaws in the design and interpretation of their key experiments, that fura-2 cannot be used with amlodipine, that there are fundamental mathematical misunderstandings and mistakes throughout their study leading to critical calculations on heart failure that are demonstrably wrong, and several of their own results are inconsistent with their interpretation. We therefore believe the study by Johnson et al. 7 is flawed at many levels and we stand by our conclusions.",

    "abstract": "Production of value-added, plant-derived compounds in microbes increasingly attracts commercially interest in food and pharmaceutical industries. However, plant metabolic pathways are complex, require a robust balance of enzymes, cofactors, ATP and other metabolites, and often result in low production when transplanted to bacteria. This is exemplified by the biosynthesis of curcuminoids from the Curcuma longa plant. Here, we combine dynamic pathway modeling, systematic testing of isoenzymes, and the optimization of gene expression levels and substrate concentrations for the biosynthesis of curcuminoids in Pseudomonas putida, leading to unprecedented conversion rates of caffeic acid and tyrosine to curcumin. The development of kinetic ensemble models guided the design of production strains, emphasizing the necessity of high relative expression of c3h, curs2 and dcs and, the low relative expression of tal, comt, ccoaomt, and 4cl4. This optimization resulted in a strain that achieved a 10.8 {+/-}1.8% of the maximum theoretical yield of curcumin from tyrosine. This represents a 4.1-fold increase in production efficiency and the highest yield reported to date, demonstrating the potential of P. putida as a promising platform for curcuminoid production. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of our strategy not only in the advances in the production of curcuminoids but also in setting a framework for the biosynthesis of other complex compounds.",

    "abstract": "Plant-associated microbiota affect pant growth and development by regulating plant hormones homeostasis. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), a well-known plant hormone, can be produced by various plant-associated bacteria. However, the prevalence of microbes with the capacity to degrade IAA in the rhizosphere has not been systematically studied. In this study, we analyzed the IAA degradation capabilities of bacterial isolates from the roots of Arabidopsis and rice. Using genomics analysis and in vitro assays, we found that 21 out of 189 taxonomically diverse bacterial isolates possess the ability to degrade IAA. Through comparative genomics and transcriptomic assays, we identified iac-like or iad-like operon in the genomes of these IAA degraders. Additionally, the regulator of the operon was found to be highly conserved among these strains through protein structure similarity analysis. Some of the IAA degraders could utilize IAA as their sole carbon and energy source. In planta, most of the IAA degrading strains mitigated Arabidopsis seedling root growth inhibition (RGI) triggered by exogenous IAA. Importantly, we observed increased colonization preference of IAA degraders from soil to root according to the frequency of the biomarker genes in metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) collected from different habitats, suggesting that there is a close association between IAA degraders and IAA-producers. In summary, our findings further the understanding of the functional diversity and roles of plant-associated microbes.",

    "abstract": "Vibrio cholerae O1 causes the diarrheal disease cholera, and the small intestine is the site of active infection. During cholera, cholera toxin is secreted from V. cholerae and induces a massive fluid influx into the small intestine, which causes vomiting and diarrhea. Typically, V. cholerae genomes are sequenced from bacteria passed in stool, but rarely from vomit, a fluid that may more closely represents the site of active infection. We hypothesized that the V. cholerae O1 population bottlenecks along the gastrointestinal tract would result in reduced genetic variation in stool compared to vomit. To test this, we sequenced V. cholerae genomes from ten cholera patients with paired vomit and stool samples. Genetic diversity was low in both vomit and stool, consistent with a single infecting population rather than co-infection with divergent V. cholerae O1 lineages. The number of single nucleotide variants decreased between vomit and stool in four patients, increased in two, and remained unchanged in four. The number of genes encoded in the V. cholerae genome decreased between vomit and stool in eight patients and increased in two. Pangenome analysis of assembled short-read sequencing demonstrated that the toxin-coregulated pilus operon more frequently contained deletions in genomes from vomit compared to stool. However, these deletions were not detected by PCR or long-read sequencing, indicating that interpreting gene presence or absence patterns from short-read data alone may be incomplete. Overall, we found that V. cholerae O1 isolated from stool is genetically similar to V. cholerae recovered from the upper intestinal tract.\n\nIMPORTANCEVibrio cholerae O1, the bacterium that causes cholera, is ingested in contaminated food or water and then colonizes the upper small intestine and is excreted in stool. Shed V. cholerae genomes are usually studied, but V. cholerae isolated from vomit may be more representative of where V. cholerae colonizes in the upper intestinal epithelium. V. cholerae may experience bottlenecks, or large reductions in bacterial population sizes or genetic diversity, as it passes through the gut. Passage through the gut may select for distinct V. cholerae mutants that are adapted for survival and gut colonization. We did not find strong evidence for such adaptive mutations, and instead observed that passage through the gut results in modest reductions in V. cholerae genetic diversity, and only in some patients. These results fill a gap in our understanding of the V. cholerae life cycle, transmission, and evolution.",

    "abstract": "The cellular arrangement and segregation choreography of the genetic material is involved in the timing of assembly and cellular positioning of the cell division apparatus in bacteria. Key to this mode of regulation is the positioning of sister copies of the replication terminus zone (ter) of the chromosomes at the end of the replication cycle. The Vibrio cholerae genome is distributed on two chromosomes, ChrI and ChrII. ChrI is derived from the ancestor of the Vibrionales and Enterobacterales. ChrII is derived from a megaplasmid. ChrI encodes for a homologue of MatP, a protein that tethers sister copies of the ter of the Escherichia coli chromosome together at mid-cell at the time of cell division. MatP structures the ter by binding to a ter-specific DNA motif, matS. It forms tetramers that can bridge DNA segments together and it connects sister ter copies to the divisome via an interaction with a cell division protein, ZapB. We find that MatP structures the ter of ChrI and ChrII, ter1 and ter2, and ensures the cohesion and mid-cell position of sister ter1 and ter2 copies at the time of cell division, demonstrating that ChrII is organised and behaves as a bona fide chromosome. We show that cohesion and positioning are independent of cell division and tetramer formation, but are linked to the local density of matS sites, with sister ter2 separating earlier than sister ter1 because of a lower number of matS sites. Overall, our results suggest that the primary mechanism of action of MatP is to slow down the decatenation of newly replicated molecules.",

    "abstract": "Polyomavirus (PyV) Large T-antigen (LT) is the major viral regulatory protein that targets numerous cellular factors/pathways: tumor suppressors, cell cycle regulators, transcription and chromatin regulators, as well as other factors for viral replication. LT directly recruits the cellular replication factors involved in LTs recognition of the viral origin, origin unwinding, and primer synthesis which is carried out by mutual interactions between LT, DNA polymerase alpha-primase (Polprim), and single strand (ss) DNA binding replication protein A (RPA). The activities as well as interactions of these three with each other as well as other factors, are known to be modulated by post-translational modifications (PTMs); however, modern high-sensitivity proteomic analyses of the PTMs as well as proteins associated with the three have been lacking. Elution from immunoprecipitation (IP) of the three factors were subjected to high-resolution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We identified 479 novel phosphorylated amino acid residues (PAARs) on the three factors: 82 PAARs on SV40 LT, 305 on the Polprim heterotetrametric complex and 92 on the RPA heterotrimeric complex. LC-MS/MS analysis also identified proteins that co-immunoprecipitated (coIP-ed) with the three factors that were not previously reported: 374 with LT, 453 with Polprim and 183 with RPA. We used a bioinformatic-based approach to analyze the proteomics data and demonstrate a highly significant \"enrichment\" of transcription-related process associated uniquely with LT, consistent with its role as a transcriptional regulator, as opposed to Polprim and RPA associated proteins which showed no such enrichment. The most significant cell cycle related network was regulated by ETS proto-oncogene 1 (ETS1), indicating its involvement in regulatory control of DNA replication, repair, and metabolism. The interaction between LT and ETS1 is validated and shown to be independent of nucleic acids. One of the novel phosphorylated aa residues detected on LT from this study, has been demonstrated by us to affect DNA replication activities of SV40 Large T-antigen. Our data provide substantial additional novel information on PAARs, and proteins associated with PyV LT, and the cellular Polprim-, RPA- complexes which will benefit research in DNA replication, transformation, transcription, and other viral and host cellular processes.",

Most of our current knowledge about TE organization, dynamics and evolution derives from investigations in model organisms with a relatively small genome size such as Drosophila melanogaster or Arabidopsis thaliana. Whether the observed patterns hold true in larger genomes remains to be determined. The Diptera order is an ideal taxon to address this question, because it includes a forty-year model of TE biology (D. melanogaster) as well as mosquito species with significantly larger genomes. Here, we use a comparative genomics approach to characterize the genomic forces that have shaped the TE content of the Aedes aegypti genome (1.3 Gb) relative to the Anopheles coluzzii genome (300 Mb) and the D. melanogaster genome (180 Mb). Leveraging a newly developed high-quality TE library for Ae. aegypti, our results reveal a contrasted pattern of TE organization in Ae. aegypti compared to An. coluzzii and D. melanogaster. Our analyses suggest that the substantial TE fraction observed in the Ae. aegypti genome reflect both a high rate of TE transposition and a low rate of TE elimination. Together, our results indicate that TE organization and evolutionary dynamics in the large genome of Ae. aegypti are distinct from those of other dipterans with smaller genomes.",

Mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA_CN) can be used as a proxy for mitochondria number, size, and activity. The aims of our study are to evaluate the effect of mtDNA_CN and mitochondrial haploblocks on production traits in pigs, and to identify the genetic background of this cellular phenotype. We collected performance data of 234 pigs and extracted DNA from skeletal muscle. Whole-genome sequencing data was used to determine mtDNA_CN. We detected positive correlations of muscle mtDNA_CN with backfat thickness at 207 d (+0.14; p-value = 0.07), and negative correlations with carcase loin thickness (-0.14; p-value = 0.03). Pigs with less mtDNA_CN had greater loin thickness (+4.1 mm; p-value = 0.01) and lower backfat thickness (-1.1 mm; p-value = 0.08), which resulted in greater carcase lean percentage (+2.4%; p-value = 0.04) than pigs with high mtDNA_CN. These results support the hypothesis that a reduction of mitochondrial activity is associated with greater feed efficiency. Pork from pigs with less mtDNA_CN may also tend to have lower ultimate pH (correlation: +0.19; p-value < 0.01). We found no association of the most frequent mitochondrial haploblocks with mtDNA_CN or the production traits, but several genomic regions that harbour potential candidate genes with functions related to mitochondrial biogenesis and homeostasis were associated to mtDNA_CN. These regions provide new insights into the genetic background of this cellular phenotype but it is still uncertain if such associations translate into noticeable effects on the production traits.",

Despite this promise, the currently available CBEs have the significant liabilities of off-target and bystander editing activities, in part due to the mechanism by which they are delivered, causing limitations in their potential applications. In this study we engineeredhighly stabilized Cas-embedded CBEs (sCE_CBEs) that integrate several recent advances, andthat are highly expressible and soluble for direct delivery into cells as ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. Our resulting sCE_CBE RNP complexes efficiently and specifically target TC dinucleotides with minimal off-target or bystander mutations. Additional uracil glycosylase inhibitor (UGI) protein in trans further increased C-to-T editing efficiency and target purity in a dose-dependent manner, minimizing indel formation to untreated levels. A single electroporation was sufficient to effectively edit the therapeutically relevant locus for sickle cell disease in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) in a dose dependent manner without cellular toxicity. Significantly, these sCE_CBE RNPs permitted for the transplantation of edited HSPCs confirming highly efficient editing in engrafting hematopoietic stem cells in mice. The success of the designed sCBE editors, with improved solubility and enhanced on-target editing, demonstrates promising agents for cytosine base editing at other disease-related sites in HSPCs and other cell types.",

Using a broad-host-range conjugative plasmid, we enabled various bacterial species from a municipal wastewater sample to express FAST-PETase, which was released into the extracellular environment. We found that FAST-PETase purified from some isolates could degrade about 40% of a 0.25 mm thick PET film within four days at 50 {degrees}C. We then demonstrate partial degradation of post-consumer PET over 5-7 days by exposure to conditioned media from isolates. These results have broad implications for addressing the global plastic pollution problem by enabling environmental bacteria to degrade PET plastics in situ.",

    "abstract": "Circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) have gained significant attention for discovering tumor biomarkers. However, isolating EVs with well-defined homogeneous populations from complex biological samples is challenging. Different isolation methods have been found to derive different EV populations carrying different molecular contents, which confounds current investigations and hinders subsequent clinical translation. Therefore, standardizing and building a rigorous assessment of isolated EV quality associated with downstream molecular analysis is essential. To address this need, we introduce a statistical algorithm (ExoQuality Index, EQI) by integrating multiple EV characterizations (size, particle concentration, zeta potential, total protein, and RNA), enabling direct EV quality assessment and comparisons between different isolation methods. We also introduced a novel capture-release isolation approach using a pH-responsive peptide conjugated with NanoPom magnetic beads (ExCy) for simple, fast, and homogeneous EV isolation from various biological fluids. Bioinformatic analysis of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data of EV total RNAs from pancreatic cancer patient plasma samples using our novel EV isolation approach and quality index strategy illuminates how this approach improves the identification of tumor associated molecular markers. Results showed higher human mRNA coverage compared to existing isolation approaches in terms of both pancreatic cancer pathways and EV cellular component pathways using gProfiler pathway analysis. This study provides a valuable resource for researchers, establishing a workflow to prepare and analyze EV samples carefully and contributing to the advancement of reliable and rigorous EV quality assessment and clinical translation.",

Electrospinning was used to prepare the membranes containing the maximum concentration of HS and AGE, which were then sterilized with ozone. Microbiological tests confirmed effective sterilization. The membrane characterization included scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for morphological analysis, wettability studies for contact angle determination, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis, and thermogravimetry (TGA) for thermal analysis. Results indicated successful preparation and sterilization of PCL membranes modified with HS and EFA. Morphological analysis showed well-formed and randomly distributed fibers, although the PCL+HS membrane exhibited beads on its fibers. Adding HS and EFA affected the fiber diameter, with PCL+HS fibers having a smaller diameter than pure PCL and PCL+EFA fibers. Wettability analysis demonstrated modified surface properties with reduced contact angles. FT-IR analysis showed slight contributions of HS and EFA in the modified PCL membranes, while thermal analysis revealed no substantial changes in thermal stability. In conclusion, PCL membranes modified with HS and EFA can potentially accelerate wound healing, presenting an innovative and cost-effective approach to treating skin injuries.",

    "abstract": "The 3D structure of RNA critically influences its functionality, and understanding this structure is vital for deciphering RNA biology. Experimental methods for determining RNA structures are labour-intensive, expensive, and time-consuming. Computational approaches have emerged as valuable tools, leveraging physics-based-principles and machine learning to predict RNA structures rapidly. Despite advancements, the accuracy of computational methods remains modest, especially when compared to protein structure prediction. Deep learning methods, while successful in protein structure prediction, have shown some promise for RNA structure prediction as well but face unique challenges. This study systematically benchmarks state-of-the-art deep learning methods for RNA structure prediction across diverse datasets. Our aim is to identify factors influencing performance variation, such as RNA family diversity, sequence length, RNA type, multiple sequence alignment (MSA) quality, and deep learning model architecture. We show that generally ML-based methods perform much better than non-ML methods on most RNA targets, although the performance difference isnt substantial when working with unseen novel or synthetic RNAs. The quality of the MSA and secondary structure prediction both play an important role and most methods arent able to predict non-Watson-Crick pairs in the RNAs. Overall, DeepFoldRNA has the best prediction followed by DRFold as the second best method. Finally, we also suggest possible mitigations to improve the quality of the prediction for future method development.",

    "abstract": "Neoantigens, formed by genetic mutations in tumor cells, are abnormal peptides that can trigger immune responses. Precisely identifying neoantigens from vast mutations is the key to tumor immunotherapy design. There are three main steps in the neoantigen immune process, i.e., binding with MHCs, extracellular presentation, and induction of immunogenicity. Various machine learning methods have been developed to predict the probability of one of the three events, but the overall accuracy of neoantigen identification remains far from satisfactory. To gain a systematic understanding of the key factors of neoantigen identification, we developed a unified transformer-based machine learning framework ImmuBPI that comprised three tasks and achieved state-of-the-art performance. Through cross-task model interpretation, we have discovered an underestimation of data bias for immunogenicity prediction, which has led to skewed discriminatory boundaries of current machine learning models. We designed a mutual information-based debiasing strategy that performed well on mutation variants immunogenicity prediction, a task where current methods fell short. Clustering immunogenic peptides with debiased representations uncovers unique preferences for biophysical properties, such as hydrophobicity and polarity. These observations serve as an important complement to the past understanding that accurately predicting neoantigen is constrained by limited data, highlighting the necessity of bias control. We expect this study will provide novel and insightful perspectives for neoantigen prediction methods and benefit future neoantigen-mediated immunotherapy designs.\n\nAvailabilityThe code of our work is available at https://github.com/WangLabTHU/ImmuBPI",

    "abstract": "In recent years, reticulocyte-binding protein homologue 5 (RH5) has emerged as a leading blood-stage Plasmodium falciparum malaria vaccine antigen. The most advanced blood-stage vaccine candidate in a Phase 2b clinical trial, RH5.1/Matrix-M, is based on a full-length soluble protein-with-adjuvant formulation. RH5 interacts with cysteine-rich protective antigen (CyRPA) and RH5- interacting protein (RIPR) to form an essential heterotrimeric \"RCR-complex\". Here, we investigated whether a vaccine candidate based on the ternary RCR-complex could substantially improve upon the leading clinical candidate RH5.1/Matrix-M in preclinical studies. Using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) we confirm that parasite growth-inhibitory epitopes on each antigen are exposed on the surface of the RCR-complex and that mAb pairs binding to different antigens can function additively or synergistically to mediate parasite growth inhibition activity (GIA) in vitro. However, immunisation of rats with the RCR-complex consistently fails to outperform RH5.1 alone. We show this is due to immuno-dominance of RIPR coupled with the inferior potency of anti-full length RIPR polyclonal IgG antibodies as compared to the anti-RH5 and anti-CyRPA response. To address this, we identified the growth-inhibitory antibody epitopes of RIPR are clustered within C-terminal EGF-like domains of RIPR. A fusion of these EGF domains to CyRPA, called \"R78C\", combined with RH5.1, provided a new vaccination strategy that improves upon the levels of in vitro GIA seen with RH5.1 alone. Superiority of the combination antigen vaccine candidate was achieved by the induction of a quantitatively higher, but qualitatively similar, polyclonal antibody response that demonstrated additive GIA across the three antigen targets. These preclinical data justified the advancement of the RH5.1+R78C/Matrix-M combination vaccine to a Phase 1 clinical trial.",

    "abstract": "Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) is an innate immune receptor that localizes to endosomes in antigen presenting cells and recognizes single stranded unmethylated CpG sites on bacterial genomic DNA. Previous bioinformatic studies have indicated that the genome of the human pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis contains TLR9 stimulatory motifs, and correlative studies have implied a link between human TLR9 (hTLR9) genotype variants and susceptibility to infection. Here we present our evaluation of the stimulatory potential of C. trachomatis gDNA and its recognition by hTLR9- and murine TLR9 (mTLR9)-expressing cells. We confirm that hTLR9 colocalizes with chlamydial inclusions in the pro-monocytic cell line, U937. Utilizing HEK293 reporter cell lines, we demonstrate that purified genomic DNA from C. trachomatis can stimulate hTLR9 signaling, albeit at lower levels than gDNA prepared from other Gram-negative bacteria. Interestingly, we found that while C. trachomatis is capable of signaling through hTLR9 and mTLR9 during live infections in non-phagocytic HEK293 reporter cell lines, signaling only occurs at later developmental time points. Chlamydia-specific induction of hTLR9 is blocked when protein synthesis is inhibited prior to the RB-to-EB conversion and exacerbated by the inhibition of lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis. The induction of aberrance / persistence also significantly alters Chlamydia-specific TLR9 signaling. Our observations support the hypothesis that chlamydial gDNA is released at appreciable levels by the bacterium during the conversion between its replicative and infectious forms and during treatment with antibiotics targeting peptidoglycan assembly.",

We found that the circadian period is compensated for fluctuations in the turnover rates of circadian repressor proteins and uncovered possible mechanisms using a mathematical model.

    "abstract": "Cellular signaling, crucial for biological processes like immune response and homeostasis, relies on specificity and fidelity in signal transduction to accurately respond to stimuli amidst biological noise. Kinetic proofreading (KPR) is a key mechanism enhancing signaling specificity through time-delayed steps, although its effectiveness is debated due to intrinsic noise potentially reducing signal fidelity. In this study, we reformulate the theory of kinetic proofreading (KPR) by convolving multiple intermediate states into a single state and then define an overall \"processing\" time required to traverse these states. This simplification allows us to succinctly describe kinetic proofreading in terms of a single waiting time parameter, facilitating a more direct evaluation and comparison of KPR performance across different biological contexts such as DNA replication and T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. We find that loss of fidelity for longer proofreading steps relies on the specific strategy of information extraction and show that in the first-passage time (FPT) discrimination strategy, longer proofreading steps can exponentially improve the accuracy of KPR at the cost of speed. Thus, KPR can still be an effective discrimination mechanism in the high noise regime. However, in a product concentration-based discrimination strategy, longer proofreading steps do not necessarily lead to an increase in performance. However, by introducing activation thresholds on product concentrations, can we decompose the product-based strategy into a series of FPT-based strategies to better resolve the subtleties of KPR-mediated product discrimination. Our findings underscore the importance of understanding KPR in the context of how information is extracted and processed in the cell.\n\nAuthor summaryKinetic proofreading (KPR) is mechanism often employed by cells to enhance specificity of ligand-receptor. However, the performance of kinetic proofreading may be hampered by noise and a low signal-to-noise ratio. By consolidating multiple kinetic proofreading steps into a single state and assigning an associated waiting, or \"processing time,\" we developed an analytic approach to quantify the performance of KPR in different biological contexts. Despite a trade-off between speed and accuracy inherent to a first-passage time KPR strategy, we show that a signaling molecule-based discrimination strategy can enhance the performance benefits of KPR. We further decompose the product-based discrimination strategy into a set of first-passage times to different thresholds of signaling molecules produced. Through this decomposition, we find that a threshold that adjusts dynamically throughout the recognition process depends on the duration of the process. We propose that this more nuanced product-based KPR-mediated recognition process can be realized biologically. The precise structural basis for a dynamic threshold merits further experimental exploration, as it may hold significant implications for understanding biological mechanisms of information transmission at a molecular level.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered proteins have dynamic structures through which they play key biological roles. The elucidation of their conformational ensembles is a challenging problem requiring an integrated use of computational and experimental methods. Molecular simulations are a valuable computational strategy for constructing structural ensembles of disordered proteins but are highly resource-intensive. Recently, machine learning approaches based on deep generative models that learn from simulation data have emerged as an efficient alternative for generating structural ensembles. However, such methods currently suffer from limited transferability when modeling sequences and conformations absent in the training data. Here, we develop a novel generative model that achieves high levels of transferability for intrinsically disordered protein ensembles. The approach, named idpSAM, is a latent diffusion model based on transformer neural networks. It combines an autoencoder to learn a representation of protein geometry and a diffusion model to sample novel conformations in the encoded space. IdpSAM was trained on a large dataset of simulations of disordered protein regions performed with the ABSINTH implicit solvent model. Thanks to the expressiveness of its neural networks and its training stability, idpSAM faithfully captures 3D structural ensembles of test sequences with no similarity in the training set. Our study also demonstrates the potential for generating full conformational ensembles from datasets with limited sampling and underscores the importance of training set size for generalization. We believe that idpSAM represents a significant progress in transferable protein ensemble modeling through machine learning.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYProteins are essential molecules in living organisms and some of them have highly dynamical structures, which makes understanding their biological roles challenging. Disordered proteins can be studied through a combination of computer simulations and experiments. Computer simulations are often resource-intensive. Recently, machine learning has been used to make this process more efficient. The strategy is to learn from previous simulations to model the heterogenous conformations of proteins. However, such methods still suffer from poor transferability, meaning that they tend to make incorrect predictions on proteins not seen in training data. In this study, we present idpSAM, a method based on generative artificial intelligence for modeling the structures of disordered proteins. The model was trained using a vast dataset and, thanks to its architecture and training procedure, it performs well on not just proteins in the training set but achieves high levels transferability to proteins unseen in training. This advancement is a step forward in modeling biologically relevant disordered proteins. It shows how the combination of generative modeling and large training sets and can aid us understand how dynamical proteins behave.",

    "abstract": "Live-cell microscopy routinely provides massive amount of time-lapse images of complex cellular systems under various physiological or therapeutic conditions. However, this wealth of data remains difficult to interpret in terms of causal effects. Here, we describe CausalXtract, a flexible computational pipeline that discovers causal and possibly time-lagged effects from morphodynamic features and cell-cell interactions in live-cell imaging data. CausalXtract methodology combines network-based and information-based frameworks, which is shown to discover causal effects overlooked by classical Granger and Schreiber causality approaches. We showcase the use of CausalXtract to uncover novel causal effects in a tumor-on-chip cellular ecosystem under therapeutically relevant conditions. In particular, we find that cancer associated fibroblasts directly inhibit cancer cell apoptosis, independently from anti-cancer treatment. CausalXtract uncovers also multiple antagonistic effects at different time delays. Hence, CausalXtract provides a unique computational tool to interpret live-cell imaging data for a range of fundamental and translational research applications.",

    "abstract": "Spatial transcriptomics has emerged as a powerful tool for dissecting spatial cellular heterogeneity but as of today is largely limited to gene expression analysis. Yet, the life of RNA molecules is multifaceted and dynamic, requiring spatial profiling of different RNA species throughout the life cycle to delve into the intricate RNA biology in complex tissues. Human disease-relevant tissues are commonly preserved as formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks, representing an important resource for human tissue specimens. The capability to spatially explore RNA biology in FFPE tissues holds transformative potential for human biology research and clinical histopathology. Here, we present Patho-DBiT combining in situ polyadenylation and deterministic barcoding for spatial full coverage transcriptome sequencing, tailored for probing the diverse landscape of RNA species even in clinically archived FFPE samples. It permits spatial co-profiling of gene expression and RNA processing, unveiling region-specific splicing isoforms, and high-sensitivity transcriptomic mapping of clinical tumor FFPE tissues stored for five years. Furthermore, genome-wide single nucleotide RNA variants can be captured to distinguish different malignant clones from non-malignant cells in human lymphomas. Patho-DBiT also maps microRNA-mRNA regulatory networks and RNA splicing dynamics, decoding their roles in spatial tumorigenesis trajectory. High resolution Patho-DBiT at the cellular level reveals a spatial neighborhood and traces the spatiotemporal kinetics driving tumor progression. Patho-DBiT stands poised as a valuable platform to unravel rich RNA biology in FFPE tissues to study human tissue biology and aid in clinical pathology evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Tissue morphogenesis is intimately linked to the changes in shape and organisation of individual cells. In curved epithelia, cells can intercalate along their own apicobasal axes adopting a shape named \"scutoid\" that allows energy minimization in the tissue. Although several geometric and biophysical factors have been associated with this 3D reorganisation, the dynamic changes underlying scutoid formation in 3D epithelial packing remain poorly understood. Here we use live-imaging of the sea star embryo coupled with deep learning-based segmentation, to dissect the relative contributions of cell density, tissue compaction, and cell proliferation on epithelial architecture. We find that tissue compaction, which naturally occurs in the embryo, is necessary for the appearance of scutoids. Physical compression experiments identify cell density as the factor promoting scutoid formation at a global level. Finally, the comparison of the developing embryo with computational models indicates that the increase in the proportion of scutoids is directly associated with cell divisions. Our results suggest that apico-basal intercalations appearing just after mitosis may help accommodate the new cells within the tissue. We propose that proliferation in a compact epithelium induces 3D cell rearrangements during development.\n\nSummary statementThe study uses sea star embryogenesis as a model of a proliferating epithelium to highlight how cell division induces 3D cell rearrangements during development.",

    "abstract": "The distribution of fitness effects (DFE) describes the proportions of new mutations that have different effects on reproductive fitness. Accurate measurements of the DFE are important because the DFE is a fundamental parameter in evolutionary genetics and has implications for our understanding of other phenomena like complex disease or inbreeding depression. Current computational methods to infer the DFE for nonsynonymous mutations from natural variation first estimate demographic parameters from synonymous variants to control for the effects of demography and background selection. Then, conditional on these parameters, the DFE is then inferred for nonsynonymous mutations. This approach relies on the assumption that synonymous variants are neutrally evolving. However, some evidence points toward synonymous mutations having measurable effects on fitness. To test whether selection on synonymous mutations affects inference of the DFE of nonsynonymous mutations, we simulated several possible models of selection on synonymous mutations using SLiM and attempted to recover the DFE of nonsynonymous mutations using Fit{partial}a{partial}i, a common method for DFE inference. Our results show that the presence of selection on synonymous variants leads to incorrect inferences of recent population growth. Furthermore, under certain parameter combinations, inferences of the DFE can have an inflated proportion of highly deleterious nonsynonymous mutations. However, this bias can be eliminated if the correct demographic parameters are used for DFE inference instead of the biased ones inferred from synonymous variants. Our work demonstrates how unmodeled selection on synonymous mutations may affect downstream inferences of the DFE.",

    "abstract": "Uterine fibroids (UFs), benign tumours prevalent in up to 80% of women of reproductive age, are associated with significant morbidity, including abnormal uterine bleeding, pain and infertility. Despite identification of key genomic alterations in MED12 and HMGA2, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying UFs and heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) remain poorly understood. To correlate systematically genetic, transcriptional and proteomic phenotypes, our study involved an integrative analysis of fibroid, myometrium and endometrium tissues from 137 patients, utilising genome-wide SNP arrays, targeted sequencing, RNA sequencing and proteomics. Our findings reveal 39.7% of UFs possess MED12 mutations, alongside novel variants in genes such as COL4A5 and COL4A6. Multi-omics factor analysis of integrated protein and mRNA highlighted differential regulation related to extracellular matrix remodelling, proteolysis and homeostasis in fibroid versus myometrium tissues, and distinct gene sets associated with RNA splicing in the endometrium of patients with HMB, particularly in MED12-mutated fibroids. Our study proposes a model, which is supported by in vivo evidence, where altered signalling of MED12-mutated fibroids influences RNA transcript isoform expression in endometrium, potentially leading to abnormal uterine bleeding. This integrative approach unravels complex molecular pathways in UF pathogenesis and HMB, offering novel insights for targeted therapeutic development.",

    "abstract": "Non-invasive detection of protein biomarkers in plasma is crucial for clinical purposes. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is the gold standard technique for plasma proteome analysis, but despite recent advances, it remains limited by throughput, cost, and coverage. Here, we introduce a new hybrid method, which integrates direct infusion shotgun proteome analysis (DISPA) with nanoparticle (NP) protein coronas enrichment for high throughput and efficient plasma proteomic profiling. We realized over 280 protein identifications in 1.4 minutes collection time, which enables a potential throughput of approximately 1,000 samples daily. The identified proteins are involved in valuable pathways and 44 of the proteins are FDA approved biomarkers. The robustness and quantitative accuracy of this method were evaluated across multiple NPs and concentrations with a mean coefficient of variation at 17%. Moreover, different protein corona profiles were observed among various nanoparticles based on their distinct surface modifications, and all NP protein profiles exhibited deeper coverage and better quantification than neat plasma. Our streamlined workflow merges coverage and throughput with precise quantification, leveraging both DISPA and NP protein corona enrichments. This underscores the significant potential of DISPA when paired with NP sample preparation techniques for plasma proteome studies.",

    "abstract": "GoDig, a recent platform for targeted pathway proteomics without the need for manual assay scheduling or synthetic standard peptides, is a relatively flexible and easy-to-use method that uses tandem mass tags (TMT) to increase sample throughput up to 18-fold relative to label-free targeted proteomics. Though the protein quantification success rate of GoDig is generally high, the peptide-level success rate is more limited, hampering the extension of GoDig to assays of harder-to-quantify proteins and site-specific phenomena. In order to guide the optimization of GoDig assays as well as improvements to the GoDig platform, we created GoDigViewer, a new stand-alone software that provides detailed visualizations of GoDig runs. GoDigViewer guided the implementation of \"priming runs,\" an acquisition mode with significantly higher success rates due to improved elution order calibration. In this mode, one or more chromatographic priming runs are automatically performed to determine accurate and precise target elution orders, followed by analytical runs which quantify targets. Using priming runs, peptide-level quantification success rates exceeded 97% for a list of 400 peptide targets and 95% for a list of 200 targets that are usually not quantified using untargeted mass spectrometry. We used priming runs to establish a quantitative assay of 125 macroautophagy proteins that had a >95% success rate and revealed differences in macroautophagy protein expression profiles across four human cell lines.",

    "abstract": "The transcriptional dynamic of mammalian cells when these transit from the ubiquitous mitotic to a meiotic specific program is key to understand this switch central to sexual reproduction. By quantifying active RNA polymerase II and nascent transcripts using single cell dataset and ethynyl-uridine pool-down with sorted cells from synchronised testes, we detailed the transcriptional activity of murine male germ cells. When spermatogonia differentiate, transcription slows down, reaching minimal activity at meiotic entry and resumes during pachytene stage. This event, we termed EMLT (for early meiotic low transcription), is distinct from the silencing of sex chromosomes as it is independent of Setdb1 though it is accompanied by the same chromatin mark, H3K9me3. EMLT is delayed in Stra8KO but occurs in mutants altering meiotic chromosome structure or DSB formation or repair. By comparing transcript abundance and neotranscription we unveil a massive event of mRNA stabilization that parallels EMLT. Altogether our data indicate that meiosis is initiated with a nearly silent genome and we propose that the stabilization of transcripts at that time facilitates the meiotic entry by synchronising the expression of several meiotic sub-programs.",

    "abstract": "Background and aimsNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major health care challenge and new therapies are urgently needed. However, the mechanisms underlying disease remain to be understood. Indeed, studying NAFLD remains challenging due to the lack of model systems recapitulating the different aspects of the human pathology. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) offer a unique opportunity to address this limitation since they can be differentiated into large quantity of liver cells. Here, we took advantage of hiPSCs to develop a multi-cellular platform mimicking the complex interplays involved in NAFLD progression.\n\nMethodshiPSCs-derived hepatocyte like cells (HLCs), cholangiocytes, stellate cells, and macrophages were co-cultured in a collagen-based 3D system to reproduce the liver microenvironment. Fatty acid treatments led to a NAFLD phenotype involving cell-cell interactions which were investigated by transcriptomic and functional analyses.\n\nResultsHepatic cells were grown up to 4weeks in 3D, retaining key functions and markers. Importantly, co-cultured cells spontaneously reorganised into physiologically relevant connections: HLCs arranged around biliary structures, which established contacts with stellate cells, while macrophages organised around HLCs. Fatty acid treatments induced steatosis and lipotoxicity in HLCs. Furthermore, fat-laden HLCs prompted a non-parenchymal cells response altering tissue architecture.\n\nConclusionsOur multicellular platform provides a new approach to model interactions between human hepatic cells during NAFLD progression. Such approach has the potential to investigate the sequential events driving chronic liver diseases, including hepatocellular injury, inflammation and fibrosis. Furthermore, our system provides a unique and urgently needed tool to investigate the molecular mechanisms associated with NAFLD and ultimately to validate new targets for therapeutics development.\n\nList of abbreviationsCOs, cholangiocytes organoids; FFA, free fatty acids; hiPSCs, human induced pluripotent stem cells; HLCs, hepatocyte like cells; HSCs, hepatic stellate cells; M0, hiPSCs-derived macrophages; NAFLD, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; NPCs, non-parenchymal cells; OA, oleic acid; PA, palmitic acid.",

    "abstract": "The dynamic nature of the mitochondrial network is regulated by mitochondrial fission and fusion, allowing for re-organization of mitochondria to adapt to the cells ever-changing needs. As organisms age, mitochondrial fission and fusion become dysregulated and mitochondrial networks become increasingly fragmented. Modulation of mitochondrial dynamics has been shown to affect longevity in fungi, yeast, Drosophila and C. elegans. While disruption of the mitochondrial fission gene drp-1 only mildly increases wild-type lifespan, it drastically increases the already long lifespan of daf-2 insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) mutants. In this work, we determined the conditions required for drp-1 disruption to extend daf-2 longevity and explored the molecular mechanisms involved. We found that knockdown of drp-1 during development is sufficient to extend daf-2 lifespan, while tissue-specific knockdown of drp-1 in neurons, intestine or muscle failed to increase daf-2 longevity. Disruption of other genes involved in mitochondrial fission also increased daf-2 lifespan as did treatment with a number of different RNAi clones that decrease mitochondrial fragmentation. In exploring potential mechanisms involved, we found that deletion of drp-1 increases resistance to chronic stresses and slows physiologic rates in daf-2 worms. In addition, we found that disruption of drp-1 increased mitochondrial and peroxisomal connectedness in daf-2 worms, increased oxidative phosphorylation and ATP levels, and increased mitophagy in daf-2 worms, but did not affect their ROS levels or mitochondrial membrane potential. Overall, this work defined the conditions under which drp-1 disruption increases daf-2 lifespan and has identified multiple changes in daf-2;drp-1 mutants that may contribute to their lifespan extension.",
