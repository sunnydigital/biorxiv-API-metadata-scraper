    "abstract": "Replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks are harmful lesions preferentially repaired by homologous recombination; a process that requires processing of DNA ends to allow RAD51-mediated strand invasion. End-resection and subsequent repair are two intertwined processes, but the mechanism underlying their execution is still poorly appreciated. The WRN helicase is one of the crucial factors for the end-resection and is instrumental to select the proper repair pathway. Here, we reveal that ordered phosphorylation of WRN by the CDK1, ATM and ATR kinases define a complex regulatory layer that is essential for correct long-range end-resection connecting it to repair by homologous recombination. We establish that long-range end-resection requires an ATM-dependent phosphorylation of WRN at Ser1058 and that phosphorylation at Ser1141, together with dephosphorylation at the CDK1 site Ser1133, is needed for the correct metabolism of RAD51 foci and RAD51-dependent repair. Collectively, our findings suggest that regulation of WRN by multiple kinases functions as molecular switch to allow a timely execution of end-resection and repair at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks.",

    "abstract": "Isw2 proteins are conserved in eukaryotes and are known to bind to DNA and dynamically influence local chromosome condensation close to their DNA binding site in an ATP-dependent manner making genes close to the binding sites more accessible for transcription and repression. A putative MoISW2 gene was deleted with large effects on plant pathogenicity as a result. The gene was complemented and a ChIP-sec was performed to identify binding sites. RNAsec showed effects on the overall regulation of genes along the chromosomes for mutant and background strains and this was compared with RNAseq from 55 downloaded RNA-seq datasets from the same strain and found similar. MoIsw2 binding and activities create genomic regions affected by MoIsw2 with high gene expression variability close to the MoIsw2 binding sites while surrounding regions have lower gene expression variability. The genes affected by the MoIsw2 activity are niche-determinant genes (secreted proteins, secondary metabolites and stress-coping genes) and avirulence genes. We further show that MoIsw2 binding sites with the DNA binding motifs coincide with known transposable elements (TE) making it likely that TE-transposition at the binding sites can affect the transcription profile of M. oryze in a strain-specific manner. We conclude that MoIsw2 is a likely candidate for a master regulator, regulating the dynamic balance between biomass growth genes (like housekeeping genes) and nich-determinant genes important for ecological fitness. Stress-induced TE transposition is together with MoIsw2 activity a likely mechanism creating more mutations and faster evolution of the niche-determinant genes than for housekeeping genes.",

    "abstract": "Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors represent a promising new class of agents that have demonstrated efficacy in treating various cancers, particularly those that carry BRCA1/2 mutations. The cancer associated BRCA1/2 mutations disrupt DNA double strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination (HR). PARP inhibitors (PARPis) have been applied to trigger synthetic lethality in BRCA1/2-mutated cancer cells by promoting the accumulation of toxic DSBs. Unfortunately, resistance to PARPis is common and can occur through multiple mechanisms, including the restoration of HR and/or the stabilization of replication forks. To gain a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying PARPi resistance, we conducted an unbiased CRISPR-pooled genome-wide library screen to identify new genes whose deficiency confers resistance to the PARPi olaparib. Our study revealed that ZNF251, a zinc finger protein, is a novel gene whose haploinsufficiency confers PARPi resistance in multiple breast and ovarian cancer lines harboring BRCA1 mutations. Mechanistically, we discovered that ZNF251 haploinsufficiency leads to constitutive stimulation of RAD51-mediated HR and DNA-PKcs - mediated non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair of DSBs as well as DNA-PKcs-mediated fork protection in BRCA1-mutated cancer cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that RAD51 and DNA-PKcs inhibitors reversed PARPi resistance of ZNF251 haploinsufficient cancer cells harboring BRCA1 mutations. Our findings provide important insights into the mechanisms underlying PARPi resistance and highlight the unexpected role of RAD51 and DNA-PKcs in this phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "Hippocampal replay - the time-compressed, sequential reactivation of ensembles of neurons related to past experience - is a key neural mechanism of memory consolidation. Replay typically coincides with a characteristic pattern of local field potential activity, the sharp-wave ripple (SWR). Reduced SWR rates are associated with cognitive impairment in multiple models of neurodegenerative disease, suggesting that a clinically viable intervention to promote SWRs and replay would prove beneficial. We therefore developed a neurofeedback paradigm for rat subjects in which SWR detection triggered rapid positive feedback in the context of a memory-dependent task. This training protocol increased the prevalence of task-relevant replay during the targeted neurofeedback period by changing the temporal dynamics of SWR occurrence. This increase was also associated with neural and behavioral forms of compensation after the targeted period. These findings reveal short-timescale regulation of SWR generation and demonstrate that neurofeedback is an effective strategy for modulating hippocampal replay.",

By combining the snRNA, snATAC and scRNA sequencing we identify cell types and map these cell types to their locations within the tissue. Unbiased deconvolution of the spatial data identifies 4 distinct spatial microenvironments: glomerular, immune, tubule and fibrotic. We describe the complex, heterogenous cellular and spatial organization of human microenvironments in health and disease. Further, we find that the fibrotic microenvironment spatial gene signature is not only able to molecularly classify human kidneys, but it also offers an improved prognosis prediction compared to traditional histopathological analysis.

    "abstract": "BackgroundCholesteryl ester (CE) accumulation in intracellular lipid droplets (LDs) is an essential signature of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), but its molecular mechanism and pathological significance remain elusive.\n\nMethodsEnabled by the label-free Raman spectromicroscopy, which integrated stimulated Raman scattering microscopy with confocal Raman spectroscopy on the same platform, we quantitatively analyzed LD distribution and composition at the single cell level in intact ccRCC cell and tissue specimens in situ without any processing or exogenous labeling. Since we found that commonly used ccRCC cell lines actually did not show the CE-rich signature, primary cancer cells were isolated from human tissues to retain the lipid signature of ccRCC with CE level as high as the original tissue, which offers a preferable cell model for the study of cholesterol metabolism in ccRCC. Moreover, we established a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse model that retained the CE-rich phenotype of human ccRCC.\n\nFindingsSurprisingly, our results revealed that CE accumulation was induced by tumor suppressor VHL mutation, the most common mutation of ccRCC. Moreover, VHL mutation was found to promote CE accumulation by upregulating HIF and subsequent PI3K/AKT/mTOR/SREBPs pathway. Inspiringly, inhibition of cholesterol esterification remarkably suppressed ccRCC aggressiveness in vitro and in vivo with negligible toxicity, through the reduced membrane cholesterol-mediated downregulations of integrin and MAPK signaling pathways.\n\nInterpretationCollectively, our study improves current understanding of the role of CE accumulation in ccRCC and opens up new opportunities for treatment.\n\nFundingThis work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. U23B2046 and No. 62027824), National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2023YFC2415500), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. YWF-22-L-547), PKU-Baidu Fund (No. 2020BD033), Peking University First Hospital Scientific and Technological Achievement Transformation Incubation Guidance Fund (No.2022CX02), and Beijing Municipal Health Commission (No. 2020-2Z-40713).",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a common phenotype of neurodevelopmental disorders, but how these deficits arise remains elusive. Determining the onset of discrete cognitive capabilities facilitates studies in probing mechanisms underlying their emergence. The present study analyzed the emergence of contextual fear memory persistence (7-day memory retention) and remote memory (30-day memory retention). There was a rapid transition from postnatal day (P) 20 to P21, in which memory persistence emerged in C57Bl/6J male and female mice. Remote memory was present at P23, but expression was not robust compared to pubertal and adult mice. Previous studies reported that following deletion of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase (MET), there are fear memory deficits in adult mice and the timing of critical period plasticity is altered in the developing visual cortex, positioning MET as a regulator for onset of contextual fear memory. Sustaining Met past the normal window of peak cortical expression or deleting Met, however, did not alter the timing of emergence of persistence or remote memory capabilities during development. Fear memory in young adults, however, was disrupted. Remarkably, compared to homecage controls, the number of FOS-expressing infragranular neurons in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) did not increase from contextual memory formation recall of fear conditioning at P35 but exhibited enhanced activation at P90 in male and female mice. Additionally, MET-expressing neurons were preferentially recruited at P90 compared to P35 during fear memory expression. The studies demonstrate a developmental profile of contextual fear memory capabilities. Further, developmental disruption of Met leads to a delayed functional deficit that arises in young adulthood, correlated with an increase of mPFC neuron activation during fear memory recall.",

    "abstract": "RationaleThe resiliency of embryonic development to genetic and environmental perturbations has been long appreciated; however, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the robustness of developmental processes. Aberrations resulting in neonatal lethality are exemplified by congenital heart disease (CHD) arising from defective morphogenesis of pharyngeal arch arteries (PAA) and their derivatives.\n\nObjectiveTo uncover mechanisms underlying the robustness of PAA morphogenesis.\n\nMethods and ResultsThe second heart field (SHF) gives rise to the PAA endothelium. Here, we show that the number of SHF-derived ECs is regulated by VEGFR2 and Tbx1. Remarkably, when SHF-derived EC number is decreased, PAA development can be rescued by the compensatory endothelium. Blocking such compensatory response leads to embryonic demise. To determine the source of compensating ECs and mechanisms regulating their recruitment, we investigated three-dimensional EC connectivity, EC fate, and gene expression. Our studies demonstrate that the expression of VEGFR2 by the SHF is required for the differentiation of SHF-derived cells into PAA ECs. The deletion of one VEGFR2 allele (VEGFR2SHF-HET) reduces SHF contribution to the PAA endothelium, while the deletion of both alleles (VEGFR2SHF-KO) abolishes it. The decrease in SHF-derived ECs in VEGFR2SHF-HET and VEGFR2SHF-KO embryos is complemented by the recruitment of ECs from the nearby veins. Compensatory ECs contribute to PAA derivatives, giving rise to the endothelium of the aortic arch and the ductus in VEGFR2SHF-KO mutants. Blocking the compensatory response in VEGFR2SHF-KO mutants results in embryonic lethality shortly after mid-gestation. The compensatory ECs are absent in Tbx1+/- embryos, a model for 22q11 deletion syndrome, leading to unpredictable arch artery morphogenesis and CHD. Tbx1 regulates the recruitment of the compensatory endothelium in an SHF-non-cell-autonomous manner.\n\nConclusionsOur studies uncover a novel buffering mechanism underlying the resiliency of PAA development and remodeling.\n\nNonstandard Abbreviations and Acronyms in Alphabetical OrderCHD - congenital heart disease; ECs - endothelial cells; IAA-B - interrupted aortic arch type B; PAA - pharyngeal arch arteries; RERSA - retro-esophageal right subclavian artery; SHF - second heart field; VEGFR2 - Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2.",

    "abstract": "In the face of ubiquitous threats from parasites, hosts can evolve strategies to resist infection or to altogether avoid parasitism, for instance by avoiding behavior that could expose them to parasites or by dispersing away from local parasite threats. At the microbial scale, bacteria frequently encounter viral parasites, bacteriophages. While bacteria are known to utilize a number of strategies to resist infection by phages, and can have the capacity to avoid moving towards phage-infected cells, it is unknown whether bacteria can evolve dispersal to escape from phages. In order to answer this question, we combined experimental evolution and mathematical modeling. Experimental evolution of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens in environments with differing spatial distributions of the phage Phi2 revealed that the host bacteria evolved resistance depending on parasite distribution, but did not evolve dispersal to escape parasite infection. Simulations using parameterized mathematical models of bacterial growth and swimming motility showed that this is a general finding: while increased dispersal is adaptive in the absence of parasites, in the presence of parasites that fitness benefit disappears and resistance becomes adaptive, regardless of the spatial distribution of parasites. Together, these experiments suggest that parasites should rarely, if ever, drive the evolution of bacterial escape via dispersal.",

While such errors are eventually fixed in the reference genomes of model organisms, many genomes used by researchers contain these artifacts, and researchers often discard large amounts of data in comparative genomic studies to prevent artifacts from impacting results.

    "abstract": "Paradoxically, cigarette smoking is associated with a reduced risk of Parkinsons disease (PD). This led us to hypothesize that carbon monoxide (CO) levels, which are constitutively but modestly elevated in smokers, might contribute to neuroprotection. Using rodent models of PD based on -synuclein (Syn) accumulation and oxidative stress, we show that low-dose CO mitigates neurodegeneration and reduces Syn pathology. Oral CO administration activated signaling cascades mediated by heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which have been implicated in limiting oxidative stress, and in promoting Syn degradation, thereby conferring neuroprotection. Consistent with a neuroprotective effect of smoking, HO-1 levels in cerebrospinal fluid were higher in human smokers compared to nonsmokers. Moreover, in PD brain samples, HO-1 levels were higher in neurons without Syn pathology. Thus, CO in rodent PD models reduces pathology and increases oxidative stress responses, phenocopying possible protective effects of smoking evident in PD patients. These data highlight the potential for low-dose CO modulated pathways to slow symptom onset and limit pathology in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria play a key role in primary production in both oceans and fresh waters and hold great potential for sustainable production of a large number of commodities. During their life, cyanobacteria cells need to acclimate to a multitude of challenges, including shifts in intensity and quality of incident light. Despite our increasing understanding of metabolic regulation under various light regimes, detailed insight into fitness advantages and limitations under shifting light quality has been missing. Here, we study photo-physiological acclimation in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 through the whole range of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Using LEDs with qualitatively different narrow spectra, we describe wavelength dependence of light capture, electron transport and energy transduction to main cellular pools. In addition, we describe processes fine-tuning light capture such as state transitions and efficiency of energy transfer from phycobilisomes to photosystems. We show that growth was the most limited under blue light due to inefficient light harvesting, and that many cellular processes are tightly linked to the redox state of the PQ pool, which was the most reduced under red light. The PSI-to-PSII ratio was low under blue photons, however, it was not the main growth-limiting factor, since it was even more reduced under violet and near far-red lights, where Synechocystis grew faster compared to blue light. Our results provide insight into the spectral dependence of phototrophic growth and can provide the foundation for future studies of molecular mechanisms underlying light acclimation in cyanobacteria, leading to light optimization in controlled cultivations.",

    "abstract": "A crucial event in sexual reproduction is when haploid sperm and egg fuse to form a new diploid organism at fertilization. In mammals, direct interaction between egg JUNO and sperm IZUMO1 mediates gamete membrane adhesion, yet their role in fusion remains enigmatic. We used AlphaFold to predict the structure of other extracellular proteins essential for fertilization to determine if they could form a complex that may mediate fusion. We first identified TMEM81, whose gene is expressed by mouse and human spermatids, as a protein having structural homologies with both IZUMO1 and another sperm molecule essential for gamete fusion, SPACA6. Using a set of proteins known to be important for fertilization and TMEM81, we then systematically searched for predicted binary interactions using an unguided approach and identified a pentameric complex involving sperm IZUMO1, SPACA6, TMEM81 and egg JUNO, CD9. This complex is structurally consistent with both the expected topology on opposing gamete membranes and the location of predicted N-glycans not modeled by AlphaFold-Multimer, suggesting that its components could organize into a synapse-like assembly at the point of fusion. Finally, the structural modeling approach described here could be more generally useful to gain insights into transient protein complexes difficult to detect experimentally.\n\nImpact statementStructural modeling with AlphaFold-Multimer was used to investigate extracellular protein interactions involved in mammalian egg-sperm recognition, suggesting a putative pentameric complex that includes TMEM81, a sperm protein not previously involved in gamete recognition.",

    "abstract": "A comprehensive census of McrBC systems, among the most common forms of prokaryotic Type IV restriction systems, followed by phylogenetic analysis, reveals their enormous abundance in diverse prokaryotes and a plethora of genomic associations. We focus on a previously uncharacterized branch, which we denote CoCoNuTs (coiled-coil nuclease tandems) for their salient features: the presence of extensive coiled-coil structures and tandem nucleases. The CoCoNuTs alone show extraordinary variety, with 3 distinct types and multiple subtypes. All CoCoNuTs contain domains predicted to interact with translation system components, such as OB-folds resembling the SmpB protein that binds bacterial transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA), YTH-like domains that might recognize methylated tmRNA, tRNA, or rRNA, and RNA-binding Hsp70 chaperone homologs, along with RNases, such as HEPN domains, all suggesting that the CoCoNuTs target RNA. Many CoCoNuTs might additionally target DNA, via McrC nuclease homologs. Additional restriction systems, such as Type I RM, BREX, and Druantia Type III, are frequently encoded in the same predicted superoperons. In many of these superoperons, CoCoNuTs are likely regulated by cyclic nucleotides, possibly, RNA fragments with cyclic termini, that bind associated CARF (CRISPR-Associated Rossmann Fold) domains. We hypothesize that the CoCoNuTs, together with the ancillary restriction factors, employ an echeloned defense strategy analogous to that of Type III CRISPR-Cas systems, in which an immune response eliminating virus DNA and/or RNA is launched first, but then, if it fails, an abortive infection response leading to PCD/dormancy via host RNA cleavage takes over.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRecent reports suggest that amyloid beta (A{beta}) peptides can exhibit prion-like pathogenic properties. Transmission of A{beta} peptide and the development of associated pathologies after surgeries with contaminated instruments and intravenous or intracerebral inoculations have now been reported across fish, rodents, primates, and humans. This raises a worrying prospect of A{beta} peptides also having other characteristics typical of prions, such as evasion of the digestive process. We asked if such transmission of A{beta} aggregates via ingestion was possible.\n\nMethodsWe made use of a transgenic Drosophila melanogaster line expressing human A{beta} peptide prone to aggregation. Fly larvae were fed to adult zebrafish under two feeding schemes. The first was a short-term, high-intensity scheme over 48 hours to determine transmission and retention in the gut. The second, long-term scheme specifically examined retention and accumulation in the brain. The gut and brain tissues were examined by histology, western blotting, and mass spectrometric analyses.\n\nResultsNone of the analyses could detect A{beta} aggregates in the guts of zebrafish following ingestion, despite being easily detectable in the feed. Additionally, there was no detectable accumulation of A{beta} in the brain tissue or development of associated pathologies after prolonged feeding.\n\nConclusionsWhile human A{beta} aggregates do not appear to be readily transmissible by ingestion across species, two prospects remain open. First, this mode of transmission, if occurring, may stay below a detectable threshold and may take much longer to manifest. A second possibility is that the human A{beta} peptide may not be able to trigger self-propagation or aggregation in other species. Either possibility requires further investigation, taking into account the possibility of such transmission from agricultural species used in the food industry.",

    "abstract": "The functions of biomolecular condensates are thought to be influenced by their material properties, and these will be determined by the internal organization of molecules within condensates. However, structural characterizations of condensates are challenging, and rarely reported. Here, we deploy a combination of small angle neutron scattering, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to provide structural descriptions of model condensates that are formed by macromolecules from nucleolar granular components (GCs). We show that these minimal facsimiles of GCs form condensates that are network fluids featuring spatial inhomogeneities across different length scales that reflect the contributions of distinct protein and peptide domains. The network-like inhomogeneous organization is characterized by a coexistence of liquid- and gas-like macromolecular densities that engenders bimodality of internal molecular dynamics. These insights suggest that condensates formed by multivalent proteins share features with network fluids formed by systems such as patchy or hairy colloids.",

    "abstract": "Aggression is ubiquitous among social species and functions to maintains social dominance hierarchies. The African cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni is an ideal study species for studying aggression due to their unique and flexible dominance hierarchy. However, female aggression in this species and the neural mechanisms of aggression in both sexes is not well understood. To further understand the potential sex differences in aggression in this species, we characterized aggression in male and female A. burtoni in a mirror assay. We then quantified neural activation patterns in brain regions of the social behavior network (SBN) to investigate if differences in behavior are reflected in the brain with immunohistochemistry by detecting the phosphorylated ribosome marker phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (pS6), a marker for neural activation. We found that A. burtoni perform both identical and sex-specific aggressive behaviors in response to a mirror assay. We observed sex differences in pS6 immunoreactivity in the Vv, a homolog of the lateral septum in mammals. Males but not females had higher ps6 immunoreactivity in the ATn after the aggression assay. The ATn is a homolog of the ventromedial hypothalamus in mammals, which is strongly implicated in the regulation of aggression in males. Several regions also have higher pS6 immunoreactivity in negative controls than fish exposed to a mirror, implicating a role for inhibitory neurons in suppressing aggression until a relevant stimulus is present. Male and female A. burtoni display both similar and sexually dimorphic behavioral patterns in aggression in response to a mirror assay. There are also sex differences in the corresponding neural activation patterns in the SBN. In mirror males but not females, the ATn clusters with the POA, revealing a functional connectivity of these regions that is triggered in an aggressive context in males. These findings suggest that distinct neural circuitry underlie aggressive behavior in male and female A. burtoni, serving as a foundation for future work investigating the molecular and neural underpinnings of sexually dimorphic behaviors in this species to reveal fundamental insights into understanding aggression.",

    "abstract": "The 40 Hz auditory steady-state response (ASSR), an oscillatory brain response to periodically modulated auditory stimuli, is a promising, non-invasive physiological biomarker for schizophrenia and related neuropsychiatric disorders. The 40 Hz ASSR might be amplified by synaptic interactions in cortical circuits, which are, in turn, disturbed in neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we tested whether the 40 Hz ASSR in human auditory cortex depends on two key synaptic components of neuronal interactions within cortical circuits: excitation via N-methyl-aspartate glutamate (NMDA) receptors and inhibition via gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) receptors. We combined magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings with placebo-controlled, low-dose pharmacological interventions in the same healthy human participants. All participants exhibited a robust 40 Hz ASSR in auditory cortices, especially in the right hemisphere, under placebo. The GABAA receptor-agonist lorazepam increased the amplitude of the 40 Hz ASSR, while no effect was detectable under the NMDA-blocker memantine. Our findings indicate that the 40 Hz ASSR in auditory cortex involves synaptic (and likely intracortical) inhibition via the GABA-A receptor, thus highlighting its utility as a mechanistic signature of cortical circuit dysfunctions involving GABAergic inhibition.\n\nSignificance statementThe 40 Hz auditory steady-state response is a candidate non-invasive biomarker for schizophrenia and related neuropsychiatric disorders. Yet, the understanding of the synaptic basis of this neurophysiological signature in humans has remained incomplete. We combined magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings with placebo-controlled pharmacological interventions in healthy human subjects to test the modulation of the 40 Hz ASSR in auditory cortex by two synaptic components that have been implicated in the generation of neuronal oscillations in cortical microcircuits: glutamate N-methyl-aspartate glutamate (NMDA) receptors and gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) -A receptors. Boosting GABAergic transmission, but not blocking NMDA-receptors, increased the amplitude of this ASSR. Thus, GABAergic inhibition modulates 40 Hz steady-state responses in auditory cortex.",

Brain FC was estimated using the Steady State Visual Evoked Potential-Event Related Partial Coherence (SSVEP-ERPC) methodology. Five twin pairs served twice as participants with an average interval between sessions of 67 days. In each recording session, one twin, the sender, viewed a randomized set of 50 general images and 50 personally relevant images, whilst the other twin, the Receiver, viewed a static personally relevant image for the entire duration of the session. Images appeared on the sender screen for 1.0 sec with the interval between successive images varied randomly between 4.0 and 8.0 sec. Receiver FC changes were calculated from the appearance times of the images as viewed by the Sender. It was hypothesized that anomalous interactions would be indicated by statistically significant Receiver FC changes when those changes are determined using the sender image appearance times. For each twin serving as Receiver, FC components were separately analysed for the 50 general and the 50 personal images, yielding 38 observations (19 twin pairs by 2 conditions). The hypothesis was confirmed in that 12 of the 38 observations, yielded statistically significant receiver FC increases or decreases at the p<0.01 level only when trials were synchronized to the Sender image appearance times. Overall, this effect was significant at the p=4X10-8 Df=175.

    "abstract": "Endosomal-lysosomal trafficking is accompanied by the acidification of endosomal compartments by the H+-V-ATPase to reach low lysosomal pH. Disruption of proper pH impairs lysosomal function and the balance of protein synthesis and degradation (proteostasis). We used the small dipeptide LLOMe, which is known to permeabilize lysosomal membranes, and find that LLOMe also impacts late endosomes (LEs) by neutralizing their pH without causing membrane permeabilization. We show that LLOMe leads to hyper-activation of Rab7 and disruption of tubulation and mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR) recycling on pH-neutralized LEs. Either pH neutralization (NH4Cl) or Rab7 hyper-active mutants alone can phenocopy the alterations in tubulation and CI-M6PR trafficking. Mechanistically, pH neutralization increases the assembly of the V1G1 subunit of the V-ATPase on endosomal membranes, which stabilizes GTP-bound Rab7 via RILP, a known interactor of Rab7 and V1G1. We propose a novel pathway by which V-ATPase and RILP modulate LE pH and Rab7 activation in concert. This pathway might broadly contribute to pH control during physiologic endosomal maturation or starvation and during pathologic pH neutralization, which occurs via lysosomotropic compounds or in disease states.\n\nSummary StatementMulligan et al. show that V-ATPase assembly and RILP mediate hyperactivation of the small GTPase Rab7 when the late endosomal pH gradient collapses disrupting endosome tubulation and M6PR trafficking.",

    "abstract": "The surface of smear-ripened cheeses constitutes a dynamic microbial ecosystem resulting from the successive development of different microbial groups. Recent studies indicate that a viral community, mainly composed of bacteriophages, coexists with cellular microorganisms in this ecosystem, but its ecological significance remains to be elucidated. In this work, we studied a French smear-ripened cheese by both viral metagenomics and 16S metabarcoding approaches to assess both the succession of phages and bacterial communities on the cheese surface on the short-term during the ripening period, and their temporal variations on the long-term in ready-to-eat cheeses over the years of production. We observed a clear transition of the phage community structure during ripening with a decreased relative abundance of viral species (vOTUs) associated with Lactococcus phages, which were replaced by vOTUs associated with phages infecting ripening bacteria such as Brevibacterium, Glutamicibacter, Pseudoalteromonas and Vibrio. The dynamics of the phage community was strongly associated with bacterial successions observed on the cheese surface. Finally, while some variations in the distribution of phages were observed in ready-to-eat cheeses produced at different dates spanning more than 4 years of production, a core of abundant vOTUs was systematically detected. This result revealed the long-term persistence of the main phages in the cheese production environment. Together, these findings offer novel perspectives on the ecology of bacteriophages in smear-ripened cheese and emphasize the significance of incorporating bacteriophages in the microbial ecology studies of fermented foods.\n\nIMPORTANCESmear-ripened cheeses are microbial ecosystems made up of various microorganisms including bacteria, yeasts and also viruses such as bacteriophages, which infect and regulate bacterial populations. In this work, a French smear-ripened cheese was used to study how these viruses and bacteria interact over time in both the short-term during cheese production, and the long-term across several years of production. It revealed that the composition of the bacteriophage community shifts during the ripening process, aligning with the bacterial successions observed on the cheese surface between lactic acid bacteria and ripening bacteria. Additionally, the main bacteriophages were found consistently in cheese products made over a 4-years period, showing that they represent a persistent component of the cheese-making environment. This research highlights the importance of considering these bacteriophages when studying the microbial life of fermented foods like cheese.",

    "abstract": "T cells in the human female genital tract (FGT)2 are key mediators of susceptibility to and protection from infection, including HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. There is a critical need for increased understanding of the distribution and activation of T cell populations in the FGT, but current sampling methods require a healthcare provider and are expensive, limiting the ability to study these populations longitudinally. To address these challenges, we have developed a method to sample immune cells from the FGT utilizing disposable menstrual discs which are non-invasive, self-applied, and low-cost. To demonstrate reproducibility, we sampled the cervicovaginal fluid (CVF)3 of healthy, reproductive-aged individuals using menstrual discs over three sequential days. CVF was processed for cervicovaginal cells, and high parameter flow cytometry was used to characterize immune populations. We identified large numbers of live, CD45+ leukocytes, as well as distinct populations of T cells and B cells. Within the T cell compartment, activation and suppression status of T cell subsets were consistent with previous studies of the FGT utilizing current approaches, including identification of both tissue resident and migratory populations. In addition, the T cell population structure was highly conserved across days within individuals but divergent across individuals. Our approach to sample immune cells in the FGT with menstrual discs will decrease barriers to participation and empower longitudinal sampling in future research studies.",

    "abstract": "Designing novel proteins tailored for specific purposes (e.g. drug discovery, vaccine design) presents a promising approach to address various biomedical challenges. Due to the similarity between protein sequences and natural languages, motivated by the remarkable success in NLP tasks that pre-trained language models have enabled text generation with human-like capabilities, protein language models (ProtLMs) are constructed to generate protein sequences with a predictable function across large protein families. The text generation can be controllable by constructing prefix-phase as control tags to prompt NLP language models. However, the vocabulary of protein sequences only contains 20 amino acid residues, which is not like natural language vocabulary to make up flexible control tags. In this study, we propose a controllable protein design method, named PrefixProt, which utilizes prefix tuning to learn virtual tokens as control tags, enabling to efficiently prompt the pre-trained ProtLM for protein generation tailored for specific purposes. The virtual tokens can be learned on any protein properties by data-driven and are flexible to be combined for fine-grained control. To demonstrate the effectiveness of PrefixProt, we train three virtual tokens on alpha-helix structure dataset, antimicrobial peptide (AMP) dataset and anticancer peptide (ACP) dataset, respectively. Our results show that prefix virtual tokens are efficient to prompt the pretrained ProtLM by optimizing fewer trainable parameters compared with fine-tuning, especially under low-data settings. When combining the virtual tokens, the proportion of generated proteins with multiple properties are significantly improved. Therefore, PrefixProt offers a flexible and controllable protein design solution. We anticipate that PrefixProt will contribute to drug discovery and biomedical advancement.\n\nAvailability and implementationThe models and associated code are available at: https://github.com/chen-bioinfo/PrefixProt",

    "abstract": "To elucidate the primary factors shaping mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutagenesis, we derived a comprehensive 192-component mtDNA mutational spectrum using 86,149 polymorphic synonymous mutations reconstructed from the CytB gene of 967 chordate species. The mtDNA spectrum analysis provided numerous findings on repair and mutation processes, breaking it down into three main signatures: (i) symmetrical, evenly distributed across both strands, mutations, induced by gamma DNA polymerase (about 50% of all mutations); (ii) asymmetrical, heavy-strand-specific, C>T mutations (about 30%); and (iii) asymmetrical, heavy-strand-specific A>G mutations, influenced by metabolic and age-specific factors (about 20%). We propose that both asymmetrical signatures are driven by single-strand specific damage coupled with inefficient base excision repair on the lagging (heavy) strand of mtDNA. Understanding the detailed mechanisms of this damage is crucial for developing strategies to reduce somatic mtDNA mutational load, which is vital for combating age-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "AbstractBacteria form groups comprised of cells and secreted adhesive matrix that controls their spatial organization. These groups - termed biofilms - can act as refuges from environmental disturbance and from biotic threats, including phages. Despite the ubiquity of temperate phages and bacterial biofilms, temperate phage propagation within biofilms has never been characterized on multicellular spatial scales. Here, we leverage several approaches to track temperate phages and distinguish between lytic and lysogenic infections. We determine that lysogeny within E. coli biofilms most often occurs within a predictable region of cell group architecture. Because lysogens are generally found on the periphery of large groups, where lytic viral activity also reduces local structural integrity, lysogens are predisposed to disperse and are over-represented in biofilms formed downstream of the original biofilm-phage system. Comparing our results with those for virulent phages reveals that the temperate phages possess previously unknown advantages for propagation in architecturally heterogeneous biofilm communities.",

In this study, using a transgenic mouse model overexpressing 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24), an enzyme in the sterol biosynthesis pathway responsible for the conversion of desmosterol to cholesterol, we show that disruption of sterol homeostasis during spermatogenesis led to defective sperm morphology characterized by incomplete mitochondrial packing in the midpiece, reduced sperm count and motility, and a decline in male fertility with increasing paternal age, without changes in body fat composition. Sperm depleted of desmosterol exhibit inefficiency in the acrosome reaction, metabolic dysfunction, and an inability to fertilize the egg.

    "abstract": "Whole-genome shotgun (WGS) metagenomic sequencing of microbial communities allows us to discover the functions, physiologies, and evolutionary histories of microbial prokaryote and eukaryote members of diverse ecosystems. Despite their importance, metagenomic studies of microbial eukaryotes lag behind those of prokaryotes, due to the difficulty in identifying and assembling high-quality eukaryotic genomes from WGS data. To address this problem, we have developed Eukfinder, a bioinformatics pipeline that recovers and assembles nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of eukaryotic microbes from WGS metagenomics data. As part of its workflow, it utilizes two specialized databases to classify reads based on taxonomy which can be customized to the dataset or environment of interest. We applied Eukfinder to human gut microbiome WGS metagenomic sequencing data to recover genomes from the protistan parasite Blastocystis sp., a highly prevalent colonizer of the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals. We tested Eukfinder using both a series of simulated gut microbiome datasets, which included varying numbers of Blastocystis reads combined with bacterial reads and by using real metagenomic gut samples containing Blastocystis. We compared the results of Eukfinder with other published workflows. With sufficient reads, Eukfinder efficiently assembles high-quality near-complete nuclear and mitochondrial genomes from diverse Blastocystis subtypes from metagenomic data without the aid of a reference genome. Furthermore, with sufficient depth of sequence sampling, Eukfinder outperforms similar tools used to recover eukaryotic genomes from metagenomic data. Eukfinder will be a useful tool for reference-independent and cultivation-free study of eukaryotic microbial genomes from environmental metagenomic sequencing samples.\n\nIMPORTANCERapid advancements in next-generation sequencing technologies have made whole-genome shotgun (WGS) metagenomic sequencing an efficient method for de novo reconstruction of microbial genomes from samples taken from different environments. So far, thousands of new prokaryotic genomes have been characterized from strains or species that were unknown to science. However, the relatively large size and complexity of protistan genomes has, until recently, precluded the use of the WGS metagenomic approach to sample microbial eukaryotic diversity. The bioinformatics pipeline we developed, Eukfinder, can recover eukaryotic microbial genomes from environmental WGS metagenomic samples. By retrieving high-quality protistan genomes from diverse metagenomic samples, we can increase numbers of reference genomes available to aid future metagenomic investigations into the functions, physiologies, and evolutionary histories of eukaryotic microbes in the gut microbiome and a variety of other ecosystems.",

Our fascin crossbridge structure reveals an asymmetric F-actin binding conformation that is allosterically blocked by the inhibitor G2. Reconstructions of seven-filament hexagonal bundle elements, variability analysis, and simulations show how structural plasticity enables fascin to bridge varied inter-filament orientations, accommodating mismatches between F-actins helical symmetry and bundle hexagonal packing. Tomography of many-filament bundles and modeling uncovers geometric rules underlying emergent fascin binding patterns, as well as the accumulation of unfavorable crosslinks that limit bundle size.

    "abstract": "Throughout the tree of life RNA-binding proteins play important roles, but they are poorly characterized in cyanobacteria. Structural prediction suggests an RNA-binding interface for the protein YlxR/Ssr1238 in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803. Two pairs of cysteine residues are arranged as possibly coordinating an Fe-S cluster and appear widely conserved in the homologous proteins of other cyanobacteria. Overexpression of Ssr1238 for 24 h led to higher levels of RNase P RNA, tRNAs, and stress-related mRNAs. Co-immunoprecipitation of proteins followed by MS analysis and sequencing of UV crosslinked, co-immunoprecipitated RNA samples identified potential interaction partners of Ssr1238. The most enriched transcript was RNase P RNA, and RnpA, the protein component of RNase P, was among the most highly enriched proteins. A second highly enriched transcript derived from gene ssl3177, which encodes a central enzyme in cell wall remodeling during cell division. The data also showed a strong connection to the RNA maturation and modification system indicated by co-precipitation of RNA modifying enzymes, riboendonuclease E and enolase. Surprisingly, cyanophycin synthetase and urease were highly enriched as well. In conclusion, Ssr1238 specifically binds to two different transcripts and participates in the coordination of RNA maturation, translation, cell division, and aspects of nitrogen metabolism. Our results are consistent with recent findings that the B. subtilis YlxR protein functions as an RNase P modulator (RnpM), but suggest additional functionalities and extend its proposed role to the phylum cyanobacteria.",

We have analyzed the identities and interactions of T-cells in PD in post-mortem brain tissue using single nucleus RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics and T-cell receptor sequencing. We found that T-cells in the substantia nigra of PD brain donors exhibit a CD8+ resident memory phenotype, increased clonal expansion, and altered spatial relationships with astrocytes, myeloid cells, and endothelial cells. We also describe regional differences in astrocytic responses to neurodegeneration. Our findings nominate potential molecular and cellular candidates that allow a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of neurodegeneration in PD.

    "abstract": "Lenia, a cellular automata framework used in artificial life, provides a natural setting to design, implement, and analyze mathematical models of cancer progression and treatment. Lenias suitability as a cancer model is derived from the strong parallels between artificial life and cancer evolution: morphogenesis, homeostasis, motility, reproduction, growth, stimuli response, evolvability, and adaptation. Historically, agent-based models of cancer progression have been constructed with rules that govern birth, death and migration based on local availability for space, with attempts to map local rules to emergent global growth dynamics. In contrast, Lenia provides a flexible framework for considering a spectrum of local (cell-scale) to global (tumor-scale) dynamics by defining an interaction kernel governing density-dependent growth dynamics. First, we show Lenia can recapitulate a range of cancer model classifications including local or global, deterministic or stochastic, non-spatial or spatial, single or multi-population, and off or on-lattice. Lenia is subsequently used to develop data-informed models of 1) single-population growth dynamics, 2) multi-population cell-cell competition models, and 3) cell migration or chemotaxis. Mathematical modeling provides several important mechanistic insights into tumor-immune interactions. First, we find that short-range interaction kernels provide a mechanism for tumor cell survival under conditions for strong Allee effects. Next, we find that asymmetric interaction tumor-immune kernels lead to poor immune response and alter the the spatial variegation of tumor density. Finally, modeling recapitulates immune-ECM interactions where patterns of collagen formation evolve as a mechanism of immune escape, leading to an inverse relationship between disease stage and immune coverage.",

However, their role in disease pathobiology and contribution to the lesion environment remains unclear.\n\nBy establishing directly induced neural stem/progenitor cell (iNSC) lines from PMS patient fibroblasts, we studied their senescent phenotype in vitro. Senescence was strongly associated with inflammatory signaling, hypermetabolism, and the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP). PMS-derived iNSCs displayed increased glucose-dependent fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis, which resulted in the accumulation of cholesteryl ester-enriched lipid droplets. An HMG-CoA reductase-mediated lipogenic state was found to induce secretion of the SASP in PMS iNSC conditioned media via transcriptional regulation by cholesterol-dependent transcription factors. SASP from PMS iNSCs induced neurotoxicity. Chemical targeting of HMG-CoA reductase using the cholesterol-lowering drug simvastatin (SV) prevented SASP release and resulting neurotoxicity.\n\nOur findings suggest a disease-associated, cholesterol-related, hypermetabolic phenotype of PMS iNSCs that leads to neurotoxic signaling and is rescuable pharmacologically.",

We find increased neural activity at the time an expected, but omitted, stimulus would have occurred but no significant prediction error responses following an unexpected stimulus substitution. Sequence representations became sparser and less correlated with training, although these changes had no effect on decoding accuracy of stimulus identity or timing. Additionally, we find that experience modifies the temporal structure of stimulus responses to produce a bias towards predictive stimulus-locked activity.

Here, we examine site-specific differential nuclear DNA (nDNA) methylation and differential gene expression resulting from in vitro reduction of mtDNA-CN to uncover shared genes and biological pathways mediating the effect of mtDNA-CN on disease. Epigenome and transcriptome profiles were generated for three independent human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cell lines harbouring a mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) heterozygous knockout generated via CRISPR-Cas9, and matched control lines. We identified 4,242 differentially methylated sites, 228 differentially methylated regions, and 179 differentially expressed genes associated with mtDNA-CN. Integrated analysis uncovered 381 Gene-CpG pairs. GABAA receptor genes and related pathways, the neuroactive ligand receptor interaction pathway, ABCD1/2 gene activity, and cell signalling processes were overrepresented, providing insight into the underlying biological mechanisms facilitating these associations. We also report evidence implicating chromatin state regulatory mechanisms as modulators of mtDNA-CN effect on gene expression. We demonstrate that mitochondrial DNA variation signals to the nuclear DNA epigenome and transcriptome and may lead to nuclear remodelling relevant to development, aging, and complex disease.",

    "abstract": "The cyst wall of the eye pathogen Acanthamoeba castellanii contains cellulose and chitin and has ectocyst and endocyst layers connected by conical ostioles. Previously, we used mass spectrometry of purified walls to identify an abundant laccase and three families of lectins (Jonah, Luke, and Leo). Here we show that frameshifts in the protein prediction in AmoebaDB, which incorrectly add 12 transmembrane helices, cause Jonah to mislocalize to a ring around ostioles rather than to the ectocyst layer. RT-PCR, double labels with GFP and RFP or mCherry, and promoter swaps show that ectocyst localization does not just correlate with but is caused by earlier expression, while localization in the endocyst layer and ostioles is caused by later expression. A chitin-binding domain from an Entamoeba chitinase shows chitin forms thick fibrils in the ectocyst layer and a honeycomb in the endocyst layer. AlphaFold shows Ac wall proteins originate from bacteria by horizontal gene transfer ({beta}-helical folds of Jonah and three cupredoxin-like domains of the laccase), share common ancestry with wall proteins of slime molds ({beta}-jelly-roll folds of Luke), or are unique to Acanthamoeba (four disulfide knots of Leo). Ala mutations show linear arrays of aromatic amino acids in {beta}-jelly-roll folds of Luke and disulfide knots of Leo are necessary for binding cellulose and proper localization of proteins in the cyst wall. Finally, rabbit antibodies to recombinant Jonah, Luke, Leo, and laccase efficiently detect calcoflour white-labeled cysts of 10 of 11 Acanthamoeba isolates tested, suggesting all four proteins are excellent diagnostic targets.\n\nIMPORTANCEAcanthamoebae are free-living amoeba in the soil and water that cause Acanthamoeba keratitis in under-resourced countries, where water for washing hands may be scarce. Acanthamoeba is an emerging pathogen in the United States, because of its association with contact lens use. Here we show early expression during encystation causes a Jonah lectin and a laccase to localize to the outer layer of the cyst wall, while later expression cause Luke and Leo lectins to localize to the inner layer and the conical ostioles that connect the layers. We used structural predictions to identify the aromatic amino acids of Luke and Leo necessary for binding cellulose in the wall and to identify domains of Jonah and laccase useful for making recombinant proteins to immunize rabbits. Rabbit antibodies to Jonah, Luke, Leo, and laccase all efficiently detected cysts of ten Acanthamoeba isolates, including five T4 genotypes that cause most keratitis cases.",

    "abstract": "Tissue development, function, and disease are largely driven by the spatial organization of individual cells and their cell-cell interactions. Precision engineered tissues with single-cell spatial resolution, therefore, have tremendous potential for next generation disease models, drug discovery, and regenerative therapeutics. Despite significant advancements in biofabrication approaches to improve feature resolution, strategies to fabricate tissues with the exact same organization of individual cells in their native cellular microenvironment have remained virtually non-existent to date. Here we report a method to spatially pattern single cells with up to eight cell phenotypes and subcellular spatial precision. As proof-of-concept we first demonstrate the ability to systematically assess the influence of cellular microenvironments on cell behavior by controllably altering the spatial arrangement of cell types in bioprinted precision cell-cell interaction arrays. We then demonstrate, for the first time, the ability to produce high-fidelity replicas of a patients annotated cancer biopsy with subcellular resolution. The ability to replicate native cellular microenvironments marks a significant advancement for precision biofabricated in-vitro models, where heterogenous tissues can be engineered with single-cell spatial precision to advance our understanding of complex biological systems in a controlled and systematic manner.",

    "abstract": "Homologous recombination (HR) deficiency enhances sensitivity to DNA damaging agents commonly used to treat cancer. In HR-proficient cancers, metabolic mechanisms driving response or resistance to DNA damaging agents remain unclear. Here we identified that depletion of alpha-ketoglutarate (KG) sensitizes HR-proficient cells to DNA damaging agents by metabolic regulation of histone acetylation. KG is required for the activity of KG-dependent dioxygenases (KGDDs), and prior work has shown that changes in KGDD affect demethylases. Using a targeted CRISPR knockout library consisting of 64 KGDDs, we discovered that Trimethyllysine Hydroxylase Epsilon (TMLHE), the first and rate-limiting enzyme in de novo carnitine synthesis, is necessary for proliferation of HR-proficient cells in the presence of DNA damaging agents. Unexpectedly, KG-mediated TMLHE-dependent carnitine synthesis was required for histone acetylation, while histone methylation was affected but dispensable. The increase in histone acetylation via KG-dependent carnitine synthesis promoted HR-mediated DNA repair through site- and substrate-specific histone acetylation. These data demonstrate for the first time that HR-proficiency is mediated through KG directly influencing histone acetylation via carnitine synthesis and provide a metabolic avenue to induce HR-deficiency and sensitivity to DNA damaging agents.",

    "abstract": "A range of genome maintenance factors respond to endogenous and exogenous DNA damage to prevent mutations and cell death. The scaffold protein, Rtt107, is important for the growth of cells exposed to DNA-damaging agents in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Rtt107 binds to a diverse array of partner proteins, such as Slx4, and responds to DNA damage by localizing to phosphorylated histone H2A. Rad55-Rad57, a heterodimer involved in DNA repair, also binds to Rtt107, but the function of the Rtt107-Rad55-Rad57 complex remains unclear. In addition to their sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, rtt107{Delta} mutants exhibit spontaneous genome instability phenotypes, including spontaneous loss of heterozygosity (LOH) caused by crossovers and other genetic events. However, the binding partners with which Rtt107 interacts to prevent spontaneous genome instability have yet to be elucidated. Here, we showed that Rtt107 acts in the same pathway as Rad55 to limit LOH, specifically by preventing crossover events. A rad55-S404A phosphorylation site mutation largely disrupted the interaction between Rtt107 and Rad55-Rad57, resulting in increased LOH and crossover rates, consistent with the contribution of Rtt107-Rad55-Rad57 interaction to genome stability. Strikingly, an rtt107-K887M mutation that reduces Rtt107 recruitment to H2A did not result in an LOH phenotype, suggesting that the role of Rtt107 in preventing LOH is distinct from its function as an H2A-binding scaffold. Rtt107 did not function primarily in the same pathway as Rad55 to limit recombination at the sensitive ribosomal DNA (rDNA) locus, but instead acted with Slx4 to maintain rDNA stability, suggesting that interactions of Rtt107 with different partners prevented distinct types of instability. Taken together, our observations suggested that Rtt107 limits spontaneous LOH and crossover events in part by binding to Rad55 in a manner dependent on Rad55-S404.\n\nAuthor SummaryNumerous proteins are involved in the repair of damaged DNA and prevention of genome instability in cells, which would otherwise result in persistent changes to DNA. Genome maintenance pathways are evolutionarily conserved, and the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is a powerful model organism for investigating the maintenance of genome integrity. Rtt107 is a scaffold protein expressed in yeast, containing conserved protein domains that are important for the function of genome maintenance proteins. Although the functions of Rtt107 in cells treated with DNA-damaging agents have been characterized in some detail, it remains unclear how Rtt107 prevents spontaneous genome instability in cells growing under normal conditions. Here, we found that Rtt107 prevents specific types of spontaneous genome instability and acts in the same pathway as the DNA repair protein, Rad55, to which it binds. Mutation of a possible Rtt107 binding site on Rad55 showed that Rtt107 indeed limited genome instability in part by binding to Rad55. Strikingly, Rtt107 also showed Rad55-independent roles in preventing ribosomal DNA (rDNA) instability, and in this context Rtt107 cooperated in part with its binding partner Slx4. Taken together, our results revealed the pathways by which the evolutionarily conserved protein Rtt107 limits spontaneous genome instability.",

    "abstract": "Diffuse midline gliomas (DMG) are aggressive and fatal pediatric tumors of the central nervous system that are highly resistant to treatments. Lysine to methionine substitution of residue 27 on histone H3 (H3-K27M) is a driver mutation in DMGs, reshaping the epigenetic landscape of these cells to promote tumorigenesis. H3-K27M gliomas are characterized by deregulation of histone acetylation and methylation pathways, as well as the oncogenic MYC pathway. In search of effective treatment, we examined the therapeutic potential of dual targeting of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and MYC in these tumors. Treatment of H3-K27M patient-derived cells with Sulfopin, an inhibitor shown to block MYC-driven tumors in-vivo, in combination with the HDAC inhibitor Vorinostat, resulted in substantial decrease in cell viability. Moreover, transcriptome and epigenome profiling revealed synergistic effect of this drug combination in downregulation of prominent oncogenic pathways such as mTOR. Finally, in-vivo studies of patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models showed significant tumor growth reduction in mice treated with the drug combination. These results highlight the combined treatment with PIN1 and HDAC inhibitors as a promising therapeutic approach for these aggressive tumors.",

    "abstract": "Since the first novel gene discovery for a Mendelian condition was made via exome sequencing (ES), the rapid increase in the number of genes known to underlie Mendelian conditions coupled with the adoption of exome (and more recently, genome) sequencing by diagnostic testing labs has changed the landscape of genomic testing for rare disease. Specifically, many individuals suspected to have a Mendelian condition are now routinely offered clinical ES. This commonly results in a precise genetic diagnosis but frequently overlooks the identification of novel candidate genes. Such candidates are also less likely to be identified in the absence of large-scale gene discovery research programs. Accordingly, clinical laboratories have both the opportunity, and some might argue a responsibility, to contribute to novel gene discovery which should in turn increase the diagnostic yield for many conditions. However, clinical diagnostic laboratories must necessarily balance priorities for throughput, turnaround time, cost efficiency, clinician preferences, and regulatory constraints, and often do not have the infrastructure or resources to effectively participate in either clinical translational or basic genome science research efforts. For these and other reasons, many laboratories have historically refrained from broadly sharing potentially pathogenic variants in novel genes via networks like Matchmaker Exchange, much less reporting such results to ordering providers. Efforts to report such results are further complicated by a lack of guidelines for clinical reporting and interpretation of variants in novel candidate genes. Nevertheless, there are myriad benefits for many stakeholders, including patients/families, clinicians, researchers, if clinical laboratories systematically and routinely identify, share, and report novel candidate genes. To facilitate this change in practice, we developed criteria for triaging, sharing, and reporting novel candidate genes that are most likely to be promptly validated as underlying a Mendelian condition and translated to use in clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "The inferior colliculus (IC), the midbrain auditory integration center, analyzes information about social vocalizations and provides substrates for higher level processing of vocal signals. We used multi-channel recordings to characterize and localize responses to social vocalizations and synthetic stimuli within the IC of female and male mice, both urethane-anesthetized and unanesthetized. We compared responses to ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) with other vocalizations in the mouse repertoire and related vocal responses to frequency tuning, IC subdivisions, and sex. Responses to lower frequency, broadband social vocalizations were widespread in IC, well represented throughout the tonotopic axis, across subdivisions, and in both sexes. Responses to USVs were much more limited. Although we observed some differences in tonal and vocal responses by sex and subdivision, representations of vocal responses by sex and subdivision were largely the same. For most units, responses to vocal signals occurred only when frequency response areas overlapped with spectra of the vocal signals. Since tuning to frequencies contained within the highest frequency USVs is limited (< 15% of IC units), responses to these vocalizations are correspondingly limited (< 5% of sound-responsive units). These results highlight a paradox of USV processing in some rodents: although USVs are the most abundant social vocalization, their representation and the representation of corresponding frequencies is less than lower frequency social vocalizations. We interpret this paradox in light of observations suggesting that USVs with lower frequency elements (<50 kHz) are associated with increased emotional intensity and engage a larger population of neurons in the mouse auditory system.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe inferior colliculus (IC) integrates multiple inputs to analyze information about social vocalizations. In mice, we show that the most common type of social vocalization, the ultrasonic vocalization or USV, was poorly represented in IC compared to lower frequency vocalizations.

    "abstract": "Background and ObjectivesInterthalamic adhesion (IA), also known as the massa intermedia, is a structure that connects the median borders of both thalami across the third ventricle. Given it is difficult to identify on routine neuroimaging, its anatomical variants and function remain poorly studied. The main objective of this study was to clarify the role of IA on cognition. Our main hypothesis was that thalamus stroke patients with an IA would show better performance on neuropsychological tests than individuals without an IA through possible compensatory mechanisms.\n\nMethodsThe study comprised a group of healthy subjects and a cohort of patients with isolated thalamic strokes at the chronic stage. All participants underwent 3T research T1w and FLAIR MRI as well as a neuropsychological assessment. The presence or absence of an IA and type of IA anatomical variant were evaluated by two independent reviewers.\n\nResults42 healthy subjects (mean age= 49) and 40 patients (mean age= 51) were finally included. 76% of participants had an IA, with a higher prevalence among women (92%) than men (61%). The presence or absence of an IA did not effect the neuropsychological performance of healthy subjects nor did the type of IA variant. Across all the tests, patients with an IA (n = 18) showed the lowest BF10 (157) while those without an IA (n = 10) exhibited the highest BF10 (10648) when compared to healthy subjects using a Bayesian rmANOVA. More specifically, patients without an IA performed more poorly in the verbal memory or Stroop task versus healthy subjects than patients with an IA. This effect was not explained by age, laterality of the infarct, volume or, localization of the lesion. Patients with an IA and lesions extending into the IA presented a similar trend to non-IA subjects which could however be explained by a greater volume of lesions.\n\nDiscussionIA does not appear to have a major role in cognition for healthy subjects but could play a compensatory part in patients with thalamic lesions.",

    "abstract": "During mitosis, the Bub1-Bub3 complex concentrates at kinetochores, the microtubule-coupling interfaces on chromosomes, where it contributes to spindle checkpoint activation, kinetochore-spindle microtubule interactions, and protection of centromeric cohesion. Bub1 has a conserved N-terminal tetratricopeptide (TPR) domain followed by a binding motif for its conserved interactor Bub3. The current model for Bub1-Bub3 localization to kinetochores is that Bub3, along with its bound motif from Bub1, recognizes phosphorylated \"MELT\" motifs in the kinetochore scaffold protein Knl1. Motivated by the greater phenotypic severity of BUB-1 versus BUB-3 loss in C. elegans, we show that the BUB-1 TPR domain directly recognizes a distinct class of phosphorylated motifs in KNL-1 and that this interaction is essential for BUB-1-BUB-3 localization and function. BUB-3 recognition of phospho-MELT motifs additively contributes to drive super-stoichiometric accumulation of BUB-1-BUB-3 on its KNL-1 scaffold during mitotic entry. Bub1s TPR domain interacts with Knl1 in other species, suggesting that collaboration of TPR-dependent and Bub3-dependent interfaces in Bub1-Bub3 localization and functions may be conserved.",

    "abstract": "The PP2A-B55 phosphatase regulates a plethora of signaling pathways throughout eukaryotes. How PP2A-B55 selects its substrates presents a severe knowledge gap. By integrating AlphaFold modelling with comprehensive high resolution mutational scanning, we show that -helices in substrates bind B55 through an evolutionary conserved mechanism. Despite a large diversity in sequence and composition, these -helices share key amino acid determinants that engage discrete hydrophobic and electrostatic patches. Using deep learning protein design, we generate a specific and potent competitive peptide inhibitor of PP2A-B55 substrate interactions. With this inhibitor, we uncover that PP2A-B55 regulates the nuclear exosome targeting complex by binding to an -helical recruitment module in RBM7. Collectively, our findings provide a framework for the understanding and interrogation of PP2A-B55 in health and disease.\n\nOne sentence summary-helices in PP2A-B55 substrates bind a conserved pocket on B55 through a common mechanism that is conserved in eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "A bipolar spindle composed of microtubules and many associated proteins functions to segregate chromosomes during cell division in all eukaryotes, yet spindle size and architecture varies dramatically across different species and cell types. Targeting protein for Xklp2 (TPX2) is one candidate factor for modulating spindle microtubule organization through its roles in branching microtubule nucleation, activation of the mitotic kinase Aurora A, and association with the kinesin-5 (Eg5) motor. Here we identify a conserved nuclear localization sequence (NLS) motif, 123KKLK126 in X. laevis TPX2, which regulates astral microtubule formation and spindle pole morphology in Xenopus egg extracts. Addition of recombinant TPX2 with this sequence mutated to AALA dramatically increased spontaneous formation of microtubule asters and recruitment of phosphorylated Aurora A, pericentrin, and Eg5 to meiotic spindle poles. We propose that TPX2 is a linchpin spindle assembly factor whose regulation contributes to the recruitment and activation of multiple microtubule polymerizing and organizing proteins, generating distinct spindle architectures.",

    "abstract": "Activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) is one of three endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane stress sensors that mediate the unfolded protein response (UPR). Despite its crucial role in long-term ER stress adaptation, regulation of ATF6 alpha () signalling remains poorly understood, possibly because its activation involves ER-to-Golgi and nuclear trafficking. Here, we generated an ATF6/IRE1 dual UPR reporter CHO-K1 cell line and performed an unbiased genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis screen to systematically profile genetic factors that specifically contribute to ATF6 signalling in the presence and absence of ER stress. The screen identified both anticipated and new candidate genes that regulate ATF6 activation. Among these, calreticulin (CRT), a key ER luminal chaperone, selectively repressed ATF6 signalling: Cells lacking CRT constitutively activated a BiP::sfGFP ATF6-dependent reporter, had higher BiP levels and an increased rate of trafficking and processing of ATF6. Purified CRT interacted with the luminal domain of ATF6 in vitro and the two proteins co-immunoprecipitated from cell lysates. CRT depletion exposed a negative feedback loop implicating ATF6 in repressing IRE1 activity basally and overexpression of CRT reversed this repression. Our findings indicate that CRT, beyond its known role as a chaperone, also serves as an ER repressor of ATF6 to selectively regulate one arm of the UPR.",

    "abstract": "While protein homeostasis is a hallmark of gene regulation, unraveling the hidden regulatory mechanisms that maintain homeostasis is difficult using traditional methods. To confront this problem, we CRISPR engineered a human cell line with multiple tags in the endogenous MYH9 gene, which encodes the essential and ubiquitous myosin-2A cytoskeletal motor. Using these cells, we imaged MYH9 transcription, translation, and mature mRNA and protein in distinct colors, enabling a full dissection of the central dogma. Our data show that MYH9 transcription is upregulated in an SRF-dependent manner in response to cytoskeletal cues and that MYH9 translation can either buffer or match the transcriptional response depending on context. Upon knockdown of actin-depolymerizing proteins like cofilin, translation efficiency drops by a factor of two to buffer strong transcriptional upregulation, likely to help prevent excessive myosin activity. In contrast, following serum stimulation, translation matches the transcriptional response to readily reestablish steady state. Our results identify contextual translational buffering as an important regulatory mechanism driving stable MYH9 expression. They also demonstrate the power and broad applicability of our cell line, which can now be used to accurately quantify central dogma dynamics in response to diverse forms of cellular perturbations.",

    "abstract": "A popular strategy for therapeutic delivery to cells and tissues is to encapsulate therapeutics inside particles that cells internalize via endocytosis. The efficacy of particle uptake by endocytosis is often studied in bulk using flow cytometry and Western blot analysis and confirmed using confocal microscopy. However, these techniques do not reveal the detailed dynamics of particle internalization and how the inherent heterogeneity of many types of particles may impact their endocytic uptake. Toward addressing these gaps, here we present a live-cell imaging-based method that utilizes total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to track the uptake of a large ensemble of individual particles in parallel, as they interact with the cellular endocytic machinery. To analyze the resulting data, we employ an open-source tracking algorithm in combination with custom data filters. This analysis reveals the dynamic interactions between particles and endocytic structures, which determine the probability of particle uptake. In particular, our approach can be used to examine how variations in the physical properties of particles (size, targeting, rigidity), as well as heterogeneity within the particle population, impact endocytic uptake. These data impact the design of particles toward more selective and efficient delivery of therapeutics to cells.",

To understand the conformational basis of this diversity, we assessed the conformation of the common GluN1 subunit in receptors with different GluN2 subunits using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET). We established smFRET sensors in the ligand binding domain and modulatory amino-terminal domain to study an apo-like state and partially liganded activation intermediates, which have been elusive to structural analysis. Our results demonstrate a strong, subtype- specific influence of apo and glutamate-bound GluN2 subunits on GluN1 rearrangements, suggesting a conformational basis for the highly divergent levels of receptor activity, desensitization and agonist potency. Chimeric analysis reveals structural determinants that contribute to the subtype differences.

    "abstract": "Many microorganisms are capable of anaerobic respiration in the absence of oxygen, by using different organic compounds as terminal acceptors in electron transport chain. We identify here an anaerobic respiratory chain protein responsible for acrylate reduction in the marine bacterium Shewanella woodyi. When the periplasmic proteins of S. woodyi were separated by ion exchange chromatography, acrylate reductase activity copurified with an ArdA protein (Swoo_0275). Heterologous expression of S. woodyi ardA gene (swoo_0275) in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 cells did not result in the appearance in them of periplasmic acrylate reductase activity, but such activity was detected when the ardA gene was co-expressed with an ardB gene (swoo_0276). Together, these genes encode flavocytochrome c ArdAB, which is thus responsible for acrylate reduction in S. woodyi cells. ArdAB was highly specific for acrylate as substrate and reduced only methacrylate (at a 22-fold lower rate) among a series of other tested 2-enoates. In line with these findings, acrylate and methacrylate induced ardA gene expression in S. woodyi under anaerobic conditions, which was accompanied by the appearance of periplasmic acrylate reductase activity. ArdAB-linked acrylate reduction supports dimethylsulfoniopropionate-dependent anaerobic respiration in S. woodyi and, possibly, other marine bacteria.",

    "abstract": "The decomposition of a biomolecular complex into domains is an important step to investigate biological functions and ease structure determination. A successful approach to do so is the SPECTRUS algorithm, which provides a segmentation based on spectral clustering applied to a graph coding interatomic fluctuations derived from an elastic network model. We present SPECTRUS++ , which makes three straightforward and useful additions to SPECTRUS. For single structures, we show that high quality partitionings can be obtained from a graph Laplacian derived from pairwise interactions--without normal modes. For sets of homologous structures, we introduce a Multiple Sequence Alignment mode, exploiting both the sequence based information (MSA) and the geometric information embodied in experimental structures. Finally, we propose to analyse the clusters/domains delivered using the so-called D-family-matching algorithm, which establishes a correspondence between domains yielded by two decompositions, and can be used to handle fragmentation issues.

    "abstract": "The decomposition of a biomolecular complex into domains is an important step to investigate biological functions and ease structure determination. A successful approach to do so is the SPECTRUS algorithm, which provides a segmentation based on spectral clustering applied to a graph coding interatomic fluctuations derived from an elastic network model. We present SPECTRUS++ , which makes three straightforward and useful additions to SPECTRUS. For single structures, we show that high quality partitionings can be obtained from a graph Laplacian derived from pairwise interactions--without normal modes. For sets of homologous structures, we introduce a Multiple Sequence Alignment mode, exploiting both the sequence based information (MSA) and the geometric information embodied in experimental structures. Finally, we propose to analyse the clusters/domains delivered using the so-called D-family-matching algorithm, which establishes a correspondence between domains yielded by two decompositions, and can be used to handle fragmentation issues. Our domains compare favorably to those of the original SPECTRUS, and those of the deep learning based method Chainsaw.

    "abstract": "Understanding binding epitopes involved in protein-protein interactions and accurately determining their structure is a long standing goal with broad applicability in industry and biomedicine. Although various experimental methods for binding epitope determination exist, these approaches are typically low throughput and cost intensive. Computational methods have potential to accelerate epitope predictions, however, recently developed artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods frequently fail to predict epitopes of synthetic binding domains with few natural homologs. Here we have developed an integrated method employing generalized-correlation-based dynamic network analysis on multiple molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories, initiated from AlphaFold2 Multimer structures, to unravel the structure and binding epitope of the therapeutic PD-L1:Affibody complex. Both AlphaFold2 and conventional molecular dynamics trajectory analysis alone each proved ineffectual in differentiating between two putative binding models referred to as parallel and perpendicular. However, our integrated approach based on dynamic network analysis showed that the perpendicular mode was significantly more stable. These predictions were validated using a suite of experimental epitope mapping protocols including cross linking mass spectrometry and next-generation sequencing-based deep mutational scanning. Our research highlights the potential of deploying dynamic network analysis to refine AI-based structure predictions for precise predictions of protein-protein interaction interfaces.",

We observed a marked reduction in transitional to follicular B cell development in CTLA4-deficient patients, correlating with decreased CTLA4 function in regulatory T cells and increased mTORC1 signaling in transitional B cells. Treatment of transitional B cells with CD40L was sufficient to induce mTORC1 signaling and inhibit follicular B cell maturation in vitro. Frequent cell-cell contacts between CD40L+ T cells and naive IgD+CD27- B cells were observed in patient lymph nodes. Follicular B cell maturation in CTLA-deficient patients was partially rescued following CTLA4 replacement therapy in vivo. We conclude that functional regulatory T cells and the containment of excessive T cell activation are required for follicular B cells to mature and attain metabolic quiescence and thus acquire a state of immunological self-tolerance.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryCongenital T cell activation in CTLA4-deficient patients impairs transitional to follicular B cell maturation and can be rescued by CTLA4 replacement therapy in vivo.",

    "abstract": "The macrolide antibiotic, macrolactin A (McA), has been known for its antimicrobial properties since the late 1980s, but the mechanism of its antibacterial activity is still unknown. In this study, we investigated the microbiological and molecular characteristics of McA antimicrobial activity. McA effect on bacteria was found to be both bacteriostatic and bactericidal, depending on species and strains. Regarding the mechanism of action of McA, the following important results were obtained: 1) using in vivo and in vitro systems, we showed that McA is an inhibitor of protein synthesis in bacteria; 2) the concentration of McA required to inhibit protein synthesis in the E. coli cell-free model was found to be 50 times lower than the concentration required in the S. aureus cell-free model; 3) the toe-printing assay revealed that McA inhibits the first step of elongation stage of protein synthesis; 4) we identified single and multiple nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene encoding the translation elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) by annotating the genomes of McA-resistant Bacillus pumilus McAR and its parental strain. Molecular modeling showed that the McA molecule can form non-covalent bonds with amino acids at the interface of domains 1 and 2 of EF-Tu, characterized by a relatively high docking score. Overall, our study demonstrated that McA acts as an elfamycin-like antibiotic (targeting EF-Tu), addressing a substantial gap in our understanding of the mechanism of action of macrolactin A, a representative member of macrolides.",

    "abstract": "Sarbecoviruses exhibit varying abilities in using angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor1-3. However, a comprehensive understanding of their multi-species ACE2 adaptiveness and the underlying mechanism remains elusive, particularly for many sarbecoviruses with various receptor binding motif (RBM) insertions/deletions (indels)4-11. Here, we analyzed RBM sequences from 268 sarbecoviruses categorized into four RBM indel types. We extensively examined the capability of 14 representative sarbecoviruses and their derivatives in using ACE2 orthologues from 51 bats and five non-bat mammals. We revealed that most sarbecoviruses with longer RBMs (type-I), present broad ACE2 tropism, whereas viruses with single deletions in Region 1 (type-II) or Region 2 (type-III) generally exhibit narrow ACE2 tropism, typically favoring their hosts ACE2. Sarbecoviruses with double region deletions (type-IV) exhibit a complete loss of ACE2 usage. Subsequent investigations unveiled that both loop deletions and critical RBM residues significantly impact multi-species ACE2 tropism in different ways. Additionally, fine mapping based on type-IV sarbecoviruses elucidated the role of several clade-specific residues, both within and outside the RBM, in restricting ACE2 usage. Lastly, we hypothesized the evolution of sarbecovirus RBM indels and illustrated how loop length, disulfide, and adaptive mutations shape their multi-species ACE2 adaptiveness. This study provides profound insights into the mechanisms governing ACE2 usage and spillover risks of sarbecoviruses.",

    "abstract": "Infection outcomes can be strongly context-dependent, shifting a host-symbiont relationship along a parasitism-mutualism continuum. Numerous studies show that under stressful conditions, symbionts that are typically mutualistic can become parasitic. The reverse possibility - a parasite becoming mutualistic - has received much less study. We investigated whether the parasitic microsporidium Ordospora pajunii can become beneficial for its host Daphnia dentifera in the presence of the more virulent fungal pathogen Metschnikowia bicuspidata. We found that, even though infection with O. pajunii reduces the frequency of penetration of M. bicuspidata spores into the host body cavity, it does not improve the survival or reproduction of the host; conversely, coinfection increased the mortality of Daphnia. However, the shorter lifespan of coinfected hosts disrupted the life cycle of M. bicuspidata, greatly reducing its fitness. Thus, coinfection with both pathogens was detrimental to the host at the individual level, but might be beneficial for the host population as a result of greatly reduced production of M. bicuspidata spores. If so, this would mean that O. pajunii outbreaks should delay or prevent M. bicuspidata outbreaks. In support of this, in an analysis of dynamics of naturally occurring outbreaks in two lakes where these pathogens co-occur, we found a time lag in occurrence between O. pajunii and M. bicuspidata, with M. bicuspidata epidemics only occurring after the collapse of O. pajunii epidemics. Thus, these results suggest that the interaction between co-occurring symbionts - and the net impact of a symbiont on a host - might be qualitatively different at different scales.\n\nImportanceUnderstanding the factors that modify infection probability and virulence is crucial for identifying the drivers of infection outbreaks and modeling disease epidemic progression, and increases our ability to control diseases and reduce the harm they cause. One factor that can strongly influence infection probability and virulence is the presence of other pathogens. However, while coexposures and coinfections are incredibly common, we still have only a limited understanding of how pathogen interactions alter infection outcomes, or whether their impacts are scale-dependent. We used a system of one host and two pathogens to show that sequential coinfection can have a tremendous impact on the host and on the infecting pathogens, and that the outcome of (co-)infection can be negative or positive depending on the focal organization level.",

In this study, we use Nanostring technology to investigate in vivo IOP-related gene responses in the trabecular meshwork (TM) and optic nerve head (ONH) simultaneously from the same animals.\n\nMethodsMale and female rats (N=35) were subject to CEI for 8-hours at pressures simulating mean, daytime normotensive rat IOP (CEI-20), or 2.5x IOP (CEI-50). Naive animals, receiving no anesthesia or surgical interventions, served as controls. Immediately after CEI, TM and ONH tissues were dissected, RNA isolated, and samples were analyzed with a Nanostring panel containing 770 genes. Post-processing, raw count data were uploaded to Rosalind(R) for differential gene expression analyses.\n\nResultsFor the TM, 45 IOP-related genes were significant in the \"CEI-50 vs. CEI-20\" and \"CEI-50 vs. naive\" comparisons, with 15 genes common to both comparisons. Bioinformatics analysis identified Notch and TGF{beta} pathways to be the most up- and down-regulated KEGG pathways, respectively. For ONH, 22 significantly regulated genes were identified in the \"CEI-50 vs. naive\" comparison. Pathway analysis identified  defense response and  immune response as two significantly upregulated biological process pathways.\n\nConclusionsThis study demonstrates the ability to assay IOP-responsive genes in both TM and ONH tissues simultaneously. In the TM, downregulation of TGF{beta} pathway genes suggest that TM responses may prevent TGF{beta}-induced extracellular matrix synthesis. For ONH, the initial response to elevated IOP may be protective, with astrocytes playing a key role in these gene responses.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a devastating disease characterized by obliterative vascular remodeling and persistent increase of vascular resistance, leading to right heart failure and premature death. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms will help develop novel therapeutic approaches for PAH patients. Recent studies showed that FABP4 and FABP5 were expressed in ECs across multiple tissues and circulating FABP4 level was elevated in the PAH patients. However, the role of endothelial FABP4/5 in the pathogenesis of PAH remains undetermined.\n\nMethodsFABP4/5 expression was examined in pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (PAECs) and lung tissues from patients with idiopathic PAH (IPAH) and pulmonary hypertension (PH) rat models. Plasma proteome analysis was performed in human PAH samples. Echocardiography, hemodynamics, histology, and immunostaining were performed to evaluate the lung and heart PH phenotypes in Egln1Tie2Cre (CKO) mice and Egln1Tie2Cre/Fabp4-5-/- (TKO) mice. Bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis were performed to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of endothelial FABP4/5 mediated PAH pathogenesis.\n\nResultsBoth FABP4 and FABP5 were highly induced in ECs of CKO mice and PAECs from IPAH patients, and in whole lungs of PH rats. Plasma levels of FABP4/5 were upregulated in IPAH patients and directly correlated with severity of hemodynamics and biochemical parameters. Genetic deletion of both Fabp4 and 5 in CKO mice caused a reduction of right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and RV hypertrophy, attenuated pulmonary vascular remodeling and prevented the right heart failure. Fabp4/5 deletion also normalized EC glycolysis, reduced ROS and HIF-2 expression, and decreased aberrant EC proliferation in CKO lungs.\n\nConclusionsPH causes aberrant expression of FABP4/5 in pulmonary ECs which leads to enhanced ECs glycolysis and hyperproliferation, contributing to the accumulation of arterial ECs and vascular remodeling and exacerbating the disease.",

    "abstract": "MotivationUnderstanding structural properties of k-mer multisets is crucial to designing space-efficient indices to query them. A potentially novel source of structure can be found in the rank function of a k-mer multiset. In particular, the rank function of a k-mer multiset can be approximated by a piece-wise linear function with very few segments. Such an approximation was shown to speed up suffix array queries and sequence alignment. However, a more comprehensive study of the structure of rank functions of k-mer multisets and their potential applications is lacking.\n\nResultsWe study a measure of a k-mer multiset complexity, which we call the PLA-complexity. The PLA-complexity is the number of segments necessary to approximate the rank function of a k-mer multiset with a piece-wise linear function so that the maximum error is bounded by a predefined threshold. We describe, implement, and evaluate the PLA-index, which is able to construct, compact, and query a piece-wise linear approximation of the k-mer rank function. We examine the PLA-complexity of more than 500 genome spectra and several other genomic multisets. Finally, we show how the PLA-index can be applied to several downstream applications to improve on existing methods: speeding up suffix array queries, decreasing the index memory of a short-read aligner, and decreasing the space of a direct access table of k-mer ranks.\n\nAvailabilityThe software and reproducibility information is freely available at https://github.com/medvedevgroup/pla-index",

    "abstract": "In silico toxicity prediction offers the chance of reducing or replacing most animal testing through the integration of large experimental assay datasets with the appropriate computational approaches. The use of Cell Painting to detect various phenotypic changes induced by chemicals is emerging as a powerful technique in toxicity prediction. However, most Cell Painting approaches use cancer cells that are less relevant for many toxicological endpoints, which may limit the usefulness of this data. In this study, a myoblast cell line is used to characterize cellular responses to a panel of 30 known myotoxicants. In place of traditional structural descriptors, here each perturbation is described by a fingerprint of calculated properties, deducted from the intensity, shape, or texture of individual cells. We show that these kinds of descriptors convey information to allow the prediction of the cellular viability and fate of cells in myoblasts and differentiated myotubes of the C2C12 cell line, and the clustering of drugs by their cytotoxicity responses.\n\nAuthor SummaryStudying the toxicity of chemical compounds and drugs is crucial to avoid potentially lethal adverse effects of commercialized products, but also to detect the unsuspected toxicity of existing drugs. While these assays traditionally rely on animal models raising important ethical concerns, a need for in vitro and in silico models is present and increasing in recent years. We here propose a predictive model capable of predicting the values of a cell viability assay using cell morphology profiles captured with a microscopy experiment. This model predicts the healthiness of muscle cells treated with 30 compounds suspected to induce muscular damage or even myopathies in humans. We also use these profiles to find an interesting morphological similarity between two different classes of drugs: statins (used for cholesterol treatments) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (anti-cancer drugs). This analysis opens a new perspective for understanding the mechanisms responsible for drug-induced muscular toxicity, an area of toxicology that is currently under-researched.",

    "abstract": "Circular RNA (circRNA) is a class of RNA molecules that forms a closed loop with its 5 and 3 ends covalently bonded. Due to this specific structure circRNAs are more stable than linear RNAs, admit distinct biological properties and functions, and have been proven to be promising biomarkers. Circular RNAs were severely overlooked previously owing to the biases in the RNA-seq protocols and in the detection algorithms, but recently gained tremendous attentions in both aspects. However, most existing methods for assembling circRNAs heavily rely on the annotated transcriptomes, and hence exhibit unsatisfactory accuracy when a high-quality transcriptome is unavailable. Here we present TERRACE, a new algorithm for full-length assembly of circRNAs from paired-end total RNA-seq data. TERRACE uses the splice graph as the underlying data structure to organize the splicing and coverage information. We transform the problem of assembling circRNAs into finding two paths that \"bridge\" the three fragments in the splice graph induced by back-spliced reads. To solve this formulation, we adopted a definition for optimal bridging paths and a dynamic programming algorithm to calculate such paths, an approach that was proven useful for assembling linear RNAs. TERRACE features an efficient algorithm to detect back-spliced reads that are missed by RNA-seq aligners, contributing to its much improved sensitivity. It also incorporates a new machine-learning approach that is trained to assign a confidence score to each assembled circRNA, which is shown superior to using abundance for scoring. TERRACE is compared with leading circRNA detection methods on both simulations and biological datasets. Our method consistently outperforms by a large margin in sensitivity while maintaining better or comparable precision. In particular, when the annotations are not provided, TERRACE can assemble 123%-412% more correct circRNAs than state-of-the-art methods on human tissues. TERRACE presents a major leap on assembling full-length circRNAs from RNA-seq data, and we expect it to be widely used in the downstream research on circRNAs.",

    "abstract": "The tumour suppressor p14/19ARF regulates ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis by controlling the nucleolar localization of Transcription Termination Factor 1 (TTF1). However, the role played by TTF1 in regulating the rRNA genes and in potentially controlling growth has remained unclear. We now show that TTF1 expression regulates cell growth by determining the cellular complement of ribosomes. Unexpectedly, it achieves this by acting as a \"roadblock\" to synthesis of the non-coding LncRNA and pRNA that we show are generated from the \"Spacer Promoter\" duplications present upstream of the 47S pre-rRNA promoter on the mouse and human ribosomal RNA genes. Unexpectedly, the endogenous generation of these non-coding RNAs does not induce CpG methylation or gene silencing. Rather, it acts in cis to suppress 47S preinitiation complex formation and hence de novo pre-rRNA synthesis by a mechanism reminiscent of promoter interference or occlusion. Taken together, our data delineate a pathway from p19ARF to cell growth suppression via the regulation of ribosome biogenesis by non-coding RNAs and validate a key cellular growth law in mammalian cells.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas13 nucleases are programmable RNA-targeting effectors that can silence gene expression in a reversible manner. Recent iterations of Cas13 nucleases are compact for adeno-associated virus (AAV) delivery to achieve strong and persistent expression in various organs in a safe manner. Here, we report significant transcriptomic signatures of Cas13bt3 expression and show all-in-one AAV gene therapy with Cas13bt3 can effectively silence VEGFA in human retinal organoids and humanised mouse models. Specifically, human embryonic stem cells (hESC)-derived retinal pigment epithelium cells show high expression of Cas13bt3 from virus delivery corresponding to significant reduction of VEGFA mRNA. We further show that intravitreal delivery of Cas13bt3 can transduce mouse retinal cells efficiently, reaching the photoreceptors for specific knockdown of human VEGFA in the trVEGF029 (Kimba) mouse. Our results reveal important considerations for assessing Cas13 activity and establishing Cas13bt3 as a potential anti-VEGF agent that can achieve long-term control of VEGFA for treatment of diabetic retinopathy and wet age-related macular degeneration.",
