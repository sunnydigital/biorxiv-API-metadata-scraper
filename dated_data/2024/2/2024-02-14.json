    "abstract": "Recent work has shown the fundamental role that cognitive strategies play in visuomotor adaptation. While algorithmic strategies, such as mental rotation, are flexible and generalizable, they are computationally demanding. To avoid this computational cost, people can instead rely on memory retrieval of a previously successful strategy. However, they are likely subject to strict stimulus-response associations and rely heavily on working memory capacity. In the current work, we sought to reveal the constraints of retrieval strategies in visuomotor adaptation. In a series of five experiments, we sought to estimate the working memory capacity limitations of retrieval strategies for visuomotor adaptation. This was accomplished by leveraging different variations of visuomotor item-recognition and visuomotor rotation recall tasks where we associated unique rotations with specific targets in the workspace and manipulated the set size (i.e., number of rotation-target associations). Notably, from Experiment 1 to 4, we found key signatures of working memory retrieval and not mental rotation. In particular, participants were less accurate and slower for larger set sizes. Importantly, we estimated that participants capacity in our experiments was between 2-5 targets across experiments. In addition, we found clear recency effects where reaching movements were more accurate and faster for more recent items. These results were corroborated using model-based metrics from a Bayesian latent-mixture analysis over target error distributions. Finally, in Experiment 5, we showed how the constraints observed across Experiments 1 to 4 can be overcome when relying on long-term memory retrieval. Our results point to the opportunity of studying other sources of memories where visuomotor solutions can be stored (e.g., episodic memories) to achieve successful adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Plants must cope with a variety of stressors during their life cycle, and the adaptive responses to these environmental cues involve all cellular organelles. Among them, comparatively little is known about the contribution of cytosolic lipid droplets (LDs) and their core set of neutral lipids and associated surface proteins to the rewiring of cellular processes in response to stress. Here, we analyzed the changes that occur in the lipidome and proteome of Arabidopsis leaves after pathogen infection with Botrytis cinerea or Pseudomonas syringae, or after heat stress. Analyses were carried out in wild-type plants and the oil-rich double mutant tgd1-1 sdp1-4 that allowed for an allied study of the LD proteome in stressed leaves. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based methods, we show that a hyperaccumulation of the primary LD core lipid triacylglycerol is a general response to stress and that acyl chain and sterol composition are remodeled during cellular adaptation. Likewise, comparative analysis of the LD protein composition in stress-treated leaves highlighted the plasticity of the LD proteome as part of the general stress response. We further identified at least two additional LD-associated proteins, whose localization to LDs in leaves was confirmed by confocal microscopy of fluorescent protein fusions. Taken together, these results highlight LDs as dynamic contributors to the cellular adaptation processes that underlie how plants respond to environmental stress.\n\nOne sentence summaryBiotic and heat stress strongly alters the lipidome and proteome of Arabidopsis leaves including the proteome of lipid droplets.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTIsoprene, a volatile hydrocarbon, is typically emitted from the leaves and other aboveground plant organs; isoprene emission from roots is not well studied. Given its well-known function in plant growth and defense aboveground, isoprene may also be involved in shaping root physiology to resist belowground stress. We used isoprene-emitting transgenic lines (IE) and a non-emitting empty vector and/or wild type lines (NE) of Arabidopsis to elucidate the roles of isoprene in root physiology and salt stress resistance. We assessed root phenotype and metabolic changes, hormone biosynthesis and signaling, and stress-responses under normal and saline conditions of IE and NE lines. We also analyzed the root transcriptome in the presence or absence of salt stress. IE lines emitted isoprene from roots, which was associated with higher primary root growth, root biomass, and root/shoot biomass ratio under both control and salt stress conditions. Transcriptome data indicated that isoprene altered the expression of key genes involved in hormone metabolism and plant responses to stress factors. Our findings reveal that root constitutive isoprene emission sustains root growth also under salinity by regulating and/or priming hormone biosynthesis and signaling mechanisms, amino acids biosynthesis, and expression of key genes relevant to salt stress defense.",

    "abstract": "The cell wall of plants and algae is an important cell structure that protects cells from changes in the external physical and chemical environment. This extracellular matrix composed of polysaccharides and glycoproteins, is needed to be remodeled continuously throughout the life cycle. However, compared to matrix polysaccharides, little is known about the mechanisms regulating the formation and degradation of matrix glycoproteins. We report here that a plant kinase belonging to the dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase (DYRK) family present in all eukaryotes regulates cell wall degradation in the model microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by inducing the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In the absence of DYRKP, daughter cells fail to degrade the parental cell wall, and form multicellular structures. On the other hand, the complementation line of DYRKP was shown to degrade the parental cell wall normally. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses indicate a marked down-regulation of MMP expression in the dyrkp mutants. Additionally, the expression of MMP was confirmed to be consistent with the expression pattern of DYRKP. Our findings show that DYRKP, by ensuring timely MMP expression, enables the successful execution of the cell cycle. Altogether, this study provides new insight into the life cycle regulation in plants and algae.\n\nIN A NUTSHELLO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSPlants and algae have different types of polysaccharides in their cell walls, but they have glycoproteins in common. Glycoprotein synthesis and degradation must be tightly regulated to ensure normal growth and differentiation. However, little is known about the regulatory mechanism of glycoprotein degradation in both plants and algae. The cell cycle of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii begins anew with the hatching of daughter cells, and the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is known to be important in this process. In our previous study, we observed that a knockout mutant of the plant kinase belonging to the dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase (DYRKP) formed a palmelloid structure and failed to hatch.\n\nQuestionsWhat is the role of DYRKP in microalgae? Specifically, why does the dyrkp mutant form a palmelloid structure? Palmelloid is usually observed in dividing cells or after exposure to stresses. We therefore hypothesized that the palmelloid phenotype observed in dyrkp mutant could either be due to a defect in cell hatching or due to an increased stress state in the mutant population.\n\nFindingsWe answered these questions by comparative studies in different culture conditions and by examining additional dyrkp knockout mutants generated by CRISPR-Cas9 in various background strains with more or less intact cell walls. Palmelloid formation in the dyrkp mutant was observed under optimal growth (mixo- or auto-trophic condition) and very low light conditions. Interestingly, unlike the parent strain, in which only cell wall fragments are observed in old cultures, the parental cell wall of the dyrkp mutant remained almost intact even after the release of daughter cells. Also, the cell division rate of the cell wall-less dyrkp mutants was similar to their background strain. These results suggest that dyrkp mutants have a problem in degrading the parental cell walls. Indeed, proteomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed reduced levels of protease families in the dyrkp mutant, and in particular with a significantly lower amount of several key members of the MMP family. Through the analysis of complementation lines, we confirmed that the DYRKP was required for strong and rapid expression of MMPs.\n\nNext stepsWe are pursuing research to understand what the phosphorylation clients of DYRKP are and how they regulate the expression of the MMPs identified in this study.\n\nOne sentence summaryThe DYRKP kinase induces the expression of matrix metalloproteinases involved in the degradation of the parental cell wall, allowing prompt hatching of daughter cells after cell division.",

    "abstract": "Identification of accurate biomarkers is still particularly urgent for improving the poor survival of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. In this investigation, we aimed to identity the potential biomarkers in COPD via bioinformatics and next generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis. In this investigation, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in COPD were identified using NGS dataset (GSE239897) from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Subsequently, gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis was conducted to evaluate the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in progression of COPD. Protein-protein interaction (PPI), modules, miRNA-hub gene regulatory network and TF-hub gene regulatory network analysis were performed to determine the hub genes, miRNAs and TFs. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to determine the diagnostic value of hub genes. A total of 956 overlapping DEGs (478 up regulated and 478 down regulated genes) were identified in the NGS dataset. DEGs were mainly associated with GO functional terms and pathways in cellular response to stimulus. response to stimulus, immune system and neutrophil degranulation. There were 10 hub genes (MYC, LMNA, VCAM1, MAPK6, DDX3X, SHMT2, PHGDH, S100A9, FKBP5 and RPS6KA2) identified by PPI, modules, miRNA-hub gene regulatory network and TF-hub gene regulatory network analysis. In conclusion, the DEGs, relative GO terms, pathways and hub genes identified in the present investigation might aid in understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying COPD progression and provide potential molecular targets and biomarkers for COPD.",

    "abstract": "Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most fatal form of lung cancer. Intra-tumoral heterogeneity, marked by neuroendocrine (NE) and non-neuroendocrine (non-NE) cell states, defines SCLC, but the drivers of SCLC plasticity are poorly understood. To map the landscape of SCLC tumor microenvironment (TME), we applied spatially resolved transcriptomics and quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics to metastatic SCLC tumors obtained via rapid autopsy. The phenotype and overall composition of non-malignant cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) exhibits substantial variability, closely mirroring the tumor phenotype, suggesting TME-driven reprogramming of NE cell states. We identify cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) as a crucial element of SCLC TME heterogeneity, contributing to immune exclusion, and predicting an exceptionally poor prognosis. Together, our work provides the first comprehensive map of SCLC tumor and TME ecosystems, emphasizing their pivotal role in SCLCs adaptable nature, opening possibilities for re-programming the intercellular communications that shape SCLC tumor states.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/579028v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (74K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13fdf41org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5a44d7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5dbe02org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@659444_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Centrosomes are membrane-less organelles that orchestrate a wide array of biological functions by acting as microtubule organizing centers. Recently, the centrosome has been implicated in caspase-1 activation and inflammasome-driven pyroptosis. Here, we report that caspase-2-driven apoptosis is elicited in blood cells that fail cytokinesis and that extra centrosomes are necessary to trigger this cell death. Activation of caspase-2 depends on the PIDDosome multi-protein complex and priming of PIDD1 at extra centrosomes is critical for this signalling pathway. Accordingly, loss of its centrosomal adapter, ANKRD26, allows for cell survival and unrestricted polyploidization in response to cytokinesis failure. Mechanistically, cell death is initiated upstream of mitochondria and caspase-9 via caspase-2-mediated processing of the proapoptotic BCL2 family protein BID, driving BAX/BAK-dependent mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). Remarkably, BID-deficient cells enforce apoptosis by engaging a p53-dependent pro-apoptotic transcriptional response initiated by caspase-2. Consistently, MDM2 and BID act as shared caspase-2 substrates that synergize to promote cell killing. Our findings document that the centrosome limits its own unscheduled duplication by the induction of PIDDosome-driven mitochondrial apoptosis to avoid potentially pathogenic polyploidization events.",

    "abstract": "Ciliopathies are often caused by defects in the ciliary microtubule core. Glutamylation is abundant in cilia, and its dysregulation may contribute to ciliopathies and neurodegeneration. Mutation of the deglutamylase CCP1 causes infantile-onset neurodegeneration. In C. elegans, ccpp-1 loss causes age-related ciliary degradation that is suppressed by mutation in the conserved NEK10 homolog nekl-4. NEKL-4 is absent from cilia, yet negatively regulates ciliary stability via an unknown, glutamylation-independent mechanism. We show that NEKL-4 was mitochondria-associated. nekl-4 mutants had longer mitochondria, a higher baseline mitochondrial oxidation state, and suppressed ccpp-1 mutant lifespan extension in response to oxidative stress. A kinase-dead nekl-4(KD) mutant ectopically localized to ccpp-1 cilia and rescued degenerating microtubule doublet B-tubules. A nondegradable nekl-4(PEST{Delta}) mutant resembled the ccpp-1 mutant with dye filling defects and B-tubule breaks. The nekl-4(PEST{Delta}) Dyf phenotype was suppressed by mutation in the depolymerizing kinesin-8 KLP-13/KIF19A. We conclude that NEKL-4 influences ciliary stability by activating ciliary kinesins and promoting mitochondrial homeostasis.\n\nSummaryNeurodegeneration and ciliary degeneration are caused by mutation of the deglutamylase CCP1/CCPP-1 in humans and C. elegans.

    "abstract": "Sustained attention is important for optimal neurobehavioral performance, but many biological and environmental factors (e.g., circadian rhythm, distraction, etc.) may cause sustained attention deficits. It has been suggested that mastication (chewing) may ameliorate such deficits. As part of a continuing program to study the effects of mastication under varying conditions of fatigue and cognitive demand, this trial used a randomized, within-subjects, cross-over design to investigate the effect of mastication (gum chewing) on levels of sustained attention. To initially provide data that was ecologically valid for the average person, participants were not sleep deprived or otherwise challenged. Fifty-eight healthy adults (aged 18 - 45 years; 38 females) completed a 5 h in-laboratory daytime study during which time they completed two, 40 min test bouts. Participants completed the Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT), the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART), the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). During one of the two test bouts, participants were instructed to chew a piece of gum at a steady, comfortable rate. The statistical analyses were conducted blind. The primary outcome variable used for analyses was PVT lapses using the transformation square root of lapses plus square root of lapses plus 1 in addition to PVT mean reciprocal response time. Secondary outcome variables were PVT time-on-task slope and SART error score. Using rested participants and moderately fatiguing tasks, we were unable to detect any significant improvement in PVT or SART performance, or in KSS or PANAS ratings. A follow-up study under conditions of sleep deprivation and/or with longer task duration may provide further insight into the countermeasure potential of mastication.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) measures the excitability and inhibition of corticomotor networks. Despite its task-specificity, few studies have used TMS during dynamic movements and the reliability of TMS-derived measures has not been assessed during cycling. This study aimed to evaluate the reliability of motor evoked potentials (MEP) and short- and long-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI and LICI) on vastus lateralis and rectus femoris muscle activity during a fatiguing single-leg cycling task. Nine healthy adults (2 females) performed two identical sessions of counterweighted single-leg cycling at 60% peak power output until failure. Five single-pulses and five short- and long-interval paired pulses delivered to the motor cortex, and two maximal femoral nerve stimulations [maximal M-wave (Mmax)], were delivered during two baseline cycling bouts (unfatigued) and every 5 min throughout cycling (fatigued). When comparing both baseline bouts within the same session, MEP{middle dot}Mmax-1 and LICI (both ICC: >0.9) were rated excellent while SICI was rated good (ICC: 0.7-0.9). At baseline between sessions, in the vastus lateralis, Mmax (ICC: >0.9) and MEP{middle dot}Mmax-1 (ICC: 0.7) demonstrated good reliability, LICI was moderate (ICC: 0.5), and SICI was poor (ICC: 0.3). Across the fatiguing task, Mmax demonstrated excellent reliability (ICC >0.8), MEP{middle dot}Mmax-1 ranged good to excellent (ICC: 0.7-0.9), LICI was moderate to excellent (ICC: 0.5-0.9), and SICI remained poorly reliable (ICC: 0.3-0.6). Overall, these results corroborate the cruciality of retaining mode-specific testing measurements and suggest that during cycling, Mmax, MEP{middle dot}Mmax-1, and LICI measures are reliable whereas SICI, although less reliable across days, can be reliable within the same session.",

    "abstract": "MHC-II presents antigenic peptides to T helper cells, thus shaping adaptive immune responses. Peptide loading of MHC-II in endosomes is shaped by the susceptibility of the peptide-MHC-II complex to dissociation by the catalyst HLA-DM. For a given MHC-II allotype, experimental data reveal an enormous range of HLA-DM susceptibilities of different peptides - more than five orders of magnitude. To understand the underlying mechanisms, we develop a coarse-grained kinetic model and confront it with experimental data. The model explains the observed variation of HLA-DM susceptibility with the peptide-MHC-II binding energy by an allosteric competition mechanism. Paradoxically, however, certain peptides are resistant to dissociation by HLA-DM regardless of their binding energy. Our model predicts that this resistance is linked with fast peptide association to MHC-II in the absence of HLA-DM. In sum, our data-based theoretical analysis identifies two distinct molecular mechanisms that shape antigen presentation by MHC-II.",

    "abstract": "ContextInformal seed trade can exacerbate crop disease epidemics. Potato production across Ethiopia is threatened by the spread of seedborne pests and pathogens, particularly by bacterial wilt, caused by the Ralstonia solanacearum Species Complex (RSSC). The RSSC is commonly dispersed through informal trade of seed potato, with the potential to move long distances across Ethiopia and among trading countries. Efficient disease testing programs and formal seed systems can reduce the risk of disease expansion in a countrys potato cropping system.\n\nObjectiveIn this study, we characterized networks of potato value chain actors. We also identified candidate locations for disease surveillance and management interventions for improved seed systems, and locations at high risk for bacterial wilt establishment. We propose strategies to reduce the spread of bacterial wilt via infected seed.\n\nMethodsWe surveyed seed potato stakeholders to characterize interaction networks of potato value chain actors with a special focus on stakeholders engaged in seed potato quality assurance. We collected data regarding Ethiopias potato seed systems and analyzed the risk of spread of RSSC and other pathogens across the country through expert knowledge elicitation. Network metrics were used to characterize the informal seed trade system across Ethiopia, simulating pathogen spread across a network through scenario analyses. We characterized potato exports and imports to identify the risk of bacterial wilt movement through Ethiopias formal trading partners and neighboring countries where bacterial wilt has not yet been reported.\n\nResultsWare potato farmers and traders were reported to have weak communication with other stakeholders in the potato value chain. In network analyses and simulated epidemics, locations in Agew Awi, Gamo, Gofa, Kembata and Tembaro zones were identified as candidate priorities for national surveillance of pathogen invasion and expansion through management interventions and formal seed system development. Ethiopia has formal trade with Sudan, Southern Sudan, Russia, and other countries where bacterial wilt has not been reported. Ethiopia may be at risk of reintroduction of the RSSC from countries where it is present, like Kenya and India.\n\nSignificanceImproving seed systems to manage R. solanacearum and other seedborne pathogens is important for supporting food security and the livelihoods of smallholder farmers in Ethiopia. Implementing surveillance systems and management programs in locations like those identified in Agew Awi, Gamo, Gofa, Kembata, and Tembaro zones, and improving the communication between ware potato traders and other stakeholders, can help to strengthen informal trade of seed potato and mitigate bacterial wilt spread in infected seed.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiologic associations estimated from observational data are often confounded by genetics due to pervasive pleiotropy among complex traits. Many studies either neglect genetic confounding altogether or rely on adjusting for polygenic scores (PGS) in regression analysis. In this study, we unveil that the commonly employed PGS approach is inadequate for removing genetic confounding due to measurement error and model misspecification. To tackle this challenge, we introduce PENGUIN, a principled framework for polygenic genetic confounding control based on variance component estimation. In addition, we present extensions of this approach that can estimate genetically-unconfounded associations using GWAS summary statistics alone as input and between multiple generations of study samples. Through simulations, we demonstrate superior statistical properties of PENGUIN compared to the existing approaches. Applying our method to multiple population cohorts, we reveal and remove substantial genetic confounding in the associations of educational attainment with various complex traits and between parental and offspring education. Our results show that PENGUIN is an effective solution for genetic confounding control in observational data analysis with broad applications in future epidemiologic association studies.",

In this study, we present an improved chromosome-level genome of S. chinensis, characterized by heightened genome continuity (Contig N50 length {approx} 4.180 Mb) and a more complete gene-set (BUSCO evaluation {approx} 95.91%). Our investigation reveal that the extant S. chinensis genome preserves abundant vestiges of a paleo-tetraploidization event that are discernible both at the macroscopic chromosome level and within microscopic gene families, such as the PEL (pseudo-etiolation in light) family. Moreover, we elucidate that this paleo-tetraploidization event is associated with an expansion of the PEL family, potentially initiating a process conducive to its neofunctionalization and/or subfunctionalization.",

    "abstract": "Osteoporosis disrupts the fine-tuned balance between bone formation and resorption leading to reductions in bone quantity and quality, ultimately leading to increased fracture risk. Prevention and treatment of osteoporotic fractures is essential, for reductions in mortality, morbidity and the economic burden, particularly considering the ageing global population. Extreme bone loss that mimics time-accelerated osteoporosis develops in the paralysed limbs following complete spinal cord injury (SCI). In vitro nanoscale vibration (1 kHz, 30- or 90 nm amplitude) has been shown to drive differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells towards osteoblast-like phenotypes, enhancing osteogenesis, and inhibiting osteoclastogenesis, simultaneously. Here we develop and characterise a wearable device designed to deliver continuous nano-amplitude vibration to the hindlimb long bones of rats with complete SCI. We investigate whether a clinically feasible dose of nanovibration (4-hours/day, 5-days/week for 6 weeks) is effective at reversing the established SCI-induced osteoporosis. Laser interferometry and finite element analysis confirmed transmission of nanovibration into the bone, and micro-computed tomography and serum bone formation and resorption markers assessed effectiveness. The intervention did not reverse SCI-induced osteoporosis. However, serum analysis indicated an elevated concentration of the bone formation marker procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) in rats receiving 40 nm amplitude nanovibration, suggesting increased synthesis of type 1 collagen, the major organic component of bone. Therefore, enhanced doses of nanovibrational stimulus may yet prove beneficial in attenuating/reversing osteoporosis, particularly in less severe forms of osteoporosis.",

An analysis of these predictions within the context of the human proteome not only illuminates the known cellular locations of survivin and its interaction partners, but also introduces novel insights into biological functionality.

    "abstract": "BackgroundPredicting phenotypes from genetic variation is foundational for fields as diverse as bioengineering and global change biology, highlighting the importance of efficient methods to predict gene functions. Linking genetic changes to phenotypic changes has been a goal of decades of experimental work, especially for some model gene families including light-sensitive opsin proteins. Opsins can be expressed in vitro to measure light absorption parameters, including {lambda}max - the wavelength of maximum absorbance - which strongly affects organismal phenotypes like color vision. Despite extensive research on opsins, the data remain dispersed, uncompiled, and often challenging to access, thereby precluding systematic and comprehensive analyses of the intricate relationships between genotype and phenotype.\n\nResultsHere, we report a newly compiled database of all heterologously expressed opsin genes with {lambda}max phenotypes called the Visual Physiology Opsin Database (VPOD). VPOD_1.0 contains 864 unique opsin genotypes and corresponding {lambda}max phenotypes collected across all animals from 73 separate publications. We use VPOD data and deepBreaks to show regression-based machine learning (ML) models often reliably predict {lambda}max, account for non-additive effects of mutations on function, and identify functionally critical amino acid sites.\n\nConclusionThe ability to reliably predict functions from gene sequences alone using ML will allow robust exploration of molecular-evolutionary patterns governing phenotype, will inform functional and evolutionary connections to an organisms ecological niche, and may be used more broadly for de-novo protein design. Together, our database, phenotype predictions, and model comparisons lay the groundwork for future research applicable to families of genes with quantifiable and comparable phenotypes.\n\nKey PointsO_LIWe introduce the Visual Physiology Opsin Database (VPOD_1.0), which includes 864 unique animal opsin genotypes and corresponding {lambda}max phenotypes from 73 separate publications.\nC_LIO_LIWe demonstrate that regression-based ML models can reliably predict {lambda}max from gene sequence alone, predict non-additive effects of mutations on function, and identify functionally critical amino acid sites.\nC_LIO_LIWe provide an approach that lays the groundwork for future robust exploration of molecular-evolutionary patterns governing phenotype, with potential broader applications to any family of genes with quantifiable and comparable phenotypes.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Due to shifts in environmental conditions, mutations, or interactions with other biomolecules, some proteins that would normally be soluble can undergo aggregation, resulting in the formation of clumps of amyloid fibrils. Understanding of this phenomenon is of paramount importance due not only to its association with various diseases (including Alzheimers disease), but also due to increasingly abundant evidence for its functional roles. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the propensity to form amyloids is coded by the amino acid sequence and this finding has paved the way for the development of several computational predictors of amyloidogenicity. The ultimate objective of computational methods is to accurately predict the formation of disease-related and functionally relevant amyloids that occur in vivo. These amyloid fibrils are known to form very specific \"cross-{beta}\" structures of protein regions longer than about 15 residues. Remarkably, despite the significance of the naturally occurring amyloids, there has been a lack of datasets specifically dedicated to them. Hence, we built Cross-Beta DB, a database composed of cross-{beta} amyloids formed in natural conditions. This database is expected to be indispensable for benchmarking amyloid predictors. We used the Cross-Beta DB to train and benchmark several such algorithms, using machine learning. The best-performing of these, the random-forest-based Cross-Beta RF Predictor, demonstrated superior performance over the other existing methods, fostering high expectations for an improved prediction of naturally occurring amyloids.",

Mutations in PDZ domains lead to diseases such as cancer and cystic fibrosis, making PDZ domains attractive targets for therapeutic intervention.

Here, we introduce DexDesign, a novel OSPREY-based algorithm for computationally designing de novo D-peptide inhibitors. DexDesign leverages three novel techniques that are broadly applicable to computational protein design: the Minimum Flexible Set, K*-based Mutational Scan, and Inverse Alanine Scan, which enable exponential reductions in the size of the peptide sequence search space. We apply these techniques and DexDesign to generate novel D-peptide inhibitors of two biomedically important PDZ domain targets: CAL and MAST2. We introduce a new framework for analyzing de novo peptides--evaluation along a replication/restitution axis--and apply it to the DexDesign-generated D-peptides. Notably, the peptides we generated are predicted to bind their targets tighter than their targets endogenous ligands, validating the peptides potential as lead therapeutic candidates.

While text mining offers promising advancements in automatic PK parameter extraction, accurate Named Entity Recognition (NER) of PK terms remains a bottleneck due to limited resources. This work addresses this gap by introducing novel corpora and language models specifically designed for effective NER of PK parameters. Leveraging active learning approaches, we developed an annotated corpus containing over 4,000 entity mentions found across the PK literature on PubMed. To identify the most effective model for PK NER, we fine-tuned and evaluated different NER architectures on our corpus. Fine-tuning BioBERT exhibited the best results, achieving a strict F1 score of 90.37% in recognising PK parameter mentions, significantly outperforming heuristic approaches and models trained on existing corpora.

The antagonist mecamylamine (2 mg/kg) was administered prior to NIC to verify pharmacological specificity. Plasma levels of nicotine and cotinine were determined after inhalation and injection.\n\nResultsActivity increased in females for [~]60 minutes after nicotine inhalation, and this was blocked by mecamylamine. A similar magnitude of hyperlocomotion was observed after s.c. administration. Body temperature was reduced after nicotine inhalation by female rats but mecamylamine increased this hypothermia. Increased locomotor activity was observed in male rats if inhalation was extended to 40 minutes or when multiple inhalation epochs were used per session. The temperature of male rats was not altered by nicotine. Plasma nicotine concentrations were slightly lower in male rats than in female rats after 30-minute nicotine vapor inhalation and slightly higher after nicotine injection (1.0 mg/kg, s.c.).\n\nConclusionsNicotine inhalation increases locomotor activity in male and female rats to a similar or greater extent than by subcutaneous injection.

    "abstract": "BackgroundCentrosomes localize to perinuclear foci where they serve multifunctional roles, arranging the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) and anchoring ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) machinery. In mature cardiomyocytes, centrosomal proteins redistribute into a specialized perinuclear cage-like structure, and a potential centrosome-UPS interface has not been studied. Taxilin-beta (Txlnb), a cardiomyocyte-enriched protein, belongs to a family of centrosome adapter proteins implicated in protein quality control. We hypothesize that Txlnb plays a key role in centrosomal-proteasomal crosstalk in cardiomyocytes.\n\nMethodsIntegrative bioinformatics assessed centrosomal gene dysregulation in failing hearts. Txlnb gain/loss-of-function studies were conducted in cultured cardiomyocytes and mice. Txlnbs role in cardiac proteotoxicity and hypertrophy was examined using CryAB-R120G mice and transverse aortic constriction (TAC), respectively. Molecular modeling investigated Txlnb structure/function.\n\nResultsHuman failing hearts show consistent dysregulation of many centrosome-associated genes, alongside UPS-related genes. Txlnb emerged as a candidate regulator of cardiomyocyte proteostasis that localizes to the perinuclear centrosomal compartment. Txlnbs interactome strongly supports its involvement in cytoskeletal, microtubule, and UPS processes, particularly centrosome-related functions. Overexpressing Txlnb in cardiomyocytes reduced ubiquitinated protein accumulation and enhanced proteasome activity during hypertrophy. Txlnb-knockout (KO) mouse hearts exhibit proteasomal insufficiency and altered cardiac growth, evidenced by ubiquitinated protein accumulation, decreased 26S{beta}5 proteasome activity, and lower mass with age. In Cryab-R120G mice, Txlnb loss worsened heart failure, causing lower ejection fractions. After TAC, Txlnb-KO mice also showed reduced ejection fraction, increased heart mass, and elevated ubiquitinated protein accumulation. Investigations into the molecular mechanisms revealed that Txlnb-KO did not affect proteasomal subunit expression but led to the upregulation of Txlna and several centrosomal proteins (Cep63, Ofd1, and Tubg) suggesting altered centrosomal dynamics. Structural predictions support Txlnbs role as a specialized centrosomal-adapter protein bridging centrosomes with proteasomes, confirmed by microtubule-dependent perinuclear localization.\n\nConclusionsTogether, these data provide initial evidence connecting Txlnb to cardiac proteostasis, hinting at the potential importance of functional bridging between specialized centrosomes and UPS in cardiomyocytes.",

    "abstract": "Human muscles exhibit great versatility, generating forces needed for highly athletic but also fine motor tasks under a variety of contraction conditions. While muscle models used in musculoskeletal modelling can exhibit a similar range of versatility, they often lack a realistic structure with multiple motor units (MUs) and rate-coded control. To investigate how these features affect a muscles ability to generate desired force profiles, we have carried out simulations with nine alternative MU pool models for two different cases: 1) a tibialis anterior muscle generating forces matching an isometric trapezoidal force profile, and 2) a generic shoulder muscle matching force profiles from simulated reaching movements while undergoing predetermined length changes. The results suggest that the characteristics of MU pools can impact the pools ability to match a given force profile, and that the slowly varying forces of isometric trapezoidal tasks and the relatively fast-changing forces during non-isometric reaching favour different MU pool structures. However, the differences in the performance of different MU pool types are relatively small when considered across all tasks. Furthermore, relatively good force matching results could be obtained with feedforward control utilising a simple mapping from the desired force to a common input signal to all MUs, without a need for feedback corrections. While all MU pool models performed well in the specific conditions tested, our investigation highlights the need to consider the functional characteristics of MU pools. From the perspective of musculoskeletal modelling, rate-coded multi-MU muscles must accomplish a diverse set of dynamic tasks requiring larger force ranges or repeated rapid changes in force. As the range of tasks becomes more realistic, we would expect the properties and construction of MU pools to become increasingly important to achieve good performance.\n\nAuthor summaryHuman muscles are versatile, generating forces needed for highly athletic but also fine motor tasks. Similar versatility is desirable in musculoskeletal modelling, which is used to study human movement under a variety of health conditions. The muscles used in such models are often simplified compared to real muscles, consisting of single rather than multiple motor units (MUs), and controlled with a continuous input rather than spike-like impulses. In this work, we have used computer simulations to investigate how including these realistic muscle features affects a muscles ability to produce the forces needed for different tasks. We observed that different ways to recruit the MUs and determine the frequency of input spikes have relatively little impact on how well the muscle can match desired forces both during long sustained contractions and dynamic reaching movements. However, tasks that require a large force range or repeated rapid changes in force can be challenging for MU pools. Hence, our results emphasise that representation of MU pools in musculoskeletal modelling should be considered from the perspective of functionality if the modelled muscles need to be as versatile as real muscles.",

    "abstract": "In nature, species synchronize reproduction and energy metabolism with seasons to optimize survival and growth. While the effects of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) exposure on conventional laboratory rodents are increasingly studied, their impacts on mammalian seasonal adaptation remain unexplored. This study investigates the effect of oral exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) on physiological and neuroendocrine seasonal adaptation in Djungarian hamsters. Adult female and male hamsters were orally exposed to BPA (5, 50, or 500 {micro}g/kg/d) or vehicle during a 10-week transition from a long (LP) to short (SP) photoperiod (winter transition) or vice versa (summer transition). Changes in body weight, food intake, and pelage color were monitored weekly and, at the end of the exposure, gene expression of hypothalamic markers of photoperiodic, reproductive and metabolic integration, reproductive organ activity, and glycemia were assessed. Our results revealed sex-specific effects of BPA on acquiring SP and LP phenotypes. During LP to SP transition, females exposed to 500 {micro}g/kg/d BPA exhibited delayed body weight loss and reduced feed efficiency associated with a lower expression of somatostatin in the arcuate nucleus (ARC), while males exposed to 5 {micro}g/kg/d BPA showed an accelerated acquisition of SP-induced metabolic parameters. During SP to LP transition, females exposed to 5 {micro}g/kg/d BPA displayed a faster LP adaptation in reproductive and metabolic parameters, along with quicker ARC kisspeptin downregulation and delayed ARC Pomc upregulation, while males exposed to BPA exhibited decreased expression of central photoperiodic integrators without changes in the physiological LP acquisition. This pioneering study investigating EDC impacts on mammalian seasonal physiology shows that BPA alters the dynamic of metabolic adaptation to both SP and LP transitions with marked sex dimorphism, causing temporal discordance in seasonal adaptation between males and females. These findings emphasize the importance of investigating EDCs impact on non-conventional animal models, providing insights into wildlife physiology.\n\nHighlightsO_LIDjungarian hamsters seasonal adaptation is disrupted by BPA oral exposure\nC_LIO_LIBPA delays in females and accelerates in males the metabolic adaptation to short days\nC_LIO_LIBPA accelerates in females, not in males, metabolic/reproductive adaptation to long days\nC_LIO_LIBPA affects the photoperiodic expression of central reproductive and metabolic genes\nC_LI\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=89 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/580037v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3ddec8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ed3536org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4083c8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18bd837_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical abstract\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "The ENaC gamma subunit is essential for homeostasis of Na+, K+, and body fluid. Dual subunit cleavage before and after a short inhibitory tract allows dissociation of this tract, increasing channel open probability (PO), in vitro. Cleavage proximal to the tract occurs at a furin recognition sequence (143RKRR146 in mouse). Loss of furin-mediated cleavage prevents in vitro activation of the channel by proteolysis at distal sites. We hypothesized that 143RKRR146 mutation to 143QQQQ146 (Q4) in 129/Sv mice would reduce ENaC PO, impair flow-stimulated flux of Na+ (JNa) and K+ (JK) in perfused collecting ducts, reduce colonic amiloride-sensitive short circuit current (ISC), and impair Na+, K+, and body fluid homeostasis. Immunoblot of Q4/Q4 mouse kidney lysates confirmed loss of a band consistent in size with the furin-cleaved proteolytic fragment. However, Q4/Q4 male mice on a low Na+ diet did not exhibit altered ENaC PO or flow-induced JNa, though flow-induced JK modestly decreased. Colonic amiloride-sensitive ISC in Q4/Q4 mice was not altered. Q4/Q4 males, but not females, exhibited mildly impaired fluid volume conservation when challenged with a low Na+ diet. Blood Na+ and K+ were unchanged on a regular, low Na+, or high K+ diet. These findings suggest that biochemical evidence of gamma subunit cleavage should not be used in isolation to evaluate ENaC activity. Further, factors independent of gamma subunit cleavage modulate channel PO and the influence of ENaC on Na+, K+, and fluid volume homeostasis in 129/Sv mice, in vivo.",

    "abstract": "The medicinal properties of Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera L. Dunal) are attributed to the presence of unique class of natural products called as withanolides and their glycosylated forms, withanosides. Withanosides are proposed to be formed from withanolides by the action of glycosyltransferases (GTs). This study reports the functional characterization of two GTs (WsGT4 and WsGT6) from W. somnifera that exhibited induced expression in response to methyl jasmonate treatment and showed highest expression in leaves compared to other tissues. Biochemical assays with recombinant WsGT proteins showed that WsGT4 and WsGT6 formed glycosylated products with four and one of the seven tested withanolides substrates, respectively. WsGT4 catalyzed product formation using withanolide A, withanolide B, withanone, and 12-deoxywithastramonolide as substrates, with UDP-glucose serving as the glucose donor, while WsGT6 catalyzed the product formation only with withaferin A as substrate employing either UDP-glucose or UDP-galactose as sugar donors. Moreover, in planta studies through virus-induced gene silencing and transient overexpression of WsGT4 and WsGT6 in W. somnifera leaves modulated the levels of withanolides and withanosides, indicating their role in withanosides biosynthesis. Furthermore, while individual silencing of both WsGT4 and WsGT6 in W. somnifera reduced the tolerance to Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 growth, their overexpression enhanced the tolerance to the bacterium in W. somnifera. Taken together, these results shed light on the roles of WsGT4 and WsGT6 in withanoside biosynthesis and defence against model bacterial pathogen in W. somnifera.",

    "abstract": "Ultraviolet (UV) radiation influences development and genome stability in organisms; however, its impacts on meiosis, a special cell division essential for the delivery of genetic information over generations in eukaryotes, remain not yet elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that UV attenuates the centromere-mediated meiotic chromosome stability and induces unreduced gametes in Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that UV reduces crossover (CO) rate but does not interfere with meiotic chromosome integrity. Functional centromere-specific histone 3 (CENH3) is required for the obligate CO formation, and plays a role in protection of homolog synapsis and sister-chromatid cohesion under UV stress. Moreover, UV specifically alters the orientation and organization of spindles and phragmoplasts at meiosis II, resulting in meiotic restitution and unreduced gametes. Further, we determine that UV-induced meiotic restitution does not rely on the UV Resistance Locus8-mediated UV perception and the Tapetal Development and Function1- and Aborted Microspores-dependent tapetum development, but occurs possibly via impacted JASON function and downregulated Parallel Spindle1. This study sheds light on the impacts of UV on meiotic genome stability and gametophytic ploidy consistency, which thus may influence genome evolution in flowering plants.",

Plant roots respond to transient water stress by temporarily ceasing branching using the acclimative response xerobranching1.

Mutations in specific cysteine residues in IAA3/SHY2 disrupt redox-mediated multimerization and interaction with co-repressor TPL, but not with auxin response partner ARF7 and auxin receptor TIR1. ROS-mediated oligomerization of IAA3/SHY2 is required for efficient ARF mediated target gene repression during Xerobranching and lateral root emergence. We demonstrate that AUX/IAA proteins vary in their redox mediated multimerization, revealing a new auxin response regulatory mechanism that directly connects ROS sensing to auxin signalling. Our study reveals how ROS, auxin and water stress intersect to shape acclimative responses in plant roots and maintain their phenotypic plasticity.",

Frequent field visits were made to study and document the floral assemblage and biodiversity in the swamp from, November 2023 to January 2024. The swamp is dominated by Myristica magnifica Bedd. The swamp is a part of a sacred grove and it is protected by Villagers due to religious beliefs.

    "abstract": "Despite the importance of the postdoctoral position in the training of scientists for independent research careers, few studies have addressed recruiting and hiring of postdocs. We conducted a pilot study on postdoctoral hiring in the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at the California Institute of Technology to serve as a starting point to better understand postdoctoral recruiting and hiring processes. From this survey of both postdocs and faculty, together with the available literature, the picture emerges that the postdoc hiring process is more decentralized than either faculty hiring or graduate admissions. Postdoc positions are often filled through a passive process where the initial expression of interest from a prospective postdoc is through a \"cold-call\" contact to a prospective advisor. Individual faculty members are often responsible for developing and implementing their own outreach and recruitment plans and deciding who to hire into a postdoc position. The overall opacity of the processes and practices by which postdocs are identified, recruited, and hired make it difficult to pinpoint where interventions could be effective to ensure equitable hiring practices. Implementation of such practices is critical to training a diverse postdoc population and subsequently of the future STEM faculty recruited from this group.",

    "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has not only caused the COVID-19 pandemic but also had a major impact on farmed mink production in several European countries. In Denmark, the entire population of farmed mink (over 15 million animals) was culled in late 2020. During the period of June to November 2020, mink on 290 farms (out of about 1100 in the country) were shown to be infected with SARS-CoV-2. Genome sequencing identified changes in the virus within the mink and it is estimated that about 4000 people in Denmark became infected with these mink virus variants. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the generation of multiple clusters of the virus within the mink. A detailed analysis of the changes in the virus during replication in mink and, in parallel, in the human population in Denmark, during the same time period, has been performed here. The majority of cases in mink involved variants that had the Y435F substitution and the H69/V70 deletion within the Spike (S) protein; these changes emerged early on during the outbreak. However, further introductions of the virus, with variants lacking these changes, from the human population into mink also occurred. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the available viral genome data, we estimate that there were a minimum of about 17 separate examples of mink to human transmission of the virus in Denmark, using a conservative approach, but up to 60 such events (95% credible interval: (35-77)) were identified using parsimony to count cross-species jumps on transmission trees inferred using a Bayesian method. Using the latter approach, it was estimated that there were 136 jumps (95% credible interval: (112-164)) from humans to mink. Thus, transmission of these viruses from humans to mink, mink to mink, from mink to humans and between humans were all observed.\n\nAuthor summaryIn addition to causing a pandemic in the human population, SARS-CoV-2 also infected farmed mink. In Denmark, after the first identification of infection in mink during June 2020, a decision was made in November 2020 to cull all the farmed mink. Within this outbreak, mink on 290 farms (out of about 1100 in the country) were found to have been infected. We showed, by analysis of the viruses from the mink, that the viruses on the farms were mainly of three different, but closely related, types (termed Clusters 2, 3 and 4) that shared certain distinctive features. Thus, we found that many outbreaks in mink resulted from transmission of the virus between mink farms. However, we identified that new introductions of other virus variants, presumably from infected humans, also occurred. Furthermore, we showed that spread of the virus from infected mink to humans also happened on multiple occasions. Thus, transmission of these viruses from humans to mink, mink to mink, from mink to humans and between humans were all observed.",

These vegetatively propagated crops are prone to the buildup of pests and diseases causing seed degeneration. In this study, we address seed degeneration in the context of natural and human-driven crises, to provide insights that can guide the decisions of humanitarian groups to reduce seed degeneration. We identified locations in Cameroon and Ethiopia that are likely to be particularly important for pathogen and pest spread in cropland network analyses. We analyzed cropland networks in each country to develop a map of locations that are candidate priorities for disease and pest management and surveillance. For example, locations in central and western Oromia, Ethiopia, are likely important for potato pathogen and pest spread given the locations roles in the cropland network. Next, we used expert knowledge elicitation to characterize crop health risk in these systems. For example, experts reported with high consensus that there are formal and informal imports of cassava from Gabon to Cameroon, which pose a risk to cassava production in Cameroon through seedborne pathogens. These results can inform regional and national surveillance and management strategies and provide a baseline for more in-depth studies in Cameroon and Ethiopia. The results can also inform decision-making in the humanitarian sector, for designing on-the-ground actions to avoid unintentional spread of pathogens and pests during agricultural recovery interventions.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative genetics requires large datasets of diverse phenotyped-genotyped strains from the same species. A special need is for such archived biological material and computerized data in sexually reproducing individuals from a species. Here we leverage sexual mating among close to 100 diverse natural isolates of the yeast S. cerevisiae that form about 4,000 hybrids combinations in several ecologically relevant growth conditions. In a first genetic study of this new resource we focus on fitness measurements and its modes of inheritance as a quantitative trait from parents to offspring hybrids. We employ genomic barcoding of all strains and a barcode recombination technique to follow hybrids of each successful mate combination. For all parents, and separately for all offspring hybrids we measure fitness under each condition. We focus on the inheritance of fitness, the ultimate evolutionary trait, and its inheritance as a quantitative trait upon sexual mating. Predicting hybrid fitness given parental parameters is a major challenge as it is likely multi-factorial. We find that hybrids fitness in fermentable carbon source correlates positively, yet modestly, with parental fitness, while on non-fermentable carbon, hybrid fitness shows no detectable correlation with parental fitness. Instead, the non-fermentable condition, hybrid fitness increases sharply with genetic distance between their parents, suggesting that outbreeding maximizes fitness irrespective of parental fitness at that condition. The number of minor alleles in the genome of each hybrid, analogous to polygenic risk score in classical genetics, negatively correlates with fitness in both conditions. Fitness inheritance can be explained by either a dominance or a co-dominance modes of inheritance, in the non-fermentable and fermentable conditions respectively. Our newly suggested biological resource and data provide new foundations for a quantitative research in genetics and evolution upon sexual mating. Furthermore, our barcoded strains and mating tracking method provide an important research resource for the yeast community.",

A 2.5K targeted GBS assay for potato was developed using the DArTagTM technology and later expanded to 4K targets. Genomic markers were selected from the potato InfiniumTM SNP array to maximize genome coverage and polymorphism rates. When sample depth was summarized by marker, the power law [~]{sigma}0.8 was consistently observed between the mean () and standard deviation ({sigma}). The DArTag and SNP array platforms produced equivalent dendrograms in a test set of 298 tetraploid samples, and 83% of the common markers showed good quantitative agreement, with RMSE (root-mean-squared-error) less than 0.5. DArTag is suited for genomic selection candidates in the clonal evaluation trial, coupled with imputation to a higher density platform for the training population. Our hypothesis that linkage analysis would be highly accurate for imputing tetraploid marker data was confirmed: the RMSE was 0.15 compared to 0.95 by the Random Forest method in a half-diallel population. Regarding high-value traits, the DArTag markers for resistance to potato virus Y, golden cyst nematode, and potato wart appeared to track their targets successfully, as did multi-allelic markers for maturity and tuber shape.

    "abstract": "The generation of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) to specific HIV epitopes of the HIV Envelope (Env) is one of the cornerstones of HIV vaccine research. The current animal models we use have been unable to reliable produce a broadly neutralizing antibody response, with the exception of cows. Cows have rapidly and reliably produced a CD4 binding site response by homologous prime and boosting with a native-like Env trimer. In small animal models other engineered immunogens previously have been able to focus antibody responses to the bnAb V2-apex region of Env. Here, we immunized two groups of cows (n=4) with two regiments of V2-apex focusing immunogens to investigate whether antibody responses could be directed to the V2-apex on Env. Group 1 were immunized with chimpanzee simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-Env trimer that shares its V2-apex with HIV, followed by immunization with C108, a V2-apex focusing immunogen, and finally boosted with a cross-clade native-like trimer cocktail. Group 2 were immunized with HIV C108 Env trimer followed by the same HIV trimer cocktail as Group 1. Longitudinal serum analysis showed that one cow in each group developed serum neutralizing antibody responses to the V2-apex. Eight and 11 bnAbs were isolated from Group 1 and Group 2 cows respectively. The best bnAbs had both medium breadth and potency. Potent and broad responses developed later than previous CD4bs cow bnAbs and required several different immunogens. All isolated bnAbs were derived from the ultralong CDRH3 repertoire. The finding that cow antibodies can target multiple broadly neutralizing epitopes on the HIV surface reveals important insight into the generation of immunogens and testing in the cow animal model. The exclusive isolation of ultralong CDRH3 bnAbs, despite only comprising a small percent of the cow repertoire, suggests these antibodies outcompete the long and short CDRH3 antibodies during the bnAb response.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe elicitation of epitope-specific broadly neutralizing antibodies is highly desirable for an HIV vaccine as bnAbs can prevent HIV infection in robust animal challenge models and humans, but to date, cows are the only model shown to reliably produce HIV bnAb responses on Envelope (Env) immunization. These responses involve Abs with ultralong CDRH3s and are all directed to a single site, the CD4 binding site. To determine whether this is a unique phenomenon or whether cow antibodies can target further bnAb sites on Env, we employed an immunization protocol that generated cow bnAbs to a second site, the V2-apex. We conclude that ultralong CDRH3s are well adapted to penetrate the glycan shield of HIV Env and recognize conserved regions and may constitute protein units, either in the context of antibodies or in other engineered proteins, that could be deployed as anti-HIV reagents.",

    "abstract": "In asthma, the airway epithelium is hyperplastic, hypertrophied, and lined with numerous large MUC5AC-containing goblet cells (GC). Furthermore, the normal epithelial architecture is disorganized with numerous, what we here describe as, ectopic goblet cells (eGC) deep within the thickened epithelial layer disconnected from the lumenal surface. mTOR is a highly conserved pathway that regulates cell size and proliferation. We hypothesized that the balance between mTOR and autophagy signaling regulates key features of the asthma epithelial layer. Airway histological sections from subjects with asthma had increased frequency of eGC and increased levels of mTOR phosphorylation target-Ribosomal S6. Using human airway epithelial cells (hAECs) with IL-13 stimulation and timed withdrawal to stimulate resolution, we found that multiple key downstream phosphorylation targets downstream from the mTOR complex were increased during early IL-13-mediated mucous metaplasia, and then significantly declined during resolution. The IL-13-mediated changes in mTOR signaling were paralleled by morphologic changes with airway epithelial hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and frequency of eGC. We then examined the relationship between mTOR and autophagy using mice deficient in autophagy protein Atg16L1. Despite having increased cytoplasmic mucins, mouse AECs from Atg16L1 deficient mice had no significant difference in mTOR downstream signaling. mTOR inhibition with rapamycin led to a loss of IL-13-mediated epithelial hypertrophy, hyperplasia, ectopic GC distribution, and reduction in cytoplasmic MUC5AC levels. mTOR inhibition was also associated with a reduction in aberrant IL-13-mediated hAEC proliferation and migration. Our findings demonstrate that mTOR signaling is associated with mucous metaplasia and is crucial to the disorganized airway epithelial structure and function characteristic of muco-obstructive airway diseases such as asthma.\n\nGraphical Abstract Key ConceptsO_LIThe airway epithelium in asthma is disorganized and characterized by cellular proliferation, aberrant migration, and goblet cell mucous metaplasia.\nC_LIO_LImTOR signaling is a dynamic process during IL-13-mediated mucous metaplasia, increasing with IL-13 stimulation and declining during resolution.\nC_LIO_LImTOR signaling is strongly increased in the asthmatic airway epithelium.\nC_LIO_LImTOR signaling is associated with the development of key features of the metaplastic airway epithelium including cell proliferation and ectopic distribution of goblet cells and aberrant cellular migration.\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of mTOR leads to decreased epithelial hypertrophy, reduced ectopic goblet cells, and cellular migration.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Epithelial tissues use homeostatic defence mechanisms to actively remove aberrant or poorly functioning cells to maintain tissue health. We show that when present in tissues in low numbers, cells expressing cancer-causing mutations compete with normal cells for survival and are often eliminated. This implies that tumour initiation would require mechanisms whereby mutant cells override tissue homeostasis and remain in a tissue; however, the biology of these initial events is poorly understood. Here, we use an in vivo model of sporadic tumorigenesis in the adult pancreas to show that cell elimination processes are inefficient and a proportion of KrasG12D or p53R172H expressing cells are never eliminated from the epithelium. Using RNA sequencing of non-eliminated mutant populations, we reveal a general activation of the non-canonical Wnt pathway. We demonstrate that non-eliminated KrasG12D cells express cell dormancy and diapause gene signatures, suggesting non-eliminated KRasG12D cells adopt a dormant cell state in vivo. To model cell competition in vitro, we used established MDCK cell systems to show that active Wnt or cell cycle arrest blocks elimination of RAS mutant cells from normal epithelial cell sheets. Importantly, we demonstrate that Wnt signalling is a general mechanism that blocks elimination of some KrasG12D and p53R172H cells from pancreas tissues in vivo. Our results suggest that mutant cells activate Wnt and/or a dormant cell state to avoid homeostatic tissue defence mechanisms and survive in the adult pancreas.",

    "abstract": "Joint Species Distribution Modelling (JSDM) is a powerful and increasingly widely used statistical methodology in biodiversity modelling, enabling researchers to assess and predict the joint distribution of species across space and time. However, JSDM can be computationally intensive and even prohibitive, especially for large datasets and sophisticated model structures. To address computational limitations of JSDM, we expanded one widely used JSDM framework, Hmsc-R, by developing a Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) -compatible implementation of its model fitting algorithm. While our augmented framework retains the original user interface in R, its new computational core is coded in Python and dominantly uses TensorFlow library. This enhancement primarily targets to enable leveraging high-performance computing resources effectively, though it also accelerates model fitting with consumer-level machines. This upgrade is designed to leverage high-performance computing resources more effectively. We evaluated the performance of the proposed implementation across diverse model configurations and dataset sizes. Our results indicate significant model fitting speed-up compared to the existing Hmsc-R package across most models. Notably, for the largest datasets, we achieved >1000 times speed-ups. This GPU-compatible enhancement boosts the scalability of Hmsc-R package by several orders of magnitude, reaching a significantly higher level.

    "abstract": "By introducing a simple model of ecological interactions where individuals interact trophically, and through a game dynamic, I show that the dissipative flow of resources can derive evolution and lead to the emergence of a scale-invariant ecosystem exhibiting a wide range of mean and fluctuation scaling laws that govern trophic interactions and game dynamics. The eco-evolutionary approach suggests life history trade-offs are a natural consequence of ecological dynamics and, combined with the non-equilibrium dynamic, lead to the evolution of consistent personalities. Aggressiveness and personality consistency depend on trophic position, and predators evolve a higher aggressiveness and starker personality differences.\n\nAuthor summaryThroughout the history of life, the flow of energy across ecosystems has contributed to the evolution of complex forms of life and strikingly universal patterns on a large scale. However, it is not clear what factors lead to such universal patterns and how they relate to evolution. Simple mathematical models suggest that the dissipative flow of resources through ecosystems leads to self-organization in a critical state with scale-invariant avalanches of activity. The scale-invariant structure of ecosystems results in a complex set of scaling laws governing the structure and dynamics of populations. The same non-equilibrium ecological dynamics derive evolution and account for the evolution of individuals behavioral differences and consistent personalities.",

    "abstract": "Task space control, also known as operational space control, is a useful paradigm for investigating neural control of human movement using predictive simulations. While some efforts have been made to implement task space control in the widely used open-source platform OpenSim, existing implementations do not support floating base kinematics, which is necessary for simulating gait and other types of human movement. Our aim in this work is to fill that gap. In this paper, we describe the theory and implementation of a floating base kinematics task space framework for torque- and muscle-driven simulations in OpenSim. Our framework builds on previous work that was limited to models with a base (i.e., root) segment fixed to ground. In addition, we integrate various algorithms from robotics in order to handle dynamically changing contacts and task prioritization. The framework can be used to generate realistic walking gaits by prescribing a small set of controller gains and gait parameters such as step length, step width and center of mass velocity. Task can be specified as desired positions, rotations, or higher-order feature such as base of support and whole-body angular momentum. We provide several examples to demonstrate how framework is successful in orchestrating a complex hierarchy of tasks that work in concert to perform both balance control and gait generation. The implementation is freely available for roboticists and biomechanists to use with OpenSim.\n\nAuthor summaryRecent advances in computational biomechanics have provided researchers with tools capable of predicting human movement. Previous approaches to simulating human movement required experimental data as input and the simulation would replicate the experimental motion. This conventional approach limited the scientific insights to the specific movement recorded in the laboratory. With predictive approaches, researchers can investigate how a person might respond to various factors, such as reduced muscle strength or an assistive device such as a robotic exoskeleton. Existing approaches for generating predictive simulations utilize optimization-based approaches, which can be time-consuming and difficult to troubleshoot. Task space control is an alternative approach which is widely used in robotics. Conceptually, task space control aims to generate a simulation by specifying \"tasks\", such as moving a hand or foot to a desired position, and computing the joint angles required to achieve the task. Here we aim to outline the mathematics behind task space control and demonstrate how task space control can be used to generate simulations of movements such as walking.",

    "abstract": "Polysaccharides are a major class of natural polymers found abundantly across all major life forms and play a critical role as structural, metabolic, or functional components in biomolecular processes. Some polysaccharides like cellulose and hyaluronan are synthesized by membrane-bound family-2 glycosyltransferases (GTs). Despite the fact that the GT-2 family has the maximum number of deposited sequences, the biochemistry of GT-2 family enzymes is still poorly understood due to difficulties associated with GT membrane protein expression, purification, and reconstitution in lipid carriers. Here, we chose Populus tremula x tremuloides cellulose synthase 8 (PttCesA8) and Streptococcus equisimilis hyaluronan synthase (SeHas) as putative family-2-GTs to be expressed in a wheat-germ-based cell-free expression (CFE) system as proteoliposomes. The cell-free products were obtained as reconstituted liposomes directly from CFE reactions at high yields and short processing times compared to other approaches. GT enzymes expression was confirmed using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, and the integration of GTs in lipid layers was observed using cryogenic electron microscopy. Both GTs tested were catalytically active when incubated with their respective substrates and cofactors. The Michalis-Menten kinetic constants, Km for PttCesA8, was 295.8 {micro}M, and SeHas was 321.51 {micro}M (toward UDP N-Acetyl Glucosamine) and 207.88 {micro}M (toward UDP Glucuronic Acid), respectively. UDP was found to actively inhibit both these GTs with apparent inhibition constants of 10.08 {micro}M and 24.38 {micro}M. Mutation of specific conserved residues in structure-deficit SeHas confirmed the importance of lysine-139, glutamine-248, and threonine-283 residues in hyaluronan biosynthesis. In summary, wheat-germ-based CFE can be used to express functionally active and liposome-reconstituted family-2 GTs at high yields with relative ease to enable classical enzymology assays and will also enable more detailed structural studies in the near future.",

    "abstract": "Using long k-mers to find sequence matches is increasingly used in many bioinformatic applications, including metagenomic sequence classification. The accuracy of these downstream applications relies on the density of the reference databases, which, luckily, are rapidly growing. While the increased density provides hope for dramatic improvements in accuracy, scalability is a concern. The k-mers are kept in the memory during the query time, and saving all k-mers of these ever-expanding databases is fast becoming impractical. Several strategies for subsampling k-mers have been proposed, including minimizers and finding taxon-specific k-mers. However, we contend that these strategies are inadequate, especially when reference sets are taxonomically imbalanced, as are most microbial libraries. In this paper, we specifically ask the question: Given limited memory, what is the best strategy to select a subset of k-mers from an ultra-large dataset to include in a library such that the classification of reads suffers the least? We explore strategies to achieve this goal and show a set of experiments demonstrating the limitations of existing approaches, especially for novel and poorly sampled groups. We propose a library construction algorithm called KRANK (K-mer RANKer) that combines several components, including a hierarchical selection strategy with adaptive size restrictions and an equitable coverage strategy. We implement KRANK in highly optimized code and combine it with the locality-sensitive-hashing classifier CONSULT-II. Our method is able to reduce the memory consumption from roughly 140Gb down to 6, 12, or 24Gb, with only a 3.8%, 2.5%, or 0.5% loss in the F1 score. We show in extensive analyses that KRANK outperforms alternatives in both taxonomic classification and taxonomic profiling, using reasonable memory sizes.\n\nCode availabilityThe implementation is available at https://github.com/bo1929/KRANK.",

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics allows identifying and quantifying thousands of proteins but suffers from challenges when measuring human antibodies due to their vast variety. The mainly used bottom-up proteomics approaches rely on database searches that compare experimental values of peptides and their fragments to theoretical values derived from protein sequences in a database. While the human body can produce millions of distinct antibodies, the current databases for human antibodies such as UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot are limited to only 1095 sequences (as of 2024 Jan). This limitation may hinder the identification of new antibodies using mass spectrometry. Therefore, extending the database for mass spectrometry is an important task for discovering new antibodies. Recent genomic studies have compiled millions of human antibody sequences publicly accessible through the Observed Antibody Space (OAS) database. However, this data has yet to be exploited to confirm the presence of these antibodies. In this study, we adopted this extensive collection of antibody sequences for conducting efficient database searches in publicly available proteomics data with a focus on the SARS-CoV-2 disease. Thirty million heavy antibody sequences from 146 SARS-CoV-2 patients in the OAS database were digested in silico to obtain 18 million unique peptides. These peptides were then used to create new databases for bottom-up proteomics. We used those databases for searching new antibody peptides in publicly available SARS-CoV-2 human plasma samples in the Proteomics Identification Database (PRIDE). This approach avoids false positives in antibody peptide identification as confirmed by searching against negative controls (brain samples) and employing different database sizes. We show that the found sequences provide valuable information to distinguish diseased from healthy and expect that the newly discovered antibody peptides can be further employed to develop therapeutic antibodies. The method will be broadly applicable to find characteristic antibodies for other diseases.",

Our experiments were conducted leveraging the public, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) repository, focusing specifically on renal cancer. We introduced additional patch-level labels to improve the model performance. The generation of tumor heat maps targeted three primary cancer subtypes: clear cell, papillary, and chromophobe. To enhance our approach, we implemented center-loss and introduced a method aimed at refining the quality of patches. The experimental outcomes highlight superior performance compared to state-of-the-art method.

    "abstract": "Cell fate transition is fundamentally a spatiotemporal process, but previous work has largely neglected the spatial dimension. Incorporating both space and time into models of cell fate transition would be a key step toward characterizing how interactions among neighboring cells, the presence of local niche factors, and physical migration of cells contribute to tissue development. To realize this potential, we propose topological velocity inference (TopoVelo), a model for jointly inferring spatial and temporal dynamics of cell fate transition from spatial transcriptomic data. TopoVelo extends the RNA velocity framework to model single-cell gene expression dynamics of an entire tissue with spatially coupled differential equations. Our principled probabilistic approach enables the incorporation of time point labels and multiple slices. We further introduce the idea of cell velocity, which is defined as the physical direction of cell maturation and migration. Simulated data analysis indicates that incorporating spatial coordinates significantly improves the accuracy of velocity and time inference. When evaluated on real Slide-Seq and Stereo-Seq data, TopoVelo significantly improves the spatial coherence of inferred cell ordering compared to previous methods. Furthermore, TopoVelo accurately recovers the expected directions of cell differentiation and migration in the embryonic mouse cerebral cortex, gut, and lung. Our work introduces a new dimension into the study of cell fate transitions and lays a foundation for modeling the collective dynamics of cells comprising an entire tissue.",

    "abstract": "Predicting whether a compound can cause drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is difficult due to the complexity of its mechanism. The production of reactive metabolites is one of the major causes of DILI, particularly idiosyncratic DILI. The cysteine trapping assay is one of the methods to detect reactive metabolites which bind to microsomes covalently. However, it is cumbersome to use 35S isotope-labeled cysteine for this assay. Therefore, we constructed an in silico classification model for predicting a positive/negative outcome in the cysteine trapping assay to accelerate the drug discovery process. In this study, we collected 475 compounds (436 in-house compounds and 39 publicly available drugs). Using a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) and Random Forest (RF) with extended connectivity fingerprint (ECFP) 4, we built machine learning models to predict the covalent binding risk of compounds. The 5-fold cross-validation (CV) and hold-out test were evaluated in random- and time-split trials. Additionally, we investigated the substructures that contributed to positive results in the cysteine trapping assay through the framework of the MPNN model. In the random-split dataset, the AUC-ROC of MPNN and RF were 0.698 and 0.811 in the 5-fold CV, and 0.742 and 0.819 in the hold-out test, respectively. In the time-split dataset, AUC-ROC of MPNN and RF were 0.729 and 0.617 in the 5-fold CV, and 0.625 and 0.559 in the hold-out test, restrictively. This result suggests that the MPNN model has a higher predictivity than RF in the time-split dataset. Hence, we conclude that the in silico MPNN classification model for the cysteine trapping assay have better predictive power. Furthermore, most of the substructures that contributed positively to the cysteine trapping assay were consistent with previous reports such as propranolol, verapamil, and imipramine. This is a new machine learning model that can determine the outcome of the cysteine trapping assay, namely accurately predicting the covalent binding risk as the one of factors of idiosyncratic DILI. We believe that this can contribute to mitigating DILI risk for reactive metabolites at the early stages of drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Huntingtons disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by an aberrant polyQ expansion in the Huntingtin protein (htt). In cases with polyQ[&ge;]35, the expanded polyQ tract misfolds and forms large intra-cellular aggregates. Despite significant attention, no clear consensus has been reached on the aggregate structures of the Huntingtin exon 1 protein fragments. Here, we apply coarse grained molecular dynamics to examine the mechanisms driving the aggregation process and resulting aggregate structures of 5 different N17 + polyQ systems, with polyQ lengths of 7, 15, 35, 40 and 45, using the ProMPT forcefield. Elongation of the polyQ domain results in an increase in {beta}-sheet rich structures. At longer polyQ lengths, intra-molecular {beta}-sheets are preferred over inter-molecular sheets, due to the collapse of the elongated polyQ domain into hairpin rich conformations. Crucially, we have discovered that changes in the polyQ length affect the resulting aggregated structure. With short polyQ domains, the N17 domains of htt bundle together, forming a hydrophobic core. As the polyQ length increases, competition between the hydrophobic interactions of N17 and the polar interactions of polyQ arises, leading to a tightly packed polyQ core, with an external distribution of the N17 domains. These findings can help explain the toxic gain-of function that mutant htt acquires.\n\nAuthor summaryIn this work, we consider 5 huntingtin peptide systems-N17 with polyQ lengths of 7, 15 35, 40 and 45, and examine structural characteristics of both the monomeric and aggregated peptide systems. We observe the presence of helices and {beta}-sheet in the polyQ domain. Most importantly, we discovered that the polyQ length affects the resultant aggregate structure. With short polyQ lengths, there is a competition between the hydrophobic interactions of N17 and the polar interactions of the polyQ domain, leading to a bundling of the N17 domains. At longer lengths of polyQ, the polar interactions dominate leading to a loss of N17 bundling and external distribution of the N17 domains. We suspect these variations in the aggregate morphology could explain possible downstream effects in Huntingtons disease pathology.",

    "abstract": "The accumulation of manganese ions is crucial for scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protecting the proteome of Deinococcus radiodurans (Dr). However, metal homeostasis still needs to be tightly regulated to avoid toxicity. DR2539, a dimeric transcription regulator, plays a key role in Dr manganese homeostasis. Despite comprising three well-conserved domains: a DNA binding domain, a dimerization domain, and an ancillary domain, both the metal ion activation mechanism and the DNA recognition mechanism remain elusive. In this study, we present biophysical analyses and the structure of the dimerization and DNA binding domains of DR2539 in its holo form and in complex with the 21 bp pseudo-palindromic repeat of the dr1709 promotor region. These findings shed light into the activation and recognition mechanisms. The dimer presents eight manganese binding sites that induce structural conformations essential for DNA binding. The analysis of the protein-DNA interfaces elucidates the significance of Tyr59 and helix H3 sequence in the interaction with the DNA. Finally, the structure in solution as determined by small angle X-ray scattering experiments and supported by AlphaFold modelling provides a model illustrating the conformational changes induced upon metal binding.",

Up to now, a curated dataset of organoids co-cultured with immune cells is not available. To address this gap, we present a new public dataset, comprising both phase-contrast images of murine and patient-derived tumor organoids of one of the deadliest cancer types, the Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma, co-cultured with immune cells, and state-of-the-art algorithms for object detection and segmentation. Our dataset, OrganoIDNetData, encompassing 190 images with 33906 organoids, can be a potential common benchmark for different organoids segmentation protocols, moving beyond the current practice of training and testing these algorithms on isolated datasets.",

    "abstract": "A central problem in cancer immunotherapy with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is the development of resistance, which affects 50% of patients with metastatic melanoma1,2. T cell exhaustion, resulting from chronic antigen exposure in the tumour microenvironment, is a major driver of ICB resistance3. Here, we show that CD38, an ecto-enzyme involved in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) catabolism, is highly expressed in exhausted CD8+ T cells in melanoma and is associated with ICB resistance. Tumour-derived CD38hiCD8+ T cells are dysfunctional, characterised by impaired proliferative capacity, effector function, and dysregulated mitochondrial bioenergetics. Genetic and pharmacological blockade of CD38 in murine and patient-derived organotypic tumour models (MDOTS/PDOTS) enhanced tumour immunity and overcame ICB resistance. Mechanistically, disrupting CD38 activity in T cells restored cellular NAD+ pools, improved mitochondrial function, increased proliferation, augmented effector function, and restored ICB sensitivity. Taken together, these data demonstrate a role for the CD38-NAD+ axis in promoting T cell exhaustion and ICB resistance and establish the efficacy of CD38 directed therapeutic strategies to overcome ICB resistance using clinically relevant, patient-derived 3D tumour models.",

    "abstract": "Immune system control is a major hurdle that cancer evolution must circumvent. The relative timing and evolutionary dynamics of subclones that have escaped immune control remain incompletely characterized, and how immune-mediated selection shapes the epigenome has received little attention. Here, we infer the genome- and epigenome-driven evolutionary dynamics of tumour-immune coevolution within primary colorectal cancers (CRCs). We utilise our existing CRC multi-region multi-omic dataset that we supplement with high-resolution spatially-resolved neoantigen sequencing data and highly multiplexed imaging of the tumour microenvironment (TME). Analysis of somatic chromatin accessibility alterations (SCAAs) reveals frequent somatic loss of accessibility at antigen presenting genes, and that SCAAs contribute to silencing of neoantigens. We observe that strong immune escape and exclusion occur at the outset of CRC formation, and that within tumours, including at the microscopic level of individual tumour glands, additional immune escape alterations have negligible consequences for the immunophenotype of cancer cells. Further minor immuno-editing occurs during local invasion and is associated with TME reorganisation, but that evolutionary bottleneck is relatively weak. Collectively, we show that immune evasion in CRC follows a \"Big Bang\" evolutionary pattern, whereby genetic, epigenetic and TME-driven immune evasion acquired by the time of transformation defines subsequent cancer-immune evolution.",

    "abstract": "Nucleic acid tests (NATs) are essential for biomedical diagnostics. Traditional NATs, often complex and expensive, have prompted the exploration of Toehold-Mediated Strand Displacement (TMSD) circuits as an economical alternative. However, the wide application of TMSD-based reactions is limited by  leakage--the spurious activation of the reaction leading to high background signals and false positives. Here we introduce a new TMSD cascade that recognizes a custom nucleic acid input and generates an amplified output. The system is based on a pair of thermodynamically spring-loaded DNA modules. The binding of a predefined nucleic acid target triggers an intermolecular reaction that activates a T7 promoter, leading to the perpetual transcription of a fluorescent aptamer that can be detected by a smartphone camera. The system is designed to permit the selective depletion of leakage byproducts to achieve high sensitivity and zero-background signal in the absence of the correct trigger. Using Zika virus (ZIKV)- and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-derived nucleic acid sequences, we show that the assay generates a reliable target-specific readout. Native RNA can be directly detected under isothermal conditions, without requiring reverse transcription, with a sensitivity as low as 200 attomole. The modularity of the assay allows easy re-programming for the detection of other targets by exchanging a single sequence domain.

    "abstract": "Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) impose an enormous clinical, social, and economic burden on humankind. For many IFIs, [&ge;] 30% of patients fail therapy with existing antifungal drugs, including the widely used azole class. We previously identified a collection of 13 approved medications that antagonize azole activity. While gain-of-function mutants resulting in antifungal resistance are often associated with reduced fitness and virulence, it is currently unknown how exposure to azole antagonistic drugs impact C. albicans physiology, fitness, or virulence. In this study, we examined how exposure to azole antagonists affected C. albicans phenotype and capacity to cause disease. We discovered that most of the azole antagonists had little impact on fungal growth, morphology, stress tolerance, or gene transcription. However, aripiprazole had a modest impact on C. albicans hyphal growth and increased cell wall chitin content. It also worsened the outcome of disseminated infections in mice at human equivalent concentrations. This effect was abrogated in immunosuppressed mice, indicating an additional impact of aripiprazole on host immunity. Collectively, these data provide proof-of-principle that unanticipated drug-fungus interactions have the potential to influence the incidence and outcomes of invasive fungal disease.\n\nImportanceAs natural inhabitants of the gastrointestinal and reproductive tracts, Candida sp. are routinely exposed to medications consumed by their human host. This study provides new insight into how drugs can modulate the physiology, fitness, and pathogenicity of Candida albicans - one of the most important human fungal pathogens.

    "abstract": "Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and Paratyphi A are the cause of typhoid and paratyphoid fever in humans, which are systemic life-threatening illnesses. Both serovars are exclusively adapted to the human host, where they can cause life-long persistent infection. A distinct feature of these serovars is the presence of a relatively high number of degraded coding sequences coding for metabolic pathways, most likely a consequence of their adaptation to a single host. As a result of convergent evolution, these serovars shared many of the degraded coding sequences although often affecting different genes in the same metabolic pathway. However, there are several coding sequences that appear intact in one serovar while clearly degraded in the other, suggesting differences in their metabolic capabilities. Here, we examined the functionality of metabolic pathways that appear intact in S. Typhi but that show clear signs of degradation in S. Paratyphi A. We found that, in all cases, the existence of single amino acid substitutions in S. Typhi metabolic enzymes, transporters, or transcription regulators resulted in the inactivation of these metabolic pathways. Thus, the inability of S. Typhi to metabolize Glucose-6-Phosphate or 3-phosphoglyceric acid is due to the silencing of the expression of the genes encoding the transporters for these compounds due to point mutations in the transcriptional regulatory proteins. In contrast, its inability to utilize glucarate or galactarate is due to the presence of point mutations in the transporter and enzymes necessary for the metabolism of these sugars. These studies provide additional support for the concept of adaptive convergent evolution of these two human-adapted Salmonella enterica serovars and highlight a limitation of bioinformatic approaches to predict metabolic capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Host-microbe interactions are virtually bidirectional, but how the host affects their symbionts is poorly understood. Here, we report that the host is a critical modulator to regulate the lifestyle switch and pathogenicity heterogeneity of the opportunistic pathogens Serratia marcescens utilizing the Drosophila and bacterium model system. First, we find that Drosophila larvae efficiently outcompete S. marcescens and typically drive a bacterial switch from pathogenicity to commensalism toward the fly. Furthermore, Drosophila larvae reshape the transcriptomic and metabolic profiles of S. marcescens characterized by a lifestyle switch. More important, the host alters pathogenicity and heterogeneity of S. marcescens in the single-cell resolution. Finally, we find that larvae-derived AMPs are required to recapitulate the response of S. marcescens to larvae. Altogether, our findings provide an insight into the pivotal roles of the host in harnessing the life history and heterogeneity of symbiotic bacterial cells, advancing knowledge of the reciprocal relationships between the host and microbiome.",

    "abstract": "The silent pandemic caused by antimicrobial resistance (AMR) requires innovative therapeutic approaches. Human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which are among the most transformative, safe and effective drugs in oncology and autoimmunity, are rarely used for infectious diseases and not yet used for AMR. Here we applied an antigen-agnostic strategy to isolate extremely potent human mAbs against Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) sequence type 147 (ST147), a hypervirulent and pandrug-resistant clonotype which is spreading globally. Isolated mAbs target the bacterial capsule and the O-antigen. Surprisingly, although both capsule- and O-antigen-specific mAbs displayed bactericidal activity in the picomolar range in vitro, only the capsule-specific mAbs were protective against fulminant ST147 bloodstream infection. Protection correlated with in vitro bacterial uptake by macrophages and enchained bacterial growth. Our study describes the only drug able to protect against pandrug-resistant Kp and provides a strategy to isolate mAbs and identify correlates of protection against AMR bacteria.",

Human factors and climate changes make the incidence of melioidosis higher. Soil with high moisture and clay-rich is a suitable residence for B. pseudomallei. Twenty-one isolates of B. pseudomallei were collected and performed by multilocus sequence typing. Among them, eight novel sequence types (STs) of B. pseudomallei were found, while the rest show known STs. Interestingly, ST 56 from two patients was identified as the same region, while ST 90 showed local and global distribution. Among six ST 90 B. pseudomallei, the three isolates were from soil and patients. Clinical ST 90 isolates were traced in the same region as soil ST 90 isolates. Those isolates may correlate with each other by using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) cost-effectively. However, it still needs to prove its correct relatedness.

    "abstract": "The gut microbiota interacts directly with dietary nutrients and has the ability to modify host feeding behavior, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Select gut bacteria digest complex carbohydrates that are non-digestible by the host and liberate metabolites that serve as additional energy sources and pleiotropic signaling molecules. Here we use a gnotobiotic mouse model to examine how differential fructose polysaccharide metabolism by commensal gut bacteria influences host preference for diets containing these carbohydrates. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Bacteroides ovatus selectively ferment fructans with different glycosidic linkages: B. thetaiotaomicron ferments levan with {beta}2-6 linkages, whereas B. ovatus ferments inulin with {beta}2-1 linkages. Since inulin and levan are both fructose polymers, inulin and levan diet have similar perceptual salience to mice. We find that mice colonized with B. thetaiotaomicron prefer the non-fermentable inulin diet, while mice colonized with B. ovatus prefer the non-fermentable levan diet. Knockout of bacterial fructan utilization genes abrogates this preference, whereas swapping the fermentation ability of B. thetaiotaomicron to inulin confers host preference for the levan diet. Bacterial fructan fermentation and host behavioral preference for the non-fermentable fructan are associated with increased neuronal activation in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, a key brain region for appetite regulation. These results reveal that selective nutrient metabolism by gut bacteria contributes to host associative learning of dietary preference, and further informs fundamental understanding of the biological determinants of food choice.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRespiratory tract colonisation with Ureaplasma species has been associated with the development of acute and long-term pulmonary morbidity in preterm infants. Apart from inflammation, the underlying mechanisms of Ureaplasma-driven lung disease are mainly unknown. The present investigation is the first to examine the influence of acute Ureaplasma infection on critical mechanisms of alveolar fluid clearance in the immature lung.\n\nMethodsPrimary rat fetal distal lung epithelial (FDLE) cells were incubated with viable Ureaplasma in the absence or presence of the urease inhibitor flurofamide. Na+ transport and activity of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) and the Na,K-ATPase were determined in Ussing chambers. Barrier integrity, metabolic activity, gene expression, and kinase signalling were also assessed.\n\nResultsWe found a 30-90% decrease of epithelial Na+ transport upon 24 hours of Ureaplasma infection resulting from significant inhibition of ENaC and Na,K-ATPase activities. Notably, Ureaplasma induced phosphorylation of Erk1/2 - a well-known inhibitor of ENaC activity. Moreover, Ureaplasma-driven NH3 production - and not the accompanying pH shift - inhibited the epithelial Na+ transport. Co-incubation with flurofamide entirely restored Na+ transport in Ureaplasma-infected FDLE cells.\n\nConclusionOur data demonstrate that Ureaplasma infection significantly impairs epithelial Na+ transport and subsequent fluid clearance in fetal alveolar cells - most likely by Erk1/2 phosphorylation. We identified NH3 as the mediating virulence factor and were able to restore Na+ transport by inhibiting the Ureaplasma-specific urease. This is the first study to show a functional impairment of pulmonary epithelial cells upon Ureaplasma infection, revealing a potential mechanism of Ureaplasma-driven preterm lung disease.\n\nTake HomeWe report Ureaplasma-induced inhibition of epithelial Na+ transport as a potential mechanism of Ureaplasma-driven preterm lung disease. NH3 is identified as a virulence factor offering a potential therapeutic role for urease inhibitors in colonised infants.",

The C. difficile species can be subdivided into 5 main clades, with Clade 5 currently undergoing speciation from Clades 1-4. Since Clade 5 strains are found more frequently in agricultural animals and can cause zoonotic infections, Clade 5 strains likely have evolved phenotypes that distinguish them from Clade 1-4 strains. Here, we compare the growth properties of Clade 5 strains to Clade 1, 2, and 4 strains using an anaerobic time-lapse microscopy system coupled with automated image analysis. These analyses revealed that Clade 5 strains grow faster than Clade 1, 2, and 4 strains and are more likely to form long chains of cells. Notably, the chaining phenotype was not shared among all Clade 5 strains examined, since 1 of the 9 strains did not form chains. Genomic analyses of the Clade 5 strains revealed that the orientation of the cmr switch, an invertible DNA element controlling the expression of a signal transduction system that regulates chaining, correlates with the propensity of a given Clade 5 strain to form chains. Taken together, Clade 5 strains appear to have distinct growth properties that allow them to inhabit more diverse ecological niches.",

    "abstract": "Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (Cdk7) occupies a central position in cell-cycle and transcriptional regulation owing to its function as both a CDK-activating kinase (CAK) and part of the general transcription factor TFIIH. Cdk7 forms an active complex upon association with Cyclin H and Mat1, and its catalytic activity is regulated by two phosphorylations in the activation segment (T loop): the canonical activating modification at T170 and another at S164. Here we report the crystal structure of the fully activated human Cdk7/Cyclin H/Mat1 complex containing both T-loop phosphorylations. Whereas pT170 coordinates a set of basic residues conserved in other CDKs, pS164 nucleates an arginine network involving all three subunits that is unique to the ternary Cdk7 complex. We identify differential dependencies of kinase activity and substrate recognition on individual phosphorylations within the Cdk7 T loop. The CAK function of Cdk7 is not affected by T-loop phosphorylation, whereas activity towards non-CDK substrates is increased several-fold by phosphorylation at T170. Moreover, dual T-loop phosphorylation at both T170 and S164 stimulates multi-site phosphorylation of transcriptional substrates--the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) and the SPT5 carboxy-terminal repeat (CTR) region. In human cells, Cdk7-regulatory phosphorylation is a two-step process in which phosphorylation of S164 precedes, and may prime, T170 phosphorylation. Thus, dual T-loop phosphorylation can regulate Cdk7 through multiple mechanisms, with pS164 supporting tripartite complex formation and possibly influencing Cdk7 processivity, while the canonical pT170 enhances kinase activity towards critical substrates involved in transcription.",

Just one partially effective drug is available, and new drugs and drug targets would be welcome. The 20S proteasome is a validated drug target for many parasitic infections, including those caused by Plasmodium and Leishmania. We previously showed that anticancer proteasome inhibitors that act through the Schistosoma mansoni 20S proteasome (Sm20S) kill the parasite in vitro. To advance these initial findings, we employed Multiplex Substrate Profiling by Mass Spectrometry (MSP-MS) to define the substrate cleavage specificities of the three catalytic {beta} subunits of purified Sm20S. The profiles in turn were used to design and synthesize subunit-specific optimized substrates that performed two to eight fold better than the equivalent substrates used to measure the activity of the constitutive human proteasome (c20S). These specific substrates also eliminated the need to purify Sm20S from parasite extracts - a single step enrichment was sufficient to accurately measure substrate hydrolysis and its inhibition with proteasome inhibitors. Finally, we show that the substrate and inhibition profiles for the 20S proteasome from the three medically important schistosome species are similar, suggesting that data arising from an inhibitor development campaign that focuses on Sm20S can be extrapolated to the other two targets with consequent time and cost savings.",

    "abstract": "In our pursuit of understanding the protein-metabolite interactome, we introduced PROMIS, a co-fractionation mass spectrometry (CF-MS) technique focusing on biosynthetic and regulatory processes. However, the challenge lies in distinguishing true interactors from coincidental co-elution when a metabolite co-fractionates with numerous proteins. To address this, we integrated two chromatographic techniques-- size exclusion and ion exchange--to enhance the mapping of protein-metabolite interactions (PMIs) in Escherichia coli. This integration aims to refine the PMI network by considering size and charge characteristics, resulting in 994 interactions involving 51 metabolites and 465 proteins. The PMI network is enriched for known and predicted interactions validating our approachs efficacy. Furthermore, the analysis of protein targets for different metabolites revealed novel functional insights, such as the connection between proteinogenic dipeptides and fatty acid biosynthesis. Notably, we uncovered an inhibitory interaction between the riboflavin degradation product lumichrome and orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (PyrE), a key enzyme in de novo pyrimidine synthesis. Lumichrome supplementation mimicked the biofilm formation inhibition observed in a{Delta} pyrE mutant strain, suggesting lumichrome role in integrating pyrimidine and riboflavin metabolism with quorum sensing and biofilm formation. In summary, our integrated chromatographic approach significantly advances PMI mapping, offering novel insights into functional associations and potential regulatory mechanisms in E. coli.\n\nIMPORTANTO_LIManuscripts submitted to Review Commons are peer reviewed in a journal-agnostic way.\nC_LIO_LIUpon transfer of the peer reviewed preprint to a journal, the referee reports will be available in full to the handling editor.\nC_LIO_LIThe identity of the referees will NOT be communicated to the authors unless the reviewers choose to sign their report.\nC_LIO_LIThe identity of the referee will be confidentially disclosed to any affiiliate journals to which the manuscript is transferred.\nC_LI\n\nGUIDELINESO_LIFor reviewers: https://www.reviewcommons.org/reviewers\nC_LIO_LIFor authors: https://www.reviewcommons.org/authors\nC_LI\n\nCONTACTThe Review Commons office can be contacted directly at: office@reviewcommons.org",

    "abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells are an appealing off-the-shelf, allogeneic cellular therapy due to their cytotoxic profile. However, their activity against solid tumors remains suboptimal in part due to the upregulation of NK-inhibitory ligands, such as HLA-E, within the tumor microenvironment. Here, we utilize CRISPR-Cas9 to disrupt the KLRC1 gene (encoding the HLA-E-binding NKG2A receptor) and perform non-viral insertion of a GD2-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) within NK cells isolated from human peripheral blood. Genome editing with CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes yields efficient genomic disruption of the KLRC1 gene with 98% knockout efficiency and specific knock-in of the GD2 CAR transgene as high as 23%, with minimal off-target activity as shown by CHANGE-Seq, in-out PCR, and next generation sequencing. KLRC1-GD2 CAR NK cells display high viability and proliferation, as well as precise cellular targeting and potency against GD2+ human melanoma cells. Notably, KLRC1-GD2 CAR NK cells overcome HLA-E-based inhibition by HLA-E-expressing, GD2+ melanoma cells. Using a single-step, virus-free genome editing workflow, this study demonstrates the feasibility of precisely disrupting inhibitory signaling within NK cells via CRISPR/Cas9 while expressing a CAR to generate potent allogeneic cell therapies against HLA-E+ solid tumors.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput single-cell cytometry data are crucial for understanding involvement of immune system in diseases and responses to treatment. Traditional methods for annotating cytometry data, specifically manual gating and clustering, face challenges in scalability, robustness, and accuracy. In this study, we propose a cytometry masked autoencoder (cyMAE), which offers an automated solution for immunophenotyping tasks including cell type annotation. The cyMAE model is designed to uphold user-defined cell type definitions, thereby facilitating easier interpretation and cross-study comparisons. The cyMAE model operates on a pre-train and fine-tune approach. In the pre-training phase, cyMAE employs Masked Cytometry Modelling (MCM) to learn relationships between protein markers in immune cells solely based on protein expression, without relying on prior information such as cell identity and cell type-specific marker proteins. Subsequently, the pre-trained cyMAE is fine-tuned on multiple specialized tasks via task-specific supervised learning. The pre-trained cyMAE addresses the shortcomings of manual gating and clustering methods by providing accurate and interpretable predictions. Through validation across multiple cohorts, we demonstrate that cyMAE effectively identifies co-occurrence patterns of bound labeled antibodies, delivers accurate and interpretable cellular immunophenotyping, and improves the prediction of subject metadata status. Specifically, we evaluated cyMAE for cell type annotation and imputation at the cellular-level and SARS-CoV-2 infection prediction, secondary immune response prediction against COVID-19, and prediction of the infection stage in COVID-19 progression at the subject-level. The introduction of cyMAE marks a significant step forward in immunology research, particularly in large-scale and high-throughput human immune profiling. This approach offers new possibilities for predicting and interpreting cellular-level and subject-level phenotypes in both health and disease.",

    "abstract": "MotivationLong-read assemblers face challenges in discerning closely related viral or bacterial strains, often collapsing similar strains in a single sequence. This limitation has been hampering metagenome analysis, where diverse strains may harbor crucial functional distinctions.\n\nResultsWe introduce a novel software, HairSplitter, designed to retrieve strains from a strain-oblivious assembly and long reads. The method uses a custom variant calling process to operate with erroneous long reads and introduces a new read clustering algorithm to recover an a priori unknown number of strains. On noisy long reads, HairSplitter can recover more strains while being faster than state-of-the-art tools, both in the viral and the bacterial case.\n\nAvailabilityHairSplitter is freely available on GitHub at github.com/RolandFaure/HairSplitter.\n\nContactroland.faure@irisa.fr",

    "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms behind plant resilience to abiotic stresses is essential for enhancing crop yield and sustainability. This study integrates findings from a comprehensive investigation into the function of the SbPIP2 gene, which encodes an aquaporin protein, in improving the abiotic stress tolerance of transgenic plants. Our integrated approach revealed that transgenic plants overexpressing SbPIP2 significantly reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and exhibit enhanced physiological attributes, including higher seed germination rates, improved growth, early flowering, and better seed setting under stress conditions. Notably, these plants also showed a quicker recovery and completion of their lifecycle post-stress treatment. The transcriptomic analysis provided a deeper understanding of the genetic modifications contributing to stress resilience, highlighting the involvement of genes associated with oxidative stress response, calcium and sugar signaling pathways, stomatal regulation, phytohormone biosynthesis, and flower development. Additionally, the study underscores the central role of abscisic acid (ABA) in mediating stress responses through hormonal regulation, with transgenic plants displaying increased ABA levels due to the upregulation of biosynthesis genes and downregulation of catabolism genes. This hormonal adjustment is critical for stomatal closure, reducing water loss, and enhancing tolerance to abiotic stresses. Our findings elucidate the complex genetic and molecular pathways that underpin abiotic stress tolerance in plants, offering valuable insights for future research aimed at improving crop resilience through genetic engineering, thereby addressing the challenges of climate change and environmental stressors.",

MERCS reporters based on complementation of GFP fragments have been designed to visualize MERCS in real-time, but we find that they do not accurately respond to changes in MERCS content. Here, we utilize split LacZ complementing fragments to develop the first MERCS reporter system (termed SpLacZ-MERCS) that continuously integrates the MERCS information within a cell and generates a fluorescent output. Our system exhibits good organelle targeting, no artifactual tethering, and effective, dynamic tracking of the MERCS level in single cells. The SpLacZ-MERCS reporter was validated by drug treatments and genetic perturbations known to affect mitochondria-ER contacts. The signal-integrating nature of SpLacZ-MERCS may enable systematic identification of genes and drugs that regulate mitochondria-ER interactions. Our successful application of the split LacZ complementation strategy to study MERCS may be extended to study other forms of inter-organellar crosstalk.",

The role of the SR in other processes and the effectors by which it regulates C. difficile physiology are unknown. C. difficile RelQ is a clostridial alarmone synthetase. Deletion of relQ dysregulates C. difficile growth in unstressed conditions, affects susceptibility to antibiotic and oxidative stressors, and drastically reduces biofilm formation. While wild-type C. difficile displays increased biofilm formation in the presence of sub-lethal stress, the {Delta}relQ strain cannot upregulate biofilm production in response to stress. Deletion of relQ slows spore accumulation in planktonic cultures but accelerates it in biofilms. This work establishes biofilm formation and sporulation as alarmone-mediated processes in C. difficile and reveals the importance of RelQ in stress-induced biofilm regulation.",

This approach can focus chemistry-based diagnostics, improve risk assessment, and address data gaps. There is increasing recognition that simultaneously co-occurring mycotoxins, either from single or multiple species, can impact dietary toxicity. Here we evaluate an aflatoxin contaminated kibble with known levels of specific mycotoxins and demonstrate that the abundance of DNA from putative aflatoxigenic Aspergillus spp. correlated with levels of aflatoxin quantified by Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LCMS). Metagenomic data also identified an expansive range of co-occurring fungal taxa which may produce additional mycotoxins.

    "abstract": "Rapid sand filters are established and widely applied technologies for groundwater treatment. Conventionally, intensive aeration is employed to provide oxygen for the oxidation and removal of the main groundwater contaminants. While effective, intensive aeration promotes flocculent iron removal, which results in iron flocs that rapidly clog the filter. In this study, we operated two parallel full-scale sand filters at different aeration intensities to resolve the relative contribution of homogeneous, heterogeneous and biological iron removal pathways, and identify their operational controls. Our results show that mild aeration in the LOW filter (5 mg/L O2pH 6.9) promoted biological iron removal and enabled iron oxidation at twice the rate compared to the intensively aerated HIGH filter (>10mg/L O2,pH 7.4). ESEM images showed distinctive twisted stalk-like Fe solids, biosignatures of Gallionella ferruginea, both in the LOW filter sand coatings as well as in its backwash solids. In accordance, 10 times higher DNA copy numbers of G. ferruginea were found in the LOW filter effluent. Clogging by biogenic FeOx was slower than by chemical FeOx flocs, resulting in lower backwash frequencies and yielding four times more water per run. Ultimately, our results reveal that biological Fe2+ oxidation can be actively controlled and favoured over competing physico-chemical routes. The resulting operational benefits are only starting to be appreciated, with the counterintuitive higher oxidation rates and water yields at lower aeration regimes, and the production of more compact and practically valuable FeOx solids being of outmost interest.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial stress and dysfunction play an important role in many diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases. We previously observed that mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) inhibition can induce tRNA cleavage and tsRNAs (tRNA-derived small non-coding RNAs) generation. However, whether this process is mediated via Angiogenin (ANG), the canonical enzyme responsible for tRNA cleavage, and whether it has a role in regulating the mitochondrial stress response remains to be understood. ANG is linked to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and other conditions where mitochondrial stress plays a role in pathophysiology. Here, we aimed to examine the role of ANG in regulating the translational response to mitochondrial stress. We observed that ANG protected the cells from respiratory complex III and V inhibition specifically. Furthermore, we validated that the tsRNAs generated during mitochondrial and oxidative stress are mediated by ANG, given that their production is abrogated after ANG knock-out (KO). In addition, we observed that ANG-KO altered the tRNA modification status. Namely, we observed that ANG-KO led to the downregulation of queuosine tRNA modifications (tRNA-Q). tRNA-Q itself is related to mitochondrial translation and function. Indeed, we observed that ANG-KO led to reduced mitochondrial respiration and function. ANG altered how the cells respond to mitochondrial stress by altering the dynamic tRNA modification changes occurring during the stress response. We further examined the impact of ANG-KO on stress granules (SG) assembly as well as the knockdown of G3BP1 (core protein of SGs) on tsRNAs generation. Our results indicate that ANG regulates mitochondrial function and stress via tsRNAs generation as well as altering tRNA modifications levels. Our data also indicate that there are no direct links between tRNA cleavage and SG assembly, and both could be parallel systems for translation repression during stress.",

    "abstract": "The highly repetitive and transcriptionally active ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes are exceedingly susceptible to genotoxic stress. Induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in rDNA repeats is associated with ATM-dependent rDNA silencing and nucleolar reorganization where rDNA is segregated into nucleolar caps. However, the regulatory events underlying this response remain elusive. Here, we identify protein UFMylation as essential for rDNA damage response in human cells. We further show the only UFM1-E3-ligase UFL1 and its binding partner DDRGK1 localize to nucleolar caps upon rDNA damage, and that UFL1 loss impairs ATM activation and rDNA transcriptional silencing, leading to reduced rDNA segregation. A first-ever analysis of nuclear and nucleolar UFMylation targets in response to DSBs induction further identified key DNA repair factors including ATM, in addition to chromatin and actin network regulators. Taken together, our data provides the first evidence of an essential role for UFMylation in orchestrating rDNA DSB repair.",

    "abstract": "Non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica cause an estimated 1 million cases of gastroenteritis annually in the United States. These serovars use secreted protein effectors to mimic and reprogram host cellular functions. We previously discovered that the secreted effector SarA (Salmonella anti-inflammatory response activator; also known as SteE) was required for increased intracellular replication of S. Typhimurium and production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10). SarA facilitates phosphorylation of STAT3 through a region of homology with the host cytokine receptor gp130. Here, we demonstrate that a single amino acid difference between SarA and gp130 is critical for the anti-inflammatory bias of SarA-STAT3 signaling. An isoleucine at the pY+1 position of the YxxQ motif in SarA (which binds the SH2 domain in STAT3) causes increased STAT3 phosphorylation and expression of anti-inflammatory target genes. This isoleucine, completely conserved in [~]4000 Salmonella isolates, renders SarA a better substrate for tyrosine phosphorylation by GSK-3. GSK-3 is canonically a serine/threonine kinase that nonetheless undergoes tyrosine autophosphorylation at a motif that has an invariant isoleucine at the pY+1 position. Our results provide a molecular basis for how a Salmonella secreted effector achieves supraphysiological levels of STAT3 activation to control host genes during infection.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial stress and dysfunction play important roles in many pathologies. However, how cells respond to mitochondrial stress is not fully understood. Here, we examined the translational response to electron transport chain (ETC) inhibition and arsenite induced mitochondrial stresses. Our analysis revealed that during mitochondrial stress, tRNA modifications (namely f5C, hm5C, queuosine and its derivatives, and mcm5U) dynamically change to fine tune codon decoding, usage, and optimality. These changes in codon optimality drive the translation of many pathways and gene sets, such as the ATF4 pathway and selenoproteins, involved in the cellular response to mitochondrial stress. We further examined several of these modifications using targeted approaches. ALKBH1 knockout (KO) abrogated f5C and hm5C levels and led to mitochondrial dysfunction, reduced proliferation, and impacted mRNA translation rates. Our analysis revealed that tRNA queuosine (tRNA-Q) is a master regulator of the mitochondrial stress response. KO of QTRT1 or QTRT2, the enzymes responsible for tRNA-Q synthesis, led to mitochondrial dysfunction, translational dysregulation, and metabolic alterations in mitochondria-related pathways, without altering cellular proliferation. In addition, our analysis revealed that tRNA-Q loss led to a domino effect on various tRNA modifications. Some of these changes could be explained by metabolic profiling. Our analysis also revealed that utilizing serum deprivation or alteration with Queuine supplementation to study tRNA-Q or stress response can introduce various confounding factors by altering many other tRNA modifications. In summary, our data show that tRNA modifications are master regulators of the mitochondrial stress response by driving changes in codon decoding.",

    "abstract": "Progesterone production by the corpus luteum is fundamental for establishing and maintaining pregnancy. The pituitary gonadotropin luteinizing hormone (LH) is recognized as the primary stimulus for luteal formation and progesterone synthesis, regardless of species. Previous studies demonstrated an elevation in abundance of genes related to glucose and lipid metabolism during the follicular to luteal transition. However, the metabolic phenotype of these highly steroidogenic cells has not been studied. Herein, we determined acute metabolic changes induced by LH in primary luteal cells and defined pathways required for progesterone synthesis. Untargeted metabolomics analysis revealed that LH induces rapid changes in vital metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, de novo lipogenesis, and hydrolysis of phospholipids. LH stimulated glucose uptake, enhanced glycolysis, and flux of [U-13C6]-labeled glucose-derived carbons into metabolic branches associated with adenosine 5-triphosphate (ATP) and NADH/NADPH production, synthesis of nucleotides, proteins, and lipids, glycosylation of proteins or lipids, and redox homeostasis. Selective use of small molecule inhibitors targeting the most significantly changed pathways, such as glycolysis, TCA cycle, and lipogenesis, uncovered cellular metabolic routes required for LH-stimulated steroidogenesis. Furthermore, LH via the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway triggered post-translational modification of acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACACA) and ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), enzymes involved in de novo synthesis of fatty acids. Inhibition of ACLY and fatty acid transport into mitochondria reduced LH-stimulated ATP, cAMP production, PKA activation, and progesterone synthesis. Taken together, these findings reveal novel hormone-sensitive metabolic pathways essential for maintaining LHCGR/PKA signaling and steroidogenesis in ovarian luteal cells.\n\nSignificanceThe establishment and maintenance of pregnancy require a well-developed corpus luteum, an endocrine gland within the ovary that produces progesterone. Although there is increased awareness of intracellular signaling events initiating the massive production of progesterone during the reproductive cycle and pregnancy, there are critical gaps in our knowledge of the metabolic and lipidomic pathways required for initiating and maintaining luteal progesterone synthesis. Here, we describe rapid, hormonally triggered metabolic pathways, and define metabolic targets crucial for progesterone synthesis by ovarian steroidogenic cells. Understanding hormonal control of metabolic pathways may help elucidate approaches for improving ovarian function and successful reproduction or identifying metabolic targets for developing nonhormonal contraceptives.",

Relying on a uniquely constant apicobasal bipolarity coupled to an actomyosin-driven retrograde surface flow, the tachyzoite has elaborated a molecular machinery to assemble transient anchoring contacts with the environment, which support the traction force required to power a typical helical gliding motility. Combining micropatterning with live, reflection interference contrast and expansion microscopies, we bring first nanoscale evidence that the tachyzoite needs to build only one apical anchoring contact with the substrate, thus spatially defining a minimal force transmission platform over which it can slide. We uncover that the apicobasal driven surface flow is set up in response to extracellular biochemical cues independent of adhesin release and tachyzoite-surface interactions, hence prior to motile activity. Furthermore, to identify the minimal adhesion requirements for helical gliding at the level of individual molecular species, we combine biochemical and biophysical quantitative assays based on tunable surface chemistry and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring. These approaches uncover that glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-parasite interactions are sufficient to promote a productive contact for helical gliding and pave the way for the characterization of the structure and density of the molecules functionally engaged at this essential parasite-substrate mechanosensitive interface.",

We herein demonstrate their exceptional thermal and chemical resilience, suggesting that biofilm structures might withstand standard sterilization, thereby contributing to the persistence of P. aeruginosa infections. Our findings also underscore the impact of environmental factors on Fap proteins, suggesting that orthologs in different Pseudomonas strains adapt to specific environments and roles. Challenging previous assumptions about a simple nucleation role for FapB in promoting FapC aggregation, the study shows a significant influence of FapC on FapB aggregation. The interaction between FapB and FapC is intricate: FapB stabilizes FapC fibrils, while FapC slows down FapB fibrillation but can still serve as a cross-seeding template. This complex interplay is key to understanding their roles in bacterial biofilms. Furthermore, the study highlights distinct differences between Fap and E. colis curli CsgA amyloid, where CsgB assumes a simple unidirectional role in nucleating CsgA fibrillation, emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive understanding of various amyloid systems. This knowledge is vital for developing effective intervention strategies against bacterial infections and leveraging the unique properties of these amyloids in technological applications such as novel bio-nanomaterials or protective coatings.",

    "abstract": "Isoquinolinequinones represent an important family of natural alkaloids with profound biological activities. Heterologous expression of a rare bifunctional indole prenyltransferase /tryptophan indole-lyase enzyme from Streptomyces mirabilis P8-A2 in S. albidoflavus J1074 led to the activation of a putative isoquinolinequinone biosynthetic gene cluster and production of a novel isoquinolinequinone alkaloid, named maramycin (1). The structure of maramycin was determined by analysis of spectroscopic (1D/2D NMR) and MS spectrometric data. The prevalence of this bifunctional biosynthetic enzyme was explored and found to be a recent evolutionary event with only a few representatives in Nature. Maramycin exhibited moderate cytotoxicity against human prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP and C4-2B. The discovery of maramycin (1) enriched the chemical diversity of natural isoquinolinequinones and also provided new insights into crosstalk between the host biosynthetic genes and the heterologous biosynthetic genes in generating new chemical scaffolds.",

    "abstract": "Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) are a key interface between virus and host, and these interactions are important to both viral reprogramming of the host and to host restriction of viral infection. In particular, viral-host PPI networks can be used to further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of tissue specificity, host range, and virulence. At higher scales, viral-host PPI screening could also be used to screen for small-molecule antivirals that interfere with essential viral-host interactions, or to explore how the PPI networks between interacting viral and host genomes co-evolve. Current high-throughput PPI assays have screened entire viral-host PPI networks. However, these studies are time consuming, often require specialized equipment, and are difficult to further scale. Here, we develop methods that make larger-scale viral-host PPI screening more accessible. This approach combines the mDHFR split-tag reporter with the iSeq2 interaction-barcoding system to permit massively-multiplexed PPI quantification by simple pooled engineering of barcoded constructs, integration of these constructs into budding yeast, and fitness measurements by pooled cell competitions and barcode-sequencing. We applied this method to screen for PPIs between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins, screening in triplicate >180,000 ORF-ORF combinations represented by >1,000,000 barcoded lineages. Our results complement previous screens by identifying 74 putative PPIs, including interactions between ORF7A with the taste receptors TAS2R41 and TAS2R7, and between NSP4 with the transmembrane KDELR2 and KDELR3. We show that this PPI screening method is highly scalable, enabling larger studies aimed at generating a broad understanding of how viral effector proteins converge on cellular targets to effect replication.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionCulex quinquefasciatus is one of the most important carriers of human pathogens. The use of insecticides is one of the most important methods of combating this vector. But the genetic resistance created in Culex quinquefasciatus has led to disruption in the fight against this pest. As a result, it is necessary to know the level of resistance in order to fight this vector. Based on this, the present study was conducted with the aim of investigating the prevalence of kdr resistance in Culex quinquefasciatus against organochlorine insecticides in the world.\n\nMethodsThis study was conducted by systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence of kdr resistance and mortality rate in Culex quinquefasciatus against organochlorine insecticides in the world. Based on this, during the search in the scientific databases Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, biooan.org, Embase, ProQuest and Google scholar without time limit until the end of November 2023, all related articles were extracted and analyzed. Statistical analysis of the data was done using fixed and random effects model in meta-analysis, I2 index, Cochrans test and meta-regression by STATA version 17 software.\n\nResultsSeventy articles were included in the meta-analysis process. Based on the findings, the prevalence of Kdr in Culex quinquefasciatus against organochlorine insecticide was estimated at 63.1%. Also, the mortality rate against the insecticide deltamethrin was 46%, DDT 18.5%, permethrin 42.6%, malathion 54.4% and lambdacyhalothrin 53%.\n\nConclusionMore than half of Cx. quinquefasciatus had Kdr. This vector was relatively resistant to DDT and permethrin insecticides and sensitive to malathion, deltamethrin and lambdacyhalothrin. As a result, it is necessary to use effective insecticides to fight this vector in order to prevent the increase of resistance to other insecticides.",

Tc-24 ELISA produced a quantitative result and could detect anti-T. cruzi antibodies in dogs with high sensitivity and specificity.

    "abstract": "Even though alternative RNA splicing was discovered in 1977 (nearly 50 years ago), we still understand very little about most isoforms arising from a single gene, including in which tissues they are expressed and if their functions differ. Human gene annotations suggest remarkable transcriptional complexity, with approximately 252,798 distinct RNA isoform annotations from 62,710 gene bodies (Ensembl v109; 2023), emphasizing the need to understand their biological effects. For example, 256 gene bodies have [&ge;]50 annotated isoforms and 30 have [&ge;]100, where one protein- coding gene (MAPK10) even has 192 distinct RNA isoform annotations. Whether such isoform diversity results from biological noise (i.e., spurious alternative splicing) or whether it represents biological intent and specialized functions (even if subtle) remains a mystery. Recent studies by Aguzzoli-Heberle et al., Leung et al., and Glinos et al. demonstrate long-read RNAseq enables improved RNA isoform quantification for essentially any tissue, cell type, or biological condition (e.g., disease, development, aging, etc.) making it possible to better assess individual isoform expression and function. While each study provided important discoveries related to RNA isoform diversity, deeper exploration is needed. We sought, in part, to quantify real isoform usage across tissues (compared to annotations) and explore whether observed diversity is biological noise or intent. We used long-read RNAseq data from 58 GTEx samples across nine tissues (three brain, two heart, muscle, lung, liver, and cultured fibroblasts) generated by Glinos et al. and found considerable isoform diversity within and across tissues. Cerebellar hemisphere was the most transcriptionally complex tissue (22,522 distinct isoforms; 3,726 unique); liver was least diverse (12,435 isoforms; 1,039 unique). We highlight gene clusters exhibiting high tissue-specific isoform diversity per tissue (e.g., TPM1 expresses 19 in hearts atrial appendage), and specific genes (PAX6 and TPM1) that counterintuitively exhibit evidence that their expressed isoform diversity results from both biological noise and intent. We also validated 447 of the 700 new isoforms discovered by Aguzzoli-Heberle et al. and found that 88 were expressed in all nine tissues, while 58 were specific to a single tissue. This study represents a broad survey of the RNA isoform landscape, demonstrating isoform diversity across nine tissues and emphasizes the need to better understand how individual isoforms from a single gene body contribute to human health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Duckweeds, including the common duckweed Lemna minor, are increasingly used to test eco-evolutionary theories. Yet, despite its popularity and near-global distribution, the understanding of its genetic variation is still limited. It is essential that this is resolved, because of the impact genetic diversity has on experimental responses and scientific understanding.\n\nThrough whole-genome sequencing, we assessed the genetic diversity and population genomic structure of 23 natural Lemna spp. populations from their natural range in Switzerland. We used two distinct analytical approaches, a reference-free kmer approach and the classical reference-based one.\n\nTwo genetic clusters were identified across the species distribution, corresponding to species -level divisions. The first cluster contained the targeted L. minor individuals and the second contained individuals from a cryptic species: Lemna japonica. Within the L. minor cluster, we identified a well-defined population structure with little intra-population genetic diversity but high inter-population diversity. In L. japonica, the population structure was significantly weaker and genetic variation between a subset of populations was as low as within populations.\n\nThis study revealed that Lemna japonica is more widespread than previously thought. Our findings empower more robust genotype-to-phenotype analyses in duckweed ecology and evolution, realizing the full potential of L. minor in eco-evolutionary research.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPancreatic cancer is partly derived from the transdifferentiation of acinar cells into metaplastic ducts that act as precursors of neoplasia and cancer. Tuft cells are solitary chemosensory cells not found in the normal pancreas but arise in metaplasia and neoplasia, gradually disappearing as neoplastic lesions progress to carcinoma. Metaplastic tuft cells (mTCs) functionally suppress tumor progression through communication with the tumor microenvironment, but their fate during progression is unknown.\n\nMethodsTo determine the fate of mTCs during PDA progression, we have created a lineage tracing model that uses a tamoxifen-inducible tuft-cell specific Pou2f3CreERT/+ driver to induce transgene expression, including the lineage tracer tdTomato or cMyc. FlpO-driven, mTC lineage trace models of pancreatic neoplasia (Ptf1aFlpO/+; FSF-KRASG12D/+; Pou2f3CreERT/+; ROSA26LSL-TdTomato/+, \"KF-P2f3T\") and carcinoma (Ptf1aFlpO/+; FSF-KRASG12D/+; Trp53Frt-Exons 2 to 5-Frt/+; Pou2f3CreERT/+; ROSA26LSL-TdTomato/+, \"KPF-P2f3T\") were used to follow mTC fate. Co-immunofluorescence was used to determine the identity of lineage-traced cells throughout the progression of neoplasia and carcinoma.\n\nResultsWe found that mTCs, specifically in the KPF-P2f3T carcinoma model, transdifferentiate spontaneously into neural-like progenitor cells (NRPs), a cell type associated with poor survival in pancreatic cancer patients. This Tuft-to-Neuroendocrine Transition (TNT) does not occur in KF-P2f3T neoplasia until cMyc expression is targeted directly in mTCs.",
