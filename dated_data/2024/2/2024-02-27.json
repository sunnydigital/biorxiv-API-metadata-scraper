    "abstract": "Emotion and cognition involve an intricate crosstalk of neural and endocrine systems that support allostatic processes for maintenance of dynamic equilibrium and rapid adaptation for upcoming challenges. As a hallmark of human endocrine activity, the cortisol awakening response (CAR) is recognized to play a critical role in modulating emotional and executive functions. Yet, the underlying mechanisms of such effects remain elusive. By leveraging pharmacological neuroimaging technique and Hidden Markov Modeling of brain state dynamics, we show that the CAR proactively modulates rapid reconfigurations (state) of large-scale brain networks across multi-task demands. Behaviorally, suppression of CAR proactively and selectively impaired accuracy for emotional discrimination task but not for working memory (WM). In parallel, suppressed CAR led to a decrease in the occurrence rate of brain state dominant to emotional processing, but an increase in brain state linking to executive control under high WM demand. Further energy-based analyses revealed an increase in transition frequency and sequence complexity along with an increased entropy during emotional tasks when suppressed CAR, suggesting a decreased energy supply. Moreover, an increased transition frequency was observed when shifting from neutral to emotional conditions, but an opposite pattern during WM task, with n decreased transition frequency shifts from low to high-executive demands. Our findings establish a causal link between CAR and dynamic allocation of neural resources for emotional and executive functions, suggesting a cognitive neuroendocrine account for CAR-mediated proactive effects and human allostasis.",

    "abstract": "The visual world is richly adorned with texture, which can serve to delineate important elements of natural scenes. In anesthetized macaque monkeys, selectivity for the statistical features of natural texture is weak in V1, but substantial in V2, suggesting that neuronal activity in V2 might directly support texture perception. To test this, we investigated the relation between single cell activity in macaque V1 and V2 and simultaneously measured behavioral judgments of texture. We generated stimuli along a continuum between naturalistic texture and phase-randomized noise and trained two macaque monkeys to judge whether a sample texture more closely resembled one or the other extreme. Analysis of responses revealed that individual V1 and V2 neurons carried much less information about texture naturalness than behavioral reports. However, the sensitivity of V2 neurons, especially those preferring naturalistic textures, was significantly closer to that of behavior compared with V1. The firing of both V1 and V2 neurons predicted perceptual choices in response to repeated presentations of the same ambiguous stimulus in one monkey, despite low individual neural sensitivity. However, neither population predicted choice in the second monkey. We conclude that neural responses supporting texture perception likely continue to develop downstream of V2. Further, combined with neural data recorded while the same two monkeys performed an orientation discrimination task, our results demonstrate that choice-correlated neural activity in early sensory cortex is unstable across observers and tasks, untethered from neuronal sensitivity, and thus unlikely to reflect a critical aspect of the formation of perceptual decisions.\n\nSignificance statementAs visual signals propagate along the cortical hierarchy, they encode increasingly complex aspects of the sensory environment and likely have a more direct relationship with perceptual experience. We replicate and extend previous results from anesthetized monkeys differentiating the selectivity of neurons along the first step in cortical vision from area V1 to V2. However, our results further complicate efforts to establish neural signatures that reveal the relationship between perception and the neuronal activity of sensory populations. We find that choice-correlated activity in V1 and V2 is unstable across different observers and tasks, and also untethered from neuronal sensitivity and other features of nonsensory response modulation.",

This study addresses the gap, capturing data during awake deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery in five chronic pain patients. Patients continuously reported pain levels using the visual analog scale (VAS), and local field potentials (LFP) from key pain-processing structures (ventral parietal medial of the thalamus, VPM; subgenual cingulate cortex, SCC; periaqueductal gray, PVG) were recorded. Our novel AMI analysis revealed that regular spike-like events in the theta/alpha band was associated with higher pain; and regular events in the gamma band was associated with opioid effects. We demonstrate a novel methodology that successfully characterizes spontaneous pain dynamics with human electrophysiological signals, holding potential for advancing closed-loop DBS treatments for chronic pain.",

    "abstract": "Age-related white matter (WM) microstructure maturation and decline occur throughout the human lifespan with a unique trajectory in the brain, complementing the process of gray matter development and degeneration. Normative modeling can establish lifespan reference curves for typical WM microstructural aging patterns by pooling data from many independent studies that span different age ranges. Here, we create such reference curves by harmonizing and pooling diffusion MRI (dMRI)-derived data from ten public datasets (N = 40,898 subjects; age: 3-95 years; 47.6% male). We tested three ComBat harmonization methods to create normative curves for regional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based fractional anisotropy (FA), a widely used metric of WM microstructure, extracted using the ENIGMA-DTI pipeline. ComBat-GAM harmonization provided multi-study trajectories most consistent with neuroscientific knowledge regarding WM maturation peaks. Harmonized FA metrics were used to create lifespan reference curves, which were validated with test-retest data and used to assess the effect of the ApoE4 risk factor for dementia in WM across the lifespan. We found significant associations between ApoE4 and FA in WM regions associated with neurodegenerative disease even in healthy individuals across the lifespan, with regional age-by-genotype interactions. Within-study associations were not affected by normative harmonization, ensuring that large-scale harmonized studies can be conducted across the lifespan, even from distinct age-restricted studies, without compromising individual study findings. Our lifespan reference curves and tools to harmonize new dMRI data to the curves are available through our new Python package, eHarmonize (https://github.com/ahzhu/eharmonize).",

    "abstract": "Detecting attempted movements of a paralyzed limb is a key step for neural interfaces for motor rehabilitation and restoration after a stroke. In this paper, we present a systematic evaluation of electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) activity to decode when stroke patients with severe upper-limb paralysis attempt to move their affected arm. EEG and EMG recordings of 35 chronic stroke patients were analyzed. We trained classifiers to discriminate between rest and movement attempt states relying on brain, muscle, or both types of features combined. Our results reveal that: i) EEG and residual EMG features provide complementary information to detect attempted movements, obtaining significantly higher decoding accuracy when both sources of activity are combined; ii) EMG-based, but not EEG-based, decoding accuracy correlates with the degrees of impairment of the patient; and iii) the percentage of patients that achieve decoding accuracy above the chance level strongly depends on the type of features considered, and can be as low as 50% of them if only ipsilesional EEG is used. These results offer new perspectives to develop improved neurotechnologies that establish a more accurate contingent link between the central and peripheral nervous system after a stroke, leveraging Hebbian learning and facilitating functional plasticity and recovery.",

    "abstract": "1.For decades, it has been hypothesized that anemonefishes are able to live within the stinging tentacles of host sea anemone species because the chemical composition of their mucus layer inhibits or lacks the trigger for firing host nematocysts. However, there is very little molecular evidence for this, beyond suggestions that glycans in the mucus could be key. In this study we assessed these hypotheses by testing Bubble-tip anemone (Entacmaea quadricolor) nematocysts in response to three different mucus sources, before and after anemonefish association. We also profiled the corresponding mucus lipid and glycan composition of anemonefish. Host sea anemones significantly reduced nematocyst firing at acclimated anemonefish mucus compared to mucus from unacclimated individuals. Changes in anemonefish mucus glycan composition became distinguishable three weeks after introduction relative to an anemonefish that was not living in association of a host sea anemone. The glycan composition reverted back to a pre-acclimated composition when profiled 24 hours after anemonefish removal from a host sea anemone. Triggering fewer nematocysts through glycan profile alterations may be an important adaptation that has enabled anemonefish to live long-term in a sea anemone host. However, the delay in mucus response indicates it is not the initial mechanism used by anemonefish to enter a host sea anemone without being stung.",

    "abstract": "Chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CICI) affects up to 75% of cancer survivors between 6-months and 20-years post-treatment. Impairments include memory loss, learning difficulties, inability to concentrate and a decrease in processing speed, all of which can negatively impact quality of life. Several mechanisms are proposed to drive these impairments, with evidence implicating neuroinflammation as a key contributor. However, the time course over which impairments occur is less well-established. Several preclinical studies have focused on acute (0-7 days) and sub-acute (8-days to 12-weeks) time-points following chemotherapy, but few have investigated more longer-term time-points. This study therefore aimed to understand the evolution of cognitive changes following methotrexate (MTX) or 5-flurouracil (5-FU) chemotherapy treatment, assessing three time-points: acute (96-hour), sub-acute (31-days) and chronic (93-days). Further, we investigated whether alterations in cognition were associated with concomitant changes in neuroinflammation, assessed via astrocytic reactivity. Female Sprague Dawley rats received two intraperitoneal injections of MTX, 5-FU or saline and were assessed on the novel object recognition, 5-choice serial reaction time task and Barnes maze. Hippocampal (HIPP) and pre-frontal cortex (PFC) tissue was examined for GFAP expression. Results indicate that both MTX and 5-FU exposure were associated with impairments in spatial memory, task acquisition, and processing speed at 31-days, with impairment ameliorated by 93-days post-treatment. While MTX and 5-FU increased GFAP expression across all time-points, with the largest changes at 96-hours and 31-days, drug-specific and region-specific variations were noted. These results provide valuable insight into the complexity of the neuroinflammatory response in CICI. While neuroinflammation may be a promising therapeutic target, further work is required to fully understand this response, including which aspects to target and at what time-points, to ensure optimal outcomes for cancer patients treated with chemotherapy.",

The popular and standard workflow for single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis applies feature selection, dimensional reduction, and clustering on the gene expression values quantified by read counts, but alternative approaches using a simple classification of a gene to \"on\" and \"off\" (i.e., binarization of the gene expression) has been proposed for classifying cells and other downstream analyses. Here, we demonstrate that a direct concatenation of the binarized scRNA-seq data and the standard single cell ATAC-seq data is sufficient and effective for integrated clustering analysis, after applying term-frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and single value decomposition (also called latent semantic indexing, LSI) algorithms to the combined data, when the two modalities of omic data are collected using paired multiomic technology. This proposed approach avoids the need for converting scATAC-seq data to gene activity scores for combined analysis and furthermore enables a direct investigation into the contribution of each data type to resolving cell type identity.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput time-lapse microscopy has allowed researchers to monitor individual cells as they grow into colonies and react to treatments, but a deeper understanding of the data obtained after image analysis is still lacking. This is partly due to the biological and computational challenges related to long-running experiments and single-cell tracking. In this work, we present the Clonal Variability Simulator (CloVarS), a Python tool for generating synthetic data of single-cell lineage trees to model time-lapse microscopy experiments. After colony initialization, each individual cell is simulated for a given number of simulation frames. Over the course of the simulation, cells are able to migrate, enter mitosis (divide), and enter apoptosis (die). These events are determined by distributions of cell division and death times, which can be inferred from and fit to experimental data. Colonies have an adjustable fitness memory, meaning cells are able to inherit their parent cells fitness (i.e. their parents time to division/death) to a higher or lesser degree. Arbitrary treatments are able to be delivered to colonies at any time point, modifying their division and death distributions, and fitness memory. CloVarS is an important asset for quickly exploring colony fitness dynamics, testing biological hypotheses, bench-marking cell tracking algorithms, and ultimately improving our understanding of single-cell lineage data.",

    "abstract": "In the era of precision medicine, performing comparative analysis over diverse patient populations is a fundamental step towards tailoring healthcare interventions. However, the critical aspect of equitably selecting molecular features across multiple patients is often overlooked. To address this challenge, we introduce FALAFL (FAir muLti-sAmple Feature seLection), an algorithmic approach based on combinatorial optimization. FALAFL is designed to bridge the gap between molecular feature selection and algorithmic fairness, ensuring a fair selection of molecular features from all patient samples in a cohort.\n\nWe have applied FALAFL to the problem of selecting lineage-informative CpG sites within a cohort of colorectal cancer patients subjected to low read coverage single-cell methylation sequencing. Our results demonstrate that FALAFL can rapidly and robustly determine the optimal set of CpG sites, which are each well covered by cells across the vast majority of the patients, while ensuring that in each patient a high proportion of these sites have good read coverage. An analysis of the FALAFL-selected sites reveals that their tumor lineage-informativeness exhibits a strong correlation across a spectrum of diverse patient profiles. Furthermore, these universally lineage-informative sites are highly enriched in the inter CpG island regions.\n\nFALAFL integrates equity considerations into the molecular feature selection from single-cell sequencing data obtained from a patient cohort.

Here, we ask whether the dynamic mechanical forces that must arise during villous development might influence fusion, and explore this question using in vitro choriocarcinoma trophoblast models. We demonstrate that mechanical stress patterns arise around sites of localized fusion in cell monolayers, in patterns that match computational predictions of villous morphogenesis. We then externally apply these mechanical stress patterns to cell monolayers and demonstrate that equibiaxial compressive stresses (but not uniaxial or equibiaxial tensile stresses) enhance expression of the syndecan-1 marker of fusion. These findings suggest that the mechanical stresses that contribute towards sculpting the placental villi may also impact fusion in the developing tissue. We then extend this concept towards 3D cultures and demonstrate that fusion can be enhanced by applying low isometric compressive stresses to spheroid models, even in the absence of an inducing agent. These results indicate that mechanical stimulation is a potent activator of cellular fusion, suggesting novel avenues to improve experimental reproductive modelling, placental tissue engineering, and understanding disorders of pregnancy development.",

Ten healthy adult participants were scanned twice in an OPM-MEG system, and Beamformer source localisation was employed to obtain source time series within 62 cortical brain regions. Multivariate transfer entropy (mTE) was used to quantify directed connectivity, with lags ranging from 1 to 10 time points. Our findings showed that out-degree connectivity (node to network) in somatomotor and attention networks was higher than in other networks. In contrast, in-degree connectivity (network to node) was not different between networks. Longer time lags were associated with shorter physical distances between nodes. Transfer entropy networks demonstrated a small-world network topology, reinforcing the biological plausibility of our findings. Brain connections with higher transfer entropy values exhibited a stronger Phase Lag Index and Pearsons correlation coefficient than non-significant transfer entropy connections, suggesting a relationship between directed and non-directed connectivity measures. All results were consistent across the two scans. OPM-MEG research is likely to expand significantly, and based on our preliminary findings, we propose that directed connectivity measures may provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of brain communication.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how neural populations interact is crucial to understand brain function. Most common approaches to infer neural interactions are based on Granger causality (GC) analyses and effective connectivity (EC) models of neural time series. However, an in-depth investigation of the similarity and complementarity of these approaches is currently lacking. GC and EC are classically thought to provide complementary information about the interdependence between neural signals. Whereas GC quantifies the amount of predictability between time series and it is interpreted as a measure of information flow, EC quantifies the amount and sign of the interaction, and it is often interpreted as the causal influence that a neural unit exert over another. Here, we show that, in the context of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data analysis and first-order autoregressive models, GC and EC share common assumptions and are mathematically related. More precisely, by defining a  corrected version of GC accounting for unequal noise variances affecting the source and target node, we show that the two measures are linked by an approximately quadratic relation, where positive or negative values of EC are associated with identical values of GC. While the relation is obtained in limit of infinite sampling time, we use simulations to show that it can be observed in finite data samples as classically observed in neuroimaging studies, provided sufficiently long sampling, multiple sessions or group averaging. Finally, we compare the GC and EC analyses on fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, and obtain results consistent with simulation outcomes. While GC and EC analyses do not provide reliable estimates at the single subject or single connection level, they become stable at the group level (more than approximately 20 subjects), where the predicted relation between GC and EC can be clearly observed from the data. To conclude, our study provides a common mathematical framework to make grounded methodological choices in the reconstruction and analysis of directed brain networks from neuroimaging time series.",

    "abstract": "Upon infection, mammals utilize either disease resistance, which seeks to eliminate pathogens at the cost of potential tissue damage, or disease tolerance, which reduces physiological damage without killing the pathogen. Newborns, constrained by limited energy reserves, predominantly rely on disease tolerance strategies to cope with infection. However, this approach may fail as pathogen levels surpass a critical threshold, prompting a shift to dysregulated immune responses that can lead to excessive inflammation and, consequently, neonatal sepsis, a condition with significant mortality risk. The mechanisms governing the interplay between disease tolerance and resistance in newborns remain poorly understood. Here, we compare infection defense strategies of sepsis survivors and non-survivors in a Staphylococcus epidermidis-infected preterm piglet model, mimicking sepsis in preterm infants. Our findings show that compared to non-survivors, sepsis survivors showed elevated disease resistance during early infection, with a stronger disease tolerance in later stages. In contrast, animals succumbing to sepsis showed limited disease resistance after infection and weaker tolerance phenotype with dysregulated immune responses at later time points, including clear signs of respiratory and metabolic acidosis, together with exaggerated inflammation and organ dysfunctions. Hepatic transcriptomics at euthanasia revealed a strong association of tolerance phenotype in survivors with enhanced oxidative phosphorylation, dampened glycolysis and innate and adaptive immune signaling. Plasma metabolomics confirmed our transcriptomic results, highlighting a tolerance phenotype in neonatal infection survivors. This was characterized by rewired metabolic regulations that emphasize mitochondrial activities, including upregulation of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and vital interconnected pathways. Our findings suggest potential mechanisms of host metabolism to control a delicate balance of defense strategies to survive newborn infection. Further, metabolic regulations related to disease tolerance can be exploited to discover novel therapeutics for neonatal infection.",

    "abstract": "Multicellular organisms must have robust development to ensure physiological stability in the face of environmental changes or perturbations. While various mechanisms contributing to developmental robustness have been identified at the subcellular level, those at the intercellular and tissue level remain largely unknown. Our study explores this question using an in vitro directed differentiation model of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into lung progenitor cells. Integrated analysis of single-cell transcriptomes and high-density cell lineage trees (CLTs) of the same colonies allowed a fine-resolution recapitulation of known cell types, as well as their differentiation hierarchies and developmental trajectories. Most importantly, we observed stable cell type compositions among many sub-CLTs across biological replicates. Systematic comparison among CLTs by a novel computational framework for CLT alignment suggests that stereotypical development extends beyond stable cell type composition to a degree of significant resemblance in sub-CLT topology. The existence of such sub-CLTs resembling each other not only deepens our understanding of developmental robustness by demonstrating the existence of a stereotyped program, but also suggests a novel perspective for the function of specific cell types in the context of stereotyped sub-CLTs.",

    "abstract": "Gendered divisions of labor are a feature of every known contemporary hunter-gatherer (forager) society. While gender roles are certainly flexible, and prominent and well-studied cases of female hunting do exist, it is more often men who hunt. A new study (Anderson et al., 2023) surveyed ethnographically known foragers and found that women hunt in 79% of foraging societies, with big-game hunting occurring in 33%. Based on this single type of labor, which is one among dozens performed in foraging societies, the authors question the existence of gendered division of labor altogether. As a diverse group of hunter-gatherer experts, we find that claims that foraging societies lack or have weak gendered divisions of labor are contradicted by empirical evidence. We conducted an in-depth examination of Anderson et al. (2023) data and methods, finding evidence of sample selection bias and numerous coding errors undermining the papers conclusions. Anderson et al. (2023) have started a useful dialogue to ameliorate the popular misconception that women never hunt. However, their analysis does not contradict the wide body of empirical evidence for gendered divisions of labor in foraging societies. Furthermore, a myopic focus on hunting diminishes the value of contributions that take different forms and downplays the trade-offs foragers of both sexes routinely face. We caution against ethnographic revisionism that projects Westernized conceptions of labor and its value onto foraging societies.",

    "abstract": "Biological processes in soil pores are critical to crop nutrition and productivity, but live observations of these processes at that scale have been difficult to accomplish. To address this challenge, we have developed new techniques for the fabrication of microcosms dedicated to live imaging of the rhizosphere which incorporate the ability to control water content in transparent soil. Chambers were assembled using poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) parts fabricated by injection moulding and subsequently joined to glass slides. The control of liquid fluxes in the microcosm was achieved by syringes passing through the PDMS parts or through custom made PDMS sponges. We then tested various low refractive index materials for the fabrication of transparent soils and carried out live microscopy using Fluorescence Light Sheet microscopy. The proposed fabrication techniques are modular and enabled the construction of a wide range of experimental systems, including split chamber systems for the control of water content in soil, heterogeneous distribution of water content, monitoring of dye tracers, and live observation of plant roots. Using the techniques, we show how plant roots increase water infiltration through increased permeability of dry soil layers. This study therefore establishes that material property control and microfabrication in model rhizosphere systems can greatly enhance our understanding of plant-soil interactions.",

However, EDA is underutilized in real-world, population-level research and clinical practice because of a paucity of remote measurement capabilities on commodity devices. The current study examined the capabilities of continuous remote measurement of EDA at scale to quantify physiological changes in the context of diurnal and circadian rhythms, demographic differences, high arousal contexts such as public holidays and high arousal moments (e.g., the Super Bowl). We first demonstrated the accuracy of a novel EDA sensor developed for the Fitbit Sense 2 wearable device within a controlled, arousal-inducing experiment. We then retrospectively analyzed 10 million hours of continuous EDA data collected from over 16,000 people. We show that continuously sampled in-situ EDA from Sense 2 has similar population-level diurnal patterns as those established from more tightly controlled in-lab experiments. Following this, variation of SCL across day of the week and season are presented. Finally, EDA dynamics occurring in response to commonly held stressful or exciting events such as Thanksgiving and the Super Bowl are described which we interpret as a natural experiment eliciting autonomic arousal.",

    "abstract": "Impaired spinal cord vascular function contributes to numerous neurological pathologies, making it important to be able to noninvasively characterize these changes. Here, we propose a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-based method to map spinal cord vascular reactivity (SCVR). We used a hypercapnic breath-holding task, monitored with end-tidal CO2 (PETCO2), to evoke a systemic vasodilatory response during concurrent blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI. SCVR amplitude and hemodynamic delay were mapped at the group level in 27 healthy participants as proof-of-concept of the approach, and then in two highly-sampled participants to probe feasibility/stability of individual SCVR mapping. Across the group and the highly-sampled individuals, a strong ventral SCVR amplitude was initially observed without accounting for local regional variation in the timing of the vasodilatory response. Shifted breathing traces (PETCO2) were used to account for temporal differences in the vasodilatory response across the spinal cord, producing maps of SCVR delay. These delay maps reveal an earlier ventral and later dorsal response and demonstrate distinct gray matter regions concordant with territories of arterial supply. The SCVR fMRI methods described here enable robust mapping of spatiotemporal hemodynamic properties of the human spinal cord. This noninvasive approach has exciting potential to provide early insight into pathology-driven vascular changes in the cord, which may precede and predict future irreversible tissue damage and guide the treatment of several neurological pathologies involving the spine.",

    "abstract": "Humans are adept at extracting and learning sequential patterns from sensory input. This ability enables predictions about future states, resulting in anticipation both on a behavioral and neural level. Stimuli deviating from predictions usually evoke higher neural and hemodynamic activity than predicted stimuli. This difference indicates increased surprise, or prediction error signaling in the context of predictive coding. However, interindividual differences in learning performance and uncertainty have rarely been taken into account. Under Bayesian formulations of cortical function, surprise should be strongest if a subject makes incorrect predictions with high confidence.\n\nIn the present study, we studied the impact of subjective confidence on imaging markers of predictive processing. Participants viewed visual object sequences of varying predictability over multiple days. After each day, we instructed them to complete partially presented sequences and to rate their confidence in the decision. During fMRI scanning, participants saw sequences that either confirmed predictions, deviated from them, or were random. We replicated findings of increased BOLD responses to surprising input in the ventral visual stream. In line with our hypothesis, response magnitude increased with the level of confidence after the training phase. Interestingly, the activity difference between predictable and random input also scaled with confidence: In the anterior cingulate, predictable sequences elicited higher activity for low levels of confidence, but lower activity for high levels of confidence. In summary, we showed that confidence is a crucial moderator of the link between predictive processing and BOLD activity.",

    "abstract": "Pain is a major non-motor symptom of Parkinsons disease (PD). The alterations in the descending pain inhibitory system (DPIS) have been reported to trigger hyperalgesia in PD patients. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the current study, dopaminergic nigrostriatal lesions were induced in rats by injecting 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into their medial forebrain bundle. The neural mechanisms underlying changes in nociception in the orofacial region of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats was examined by injecting formalin into the vibrissa pad. The 6-OHDA-lesioned rats were seen to exhibit increased frequency of face-rubbing and more c-Fos immunoreactive (c-Fos-IR) cells in the trigeminal spinal subnucleus caudalis (Vc), confirming hyperalgesia. Examination of the number of c-Fos-IR cells in the DPIS nuclei [including the midbrain ventrolateral periaqueductal gray, the locus coeruleus, the nucleus raphe magnus, and paraventricular nucleus (PVN)] showed that 6-OHDA-lesioned rats exhibited a significantly lower number of c-Fos-IR cells in the magnocellular division of the PVN (mPVN) after formalin injection compared to sham-operated rats. Moreover, the 6-OHDA-lesioned rats also exhibited significantly lower plasma oxytocin (OT) concentration and percentage of oxytocin-immunoreactive (OT-IR) neurons expressing c-Fos protein in the mPVN and dorsal parvocellular division of the PVN (dpPVN), which secrete the analgesic hormone OT upon activation by nociceptive stimuli, when compared to the sham-operated rats. The effect of OT on hyperalgesia in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats was examined by injecting formalin into the vibrissa pad after intracisternal administration of OT, and the findings showed a decrease in the frequency of face rubbing and the number of c-Fos-IR cells in the Vc. In conclusion, these findings confirm presence of hyperalgesia in PD patients, potentially due to suppression of the analgesic effects of OT originating from the PVN.",

Unlike standard paradigms with unconstrained connectivity, here both networks have the same connectivity but they have different biophysical parameters, reflecting uncertainty in neuronal and synaptic properties. We find that a connectome is often insufficient to constrain the dynamics of networks that perform a specific task, illustrating the difficulty of inferring function from connectivity alone. However, recordings from a small subset of neurons can remove this degeneracy, producing dynamics in the student that agree with the teacher. Our theory can also prioritize which neurons to record from to most efficiently infer unmeasured network activity. Our analysis shows that the solution spaces of connectome-constrained and unconstrained models are qualitatively different, and provides a framework to determine when such models yield consistent dynamics.",

Herein, we introduce the nano-positioning matrix (NPMx) technique capable of superimposing optical and non-optical modalities for a single-EP orthogonal analysis. The NPMx technique is realized by ultraviolet-mediated micropatterning to reduce the stochasticity of Brownian motion. While providing a systematic orthogonal measurement of a single EP via total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, the NPMx technique is compatible with low-yield samples and can be utilized for non-biased electrostatic capture and enhanced positive immunogold sorting. The success of the NPMx technique thus provides a novel platform by marrying already trusted optical and non-optical techniques at a single-EP resolution.",

We collected raw two-channel prefrontal electroencephalography and photoplethysmography signals of 19 subjects using EMOTAIs headband while performing the proposed exercise every workday for 2 weeks straight. Physiological metrics such as heart rate, heart rate variability, and absolute power of the brain waves were extracted before and during the exercise to measure its effectiveness. A marked increase in beta wave power was observed, along with a significant increase in both heart rate and heart rate variability.

Using an architecture based on advances in deep signal processing, we scale Evo to 7 billion parameters with a context length of 131 kilobases (kb) at single-nucleotide, byte resolution. Trained on whole prokaryotic genomes, Evo can generalize across the three fundamental modalities of the central dogma of molecular biology to perform zero-shot function prediction that is competitive with, or outperforms, leading domain-specific language models. Evo also excels at multielement generation tasks, which we demonstrate by generating synthetic CRISPR-Cas molecular complexes and entire transposable systems for the first time. Using information learned over whole genomes, Evo can also predict gene essentiality at nucleotide resolution and can generate coding-rich sequences up to 650 kb in length, orders of magnitude longer than previous methods. Advances in multi-modal and multi-scale learning with Evo provides a promising path toward improving our understanding and control of biology across multiple levels of complexity.",

    "abstract": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encodes four viral Fc-gamma receptors (vFc{gamma}Rs) that counteract antibody-mediated activation in vitro, but their role in infection and pathogenesis is unknown. To examine the in vivo function of vFc{gamma}Rs in animal hosts closely related to humans, we identified and characterized vFc{gamma}Rs encoded by rhesus CMV (RhCMV). We demonstrate that Rh05, Rh152/151 and Rh173 represent the complete set of RhCMV vFc{gamma}Rs, each displaying functional similarities to their respective HCMV orthologs with respect to antagonizing host Fc{gamma}R activation in vitro. When RhCMV-seronegative rhesus macaques were infected with vFc{gamma}R-deleted RhCMV, peak plasma viremia levels and anti-RhCMV antibody responses were comparable to wildtype infections. However, the duration of plasma viremia was significantly shortened in immunocompetent, but not in CD4+ T cell-depleted animals. Since vFc{gamma}Rs were not required for superinfection, we conclude that vFc{gamma}Rs delay control by virus-specific adaptive immune responses, particularly antibodies, during primary infection.",

    "abstract": "Distinct, seemingly independent, cellular pathways affecting intracellular machineries or extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and organization, have been implicated in aneurysm formation. One of the key genes associated with the pathology in both humans and mice is Lysyl oxidase (LOX), a secreted ECM-modifying enzyme, highly expressed in medial vascular smooth muscle cells. To dissect the mechanisms leading to aneurysm development, we conditionally deleted Lox in smooth muscle cells. We find that cytoskeletal organization is lost following Lox deletion. Cell culture assays and in vivo analyses demonstrate a cell-autonomous role for LOX affecting myosin light chain phosphorylation and cytoskeletal assembly resulting in irregular smooth muscle contraction. These results not only highlight new intracellular roles for LOX, but notably they link between multiple processes leading to aneurysm formation suggesting LOX coordinates ECM development, cytoskeletal organization and cell contraction required for media development and function.",

    "abstract": "About 30% of the population are nasal carriers of Staphylococcus aureus, a leading cause of bacteremia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, skin and soft tissue infections. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria, in particular, are an increasing problem in both hospital and community settings. In this study, we sought to determine the cellular consequences of long-term exposure of S. aureus to the antimicrobial peptide stereo-isomers, DGL13K and LGL13K. Both peptides selected for mutations in the chorismate/menaquinone biosynthetic pathway, which resulted in increased resistance to LGL13K but not DGL13K. DGL13K-selected isolates showed a mutation in aroF, while menA and menH were mutated in LGL13K-selected isolates. The latter also contained a mutation of frsA. The peptide-selected isolates exhibited golden coloration, suggesting increased production of the carotenoid staphyloxanthin, which could enhance resistance to cationic AMPs. The peptide-selected isolates grew as small colony variants, which have also been associated with resistance to AMPs. Addition of menaquinone to the growth medium reduced the generation time of DGL13K-selected mutants, but not LGL13K-selected mutants. Instead, the latter showed greatly reduced ATP-levels, suggesting defective electron transport, which is also associated with menadione auxotrophism. The mechanisms behind the differential effect of DGL13K and LGL13K on S. aureus resistance remain to be elucidated. The finding that DGL13K induced resistance to the stereo-isomer LGL13K but not to DGL13K itself, suggests that peptide primary structure is responsible for inducing bacterial defense mechanisms but the peptide secondary structure determines if the defense mechanisms are effective against each peptide.",

Here, we report the mechanism of sensory adaptation in the Pil-Chp mechanosensory system, which the important human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses to sense mechanical stimuli during surface exploration. Using biochemistry, genetics, and cell biology, we discovered that the enzymes responsible for adaptation, a methyltransferase and a methylesterase, are segregated to opposing cell poles as P. aeruginosa explore surfaces. By coordinating the localization of both enzymes, we found that the Pil-Chp response regulators influence local receptor methylation, the molecular basis of bacterial sensory adaptation. We propose a model in which adaptation during mechanosensing spatially resets local receptor methylation, and thus Pil-Chp signaling, to modulate the pathway outputs, which are involved in P. aeruginosa virulence. Despite decades of bacterial sensory adaptation studies, our work has uncovered an unrecognized mechanism that bacteria use to achieve adaptation to sensory stimuli.",

    "abstract": "In the Arctic, phytoplankton blooms are recurring phenomena occurring during the spring-summer seasons and influenced by the strong polar seasonality. Besides, bloom dynamics is affected by nutrient availability, especially nitrogen, which is the main limiting nutrient in the Arctic. This study aimed to investigate the changes in an Arctic microbial community during a phytoplankton bloom with a special focus on the nitrogen cycle. Using metagenomic and metatranscriptomic samples from the Dease Strait (Canada) from March to July (2014), we reconstructed 176 metagenome-assembled genomes. Bacteria dominated the microbial community, although archaea reached up to 25% of genomic abundance in early spring, when Nitrososphaeria archaea actively expressed genes associated with ammonia oxidation to nitrite (amt, amoA, nirK). The resulting nitrite was presumably further oxidized to nitrate by a Nitrospinota bacterium that highly expressed a nitrite oxidoreductase gene (nxr). Since May, the constant increase in chlorophyll a indicated the occurrence of a phytoplankton bloom, promoting the successive proliferation of different groups of chemoorganotrophic bacteria (Bacteroidetes, Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria). These bacterial taxa showed different strategies to obtain nitrogen, whether it be from organic or inorganic sources, according to the expression patterns of genes encoding transporters for nitrogen compounds. In contrast, during summer, the chemolithotrophic organisms thriving during winter, reduced their relative abundance and the expression of their catabolic genes. Based on the functional analysis of our data, we see a transition from a community where nitrogen-based chemolitotrophy plays a relevant role, to a chemoorganotrophic community based on the carbohydrates released during the phytoplankton bloom, where different groups specialize in different nitrogen sources.",

The dominant positive regulator of TSST-1 is the SaeRS two-component system (TCS), and we identified phenazopyridine hydrochloride (PP-HCl) that repressed production of TSST-1 by inhibiting the kinase function of SaeS. PP-HCl competed with ATP for binding of the kinase SaeS leading to decreased phosphorylation of SaeR and reduced expression of TSST-1 as well as several other secreted virulence factors known to be regulated by SaeRS. PP-HCl targets virulence of S. aureus, but it also decreases the impact of TSST-1 on human lymphocytes without affecting the healthy vaginal microbiota.

Many potential drugs for the treatment of tuberculosis show excellent activity against M. tuberculosis in vitro, but lack significant activity in vivo when administered traditionally by either oral or injection delivery routes. Even though previous researches revealed that inhaled administration method can enhance the efficacy of drugs against mycobacteria, while this evaluating process was complicated and time-consuming by using wild type M. tuberculosis. Conversely, our research uncovered that the inhalation administration model using strains of autoluminescent M. tuberculosis may provide a more rapid, non-invasive, lung-targeted mid-throughput method, may avoid significant toxic effects on other organs, for evaluating the anti-tuberculosis activity of compounds in mouse models of infection. The live relative light units, quantifying the light emitted by autoluminescent M. tuberculosis H37Rv, can be used to preliminarily evaluate the therapeutic effect of different drug doses, which can significantly shorten the evaluation time. This model offers the ability to assess the efficacy of new lead compounds and TB drugs that can be administered by inhalation.",

From its cellular localization in the cell membrane, aggregates of BC1280 nucleate the polymerization of CalY, which further incorporates TasA into nascent pili. Additionally, BC1280 modulates the expression of EPS via an uncharacterized pathway that is activated by a protease and an ECF-type sigma factor.

While IP6 is known to be critical for the life cycle of HIV-1, its significance in MLV remains unexplored. We find that IP6 is indeed important for MLV replication. It significantly enhances endogenous reverse transcription (ERT) in MLV. Additionally, a pelleting-based assay reveals that IP6 can stabilize MLV cores, thereby facilitating ERT. We find that IP5 and IP6 are packaged in MLV particles. However, unlike HIV-1, MLV depends upon the presence of IP6 and IP5 in target cells for successful infection. This IP6/5 requirement for infection is reflected in impaired reverse transcription observed in IP6/5-deficient cell lines. In summary, our findings demonstrate the importance of capsid stabilization by IP6/5 in the replication of diverse retroviruses; we suggest possible reasons for the differences from HIV-1 that we observed in MLV.",

Here, using human post-mitotic neurons with rare familial Alzheimers disease (FAD) mutations, we identify hundreds of reproducibly dysregulated genes and thousands of miswired loops prior to amyloid accumulation and tau phosphorylation. Single loops do not predict expression changes; however, the severity and direction of change in mRNA levels and single-cell burst frequency strongly correlate with the number of FAD-gained or -lost promoter-enhancer loops. Classic architectural proteins CTCF and cohesin do not change occupancy in FAD-mutant neurons. Instead, we unexpectedly find TAATTA motifs amenable to binding by DLX homeodomain transcription factors and changing noncoding RNAPolII signal at FAD-dynamic promoter-enhancer loops. DLX1/5/6 mRNA levels are strongly upregulated in FAD-mutant neurons coincident with a shift in excitatory-to-inhibitory gene expression and miswiring of multi-loops connecting enhancers to neural subtype genes. DLX1 overexpression is sufficient for loop miswiring in wildtype neurons, including lost and gained loops at enhancers with tandem TAATTA arrays and singular TAATTA motifs, respectively. Our data uncover a genome structure-function relationship between multi-loop miswiring and dysregulated excitatory and inhibitory transcriptional programs during lineage commitment of human neurons homozygously-engineered with rare FAD mutations.",

    "abstract": "Thioredoxin1 (Trx1) is a major cytoplasmic thiol oxidoreductase protein involved in redox signaling. This function is rendered by a rapid electron transfer reaction during which Trx1 reduces its substrate and itself becomes oxidized. In this reaction, Trx1 forms a transient disulfide bond with the substrate which is unstable and therefore identification of Trx1 substrates is technically challenging. This process maintains the cellular proteins in a balanced redox state and ensures cellular homeostasis. Trx1 levels are reduced in some neurodegenerative diseases; therefore, understanding the interactions between Trx1 and its substrates in neurons could have significant therapeutic implications. We utilized a transgenic mouse model expressing a Flag-tagged mutant form of Trx1 that can form stable disulfide bonds with its substrates allowing identification of the Trx1 interacting proteins. The involvement of Trx1 has been suggested in autophagy, we aimed to investigate Trx1 substrate after pharmacologic induction of autophagy in primary hippocampal neurons. Treatment of primary neurons by rapamycin, a standard autophagy inducer, caused significant reduction of neurite outgrowth and alterations in the cytoskeleton. Through immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we have identified 77 Trx1 interacting proteins which were associated with a wide range of cellular functions including a major impact on cytoskeletal organization. The results were confirmed in Trx1 knocked-down cells and in nucleofected primary neurons. Our study suggests a novel role for Trx1 in regulation of neuronal cytoskeleton organization, marking the first investigation of Trx1-interacting proteins in primary neurons and confirming the multifaceted role of Trx1 in physiological and pathological states.",

    "abstract": "In the field of psychological science, behavioral performance in computer-based cognitive tasks often exhibits poor reliability. The absence of reliable measures of cognitive processes contributes to non-reproducibility in the field and impedes investigation of individual differences. Specifically in visual search paradigms, response time-based measures have shown poor test-retest reliability and internal consistency across attention capture and distractor suppression, but one study has demonstrated the potential for oculomotor measures to exhibit superior reliability. Therefore, in this study, we investigated three datasets to compare the reliability of learning-dependent distractor suppression measured via distractor fixations (oculomotor capture) and latency to fixate the target (fixation times). Our findings reveal superior split-half reliability of oculomotor capture compared to that of fixation times regardless of the critical distractor comparison, with the reliability of oculomotor capture in most cases falling within the range that is acceptable for the investigation of individual differences. We additionally find that older adults have superior oculomotor reliability compared with young adults, potentially addressing a significant limitation in the aging literature of high variability in response time measures due to slower responses. Our findings highlight the utility of measuring eye movements in the pursuit of reliable indicators of distractor processing and the need to further test and develop additional measures in other sensory domains to maximize statistical power, reliability, and reproducibility.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus both colonizes humans and causes severe virulent infections. Virulence is regulated by the agr quorum sensing system and its autoinducing peptide (AIP), with dynamics at the single-cell level across four agr-types - each defined by distinct AIP sequences and capable of cross-inhibition - remaining elusive. Employing microfluidics, time-lapse microscopy, and deep-learning image analysis, we uncovered significant differences in AIP sensitivity among agr-types. We observed bimodal agr activation, attributed to intergenerational phenotypic stability and influenced by AIP concentration. Upon AIP stimulation, agr-III showed AIP insensitivity, while agr-II exhibited increased sensitivity and prolonged generation time. Beyond expected cross-inhibition of agr-I by heterologous AIP-II and -III, the presumably cross-activating AIP-IV also inhibited agr-I. Community interactions across different agr-type pairings revealed four main patterns: stable or switched dominance, and delayed or stable dual activation, influenced by community characteristics. These insights underscore the potential of personalized treatment strategies considering virulence and genetic diversity.",

    "abstract": "Infection of grapevines by fungal pathogens causing grapevine trunk diseases (GTDs) primarily arises from annual pruning wounds made during the dormant season. While various studies have showcased the efficacy of products in shielding pruning wounds against GTDs infections, most of these investigations hinge on artificial pathogen inoculations, which may not faithfully mirror real field conditions. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the efficacy of various liquid formulation fungicides (pyraclostrobin + boscalid) and paste treatments, as well as biological control agents (BCA: Trichoderma atroviride SC1, T. atroviride I-1237, and T. asperellum ICC012 + T. gamsii ICC080), for their potential to prevent natural infection of grapevine pruning wounds by trunk disease fungi in two field trials located in Samaniego (Northern Spain) and Madiran (Southern France) over three growing seasons. Wound treatments were applied immediately after pruning in February. One year after pruning, canes were harvested from vines and brought to the laboratory for assessment of Trichoderma spp. and fungal trunk pathogens. More than 1,200 fungal isolates associated with five GTDs (esca, Botryophaeria, Diaporthe and Eutypa diebacks, and Cytospora canker) were collected from the two vineyards each growing season. Our findings reveal that none of the products under investigation exhibited complete effectiveness against all the GTDs. The efficacy of these products was particularly influenced by the specific year of study. A notable exception was observed with the biocontrol agent T. atroviride I-1237, which consistently demonstrated effectiveness against Botryosphaeria dieback infections throughout each year of the study, irrespective of the location. The remaining products exhibited efficacy in specific years or locations against particular diseases, with the physical barrier (paste) showing the least overall effectiveness. The recovery rates of Trichoderma spp. in treated plants were highly variable, ranging from 17% to 100%, with both strains of T. atroviride yielding the highest isolation rates. This study underscores the importance of customizing treatments for specific diseases, taking into account the influence of environmental factors for BCA applications.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing arms race between bacteria and phages has forced bacteria to evolve a sophisticated set of antiphage defense mechanisms that constitute the bacterial immune system. In our previous study, we highlighted the antiphage properties of aminoglycoside antibiotics, which are naturally secreted by Streptomyces. Successful inhibition of phage infection was achieved by addition of pure compounds and supernatants from a natural producer strain highlighting the potential for community-wide antiphage defense. However, given the dual functionality of these compounds, neighboring bacterial cells require resistance to the antibacterial activity of aminoglycosides to benefit from the protection they confer against phages. In this study, we demonstrated the successful uncoupling of antiphage and antibacterial properties via different aminoglycoside-resistance mechanisms encompassing drug and target site modifications. Furthermore, we confirmed the antiphage impact of aminoglycosides in a community context by co-culturing phage-susceptible, apramycin-resistant S. venezuelae with the apramycin-producing strain Streptoalloteichus tenebrarius. Given the prevalence of aminoglycoside resistance among natural bacterial isolates that allow functional uncoupling of these compounds, this study highlights the ecological relevance of chemical defense via aminoglycosides at the community level.",

However, doing this in models such as germfree mouse is expensive and time consuming. To address this problem, we developed a Caenorhabditis elegans based screening system. We used a gut microbiota culture collection that represents more than 70% functional capacity of the human gut microbiome to anaerobically colonize C. elegans. We chose colonization resistance as the phenotype of the microbiome for further screening and found that half of the strains, previously identified in vitro as inhibiting Clostridioides difficile, also did so in C. elegans. When validated using germ-free mouse model, results were in concordance with that obtained from C. elegans model. Our system therefore could be used for screening large number of bacterial species to better understand host-microbiome interaction.",

    "abstract": "Hematophagous Stomoxys (stable) fly populations in dairy barns are sustained by a constant availability of cattle hosts and manure, which serve as major reservoirs of both zoonotic and opportunistic bacterial pathogens. However, the overall composition and diversity of bacterial communities associated with Stomoxys flies and the ability of biting flies to acquire and transmit potentially pathogenic bacteria present in their surrounding environment remain to be investigated. Here, we present the first culture-independent examination of Stomoxys-associated bacterial communities through longitudinal sampling of fly and manure samples collected from two connected dairy facilities in South Central Wisconsin. High throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was used to characterize and compare bacterial communities present on or within flies and in manure collected from the same facility. Bacterial alpha diversity was overall higher in manure samples as compared to fly samples, with manure-associated bacterial communities being dominated by members of the Bacteroidales, Eubacteriales, and Oscillospirales. In contrast, flies harbored relatively low-complexity communities dominated by members of the Enterobacterales, Staphylococcales, and Lactobacillales. Clinically relevant bacterial strains, including Escherichia spp. and other taxa associated with mastitic cows housed in the same facilities, were detected in paired fly and manure samples but exhibited dramatically elevated abundances in fly samples as compared to manure samples. Viable colonies of Escherichia, Klebsiella, and Staphylococcus spp. were also readily isolated from fly samples, confirming that flies harbor culturable mastitis associated bacteria. This study provides definitive support for a potential role for biting flies in mediating bacterial pathogen transmission in dairy barns and other agricultural settings.\n\nIMPORTANCEDisease prevention on dairy farms has significant implications for cattle health, food security, and zoonosis. Of particular importance is the control of bovine mastitis, which can be caused by a diverse array of environmental bacterial pathogens, including Klebsiella, E. coli, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus spp. Despite being one of the most significant and costly cattle diseases worldwide, the epidemiology of bovine mastitis is not well understood. This study provides the first culture-dependent and culture-independent evidence to support the potential for biting flies to transmit opportunistic bovine and human pathogens in agricultural settings. It also links carriage of specific bacterial taxa in flies to clinical mastitis cases in cows housed in the same facility at the time of sampling. Altogether, these results indicate that biting flies represent an important, yet understudied biosecurity threat to animal husbandry facilities.",

    "abstract": "Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is a B-lymphotropic oncogenic retrovirus of the genus Deltaretrovirus that infects dairy cattle worldwide and is the causative agent of enzootic bovine leukosis. BLV demonstrates remarkably low efficiency in infecting cells via free viral particles derived from infected B cells, as virions are rarely detected in the bloodstream of infected cattle. However, transmission efficacy significantly increases upon the establishment of direct cell-to-cell interactions. Syncytium formation assays are the main tool in the study of BLV infectivity. Although this traditional method is highly robust, the complexity of visually counting syncytia poses a significant technical challenge. Using lentiviral vectors, we generated a stable reporter cell line, in which the GFP reporter gene is under the control of the full-length BLV-LTR. We have demonstrated that the BLV-Tax protein and histone deacetylases inhibitors, such as VPA and TSA, can transactivate the BLV LTR. Upon co-culturing the reporter cell line with BLV-infected cells, fluorescent syncytia can be visualized. By implementing automated scanning and image acquisition using a confocal microscope, together with the development of an analysis software, we can detect and measure single GFP cells and fluorescent multinucleated cells. In summary, our reporter cell line, combined with the development of analysis software, is a useful tool for understanding the role of cell fusion and cell-free mechanism of transmission in BLV infection.",

Here we show that SMARCAL1 displays a profound synthetic lethal interaction with FANCM, another ATP-dependent translocase involved in DNA replication and genome stability.

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are essential regulators of several biological processes. They are loaded onto Argonaute (AGO) proteins to achieve their repressive function, forming the microRNA-Induced Silencing Complex (miRISC). While several AGO proteins are expressed in plants and animals, it is still unclear why specific AGOs are strictly binding miRNAs. Here, we identified the co-chaperone DNJ-12 as a new interactor of ALG-1, one of the two major miRNA-specific AGOs in Caenorhabditis elegans. DNJ-12 does not interact with ALG-2, the other major miRNA-specific AGO, and PRG-1 and RDE-1, two AGOs involved in other small RNA pathways, making it a specific actor in ALG-1-dependent miRNA-mediated gene silencing. The loss of DNJ-12 causes developmental defects associated with defective miRNA function. Using the Auxin Inducible Degron (AID) system, a powerful tool to acutely degrade proteins in specific tissues, we show that DNJ-12 depletion hampers ALG-1 interaction with HSP70, a chaperone required for miRISC loading in vitro. Moreover, DNJ-12 depletion leads to the decrease of several miRNAs and prevents their loading onto ALG-1. This study uncovers the importance of a co-chaperone for the miRNA function in vivo and provides insights to explain how different small RNAs associate with specific AGO in animals.",

Enriched biological pathways discovered include those related to nitric oxide synthase, amphetamine addiction, and numerous calcium ion pathways, all of which are associated with addiction. Moreover, through the analysis of differentially expressed proteins, we speculated about some proteins not yet fully studied, which might play a significant role in the mechanisms of addiction: Protein kinase C and casein kinase substrate in neurons protein, Cysteine-rich motor neuron 1 protein, Bone morphogenetic protein receptor type-2, Immunoglobulin superfamily member 8.

    "abstract": "The salivary gland (SG) is an essential organ that secretes saliva, which supports versatile oral function throughout life, and is maintained by elusive epithelial stem and progenitor cells (SGSPC). Unfortunately, aging, drugs, autoimmune disorders, and cancer treatments can lead to salivary dysfunction and associated health consequences. Despite many ongoing therapeutic efforts to mediate those conditions, investigating human SGSPC is challenging due to lack of standardized tissue collection, limited tissue access, and inadequate purification methods. Herein, we established a diverse and clinically annotated salivary regenerative biobanking at the Mayo Clinic, optimizing viable salivary cell isolation and clonal assays in both 2D and 3D-matrigel growth environments. Our analysis identified ductal epithelial cells in vitro enriched with SGSPC expressing the CD24/EpCAM/CD49f+ and PSMA-phenotype. We identified PSMA expression as a reliable SGSPC differentiation marker. Moreover, we identified progenitor cell types with shared phenotypes exhibiting three distinct clonal patterns of salivary differentiation in a 2D environment. Leveraging innovative label-free unbiased LC-MS/MS-based single-cell proteomics, we identified 819 proteins across 71 single cell proteome datasets from purified progenitor-enriched parotid gland (PG) and sub-mandibular gland (SMG) cultures. We identified distinctive co-expression of proteins, such as KRT1/5/13/14/15/17/23/76 and 79, exclusively observed in rare, scattered salivary ductal basal cells, indicating the potential de novo source of SGSPC. We also identified an entire class of peroxiredoxin peroxidases, enriched in PG than SMG, and attendant H2O2-dependent cell proliferation in vitro suggesting a potential role for PRDX-dependent floodgate oxidative signaling in salivary homeostasis. The distinctive clinical resources and research insights presented here offer a foundation for exploring personalized regenerative medicine.",

    "abstract": "The NF-{kappa}B signaling pathway is a key regulatory network in mammals that controls many cellular processes, including immunity and inflammation. Of particular note is the relationship between NF-{kappa}B and its inhibitor I{kappa}B, which sequesters NF-{kappa}B to the cytoplasm of cells until needed. It is also known that I{kappa}B can enter nuclei, disrupt NF-{kappa}B binding to DNA, and shuttle it out to again sequester NF-{kappa}B in the cytoplasm. In Drosophila melanogaster, a homologous system between the proteins Dorsal (homologous to NF-{kappa}B) and Cactus (homologous to I{kappa}B) is important in embryo development, specifically in establishment of the Dorsal nuclear concentration gradient. Previous work suggests Cactus also enters the nucleus; mathematical models of the Dorsal gradient fail to accurately predict the normal range of the gradient without nuclear Cactus. However, direct, in vivo visualization of Cactus spatiotemporal dynamics, including its localization to the nuclei, has been difficult to gather. Previously, imaging Cactus in live embryos was complicated by rapid protein turnover, preventing fluorescent protein fusions from fully maturing. To address this, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to tag Cactus with the recently developed \"LlamaTag\" (LT), a genetically encodable nanobody from llamas that dynamically binds to GFP in vivo. We then employed standard confocal imaging, as well as advanced optical techniques such as raster image correlation spectroscopy (RICS) and fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of Cactus-LlamaTag in Drosophila embryos at the blastoderm stage. Our results demonstrate that Cactus can be found in the nuclei of early embryos, consistent with its role as a transcription factor regulator. Moreover, by using the data from FRAP and RICS, we were able to estimate biophysical parameters of Cactus dynamics in vivo, including its nuclear transport rate constants and fraction bound to GFP. These data were further used to constrain a mathematical model that allowed us to infer experimentally inaccessible biophysical parameters, such as the concentration of Cact protein and the dissociation constant of LT and GFP. Our study provides new insights into the regulation of the NF-{kappa}B pathway in early Drosophila embryos and highlights the power of advanced optical techniques for investigating complex biological dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Certain environmental factors can impact fertility and reproductive parameters such as the number and quality of sperm and eggs. One possible mechanism is the perturbation of epigenetic landscapes in the germline. To explore this possibility, we conducted a CRISPRi screen of epigenetic-related genes to identify those that specifically perturb the differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs), exploiting a highly scalable cytokine-free platform. Of the 701 genes screened, inhibition of 53 decreased the efficiency of PGCLC formation. NCOR2, a transcriptional repressor that acts via recruitment of Class I and Class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs) to gene targets, was particularly potent in suppressing PGCLC differentiation. Consistent with evidence that histone deacetylation is crucial for germline differentiation, we found that the HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) valproic acid (VPA; an anti-convulsant) and sodium butyrate (SB; a widely-used dietary supplement) also suppressed ESC>PGCLC differentiation. Furthermore, exposure of developing mouse embryos to SB or VPA caused hypospermatogenesis. Transcriptome analyses of HDACi-treated, differentiating ESC>PGCLC cultures revealed suppression of germline-associated pathways and enhancement of somatic pathways. This work demonstrates the feasibility of conducting large-scale functional screens of genes, chemicals, or other agents that may impact germline development.",

Leveraging imputed genome-wide SNP data, we characterise thousands of cis- and trans-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and show that the PB transcriptome is substantially impacted by intrapopulation genomic variation. We integrate our gene expression data with summary statistics from multiple GWAS data sets for bTB susceptibility and perform the first transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) in the context of tuberculosis disease. From this TWAS, we identify 136 functionally relevant genes (including RGS10, GBP4, TREML2, and RELT) and provide important new omics data for understanding the host response to mycobacterial infections that cause tuberculosis in mammals.",

    "abstract": "Reconstruction of complete bacterial genomes is a vital aspect of microbial research, as it provides complex information about genetic content, gene ontology, and regulation. It has become a domain of 3rd generation, long-read sequencing platforms, as short-read technologies can deliver mainly fragmented genomes. PacBio platform can provide high-quality complete genomes, yet remains one of the most expensive sequencing strategies. Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) offers the advantage of producing the longest reads, being at the same time the most cost-effective option in terms of platform costs, as well as library preparation, and sequencing. However, ONTs error rate, although significantly reduced lately, still holds a certain level of distrust in the scientific community.\n\nIn recent years, hybrid assembly of Nanopore and Illumina data has been used to solve ONTs issue with error rate and has yielded the best results in terms of genome completeness, quality, and price. However, the latest advancements in Nanopore technology, including new flow cells (R10.4.1), new library preparation chemistry (V14) and duplex-mode, updated basecallers (Dorado v0.4.1), and the realization that sequencing in dark mode results in significantly increased throughput, have had a significant impact on the quality of generated data and, thus, the recovery of complete genomes by ONT sequencing alone.\n\nIn this study, we compared the data generated by ONT using three sequencing strategies (Native barcoding, RAPID barcoding, and custom-developed: BARSEQ) against PacBio and Illumina (NextSeq) as well as Illumina-ONT hybrid data. For this purpose, we employed three strains of the actinobacteria Propionibacterium freudenreichii, whose genomes have been proven difficult to reconstruct due to high GC content, regions of repeated sequences and massive genome rearrangements.\n\nOur data indicate that DNA libraries prepared with the native barcoding kit, sequenced with V14 chemistry on R10.4.1 flow cell, and assembled with Flye resulted in the reconstruction of complete genomes of overall quality highly similar to that of genomes reconstructed with PacBio. The highest level of quality can be achieved by hybrid assembly of data from the Native barcoding kit complemented with data from custom-developed BARSEQ, both sequenced on R10.4.1 flow cell. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that ONT can be used as a cost-effective sequencing strategy, without the need for complementing with other sequencing technologies, for the reconstruction of complete genomes of the highest quality.",

Rearrangement hotspot (Rhs) proteins represent one of the most common T6SS-secreted effectors. The C-terminal toxin domain of Rhs proteins displays great functional diversity, while the large Rhs core is characterised by YD repeats. T6SS- associated Rhs proteins are attached to the VgrG spike protein, often via an N- terminal PAAR-repeat domain. Using X-ray crystallography, we here elucidate the Rhs core structures of PAAR- and VgrG-linked Rhs proteins from Salmonella bongori and Advenella mimigardefordensis, respectively. The Rhs core forms a large container made up of {beta}-sheets that has a negatively charged interior and encloses a large volume. The presence of the toxin domain of S. bongori PAAR-linked Rhs does not lead to ordered density in the Rhs container, suggesting the toxin domain is at least partially unfolded. Together with bioinformatics analysis showing that Rhs toxins predominantly act intracellularly, this suggests that the Rhs core domain functions two-fold, as safety feature for the producer cell and as delivery mechanism for the toxin domain. Our results strengthen our knowledge of Rhs structure and function.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a well-established non-invasive technique used to investigate brain function in health and disease. However, conventional methods of coil placement have limitations in accurately estimating the effects of TMS. Numerical modeling has shown promise in optimizing coil placement by providing a means to quantify the relationship between coil placement and region-specific electric field (E-field) effects. In this context, we propose the Stimulation Effects Mapping (SEM) framework to address this issue. The SEM framework aims to quantify It has been validated using diverse samples and neuroimaging data, allowing for standardized individual coil placements and optimal group-level positions. Through the analysis of a large dataset consisting of 5 million E-field modeling results from 212 participants, SEM consistently quantified the relationship between coil placement and region-specific E-field effects. In comparison to conventional methods and recent techniques, SEM-based optimal coil placement offers the same convenience while providing an improved understanding of depression treatment efficacy. By accurately quantifying the relationship between coil placement and E-field effects, SEM enables the identification of optimal coil positions that target specific cortical regions. This advancement in coil placement standardization overcomes limitations and promotes the precise modulation of brain activity based on E-field stimulation effects. The open-source nature of the SEM framework facilitates its adoption and encourages the precise modulation of brain activity through E-field stimulation. By leveraging the SEM framework, transcranial neuromodulation can be advanced, leading to improved outcomes in various applications.",

    "abstract": "Glioma is a type of tumor that begins in glial cells and occurs in the brain and spinal cord. Glioma forms a major health challenge worldwide. They are hard to treat, not only because of the deregulation in multiple signaling transduction pathways affecting various cellular processes but also because they are not contained in a well-defined mass with clear borders. One of the main pathways deregulated in glioma is PI3K-AKT and its associated downstream targets like NF-B which affects different proteins/transcription factors influencing many aspects of gliomagenesis like epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). A combination of in-silico and in-vitro approaches targeted against specific catalytic isoform (p110{delta}) of Class IA PI3K with potent and selective inhibitors would maximize the chances of tumor regression. We adopted an in-silico approach to screen a range of natural molecules for a potent p110{delta} inhibitor and among them, \"emodin\" was found to be a potential candidate. In vitro, emodin treatment inhibits proliferation, induces apoptosis, modulates astrocytic phenotype, and decreases cell density of glioma cells. Emodin induces changes in the astrocytic phenotype of glioma cells to elongated form with rounded-off, shrunken-down morphology. Emodin was found to contribute to ROS production which leads to apoptosis of glioma cells. The apoptosis induced by emodin was confirmed by propidium iodide staining and ascertained by FACS analysis. We evaluated the effect of emodin on various proteins of PI3K-AKT and downstream targets. We found that emodin treatment decreases the expression of p-AKT, increases expression levels of I-B, inhibits nuclear translocation of NF-B, and upregulates the phosphorylated form of GSK-3{beta}. Changes at the molecular level of these proteins result in the inhibition/degradation of downstream proteins and transcription factors associated with the growth and proliferation of glioma cells. Inhibition of nuclear translocation of NF-B also inhibits nuclear activation of various protumorigenic signaling pathway mediators involved in EMT such as N-cadherin, {beta}-catenin, Claudin-1. These EMT markers promote invasion, proliferation, migration, and growth in glioma cells. Emodin treatment resulted in changed expression profiles of these EMT markers involved in promoting gliomagenesis. In essence these results suggest that in-vitro emodin treatment remarkably reduces the proliferation of glioma cells possibly targeting multiple pathways involved in tumor growth, proliferation, and development, supporting the rationale and relevance of using multipronged strategies for effective treatment of glioma.",

It has been assumed that these KVS must obligatorily assemble with subunits from the KV2 family into heterotetrameric channels, thereby giving raise to currents distinct from those of homomeric KV2 channels.\n\nHerein, we show that KVS subunits indeed also modulate the activity, biophysical properties and surface expression of recombinant KV7 isoforms in a subunit-specific manner. Employing co-immunoprecipitation, and proximity labelling, we unveil the spatial coexistence of KVS and KV7 within a single protein complex. Electrophysiological experiments further indicate functional interaction and probably heterotetramer formation. Finally, single-cell transcriptomic analyses identify native cell types in which this KVS and KV7 interaction may occur.

    "abstract": "Approximately 15% of the global human population is viremic with human pegivirus (HPgV), a +ssRNA virus in the Flaviviridae family. An unusual feature of HPgV is its ability to persistently infect individuals without causing overt disease or evoking robust immune responses, but this phenomenon is poorly understood due to a dearth of systems for studying HPgV. In this study, we create the first mouse model of PgV infection by adapting a PgV discovered in a wild rat (RPgV) to infect the standard laboratory mouse. Adaptation to the mouse initially required defective innate immunity and the accumulation of a single mutation in the E2 envelope glycoprotein, but passage into wild-type (WT) mice resulted in twelve additional mutations that enable persistent high-titer viremia, closely recapitulating the course of HPgV in humans. Mouse-adapted (ma)PgV infection of various knockout mice showed that lymphocytes exert a significant antiviral effect in the chronic phase of infection, but that this effect is also unable to fully control viremia in most individuals. Chronic type-I interferon signaling appears to paradoxically enable maPgV persistence, likely via T cell dysfunction that has been demonstrated in other chronic viral infections. However, unlike many persistent viruses, maPgV does not depend upon the induction of PD-1-mediated immune tolerance to maintain persistence. In-depth analysis of rare WT mice that achieved sterilizing maPgV immunity suggests that multiple possible paths to achieving PgV immunity exist and may include a combination of cellular, humoral, and non-canonical mechanisms. Altogether, our creation of maPgV opens up the vast murine toolkit for understanding the enigmatic biology of PgVs. In addition to novel insights into multiple aspects of PgV immunity, the lack of PD-1-mediated immune tolerance induced by PgV infection is unique among persistent viruses and suggests a highly novel mechanism of immune evasion.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYViruses capable of persistently infecting an individual host have developed sophisticated mechanisms for evading host immunity, and understanding these mechanisms can reveal novel features of the host immune system. One such virus, human pegivirus (HPgV), infects [~]15% of the global human population, but little is known about its biology beyond the fact that it does not cause overt disease. We created the first mouse model of PgV infection by adapting a rat pegivirus to infect laboratory mice. This mouse-adapted virus (maPgV) caused infection that was detectable in the blood of mice for >300 days without causing signs of disease, closely recapitulating the course of HPgV in humans. This enabled unprecedented exploration of PgV immunity, revealing a pro-viral role for type-I interferon in chronic infection; a lack of PD-1-mediated tolerance to PgV infection; and multiple mechanisms by which PgV immunity can be achieved by an immunocompetent host. These data indicate that the PgV immune evasion strategy has aspects that are both common and unique among persistent viral infections. The creation of maPgV represents the first PgV infection model in wild-type mice, thus opening the entire toolkit of the mouse host to enable further investigation of persistent RNA infections.",
