    "abstract": "Structural insight eludes on how full-length gelsolin depolymerizes and caps F-actin, while the same entity can nucleate polymerization of G-actins. Employing small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data analysis, we deciphered these two contrasting assemblies. Mixing Ca2+-gelsolin with F-actin in high salt F-buffer resulted in depolymerization of ordered F-actin rods to smaller sized species which became monodisperse upon dialysis with low salt G-buffer. These entities were the ternary (GA2) and binary (GA) complexes of gelsolin and actin with radius of gyration and maximum linear dimension of 4.55 and 4.68 nm, and 15 and 16 nm, respectively. In contrast, upon mixing G-actin with Ca2+-gelsolin in G-buffer, rapid association of higher order species started. Using size exclusion chromatography in-line with SAXS, we confirmed that initially GA and GA2 species are formed as seen upon depolymerization of F-actin, followed by dialysis. Interestingly, while GA2 could seed formation of native-like F-actin in both G- and F-buffer, GA failed in G-buffer. Thus, GA2 and GA are the central species formed via depolymerization or towards nucleation. SAXS profile referenced modeling revealed that: 1) in GA, actin is bound to the C-terminal half of gelsolin, and 2) in GA2, second actin binds to the open N-terminal half accompanied by dramatic rearrangements across g1-g2 and g3-g4 linkers. Importantly, first structural insight is provided into the two probable models for GA2 with two actins in parallel, but differentially stacked: one in polymerization competent, and other in incompetent manner, suggesting latter to represent capped state along with the inert GA.",

    "abstract": "Lupin crops provide nutritious seeds as an excellent source of dietary protein. However, extensive genomic resources are needed for the adaptation of lupin crops, particularly to improve their nutritional value and facilitate their adaptation to harsh environments caused by the changing climate. Such resources can be derived from crop wild relatives, which represent a large untapped source of genetic variation for crop improvement. Here we describe the first whole-genome sequences of the cross-compatible species Lupinus cosentinii (Mediterranean) and its pan-Saharan wild relative L. digitatus, which are well adapted to drought-prone environments and partially domesticated. We found that both species are tetraploids, with similar genome structures, distributions of gene duplications, and numbers of expanded and contracted gene families. The expansion and contraction of gene families that determine seed size, a paradigmatic domestication trait, indicates that gene duplication may have led to morphological adaptations in Lupinus cosentinii and L. digitatus differing from those in L. albus, a domesticated lupin used as a reference. Seed size may therefore reflect convergent evolution mechanisms that play a key role in lupin domestication.",

However, DiDBiT has currently only been used to compare two conditions per experiment. Here, we present DiDBiT-TMT, a method that can be used to quantify NSPs across many conditions and replicates in the same experiment by combining isobaric tandem mass tagging (TMT) with DiDBiT. We applied DiDBiT-TMT to brain slices to determine changes in the de-novo proteome that occur after inducing chemical long-term potentiation (cLTP) or treatment with the neuromodulator norepinephrine. We successfully demonstrated DiDBiT-TMT's capacity to quantitatively compare up to 9 samples in parallel. We showed a 98.7% overlap between the NSPs differentially expressed in cLTP-treated and Norepinephrine-treated organotypic brain slices , which has not been previously observed with conventional proteomic methods.",

    "abstract": "The serotonin 1A receptor has been linked to both the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) and the antidepressant action of serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Most PET studies of the serotonin 1A receptor in MDD used the receptor antagonist radioligand, carbonyl-11CWAY100635 however the interpretation of the combined results has been contentious owing to reports of higher or lower binding in MDD with different outcome measures. The reasons for these divergent results originate from several sources, including properties of the radiotracer itself, which complicate its quantification and interpretation; as well as from previously reported differences between MDD and healthy volunteers in both reference tissue binding and plasma free fraction, which are typically assumed not to differ. Recently, we have developed two novel hierarchical multivariate methods which we validated for the quantification and analysis of 11CWAY100635, which show better accuracy and inferential efficiency compared to standard analysis approaches. Importantly, these new methods should theoretically be more resilient to many of the factors thought to have caused the discrepancies observed in previous studies. We sought to apply these methods in the largest 11CWAY100635 sample to date, consisting of 160 individuals, including 103 MDD patients, of whom 50 were not-recently-medicated and 53 were antidepressant-exposed, as well as 57 healthy volunteers. While the outcome measure discrepancies were substantial using conventional univariate analysis, our multivariate analysis techniques instead yielded highly consistent results across PET outcome measures and across pharmacokinetic models, with all approaches showing higher serotonin 1A autoreceptor binding potential in the raphe nuclei of not-recently-medicated MDD patients relative to both healthy volunteers and antidepressant-exposed MDD patients. Moreover, with the additional precision of estimates afforded by this approach, we can show that while binding is also higher in projection areas in this group, these group differences are approximately half of those in the raphe nuclei, which are statistically distinguishable from one another. These results are consistent with the biological role of the serotonin 1A autoreceptor in the raphe nuclei in regulating serotonin neuron firing and release, and with preclinical and clinical evidence of deficient serotonin activity in MDD due to over expression of autoreceptors resulting from genetic and/or epigenetic effects. These results are also consistent with downregulation of autoreceptors as a mechanism of action of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. In summary, the results using multivariate analysis approaches therefore demonstrate both face and convergent validity, and may serve to provide a resolution and consensus interpretation for the disparate results of previous studies examining the serotonin 1A receptor in MDD.",

    "abstract": "Why do people have different opinions regarding who the best musical artist is? While neuroscience of creativity consensually defines creativity as producing something both original and adequate, how this is influenced by individual preferences remains unclear. Combining creative word-association and rating tasks, this study demonstrates that individuals assign subjective values to ideas, balancing originality and adequacy according to individual preferences and impacting their creative abilities. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging shows that subjective valuation is supported by the Brain Valuation System and that originality and adequacy are monitored via the Default Mode and the Executive Control Networks, respectively. Interestingly, the relative functional connectivity of the Default Mode and Executive Control Networks with the Brain Valuation System correlates with the relative balance of adequacy and originality in individuals' preferences. These results bridge a gap in the current literature by adding valuation to the incomplete behavioral and neural accounts of creativity, and offer perspectives on the influence of individual preferences on creative abilities.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning has made several inroads into the study of brain-behavior relations based on in vivo imaging. While the advent of deep neural networks was expected to further improve predictions, the current literature based on resting-state functional connectivity presents mixed results. We hypothesize that the representation of the data, i.e. in the form of functional connectivity, could restrict an advantage of deep learning techniques, namely that of learning complex representations directly from the data. Thus, we investigated if bypassing this feature extraction resulted in improved performance in the prediction of 58 widely studied behavioral traits from a large sample of Human Connectome Project subjects, using deep learning techniques. For this task, we adapted the InceptionTime architecture, which jointly predicts traits directly from regional time series through representation learning, and compared results with a strong kernel-based baseline. Results revealed that both models achieve comparable performance in most traits. Eleven significant differences in mean squared error were detected, however, with seven favoring the neural network approach, and this number increased when accounting for covariates. We additionally show that contrary to the expectation, the neural network approach was more robust to reductions in the training set size. On the other hand, it was more sensitive to reductions in the length of the time series at test time. Our results present a more nuanced view of the potential of deep learning for the prediction of behavior from neuroimaging, which allows learning features directly from the data.",

    "abstract": "Millions of people suffer worldwide from neurodegenerative diseases ranging from rapidly progressing and fatal motor neuron diseases like Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) to more chronic illnesses such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimers disease (AD). A growing number of studies have implicated neuroinflammation as a key and causative phenomenon and an important target for novel therapeutics for these diseases. Neuroinflammation is characterized by reactive glial cells that produce pro-inflammatory neurotoxic cytokines. Our previous studies have shown a brain-penetrant Nanoligomer cocktail (NI112) inhibiting the neuroinflammation mediators nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-{kappa}B) and NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) is a safe, targeted, and effective neurotherapeutic drug. Here, we show that a four-week NI112 treatment is therapeutic using: 1) an ALS-FTD 3D human motor neuron organoid model of tar DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43, a key contributor to ALS pathology) overexpression (knock-in); 2) an AD model of APOE4/APOE4 (AD risk allele) double mutation in human neurons comprising a 3D human prefrontal cortex (PFC) organoid; and 3) multiple in vivo (mouse models) of the same/related conditions. In 3D organoids made from healthy motor neurons (HMN negative control) and TDP-43 overexpressing (or ALS organoids), we monitored the mean firing rate using calcium signaling as a functional output, while measuring TDP-43 and other key neurodegeneration biomarkers. After 4 weeks, we observed a massive improvement in the mean firing rate of NI112-treated ALS organoids compared to untreated ALS organoids, which was more comparable to healthy HMN organoids. Similarly, we found a significant decrease in neurodegeneration markers like amyloid beta 42 (A{beta}42) in NI112-treated AD organoids compared to untreated AD organoids (A{beta}42 comparable to healthy PFC organoids). In the mouse ALS (SOD1-G93A) model, we observed behavioral improvements and restoration of motor function (e.g., grip strength) in NI112-treated mice, and in mouse AD model mice (radiation-induced accelerated neuropathology in APP/PS1, and rTg4510 phospho-tau), we observed improved cognition. In both models, we also found an accompanying reduction in neuroinflammation and reduced neuropathology. These results show the promise for further testing and development of neuroinflammation-targeting Nanoligomers to benefit patients suffering from debilitating neurodegenerative diseases like ALS, FTD, and AD.",

Homologous heteroheptameric IRMs have been structurally characterized in ion pumps such as Tol/Ton/Exb/Gld, and most recently in phage defense systems such as Zor. Functional stator complexes synthesized from chimeras of PomB/MotB (PotB) have been used to slow flagellar rotation via reduced external sodium concentration. Such chimeras are highly sensitive to the location of the cut-site and thus far have been arbitrarily designed. To date, no chimeras have been constructed using interchange of components from Tol/Ton/Exb/Gld and other ion powered motors with more distant homology. Here we synthesised chimeras of MotAB, PomAPotB and ExbBD to assess their capacity for cross-compatibility. We obtained motile B-unit chimeric stator complexes whose motility was further optimised by directed evolution. Whole genome sequencing of these revealed epistatic adaptations in the A-subunit and at the peptidoglycan binding domain of the B-unit could improve motility. Overall, our work highlights the role of allostery and the challenges associated with rational design of chimeric IRMs.",

    "abstract": "The lateral line system enables all fishes and aquatic-stage amphibians to detect local water movement via mechanosensory hair cells in neuromasts, and many species to detect weak electric fields via electroreceptors (modified hair cells) in ampullary organs. Both neuromasts and ampullary organs develop from lateral line placodes. However, the molecular mechanisms underpinning ampullary organ formation are understudied relative to neuromasts, as electroreception was lost in the ancestors of zebrafish (teleosts) and Xenopus (frogs). We identified Bmp5 as a promising candidate via differential RNA-seq in an electroreceptive ray-finned fish, the Mississippi paddlefish (Polyodon spathula; Modrell et al., 2017, eLife 6: e24197). In an experimentally tractable relative, the sterlet sturgeon (Acipenser ruthenus), we found that Bmp5 and four other Bmp pathway genes are expressed in the developing lateral line, and that Bmp signalling is active. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis targeting Bmp5 in F0-injected sterlet embryos resulted in fewer ampullary organs. Conversely, when Bmp signalling was inhibited by DMH1 treatment shortly before the formation of ampullary organ primordia, supernumerary ampullary organs developed. These data suggest that Bmp5 promotes ampullary organ development, whereas Bmp signalling via another ligand(s) prevents their overproduction. Taken together, this demonstrates two opposing roles for Bmp signalling during ampullary organ formation.",

The predominant cyanobacterial order identified was Nodosilineales, with the genus Rhodoploca having highest relative abundance. Our results suggest that cyanobacterial communities became more diverse as sea turtles age as we had found a positive correlation between community diversity and the length of a sea turtle's carapace. Since larger and older turtles predominantly utilize neritic habitats, the shift to more diverse cyanobacterial community aligned with a shift in loggerheads habitat. Our research provided detailed insights into the cyanobacterial communities associated with loggerhead sea turtles, establishing a foundation for future studies delving into this fascinating ecological relationship and its potential implications for sea turtle conservation.",

    "abstract": "Having a profound influence on marine and coastal environments worldwide, jellyfish hold significant scientific, economic, and public interest. The predictability of outbreaks and dispersion of jellyfish is limited by a fundamental gap in our understanding of their movement. Although there is evidence that jellyfish may actively affect their position, the role of active swimming in controlling jellyfish movement, and the characteristics of jellyfish swimming behavior, are not well understood. Consequently, jellyfish are often regarded as passively drifting or randomly moving organisms, both conceptually and in process studies. Here we show that the movement of jellyfish is controlled by distinctly directional swimming patterns, which are oriented against the direction of surface gravity waves. Taking a Lagrangian viewpoint from drone videos that allows the tracking of multiple adjacent jellyfish, and focusing the scyphozoan jellyfish Rhopilema nomadica as a model organism, we show that the behavior of individual jellyfish translates into a synchronized directional swimming of the aggregation as a whole. Numerical simulations show that this counter wave swimming behavior results in biased correlated random-walk movement patterns that reduce the risk of stranding, thus providing jellyfish with an adaptive advantage critical to their survival. Our results emphasize the importance of active swimming in regulating jellyfish movement, and open the way for a more accurate representation in model studies, thus improving the predictability of jellyfish outbreaks and their dispersion, and contributing to our ability to mitigate their possible impact on coastal infrastructure and populations.",

    "abstract": "Background: Megaleporinus macrocephalus (piaucu) is a Neotropical fish within Characoidei that presents a well-established heteromorphic ZZ/ZW sex-determination system and thus, constitutes a good model for studying W and Z chromosomes in fishes. We used PacBio reads and Hi-C to assemble a chromosome-level reference genome for M. macrocephalus. We generated family segregation information to construct a genetic map, pool-seq of males and females to characterize its sex system, and RNA-seq to highlight candidate genes of M. macrocephalus sex determination. Results: M. macrocephalus reference genome is 1,282,030,339 bp in length and has a contig and scaffold N50 of 5.0 Mb and 45.03 Mb, respectively. Based on patterns of recombination suppression, coverage, Fst, and sex-specific SNPs, three major regions were distinguished in the sex chromosome: W-specific (highly differentiated), Z-specific (in degeneration), and PAR. The sex chromosome gene repertoire was composed of genes from the TGF-beta family (amhr2, bmp7) and Wnt/beta-catenin pathway (wnt4, wnt7a), and some of them were differentially expressed. Conclusions: The chromosome-level genome of piaucu exhibits high quality, establishing a valuable resource for advancing research within the group. Our discoveries offer insights into the evolutionary dynamics of Z and W sex chromosomes in fish, emphasizing ongoing degenerative processes and indicating complex interactions between Z and W sequences in specific genomic regions. Notably, amhr2 and bmp7 are potential candidate genes for sex determination in M. macrocephalus.",

    "abstract": "Predicting bacterial transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) through computational methods is a core challenge in systems biology, and there is still a long way to go. Here we propose a powerful, general, and stable computational framework called PGBTR, which employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to predict bacterial transcriptional regulatory relationships from gene expression data and genomic information. PGBTR consists of two main components: the input generation step PDGD and the deep learning model CNNBTR. On the real Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis datasets, PGBTR outperforms other advanced supervised and unsupervised learning methods in terms of AUROC, AUPR, and F1-score. Moreover, PGBTR exhibits greater stability in identifying real transcriptional regulatory interactions compared to existing methods. PGBTR provides a new software tool for bacterial TRNs inference, and its core ideas can be further extended to other molecular network inference tasks and other biological problems using gene expression data.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell technologies offer a unique opportunity to explore cellular heterogeneity in hematopoiesis, reveal malignant hematopoietic cells with clinically significant features and measure gene signatures linked to pathological pathways. However, reliable identification of cell types is a crucial bottleneck in single-cell analysis. Available databases contain dissimilar nomenclature and non-concurrent marker sets, leading to inconsistent annotations and poor interpretability. Furthermore, current tools focus mostly on physiological cell types, lacking extensive applicability in disease. We developed the Cell Marker Accordion, a user-friendly platform for the automatic annotation and biological interpretation of single-cell populations based on consistency weighted markers. We validated our approach on peripheral blood and bone marrow single-cell datasets, using surface markers and expert-based annotation as the ground truth. In all cases, we significantly improved the accuracy in identifying cell types with respect to any single source database. Moreover, the Cell Marker Accordion can identify disease-critical cells and pathological processes, extracting potential biomarkers in a wide variety of contexts in human and murine single-cell datasets. It characterizes leukemia stem cell subtypes, including therapy-resistant cells in acute myeloid leukemia patients; it identifies malignant plasma cells in multiple myeloma samples; it dissects cell type alterations in splicing factor-mutant cells from myelodysplastic syndrome patients; it discovers activation of innate immunity pathways in bone marrow from mice treated with METTL3 inhibitors. The breadth of these applications elevates the Cell Marker Accordion as a flexible, faithful and standardized tool to annotate and interpret hematopoietic populations in single-cell datasets focused on the study of hematopoietic development and disease.",

    "abstract": "Reef-building corals depend on an intricate community of microorganisms for functioning and resilience. Bacteriophages are the most abundant and diverse members of these communities, yet very little is known about their functions in the holobiont due to methodological limitations that have prevented the recovery of high-quality viral genomes and bacterial host assignment from coral samples. Here, we introduce a size-fractionation approach which increased bacterial and viral recovery in coral metagenomes by 9-fold and 3-fold, respectively, and enabled the assembly and binning of bacterial and viral genomes at relatively low sequencing coverage. We combined these viral genomes with those derived from 677 publicly available metagenomes, viromes, and bacterial isolates from stony corals to build a Global Coral Virome Database of over 20,000 viral genomes and genome fragments spanning four viral realms. The tailed bacteriophage families Kyanoviridae and Ackermannviridae were the most abundant, replacing the since-abolished groups Podoviridae and Siphoviridae. Prophage and CRISPR spacer linkages between these viruses and 626 bacterial metagenome-assembled genomes and bacterial isolates showed that most viruses infected Alphaproteobacteria, the most abundant class, and less abundant taxa like Halanaerobiia and Bacteroidia. A host-phage-gene network identified keystone viruses with the genomic capacity to eavesdrop and modulate bacterial quorum sensing, interfere with sulfur cycling, and direct molecular interactions with eukaryotic cells through the release of extracellular effectors. This study reveals the basis of bacteriophage roles in modulating ecological interactions not only among bacterial community members but also directly affecting tripartite interactions with the coral host and its endosymbiotic algae.",

We apply ODFs to create physics-informed models of image formation with spatio-angular point-spread and transfer functions.

We use our system to extend known two-dimensional results to three dimensions in FM1-43-labelled giant unilamellar vesicles, fast-scarlet-labelled cellulose in xylem cells, and phalloidin-labelled actin in U2OS cells.

Unraveling and targeting the early events leading to therapy-induced DTP cell-enrichment presents a potential avenue for innovative therapeutic strategies. In this study, we identified the activation of the Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling pathway as a common mechanism underlying early DTP cell-enrichment in response to different chemotherapeutic agents in Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Live-imaging reveals de novo transcriptional Wnt-activation prevailing over intrinsic selection post chemotherapy. Importantly, Wnt-active (WntHigh) cells exhibit transcriptional and functional similarities to DTP cells, such as a diapause transcriptional signature, reduced proliferation, and marked chemoresistance. The transition to a post-treatment WntHigh state is driven by increased expression of key components involved in canonical Wnt ligand-secretion and -activation. Genetic interference or concomitant, rather than sequential, pharmacologic inhibition of Wnt ligand-secretion alongside chemotherapy prevents treatment-induced WntHigh enrichment, sensitizing TNBC tumors to chemotherapy. This study enhances our understanding of the introductory mechanisms driving DTP cell-enrichment upon chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression is orchestrated by transcription factors, which function within the context of a three-dimensional genome. Zinc finger protein 143 (ZNF143/ZFP143) is a transcription factor that has been implicated in both gene activation and chromatin looping. To study the direct consequences of ZNF143/ZFP143 loss, we generated a ZNF143/ZFP143 degron line. Our results show that ZNF143/ZFP143 depletion has no effect on chromatin looping. Systematic analysis of ZNF143/ZFP143 occupancy data revealed that a commonly used antibody cross-reacts with CTCF, leading to its incorrect association with chromatin loops. Nevertheless, ZNF143/ZFP143 specifically activates nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes and its loss leads to severe mitochondrial dysfunction. Using an in vitro embryo model, we find that ZNF143/ZFP143 is an essential regulator of organismal development. Our results establish ZNF143/ZFP143 as a conserved transcriptional regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation by safeguarding mitochondrial activity.",

    "abstract": "The intracellular milieu presents a complex physicochemical environment where molecular redundancy prevails and infra-threshold perturbations are integrated by biochemical networks. The pathways that result from these interactions are complex and will result in a plethora of signalling cascades. The stoichiometry number matrix for a biochemical network is a suitable way to represent the interactions between various molecular species under baseline conditions and in response to stimuli. Here, we model a class of biochemical networks with a set of constrained, reaction-centric, stoichiometry equivalent and degenerate matrices. The matrices exhibit a many-to-one surjection with the null space and form a semigroup with respect to addition. The parameters for these studies are the probable dissociation constants and will be used to derive several network- and reaction-specific metrics. These will describe the class of modelled biochemical networks both, at the level of a single network and as a unit. The model is extendible and can be used to perturb a biochemical network by introducing a finite number of extraneous reactions and then comparing pairs of like-reactions. The theoretical assertions presented are complemented by detailed computational analyses of the hexose monophosphate shunt, urea cycle and folate metabolism in humans. The model provides a theoretically sound basis to interrogate the effects of molecular redundancy and perturbations in the genesis and regulation of complex biochemical function. The model is theoretically sound, mathematically rigorous, readily testable, biochemically relevant, easily parameterizable and can be used to compare biochemical networks under differing intracellular conditions, both, between cells and across taxa.",

In this study, we test the hypothesis that the Zbtb14 protein oscillates in the hippocampus in a circadian manner and that this oscillation is disrupted by epilepsy. We found that Zbtb14 immunostaining is present in the cytoplasm and cell nuclei. Western blot data indicate that the cytoplasmic and nuclear levels of Zbtb14 protein oscillate, but the phase is shifted. The densities of the Zbtb14-immunopositive express circadian dynamics in the ventral hilus and Ca3 but not in the dorsal hilus, Ca3, or the somatosensory cortex. In the pilocarpine model of epilepsy increase in the level of Zbtb14 protein was found at 11 PM, but not at 3 PM compared to controls. Finally, in silico analysis revealed the presence of the ZF5 motif in the promoters of 21 out of 24 genes down-regulated by epileptiform discharges in vitro, many of which are involved in neuronal plasticity. Our data suggest that Zbtb14 may be involved in the circadian dynamic of seizure regulation or brain response to seizure rhythmicity.",

Using fMRI and pupillometry, we investigated whether this discrepancy stems from reduced spontaneous mentalizing or broader difficulties in unstructured environments. Autistic adults and neurotypical controls viewed a nonverbal animated movie featuring events known to evoke mental state inferences. Both groups exhibited similar ToM network activations and pupil responses to these events, alongside comparable verbal accounts of the mental states portrayed. However, intersubject correlation analysis revealed a significant reduction in response variability among autistic participants throughout the movie's complex visual narrative, affecting brain regions beyond the ToM network. We suggest that the primary challenge for individuals with autism may lie in the idiosyncratic exploration of narratives in unstructured settings, regardless of whether mental state inferences are involved.",

    "abstract": "Dynamins are large GTPases whose primary function is to catalyze membrane scission during endocytosis, but also modulate other cellular processes, such as actin polymerization and vesicle trafficking. Recently, we reported that centronuclear myopathy associated dynamin-2 mutations, p.A618T and p.S619L, impair Ca2+-induced exocytosis of GLUT4 containing vesicles in immortalized human myoblasts. As exocytosis and endocytosis occur within rapid timescales, here we applied high-temporal resolution techniques, such as patch-clamp capacitance measurements and carbon-fiber amperometry to assess the effects of these mutations on these two cellular processes using bovine chromaffin cells as a study model. We found that the expression of any of these dynamin-2 mutants inhibits a dynamin and F-actin dependent form of fast endocytosis triggered by single action potential stimulus, as well as inhibits a slow compensatory endocytosis induced by 500 ms square depolarization. Both dynamin-2 mutants further reduced the exocytosis induced by 500 ms depolarizations, and the frequency of release events and the recruitment of NPY-labelled vesicles to the cell cortex after stimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors with DMPP. They also provoked a significant decrease in the Ca2+-induced formation of new actin filaments in permeabilized chromaffin cells. In summary, our results indicate that the CNM-linked p.A618T and p.S619L mutations in dynamin-2 affect exocytosis and endocytosis, being the disruption of F-actin a possible explanation for these results. These impaired cellular processes might underlie the pathogenic mechanisms associated with these mutations.",

Despite their massive implications, the pathologies of mTBI and rmTBI are not fully understood, with a paucity of information on brain lipid dysregulation following mild injury event(s). To gain more insight on mTBI and rmTBI pathology, a non-targeted spatial lipidomics workflow utilizing ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry imaging was developed to map brain region-specific lipid alterations in rats following injury. Discriminant multivariate models were created for regions of interest including the hippocampus, cortex, and corpus callosum to pinpoint lipid species that differentiated between injured and sham animals. A multivariate model focused on the hippocampus region differentiated injured brain tissues with an area under the curve of 0.994 using only four lipid species. Lipid classes that were consistently discriminant included polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing phosphatidylcholines (PC), lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC), LPC-plasmalogens (LPC-P) and PC potassium adducts. Many of the polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing PC and LPC-P selected have never been previously reported as altered in mTBI. The observed lipid alterations indicate that neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and disrupted sodium-potassium pumps are important pathologies that could serve to explain cognitive deficits associated with rmTBI. Therapeutics which target or attenuate these pathologies may be beneficial to limit persistent damage following a mild brain injury event.",

Yet the possible impact of altered plasticity on real-time striatal neural dynamics during decision-making is unclear. Here, we identified persistent impairments induced by chronic ethanol (EtOH) exposure on cognitive flexibility and striatal decision signals. We showed that after a substantial withdrawal period of EtOH vapor exposure, rats exhibited reduced adaptability and exploratory behavior during a dynamic decision-making task. Reinforcement learning models showed that repeated EtOH exposure enhanced learning from rewards over omissions, leading to increased relative value updates on the selected action. Notably, neural signals in the DMS related to the decision outcome were enhanced, while those related to choice and choice-outcome conjunction were reduced, in EtOH-treated rats compared to the controls. These findings highlight the profound impact of chronic EtOH exposure on adaptive decision-making, pinpointing specific changes in striatal representations of actions and outcomes as underlying mechanisms for cognitive deficits.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease in which an immune-related injury induces fibrosis of the skin, progressing to affect the internal organs in the most serve cases. Type 1 interferon (IFN) signaling plays a major role in SSc disease progression. We have previously shown the chloride intracellular channel 4 (CLIC4) is upregulated in SSc skin fibroblasts and plays an important role in SSc fibrosis. In this study we investigated the role of CLIC4 in SSc keratinocyte biology. Methods: healthy (HC) and SSc skin biopsies were analysed by immunohistochemistry for the expression of CLIC4. The skin keratinocyte cell line Hacats was stimulated with a range of type 1 IFN signaling agonists (POLY I:C, POLY dA:Dt, ODN 2216 and IFN-). CLIC4 was inhibited with the chloride channel inhibitors NPPB and IAA-94 or siRNA. Conditioned media from HC or SSc fibroblasts was employed for indirect co-culture of Hacats and HUVECs. Results: SSc skin biopsies showed high levels of CLIC4 in SSc skin fibroblasts, keratinocytes and endothelial cells compared to HC. Co-culture of Hacats and Huvecs with SSc fibroblast media induced CLIC4 expression. CLIC4 played an important role in type 1 IFN signalling in keratinocytes. Inhibition of CLIC4 blocked TLR3, TLR9 and cGAS mediated activation of the type 1 IFN signaling pathway. Additionally, inhibition of CLIC4 prevented SSc fibroblast media from inducing a type 1 IFN response in keratinocytes. Conclusions: The data presented in this study suggests CLIC4 is a global regulator of type 1 IFN signalling in SSc epithelial cells.",

    "abstract": "Background: While subtle yet discrete clusters of genetic identity across Ireland and Britain have been identified, their demographic history is unclear. Methods: Using genotype data from 6,574 individuals with associated regional Irish or British ancestry, we identified Irish-like and British-like genetic communities using network community detection. We segregated Identity-by-Descent (IBD) and Runs-of-Homozygosity (ROH) segments by length and approximated their corresponding time periods. Through this, we inferred the regional Irish and British demographic histories in these time periods by (1) estimating genetic relatedness between communities, (2) estimating changes in effective population sizes, (3) inferring recent migration rates across Ireland and Britain, and (4) estimating changing affinities to regional European populations. For a subset of the Irish communities, we determined the enrichment/depletion of surnames within the genetic communities. Results: Through patterns of IBD-sharing and ROH, we find evidence of recent population bottlenecks in the Orcadian, Manx and Welsh communities. While the structure in Ireland is subtler, the communities share relatively more IBD segments that are shorter in length, and the genetic differences between the Irish communities are more subtle on average, when compared to the British communities. Regional effective population size trajectories indicate a similar demographic history throughout the island of Ireland. Further, we observe a stable migration corridor between north-east Ireland and south-west Scotland while there is a recent migration barrier between South-Eastern Ireland and Western Ireland. We observed an enrichment of Anglo-Norman and English surnames in the Wexford community while within the West Ulster-Argyll community, we saw an enrichment of Gallowglass and Scottish surnames. Conclusions: Using well-annotated Irish and British reference genotypes, we observed temporal changes in genetic affinities within and between genetic communities in Ireland and Britain. In addition, using effective population size estimates and levels of haplotype-sharing, we detected varying degrees of genetic isolation in some Irish and British genetic communities across time. Using these new insights into the regional demographic history of Ireland and Britain across different time periods, we hope to understand the driving forces of rare allele frequencies and disease risk association within these populations.",

    "abstract": "Focused ultrasound (FUS) is an emerging noinvasive technique for neuromodulation in the central nervous system (CNS). To evaluate the effects of FUS-induced neuromodulation, many studies used behavioral changes, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or electroencephalography (EEG). However, behavioral readouts are often not easily mapped to specific brain activity, EEG has low spatial resolution limited to the surface of the brain and fMRI requires a large importable scanner that limits additional readouts and manipulations. In this context, functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) holds promise to directly monitor the effects of FUS neuromodulation with high spatiotemporal resolution in a large field of view, with a comparatively simple and flexible setup. fUSI uses ultrafast Power Doppler Imaging (PDI) to measure changes in cerebral blood volume, which correlates well with neuronal activity and local field potentials. We designed a setup that aligns a FUS transducer with a linear array to allow immediate subsequent monitoring of the hemodynamic response with fUSI during and after FUS neuromodulation. We established a positive correlation between FUS pressure and the size of the activated area, as well as changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV) and found that unilateral sonications produce bilateral hemodynamic changes with ipsilateral accentuation in mice. We further demonstrated the ability to perform fully noninvasive, transcranial FUS-fUSI in nonhuman primates for the first time by using a lower-frequency transducer configuration.",

    "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) have a wide range of regulatory roles in gene expression, and the subcellular localization identification of LncRNAs is of great value in understanding their biological functions. Graph neural networks can not only utilize sequence characteristics, but also learn hidden features from non-Euclidean data structures to obtain features with powerful characterization capabilities. To learn more fully from the limited LncRNA localization samples and efficiently exploit easily ignored label features, we propose a corrective graph attention network prediction model GATLncLoc+C&S in this paper. Compared with previous methods, the similarity of optimal features is first used to construct the graph. Then, a re-weighted graph attention network R-GAT is constructed and the soft labels obtained from it are used to correct the graph. Finally, the predicted localization label is further obtained by label propagation. Based on the combination of R-GAT and label propagation, GATLncLoc+C&S effectively solves the problems of few samples and data imbalance in LncRNA subcellular localization. The accuracy of GATLncLoc+C&S reached 95.8% and 96.8% in the experiments of 5- and 4-localization benchmark datasets, which reflects the great potential of our proposed method in predicting LncRNA subcellular localization.",

    "abstract": "The increasing availability of massive genetic sequencing data in the clinical setting has triggered the need for appropriate tools to help fully exploit the wealth of information these data possess. GFPrint is a proprietary streaming algorithm designed to meet that need. By extracting the most relevant functional features, GFPrint transforms high-dimensional, noisy genetic sequencing data into an embedded representation, allowing unsupervised models to create data clusters that can be re-mapped to the original clinical information. Ultimately, this allows the identification of genes and pathways relevant to disease onset and progression. GFPrint has been tested and validated using two cancer genomic datasets publicly available. Analysis of the TCGA dataset has identified panels of genes whose mutations appear to negatively influence survival in non-metastatic colorectal cancer (15 genes), epidermoid non-small cell lung cancer (167 genes) and pheochromocytoma (313 genes) patients. Likewise, analysis of the Broad Institute dataset has identified 75 genes involved in pathways related to extracellular matrix reorganization whose mutations appear to dictate a worse prognosis for breast cancer patients. GFPrint is accessible through a secure web portal and can be used in any therapeutic area where the genetic profile of patients influences disease evolution.",

To identify glycosyltransferases, glycans, and glycoproteins essential for melanoma maintenance, we conducted an in vivo growth screen with a pooled shRNA library of glycosyltransferases, lectin microarray profiling of benign nevi and melanoma patient samples, and mass spectrometry-based glycoproteomics. We found that alpha-2,3 sialyltransferases ST3GAL1 and ST3GAL2 and corresponding alpha-2,3-linked sialosides are upregulated in melanoma compared to nevi and are essential for melanoma growth in vivo and in vitro. Glycoproteomics revealed that glycoprotein targets of ST3GAL1 and ST3GAL2 are enriched in transmembrane proteins involved in growth signaling, including the amino acid transporter Solute Carrier Family 3 Member 2 (SLC3A2/CD98hc). CD98hc suppression mimicked the effect of ST3GAL1 and ST3GAL2 silencing, inhibiting melanoma cell proliferation. We found that both CD98hc protein stability and its pro-survival effect in melanoma are dependent upon alpha-2,3 sialylation mediated by ST3GAL1 and ST3GAL2. In summary, our studies reveal that alpha-2,3-sialosides functionally contribute to melanoma maintenance, supporting ST3GAL1 and ST3GAL2 as novel therapeutic targets in these tumors.",

    "abstract": "For clinical translation of oral nanocarriers, simulation of the complex intestinal microenvironment is crucial to evaluate interactions and transport across the intestinal mucosa for predicting the drug's bioavailability. However, permeation studies are often conducted using simplistic cell culture models, overlooking key physiological factors such as tissue composition, morphology, and additional diffusion barriers as constituted by mucus. This oversight may potentially lead to an incomplete evaluation of the nanocarrier-tissue interactions and an overestimation of permeation. In this study, we systematically investigated different 3D tissue models of the human intestine under static cultivation and dynamic flow conditions with respect to tissue morphology, mucus production, and their impact on nanocarrier permeation. Our results revealed that the cell ratio between the different cell types (enterocytes and goblet cells), as well as the choice of culture conditions, had a notable impact on tissue layer thickness, mucus secretion, and barrier impairment, all of which were increased under dynamic flow conditions. Permeation studies with polymeric nanocarriers (PLGA and PEG-PLGA) elucidated that the amount of mucus present in the respective model was the limiting factor for the permeation of PLGA nanocarriers, while tissue topography represented the key factor influencing PEG-PLGA nanocarrier permeation. Furthermore, both nanocarriers exhibited diametrically opposite permeation kinetics in a direct comparison to soluble compounds. In summary, these findings reveal the critical role of the implemented test systems on permeation assessment and emphasize that, in the context of preclinical nanocarrier testing, the choice of in vitro model matters.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation processes, where many potentially coupled features are acquired over time, occur throughout the sciences, from evolutionary biology to disease progression, and particularly in the study of cancer progression. Existing methods for learning the dynamics of such systems typically assume limited (often pairwise) relationships between feature subsets, cross-sectional or untimed observations, small feature sets, or discrete orderings of events. Here we introduce HyperTraPS-CT (Hypercubic Transition Path Sampling in Continuous Time) to compute posterior distributions on continuous-time dynamics of many, arbitrarily coupled, traits in unrestricted state spaces, accounting for uncertainty in observations and their timings. We demonstrate the capacity of HyperTraPS-CT to deal with cross-sectional, longitudinal, and phylogenetic data, which may have no, uncertain, or precisely specified sampling times. HyperTraPS-CT allows positive and negative interactions between arbitrary subsets of features (not limited to pairwise interactions), supporting Bayesian and maximum-likelihood inference approaches to identify these interactions, consequent pathways, and predictions of future and unobserved features. We also introduce a range of visualisations for the inferred outputs of these processes and demonstrate model selection and regularisation for feature interactions. We apply this approach to case studies on the accumulation of mutations in cancer progression and the acquisition of anti-microbial resistance genes in tuberculosis, demonstrating its flexibility and capacity to produce predictions aligned with applied priorities.",

    "abstract": "Blood vessels expand and contract actively, while continuously experiencing dynamic external stresses from the blood flow. The mechanical response of the vessel wall is that of a composite material: its mechanical properties depend on a diverse set of cellular mechanical components, which change dynamically as cells respond to external stress. Mapping the relationship between these underlying cellular processes and emergent tissue mechanics is an on-going challenge, in particular in endothelial cells. Here we use a microstretcher mimicking the native environment of blood vessels to assess both the mechanics and cellular dynamics of an endothelial tube in response to a physiological increase in luminal pressure. The characterization of the instantaneous monolayer elasticity reveals a strain-stiffening, actin-dependent and substrate-responsive behavior. In response to a maintained pressure increase, the tissue displays a fluid-like expansion, accompanied by the reorientation of cell shape and of actin fibers. This actin-driven reorientation depends on focal adhesions and adherens junctions, two key mechanosensors. We introduce a mechanical model coupling actin fiber nematodynamics with active and elastic tension generation by actin fibers in the endothelium, which recapitulates the response to pressure of endothelial tubes.",

In the mouse, the feed-forward, excitatory pathway through the retina is dominated by a chromatic gradient, with green and UV signals primarily processed in the dorsal and ventral retina, respectively. However, at the output of the retina, chromatic tuning is more mixed, suggesting that amacrine cells alter spectral tuning. We genetically targeted the population of 40+ GABAergic amacrine cell types and used two-photon calcium imaging to systematically survey chromatic responses in their dendritic processes. We found that amacrine cells show diverse chromatic responses in different spatial regions of their receptive fields and across the dorso-ventral axis of the retina. Compared to their excitatory inputs from bipolar cells, amacrine cells are less chromatically tuned and less likely to be colour-opponent. We identified 25 functional amacrine cell types that, in addition to their chromatic properties, exhibit distinctive achromatic receptive field properties. A combination of pharmacological interventions and a biologically-inspired deep learning model revealed how lateral inhibition and recurrent excitatory inputs shape chromatic properties of amacrine cells. Our data suggest that amacrine cells balance the strongly biased spectral tuning of excitation in the mouse retina and thereby support increased diversity in chromatic information of the retinal output.",

Sparse in vitro cell culture-based experimental models which recapitulate the molecular basis of CM in humans has impeded progress in our understanding of its etiology. This study employed healthy human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived neuronal cultures stimulated with hemozoin (HMZ)- the malarial toxin as a model for CM. Secretome, qRT-PCR, Metascape, and KEGG pathway analyses were conducted to assess elevated proteins, genes, and pathways. Neuronal cultures treated with HMZ showed enhanced secretion of interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}), interleukin (IL)1-beta (IL-1{beta}), IL-8 and IL-16. Enrichment analysis revealed malaria, positive regulation of cytokine production and positive regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade which confirm inflammatory response to HMZ exposure. KEGG assessment revealed up-regulation of malaria, MAPK and neurodegenerative diseases-associated pathways which corroborates findings from previous studies. Additionally, HMZ induced DNA damage in neurons. This study has unveiled that exposure of neuronal cultures to HMZ, activates molecules and pathways similar to that observed in CM and neurodegenerative diseases.

However, little research has profiled root exudate in vegetable crops or determined their role in rhizosphere microbial community and metabolite composition. It is also not well understood how root exudates and resulting rhizosphere dynamics shift across plant trait diversity and with the development of novel crop genotypes. To address these knowledge gaps, this study paired metabolomics and microbiome analyses to evaluate associations between the composition of exudates, soil bacterial and fungal communities, and soil metabolites across four genotypes of organically produced carrot of differential breeding histories, including two experimental genotypes. Plant genotypes modified soil microbial diversity and composition, and differentially recruited bacterial taxa with demonstrated potential for plant-growth related functions including ammonia oxidation, nitrogen fixation, and phytohormone production. Bacterial rhizosphere recruitment from bulk soil was genotype and root exudate-mediated, while fungal recruitment was not. Moreover, root exudate composition was distinct in an heirloom genotype and a novel nematode resistant genotype, compared to other genotypes tested. Root exudate and rhizosphere metabolite composition was decoupled, and soil metabolites strongly associated with fungal, but not bacterial communities. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that novel crop trait diversity and breeding histories hold consequences for the functional potential of soils through the diversification of root exudate mediated plant-microbe interactions.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria respond to changing environments by altering gene expression. Some responses display probabilistic cell-to-cell variation within isogenic populations. A few paradigmatic examples in animal pathogens have demonstrated that this phenotypic heterogeneity has biological relevance for virulence. We investigate single-cell flagellar expression in relation to type III secretion expression in the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae and describe that both systems undergo phenotypic heterogeneity throughout plant colonization. We establish that high expression of these system carries growth penalties. Stochastic, spatial and time factors shape dynamics of a phenotypically diverse population which displays division of labor during colonization: T3SSON bacteria effectors act as common goods to suppress immunity, allowing the increase of motile bacteria that actively leave the infected tissue before necrosis. This study provides a comprehensive view of how processes underlying bacterial specialization play out in the context of complex and changing environments of biological and applied relevance such as host colonization.",

    "abstract": "Cells need to adapt their transcriptome to quickly match cellular needs in changing environments. mRNA abundance can be controlled by altering both its synthesis and decay. Here we show how, in response to poor nutritional conditions, the bulk of the S. cerevisiae transcriptome undergoes -1 ribosome frameshifts and experiences an accelerated out-of-frame co-translational mRNA decay. Using RNA metabolic labelling, we demonstrate that in poor nutritional conditions, NMD-dependent degradation represents at least one third of the total mRNA decay. We further characterize this mechanism and identify low codon optimality as a key factor for ribosomes to induce out-of-frame mRNA decay. Finally, we show that this phenomenon is conserved from bacteria to humans. Our work provides evidence for a direct regulatory feedback mechanism coupling protein demand with the control of mRNA abundance to limit cellular growth and expands the functional role of mRNA quality control.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotes, chromatin assembly is coupled to DNA replication by the histone chaperone chromatin assembly factor-1 (CAF-1). Here, we demonstrate that CAF-1 maintains the stability of the ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) cluster in budding yeast. Absence of CAF-1 led to homologous recombination (HR)-mediated rDNA copy number changes as well as the production of extrachromosomal rDNA circles in response to Fob1-dependent replication fork arrest at the replication fork barrier (RFB) site in the rDNA. CAF-1-mediated rDNA stabilization depends on its interaction with Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen. The absence of CAF-1 affected neither DNA replication fork arrest at the RFB nor subsequent DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) but led to an increased frequency of DSB end resection, which initiates HR. Absence of CAF-1 caused the derepression of transcription of noncoding RNA from the regulatory promoter E-pro located near the RFB, which contributed to enhanced DSB end resection. Moreover, its absence led to the generation of longer Okazaki fragments, which is indicative of lower nucleosome density in the rDNA. Taken together, our findings suggest that CAF-1-mediated chromatin assembly facilitates silencing of transcription from E-pro and proper nucleosome deposition behind replication forks, leading to the restriction of DSB end resection and subsequent rearrangement-prone DSB repair.",

The discovery relied upon a metabolic glycan labeling strategy in combination with commonly used phase-separation-based RNA isolation. Following the reported procedure, we likewise identified an N-glycosylated species in the RNA fraction. However, our results suggest that the reported RNase sensitivity of the glycosylated species depends on the specific RNA purification method. This suggests the possibility of co-purifying unexpected RNase-insensitive N-glycoconjugates during glycoRNA isolation, hinting at the complex biochemical nature of glycoRNA.

A recent field study indicated that West African forests have among the highest forests gross primary productivity (GPP) yet observed, contradicting models that rank them lower than Amazonian forests. Here, we explore possible reasons for this data-model mismatch. We found the in situ GPP measurements higher than multiple global GPP products at the studied sites in Ghana. The underestimation of GPP by models largely disappears when a standard photosynthesis model is informed by local field-measured values of (a) fractional absorbed photosynthetic radiation (fAPAR), and (b) photosynthetic traits. Satellites systematically underestimate fAPAR in the tropics due to cloud contamination issues. The study highlights the potential widespread underestimation of tropical forests GPP and carbon cycling and hints at the ways forward for model and input data improvement.",

    "abstract": "Chromosome inversions are of unique importance in the evolution of genomes and species because when heterozygous with a standard arrangement chromosome, they suppress meiotic crossovers within the inversion. In Drosophila species, heterozygous inversions also cause the interchromosomal effect, whereby the presence of a heterozygous inversion induces a dramatic increase in crossover frequencies in the remainder of the genome within a single meiosis. To date, the interchromosomal effect has been studied exclusively in species that also have high frequencies of inversions in wild populations. We took advantage of a recently developed approach for generating inversions in Drosophila simulans, a species that does not have inversions in wild populations, to ask if there is an interchromosomal effect. We used the existing chromosome 3R balancer and generated a new chromosome 2L balancer to assay for the interchromosomal effect genetically and cytologically. We found no evidence of an interchromosomal effect in D. simulans. To gain insight into the underlying mechanistic reasons, we qualitatively analyzed the relationship between meiotic double-strand break formation and synaptonemal complex assembly. We find that the synaptonemal complex is assembled prior to double-strand break formation as in D. melanogaster; however, we show that the synaptonemal complex is assembled prior to localization of the oocyte determination factor Orb, whereas in D. melanogaster, synaptonemal complex formation does not begin until Orb is localized. Together, our data show heterozygous inversions in D. simulans do not induce an interchromosomal effect and that there are differences in the developmental programming of the early stages of meiosis.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, is responsible for the recent global pandemic and remains a major source of mortality. Papain-like protease (PLpro) is a target for SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor development, as it is not only essential for viral replication through cleavage of the viral poly-proteins pp1a and pp1ab, but also has de-ubiquitylation and de-ISGylation activities, which can affect innate immune responses. To understand the features of PLpro that dictate activity and anticipate how emerging PLpro variants will affect function, we employed Deep Mutational Scanning to evaluate the mutational effects on enzymatic activity and protein stability in mammalian cells. We confirm features of the active site and identify all mutations in neighboring residues that support or ablate activity. We characterize residues responsible for substrate binding and demonstrate that although the blocking loop is remarkably tolerant to nearly all mutations, its flexibility is important for enzymatic function. We additionally find a connected network of mutations affecting function but not structure that extends far from the active site. Using our DMS libraries we were able to identify drug-escape variants to a common PLpro inhibitor scaffold and predict that plasticity in both the S4 pocket and blocking loop sequence should be considered during the drug design process.",

Registration is an important part of establishing stem cell provenance and connecting cell lines to data derived on those lines. In this study, we sought to understand common barriers to registration, by conducting interviews with forty-eight Australian stem cell stakeholders, including researchers, clinicians, and industry professionals. Australian stem cell researchers do not routinely register their lines, and of those Australian lines captured by an international registry, only a third have completed the registration process. Most registered Australian cell lines miss information about their ethical provenance or key pluripotency characteristics. Incomplete registration is poorly aligned with the goals of open science that registries are founded on, and users themselves expressed concerns about the quality of the partial information provided to the resource. Registration was considered a publication hurdle, and this impacted on user perceptions of usefulness of registration, and lowered the likelihood that they would engage with registries to find resources. Although the Australian community represents a small fraction of registry users, the results of this study may suggest ways for journals, registries, and the stem cell community to improve registration compliance.",

Current approaches include engineering multicellular patterning, controlling differentiation, and implementing cooperative cellular behaviors in model systems. Synthetic biology tools enable these pursuits with genetic circuits that drive customized responses to arbitrary stimuli, synthetic receptors that enable orthogonal signaling channels, and light- or drug-inducible systems that enable precise spatial and temporal control of cell function. Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) offer a well-studied and genetically tractable pluripotent chassis for pursuing synthetic development questions however, there is minimal characterization of existing synthetic biology tools in mESCs and we lack genetic toolkits for rapid iterative engineering of synthetic development workflows. Here, we began to address this challenge by characterizing small molecule and cell contact-inducible systems for gene expression in and differentiation of mESCs. We show that small molecule and cell-contact inducible systems work reliably and efficiently for controlling expression of arbitrary genetic payloads. Furthermore, we show that these systems can drive direct differentiation of mESCs into neurons. Each of these systems can readily be used on their own or in combination, opening many possibilities for studying developmental principles with high precision.",

    "abstract": "The ability to express transgenes at specified levels is critical for understanding cellular behaviors, and for applications in gene and cell therapy. Transfection, viral vectors, and other gene delivery methods produce varying protein expression levels, with limited quantitative control, while targeted knock-in and stable selection are inefficient and slow. Active compensation mechanisms can improve precision, but the need for additional proteins or lack of tunability have prevented their widespread use. Here, we introduce a toolkit of compact, synthetic miRNA-based circuit modules that provide precise, tunable control of transgenes across diverse cell types. These circuits, termed DIMMERs (Dosage-Invariant miRNA-Mediated Expression Regulators) use multivalent miRNA regulatory interactions within an incoherent feed-forward loop architecture to achieve nearly uniform protein expression over more than two orders of magnitude variation in underlying gene dosages or transcription rates. They also allow coarse and fine control of expression, and are portable, functioning across diverse cell types. In addition, a heuristic miRNA design algorithm enables the creation of orthogonal circuit variants that independently control multiple genes in the same cell. These circuits allowed dramatically improved CRISPR imaging, and super-resolution imaging of EGFR receptors with transient transfections. The toolbox provided here should allow precise, tunable, dosage-invariant expression for research, gene therapy, and other biotechnology applications.",

Widespread in bacteria and eukaryotes, they regulate a variety of physiological processes, from hormone secretion in animals to carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms.

Here, we use experimental evolution to study the interplay between fitness and circadian regulation in the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. After 1,200 generations under continuous, high-intensity illumination, we obtained a strain that grew six times faster than its ancestral counterpart. Genome sequencing revealed three mutations fixed in the population, two of which replicated the fast-growing phenotype in the wild-type. A deletion in SasA, a key circadian regulator, was essential for fast growth. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed that this mutation perturbed the rhythmicity of the cycle, while simultaneously locking the cell in a transcriptomic response to high intensity illumination. A comparison with another fast-growing isolate, UTEX 2973, showed convergent transcriptomic states despite different driving mutations. Our results indicate that the clock acts not only as a timekeeping device, but also as an adaptive mechanism to optimize growth across diverse ecological conditions.",

Class A beta-lactamase genes on chromosomes (blaCTX-M, blaTEM) were clustered with antibiotic resistance genes associated with other classes of antibiotics (sulfonamides and aminoglycosides) along with insertional elements. ESBL genes such as blaCTX-M, blaTEM, and blaSHV were also detected on conjugable plasmids of IncF and IncI incompatibility types. One novel IncF plasmid (pSHV2A_ESBLF) was identified in which carried a multi-drug resistance genotype (blaSHV-2A, aadA22, aac3, aph6, tetA, and sul1) in addition to a mer (mercury resistance) operon, colicin, and aerobactin genes. Shotgun metagenomic analysis of the E. coli-originating wastewater samples showed the presence of class A beta-lactamases; however, the ESBL genes identified in the E. coli genomes were below the detection limits. Other ESBL-associated genes (i.e., blaOXA.11, blaFOX.7, and blaGES.17) were identified in the wastewater samples and their occurrences were correlated with the core microbial genera (e.g., Paraprevotella). In both the E. coli genomes and the wastewater samples, tetracycline, aminoglycoside, and beta-lactam resistance determinants frequently co-occurred.

    "abstract": "Current state-of-the-art spatial omics approaches suffer from the drawback that they are tissue section-based and thus inherently 2-dimensional. A full understanding of biological processes will only be possible when such data is available in 3-dimensions (3D). Here, we introduce Cell 3D Positioning by Optical encoding (C3PO) - the first technique capable of reconstructing the 3D positions of cells in a tissue, after they have been fully dissociated for single-cell omics analysis. It imposes a Cartesian coordinate system of positions on the tissue and cells of interest, before dissociation. This is created by multiple orthogonal spatial gradients of active fluorophores, carefully shaped by a 3D bleaching method, such that each position in the tissue is encoded by a unique fluorescent address. Upon dissociation of the tissue the fluorescent addresses of the cells can be read via an appropriate device (such as a FACS machine) to computationally reconstruct the tissue in 3D, before omics are performed downstream. Here, we show two proof-of-principle results for C3PO. First, pure C3PO without omics, to reconstruct the 3D geometry of a developing mouse limb bud. Second, an application of C3PO to spatial transcriptomics, revealing the expression patterns of 73 genes with interesting gene expression patterns in the developing limb.. C3PO is a genuinely novel approach to reconstruct the original 3D positions of cells in a tissue after dissociation. Combined with transcriptomics, it can play a significant role in the study of any tissue or organ in which 3D structure and geometry is important, such as developmental biology, cancer biology and neuroscience. It is not an omics technique per se, and in the future could be combined with the growing family of other omics technologies.",

    "abstract": "Size is commonly used as a master trait to characterize pelagic organisms as it affects a range of processes and impact marine biogeochemical cycles and services. Yet, a holistic understanding of what environmental factors shape size structure is lacking for most mesoplankton. As part of the Pelagic Size Structure database, we explore the linkages between environmental factors and global compilations of Rhizarian, colonial N2-fixer, and Crustacean size spectra measured from Underwater Vision Profilers or benchtop scanners. We found that iron, alongside temperature, plays a disproportionate role in shaping their spectral biogeography. Our results highlight the effect of dust on N2-fixers and Rhizarians while total iron, comprising organic and mineral compounds, explained most of the variance in Crustaceans size structure. Using machine learning models, we predicted their size structure at the global scale with relatively high R2 of 0.93, 0.84, and 0.66. We hope our predictions can support further assessment of their role in biogeochemical processes under present and future forcings.",

    "abstract": "Serpentine ecosystems are characterized by multiple environmental stressors such as high levels of trace metals such as nickel (Ni), low availability of macronutrients and low water retention. These harsh environmental conditions exert a strong selective force on the vegetation, but their effect on the functional trait composition of the communities remains unknown. In 26 plots on four serpentine sites on Lesbos Island (Greece), we measured six leaf functional traits related to resource acquisition and stress resistance on the 20 most abundant plant species. We quantified the proportion of variance explained by inter- and intraspecific traits difference and tested if individual species show changes in trait values explained by soil Ni content. We investigated the selective value and the community level changes for each trait along the natural soil Ni gradient using a species multilevel model approach and functional diversity analyses. We also tested the role of the abundant serpentine endemic Odontarrhena lesbiaca in driving these patterns. Intraspecific variation explained by soil Ni content is smaller than 2%, with most of the variance being explained by interspecific differences in trait values and most species do not show significant changes in trait values. At the community level, leaf thickness is the only trait driving an increase in species abundance along the gradient. Functional diversity analyses suggest a shift towards a stress tolerance syndrome (thick leaves with low SLA values) on Ni rich soils, but an increase in the diversity of these traits. However, these patterns are driven by the increasing abundance of O. lesbiaca. When this species is excluded, there is an increase in the community mean leaf area and SLA, suggesting that the community does not respond to metallic stress with classical stress syndromes. Intraspecific variation in leaf trait responds little to soil metal toxicity. Endemic species harbour original trait values compared to species with broad distribution which should justify their conservation as a priority.",

    "abstract": "In migratory species, the temporal phases of the annual cycle are intrinsically linked to seasonally shifting geographic ranges. Despite intense interest in the annual cycle ecology of migration, a synthetic understanding of the relationship between the biogeography and phenology of seasonal migration remains elusive. Here, we interrogate the spatiotemporal structure of the annual cycle in a novel phylogenetic comparative framework. We use eBird, a massive avian occurrence dataset, to demarcate and measure in a consistent manner among species the portions of the annual cycle when a geographic distribution is stationary versus dynamic due to migration. Through comparative analyses of the durations of annual cycle stages for 150 species of migratory birds breeding in North America, we show that the duration of the migratory periods is remarkably consistent among species and is unrelated to the distance between breeding and nonbreeding locations. In other words, the seasonal distributions of long-distance migrants shift between their geographically distant stationary phases in the same amount of time as short-distance migrants, suggesting that individuals of long-distance migratory species have more synchronous periods of migration and likely a faster individual migratory pace than short-distance migrants. Our results further show that the amount of time a species spends on the breeding grounds is strongly inversely related to time spent on the nonbreeding grounds, revealing the length of the breeding versus nonbreeding stationary period to be the primary source of species-level variation in the pacing of the annual cycle, as opposed to the time needed for the migratory period. Further, our study reveals that the amount of time spent annually on the breeding versus nonbreeding grounds predicts the distance between breeding and nonbreeding locations, demonstrating key linkages between the biogeography of the migratory cycle, its phenology, and the evolution of life history tradeoffs.",

    "abstract": "In populations with separate sexes, genetic load due to deleterious mutations may be expressed differently in males and females. Evidence from insect models suggests that selection against mutations is stronger in males, with a positive intersexual correlation for fitness. This pattern will reduce deleterious allele frequencies at the expense of males, such that female mean fitness is greater than expected, preserving population persistence in the face of high mutation rates. While previous studies focus on reproductive success, mutation load depends on total selection in each sex, including selection for viability. In fruit flies, we might expect minimal sex differences in viability effects, since male and female larvae behave similarly, but many genes show sex-biased expression in larvae. We measured the sex-specific viability effects of nine \"marker\" mutations and 33 mutagenized chromosomes. We find that both types of mutations generally reduce viability in both sexes. Among marker mutations we detect instances of sex biased selection in both directions, but mutagenized chromosomes show little sign of sex-specific mutational variance. We conclude that some mutations can indeed affect viability in a sex-specific manner, but that the pattern of male-biased mutational effects observed previously for reproductive success is not apparent at the pre-reproductive stage.",

    "abstract": "The effects of environmental stress on animal life are gaining importance with climate change. Diapause is a dormancy program that occurs in response to an adverse environment, followed by resumption of development and reproduction upon the return of favorable conditions. Diapause is a complex trait, so we leveraged the Drosophila genetic reference panel (DGRP) lines and conducted a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) to characterize the genetic basis of diapause. We assessed post-diapause and non-diapause fecundity across all DGRP lines. GWAS revealed 546 genetic variants, encompassing single nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions and deletions associated with post-diapause fecundity. We identified 291 candidate diapause-associated genes, 40 of which had previously been associated with diapause. 89 of the candidates were associated with more than one SNP. Gene network analysis indicated that the diapause-associated genes were primarily linked to neuronal and reproductive system development. Similarly, comparison with results from other fly GWAS revealed the greatest overlap with olfactory-behavior-associated and fecundity-and-lifespan-associated genes. An RNAi screen of the top candidates identified two neuronal genes, Dip- and Scribbler, to be required during recovery for post-diapause fecundity. We complemented the genetic analysis with a test of which neurons are required for successful diapause. We found that although amputation of the antenna had little to no effect on non-diapause lifespan, it reduced diapause lifespan and postdiapause fecundity. We further show that olfactory receptor neurons and temperature-sensing neurons are required for successful recovery from diapause. Our results provide insights into the molecular, cellular, and genetic basis of adult reproductive diapause in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "The treatment of many aggressive cancers remains a significant unmet medical need. An aberrant dependence of tumors on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation pathways has been well characterized in mediating the progression of pancreatic cancers, as well as some other malignancies. However, the discovery and development of new therapeutic strategies targeting or manipulating this pathway in pancreatic tumors has been relatively slow when compared with other cancers, limiting the current options for treating patients. One key technical challenge in discovering new therapies has been the limited ability of cancer cell lines when grown in 2D conditions to recapitulate the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation pathways in vitro that have been observed in vivo. In part, this is because 2D cultures fail to mimic the extracellular 3D tumoral environment. More generally, the translation of data based on 2D pancreatic cancer cell culture systems have also been constraining options for discovering new therapies. Conversely, 3D cultures can provide an improved technology platform in which pathologically relevant pathways in tumors can be recapitulated and analyzed in vitro. In this study, we have demonstrated in 3D cultures the reconstruction of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation genotype in vitro, which more closely resembles that observed in vivo. Our study highlights the value of using transcriptomic readouts as a method to demonstrate the relevance and utility of 3D preclinical models in vitro, when grown in a more physiological extracellular environment. This key technological advance can now better enable the discovery and subsequent development of new therapeutic strategies targeting disease-relevant pathways found in pancreatic and other tumors.",

    "abstract": "Octopamine (OA), analogous to norepinephrine in vertebrates, is an essential monoamine neurotransmitter in invertebrates that plays a significant role in various biological functions, including olfactory associative learning. However, the spatial and temporal dynamics of OA in vivo remain poorly understood due to limitations associated with the currently available methods used to detect it. To overcome these limitations, we developed a genetically encoded GPCR activation-based (GRAB) OA sensor called GRABOA1.0. This sensor is highly selective for OA and exhibits a robust and rapid increase in fluorescence in response to extracellular OA. Using GRABOA1.0, we monitored OA release in the Drosophila mushroom body (MB), the fly's learning center, and found that OA is released in response to both odor and shock stimuli in an aversive learning model. This OA release requires acetylcholine (ACh) released from Kenyon cells, signaling via nicotinic ACh receptors. Finally, we discovered that OA amplifies aversive learning behavior by augmenting dopamine-mediated punishment signals via Oct{beta}1R in dopaminergic neurons, leading to alterations in synaptic plasticity within the MB. Thus, our new GRABOA1.0 sensor can be used to monitor OA release in real-time under physiological conditions, providing valuable insights into the cellular and circuit mechanisms that underlie OA signaling.",
