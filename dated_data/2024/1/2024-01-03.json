    "abstract": "Machine learning research has achieved large performance gains on a wide range of tasks by expanding the learning target from mean rewards to entire probability distributions of rewards -- an approach known as distributional reinforcement learning (RL)1. The mesolimbic dopamine system is thought to underlie RL in the mammalian brain by updating a representation of mean value in the striatum2,3, but little is known about whether, where, and how neurons in this circuit encode information about higher-order moments of reward distributions4. To fill this gap, we used high-density probes (Neuropixels) to acutely record striatal activity from well-trained, water-restricted mice performing a classical conditioning task in which reward mean, reward variance, and stimulus identity were independently manipulated. In contrast to traditional RL accounts, we found robust evidence for abstract encoding of variance in the striatum. Remarkably, chronic ablation of dopamine inputs disorganized these distributional representations in the striatum without interfering with mean value coding. Two-photon calcium imaging and optogenetics revealed that the two major classes of striatal medium spiny neurons -- D1 and D2 MSNs -- contributed to this code by preferentially encoding the right and left tails of the reward distribution, respectively. We synthesize these findings into a new model of the striatum and mesolimbic dopamine that harnesses the opponency between D1 and D2 MSNs5-15 to reap the computational benefits of distributional RL.",

    "abstract": "Network neuroscience has emerged as an indispensable tool for studying brain structure and function. Currently, the network-based statistic (NBS) procedure is widely used for dealing with massive multiple testing/comparison problems in brain networks. However, the NBS requires choosing a hard cluster-forming threshold, lacking objective rules. A powerful and flexible statistical framework is urgently needed with growing interest in finer-grained network explorations across modalities and scales. Here, we introduce a permutation-based framework--\"Threshold-Free Network-Oriented Statistics\" (TFNOS). It integrates two \"threshold-free\" pathways: traversing all cluster-forming thresholds (TT) and using predefined clusters (PC). The TT procedure, building upon the threshold-free network-based statistics, requires setting additional parameters. The PC procedures comprise six variants given the degree of freedom in pooling data, null distribution construction, and controlled error rate. Using numerical simulations, we evaluated the performance of the TT procedure under 600 parameter combinations, then benchmarked TFNOS procedures and baselines across different topologies of effects, sample sizes, and effect sizes, and finally provided illustrative examples with real data. We offer recommended parameter values that allow the TT procedure to stably maintain leading power, while empirically controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) beyond only weakly controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). Notably, the relevant parameters commonly employed in the field appear overly liberal. Furthermore, for the PC procedures, FDR-controlling variants showed improved power compared to FWER-controlling variants, and some of them are simple but do not compromise power. The nonparametric PC procedures allow the selection of any test statistics considered appropriate. Overall, the TFNOS is a generalized framework for inference on edges/nodes of undirected/directed brain networks. We provide empirical and principled criteria for selecting appropriate procedures and may enhance the reproducibility and sensitivity of future brain research.",

    "abstract": "Immune response genes are highly polymorphic in humans and mice, with heterogeneity amongst loci driving strain-specific host defense responses. The inadvertent retention of polymorphic loci can introduce confounding phenotypes, leading to erroneous conclusions, and impeding scientific advancement. In this study, we employ a combination of RNAseq and variant calling analyses and identify a substantial region of 129S genome, including the highly polymorphic Nlrp1 locus proximal to Nlrp3, in one of the most commonly used mouse models of NLRP3 deficiency. We show that increased expression of 129S NLRP1b sensitizes Nlrp3-/- macrophages to NLRP1 inflammasome activation. Furthermore, the presence of 129S genome leads to altered gene and protein regulation across multiple cell-types, including of the key tissue-resident macrophage marker, TIM4. To address the challenge of resolving NLRP3-dependent phenotypes, we introduce and validate a conditional Nlrp3 allele, enabling precise temporal and cell-type-specific control over Nlrp3 deletion. Our study establishes a generic framework to identify functionally relevant SNPs and assess genomic contamination in transgenic mice. This allows for unambiguous attribution of phenotypes to the target gene and advances the precision and reliability of research in the field of host defense responses.",

    "abstract": "The immune system comprises multiple cell lineages and heterogeneous subsets found in blood and tissues throughout the body. While human immune responses differ between sites and over age, the underlying sources of variation remain unclear as most studies are limited to peripheral blood. Here, we took a systems approach to comprehensively profile RNA and surface protein expression of over 1.25 million immune cells isolated from blood, lymphoid organs, and mucosal tissues of 24 organ donors aged 20-75 years. We applied a multimodal classifier to annotate the major immune cell lineages (T cells, B cells, innate lymphoid cells, and myeloid cells) and their corresponding subsets across the body, leveraging probabilistic modeling to define bases for immune variations across donors, tissue, and age. We identified dominant tissue-specific effects on immune cell composition and function across lineages for lymphoid sites, intestines, and blood-rich tissues. Age-associated effects were intrinsic to both lineage and site as manifested by macrophages in mucosal sites, B cells in lymphoid organs, and T and NK cells in blood-rich sites. Our results reveal tissue-specific signatures of immune homeostasis throughout the body and across different ages. This information provides a basis for defining the transcriptional underpinnings of immune variation and potential associations with disease-associated immune pathologies across the human lifespan.",

    "abstract": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) persistently infects 95% of adults worldwide and is associated with multiple human lymphomas that express characteristic EBV latency programs used by the virus to navigate the B-cell compartment. Upon primary infection, the EBV latency III program, comprised of six Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigens (EBNA) and two Latent Membrane Protein (LMP) antigens, drives infected B-cells into germinal center (GC). By incompletely understood mechanisms, GC microenvironmental cues trigger the EBV genome to switch to the latency II program, comprised of EBNA1, LMP1 and LMP2A and observed in GC-derived Hodgkin lymphoma. To gain insights into pathways and epigenetic mechanisms that control EBV latency reprogramming as EBV-infected B-cells encounter microenvironmental cues, we characterized GC cytokine effects on EBV latency protein expression and on the EBV epigenome. We confirmed and extended prior studies highlighting GC cytokine effects in support of the latency II transition. The T-follicular helper cytokine interleukin 21 (IL-21), which is a major regulator of GC responses, and to a lesser extent IL-4 and IL-10, hyper-induced LMP1 expression, while repressing EBNA expression. However, follicular dendritic cell cytokines including IL-15 and IL-27 downmodulate EBNA but not LMP1 expression.\n\nCRISPR editing highlighted that STAT3 and STAT5 were necessary for cytokine mediated EBNA silencing via epigenetic effects at the EBV genomic C promoter. By contrast, STAT3 was instead necessary for LMP1 promoter epigenetic remodeling, including gain of activating histone chromatin marks and loss of repressive polycomb repressive complex silencing marks. Thus, EBV has evolved to coopt STAT signaling to oppositely regulate the epigenetic status of key viral genomic promoters in response to GC cytokine cues.\n\nAuthor SummaryA longstanding question has remained how Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) epigenetically switches between latency programs as it navigates the B-cell compartment. EBV uses its latency III program to stimulate newly infected B cell growth and then trafficking into secondary lymphoid tissue germinal centers (GC). In latency III, the viral C promoter stimulates expression of six Epstein-Barr nuclear antigens (EBNA) that in turn induce two latent membrane proteins (LMP). However, knowledge has remained incomplete about how GC microenvironmental cues trigger switching to latency II, where only one EBNA and two LMP are expressed, a program observed in Hodgkin lymphoma. Building on prior evidence that GC cytokines are a major cue, we systematically tested effects of cytokines secreted by GC-resident T follicular helper and follicular dendritic cells on EBV latency gene expression and on epigenetic remodeling of their promoters. This highlighted that a range of GC cytokines repress latency III EBNA, while only several support LMP1 expression, major events in the transition between the latency III and II programs. We identified key downstream roles of JAK/STAT signaling in relaying cytokine signals to the EBV epigenome, including obligatory STAT3 and 5 roles in rewiring of C and LMP promoter histone epigenetic marks.",

    "abstract": "Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by numerous species of Leishmania parasites, including Leishmania major. The parasite is transmitted by several species of sandfly vectors and infects myeloid cells leading to a myriad of inflammatory responses, immune dysregulations, and disease manifestations. Every cell undergoes autophagy, a self-regulated degradative process that permits the cells to recycle damaged or worn-out organelles in order to maintain cellular health and homeostasis. Studies have shown that Leishmania modulates their host cell autophagic machinery and there are indications that the parasite-specific autophagic processes may be valuable for parasite virulence and survival. However, the role of autophagy in Leishmania is inconclusive because of the limited tools available to study the Leishmania-specific autophagic machinery. Here, we describe methods to study and definitively confirm autophagy in Leishmania major. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) allowed us to visualize Leishmania autophagosomes, especially those containing damaged mitochondrial content, as well as dividing mitochondria with ongoing fusion/fission processes. Flow cytometry enabled us to identify the amount of acridine orange dye accumulating in the acidic vacuolar compartments in Leishmania major by detecting fluorescence in the red laser when autophagic inhibitors or enhancers were included. These methods will advance studies that aim to understand autophagic regulation in Leishmania parasites that could provide insights into developing improved therapeutic targets against leishmaniasis.",

    "abstract": "Omic technologies at single-cell resolution are reshaping our understanding of cellular diversity. The generation of cell atlases that capture the cellular composition of an entire individual is progressing rapidly. However, the science of organising and extracting information from these atlases is still in its infancy and for many biomedical researchers atlas exploration remains challenging. Here, we leveraged extensive experience in single-cell data analytics to pinpoint three major accessibility barriers to cell atlases, related to (i) programming skill or language, (ii) scalability, and (iii) dissemination standards. To help researchers overcome these barriers, we developed cell atlas approximations, a computational approach enabling the analysis of cell atlases across organs and organisms without programming skills, rapidly, and at scale. The web interface at https://atlasapprox.org facilitates the exploration of cell atlases in 19 species across the tree of life through a chatbot driven by frontend natural language processing. In parallel, application programming interfaces streamline data access for computational researchers and include specialised packages for Python, R, JavaScript, and Bash. Supported queries include marker gene identification, cross-organ comparisons, cell embeddings, gene sequences, searches for similar features, and bidirectional zoom between cell types and cell states. Most queries are answered in less than 1.5 seconds thanks to lossy data compression algorithms based on cell annotations and similarity graphs. Compared to traditional cell atlas analysis, this approach can reduce data size by more than 100 times and accelerate workflows by up to 100,000 times. Atlas approximations aim to make the exploration of cell atlases accessible to anyone in the world.",

Straightforward and adaptable modular multifunctional nanotherapeutics represent groundbreaking advancements and are crucial to promoting broad application in both academic research and clinical practice. In this study, we focused on exploring a specific targeting modular and functional oral nanotherapy, serving as \"one stone\", for the directed localization of inflammation and the regulation of redox homeostasis, thereby achieving effects against \"two birds\" for UC treatment. The designed nanotherapeutic agent OPNs@LMWH, which has a core-shell structure composed of oxidation-sensitive {varepsilon}-polylysine nanoparticles (OPNs) in the core and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in the shell, exhibited specific active targeting effects and therapeutic efficacy simultaneously. We qualitatively and quantificationally confirmed that OPNs@LMWH possessed high integrin M-mediated immune cellular uptake efficiency and preferentially accumulated in inflamed lesions. Compared with bare OPNs, OPNs@LMWH exhibited enhanced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and anti-inflammatory effects. After oral administration of OPNs@LMWH to mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, robust resilience was observed. OPNs@LMWH effectively ameliorated oxidative stress and inhibited the activation of inflammation-associated signalling pathways while simultaneously bolstering the protective mechanisms of the colonic epithelium. Overall, these findings underscore the compelling dual functionalities of OPNs@LMWH, which enable effective oral delivery to inflamed sites, thereby facilitating precise UC management.",

Previous studies have unraveled the contributions of transcriptional regulations in modulating the resistance to seawater salinity fluctuations in the greater amberjack, but no attentions have been ever paid to post-transcriptional mechanisms, which also play an important role in fish growth, development and adaptation to environmental stress. In this study, we performed a comparative transcriptomic analysis to investigate the genome-wide alternative splicing (AS) dynamics in the greater amberjack under both hypo- (10 ppt) and hyper-salinity stresses. In the gills, 461 and 426 differential spliced genes (DSGs) were identified in response to 10 ppt and 40 ppt salinity, respectively. For both stress scenarios, the genes related to sodium ion transport were prone to produce a higher proportion of isoforms including more exons, suggesting an enhancement of mainly involved in. GO enrichment results showed that these genes were mainly involved in sodium ion adjustment in response to the deviation of optimal water salinity. Comparatively, pH regulation, developmental process, and positive regulation of Wnt signaling pathway were exclusively activated under 10 ppt salinity, while lipid transport and regulation of cell division were enhanced when exposed to 40 ppt saline. In the kidneys, 468 more-exon inclusive DSGs were found in response to both hypo- and hyper-salinity stress, which mainly associated with antioxidant processes, such as sulfur compound biosynthetic process and peroxisome organization. Furthermore, AS events were found to modulate different physiological processes from gene expression, suggesting AS played relatively independent role in salinity stress response in the greater amberjack. These novel findings provide us a better understanding of the post-transcriptional mechanisms underlying the resistance of the greater amberjack to ambient salinity oscillation and also provide a genetic basis for the conservation of marine organisms and biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "Traditional drug discovery encounters challenges, including high costs, time-intensive processes, and inherent risks. Drug repurposing emerges as a compelling alternative strategy to identify new indications for investigational or approved drugs, circumventing these obstacles. Among the various drug repurposing methods, the Disease-specific Signature-based Connectivity Map (Cmap) approach is widely utilized. However, the commonly employed method for constructing disease-specific signatures, known as Differentially Expressed Genes (DEG), faces issues related to inconsistencies between dysregulated genes and the prognosis of genes in tumor tissue, as well as discrepancies in prognosis genes between tumor and normal tissues.\n\nIn this study, we propose a novel approach, Prognosis Consistency Scoring (PCS), aimed at addressing these inconsistencies. PCS measures the consistency of gene prognosis between tumor and normal tissues by combining the Recurrence-Free Survival (RFS) prognosis power of genes in both contexts. Disease-specific signatures are then constructed based on PCS, and drug repurposing is performed using the Cmap and Lincs Unified Environment (CLUE). Validation of predicted drugs is conducted using data from DrugBank and ClinicalTrials databases.\n\nOur findings reveal that the aforementioned inconsistencies are pervasive. Compared to signatures based on DEGs, PCS-based signatures exhibit superior performance, identifying more drugs with higher prediction accuracy, as confirmed by DrugBank annotations. Notably, a significant proportion of predicted drugs without corresponding indications were subsequently validated in the ClinicalTrials database. Additionally, PCS-based signatures demonstrate elevated disease specificity and association with Drug Related Gene (DRG).",

With the multiplication of genomic data available, very efficient bioinformatic tools for automatic SMBGC detection have been developed. Nevertheless, most of these tools identify SMBGCs based on sequence similarity with enzymes typically involved in specialised metabolism and thus may miss SMBGCs coding for under characterised enzymes. Here we present SYNTERUPTOR (https://bioi2.i2bc.paris-saclay.fr/synteruptor), a program that identifies genomic islands, known to be enriched in SMBGCs, in the genomes of closely related species. With this tool, we identified a SMBGC in the genome of Streptomyces ambofaciens ATCC23877, undetected by earlier versions of antiSMASH, and experimentally demonstrated that it directs the biosynthesis of two metabolites, one of which was identified as sphydrofuran. SYNTERUPTOR is also a valuable resource for the delineation of individual SMBGCs within antiSMASH regions that may encompass multiple clusters, and for refining the boundaries of these SMBGCs.",

    "abstract": "As an alternative to target-driven drug discovery, phenotype-driven approaches identify compounds that counteract the overall disease effects by analyzing phenotypic signatures. Our study introduces a novel approach to this field, aiming to expand the search space for new therapeutic agents. We introduce PDGO_SCPLOWRAPHERC_SCPLOW, a causally-inspired graph neural network model designed to predict arbitrary perturbagens - sets of therapeutic targets - capable of reversing disease effects. Unlike existing methods that learn responses to perturbations, PDGO_SCPLOWRAPHERC_SCPLOW solves the inverse problem, which is to infer the perturbagens necessary to achieve a specific response - i.e., directly predicting perturbagens by learning which perturbations elicit a desired response. Experiments across eight datasets of genetic and chemical perturbations show that PDGO_SCPLOWRAPHERC_SCPLOW successfully predicted effective perturbagens in up to 9% additional test samples and ranked therapeutic targets up to 35% higher than competing methods. A key innovation of PDGO_SCPLOWRAPHERC_SCPLOW is its direct prediction capability, which contrasts with the indirect, computationally intensive models traditionally used in phenotype-driven drug discovery that only predict changes in phenotypes due to perturbations. The direct approach enables PDGO_SCPLOWRAPHERC_SCPLOW to train up to 30 times faster, representing a significant leap in efficiency. Our results suggest that PDGO_SCPLOWRAPHERC_SCPLOW can advance phenotype-driven drug discovery, offering a fast and comprehensive approach to identifying therapeutically useful perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Deciphering the intricate regulatory code governing cell-type-specific gene expression is a fundamental goal in genetics. Current methods struggle to capture the complex interplay between gene distal regulatory sequences and cell context. We developed a computational approach, BOM (Bag-of-Motifs), which represents cis-regulatory sequences by the type and number of TF binding motifs it contains, irrespective of motif order, orientation, and spacing. This simple yet powerful representation allows BOM to efficiently capture the complexity of cell-type-specific information encoded within these sequences. We apply BOM to mouse, human, and zebrafish distal regulatory regions, demonstrating remarkable accuracy. Notably, the method outperforms more complex deep learning models at the same task using fewer parameters. BOM can also uncover cross-species sequence similarities unrecognized by genome alignments. We experimentally validate our in silico predictions using enhancer reporter assay, showing that motifs with the most significant explanatory power are sequence determinants of cell-type specific enhancer activity. BOM offers a novel systematic framework for studying cell-type or condition-specific cis-regulatory sequences. Using BOM, we demonstrate the existence of a highly predictive sequence code at distal regulatory regions in mammals driven by TF binding motifs.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPrincipal component analysis (PCA), a standard approach to analysis and visualization of large datasets, is commonly used in biomedical research for detecting similarities and differences among groups of samples. We initially used conventional PCA as a tool for critical quality control of batch and trend effects in multi-omic profiling data produced by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project of the NCI. We found, however, that conventional PCA visualizations were often hard to interpret when inter-batch differences were moderate in comparison with intra-batch differences; it was also difficult to quantify batch effects objectively. We, therefore, sought enhancements to make the method more informative in those and analogous settings.\n\nResultsWe have developed algorithms and a toolbox of enhancements to conventional PCA that improve the detection, diagnosis, and quantitation of differences between or among groups, e.g., groups of molecularly profiled biological samples. The enhancements include (i) computed group centroids; (ii) sample-dispersion rays; (iii) differential coloring of centroids, rays, and sample data points; (iii) trend trajectories; and (iv) a novel separation index (DSC) for quantitation of differences among groups.\n\nConclusionsPCA-Plus has been our most useful single tool for analyzing, visualizing, and quantitating batch effects, trend effects, and class differences in molecular profiling data of many types: mRNA expression, microRNA expression, DNA methylation, and DNA copy number. An early version of PCA-Plus has been used as the central graphical visualization in our MBatch package for near-real-time surveillance of data for analysis working groups in more than 70 TCGA, PanCancer Atlas, PanCancer Analysis of Whole Genomes, and Genome Data Analysis Network projects of the NCI. The algorithms and software are generic, hence applicable more generally to other types of multivariate data as well.

    "abstract": "Cdt1 is a protein critical for DNA replication licensing and is well-established to be a binding partner of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex. Cdt1 has also been demonstrated to have an emerging, \"moonlighting\" role at the kinetochore via direct binding to microtubules and to the Ndc80 complex. However, it is not known how the structure and conformations of Cdt1 could allow for these multiple, completely unique sets of protein complexes. And while there exist multiple robust methods to study entirely folded or entirely unfolded proteins, structure-function studies of combined, mixed folded/disordered proteins remain challenging. It this work, we employ multiple orthogonal biophysical and computational techniques to provide a detailed structural characterization of human Cdt1 92-546. DSF and DSCD show both folded winged helix (WH) domains of Cdt1 are relatively unstable. CD and NMR show the N-terminal and the linker regions are intrinsically disordered. Using DLS and SEC-MALS, we show that Cdt1 is polydisperse, monomeric at high concentrations, and without any apparent inter-molecular self-association. SEC-SAXS of the monomer in solution enabled computational modeling of the protein in silico. Using the program SASSIE, we performed rigid body Monte Carlo simulations to generate a conformational ensemble. Using experimental SAXS data, we filtered for conformations which did and did not fit our data. We observe that neither fully extended nor extremely compact Cdt1 conformations are consistent with our SAXS data. The best fit models have the N-terminal and linker regions extended into solution and the two folded domains close to each other in apparent \"folded over\" conformations. The best fit Cdt1 conformations are consistent with a function as a scaffold protein which may be sterically blocked without the presence of binding partners. Our studies also provide a template for combining experimental and computational biophysical techniques to study mixed-folded proteins.",

    "abstract": "Immunomodulatory imide drugs (IMiDs) degrade specific C2H2 zinc finger degrons in transcription factors, making them effective against certain cancers. SALL4, a cancer driver, contains seven C2H2 zinc fingers in four clusters, including an IMiD degron in zinc finger cluster two (ZFC2). Surprisingly, IMiDs do not inhibit growth of SALL4 expressing cancer cells. To overcome this limit, we focused on a non-IMiD degron, SALL4 zinc finger cluster four (ZFC4). By combining AlphaFold and the ZFC4-DNA crystal structure, we identified a potential ZFC4 drug pocket. Utilizing an in silico docking algorithm and cell viability assays, we screened chemical libraries and discovered SH6, which selectively targets SALL4-expressing cancer cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that SH6 degrades SALL4 protein through the CUL4A/CRBN pathway, while deletion of ZFC4 abolished this activity. Moreover, SH6 led to significant 62% tumor growth inhibition of SALL4+ xenografts in vivo and demonstrated good bioavailability in pharmacokinetic studies. In summary, these studies represent a new approach for IMiD independent drug discovery targeting C2H2 transcription factors in cancer.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=177 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/574032v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b8e4e8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bc6f01org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11bbe85org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@791cb1_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIntense efforts have focused on identifying heterogeneity of the cellular composition in ovarian cancer. However, tissue composition and physiological conditions of cancer cells in cisplatin-sensitive ovarian cancer remains largely unknown. Moreover, comparisons of different cellular states in normal tissue, in treatment naive ovarian cancer, and in cisplatin-treated tissue after adjuvant therapy of cisplatin-sensitive ovarian cancer at the single-cell level might offer clues for ovarian cancer treatment and prevention of cisplatin-resistance formation.\n\nMethodsSingle-cell transcriptome sequencing of a cisplatin-treated ovarian cancer was performed. Data sets of non-tumorous ovarian tissues and treatment-naive ovarian cancer were downloaded from the European Genome-phenome Archive (accession number EGAS00001004987). Quality control, batch effect correction, integration, and clustering analysis of the integrated single-cell transcriptome data was done. Cell subsets were annotated based on surface marker phenotypes. Finally, the proportions of subclusters, the immune cell population, and the potential biological processes among different cellular states were compared.\n\nResultsSixteen distinct cell subsets were identified from the integrated single-cell transcriptome sequencing data of a pool of all tissues. The composition of the three different tissue types was characterized. The proportion of fibroblasts in cisplatin-treated ovarian tumor was remarkably lower than in treatment-naive ovarian tumor (1.33% vs. 13.53%, p < 0.05). Moreover, each subjects sample had differing relative proportions of the identified cell types. In primary untreated ovarian cancer, the prevalent immune cells were B cells and myeloid-related immunosuppressive M2 macrophages. However, there were less B cells and myeloid-related immunosuppressive M2 macrophages after cisplatin-treatment, while significantly more T cells were found. The physiological cellular state in primary untreated ovarian tumors was associated with dysfunctional gene expression and modulation of cellular homeostasis, while cells from cisplatin-treated tumor showed more activation of immune and inflammatory genes as compared to healthy ovarian tissue.\n\nConclusionOur molecular gene expression analysis allowed for the separation and identification of differences in normal ovarian tissues, treatment-naive, and cisplatin-sensitive ovarian cancer cell populations at single-cell resolution. We identified different cell type composition and discriminative marker expression concerning specific cell subsets and identified differences among their physiological cell states. This knowledge may open new possibilities for elucidating important pathogenetic features and therapeutic strategies for treating ovarian cancer.",

We leveraged a brain-computer interface (BCI) to challenge monkeys to violate the naturally-occurring time courses of neural population activity that we observed in motor cortex. This included challenging animals to traverse the natural time course of neural activity in a time-reversed manner. Animals were unable to violate the natural time courses of neural activity when directly challenged to do so.

Despite the complexity, people adapt rapidly, suggesting neural mechanisms optimized for efficient adaptation.

The actions of one arm can serve as a contextual cue for the other arm for all three timing contexts, facilitating dual adaptation. More importantly, the timing of the learned contextual action plays a pivotal role in the temporal generalization. While motor memories trained with past contextual movements generalize broadly, motor memories trained with future movements exhibit limited generalization, and motor memories trained with simultaneous movements do not generalize to past or future timings. This highlights temporal tuning in sensorimotor plasticity: different training conditions yield substantially different temporal generalization.",

    "abstract": "Cytokine therapies are potent immunotherapy agents but exhibit severe dose-limiting toxicities. One strategy to overcome this involves engineering cytokines for intratumoral retention following local delivery. Here, we develop a localized cytokine therapy that elicits profound anti-tumor immunity by engineered targeting to the ubiquitous leukocyte receptor CD45. We designed CD45-targeted immunocytokines (CD45-Cyt) that, upon injection, decorated the surface of leukocytes in the tumor and tumor-draining lymph node (TDLN) without systemic exposure. CD45-Cyt therapy eradicated both directly treated tumors and untreated distal lesions in multiple syngeneic mouse tumor models. Mechanistically, CD45-Cyt triggered prolonged pSTAT signaling and reprogrammed tumor-specific CD8+ T cells in the TDLN to exhibit an anti-viral transcriptional signature. CD45 anchoring represents a broad platform for protein retention by host immune cells for use in immunotherapy.",

However, existing methods for predicting antibiotic resistance from genomic sequence data have had lim- ited success due to their inability to model epistatic effects and generalize to novel variants. Here, we present GeneBac, a deep learning method for predicting antibiotic resistance from DNA sequence through the integration of interactions between genes. We apply GeneBac to two distinct bacterial species and show that it can successfully predict the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of multiple antibiotics. We use the WHO Mycobacterium tuberculosis mutation cat- alogue to demonstrate that GeneBac accurately predicts the effects of different variants, including novel variants that have not been observed during training. GeneBac is a modular framework which can be applied to a number of tasks including gene expression prediction, resistant gene identification and strain clus- tering. We leverage this modularity to transfer learn from the transcriptomic data to improve performance on the MIC prediction task.",

    "abstract": "Collective behaviors require coordination of individuals. Thus, a population must adjust its phenotypic distribution to adapt to changing environments. How can a population regulate its phenotypic distribution? One strategy is to utilize specialized networks for gene regulation and maintaining distinct phenotypic subsets. Another involves genetic mutations, which can be augmented by stress-response pathways. Here, we studied how a migrating bacterial population regulates its phenotypic distribution to traverse across diverse environments. We generated isogenic Escherichia coli populations with varying distributions of swimming behaviors and observed their phenotype distributions during migration in liquid and porous environments. Surprisingly, we found that during collective migration, the distributions of swimming phenotypes adapt to the environment without mutations or gene regulation. Instead, adaptation is caused by the dynamic and reversible enrichment of high-performing swimming phenotypes within each environment. This adaptation mechanism is supported by a recent theoretical study, which proposed that the phenotypic composition of a migrating population results from a balance between cell growth generating diversity and collective migration eliminating the phenotypes that are unable to keep up with the migrating group. Furthermore, by examining chemoreceptor abundance distributions during migration towards different attractants, we found that this mechanism acts on multiple chemotaxis-related traits simultaneously. Our findings reveal that collective migration itself can enable cell populations with continuous, multi-dimensional phenotypes to flexibly and rapidly adapt their phenotypic composition to diverse environmental conditions.\n\nSignificance statementConventional cell adaptation mechanisms, like gene regulation and random phenotypic switching, act swiftly but are limited to a few traits, while mutation-driven adaptations unfold slowly. By quantifying phenotypic diversity during bacterial collective migration, we discovered an adaptation mechanism that rapidly and reversibly adjusts multiple traits simultaneously. By dynamically balancing the elimination of phenotypes unable to keep pace with generation of diversity through growth, this process enables populations to tune their phenotypic composition based on the environment, without the need for gene regulation or mutations. Given the prevalence of collective migration in microbes, cancers, and embryonic development, non-genetic adaptation through collective migration may be a universal mechanism for populations to navigate diverse environments, offering insights into broader applications across various fields.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how detection probability varies over time, space, or in response to measurable covariates is important to inform the monitoring and assessment of many species. A standard model to understand detectability - the availability/perception model - admits that detection probability is the composite of two components: availability and perception. Availability is largely affected by environmental and behavioral factors, whereas perception is primarily affected by attributes of individual observers and survey protocols, and thus can potentially be partially controlled by survey design. We designed and implemented a field study to understand the perception component of detection for Eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina carolina) using visual encounter surveys. We obtained and deployed museum specimens of Eastern box turtle shells and subjected them to visual search surveys by observers in realistic field situations. Overall, about 50% of the box turtle shells were detected by observers including, 41.5% in the  partially visible state and 63% in the  fully visible state. There were significant differences among observers, which may be due to observer-specific variation in search technique -- the observers varied in how well they achieved the protocol guidance.",

Here, we collect and integrate multi-omics data, including 581 RNA-seq, 54 ATAC-seq, 45 ChIP-seq, and 69 single-cell RNA-seq samples from different stages of human PGC development to recapitulate the precisely controlled and stepwise process, presenting an atlas in the human PGC database (hPGCdb). With these uniformly processed data and integrated analyses, we characterize the potential key transcription factors and regulatory networks governing human germ cell fate. We validate the important roles of some of the key factors in germ cell development by CRISPRi knockdown. We also identify the soma-germline interaction network and discover the involvement of SDC2 and LAMA4 for PGC development, as well as soma-derived NOTCH2 signaling for germ cell differentiation.

    "abstract": "Aberrant alternative splicing is well-known to be closely associated with tumorigenesis of various cancers. However, the intricate mechanisms underlying breast cancer metastasis driven by deregulated splicing events remain largely unexplored. Here, we unveiled RBM7 as a novel regulator of alternative splicing that plays a crucial role in counteracting the metastatic potential of breast cancer. Through bioinformatics analysis and IHC staining validation, we revealed that RBM7 is decreased in lymph node and distant organ metastases of breast cancer as compared to primary lesions. Furthermore, we found that low expression of RBM7 is correlated with the reduced disease-free survival of breast cancer patients. Breast cancer cells with RBM7 depletion exhibited an increased potential for lung metastasis compared to scramble control cells. The absence of RBM7 stimulated breast cancer cell migration, invasion, and angiogenesis. Mechanistically, RBM7 regulates the splicing of MFGE8 directly, favoring the production of the predominant MFGE8-L isoform. This results in the attenuation of STAT1 phosphorylation and alterations in cell adhesion molecules. The MFGE8-L isoform exerted an inhibitory effect on the migratory and invasive capability of breast cancer cells, while the MFGE8-S isoform had the opposite effect. Particularly, the ectopic expression of MFGE8-L significantly reversed the pro-invasion effect of RBM7 silencing, but did not contribute to the promotion of angiogenesis-related secreted proteins. In RBM7 depleted cells, a gene set enrichment analysis revealed a significant amplification of the NF-{kappa}B cascade. Concordantly, RBM7 negatively regulates p65 phosphorylation. Furthermore, an NF-{kappa}B inhibitor could obstruct the increase in HUVEC tube formation caused by RBM7 silencing. Clinically, we noticed a positive correlation between RBM7 expression, MFGE-8 exon7 inclusion, and p65 downstream targets. Therefore, our study not only offer mechanistic insights into how abnormal splicing contributes to the aggressiveness of breast cancer, but also provide a new approach for molecular-targeted therapy in combating breast cancer.",

The lack of model systems to study airborne pathogens limits the understanding of airborne pathogen distribution, as well as potential surveillance and mitigation strategies. In this work, we develop a novel model system to study airborne pathogens using virus like particles (VLP). Specifically, we demonstrate the ability to aerosolize VLP and detect and quantify aerosolized VLP RNA by Reverse Transcription-Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) in real-time fluorescent and colorimetric assays. Importantly, the VLP model presents many advantages for the study of airborne viral pathogens: (i) similarity in size and surface components; (ii) ease of generation and noninfectious nature enabling study of BSL3 and BSL4 viruses; (iii) facile characterization of aerosolization parameters; (iv) ability to adapt the system to other viral envelope proteins including those of newly discovered pathogens and mutant variants; (v) the ability to introduce viral sequences to develop nucleic acid amplification assays.\n\nImportanceStudy and detection of airborne pathogens is hampered by the lack of appropriate model systems. In this work we demonstrate that noninfectious Virus Like Particles (VLP) represent attractive models to study airborne viral pathogens.

    "abstract": "BackgroundDuring the current COVID-19 pandemic, the rate of morbidity and mortality was considerably lower in BCG vaccinated countries like Pakistan. BCG has been shown to provide cross protection to both disseminated TB as well as non related viral infections in BCG vaccinated children which is consistent with COVID-19 morbidity in the younger age group. Recently, this cross protection was attributed to trained immunity (TI) associated with BCG recall responses in the innate arm of the immune system. Little is known about the longevity of BCG Trained Immunity (TI) beyond early childhood.\n\nObjectiveTo assess the BCG-induced recall responses in healthy individuals by cytokines secreted from the TI network and its potential role in providing cross-protection against COVID-19 and other viral infections.\n\nStudy DesignIn this cross-sectional study, healthy young adults and adolescents (n=20) were recruited from 16-40 years of age, with no prior history of TB treatment, autoimmune, or chronic inflammatory condition.\n\nMethodsBCG-induced cytokine responses were assessed using prototypic markers for cells of the TI network {macrophages [M1 (TNF, IFN{gamma}), M2 (IL10)], NK (IL2), Gamma delta ({gamma}{delta}) T (IL17, IL4)} and SARS CoV2 IgG antibodies against RBD using short-term (12 hrs.) cultures assay.\n\nResultsSignificant differences were observed in the magnitude of recall responses to BCG with macrophage cytokines showing the highest mean levels of TNF (9148 pg/ml) followed by IL10 (488 pg/ml) and IFN{gamma} (355 pg/ml). The ratio of unstimulated vs.BCG-stimulated cytokines was 132 fold higher for TNF, 40 fold for IL10, and 27 fold for IFN{gamma}. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were also detected in unstimulated plasma which showed cross reactivity with BCG.\n\nConclusionThe presence of cross reactive antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and the relative ratio of pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines secreted by activated TI cellular network may play a pivotal role in protection in the early stages of infection as observed during the COVID-19 pandemic in the younger age groups resulting in lower morbidity and mortality.",

    "abstract": "Primarily a respiratory infection, numerous patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 present with neurologic symptoms, some continuing long after viral clearance as a persistent symptomatic phase termed \"long COVID\". Advanced age increases the risk of severe disease, as well as incidence of long COVID. We hypothesized that perturbations in the aged immune response predispose elderly individuals to severe coronavirus infection and post-infectious sequelae. Using a murine model of respiratory coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59), we found that aging increased clinical illness and lethality to MHV infection, with aged animals harboring increased virus in the brain during acute infection. This was coupled with an unexpected increase in activated CD8+ T cells within the brains of aged animals but reduced antigen specificity of those CD8+ T cells. Aged animals demonstrated spatial learning impairment following MHV infection, which correlated with increased neuronal cell death and reduced neuronal regeneration in aged hippocampus. Using primary cell culture, we demonstrated that activated CD8+ T cells induce neuronal death, independent of antigen-specificity. Specifically, higher levels of CD8+ T cell-derived IFN-{gamma} correlated with neuronal death. These results support the evidence that CD8+ T cells in the brain directly contribute to cognitive dysfunction following coronavirus infection in aged individuals.\n\neTOC summaryUsing a murine model of respiratory coronavirus infection, we show that aging amplifies post-infectious cognitive dysfunction due to activated CD8+ T cells that secrete IFN-{gamma} in the brain.

These inputs trigger synaptic changes which are purported to drive progressive adjustment of future movements. Individually, binary complex spike signals lack information about the sign and magnitude of errors which presents a problem for cerebellar learning paradigms exhibiting fast adaptation. Using a newly developed behavioral paradigm in mice, we introduced sensorimotor perturbations into a simple joystick pulling behavior and found parasagittal bands of Purkinje cells with reciprocal modulation of complex spike activity. Whereas complex spiking showed little modulation in the unperturbed condition, alternating bands were activated or inhibited when the perturbation was introduced, and this modulation encoded the sign and magnitude of the resulting sensorimotor mismatch. These findings provide an important piece of information for the understanding of cerebellar learning that helps to explain how the cerebellum could use supervised learning to quickly adapt motor behavior in response to perturbations.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryPopulations of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum facilitate trial-by-trial movement refinement by converting binary signals from movement errors into graded signals that encode the errors direction and magnitude.",

Several members of this family, such as galectin-1, exhibit both cell-surface and intracellular functions. Interestingly, galectin-1 can be found in the endomembrane system, nucleus, or cytosol, as well as on the cell surface. The mechanisms by which galectin-1 traffics between cellular compartments, including its unconventional secretion and internalization processes, are poorly understood. Here, we determined the pathways by which exogenous galectin-1 enters cells and explored its capacity as a delivery vehicle for protein and siRNA therapeutics. We used a galectin-1-toxin conjugate, modelled on antibody-drug conjugates, as a selection tool in a genome-wide CRISPR screen. We discovered that galectin-1 interacts with the endosome-lysosome trafficking receptor sortilin in a glycan-dependent manner, which regulates galectin-1 trafficking to the lysosome. Further, we show that this pathway can be exploited for delivery of a functional siRNA. This study sheds light on the mechanisms by which galectin-1 is internalized by cells and suggests a new strategy for intracellular drug delivery via galectin-1 conjugation.",

    "abstract": "Chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla transduce sympathetic nerve activity into stress hormone secretion. The two neurotransmitters principally responsible for coupling cell stimulation to secretion are acetylcholine and pituitary adenylate activating polypeptide (PACAP). In contrast to acetylcholine, PACAP evokes a persistent secretory response from chromaffin cells. However, the mechanisms by which PACAP acts are poorly understood. Here, it is shown that PACAP induces sustained increases in cytosolic Ca2+ which are disrupted when Ca2+ influx through L-type channels is blocked or internal Ca2+ stores are depleted. PACAP liberates stored Ca2+ via inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thereby functionally coupling Ca2+ mobilization to Ca2+ influx and supporting Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release. These Ca2+ influx and mobilization pathways are unified by an absolute dependence on phospholipase C epsilon (PLC{varepsilon}) activity. Thus, the persistent secretory response that is a defining feature of PACAP activity, in situ, is regulated by a signaling network that promotes sustained elevations in intracellular Ca2+ through multiple pathways.",

    "abstract": "Activated GPCRs are phosphorylated and internalized mostly via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), which are then sorted for recycling or degradation. We investigated how differential activation of the same GPCR affects its endocytic trafficking in vivo using rhodopsin as a model in flies expressing mCherry-tagged rhodopsin 1 (Rh1-mC) or GFP-tagged arrestin 1 (Arr1-GFP). Upon blue light stimulation, activated Rh1 recruited Arr1-GFP to the rhabdomere, which became co-internalized and accumulated in cytoplasmic vesicles of photoreceptors. This internalization was eliminated in shits1mutants affecting dynamin. Moreover, it was blocked by either rdgA or rdgB mutations affecting the PIP2 biosynthesis. Together, the blue light-initiated internalization of Rh1 and Arr1 belongs to CME. Green light stimulation also triggered the internalization and accumulation of activated Rh1-mC in the cytoplasm but with faster kinetics. Importantly, Arr1-GFP was also recruited to the rhabdomere but not co-internalized with Rh1-mC. This endocytosis was not affected in shits1 nor rdgA mutants, indicating it is not CME. We explored the fate of internalized Rh1-mC following CME and observed it remained in cytoplasmic vesicles following 30 min of dark adaptation. In contrast, in the non-CME Rh1-mC appeared readily recycled back to the rhabdomere within five min of dark treatment. This faster recycling may be regulated by rhodopsin phosphatase, RdgC. Together, we demonstrate two distinct endocytic and recycling mechanisms of Rh1 via two light stimulations. It appears that each stimulation triggers a distinct conformation leading to different phosphorylation patterns of Rh1 capable of recruiting Arr1 to rhabdomeres. However, a more stable interaction leads to the co-internalization of Arr1 that orchestrates CME. A stronger Arr1 association appears to impede the recycling of the phosphorylated Rh1 by preventing the recruitment of RdgC. We conclude that conformations of activated rhodopsin determine the downstream outputs upon phosphorylation that confers differential protein-protein interactions.",
