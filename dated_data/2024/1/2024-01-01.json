    "abstract": "Primary vestibular afferents transmit information from hair cells about head position and movement to the CNS, which is critical for maintaining balance, gaze stability and spatial navigation. The CNS, in turn, modulates hair cells and afferents via the efferent vestibular system (EVS) and its activation of several cholinergic signaling mechanisms. Electrical stimulation of EVS neurons gives rise to three kinetically- and mechanistically-distinct afferent responses including a slow excitation, a fast excitation, and a fast inhibition. EVS-mediated slow excitation is attributed to odd-numbered muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) on the afferent whose activation leads to the closure of a potassium conductance and increased afferent discharge.\n\nLikely effector candidates include low-threshold, voltage-gated potassium channels belonging to the KCNQ (Kv7.X) family, which are involved in neuronal excitability across the nervous system and are subject to mAChR modulation. Specifically, KCNQ2/3 heteromeric channels may be the molecular correlates for the M-current, a potassium current that is blocked following the activation of odd-numbered mAChRs. To this end, multiple members of the KCNQ channel family, including KCNQ2 and KCNQ3, are localized to several microdomains within vestibular afferent endings, where they influence afferent excitability and could be targeted by EVS neurons. Additionally, the relative expression of KCNQ subunits appears to vary across the sensory epithelia and among different afferent types. However, it is unclear which KCNQ channel subunits are targeted by mAChR activation and whether that also varies among different afferent classes. Here we show that EVS-mediated slow excitation is blocked and enhanced by the non-selective KCNQ channel blocker XE991 and opener retigabine, respectively. Using KCNQ subunit-selective drugs, we observed that a KCNQ2 blocker blocks the slow response in irregular afferents, while a KCNQ2/3 opener enhances slow responses in regular afferents. The KCNQ2 blockers did not appear to affect resting afferent discharge rates, while KCNQ2/3 or KCNQ2/4 openers decreased afferent excitability. Here, we show pharmacological evidence that KCNQ2/3 subunits are likely targeted by mAChR activation in mammalian vestibular afferents. Additionally, we show that KCNQ3 KO mice have altered resting discharge rate as well as EVS-mediated slow response. These data together suggest that KCNQ channels play a role in slow response and discharge rate of vestibular afferents, which can be modulated by EVS in mammals.",

    "abstract": "The sense of smell is tightly linked to emotions, a link that is thought to rely on the direct synaptic connections between the olfactory bulb and nuclei of the amygdala. A small number of amygdaloid nuclei are the recipients of such direct input from the olfactory bulb and their unique functions are not known. Among them, the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract (NLOT) is unique in its developmental history and gene expression. NLOT has been very little studied and consequentially its function is unknown. Furthermore, formulation of informed hypotheses about NLOT function is at this stage limited by the lack of knowledge about its connectivity and physiological properties. Here, we used pseudo-rabies tracing methods to systematically reveal monosynaptic inputs into NLOT, and adeno-associated viruses to reveal NLOT projection targets. We found that the NLOT is interconnected with several olfactory brain regions and with the basolateral amygdala. Some of these connections were reciprocal, and some showed unique interhemispheric patterns. We tested the excitable properties of NLOT neurons and the properties of each of the major synaptic inputs. We found that the NLOT receives powerful input from piriform cortex, tenia tecta, and the basolateral amygdala, but only very weak input from the olfactory bulb. When input crosses threshold, NLOT neurons respond with calcium-dependent bursts of action potentials. This integration of olfactory and amygdalar inputs suggests that NLOT plays a role in behaviors that combine smell and emotion, possibly assigning emotional value to odors.\n\nSignificance statementDespite the well-known functional links between olfaction and emotions, the physiological properties of these links remain largely understudied. One major pathway by which olfactory and emotional signals interact, is via the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract (NLOT). NLOT has been little studied and its function is yet unclear. The lack of physiological information hinders informed hypotheses. Here, we characterize the synaptic and intrinsic properties of NLOT neurons. We show that the NLOT receives converging olfactory and amygdalar inputs, and that NLOT neurons respond to input with high-rate bursts of action potentials. This suggests that the NLOT, that harbors [~]2500 cells, encodes a low-dimensional signal that is of high importance. We hypothesize that the NLOT assigns emotional value to odors.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe genes involved in inner ear development and maintenance of the adult organ have yet to be fully characterized. Previous genetic analysis has emphasized the early development that gives rise to the otic vesicle. This study aimed to bridge the knowledge gap and identify candidate genes that are expressed as the auditory and vestibular sensory organs continue to grow and develop until the systems reach postmetamorphic maturity.\n\nMethodsAffymetrix microarrays were used to assess inner ear transcriptome profiles from three Xenopus laevis developmental ages where all eight endorgans comprise mechanosensory hair cells: larval stages 50 and 56, and the post-metamorphic juvenile. Pairwise comparisons were made between the three developmental stages and the resulting differentially expressed X. laevis Probe Set IDs (Xl-PSIDs) were assigned to four groups based on differential expression patterns. DAVID analysis was undertaken to impart functional annotation to the differentially regulated Xl-PSIDs.\n\nResultsAnalysis identified 1510 candidate genes for differential gene expression in one or more pairwise comparison. Annotated genes not previously associated with inner ear development emerged from this analysis, as well as annotated genes with established inner ear function, such as oncomodulin, neurod1, and sp7. Notably, 36% of differentially expressed Xl-PSIDs were unannotated.\n\nConclusionsResults draw attention to the complex gene regulatory patterns that characterize Xenopus inner ear development, and underscore the need for improved annotation of the X. laevis genome. Outcomes can be utilized to select candidate inner ear genes for functional analysis, and to promote Xenopus as a model organism for biomedical studies of hearing and balance.",

    "abstract": "A connection between stress-related illnesses and alcohol use disorders is extensively documented. Fear conditioning is a standard procedure used to study stress learning and links it to the activation of amygdala circuitry. However, the connection between the changes in amygdala circuit and function induced by alcohol and fear conditioning is not well established. We introduce a computational model to test the mechanistic relationship between amygdala functional and circuit adaptations during fear conditioning and the impact of acute vs. repeated alcohol exposure. In accordance with experiments, both acute and prior repeated alcohol decreases speed and robustness of fear extinction in our simulations. The model predicts that, first, the delay in fear extinction in alcohol is mostly induced by greater activation of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) after fear acquisition due to alcohol-induced modulation of synaptic weights. Second, both acute and prior repeated alcohol shifts the amygdala network away from the robust extinction regime by inhibiting the activity in the central amygdala (CeA). Third, our model predicts that fear memories formed in acute or after chronic alcohol are more connected to the context. Thus, the model suggests how circuit changes induced by alcohol may affect fear behaviors and provides a framework for investigating the involvement of multiple neuromodulators in this neuroadaptive process.",

    "abstract": "The red nucleus is a large brainstem structure that coordinates limb movement for locomotion in quadrupedal animals (Basile et al., 2021). The humans red nucleus has a different pattern of anatomical connectivity compared to quadrupeds, suggesting a unique purpose (Hatschek, 1907). Previously the function of the human red nucleus remained unclear at least partly due to methodological limitations with brainstem functional neuroimaging (Sclocco et al., 2018). Here, we used our most advanced resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) based precision functional mapping (PFM) in highly sampled individuals (n = 5) and large group-averaged datasets (combined N [~] 45,000), to precisely examine red nucleus functional connectivity.\n\nNotably, red nucleus functional connectivity to motor-effector networks (somatomotor hand, foot, and mouth) was minimal. Instead, red nucleus functional connectivity along the central sulcus was specific to regions of the recently discovered somato-cognitive action network (SCAN; (Gordon et al., 2023)). Outside of primary motor cortex, red nucleus connectivity was strongest to the cingulo-opercular (CON) and salience networks, involved in action/cognitive control (Dosenbach et al., 2007; Newbold et al., 2021) and reward/motivated behavior (Seeley, 2019), respectively. Functional connectivity to these two networks was organized into discrete dorsal-medial and ventral-lateral zones. Red nucleus functional connectivity to the thalamus recapitulated known structural connectivity of the dento-rubral thalamic tract (DRTT) and could prove clinically useful in functionally targeting the ventral intermediate (VIM) nucleus. In total, our results indicate that far from being a  motor structure, the red nucleus is better understood as a brainstem nucleus for implementing goal-directed behavior, integrating behavioral valence and action plans.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance poses a global health crisis, limiting the efficacy of available therapeutic agents and hindering the development of new antibiotics. The pharmaceutical industrys waning interest in antibiotic production further exacerbates this challenge. Addressing antibiotic resistance demands innovative solutions. Here, we explore the application of CRISPR-Cas-based antimicrobials as a pioneering approach to combat multidrug resistance. Our study focuses on the methicillin-resistant clinical Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a significant clinical threat. Utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we aimed to concurrently target methicillin (mecA), gentamicin (aacA), and ciprofloxacin (grlA, grlB) resistance genes, thereby altering the resistance profile and enhancing sensitivity to antibiotics. We engineered CRISPR plasmids containing sgRNAs specific to the target regions, which were subsequently electroporated into MRSA strains. Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assessed changes in resistance gene expression, while disk diffusion and broth microdilution methods determined alterations in resistance status. Western blotting analyzed changes in PBP2a expression, and Sanger sequence analysis confirmed mutations in target regions. Results revealed a statistically significant 1.5-fold decrease in mecA gene expression, 5.5-fold decrease in grlA gene, 6-fold decrease in grlB gene, and 4-fold decrease in aacA gene compared to the wild type strain, as determined by RT-PCR. Antibiotic susceptibility tests demonstrated the suppression of mecA, grlA, grlB, and aacA genes, resulting in the reversal of resistance to beta-lactam, quinolone, and aminoglycoside antibiotics. Western blot analysis showed 70% decrease in PBP2a expression, indicating the breakdown of beta-lactam resistance. Sanger sequence analysis confirmed point mutations in grlB and aacA genes, along with three-base mutations in grlA and mecA genes. Our findings underscore the potential of CRISPR/Cas9 technology to mitigate antibiotic resistance, offering a transformative strategy to restore the efficacy of existing antibiotics in the face of multidrug-resistant pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of the diarrheal disease cholera, poses an ongoing health threat due to its wide repertoire of horizontally acquired elements (HAEs) and virulence factors. New clinical isolates of the bacterium with improved fitness abilities, often associated with HAEs, frequently emerge. The appropriate control and expression of such genetic elements is critical for the bacteria to thrive in the different environmental niches it occupies. H-NS, the histone-like nucleoid structuring protein, is the best studied xenogeneic silencer of HAEs in gamma-proteobacteria. Although H-NS and other highly abundant nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) have been shown to play important roles in regulating HAEs and virulence in model bacteria, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of how different NAPs modulate transcription in V. cholerae. By obtaining genome-wide measurements of protein occupancy and active transcription in a clinical isolate of V. cholerae, harboring recently discovered HAEs encoding for phage defense systems, we show that a lack of H-NS causes a robust increase in the expression of genes found in many HAEs. We further found that TsrA, a protein with partial homology to H-NS, regulates virulence genes primarily through modulation of H-NS activity. We also identified a few sites that are affected by TsrA independently of H-NS, suggesting TsrA may act with diverse regulatory mechanisms. Our results demonstrate how the combinatorial activity of NAPs is employed by a clinical isolate of an important pathogen to regulate recently discovered HAEs.\n\nImportanceNew strains of the bacterial pathogen Vibrio cholerae, bearing novel horizontally acquired elements (HAEs), frequently emerge. HAEs provide beneficial traits to the bacterium, such as antibiotic resistance and defense against invading bacteriophages. Xenogeneic silencers are proteins that help bacteria harness new HAEs and silence those HAEs until they are needed. H-NS is the best-studied xenogeneic silencer; it is one of the nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) in gamma-proteobacteria and is responsible for the proper regulation of HAEs within the bacterial transcriptional network. We studied the effects of H-NS and other NAPs on the HAEs of a clinical isolate of V. cholerae. Importantly, we found that H-NS partners with a small and poorly characterized protein, TsrA, to help domesticate new HAEs involved in bacterial survival and in causing disease. Proper understanding of the regulatory state in emerging isolates of V. cholerae will provide improved therapies against new isolates of the pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Renowned for their role in hemostasis and thrombosis, platelets are also increasingly recognized for their contribution in innate immunity, immunothrombosis and inflammatory diseases. Platelets express a wide range of receptors, which allows them to reach a variety of activation endpoints and grants them immunomodulatory functions. Activated platelets release extracellular vesicles (PEVs), whose formation and molecular cargo has been shown to depend on receptor-mediated activation and environmental cues.\n\nThis study compares the immunomodulatory profiles of PEVs generated via activation of platelets by different receptors, glycoprotein VI, C-type lectin-like receptor 2, and combining all thrombin-collagen receptors. Functional assays in vivo in zebrafish and in vitro in human macrophages respectively highlighted distinct homing and secretory responses triggered by the PEVs. In contrast, omics analyses of protein and miRNA cargo combined with physicochemical particle characterization found only subtle differences between the PEV types, which were insufficient to explain their different functional immunomodulatory profiles. Constitutively released PEVs, formed in the absence of an exogenous activator, displayed a disparate activation profile from the receptor induced PEVs.\n\nOur findings underscore that PEVs are tunable through receptor-mediated activation. To truly comprehend their role(s) in mediating platelet functions among immune cells, conducting functional assays is imperative.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=140 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/570750v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (53K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@75a9dborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e2787corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@543525org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6d1362_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The vertebrate body forms by progressive addition and segmentation of tissues in an anterior to posterior direction. The posterior presomitic mesoderm (pPSM), which receives new cells from the tailbud, produces an expansive force that drives axis elongation1-3. Elongation moves an FGF gradient that controls the boundary placement of new segments in conjunction with the oscillatory genes of the segmentation clock4. As the period of the segmentation clock is insensitive to body size5,6 or elongation progress7,8, the number and size consistency of segments depend on stable, robust elongation. How elongation speed is constrained remains unknown. Here we utilised modeling and tissue force microscopy9 on chicken embryos to show that cell density of the pPSM dynamically modulates elongation speed in a negative feedback loop. Elongation alters the cell density in the pPSM, which in turn controls progenitor cell influx through the mechanical coupling of body axis tissues. This enables responsive cell dynamics in over- and under-elongated axes that consequently self-adjust speed to achieve long-term robustness in axial length. Our simulations and experiments further suggest that cell density and activity under FGF signalling act synergistically to drive elongation. Our work supports a simple mechanism of morphogenetic speed control where the cell density relates negatively to progress, and positively to force generation.",

    "abstract": "During embryogenesis, the cells in an embryo need to make numerous spatiotemporal decisions. However, there is inherent noise in each decision due to genetic or environmental fluctuations. How to suppress the noise accumulation to achieve stable embryonic end-products, a process known as Waddingtons developmental canalization, has been a major puzzle in biology since the 1940s. Previous studies have focused on the molecular noise within a cell instead of the cell noise within an embryo, thus providing indirect understandings (e,g., the well-known genetic capacitor Hsp90). In this study, we applied time-lapse microscopic imaging to capturing the spatiotemporal features of single cells, including cell position and cell cycle length, during the embryogenesis of approximately 2,100 Caenorhabditis elegans embryos exposed to various genetic or environmental perturbations. By treating the deviation of a cells spatiotemporal feature from the expected value as noise, we modeled the transmission of noise from each mother cell to their daughters. We discovered pervasive mother-daughter negative feedbacks, which collectively constitute continuous and comprehensive  canals for suppressing noise accumulation along the developmental cell lineages, with the steepness (measuring noise suppression efficacy) and depth (measuring noise tolerance level) of the canals quantitatively defined. The learned quantitative rules enabled us to develop a cell-noise-based model that accurately predicts the nematode hatching phenotype, revealing how embryonic stochasticity could cause phenotypic disparity. With a high-dimensional mathematical tool we then proved the system stability of embryogenesis against the cell spatiotemporal noise. We also revealed several dozen canal-maintaining genes and proposed a novel association study framework that links embryonic cells rather than genetic variants with organismal traits. In sum, this study discovered and quantitatively characterized the developmental canals that directly stabilize embryogenesis in a metazoan, illuminating an 80-year-old puzzle and paving a way for studying the phenotypic plasticity and robustness of multicellular organisms from the perspective of embryogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The impacts of fragmentation are often overlooked in landscape studies investigating how habitat loss impacts biodiversity, despite the casual relationship linking both processes. As habitat loss is the primary cause of fragmentation, understanding the inter-related effects of these twin processes on biodiversity is key to minimise biodiversity loss. Here we assess how habitat amount and configuration influence insectivorous bat assemblages, considering both the direct effects of these processes, as well as the indirect effects of habitat amount mediated through configuration. Bats were acoustically surveyed along independent gradients of habitat amount (forest cover) and configuration (number of patches and edge density) across 28 insular landscapes embedded within a Malaysian hydroelectric reservoir. Using Structural Equation Modelling, the direct and indirect effects of habitat amount were examined on bat sonotype richness, total, and guild-specific activity (forest, edge and open-space foragers). Forest cover had a direct and positive effect on sonotype richness and forest forager activity. The quadratic relationship linking edge density and forest cover was strong and overall positive, but while below 30% of forest cover, increasingly forested landscapes had increasingly high edge densities, the opposite pattern was observed in more forested landscapes. On the other hand, increasingly forested landscapes consistently harboured less patches. Owing to the overall low habitat amount in our landscapes and negative edge effects, the indirect effects of forest cover (mediated through edge density) were therefore negative on sonotype richness, outweighing any positive direct effect. The number of patches had little effect on the bat assemblage, except on total activity which was higher in landscapes harbouring more forest patches. As a result, negative indirect effects of forest cover mediated through number of patches were only observed on total activity. Our results highlight that, in natural settings, habitat amount can hardly be altered without influencing habitat configuration, thereby preventing any independent management of these threats. Minimising habitat loss is therefore essential to balance the associated prevailing negative effects of fragmentation on insectivorous bats across tropical forests.",

    "abstract": "Losing or regressing traits has occurred repeatedly throughout evolutionary history in response to changing living environments. In parasitoid wasps, a mega-diverse group of insects in Hymenoptera, the loss or reduction of yolk in eggs has been reported in numerous species, and this phenotypic change is likely to have evolved as a response to the shift from ectoparasitism to endoparasitism. However, the genetic basis of this trait loss and the impact of trait loss on genome evolution are still poorly understood. Here, we perform comparative genomic analysis of 64 hymenopteran insects, and observe that a conserved insect yolk protein gene vitellogenin (Vg) was repeatedly lost in 23 endoparasitoids, representing five independent loss events in five families. Whole genome alignments suggest the loss of Vgs was probably associated with genome rearrangements. We also discover the gene losses, relaxed selection, and protein structural variations of Vg receptor genes (VgRs) in the Vg loss lineages, showing the obviously functional biased patterns of gene loss. Our hypothesis test further reveals that the ecto-to-endo transition is not the main reason for the Vg losses and the subsequent evolution of VgRs. In addition, we find a number of parallel and convergent genomic changes including gene family evolution and gene selection related to transport, development, and metabolism in the independent Vg loss lineages. And these changes may have facilitated the embryonic development in these lineages. Together, our findings uncover the genomic basis of a unique trait loss in parasitoid wasps. More broadly, our study enhances our understanding of yolk loss evolution outside mammals, highlighting a potential evolutionary trend when an alternative nutrient source is available for the embryonic development.",

    "abstract": "Microsporidia are parasites with the smallest known eukaryotic genomes. The extent of protein loss in these organisms has been well documented, but much less is known about how compaction of microsporidia proteins affects their function. Taking a comparative genomic approach, we identified microsporidia orthologs of budding yeast proteins and show that these orthologs are enriched for essential yeast genes. We show that the median microsporidia protein is 21% shorter than its yeast counterpart and although extensive protein loss occurred after the divergence of microsporidia, reduced protein sizes were already present in microsporidian relatives. Microsporidia proteins are shorter through reduced domain lengths, diminished linker lengths, and domain loss, with 21% of microsporidia orthologs having lost domains present in yeast. On average, 34% of microsporidia orthologs have lost C-terminal residues essential for function in yeast, including 13 essential domains lost per genome. We also found that microsporidia display distinct phylogenetic patterns of domain loss, with losses occurring in a clade-specific manner. To investigate conservation of function, we used yeast complementation assays to test orthologs from several microsporidia species and their relative Rozella allomycis. These experiments reveal that most microsporidia proteins cannot complement their yeast orthologs, the ability to complement is about three-fold less than observed for R. allomycis orthologs, and proteins that do not complement are more reduced in length than their yeast orthologs. Altogether, our results demonstrate the drastic reduction of microsporidia proteins and show that these reductions have resulted in functional divergence from their fungal ancestors.",

Fish of the central American genus Xiphophorus were proposed to have evolved with multiple ancient and ongoing hybridization events, and served as a valuable research model in evolutionary biology and in biomedical research on human disease for more than a century. Here, we provide the complete genome resource and its annotation of all 26 Xiphophorus species. On this dataset we resolved the so far conflicting phylogeny. Through comparative genomic analyses we investigated the molecular evolution of genes related to melanoma, for a main sexually selected trait and for the genetic control of puberty timing, which are predicted to be involved in pre-and postzygotic isolation and thus to influence the probability of interspecific hybridization in Xiphophorus. We demonstrate dramatic size-variation of some gene families across species, despite the reticulate evolution and short divergence time. Finally, we clarify the hybridization history in the genus Xiphophorus genus, settle the long dispute on the hybridization origin of two Southern swordtails, highlight hybridizations precedes speciation, and reveal the distribution of hybridization ancestry remaining in the fused genome.",

We show that labelled DOs do not undergo detectable structural degradation in cell culture media or human cell extracts for 24 hr. To deliver DO platforms into the nuclei of human U2OS cells, we conjugated 30 nm long DO nanorods with an antibody raised against the largest subunit of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II), a key enzyme involved in gene transcription. We find that DOs remain structurally intact in cells for 24hr, including within the nucleus. Using fluorescence microscopy we demonstrate that the electroporated anti-Pol II antibody conjugated DOs are efficiently piggybacked into nuclei and exihibit sub-diffusive motion inside the nucleus.

    "abstract": "Ischemic stroke is a sudden and acute disease characterized by neuronal death, glia activation, and a severe inflammatory process. Neuroinflammation is an early event after cerebral ischemia, with microglia playing a leading role. Microglial activation involves functional and morphological changes that drive a wide variety of phenotypes. In this context, deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying such microglial activation is essential to devise strategies to protect neurons and maintain certain brain functions affected by early neuroinflammation after ischemia.\n\nHere, we studied the role of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity in the microglial response using a murine model of cerebral ischemia in the acute phase. We also determined the therapeutic relevance of the pharmacological administration of rapamycin, a mTOR inhibitor, before and after ischemic injury.\n\nOur data show that rapamycin, administered before or after brain ischemia induction, reduced the volume of brain damage and neuronal loss by attenuating the microglial response. Therefore, our findings indicate that the pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 in the acute phase of ischemia may provide an alternative strategy to reduce neuronal damage through attenuation of the associated neuroinflammation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTranscranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that has gained prominence recently. Clinical studies have explored tDCS as an adjunct to neurologic disease rehabilitation, with evidence suggesting its potential in modulating brain clearance mechanisms. The glymphatic system, a proposed brain waste clearance system, posits that cerebrospinal fluid-interstitial fluid (CSF-ISF) exchange aids in efficient metabolic waste removal. While some studies have linked tDCS to astrocytes inositol trisphosphate (IP3)/Ca2+ signaling, the impact of tDCS on CSF-ISF exchange dynamics remains unclear.\n\nHypothesistDCS influences the dynamics of CSF-ISF exchange through astrocytic IP3/Ca2+ signaling.\n\nMethodsIn this study, we administered tDCS (0.1mA for 10 minutes) to C57BL/6 mice anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine (KX). The anode was positioned on the cranial bone above the cortex, and the cathode was inserted into the neck. Following tDCS, we directly assessed brain fluid dynamics by injecting biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) as a CSF tracer into the cisterna magna (CM). The brain was then extracted after either 30 or 60 minutes and fixed. After 24 hours, the sectioned brain slices were stained with Alexa 594-conjugated streptavidin (SA) to visualize BDA using immunohistochemistry. We conducted Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings and aquaporin 4 (AQP4)/CD31 immunostaining to investigate the underlying mechanisms of tDCS. Additionally, we monitored the efflux of Evans blue, injected into the cisterna magna, using cervical lymph node imaging. The experiments were subsequently repeated with inositol trisphosphate receptor type 2 (IP3R2)-knockout mice.\n\nResultsPost-tDCS, we observed an increased CSF tracer influx, indicating a modulation of CSF-ISF exchange by tDCS. Additionally, tDCS appeared to enhance the brains metabolic waste efflux. EEG recordings showed an increase in delta wave post-tDCS. But no significant change in AQP4 expression was detected 30 minutes post-tDCS.\n\nConclusionOur findings suggest that tDCS augments the glymphatic systems influx and efflux. Through astrocyte IP3/Ca2+ signaling, tDCS was found to modify the delta wave, which correlates positively with brain clearance. This study underscores the potential of tDCS in modulating brain metabolic waste clearance.",

We previously demonstrated that extinction learning suppresses reactivation of these fear ensemble cells and activates a competing set of DG cells - the \"extinction ensemble.\" Here, we tested whether extinction was sufficient to suppress reactivation in other regions and used single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of cells in the dorsal dentate gyrus to examine how extinction affects the transcriptomic activity of fear ensemble and fear recall-activated cells. Our results confirm the suppressive effects of extinction in the dorsal and ventral dentate gyrus and demonstrate that this same effect extends to fear ensemble cells located in the dorsal CA1. Interestingly, the extinction-induced suppression of fear ensemble activity was not detected in ventral CA1. Our snRNA-seq analysis demonstrates that extinction training markedly changes transcription patterns in fear ensemble cells and that cells activated during recall of fear and recall of extinction have distinct transcriptomic profiles. Together, our results indicate that extinction training suppresses a broad portion of the fear ensemble in the hippocampus, and this suppression is accompanied by changes in the transcriptomes of fear ensemble cells and the emergence of a transcriptionally unique extinction ensemble.",

    "abstract": "It has been shown earlier that repeated positive fighting experience in daily agonistic interactions is accompanied by the development of psychosis-like behavior with signs of an addiction-like state associated with changes in the expression of genes encoding the proteins involved in the main neurotransmitter events in some brain regions of aggressive male mice. Fighting deprivation (a no-fight period of 2 weeks) causes a significant increase in their aggressiveness. This paper is aimed at studying--after a period of fighting deprivation--the involvement of genes (associated with neurotransmitter systems within the nucleus accumbens) in the above phenomena. The nucleus accumbens is known to participate in reward-related mechanisms of aggression. We found the following differentially expressed genes (DEGs), whose expression significantly differed from that in controls and/or mice with positive fighting experience in daily agonistic interactions followed by fighting deprivation: catecholaminergic genes Th, Drd1, Drd2, Adra2c, Ppp1r1b, and Maoa; serotonergic genes Maoa, Htr1a, Htr1f, and Htr3a; opioidergic genes Oprk1, Pdyn, and Penk; and glutamatergic genes Grid1, Grik4, Grik5, Grin3a, Grm2, Grm5, Grm7, and Gad1. The expression of DEGs encoding proteins of the GABAergic system in experienced aggressive male mice mostly returned to control levels after fighting deprivation except for Gabra5. In light of the conceptual paradigm for analyzing data that was chosen in our study, the aforementioned DEGs associated with the behavioral pathology can be considered responsible for consequences of aggression followed by fighting deprivation, including mechanisms of an aggression relapse.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Incentive-Sensitization Theory postulates that addiction is primarily driven by the sensitization of the brains reward system to addictive substances, such as nicotine. According to this theory, exposure to such substances leads to an increase in  wanting, while  liking the experience remains relatively unchanged. Although this candidate mechanism has been well substantiated through animal brain research, its translational validity for humans has only been partially demonstrated so far, with evidence from human neuroscience data being very limited.\n\nMethodsFrom fMRI data of N=31 individuals with Nicotine Use Disorder, we created multivoxel patterns capable of capturing wanting and liking-related dimensions from a smoking cue-reactivity task. Using these patterns, we then designed a novel resting-state  reading method to evaluate how much wanting or liking still persist as a neural trace after watching the cues.\n\nResultsWe found that the persistence of wanting-related brain patterns at rest increases with longer smoking history but this was not the case for liking-related patterns. Interestingly, such behavior has not been observed for non-temporal measures of smoking intensity.\n\nConclusionThis study provides basic human neuroscience evidence that the dissociation between liking and wanting escalates over time, further substantiating the Incentive-Sensitization Theory, at least for Nicotine Use Disorder. These results suggest that treatment approaches could be personalized to account for the variability in individuals neural adaptation to addiction by considering how individuals differ in the extent to which their incentive salience system is sensitized.",

    "abstract": "The rodent hippocampus is a spatially organized neuronal network that supports the formation of spatial and episodic memories. We conducted bulk RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics experiments to measure gene expression changes in the dorsal hippocampus following the recall of active place avoidance (APA) memory. Through bulk RNA sequencing, we examined the gene expression changes following memory recall across the functionally distinct subregions of the dorsal hippocampus. We found that recall induced differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the CA1 and CA3 hippocampal subregions were enriched with genes involved in synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity, while DEGs in the dentate gyrus (DG) were enriched with genes involved in energy balance and ribosomal function. Through spatial transcriptomics, we examined gene expression changes following memory recall across an array of spots encompassing putative memory-associated neuronal ensembles marked by the expression of the IEGs Arc, Egr1, and c-Jun. Within samples from both trained and untrained mice, the subpopulations of spatial transcriptomic spots marked by these IEGs were transcriptomically and spatially distinct from one another. DEGs detected between Arc+ and Arc-spots exclusively in the trained mouse were enriched in several memory-related gene ontology terms, including \"regulation of synaptic plasticity\" and \"memory.\" Our results suggest that APA memory recall is supported by regionalized transcriptomic profiles separating the CA1 and CA3 from the DG, transcriptionally and spatially distinct IEG expressing spatial transcriptomic spots, and biological processes related to synaptic plasticity as a defining the difference between Arc+ and Arc-spatial transcriptomic spots.",

    "abstract": "During infection, the giant phiKZ phage forms a specialized structure at the center of the host cell called the phage nucleus. This structure is crucial for safeguarding viral DNA against bacterial nucleases and for segregating the transcriptional activities of late genes. Here, we describe a morphological entity, the early phage infection vesicle (EPI vesicle), which appears to be responsible for earlier gene segregation at the beginning of the infection process. Using cryo-electron microscopy, electron tomography, and fluorescence microscopy with membrane-specific dyes, we found that the EPI vesicle is enclosed in a lipid bilayer originating, apparently, from the inner membrane of the bacterial cell. Our investigations further disclose that the phiKZ EPI vesicle contains both viral DNA and viral RNA polymerase (vRNAP). We have observed that the EPI vesicle migrates from the cell pole to the center, displaying co-localization with ChmA, the primary protein of the phage nucleus. While phage DNA is transported into the phage nucleus after phage maturation, the EPI vesicle remains outside. We hypothesized that the EPI vesicle acts as a membrane transport agent, efficiently delivering phage DNA to the phage nucleus while protecting it from the nucleases of the bacterium.",

    "abstract": "Trypanosoma brucei (T. brucei) parasites cause two major infectious diseases in Africa: African trypanosomiasis in humans (HAT) and Nagana in animals. Despite the enormous economic and social impact, vaccines and reliable diagnostic measures are still lacking for these diseases. The main obstacle to developing accurate diagnostic methods and an active vaccine is the parasites ability for antigenic variation and impairment of B cell maturation, which prevents the development of a long-lasting, effective immune response. The antigenic variation is sustained by random gene switching, segmental gene conversion, and altered glycosylation states of solvent-exposed regions of the corresponding variant surface glycoproteins (VSG). These glycoproteins use a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor for attachment to the membrane. GPIs of T. brucei have specific branched structures that are further heterogeneously galactosylated. We synthesized a glycan fragment library containing T. brucei GPIs most prominent structural features and performed an epitope mapping using mice and human sera of infected specimens using glycan microarrays. The studies indicate that in contrast to VSG, T. brucei GPIs are recognized by both short-lived IgM and long-lasting IgG, indicating a specific immune response against GPI structures. These findings enable the development of diagnostic tests based on synthetic antigens for reliable diagnosis of human African trypanosomiasis and Nagana.",

We performed a massive comparison of the  synthetic and  genomic approaches to generate background sequences for de novo motif discovery. The  synthetic approach shuffled nucleotides in peaks, while in the  genomic approach randomly selected sequences from the reference genome or only from gene promoters according to the fraction of A/T nucleotides in each sequence.

We showed that the genomic approach has both more robust detection of the known motifs of target transcription factors and more stringent exclusion of the simple sequence repeats as possible non-specific motifs.

    "abstract": "Phytoplankton are a major source of primary production. Their photosynthetic fluorescence uniquely reports on their type, physiological state and response to environmental conditions. Changes in phytoplankton photophysiology are commonly monitored by bulk fluorescence spectroscopy, where gradual changes are reported in response to different perturbations such as light intensity changes. What is the meaning of such trends in bulk parameters if their values report ensemble averages of multiple unsynchronized cells? To answer this, we developed an experimental scheme that enables acquiring multiple fluorescence parameters, from multiple excitation sources and spectral bands. This enables tracking fluorescence intensities, brightnesses and their ratios, as well as mean photon nanotimes equivalent to mean fluorescence lifetimes, one cell at a time. We monitored three different phytoplankton species during diurnal cycles and in response to an abrupt increase in light intensity. Our results show that we can define specific subpopulations of fluorescence parameters for each of the phytoplankton species and in response to varying light conditions. Importantly, we identify the cells undergo well-defined transitions between these subpopulations that characterize the different light behaviors. The approach shown in this work will be useful in the exact characterization of phytoplankton cell states and parameter signatures in response to different changes these cells experience in marine environments, which will be useful in monitoring marine-related effects of global warming.\n\nSignificance StatementUsing three representatives of red-linage phytoplankton we demonstrate distinct photophysiological behaviors at the single cell level. The results indicate cell wide coordination into discrete cell states. We test cell state transitions as a function of light acclimation during diurnal cycle and in response to large intensity increases, which stimulate distinct photoprotective response mechanisms. The analysis was made possible through the development of flow-based confocal detection at multiple excitation and emission wavelengths monitoring both pigment composition and photosynthetic performance. Our findings show that with enough simultaneously recorded parameters per each cell, the detection of multiple phytoplankton species at their distinct cell states is possible. This approach will be useful in examining the response of complex natural marine populations to environmental perturbations.",

Here, we solved the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the human CCR8-Gi complex in the absence of a ligand. Structural analysis and comparison revealed that CCR8 in our apo structure undergoes some conformational change and is similar to that in the CCL1-CCR8 complex structure, indicating an active state. In addition, the key residues of CCR8 involved in the recognition of LMD-009, a potent nonpeptidic agonist, were investigated by mutating CCR8 and testing the calcium flux induced by LMD-009-CCR8 interaction. Two mutants of CCR8, Y1133.32A, and E2867.39A, showed a dramatically decreased ability in mediating calcium mobilization, indicating their key interaction with LMD-009.

    "abstract": "Lateral lipid heterogeneity (i.e., raft formation) in biomembranes plays a functional role in living cells. Three-component mixtures of low- and high-melting lipids plus cholesterol offer a simplified experimental model for raft domains in which a liquid-disordered (Ld) phase coexists with a liquid-ordered (Lo) phase. Using such models, we recently showed that cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) can detect phase separation in lipid vesicles based on differences in bilayer thickness. However, the considerable noise within cryo-EM data poses a significant challenge for accurately determining the membrane phase state at high spatial resolution. To this end, we have developed an image processing pipeline that utilizes machine learning (ML) to predict the bilayer phase in projection images of lipid vesicles. Importantly, the ML method exploits differences in both the thickness and molecular density of Lo compared to Ld, which leads to improved phase identification. To assess accuracy, we used artificial images of phase-separated lipid vesicles generated from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of Lo and Ld phases. Synthetic ground truth datasets mimicking a series of compositions along a tieline of Ld+Lo coexistence were created and then analyzed with various ML models. For all tieline compositions, we find that the ML approach can correctly identify the bilayer phase at 5 nm lateral resolution with > 90% accuracy, thus providing a means to isolate the intensity profiles of coexisting Ld and Lo phases, as well as accurately determine domain size distributions, number of domains, and phase area fractions. The method described here provides a framework for characterizing nanoscopic lateral heterogeneities in membranes and paves the way for a more detailed understanding of raft properties in biological contexts.\n\nSignificanceLipid rafts are important for cell function, but in most cases cannot be detected with conventional optical microscopy because of their extremely small size. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), because of its much greater spatial resolution, is capable of imaging domains as small as 5-10 nm. In this report, we show how machine learning techniques can be used to automatically and accurately identify raft-like domains in simulated cryo-EM images, a powerful approach that could ultimately lead to a better understanding of raft properties.",

However, the etiology of dementia is complicated. The present study reveals that an aberrant splicing of DDIT4L, the isoform DDIT4L intron retention (DIR), occurs in AD patients. Homozygous DIR-knock-in (KI) mice showed DIR expression in hippocampal neurons, marked cognitive impairment, augmented A{beta} deposition and enhanced Tau phosphorylation. The DIR colocalized with thioflavin S-positive plaques and gelsolin in AD patients. The DIR induced A{beta} deposition and cognitive impairment by interacting with gelsolin. Moreover, DIR interacted with GluA1, the subunit of the AMPA receptor, contributing to synaptic deficiency and cognitive impairment. Furthermore, an anti-DIR monoclonal antibody (mAb) alleviated cognitive impairment and reduced A{beta} deposition and Tau phosphorylation. Thus, DIR contributes to cognitive impairment and amyloid plaques, and could be a potential therapeutic target for dementia.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, our understanding of the gut microbiomes impact on host physiology and metabolism has grown exponentially. Yet, the specific role of certain microorganisms in regulating gestational health and fetal development remains largely unexplored. During pregnancy, Bifidobacterium represents a key beneficial microbiota genus that provides multiple benefits, including changes in placental development and fetal glycaemia. In this study, using germ-free mice colonized with or without Bifidobacterium breve UCC2003 during pregnancy, we demonstrated that this bacterium is important for controlling fetal brain metabolism. In particular, presence of maternal Bifidobacterium led to reduced levels of ten metabolites (including citrate, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate, and carnitine) in the fetal brain, with concurrent elevated abundance of transporters involved in glucose and branched-chain amino acid uptake. B. breve supplementation was also associated with increased expression of critical metabolic and cellular pathways, including the PI3K-AKT, AMPK, STAT5 and Wnt-{beta}-catenin (including its receptor Frizzled-7) in the fetal brain. Furthermore, maternal-associated Bifidobacterium resulted in HIF-2 protein stabilization and altered a number of genes and proteins involved in cellular growth, axogenesis, and mitochondrial function. These findings highlight that Bifidobacterium breve colonisation of the maternal gut is important for the metabolism and growth of the fetal brain.",

    "abstract": "Two DNA repair pathways, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and alternative end joining (A-EJ), are involved in V(D)J recombination and chromosome translocation. Previous studies reported distinct repair mechanisms for chromosome translocation, with NHEJ involved in human and A-EJ in mice predominantly. NHEJ depends on DNA-PKcs, a critical partner in synapsis formation and downstream component activation. While DNA-PKcs inhibition promotes chromosome translocations harboring microhomologies in mice, its synonymous effect in humans is not known. We find partial DNA-PKcs inhibition in human cells leads to increased translocations and the continued involvement of a dampened NHEJ. In contrast, complete DNA-PKcs inhibition substantially increased microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ), thus bridging the two different translocation mechanisms between human and mice. Similar to a previous study on Ku70 deletion, DNA-PKcs deletion in G1/G0-phase mouse progenitor B cell lines, significantly impairs V(D)J recombination and generated higher rates of translocations as a consequence of dysregulated coding and signal end joining. Genetic DNA-PKcs inhibition suppresses NHEJ involvement entirely, with repair phenotypically resembling Ku70-deficient A-EJ. In contrast, we find DNA-PKcs necessary in generating the near-excusive MMEJ associated with Lig4 deficiency. Our study underscores DNA-PKcs in suppressing illegitimate chromosome rearrangement while also contributing to MMEJ in both species.",

    "abstract": "Movement requires maneuvers that generate thrust to either make turns or move the body forward in physical space. The computational space for perpetually controlling the relative position of every point on the body surface can be vast. We hypothesize the evolution of efficient design for movement that minimizes active (neural) control by leveraging the passive (reactive) forces between the body and the surrounding medium at play. To test our hypothesis, we investigate the presence of stereotypical postures during free-swimming in adult zebrafish, Danio rerio. We perform markerless tracking using DeepLabCut, a deep learning pose estimation toolkit, to track geometric relationships between body parts. To identify putative clusters of postural configurations obtained from twelve freely behaving zebrafish, we use unsupervised multivariate time-series analysis (B-SOiD machine learning software). When applied to single individuals, this method reveals a best-fit for 36 to 50 clusters in contrast 86 clusters for data pooled from all 12 animals. The centroids of each cluster obtained over 14,000 sequential frames recorded for a single fish represent an apriori classification into relatively stable \"target body postures\" and inter-pose \"transitional postures\" that lead to and away from a target pose. We use multidimensional scaling of mean parameter values for each cluster to map cluster-centroids within two dimensions of postural space. From a post-priori visual analysis, we condense neighboring postural variants into 15 superclusters or core body configurations. We develop a nomenclature specifying the anteroposterior level/s (upper, mid and lower) and degree of bending. Our results suggest that constraining bends to mainly three levels in adult zebrafish preempts the neck, fore- and hindlimb design for maneuverability in land vertebrates.",

The quantification of AA and tryptophan (TRP) metabolites in human serum and plasma is therefore of great diagnostic interest. Robust and reproducible sample extraction and processing workflows as well as rapid, sensitive absolute quantification of AA and TRP metabolites are required to identify candidate biomarkers and to improve current screening methods. We developed a validated semi-automated extraction and sample processing workflow using a robotic liquid handling platform and a rapid method for the absolute quantification of 20 free, underivatized AAs and 6 TRP metabolites using dual-column U(H)PLC-MRM-MS. The automated extraction and sample preparation workflow is designed for use in a 96-well plate format, allowing robust and reproducible high sample throughput without the need for further SPE, evaporation and/or buffer exchange. Samples extracted from serum and/or plasma in 96-well plates can be transferred directly to the U(H)PLC autosampler. The dual-column U(H)PLC-MRM-MS method, using a mixed- mode reversed-phase anion exchange column with formic acid as mobile phase modifier and a high- strength silica reversed-phase column with difluoroacetic acid as mobile phase additive, provided absolute quantification with nanomolar lower limits of quantification (LLOQ) for all metabolites except glycine (LLOQ: 2.46 {micro}M) in only 7.9 minutes.

    "abstract": "Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungal pathogen that causes cryptococcosis mostly in immune compromised patients, such as those with HIV/AIDS. One survival mechanism of C. neoformans during infection is melanin production, which is catalyzed by laccase. Hence comparative assessment of laccase activity is useful for characterizing cryptococcal strains. After a serendipitous observation that culturing C. neoformans with food coloring resulted in the degradation of some dyes with phenolic structures, we associated this phenomenon with catalytic activity by cryptococcal laccase. Consequently, we investigated the color changes for the food dyes metabolized by C. neoformans laccase and explored using this effect for the development of colorimetric assays to measure laccase activity. We developed several versions of a food dye based colorimetric laccase assay that can be used to compare the relative laccase activities between different C. neoformans strains. We found that phenolic color degradation was glucose dependent, which may reflect changes in the reduction properties of the media. Our food color based colorimetric assay has several advantages over the commonly used 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) assay for laccase activity, including lower cost, no reversibility and easier application since it does not require constant monitoring. Our method has potential applications in environmental fields, since laccases can be used to degrade pollutants in bodies of water, and this is an efficient test to determine laccase activity. Additionally, it is useful for comparing laccase activity across different C. neoformans strains, which can provide insight into the expression of this virulence factor across strains.\n\nImportanceCryptococcus neoformans is present in the environment and while infection is common, disease occurs mostly in immunocompromised individuals. C. neoformans infection in the lungs results in symptoms like pneumonia, and consequently cryptococcal meningitis occurs if the fungal infection spreads to the brain. The laccase enzyme catalyzes the melanization reaction that serves as a virulence factor of C. neoformans. Developing a simple and less costly assay to determine levels of laccase activity of C. neoformans, as compared to the commonly used 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) assay, is useful as a quick, permanent measure of laccase activity that could provide insight as to the relative virulence of the fungal cells tested. Environmental applications of this assay include determining which fungal strains would be best to degrade dye-related pollutants in wastewater.",

    "abstract": "DNA base editors could enable direct editing of adenine (A), cytosine (C), or guanine (G), but there is no base editor for direct thymine (T) editing currently. Here, by fusing Cas9 nickase (nCas9) with engineered human uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG) variants, we developed a deaminase-free glycosylase-based thymine base editor (gTBE) with the ability of direct T editing. By several rounds of UNG mutagenesis via rational screening, we demonstrated that gTBE with engineered UNG variants could achieve T editing efficiency by up to 81.5%. Furthermore, the gTBE exhibited high T-to-S (i.e., T-to-C or T-to-G) conversion ratio with up to 0.97 in cultured human cells. Using similar strategy, we developed a deaminase-free cytosine base editor (gCBE) facilitating specifically direct C editing by engineered UNG with mutations different from gTBE. Thus, we provide two novel base editors, gTBE and gCBE, with corresponding engineered UNG variants, broadening the targeting scope of base editors.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFunctionally coupled large myocardial grafts and a remarkable improvement of heart function in nonhuman primate models of myocardial infarction have been reported after transplantation of human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes at relatively high numbers of up to 109 single cell cardiomyocytes - a dose equivalent to total cell loss after myocardial infarction in [~]10 times larger human hearts. To overcome apparent limitations associated with the application of single cells, this pre-clinical study investigated the injection of cardiomyocyte aggregates instead.\n\nMethodsHuman iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte aggregates were produced in scalable suspension culture. Intramyocardial injection of the aggregates into cynomolgus monkey hearts was conducted two weeks after myocardial infarction induced by permanent coronary artery ligation. Human cell engraftment was assessed after two weeks or three months; functional analyses included continuous telemetric ECG recording and repeated cardiac MRI assessment in comparison to sham treated animals.\n\nResultsTreatment with cell numbers as low as 5 x 107 resulted in efficient structural engraftment. Notably, the degree of heart function recovery in vivo seemed to correlate with the contractility of the applied cardiomyocytes tested by parallel experiments in vitro. Graft-induced non-life-threatening arrhythmias were transient and decreased considerably during the three months follow-up.\n\nConclusionsTransplantation of human iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte aggregates yielded comparable results to the reported application of higher numbers of single cell cardiomyocytes from human ESC, suggesting that the application of cardiomyocyte aggregates facilitates cell therapy development by reducing cell production costs and clinical risks associated with the administration of relatively high cell numbers.\n\nClinical PerspectiveWhat is new?\n\nO_LIIn contrast to previously applied single cells, human iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte aggregates (hiCMAs) were transplanted in a non-human primate (NHP) model of MI, to reduce the required cell dose, promote myocardial retention of the graft, and limit the risks for adverse effects. Such low-dose treatment with almost pure ventricular cardiomyocytes produced under GMP-compliant conditions, resulted in the formation of relative large, structurally integrated human grafts in NHP hearts.\nC_LIO_LITransient non-life-threatening arrhythmias associated with intramyocardial cell transplantation decreased considerably during the three months follow-up.\nC_LIO_LIA remarkable recovery of left ventricular function was observed. This recovery notably correlated with the in vitro contractility of transplanted cardiomyocyte batches tested in bioartificial cardiac tissues (BCTs), underlining the relevance of a suitable potency assay.\nC_LI\n\nWhat are the clinical implications?\n\nO_LIIntra-myocardial injection of hiCMAs is a promising treatment modality for the recovery of contractile function after MI; their advanced production, storage and testing revealed in the study facilitate the clinical translation of hiPSC-based heart repair.\nC_LIO_LIThe need for relatively low numbers of cardiomyocytes produced through advanced protocols for scalable suspension culture reduces production costs of adequate cell batches, thereby increasing treatment availability. In vitro testing of the produced cell batches is required to ensure treatment efficacy.\nC_LIO_LIClinical hiCMA injection can be considered reasonably safe, however, pharmacological prevention and treatment of arrhythmias is required and temporary implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) could be considered.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Choline is an essential nutrient for cellular metabolism, including the biosynthesis of phospholipids, neurotransmitters, and one-carbon metabolism. A critical step of choline catabolism is the mitochondrial import and synthesis of chorine-derived methyl donors, such as betaine. However, the underlying mechanisms and the biological significance of mitochondrial choline catabolism remain insufficiently understood. Here, we report that a mitochondrial inner-membrane protein SLC25A48 controls mitochondrial choline transport and catabolism in vivo. We demonstrate that SLC25A48 is highly expressed in brown adipose tissue and required for whole-body cold tolerance, thermogenesis, and mitochondrial respiration. Mechanistically, choline uptake into the mitochondrial matrix via SLC25A48 facilitates betaine synthesis and one-carbon metabolism. Importantly, cells lacking SLC25A48 exhibited reduced synthesis of purine nucleotides and failed to initiate the G1-to-S phase transition, thereby leading to cell death. Taken together, the present study identified SLC25A48 as a mitochondrial carrier that mediates choline import and plays a critical role in mitochondrial respiratory capacity, purine nucleotide synthesis, and cell survival.\n\nKey pointsO_LISLC25A48 is required for mitochondrial choline uptake.\nC_LIO_LIMitochondrial choline uptake regulates one-carbon contribution to purine nucleotide synthesis.\nC_LIO_LIBrown fat thermogenesis requires mitochondrial choline catabolism for respiratory capacity.\nC_LIO_LICancer cells require mitochondrial choline uptake for cell survival.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Human naive pluripotent stem cells (nPSCs) can differentiate into extra-embryonic trophectoderm (TE), a critical step in the generation of the integrated embryo model termed blastoid. The current paradigm of blastoid generation necessitates the aggregation of dozens of nPSCs treated with multiple small molecule inhibitors, growth factors, or genetic modifications to initiate TE differentiation. The presence of complex crosstalk among pathways and cellular heterogeneity in these models complicates mechanistic study and genetic screens. Here, we show that a single small molecule, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), potently induces TE differentiation in basal medium without pharmacological and genetic perturbations. DMSO enhances blastoid generation and, more importantly, is sufficient for blastoid generation by itself. DMSO blastoids resemble blastocysts in morphology and lineage composition. DMSO induces blastoid formation through PKC signaling and cell cycle regulation. Lastly, DMSO enables single nPSC-derived clonal blastoids, which could facilitate genetic screens for mechanistic understanding of human embryogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The precise spatio-temporal expression of the hematopoietic ETS transcription factor PU.1 that determines the hematopoietic cell fates is tightly regulated at the chromatin level. However, it remains elusive as to how chromatin signatures are linked to this dynamic expression pattern of PU.1 across blood cell lineages. Here we performed an unbiased and in-depth analysis of the relationship between human PU.1 expression, the presence of trans-acting factors, and 3D architecture at various cis-regulatory elements (CRE) proximal to the PU.1 locus. We identified multiple novel CREs at the upstream region of the gene following an integrative inspection for conserved DNA elements at the chromatin-accessible regions in primary human blood lineages. We showed that a subset of CREs localize within a 10 kb-wide cluster that exhibits that exhibit molecular features of a myeloid-specific super-enhancer involved in mediating PU.1 autoregulation, including open chromatin, unmethylated DNA, histone enhancer marks, transcription of enhancer RNAs, and occupancy of the PU.1 protein itself. Importantly, we revealed the presence of common 35-kb-wide CTCF-bound insulated neighborhood that contains the CRE cluster, forming the chromatin territory for lineage-specific and CRE-mediated chromatin interactions. These include functional CRE-promoter interactions in myeloid and B cells but not in erythroid and T cells. Our findings also provide mechanistic insights into the interplay between dynamic chromatin structure and 3D architecture in defining certain CREs as enhancers or silencers in chromatin regulation of PU.1 expression. The study lays the groundwork for further examination of PU.1 CREs as well as epigenetic regulation in malignant hematopoiesis.",

    "abstract": "Lasso peptides exhibit a unique lariat-like knotted structure imparting exceptional stability and thus show promise as therapeutic agents that target cell-surface receptors. One such receptor is the human endothelin ETB receptor, which is implicated in challenging cancers with poor immunotherapy responsiveness. The Streptomyces-derived lasso peptide, RES-701-3, is a selective inhibitor for ETB and a compelling candidate for therapeutic development. However, meager production from a genetically recalcitrant host has limited further structure-activity relationship studies of this potent inhibitor. Here, we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of ETB receptor in both its apo form and complex with RES-701-3, facilitated by a calcineurin-fusion strategy. Hydrophobic interactions between RES-701-3 and the transmembrane region of the receptor, especially involving two tryptophan residues, play a crucial role in RES-701-3 binding. Furthermore, RES-701-3 prevents conformational changes associated with G-protein coupling, explaining its inverse agonist activity. A comparative analysis with other lasso peptides and their target proteins highlights the potential of lasso peptides as precise drug candidates for G-protein-coupled receptors. This structural insight into RES-701-3 binding to ETB receptor offers valuable information for the development of novel therapeutics targeting this receptor and provides a broader understanding of lasso peptide interactions with human cell-surface receptors.",

    "abstract": "Objective. Intracortical microstimulation can be an effective method for restoring sensory perception in contemporary brain-machine interfaces. However, the mechanisms underlying better control of neuronal responses remain poorly understood, as well as the relationship between neuronal activity and other concomitant phenomena occurring around the stimulation site. Approach. Different microstimulation frequencies were investigated in vivo on Thy1-GCaMP6s mice using widefield and two-photon imaging to evaluate the evoked excitatory neural responses across multiple spatial scales as well as the induced hemodynamic responses. Specifically, we quantified stimulation-induced neuronal activation and depression in the mouse visual cortex and measured hemodynamic oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin signals using mesoscopic-scale widefield imaging. Main results. Our calcium imaging findings revealed a preference for lower-frequency stimulation in driving stronger neuronal activation. A depressive response following the neural activation preferred a slightly higher frequency stimulation compared to the activation. Hemodynamic signals exhibited a comparable spatial spread to neural calcium signals. Oxyhemoglobin concentration around the stimulation site remained elevated during the post-activation (depression) period. Somatic and neuropil calcium responses measured by two-photon microscopy showed similar dependence on stimulation parameters, although the magnitudes measured in soma was greater than in neuropil. Furthermore, higher-frequency stimulation induced a more pronounced activation in soma compared to neuropil, while depression was predominantly induced in soma irrespective of stimulation frequencies. Significance. These results suggest that the mechanism underlying depression differs from activation, requiring ample oxygen supply, and affecting neurons. Our findings provide a novel understanding of evoked excitatory neuronal activity induced by intracortical microstimulation and offer insights into neuro-devices that utilize both activation and depression phenomena to achieve desired neural responses.",

Through systematic benchmarking involving transcription factor knockout experiments, we demonstrated performance on par with state-of-the-art methods, with our method being easily applicable to other cell types of interest. We present case studies using three cancer single-cell datasets to showcase the utility of these cell-type-specific regulons in exploring transcriptional dysregulation.

    "abstract": "The increasing frequency of emerging viral infections calls for more efficient and low-cost drug design methods. Peptide binders have emerged as a strong contender to curb the pandemic due to their efficacy, safety, and specificity. Here, we propose a customizable low-cost pipeline incorporating model auditing strategy and data-centric methodology for controllable peptide generation.\n\nA generative protein language model, pretrained on approximately 140 million protein sequences, is directionally fine-tuned to generate peptides with desired properties and binding specificity. The subsequent multi-level structure screening reduces the synthetic distribution space of peptide candidates regularly to identify authentic high-quality samples, i.e. potential peptide binders, at in silico stage. Paired with molecular dynamics simulations, the number of candidates that need to be verified in wet-lab experiments is quickly reduced from more than 2.2 million to 16. These potential binders are characterized by enhanced yeast display to determine expression levels and binding affinity to the target. The results show that only a dozen candidates need to be characterized to obtain the peptide binder with ideal binding strength and binding specificity. Overall, this work achieves efficient and low-cost peptide design based on a generative language model, increasing the speed of de novo protein design to an unprecedented level. The proposed pipeline is customizable, that is, suitable for rapid design of multiple protein families with only minor modifications.",

    "abstract": "Combating the threat of multidrug resistance bacteria requires many different approaches. Using structural motifs and sequences from existing antibacterial compounds affords a fresh attack against such bacteria, while circumventing inherited resistance against the existing compound. Gramicidin is a 16 amino acid peptide with an alternating L- and D-motif with highly bacteriocidal effects in gram-positive membranes. In the membrane it assumes a {beta}-helix form with two peptides aligned by their N-terminal interactions, and only conducts in such a form. Using gramicidin as a basis, this study employs molecular dynamics simulations as an initial design step and evaluates gramicidin-derived candidates based on their backbone hydrogen-bond interactions, capacity for conductance, profile of their RMSD over the course of the simulation, and how the peptide interacts with the phospholipid headgroups. There are twelve candidate systems with results comparable to gramicidin and the factors at play in their efficacy are examined.",

    "abstract": "Basolateral amygdala (BLA) neuronal responses to conditioned stimuli are closely linked to the expression of conditioned behavior. An area of increasing interest is how the dynamics of BLA neurons relate to evolving behavior. Here, we recorded the activity of individual BLA neurons across the acquisition and extinction of conditioned reward seeking and employed population-level analyses to assess ongoing neural dynamics. We found that, with training, sustained cue-evoked activity emerged that discriminated between the CS+ and CS-and correlated with conditioned responding. This sustained population activity continued until reward receipt and rapidly extinguished along with conditioned behavior during extinction. To assess the contribution of orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a major reciprocal partner to BLA, to this component of BLA neural activity, we inactivated OFC while recording in BLA and found blunted sustained cue-evoked activity in BLA that accompanied reduced reward seeking. Optogenetic disruption of BLA activity and OFC terminals in BLA also reduced reward seeking. Our data suggest that sustained cue-driven activity in BLA, which in part depends on OFC input, underlies conditioned reward-seek-ing states.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria employ antagonistic strategies to eliminate competitors of an ecological niche. Contact-dependent mechanisms, such as the type VI secretion system (T6SS), are prevalent in host-associated bacteria, yet we know relatively little about how T6SS+ strains make contact with competitors in highly viscous environments, such as host mucus. To better understand how cells respond to and contact one another in such environments, we performed a genome-wide transposon mutant screen of the T6SS-wielding beneficial bacterial symbiont, Vibrio fischeri, and identified two sets of genes that are conditionally required for killing. LPS/capsule and flagellar-associated genes do not affect T6SS directly and are therefore not required for interbacterial killing when cell contact is forced yet are necessary for killing in high-viscosity liquid (hydrogel) where cell-cell contact must be biologically mediated. Quantitative transcriptomics revealed that V. fischeri significantly increases expression of both T6SS genes and cell surface modification factors upon transition from low-to high-viscosity media. Consistent with coincubation and fluorescence microscopy data, flagella are not required for T6SS expression in hydrogel. However, flagella play a key role in responding to the physical environment by promoting expression of the surface modification genes identified in our screen, as well as additional functional pathways important for host colonization including uptake of host-relevant iron and carbon sources, and nitric oxide detoxification enzymes. Our findings suggest that flagella may act as a mechanosensor for V. fischeri to coordinately activate competitive strategies and host colonization factors, underscoring the significance of the physical environment in directing complex bacterial behaviors.\n\nSignificanceThe physical environment can have dramatic effects on bacterial behavior, but little is known about how mechanical signals impact antagonistic interactions. Symbiotic bacteria use molecular weapons to eliminate competitors for limited space within highly viscous host tissue and mucus.\n\nTo better understand how the physical environment affects competition and adhesion within eukaryotic hosts, we used quantitative transcriptomics to reveal the flagella-dependent transcriptional response to bacterial transition from lower to a higher viscosity environment. This work revealed the T6SS interbacterial weapon is coordinately activated with host colonization factors, emphasizing the importance of integrating activation of interbacterial weapons into host colonization pathways to enhance a symbionts ability to successfully colonize the host while efficiently eliminating potential competitors from the host niche.",

    "abstract": "N-terminal arginine (NTR) methylation is a conserved feature of PIWI proteins, which are central components of the PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway. The significance and precise function of PIWI NTR methylation in mammals remains unknown. In mice, PIWI NTRs bind Tudor domain containing proteins (TDRDs) that have essential roles in piRNA biogenesis and the formation of the chromatoid body. Using mouse MIWI (PIWIL1) as paradigm, we demonstrate that the NTRs are essential for spermatogenesis through the regulation of transposons and gene expression. Surprisingly, the loss of TDRD5 and TDRKH interaction with MIWI results in defective piRNA amplification, rather than an expected failure of piRNA biogenesis. We find that piRNA amplification is necessary for both transposon control and for sustaining levels of select, nonconserved, pachytene piRNAs that target specific mRNAs required for spermatogenesis. Our findings support the notion that the vast majority of pachytene piRNAs are dispensable, acting as autonomous genetic elements that rely for propagation on MIWI piRNA amplification. MIWI-NTRs also mediate interactions with TDRD6 that are necessary for chromatoid body compaction. Furthermore, MIWI-NTRs promote stabilization of spermiogenic transcripts that drive nuclear compaction, which is essential for sperm formation. In summary, the NTRs underpin the diversification of MIWI protein function.\n\nKey pointsO_LIMIWI-NTRs coordinate interactions with TDRDs required for piRNA biogenesis to sustain piRNA amplification\nC_LIO_LIMIWI-NTRs are necessary for both transposon control and for sustaining levels of select pachytene piRNAs that target specific mRNAs required for spermiogenesis\nC_LIO_LIMIWI-NTRs mediate interactions with TDRD6 to compact the Chromatoid Body\nC_LIO_LIMIWI-NTRs underlie stabilization of spermiogenic transcripts that drive nuclear compaction, which is essential for sperm formation\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The endocytic pathway is both an essential route of molecular uptake in cells and a potential entry point for pathology-inducing cargo. The cell-to-cell spread of cytotoxic aggregates, such as those of -synuclein (-syn) in Parkinsons Disease (PD), exemplifies this duality. Here we used a human iPSC-derived induced neuronal model (iNs) prone to death mediated by aggregation in late endosomes and lysosomes of endogenous -syn, seeded by internalized pre-formed fibrils of -syn (PFFs). This PFF-mediated death was not observed with parental iPSCs or other non-neuronal cells. Using live-cell optical microscopy to visualize the read out of biosensors reporting endo-lysosome wounding, we discovered that up to about 10% of late endosomes and lysosomes in iNs exhibited spontaneous constitutive perforations, regardless of the presence of internalized PFFs. This wounding, absent in parental iPSCs and non-neuronal cells, corresponded to partial damage by nanopores in the limiting membranes of a subset of endolysosomes directly observed by volumetric focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) in iNs and in CA1 pyramidal neurons from mouse brain, and not found in iPSCs or in other non-neuronal cells in culture or in mouse liver and skin.\n\nWe suggest that the compromised limiting membranes in iNs and neurons in general are the primary conduit for cytosolic -syn to access PFFs entrapped within endo-lysosomal lumens, initiating PFF-mediated -syn aggregation. Significantly, eradicating the intrinsic endolysosomal perforations in iNs by inhibiting the endosomal Phosphatidylinositol-3-Phosphate/Phosphatidylinositol 5-Kinase (PIKfyve kinase) using Apilimod or Vacuolin-1 markedly reduced PFF-induced -syn aggregation, despite PFFs continuing to enter the endolysosomal compartment. Crucially, this intervention also diminished iN death associated with PFF incubation.\n\nOur results reveal the surprising presence of intrinsically perforated endo-lysosomes in neurons, underscoring their crucial early involvement in the genesis of toxic -syn aggregates induced by internalized PFFs. This discovery offers a basis for employing PIKfyve kinase inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy to counteract synucleinopathies.",

    "abstract": "During neuronal development, dynamic filopodia emerge from dendrites and mature into functional dendritic spines during synaptogenesis. Dendritic filopodia and spines respond to extracellular cues, influencing dendritic spine shape and size as well as synaptic function. Previously, the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM9 was shown to regulate filopodia in early stages of neuronal development, including netrin-1 dependent axon guidance and branching. Here we demonstrate TRIM9 also localizes to dendritic filopodia and spines of murine cortical and hippocampal neurons during synaptogenesis and is required for synaptic responses to netrin. In particular, TRIM9 is enriched in the post-synaptic density (PSD) within dendritic spines and loss of Trim9 alters the PSD proteome, including the actin cytoskeleton landscape. While netrin exposure induces accumulation of the Arp2/3 complex and filamentous actin in dendritic spine heads, this response is disrupted by genetic deletion of Trim9. In addition, we document changes in the synaptic receptors associated with loss of Trim9. These defects converge on a loss of netrindependent increases in neuronal firing rates, indicating TRIM9 is required downstream of synaptic netrin-1 signaling. We propose TRIM9 regulates cytoskeletal dynamics in dendritic spines and is required for the proper response to synaptic stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Telomerase activity plays a crucial role in maintaining telomere length and cellular immortality, making it an attractive target for cancer therapy. The human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) promoter contains a G-rich region that can form G-quadruplex (G4) structures, which have been shown to regulate hTERT expression. In this study, we used in silico screening and molecular dynamics simulations to identify phytocompounds that can stabilize the G4 structure in the hTERT promoter. We performed shape-based and pharmacophore-based screening of a phytochemical database and identified two lead compounds with assistance from oleanolic acid and maslinic acid as controls which showed in vitro telomerase activity. Molecular docking and replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations for a temperature profile of 300K to 350K were used to evaluate the binding affinity and stability of these compounds with two different G4 conformations in the hTERT promoter. Our results suggest that astragaloside-1 can stabilize the parallel-stranded G4 conformation (2kze) in the hTERT promoter, while novel compounds may be required to stabilize the intramolecular G4 conformation (2kzd).

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWSpindle oscillation is a waxing-and-waning neural oscillation observed in the brain, initiated at the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) and typically occurring at 7 - 15 Hz. Recent experiments revealed that in the adult brain, electrical synapses, rather than chemical synapses, are dominating between TRN neurons, indicating that the traditional view of spindle generation via chemical synapses in the TRN needs to be revised. Here, based on the known experimental data, we develop a computational model of the TRN network, in which heterogeneous neurons are connected by electrical synapses. The model consists of two driving forces competing to shape the network dynamics: electrical synapses tend to synchronize neurons, while heterogeneity tends to desynchronize neurons. We demonstrate that the interplay between two forces leads to a network state where multiple synchronized clusters with slightly different oscillation frequencies coexist. In this state, the superposition of neuronal activities gives rise to spindle oscillation, as observed in local field potentials in experiments. Notably, we discover that when TRN neurons generate spindle oscillation, the network operates at the critical state, known for facilitating efficient information processing in complex systems. Our study sheds light on the underlying mechanism of spindle oscillation and its functional significance in neural information processing.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial ATP production is fuelled by a fatty acid flux generated by phospholipase and triglyceride lipases in metabolically demanding tissues such as heart and liver, while the brain has long been believed to use almost solely glucose for energy. Phospholipase A1 enzyme DDHD2 is a major triglyceride lipase in the brain, and the loss of DDHD2 function results in a saturated free fatty acid (sFFA) imbalance and lipid droplet (LD) accumulation in the brain. The LD accumulation in neurons has been enigmatic as LDs are mainly considered to serve as a fuel storage. Here, we demonstrate that the loss of DDHD2 results in a mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction that leads to a significant decrease in ATP production and acetyl coenzyme A levels in neurons, even when the glycolytic breakdown of glycose occurs normally. Loss of DDHD2 also leads to a presynaptic defect as well as an imbalance in the global protein homeostasis in the neurons. These defects were rescued by external supplementation of the sFFA myristic acid coupled with its cofactor coenzyme A (Myr-CoA), indicating sFFA fuelling for neuronal {beta}-oxidation. We have thus discovered that the sFFAs released by the activity of DDHD2 play a central role in providing energy to fuel synaptic function.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryFree fatty acids released by DDHD2 activity play a central role in maintaining neuronal energy levels and synaptic function.",

Investigating cell type-specific alterations through single-cell transcriptome analysis holds promise in understanding symptom development and pathogenesis. In this study, we performed single nuclei RNA (snRNA) sequencing of dorsal root ganglions (DRG) to explore the molecular mechanism underlying paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain. Mouse exposed to repeated paclitaxel doses developed persistent pain hypersensitivity lasting at least 21 days. The snRNA sequencing unveiled seven major cell types within DRGs, with neurons further subdivided into 12 distinct subclusters using known markers. Notably, type C low-threshold mechanoreceptors (C_LTMR) exhibited the most pronounced transcriptomic changes post-paclitaxel administration. Differential gene expression and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis highlighted suppressed potassium-related currents, microtubule transport, and mitochondrial functions in C_LTMR following paclitaxel treatment. Meanwhile, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) suggested increased Interleukin 17 production in C_LTMR after paclitaxel exposure. Pseudo-time analysis uncovered nine distinct states (state 1 to 9) of C_LTMR. State 1 exhibits higher prevalence in paclitaxel-treated mice and altered neurotransmission properties, likely contributing to paclitaxel-induced pain hypersensitivity. This comprehensive exploration sheds light on the molecular mechanisms driving paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain, offering potential avenues for therapeutic intervention.",

Here we extended our findings by examining other parameters that may influence the outcome of context-conditioned overconsumption training. We found that the task worked equally well in males and females, and that palatable substances such as high-fat diet and Ensure chocolate milkshake supported learning and induced overconsumption. Surprisingly, mice did not overconsume when sucrose was used as the reinforcer during training, suggesting that nutritional content is a critical factor.

    "abstract": "Light sheet microscopy is a powerful technique for high-speed 3D imaging of subcellular dynamics and large biological specimens. How-ever, it often generates datasets ranging from hundreds of gigabytes to petabytes in size for a single experiment. Conventional com-putational tools process such images far slower than the time to acquire them and often fail outright due to memory limitations. To address these challenges, we present LLSM5DTools, a scalable soft-ware solution for efficient petabyte-scale light sheet image processing. This software incorporates a suite of commonly used processing tools that are memory and performance-optimized. Notable advancements include rapid image readers and writers, fast and memory-efficient geometric transformations, high-performance Richardson-Lucy decon-volution, and scalable Zarr-based stitching. These features outperform state-of-the-art methods by over one order of magnitude, enabling the processing of petabyte-scale image data at the full teravoxel rates of modern imaging cameras. The software opens new avenues for biological discoveries through large-scale imaging experiments.",

    "abstract": "We present BATH, a tool for highly sensitive annotation of protein-coding DNA based on direct alignment of that DNA to a database of protein sequences or profile hidden Markov models (pHMMs). BATH is built on top of the HMMER3 code base, and simplifies the annotation workflow for pHMM-based annotation by providing a straightforward input interface and easy-to-interpret output. BATH also introduces novel frameshift-aware algorithms to detect frameshift-inducing nucleotide insertions and deletions (indels). BATH matches the accuracy of HM-MER3 for annotation of sequences containing no errors, and produces superior accuracy to all tested tools for annotation of sequences containing nucleotide indels. These results suggest that BATH should be used when high annotation sensitivity is required, particularly when frameshift errors are expected to interrupt protein-coding regions, as is true with long read sequencing data and in the context of pseudogenes.",
