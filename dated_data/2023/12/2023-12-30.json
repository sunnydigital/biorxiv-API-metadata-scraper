    "abstract": "ABSRACTO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSOlder humans who take high levels of vitamin D supplementation for a prolonged time may be at risk of vitamin D toxicity. It is unclear how dietary super-doses (10,000x greater than requirement) can affect vitamin D status in aged animals. Aged laying hens could be a model to compare vitamin D supplementation effects with women in peri-or postmenopausal stages of life.\n\nObjectiveWe investigated dietary super-dose impacts of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) on vitamin D status in aged laying hens in production.\n\nMethodsForty-eight 68 wk old Hy-Line Brown laying hens were individually housed in cages with eight hens per dietary treatment for eleven weeks. Hens were randomly assigned to one of six treatment groups of dietary vitamin D3 supplementation and fed ad libitum. Supplementation levels were 400, 800, 7,400, 14,000, 20,000, and 36,000 IU D3/kg of feed. At the end of the study, all hens were euthanized and tissue samples and feces were collected. Plasma and egg yolk vitamin D metabolites, calcium and phosphorus composition of multiple sites, and tissue gene expression levels were measured.\n\nResultsWe observed that increasing dietary vitamin D3 increased plasma vitamin D3 and egg yolk vitamin D3 (p < 0.0001 for both sites). We also observed an increase in plasma 24,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol as dietary vitamin D3 levels increased (p < 0.0001). The plasma 25-hydroxycholecalciferol:24,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol ratio exhibited an asymptotic relationship starting at the 14,000 IU/kg D3 treatment.\n\nConclusionsDietary super-doses of vitamin D3 led to greater plasma and egg yolk vitamin D levels to show that aged laying hens can deposit excess vitamin D in egg yolk. We suggest future research should explore how 24-hydroxylation mechanisms are affected by vitamin D supplementation. Further understanding of 24-hydroxylation can help ascertain ways to reduce risk of vitamin D toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Blood-brain barrier (BBB) models derived from human stem cells are powerful tools to improve our understanding of cerebrovascular diseases and to facilitate drug development for the human brain. Yet providing stem cell-derived endothelial cells with the right signaling cues to acquire BBB characteristics while also retaining their vascular identity remains challenging. Here, we show that the simultaneous activation of cyclic AMP and Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling, and inhibition of the TGF-{beta} pathway in endothelial cells robustly induce BBB properties in vitro. To target this novel interaction, we present a small molecule cocktail named cARLA, which synergistically enhances barrier tightness in a range of BBB models across species. Mechanistically, we reveal that the three pathways converge on Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling to mediate the effect of cARLA via the tight junction protein claudin-5. We demonstrate that cARLA shifts the gene expressional profile of human stem cell-derived endothelial cells towards the in vivo brain endothelial signature, with a higher glycocalyx density and efflux pump activity, lower rates of endocytosis and a characteristic endothelial response to proinflammatory cytokines. Finally, we illustrate how cARLA can improve the predictive value of human BBB models regarding the brain penetration of drugs and targeted nanoparticles. Due to its synergistic effect, high reproducibility and ease of use, cARLA has the potential to advance drug development for the human brain by improving BBB models across laboratories.\n\nSignificance StatementThe blood-brain barrier (BBB) hinders drug delivery to the brain and is implicated in neurological diseases. To better understand these processes in humans, there is a need for culture models that mimic the complexity of the BBB. However, state-of-the-art human BBB models either suffer from a non-physiological, mixed epithelial-endothelial identity or have weak barrier tightness, which greatly limits their usability. We identified a molecule combination that synergistically enhances barrier tightness in several in vitro models and induces complex BBB properties in human stem cell-derived endothelial cells by targeting a novel link between three signaling pathways. The molecule combination has the potential to improve BBB culture models across laboratories to advance both basic research and drug development for the human brain.",

However, it is unclear what conditions allow for fast and successful learning, especially in non-human subjects. To determine how rapidly freely-moving mice can learn a new rule, we designed a two-alternative forced-choice visual discrimination paradigm in which the rules governing the task can change between sessions. We find that experienced animals can learn a new rule after being exposed to only five training and three testing trials. The propensity for single session learning improves over time and is accurately predicted based on animal experience and rule difficulty. After establishing procedural learning of a paradigm, mice continuously improve their performance on new rules. Thus, mice learn to learn.",

    "abstract": "Recent experimental studies in the awake brain have identified a rule for synaptic plasticity that is instrumental for the instantaneous creation of memory traces in area CA1 of the mammalian brain: Behavioral Time scale Synaptic Plasticity (BTSP). This one-shot learning rule differs in essential aspects from previously considered plasticity mechanisms. We introduce a transparent model for the core function of BTSP, and establish a theory that enables a principled understanding of the system of memory traces that it creates. Our theoretical predictions and numerical simulations show that BTSP is able to create a functionally powerful content-addressable memory without the need for high-resolution synaptic weights. Furthermore, it reproduces the repulsion effect of human memory, whereby traces for similar memory items are pulled apart to enable differential downstream processing. Altogether, our results create a link between synaptic plasticity in area CA1 of the hippocampus and its network function. They also provide a blueprint for implementing content-addressable memory with on-chip learning capability in highly energy-efficient crossbar arrays of memristors.",

    "abstract": "Lassa virus (LASV), a mammarenavirus from Arenaviridae, is the causative agent of Lassa fever (LF) endemic in West Africa. Currently, there are no vaccines or antivirals approved for LF. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) of RNA viruses are error-prone. As a negative-sense RNA virus, how LASV copes with errors in RNA synthesis and ensures optimal RNA replication are not well elucidated. LASV nucleoprotein (NP) contains a DEDDH 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease motif (ExoN), which is known to be essential for LASV evasion of the interferon response via its ability to degrade virus-derived double-stranded RNA. Herein, we present evidence that LASV NP ExoN has an additional function important for viral RNA replication. We rescued an ExoN-deficient LASV mutant (ExoN- rLASV) by using a reverse genetics system. Our data indicated that abrogation of NP ExoN led to impaired LASV growth and RNA replication in interferon-deficient cells as compared with wild-type rLASV. By utilizing PacBio Single Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT) long-read sequencing technology, we found that rLASV lacking ExoN activity was prone to producing aberrant viral genomic RNA with structural variations. In addition, NP ExoN deficiency enhanced LASV sensitivity to mutagenic nucleoside analogues in virus titration assay. Next-generation deep sequencing analysis showed increased single nucleotide substitution in ExoN- LASV RNA following mutagenic 5-flurouracil treatment. In conclusion, our study revealed that LASV NP ExoN is required for efficient viral RNA replication and mutation control. Among negative-sense RNA viruses, LASV NP is the first example that a viral protein, other than the RdRp, contributes to reduce errors in RNA replication and maintain genomic RNA integrity. These new findings promote our understanding of the basics of LASV infection and inform antiviral and vaccine development.\n\nAuthors SummaryLassa fever (LF) is a severe and often fatal disease endemic in West Africa. There is no vaccines or antivirals approved for LF. The disease is caused by Lassa virus (LASV), a member of the arenavirus family. LASV nucleoprotein (NP) contains a DEDDh exoribonuclease (ExoN) motif, through which NP degrades virus-derived, immunostimulatory double-stranded RNA and inhibit host innate immune response. Thus, it is well known that NP ExoN is important for LASV pathogenicity. Intriguingly, the NP ExoN motif is highly conserved among arenaviruses, regardless of pathogenicity and viral ability to evade innate immune response, suggesting arenavirus NP ExoN may have additional function(s) in virus infection. In this study, we found that loss of ExoN activity affected LASV multiplication and RNA replication in interferon-deficient Vero cells. The ExoN-deficient rLASV exhibited reduced level of viral RNA, increased frequency of structural variation in virus genomic RNA, and higher mutation rate following mutagenic nucleoside analogue treatment. In conclusion, LASV NP ExoN plays an important role in viral RNA replication and fitness. Our new findings may inform antiviral and vaccine development and have broader implication on the function of NP ExoN of other arenaviruses.",

At the same time, advances in mean-field techniques have led to biologically based population models that integrate biophysical features such as membrane conductances or synaptic conductances. In this paper, we show that this approach can lead to brain-wide models of mouse, macaque, and human. We illustrate this approach by showing the transition from wakefulness to sleep simulated with multi-scale models in the three species. We compare the level of synchrony between the three species and found that the mouse brain displays a higher overall synchrony of slow-waves compared to monkey and human brains. We show that these differences are due to the different delays of axonal signal propagation between regions associated to brain-size differences between the species. We also make the program code publicly available, which provides a set of open-source tools for simulating large-scale activity in the cerebral cortex of mouse, monkey, and human.",

    "abstract": "For investigating the effects of pesticides on bee colonies in actual apiaries, field experiments in an open environment are effective. It is natural to assume that the total food or pesticide intake taken by a honey bee colony includes their intakes from nature in addition to each administered in the field experiment. Therefore, in field experiments, setting the administration-concentration of pesticides for honey bee colonies is one of the most difficult tasks.\n\nThe validity of pesticide concentrations administered to bee colonies was evaluated by various intakes of pesticides and foods obtained from five long-term field experiments conducted in Midwest Japan with distinct changes of four seasons and Maui, U.S.A. without cold winter.\n\nThe author found a relationship, logPBD=logCP-2.4, between pesticide concentration (CP) and the average daily intake of pesticide ingested by one bee (PBD), and found that their ratio PBD/CP was about 1/250, which was significantly lower than the LD50 value.\n\nThis fact supports that the concentration of pesticide administration in long-term field experiments conducted so far was not too high, but rather reasonable.\n\nIn addition, the average daily intakes of sugar syrup and pollen paste ingested by one bee was found to be 3.1 mg/bee/day and 0.8 mg/bee/day, respectively, and notwithstanding their wide variation, be roughly constant regardless of the concentration of pesticides.\n\nI believe that this paper will help provide new guidelines for setting pesticide dosing concentrations, which have not been clear so far, in field experiments on the administration of pesticides to bee colonies.",

    "abstract": "Biopolymer condensates often emerge as a multi-droplet state and never coalesce into one large droplet within the experimental timespan. This contradicts the prediction of classical polymer physics which suggests the existence of one large droplet beyond the phase transition. Previous work revealed that the sticker-spacer architecture of biopolymers may dynamically stabilize the multi-droplet state. Here, we simulate the condensate coalescence using metadynamics approach and reveal two distinct physical mechanisms underlying the fusion of droplets. Condensates made of sticker-spacer polymers readily undergo a kinetic arrest when stickers exhibit slow exchange while fast exchanging stickers at similar levels of saturation allow merger to equilibrium states. On the other hand, condensates composed of homopolymers fuse readily until they reach a threshold density. We also show that the inter-condensate exchange of chains offers a general mechanism that drives the fusion. We map the range of mechanisms of kinetic arrest from slow sticker exchange dynamics to density mediated in terms of energetic separation of stickers and spacers. Our predictions appear to be in excellent agreement with recent experiments probing dynamic nature of protein-RNA condensates.\n\nSignificance statementA key conundrum of biological condensates is the coexistence of multiple droplets, in direct variance with classical predictions of mean-field theories of polymer solutions. We systematically investigated the coalescence tendency of such condensates made of sticker-spacer polymers and discovered that, even at a low density, these droplets show a kinetically arrested metastable state which is a distinct behavior compared to condensates made of homopolymers. Coupling of inter-sticker interaction strength and the finite valence nature of stickers enables kinetic arrest. Our prediction starkly correlates with recent experimental findings on protein-RNA condensates in vitro and in vivo, highlighting the biological relevance of the interplay of kinetics and thermodynamics.",

The current GUANinE tasks provide insight into the performance of existing genomic AI models and non-neural baselines, with opportunities to be refined, revisited, and broadened as the field matures.

This raises the question about the adequacy of relying on human reference genomes to accurately analyze sequencing data derived from experimental cell lines. Here, we generated the complete diploid genome assembly for the human retinal epithelial cells (RPE-1), a widely used non-cancer laboratory cell line with a stable karyotype, to use as matched reference for multi-omics sequencing data analysis. Our RPE1v1.0 assembly presents completely phased haplotypes and chromosome-level scaffolds that span centromeres with ultra-high base accuracy (>QV60). We mapped the haplotype-specific genomic variation specific to this cell line including t(Xq;10q), a stable 73.18 Mb duplication of chromosome 10 translocated onto the microdeleted chromosome X telomere t(Xq;10q). Polymorphisms between haplotypes of the same genome reveals genetic and epigenetic variation for all chromosomes, especially at centromeres. The RPE-1 assembly as matched reference genome improves mapping quality of multi-omics reads originating from RPE-1 cells with drastic reduction in alignments mismatches compared to using the most complete human reference to date (CHM13). Leveraging the accuracy achieved using a matched reference, we were able to identify the kinetochore sites at base pair resolution and show unprecedented variation between haplotypes.

However, these predictions are unverifiable because the true biological age of reprogrammed cells remains unknown. We present an analytical framework to consider rejuvenation predictions from the uncertainty perspective. Our analysis reveals that the DNA methylation profiles across reprogramming are poorly represented in the aging data used to train clock models, thus introducing high epistemic uncertainty in age estimations. Moreover, predictions of different published clocks are inconsistent, with some even suggesting zero or negative rejuvenation. While not questioning the possibility of age reversal, we show that the high clock uncertainty challenges the reliability of rejuvenation effects observed during in vitro reprogramming prior to pluripotency and throughout embryogenesis. Conversely, our method reveals a significant age increase after in vivo reprogramming. We recommend including uncertainty estimation in future aging clock models to avoid the risk of misinterpreting the results of biological age prediction.",

    "abstract": "Nearly two-thirds of patients with Alzheimers are women. Identifying therapeutics specific for women is critical to lowering their elevated risk for developing this major cause of adult dementia. Moreover, targeting epigenetic processes that regulate multiple cellular pathways is advantageous given Alzheimers multifactorial nature. Histone acetylation is an epigenetic process heavily involved in memory consolidation. Its disruption is linked to Alzheimers.\n\nThrough our computational studies, we predicted that the investigational drug RG2833 (N-[6-(2-aminoanilino)-6-oxohexyl]-4-methylbenzamide) has repurposing potential for Alzheimers. RG2833 is a histone deacetylase HDAC1/3 inhibitor that is orally bioavailable and permeates the blood-brain-barrier. We investigated the RG2833 therapeutic potential in TgF344-AD rats, which are a model of Alzheimers that exhibits age-dependent progression, thus mimicking this aspect of Alzheimers patients that is difficult to establish in animal models. We investigated the RG2833 effects on cognitive performance, gene expression, and AD-like pathology in 11-month TgF344-AD female and male rats. A total of 89 rats were used: wild type n = 45 (17 females, 28 males), and TgF344-AD n = 44 (24 females, 20 males)] across multiple cohorts.\n\nNo obvious toxicity was detected in the TgF344-AD rats up to 6 months of RG2833-treatment starting at 5 months of age administering the drug in rodent chow at [~]30mg/kg of body weight. We started treatment early in the course of pathology when therapeutic intervention is predicted to be more effective than in later stages of the disease. The drug-treatment significantly mitigated hippocampal-dependent spatial memory deficits in 11-month TgF344-AD females but not in males, compared to wild type littermates. This female sex-specific drug effect has not been previously reported. RG2833-treatment failed to ameliorate amyloid beta accumulation and microgliosis in female and male TgF344-AD rats. However, RNAseq analysis of hippocampal tissue from TgF344-AD rats showed that drug-treatment in females upregulated the expression of immediate early genes, such as Arc, Egr1 and c-Fos, and other genes involved in synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation. Remarkably, out of 17,168 genes analyzed for each sex, no significant changes in gene expression were detected in males at P < 0.05, false discovery rate < 0.05, and fold-change [&ge;] 1.5.\n\nOur data suggest that histone modifying therapeutics such as RG2833 improve cognitive behavior by modulating the expression of immediate early, neuroprotective and synaptic plasticity genes. Our preclinical study supports that RG2833 has therapeutic potential specifically for female Alzheimers patients. RG2833 evaluations using other AD-related models is necessary to confirm our findings.",

    "abstract": "Excess fat gain culminating in obesity is a mounting global pandemic associated with a myriad of diseases including a higher risk of developing multiple cancers such as breast cancer. The underlying biological basis for obesity-linked breast cancer is attributed to alterations in adipose tissue-derived endocrine, metabolic and inflammatory factors. However, the precise cell types responsible for generating a cancer-susceptible mammary gland in obesity are not well understood. Using diet-induced obesity in conjunction with genetic reporter mouse models, we reveal elevated mammary adipocyte progenitors (MAPs) expressing Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor alpha (PDGFR) in the mammary tissue microenvironment during obesity. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis demonstrate intensified obesity-driven trajectories of MAPs to immune and epithelial progenitor cells. Further, lineage tracing indicates an invasive cellular state of MAPs that confers greater access of MAP descendants into the mammary epithelium concomitant with their transition into immune and epithelial cell fates. MAPs in obesity exhibit heightened activation of cancer-associated and inflammatory pathways where Egfr is identified as a common target upregulated in MAPs. Mechanistic studies on purified MAPs with a major obesity diet component and EGFR stimulation corroborate dynamic EGFR-mediated MAP responses. Our findings uncover MAPs as key contributors to forging an aberrant mammary gland in obesity, providing insight into the potential utility of targeting this cell lineage for eradicating cancer risk related to augmented adiposity.",

    "abstract": "Chromosomal translocations involving the Lysine-Methyl-Tansferase-2A (KMT2A) locus generate potent oncogenes that cause highly aggressive acute leukemias1. KMT2A and the most frequent translocation partners encode proteins that interact with DNA to regulate developmental gene expression2. KMT2A-oncogenic fusion proteins (oncoproteins) contribute to the epigenetic mechanisms that allow KMT2A-rearranged leukemias to evade targeted therapies. By profiling the oncoprotein-target sites of 34 KMT2A-rearranged leukemia samples, we find that the genomic enrichment of oncoprotein binding is highly variable between samples. At high levels of expression, the oncoproteins preferentially activate either the lymphoid or myeloid lineage program depending on the fusion partner. These fusion-partner-dependent binding sites correspond to the frequencies of each mutation in acute lymphoid leukemia versus acute myeloid leukemia. By profiling a sample that underwent a lymphoid-to-myeloid lineage switching event in response to lymphoid-directed treatment, we find the global oncoprotein levels are reduced and the oncoprotein-target gene network changes. At lower levels of expression, the oncoprotein shifts to a non-canonical regulatory program that favors the myeloid lineage, and in a subset of resistant patients, the Menin inhibitor Revumenib induces a similar response. The dynamic shifts in KMT2A oncoproteins we describe likely contribute to epigenetic resistance of KMT2A-rearranged leukemias to targeted therapies.",

    "abstract": "Vitamin A deficiency remains prevalent on a global scale, including in regions where maize constitutes a high percentage of human diets. One solution for alleviating this deficiency has been to increase grain concentrations of provitamin A carotenoids in maize (Zea mays ssp. mays L.)--an example of biofortification. The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) developed a Carotenoid Association Mapping panel of 380 inbred lines adapted to tropical and subtropical environments that have varying grain concentrations of provitamin A and other health-beneficial carotenoids. This project assesses the accuracy of several genomic prediction (GP) strategies for these traits ({beta}-carotene, {beta}-cryptoxanthin, provitamin A, lutein, and zeaxanthin) within and between four environments in Mexico. Methods employing Ridge Regression-Best Linear Unbiased Prediction, Elastic Net, or Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces had high accuracy in predicting all tested provitamin A carotenoid traits and outperformed Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator. Furthermore, prediction accuracies were higher when using genome-wide markers rather than only the markers proximal to two previously identified carotenoid-related genes that have been used in marker-assisted selection, suggesting that GP is worthwhile for these traits, even though key genes have already been identified. Prediction accuracy was maintained for all traits (except lutein) in between-environment prediction. The TASSEL (Trait Analysis by aSSociation, Evolution, and Linkage) Genomic Selection plugin performed as well as other more computationally intensive methods for within-environment prediction. The findings observed herein indicate the utility of GP methods for these traits and could inform their resource-efficient implementation in biofortification breeding programs.",

We report here that changes in GTP availability resulting from altered cellular physiology modulate the rate of NCT, as monitored using synthetic and natural cargo, and the dynamics of Ran itself. Cell migration, cell spreading and/or modulation of the cytoskeleton or its connection to the nucleus alter GTP availability and thus rates of NCT, regulating RNA export and protein synthesis. These findings support a model in which changes in cellular physiology that alter GTP availability can regulate the rate of NCT, impacting fundamental cellular processes that extensively utilize NCT.\n\nSummaryChanges in the availability of cellular GTP resulting from physiologically relevant processes, including cell migration and cell spreading, alter the rates of Ran-dependent nuclear import and export.

Here we uncover a role for CAPS in spindle formation during mitosis. Our experiments suggest that CAPS is a microtubule-binding, spindle-associated protein that helps create the kinetochore fibers that bind and segregate chromosomes. Knockdown of CAPS causes a variety of defects during mitosis, including uncongressed chromosomes and multi-polar spindles, as well as high levels of apoptosis and a reduced mitotic index. We find that CAPS promotes microtubule bundling, both in vitro and in cells, and knockdown of CAPS leads to reduction of thick k-fibers in the mitotic spindle. The high level of CAPS observed in many forms of cancer suggests that CAPS may promote cell proliferation, but our results indicate that CAPS overexpression has little effect on the cell cycle. This suggests that the high level of CAPS expression may be a consequence of cancer, rather than a driving force for cell proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Photon emission by single molecules is a random event that has a well-defined distribution. This calls for event-based detection in single-molecule localization microscopy. The detector has the advantage of providing the arrival time of photons and their distribution (emission characteristics) within a single blinking period (typically, [~] 30 ms) of a single molecule. This information can be used to better localize single molecules within a user-defined collection time (shorter than average blinking time) of the event detector. The events collected over every short interval of time ( [~] 3 ms) give rise to several independent photon distributions (PSFs) of single molecules in the event camera. The experiment showed that single molecules intermittently emit photons. So, capturing events over a shorter period than the entire blinking period gives rise to several realizations of single-molecule PSFs. Specifically, this translates to a sparse collection of active pixels per frame on the detector chip (image plane). Ideally, multiple realizations of single-molecule PSF give several position estimates of the single-molecules, leading to multiple PSF centroids. Fitting these centroid points by a circle gives an approximate position (circle center) and geometric localization precision (circle area) of a single molecule. Since the single-molecule estimate (position and localization precision) is directly driven by the photon detection events and the recorded PSF, the estimated value is purely experimental rather than theoretical (Thomsons formula). Moreover, this eliminates the need for noise calculation and background estimation. The method is tested on three different test samples (1) Scattered Cy3 dye molecules on a coverslip, (2) Mitochondrial network in a cell, and (3) Dendra2HA transfected NIH3T3 cells (Influenza-A model). A super-resolution map is constructed and analyzed based on the detection of events / photons. Experimental results on transfected NIH3T3 cells show a localization precision of [~] 10 nm, which is [~] 3.5 fold better than standard SMLM. Results reveal a spatio-temporal resolution (lp x t) of 122.5p (where, p = 10-12 meter.second) (measured in terms of localization precision). Cluster analysis of HA molecules shows > 81% colocalization with standard SMLM, indicating the consistency of the proposed eventSMLM technique. Moreover, single-molecule imaging on live cells reveals the temporal dynamics (migration, association, and dissociation) of HA clusters for the first time over a period of 60 minutes. With the availability of event-based detection and high temporal resolution, we envision the emergence of a new kind of microscopy capable of high spatio-temporal super-resolution microscopy (in the range [~] 1p = 10-12 meter.sec).",

BK displays shallow voltage sensitivity with very fast gating charge kinetics, yet little is known about the molecular underpinnings of this distinctive behavior. Here, we explore the mechanistic basis of coupling between voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) and calcium sensors in Aplysia BK by locking the VSDs in their resting (R196Q and R199Q) and activated (R202Q) states, with or without calcium. Cryo-EM structures of these mutants reveal unique tilts at the S4 C-terminal end, together with large side-chain rotameric excursions of the gating charges. Importantly, the VSD resting structure (R202Q) also revealed BK in its elusive fully closed state, highlighting the reciprocal relation between calcium and voltage sensors. These structures provide a plausible mechanism where voltage and Ca2+ binding converge physically and couple energetically to define the conformation of the pore domain and thus, BK full functional range.",

In middle-age ovaries, the decline in the number of transzonal projections was accompanied by a decrease in cumulus cell-oocyte interactions, resulting in a deterioration of the oocyte quality. Scanning electron microscopy showed the ZP surface microfilament structure transitioning from rugged to smooth with age, leading to decreased fertilization rates due to impaired sperm binding to the ZP. Moreover, the fertilization rate of middle-age mice was restored to a comparable level to that of young mice by destabilizing the ZP in the presence of glutathione. These results suggest that the age-related structural changes in the ZP is a key for successful fertilization at reproductive age.",

    "abstract": "Phosphorylation of connexin 43 (Cx43) is an important regulatory mechanism of gap junction (GJ) function. Cx43 is modified by several kinases on over 15 sites within its [~]140 amino acid-long C-terminus (CT). Phosphorylation of Cx43CT on S255, S262, S279, and S282 by ERK has been widely documented in several cell lines, by many investigators. Phosphorylation of these sites by JNK and p38, on the other hand, is not well-established. Indeed, ERK is a kinase activated by growth factors and is upregulated in diseases, such as cancer. JNK and p38, however, have a largely tumor-suppressive function due to their stress-activated and apoptotic role. We investigated substrate specificity of all three MAPKs toward Cx43CT, both in vitro and in two cell lines (MDCK - non-cancerous, epithelial cells and porcine PAECs - pulmonary artery endothelial cells). Cx43 phosphorylation was monitored through gel-shift assays on an SDS-PAGE, immunodetection with phospho-Cx43 antibodies, and LC-MS/MS phosphoproteomic analyses. Our results demonstrate that p38 and JNK specificity differ from each other and from ERK. JNK has a strong preference for S255 and S279, while p38 readily phosphorylates S279 and S282. In addition, while we confirmed that ERK can phosphorylate all four serines (255, 262, 279, and 282), we identified T290 as a novel ERK phosphorylation site. This work underscores the importance of delineating the effects of ERK, JNK, and p38 signaling pathways on Cx43 and GJ function.",

    "abstract": "Microcircuit function is determined by patterns of connectivity and short-term plasticity that vary with synapse type. Elucidating microcircuit function therefore requires synapse-specific investigation. The state of the art for synapse-specific measurements has long been paired recordings. Although powerful, this method is slow, leading to a throughput problem. To improve yield, we therefore created optomapping -- an approximately 100-fold faster 2-photon optogenetic method -- which we validated with paired-recording data. Using optomapping, we tested 15,433 candidate excitatory inputs to find 1,184 connections onto pyramidal, basket, and Martinotti cells in mouse primary visual cortex, V1. We measured connectivity, synaptic weight, and short-term dynamics across the V1 layers. We found log-normal synaptic strength distributions, even in individual inhibitory cells, which was previously not known. We reproduced the canonical circuit for pyramidal cells but found surprising and differential microcircuit structures, with excitation of basket cells concentrated to layer 5, and excitation of Martinotti cells dominating in layer 2/3. Excitation of inhibitory cells was denser, stronger, and farther-reaching than excitation of excitatory cells, which promotes stability and difference-of-Gaussian connectivity. We gathered an excitatory short-term plasticitome, which revealed that short-term plasticity is simultaneously target-cell specific and dependent on presynaptic cortical layer. Peak depolarization latency in pyramidal cells also emerged as more heterogeneous, suggesting heightened sensitivity to redistribution of synaptic efficacy. Optomapping additionally revealed high-order connectivity patterns including shared-input surplus for interconnected pyramidal cells in layer 6. Optomapping thus offered both resolution to the throughput problem and novel insights into the principles of neocortical excitatory fine structure.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LI2-photon optomapping of microcircuits is verified as fast, accurate, and reliable\nC_LIO_LISynaptic weights distribute log-normally even for individual inhibitory neurons\nC_LIO_LIMaximal excitation of basket and Martinotti cells in layer 5 and 2/3, respectively\nC_LIO_LIShort-term plasticity depends on layer in addition to target cell\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The basolateral amygdala is a non-layered cortical structure playing a role in various cognitive processes. Despite many studies focusing on local information processing within the circuits of the basolateral amygdala, the characteristics of excitatory principal neurons (PNs) are still not fully revealed. Here, we combined neuroanatomical, electrophysiological, and tracing techniques to determine the single-cell features, dendritic and axonal projections of PNs within the lateral (LA) and basal amygdala (BA). Using a mouse reporter line, we found that cholecystokinin (CCK) expression defines two spatially and functionally segregated groups of PNs both in the LA and BA. PNs in CCK-positive (CCK+) areas of the LA (LAa) had small somata and short dendrites which matched their single-cell electrophysiological properties. PNs in CCK-negative (CCK-) areas of the LA (LAp) and all BA had similarly ramified dendrites and single-cell features with some differences. Importantly, the dendritic arbors of PNs were restricted to the subnuclei defined by CCK expression, which corresponded to various extra-amygdalar afferents indicating specific inputs on distinct PN groups. Axonal arborization patterns of PNs within the basolateral amygdala and surrounding areas showed consistency to their soma location. For instance, BA PNs that projected to the medial prefrontal cortex but not to the lateral nucleus of the central amygdala were present in CCK+ areas. In contrast, those BA PNs that projected to the lateral part of the central nucleus were found in the subnucleus lacking CCK. Our study revealed that the basolateral amygdala is composed of functionally different subnuclei with specific inputs and outputs. This structural arrangement may empower the LA and BA to flexibly channel processed information toward their downstream regions, which can be a key requirement for diverse amygdala functions in cognitive operation.",

    "abstract": "The speed at which we move is linked to the speed at which we decide to make these movements. Yet, the principles guiding such relationship remain unclear: while some studies point towards a shared invigoration process boosting decision and movement speed jointly, others rather indicate a tradeoff between both levels of control, with slower movements accompanying faster decisions. Here, we aimed (1) at further investigating the existence of a shared invigoration process linking decision and movement and (2) at testing the hypothesis that such a link is masked when detrimental to the reward rate. To this aim, we tested 62 subjects who performed the tokens task in two experiments (separate sessions): Experiment 1 evaluated how changing decision speed affects movement speed while Experiment 2 assessed how changing movement speed affects decision speed. In the latter experiment, subjects were either encouraged to favor decision speed (fast decision group) or decision accuracy (slow decision group). Various mixed model analyses revealed a coregulation of decision (urgency) and movement speed in Experiment 1 and in the fast decision group of Experiment 2, but not in the slow decision group despite the fact that these same subjects displayed a coregulation effect in Experiment 1. Altogether, our findings support the idea that coregulation occurs as a default mode but that this form of control is diminished or supplanted by a tradeoff relationship, contingent on reward rate maximization. Drawing from these behavioral observations, we propose that multiple processes contribute to shaping the speed of decisions and movements.\n\nNew & NoteWorhtyThe principles guiding the relationship between decision and movement speed are unclear. In the present behavioral study involving two experiments conducted on 62 human subjects, we report findings indicating a relationship that varies as a function of the task goals. Coregulation emerges as a default mode of control that fades when detrimental to the reward rate, possibly due to the influence of other processes that can selectively shape the speed of our decisions and movements.",

    "abstract": "In both clinical and observational studies, sleep quality is usually assessed by subjective self-report. The literature is mixed about how accurately these self-reports track objectively (e.g. via polysomnography) assessed sleep quality, with frequent reports of a very low or no association. However, previous research on this question focused on between-subject designs, which may be confounded by trait-level variables. In the current study, we used the novel Budapest Sleep, Experiences and Traits Study (BSETS) dataset to investigate if within-subject differences in subjectively reported sleep quality are related to sleep macrostructure and quantitative EEG variables assessed using a mobile EEG headband. We found clear evidence that within-subject variations in sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, total sleep time, and sleep efficiency affect self-reported sleep quality in the morning. These effects were replicated if detailed sleep composition metrics (percentage and latency of specific vigilance states) or two alternative measures of subjective sleep quality are used instead. We found no effect of the number of awakenings or relative EEG delta and sigma power. Between-subject effects (relationships between individual mean values of sleep metrics and subjective sleep quality) were also found, highlighting that analyses focusing only on these may be erroneous. Our findings show that while previous investigations of this issue may have been confounded by between-subject effects, objective sleep quality is indeed reflected in subjective sleep ratings.",

Here, we systematically addressed the influence of postnatal or juvenile fluoxetine treatment on anxio-depressive behavior, gene expression, mitochondrial biogenesis, and neuronal cytoarchitecture in adulthood.\n\nMethodsRat pups received postnatal fluoxetine (PNFlx) or juvenile fluoxetine (JFlx) treatment from postnatal day 2 (P2)-P21 or P28-48 respectively, and were assessed for changes in anxio-depressive behaviors, global gene expression, mitochondrial biogenesis/function, and dendritic cytoarchitecture in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in adulthood.\n\nResultsPNFlx evoked long-lasting increases in anxio-depressive behaviors, whereas JFlx elicited persistent decreases in anxio-depressive behavior, accompanied by differential and minimally overlapping transcriptional changes in the mPFC in adulthood. We noted opposing changes in mitochondrial function and dendritic cytoarchitecture in the mPFC of PNFlx and JFlx animals, with a decline observed following PNFlx and an increase in response to JFlx treatment. Furthermore, the enhanced despair-like behavior in the PNFlx cohort was reversed by adult-onset treatment with nicotinamide, a precursor for NAD+ which enhances mitochondrial bioenergetics.\n\nConclusionsFluoxetine treatment in early postnatal versus juvenile windows evokes opposing and persistent effects on anxio-depressive behavior in adult male rats, along with differential effects on gene expression, mitochondrial function, and dendritic morphology in the mPFC. Collectively, our findings highlight two distinct temporal windows in which fluoxetine exposure programs starkly differing outcomes in mood-related behavior, and posits a role for altered bioenergetics within the mPFC in contributing to these distinctive changes in emotionality.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMultiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease characterized by neuronal and synaptic loss, resulting in an imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission. MS leads to cognitive impairment such as reduced information processing speed and impaired working memory (WM). Recent studies have suggested that the 1/f slope of EEG/MEG power spectra can be associated with the excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance. A normal E/I balance is crucial for normal information processing and working memory.\n\nMethodsWe analyzed magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings of 38 healthy control subjects and 79 people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) while performing an n-back working task. We computed and compared the steepness of the 1/f spectral slope through the FOOOF algorithm in the time windows [-1 0] and [0 1] s peristimulus time for both target and distractor stimulus for each brain parcel and for different working memory loads (0-back, 1-back, 2-back).\n\nResultsThe spectral slope was significantly steeper after the stimulus onset and was correlated with reaction time. We also observed a steeper 1/f slope after distractor stimuli in healthy subjects compared to pwMS. Finally, we observed significant correlations between the 1/f spectral slope modulation and visuospatial working memory functioning in both healthy subjects and pwMS.\n\nConclusionOur findings are consistent with an increased inhibition following stimulus onset. In pwMS, this increase is reduced, suggesting dysfunctional inhibition of irrelevant information.

    "abstract": "Disorders of consciousness (DoC) are a challenging and complex group of neurological conditions characterised by absent or impaired awareness. The current range of therapeutic options for DoC patients is limited, offering few non-invasive pharmacological alternatives. This situation has sprung a growing interest in the development of novel treatments, such as the proposal to study the efficacy of 5HT2A receptor agonists (also known as psychedelics) to restore impaired consciousness. Given the ethical implications of exploring novel compounds in non-communicative individuals, we assessed in silico their effects in the whole-brain dynamics of DoC patients. We embedded the whole-brain activity of patients in a low-dimensional space, and then used this representation to visualise the effects of simulated neuromodulation across a range of receptors representing potential drug targets. Our findings show that activation of serotonergic and opioid receptors shifted brain dynamics of DoC patients towards patterns typically seen in conscious and awake individuals, and that this effect was mediated by the brain-wide density of activated receptors. These results showcase the role of whole-brain models in the discovery of novel pharmacological treatments for neuropsychiatric conditions, while also supporting the feasibility of accelerating the recovery of consciousness with serotonergic psychedelics.",

    "abstract": "Exposure therapy is an established treatment for anxiety disorders but the mechanisms underpinning its effectiveness remain unclear. Two theories offer contrasting perspectives: the traditional habituation model posits that a form of stimulus desensitization is required during exposure, while the inhibitory learning model emphasizes the formation of new non-fearful associations. Crucially, while the former may manifest as amygdala habituation, the latter may not. To distinguish between the two models, this study uses functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the amygdala responses of spider-fearful participants during fear exposure. We hypothesized that intervention success might align with stable or even increased amygdala activation - an indicator of active engagement and re-learning as proposed by the inhibitory learning model. Conversely, decreasing amygdala activity might not be a sign of reduced fear memory as proposed by the habituation model, but could signal mental detachment, leading to suboptimal treatment outcomes. Our results corroborated our hypotheses: individuals with escalating amygdala responses during exposure exhibited better clinical progress, while those showing amygdala  habituation benefited less. Our results strengthen the case for the inhibitory learning model and highlight that therapy may not aim to diminish fear per se but rather to engage patients in active processing and association formation.",

    "abstract": "The diversity of germ cell developmental strategies has been well documented across many vertebrate clades. However, much of our understanding of avian primordial germ cell (PGC) specification and differentiation has derived from only one species, the chicken (Gallus gallus). Of the three major classes of birds, chickens belong to Galloanserae, representing less than 4% of species, while nearly 95% of extant bird species belong to Neoaves. This represents a significant gap in our knowledge of germ cell development across avian species, hampering efforts to adapt genome editing and reproductive technologies developed in chicken to other birds. We therefore applied single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate inter-species differences in germ cell development between chicken and zebra finch (Taeniopygia castanotis), a Neoaves songbird species and a common model of vocal learning. Analysis of early embryonic male and female gonads revealed the presence of two distinct early germ cell types in zebra finch and only one in chicken. Both germ cell types expressed zebra finch Germline Restricted Chromosome (GRC) genes, present only in songbirds among birds. One of the zebra finch germ cell types expressed the canonical PGC markers, as did chicken, but with expression differences in several signaling pathways and biological processes. The second zebra finch germ cell cluster was marked by proliferation and fate determination markers, indicating beginning of differentiation. Notably, these two zebra finch germ cell populations were present in both male and female zebra finch gonads as early as HH25. Using additional chicken developmental stages, similar germ cell heterogeneity was identified in the more developed gonads of females, but not males. Overall, our study demonstrates a substantial heterochrony in zebra finch germ cell development compared to chicken, indicating a richer diversity of avian germ cell developmental strategies than previously known.",

    "abstract": "The fruit fly Drosophila is a major discovery platform in the biology of ageing due to its balance of relatively short lifespan and relatively complex physiology and behaviour. Previous studies have suggested that some important phenotypes of ageing, for instance increasingly fragmented sleep, are shared from humans to Drosophila and can be useful measures of behavioural change with age: these phenotypes therefore hold potential as readouts of healthy ageing for genetic or pharmacological interventions aimed at the underpinning biology of ageing. However, some age-related phenotypes in Drosophila show differing results among studies, leading to questions regarding the source of discrepancies among experiments. In this study, I have tested females and males from three common laboratory strains of Drosophila to determine the extent to which sex and background strain influence age-related behavioural changes in sleep and activity patterns. Surprisingly, I find that some phenotypes - including age-related changes in total activity, total sleep, and sleep fragmentation - depend strongly on sex and strain, to the extent that some phenotypes show opposing age-related changes in different sexes or strains. Conversely, I identify other phenotypes, including age-related decreases in morning and evening anticipation, that are more uniform across sexes and strains. These results reinforce the importance of controlling for background strain in both behavioural and ageing experiments, and they imply that caution should be used when drawing conclusions from studies on a single sex or strain of Drosophila. At the same time, these findings also offer suggestions for behavioural measures that merit further investigation as potentially more consistent phenotypes of ageing.",

But drug promiscuity also presents a promise: if a drug targets numerous proteins, each interaction may contribute to its therapeutic efficacy. The ability to target multiple genes is especially promising for medicines that treat systemic diseases, including neurological disorders and cancers, which result from gene network problems.

However, when sequences emerge during neurodevelopment remains unknown. We demonstrate that structured firing sequences are present in spontaneous activity of human brain organoids and ex vivo neonatal brain slices from the murine somatosensory cortex. We observed a balance between temporally rigid and flexible firing patterns that are emergent phenomena in human brain organoids and early postnatal murine somatosensory cortex, but not in primary dissociated cortical cultures. Our findings suggest that temporal sequences do not arise in an experience-dependent manner, but are rather constrained by an innate preconfigured architecture established during neurogenesis. These findings highlight the potential for brain organoids to further explore how exogenous inputs can be used to refine neuronal circuits and enable new studies into the genetic mechanisms that govern assembly of functional circuitry during early human brain development.",

The nBAF complex facilitates promoter-proximal Pol2 pausing, signal-dependent Pol2 recruitment (loading), and importantly, mediates productive elongation in the gene body via interaction with the elongation complex and elongation-competent Pol2. Mechanistically, Pol2 elongation is mediated by activity-induced nBAF assembly (especially, ARID1A recruitment) and its ATPase activity. Together, our data demonstrate that the nBAF complex regulates several aspects of Pol2 transcription and reveal mechanisms underlying activity-induced Pol2 elongation. These findings may offer insights into human maladies etiologically associated with mutational interdiction of BAF functions.",

    "abstract": "Usher syndrome is the leading genetic cause of deafblindness, affecting hundreds of thousands of people worldwide. The deafness can be addressed with hearing aids or cochlear implants, but there is currently no treatment for the vision loss, which is due to progressive degeneration of retinal photoreceptors. Studies in animal models of Usher syndrome have shown that photoreceptor degeneration is exacerbated by exposure to bright light, and other studies have shown that light-induced photostress reduces mitochondrial function. We previously synthesized hexafluoro and showed that it is a potent Sirt3 activator that promotes mitochondrial respiration. Here we examined the efficacy of hexafluoro as a potential therapeutic for treatment of vison loss in a zebrafish model of Usher syndrome type 1F, which exhibits early and severe vision defects along with vestibular dysfunction as seen in Usher type 1 pathology. We find that hexafluoro improves visual function, reduces photoreceptor degeneration, and protects the retina against exposure to bright light in this USH1F model.",

    "abstract": "A long-standing question in mammalian embryology is whether regional differences of oocyte composition matter for the properties of blastomeres receiving those regions after fertilization. A hitherto untested hypothesis is that allocation depends on the orientation of 1st cleavage. However, the orientation is influenced by the site of sperm entry, which can be almost anywhere on the membrane of oocytes when these are inseminated. This variability undermines consistency and reproducibility of studies. Therefore, we harnessed the intracytoplasmic sperm injection to impose the site of fertilization in three specific ooplasmic regions (animal pole, vegetal pole, equator) in mice. Notwithstanding this categorical distinction, after 1st cleavage, the sister blastomeres differed from each other nearly the same way, as measured by gene expression and twin blastocysts formation following 2-cell embryo splitting. We reasoned that either the oocyte territories did not matter, or their effect was obscured by other factors. To shed light on these possibilities, we immobilized the oocytes on the micromanipulation stage during sperm injection and for 24 h thereafter. Imaging revealed that the orientation of 1st cleavage, instead of varying with the fertilization site, followed the shorter diameter of the unfertilized oocyte. This led in most cases to the segregation of animal and vegetal hemispheres into the sister blastomeres of 2-cell embryos. Since one blastomere received more of the animal materials and the other blastomere more of the vegetal materials, this offers a rationale to explain the distinct properties of monozygotic twins derived from 2-cell embryos in mice.",

    "abstract": "Eosinophilic meningitis caused by Angiostrongylus cantonensis is an emerging infectious disease in mainland China. The invasive snail (Pomacea canaliculata) is one of the main intermediate host of the zoonotic nematode. To gain insights into the spatial distribution, phenotypic variation and dispersal pattern of the snail populations. A field survey was conducted using modified nested sampling and selecting ditches as the main habitats. Snail distribution and abundance were displayed with predictions based on an inverse distance-weighted model. Correlation and spatial autocorrelation were analyzed among the measured parameters. The findings of this study demonstrate the well-established and abundant presence of P. canaliculata in ditches. A total of 564 sampling sites were assessed, with measurements taken on 10,145 snails having shell heights greater than 1.5 cm. The average population density was determined to be 20.31 {+/-} 11.55 snails per square meter. Morphological analysis revealed an average snail body mass of 8.93 {+/-} 3.95 g, shell height of 3.38 {+/-} 0.66 cm, a sex ratio of 2.39 {+/-} 1.01 female to male, and a shell color ratio of 9.34 {+/-} 7.52 brown to yellow. Among these measurements, body mass was found to be significantly correlated with shell height (r = 0.88, p < 0.01) and shell color (r = 0.55, p < 0.05). Spatial-correlation analysis proved that shell height was the only factor significantly spatially autocorrelated (MI = 0.27, z = 2.20, p = 0.03), although weak autocorrelations appeared in body mass and shell color. The observed geographic variations of phenotypic traits indicated a human-mediated evolving process of the snail populations and a potential complexity of the parasite transmission system. These findings may enhance the assessment of the epidemiological health risk posed by angiostrongyliasis and inform strategies for controlling infectious snails.",

    "abstract": "Soil bacteria of the order of the Rhizobiales associate symbiotically with legume plants. Particulary, Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens is a nitrogen-fixing symbiont of soybean, that helps to improve grain quality among other benefits. This bacterium possess two flagellar systems, which enable it to swim in water-saturated pores. However, the motility of B. diazoefficiens, which may be crucial for its competitiveness in root nodulation, has not been well understood. To address this knowledge gap, we designed and fabricated microfluidic soil-on-a-chip (SOC) devices that offer sustainable agriculture an original tool for directly visualizing bacterial behavior in confined-environments. Using these microdevices, we measured the population velocities and changes of direction along their paths for two strains of B. diazoefficiens, namely the wild-type and a mutant with only one flagellar system. Our detailed statistical analysis revealed that both strains exhibited reduced speeds and increased changes of direction of 180{degrees}, in channels of decreasing microscopic cross sectional area, down to a few microns. Interestingly, while the wild-type strain displayed faster swimming speeds in unconfined spaces, this advantage was negated in the SOCs that mimicked porous soils. Moreover, we employed the measured motility parameters to model and simulate B. diazoefficiens motion in SOC devices for extended periods and larger scales, enabling further predictions of diffusion in real soils. Thanks to miniaturization, microfabrication, and multidisciplinary knowledge, this study represents a significant breakthrough in soil bacteria field and methods, useful both for farmers and environment. Furthermore, the potential applications of this work extend to multiple beneficial bacteria widely used as biofertilizers.",

    "abstract": "Wolfram Syndrome 1 is an inherited condition manifesting in childhood-onset diabetes mellitus and progressive optic nerve atrophy, variable hearing impairment/deafness, diabetes insipidus, neurologic defects and other psychiatric abnormalities. The causative gene is WFS1, which encodes for a master regulator of several cellular responses, named Wolframin. As over 200 mutations have been reported in association with a great clinical variability, a convincing genotype-phenotype correlation is crucial to deal with disease severity and identify effective therapy. Herein, we investigate a patient carrying the WFS1 mutations c.316-1G>A and c.757A>T. By using iPSC-derived pancreatic {beta} cells from this patient, we demonstrated that the allele carrying the acceptor splice site (ASS) mutation c.316-1G>A originates premature termination codon (PTC)-containing splicing variants, and two ORF-conserving mRNAs leading to N-terminally truncated polypeptides. We found that degradation of PTC-carrying transcripts is regulated by nonsense mediated decay (NMD) and inflammatory stress-induced changes in NMD-related genes result in over-expression of these aberrant WFS1 mRNAs, predisposing {beta} cells to unfolded protein response-independent apoptosis. Following Cas9-mediated recovering of ASS, we retrieved the canonical transcriptional landscape and rescued normal phenotype in patient-derived {beta} cells. Overall, our study provides a model for the characterization of WFS1 mutations, uncovering new therapeutic targets for this rare disease.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear mitochondrial DNA segments (NUMTs) are pervasive elements of eukaryotic genomes. This study focuses on Ellobius talpinus and Ellobius lutescens, for which we assembled full mitochondrial DNA sequences. Our study identified NUMTs encompassing approximately 0.0052% and 0.0086% of genome assembly length in E. talpinus and E. lutescens, respectively. These NUMTs collectively spanned a total length of 122,294 bp in E. talpinus and 194,875 bp in E. lutescens. Notably, the majority of NUMTs in both species were short, with lengths of less than 500 bp. In E. talpinus, the data indicated the presence of comparatively recent NUMT insertions. More than half of the NUMTs in each species are organized into clusters, primarily situated in intergenic regions or within introns. RNA genes are the most frequently occurring fragments within these NUMTs. Furthermore, our analysis identified LINE, SINE, and LTR retrotransposons within and flanking NUMT clusters. Our results demonstrate the intricate dynamics of NUMT integration and distribution in Ellobius species and provide insights into their genomic architecture and evolutionary history.

    "abstract": "Recombinant gonadotropins, follicle stimulating (rFSH) and luteinizing hormone (rLH), offer the potential to induce gametogenesis in prepubertal fish. This study aimed to determine the in vivo effect of Argyrosomus regius rFSH (arrFSH) and Argyrosomus regius rLH (arrLH) administered to prepubertal meagre juveniles at the initial stages of sex differentiation. Meagre single-chain recombinant gonadotropins, arrFSH and arrLH were produced with the CHO expression system by Rara Avis Biotec, S. L. Juvenile meagre, 9-months old with mean weight of 222 {+/-} 36 g (mean {+/-} SD) were randomly distributed into seven experimental groups (n = 8 per group) that were treated weekly for three weeks with an acute injection of 6, 12 or 18 g kg-1 of arrFSH (groups, 6-arrFSH, 12-arrFSH and 18-arrFSH) or 6, 12 or 18 g kg-1 of arrLH (groups, 6-arrLH, 12-arrLH and 18-arrLH) or saline solution (Control group). Two more groups (n=8) were set up and treated for 6 weeks, with 12 g kg-1 of arrFSH or saline Control. The fish were held in a 10 m3 tank with natural photoperiod (Feb. - March) and temperature 16.1 {+/-} 0.4{degrees}C. At the start of the experiment (n = 8) and end of the three week experiment all fish were sacrificed and gonads dissected. Gonads were weighed, fixed in Bouins solution and processed for histological analysis. Blood was sampled from all fish at the start and end of the experiment (week 3 and 6) for 17{beta}-estradiol (E2) and 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) analysis. Juvenile meagre at the start of the experiment were in the initial stages of sexual differentiation, indicated by the presence of the ovarian or testes lumen that was surrounded by undifferentiated embryonic germ stem cells and somatic cells. At the end of the experiment, there was no significant difference in gonadosomatic index (GSI) amongst control (initial and saline treated) and the experimental groups. After three weeks of application of arrFSH, arrLH or saline all fish presented a similar gonadal structure as at the start of the experiment. However, the incidence of isolated developing germ cells (principally spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids, but also perinucleolar stage oocytes) generally increased in arrGTH treated meagre. A mean of 44 % of meagre treated with arrFSH or arrLH presented isolate developing germ cells, mainly male cells. Plasma steroid levels of E2 decreased significantly from the start of the experiments to the end. At the end of the experiment there were no differences in plasma E2 amongst Control fish and rGTH treated fish. Plasma 11-KT showed no change from the start of the experiment to week 3. However, a significant increase was observed in the arrFSH group after six weeks of treatment compared to the start of the experiment and the control group on week 6. The application of arrFSH or arrLH to meagre at the initial stages of sex differentiation did not stimulate steroid production until week six and had a limited, but evident effect on the development of isolated germ cells. The rGTHs, arrFSH or arrLH did not stimulate large developmental changes in undifferentiated gonads.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSExogenous recombinant gonadotropins administered to meagre did not advance sexual differentiation.\n\nExogenous recombinant gonadotropins administered to meagre did not affect plasma estradiol.\n\nExogenous recombinant FSH increased the proportion of meagre with isolated male germ cells.\n\nExogenous recombinant FSH increased plasma 11-ketotestosterone in meagre treated for 6 weeks.",

However, a possible role of PANX1 in cardiomyocytes in the progression of heart failure has not yet been investigated. We generated a novel mouse line with constitutive deletion of PANX1 in cardiomyocytes (Panx1MyHC6). PANX1 deletion in cardiomyocytes had no effect on unstressed heart function but increased the glycolytic metabolism both in vivo and in vitro. In vitro, treatment of H9c2 cardiomyocytes with isoproterenol led to PANX1-dependent release of ATP and Yo-Pro-1 uptake, as assessed by pharmacological blockade with spironolactone and siRNA-mediated knock-down of PANX1. To investigate non-ischemic heart failure and the preceding cardiac hypertrophy we administered isoproterenol, and we demonstrate that Panx1MyHC6 mice were protected from systolic and diastolic left ventricle volume increases and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Moreover, we found that Panx1MyHC6 mice showed decreased isoproterenol-induced recruitment of immune cells (CD45+), particularly neutrophils (CD11b+, Ly6g+), to the myocardium. Together these data demonstrate that PANX1 deficiency in cardiomyocytes impacts glycolytic metabolism and protects against cardiac hypertrophy in non-ischemic heart failure at least in part by reducing immune cell recruitment. Our study implies PANX1 channel inhibition as a therapeutic approach to ameliorate cardiac dysfunction in heart failure patients.",

The aim of this study was to determine concentrations of ghrelin, PYY, and GLP-1 in older adults exhibiting an anorexia of ageing phenotype. Thirteen older adults with healthy appetite (OA-HA; 8f, 75{+/-}7 years, 26.0{+/-}3.2 kg{middle dot}m-2), fifteen older adults with low appetite (OA-LA; 10f, 72{+/-}7 years, 23.6{+/-}3.1 kg{middle dot}m-2), and twelve young adults (YA; 6f, 22{+/-}2 years, 24.4{+/-}2.0 kg{middle dot}m-2) completed the study. Healthy appetite and low appetite were determined based on BMI, habitual energy intake, self-reported appetite, and laboratory-assessed ad libitum lunch intake. Participants provided a fasted measure of subjective appetite and blood sample (0 minutes) before consuming a standardised breakfast (450 kcal). Appetite was measured every 30 minutes for 240 minutes and blood was sampled at 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 minutes. At 240 minutes, an ad libitum lunch meal was consumed. Relative energy intake at lunch (expressed as percentage of estimated total energy requirement) was lower for OA-LA (19.8{+/-}7.7%) compared with YA (41.5{+/-}9.2%, p<0.001) and OA-HA (37.3{+/-}10.0%, p<0.001).

GLP-1 concentration was higher for OA-LA compared with YA at 180 minutes (5.00{+/-}4.71 pM vs. 1.07{+/-}2.83 pM, p=0.040). Net AUC for PYY response to feeding was greater for OA-LA compared with OA-HA (p=0.052). No differences were seen in subjective appetite. These observations in older adults exhibiting an anorexia of ageing phenotype suggest augmented anorexigenic responses of gut hormones to feeding may be causal mechanisms of anorexia of ageing.",

Given a suite of models, fitting to data selects an optimal one, thus identifying a probable transcriptional mechanism. Whilst attractive, the utility of this methodology remains unclear. Here, we sample steady-state, single-cell mRNA count distributions from parameters in the physiological range, and show they cannot be used to confidently estimate the number of inactive gene states, i.e. the number of rate-limiting steps in transcriptional initiation. Distributions from over 99% of the parameter space generated using models with 2, 3, or 4 inactive states can be well fit by one with a single inactive state. However, we show that if the mRNA lifetime is hours long, then for many minutes following induction, the increase in the mean mRNA count obeys a power law whose exponent equals the sum of the number of states visited from the initial inactive state to the active state and the number of rate-limiting post-transcriptional processing steps. Our study shows that non-linear regression estimation of the exponent from eukaryotic data is sufficient to estimate the total number of regulatory steps in transcription initiation, splicing, and nuclear export.",

    "abstract": "Auditory learning is supported by long-term changes in the neural processing of sound. We mapped neural sensitivity to timbre, pitch and location in animals trained to discriminate the identity of artificial vowels based on their spectral timbre in a two-alternative forced choice (T2AFC, n=3, female ferrets) or to detect changes in fundamental frequency or timbre of repeating artificial vowels in a go/no-go task (n=2 female ferrets). Neural responses were recorded under anaesthesia in two primary cortical fields and two tonotopically organised non-primary fields. Responses were compared these data to that of naive control animals. We observed that in both groups of trained animals the overall sensitivity to sound timbre was reduced across three cortical fields but enhanced in non-primary field PSF. Neural responses in trained animals were able to discriminate vowels that differed in either their first or second formant frequency unlike control animals whose sensitivity was mostly driven by changes in the second formant. Neural responses in the T2AFC animals, who were required to generalise across pitch when discriminating timbre, became less modulated by fundamental frequency, while those in the go/no-go animals were unchanged relative to controls. Finally, both trained groups showed increased spatial sensitivity and altered tuning. Trained animals showed an enhanced representation of the midline, where the speaker was located in the experimental chamber. Overall, these results demonstrate training elicited widespread changes in the way in which auditory cortical neurons represent complex sounds with changes in how both task relevant and task-irrelevant features were represented.",

    "abstract": "A theory and neurocomputational model are presented that explain grid cell responses as the byproduct of equally dissimilar hippocampal memories. On this account, place and grid cells are not best understood as providing a navigational system. Instead, place cells represent memories that are conjunctions of both spatial and non-spatial attributes, and grid cells primarily represent the non-spatial attributes (e.g., odors, surface texture, etc.) found throughout the two-dimensional recording enclosure. Place cells support memories of the locations where non-spatial attributes can be found (e.g., positions with a particular odor), which are arranged in a hexagonal lattice owing to memory encoding and consolidation processes (pattern separation) as applied to situations in which the non-spatial attributes are found at all locations of a two-dimensional surface. Grid cells exhibit their spatial firing pattern owing to feedback from hippocampal place cells (i.e., a hexagonal pattern of remembered locations for the non-spatial attribute represented by a grid cell). The model explains: 1) grid fields that appear to be centered outside the box; 2) the toroidal nature of grid field representations; 3) grid field alignment with the enclosure borders; 4) modules in which grid cells have the same orientation and spacing but different phases; 5) head direction conjunctive grid cells that become simple head direction cells in the absence of hippocampal feedback; 6) the instant existence of grid fields in a novel environment; 7) the slower learning of place cells; 8) the manner in which head direction sensitivity of place cells changes near borders and in narrow passages; 9) the kinds of changes that underlie remapping of place cells; and 10) grid-like responses for two-dimensional coordinate systems other than navigation.",

Despite numerous experiments with many innovative scoring functions, a good scoring function for docking remains elusive. Deep learning models offer alternatives to using explicit empirical or mathematical functions for scoring protein-protein complexes. In this study, we perform a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art scoring functions by considering the most popular and highly performant approaches for scoring protein-protein complexes, evaluating their strengths and weaknesses to aid researchers in understanding progress made in this field.

Computational tools could help to find such RNA sequences but they are often limited in their formulation of the search space. In this work, we propose partial RNA design, a novel RNA design paradigm that addresses the limitations of current RNA design formulations. Partial RNA design describes the problem of designing RNAs from arbitrary RNA sequences and structure motifs with multiple design goals. By separating the design space from the objectives, our formulation enables the design of RNAs with variable lengths and desired properties, while still allowing precise control over sequence and structure constraints at individual positions. Based on this formulation, we introduce a new algorithm, libLEARNA, capable of efficiently solving different constraint RNA design tasks. A comprehensive analysis of various problems, including a realistic riboswitch design task, reveals the outstanding performance of libLEARNA and its robustness.",

    "abstract": "Mycena citricolor is a fungus that causes the American Leaf Spot (ALS) disease in multiple hosts, including coffee and avocado. This hemibiotroph penetrates the plant through damage induced by oxalic acid. This can cause 20-90% crop losses in coffee depending on the environmental and production conditions. M. citricolor is the only known pathogenic species in the Mycena genus, a large group of saprophytic mushrooms. Comparing the saprophytic and pathogenic genomes can allow us to identify genetic machinery associated with the pathogens genome-wide functional acquisitions to cause disease.\n\nTo identify pathogenicity-related genes in M. citricolor, we analysed protein family copy-number variation, secretome prediction, and homology to known virulence factors in two M. citricolor assemblies, including a newly assembled and annotated long-read genome. We found that the pathogenic M. citricolor had a higher proportion of secreted genes expanded in copy-number, and expanded gene copies homologous to known virulence factors than the saprophytic Mycena. We shortlisted over 300 candidate genes in each M. citricolor assembly. Focusing on genes strongly regulated during plant interaction, we found over 100 candidates, primarily from multiple copies (up to 4-3 times) of 42 well-known virulence factors (e.g. MFS1, CUTA, NoxA/B, OLE1, NorA), plus a few clade-specific uncharacterised genes.\n\nM. citricolor transition to a pathogenic lifestyle reflected genome-wide functional changes. M. citricolor seems to primarily depend on well-known virulence factors in large copy numbers, suggesting the molecular plant-interaction processes involved are like those of better-studied fungi. Hypothetically, the development of ALS resistance could mirror studied responses to these virulence factors.",

Here we report a highly contiguous hexaploid genome assembly for the key wheat breeding parent Zhou8425B, an elite 1BL/1RS translocation line with durable adult plant resistance (APR) against rust diseases. By using HiFi and Hi-C sequencing reads, a 14.75 Gb genome assembly, with contig N50 and scaffold N50 values reaching 70.94 and 735.11 Mb, respectively, was developed. Comparison with 16 previously sequenced common wheat cultivars revealed unique chromosomal structural features in Zhou8425B. Notably, the 1RS translocation in Zhou8425B was apparently longer and carried more genes encoding AP2/ERF-ERF and B3 transcription factors relative to its counterpart in several genome sequenced 1BL/1RS varieties and rye lines. Aided by Zhou8425B genome assembly, a new APR locus (i.e., YrZH3B) against yellow rust (YR) disease was finely mapped to a 1 - 2 Mb interval on chromosome 3BS. Analysis with 212 Zhou8425B derivative varieties showed that pyramiding of YrZH3B with two other APR loci (YrZH22 and YrZH84) significantly decreased YR severity and enhanced grain yield, with triple combination (YrZH3B/YrZH22/YrZH84) having the highest effects. Our data demonstrate the high value of Zhou8425B assembly in studying wheat genome and agronomically important genes.",

Our results showed that the Mozabite Berbers derived their ancestry from the Middle East, Europe, and sub-Saharan Africa (global ancestry). Furthermore, we found that the population origin of ancestry varied considerably along chromosomes. More specifically, we observed variance in ancestry along chromosome 2 (local ancestry), in the genomic region containing the common genetic polymorphisms associated with lactase persistence, a trait known to be under strong positive selection. This finding indicates that the demographic process of admixture has influenced patterns of allelic variation in addition to natural selection. Overall, the AncestryGrapher toolkit facilitates the exploration, interpretation, and reporting of ancestry patterns in human populations.\n\nAvailability and implementationThe AncestryGrapher toolkit is free and open source on https://github.com/alisi1989/RFmix2-Pipeline-to-plot.",

    "abstract": "Understanding breast cancer drug response mechanism can play a crucial role in improving the treatment outcomes and survival rates. Existing bioinformatics-based approaches are far from perfect and do not adopt computational methods based on advanced artificial intelligence concepts. Therefore, we introduce a novel computational framework based on an efficient version of support vector machines (esvm) working as follows. First, we downloaded and processed three gene expression datasets related to breast cancer responding and non-responding to the treatments from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) according to the following GEO accession numbers: GSE130787, GSE140494, and GSE196093. Our method esvm is formulated as a constrained optimization problem in the dual form as a function of {lambda}. We recover the importance of each gene as a function of{lambda} , y, and x. Then, we select p genes out of n, provided as input to enrichment analysis tools, Enrichr and Metascape. Compared to existing baseline methods, results demonstrate superiority and efficiency of esvm achieving high performance results and having more expressed genes in (1) well-established breast cancer cell lines including MD-MB231, MCF7, and HS578T; and (2) breast tissues. Moreover, esvm is able to identify (1) various drugs including clinically approved ones (e.g., tamoxifen and erlotinib); (2) seventy-four unique genes (including tumor suppression genes such as TP53 and BRCA1); and (3) thirty-six unique TFs (including SP1 and RELA). These results have been reported to be linked to breast cancer drug response mechanism, progression, and metastasizing.

Leveraging a comprehensive dataset of manually curated annotations for the human protein complexome, we investigated biological perturbations at the protein complex level. Using proteomics and transcriptomics data from fibroblasts of patients with inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) and control samples, we globally mapped information onto complex subunits to discern affected processes.\n\nAcross the patient cohort (consisting of organic acidaemias, fatty acid oxidation defects and mitochondrial respiratory chain defect IEMs), mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation emerged as the most perturbed pathway, identified through proteomics datasets. Simultaneously, metabolomics highlighted significant regulation of phospholipids in patients with Fatty Acid and Mitochondrial IEM. Moreover, proteomics analysis also revealed the dysregulation of protein complexes involved in histone (de)acetylation, a finding validated through Western Blot analysis measuring histone acetylation levels. This introduces a novel epigenetic dimension to IEM and metabolic research, suggesting avenues for further exploration.\n\nOur study demonstrates a multiomics data integration concept that maps proteomics and transcriptomics data onto model organism complexomes. This integrative approach can be extended to metabolomics and lipidomics, associating information with complexes having metabolic functions, such as enzymatic complexes. This global strategy for identifying disease-relevant perturbations offers a systems-wide perspective on molecular-level physiological and pathological changes. Such insights are crucial for devising clinical intervention strategies and prioritizing druggable pathways and complexes.

    "abstract": "Activation of the subventricular zone (SVZ) after cerebral ischemia is one of the early responses in the brain to counteract the loss of neurons and reduce tissue damage. Impaired brain regions communicate with the SVZ through many chemotactic messages that result in neural stem cells (NSC) migration and differentiation. However, the activation of gliogenesis and the role of newborn astrocytes in the post-ischemic scenario is still under debate. We have previously shown that adenosine release after brain ischemia prompts the SVZ to generate new astrocytes. Here, we use transient brain ischemia in mice to define the cellular origin of these astrocytes in the SVZ neurogenic niche and investigate their role in the pathological process. By combining immunofluorescence, BrdU-tracing and genetic cellular labelling, we tracked the migration of newborn astrocytes, positive for the proteoglycan marker Thbs4, from the dorsal and medial SVZ to the perilesional barrier surrounding the ischemic core, termed \"glial scar\". We found that these Thbs4-positive astrocytes modulate the dense extracellular matrix at the lesion border by synthesis but also degradation of hyaluronan. We also show that while the accumulation of this polymer at the lesion is sufficient to recruit newborn astrocytes, its degradation at the SVZ correlates with gliogenesis. These results point to newborn astrocytes as a plausible pharmacological target to modulate the glial scar after brain ischemia and facilitate tissue regeneration.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTSeasonal influenza remains a serious global health problem, leading to high mortality rates among the elderly and individuals with comorbidities. It also imposes a substantial economic burden through increased absenteeism during periods of active pathogen circulation. Vaccination is generally accepted as the most effective strategy for influenza prevention. As both influenza A and B viruses circulate and cause seasonal epidemics, vaccines need to include multiple antigens derived from different viral subtypes. While current influenza vaccines are effective, they still have limitations, including narrow specificity for certain serological variants, which may result in a mismatch between vaccine antigens and circulating strains. Additionally, the rapid variability of the virus poses challenges in providing extended protection beyond a single season. Therefore, mRNA technology is particularly promising for influenza prevention, as it enables the rapid development of multivalent vaccines and allows for quick updates of their antigenic composition. mRNA vaccines have already proven successful in preventing COVID-19 by eliciting rapid cellular and humoral immune responses. In this study, we present the development of a trivalent mRNA vaccine candidates, evaluate its immunogenicity using the hemagglutination inhibition assay, and assess its efficacy in animals. We demonstrate the higher immunogenicity of the mRNA vaccine candidates compared to the inactivated split influenza vaccine and its enhanced ability to generate a cross-specific humoral immune response. These findings highlight the potential mRNA technology in overcoming current limitations of influenza vaccines and hold promise for ensuring greater efficacy in preventing seasonal influenza outbreaks.",

Lantibiotic Resistance System genes (LRS) are encoded by lantibiotic-producing bacterial strains but, we show, are also prevalent in microbiomes across human cohorts spanning vastly different lifestyles and 5 continents. Bacterial strains encoding LRS have enhanced in vivo fitness upon dietary exposure to Nisin A but reduced fitness in the absence of lantibiotic pressure. Differential binding of host derived, secreted IgA contributes to fitness discordance between bacterial strains encoding or lacking LRS. Although LRS are associated with mobile genetic elements, sequence comparisons of LRS encoded by distinct bacterial species suggest they have been long-term components of their respective genomes. Our study reveals the prevalence, abundance and physiologic significance of an underappreciated subset of antimicrobial resistance genes encoded by commensal bacterial species constituting the human gut microbiome, and provides insights that will guide development of microbiome augmenting strategies.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial vaginosis (BV), a common syndrome characterized by Lactobacillus-deficient vaginal microbiota, is associated with adverse health outcomes. BV often recurs after standard antibiotic therapy in part because antibiotics promote microbiota dominance by Lactobacillus iners instead of Lactobacillus crispatus, which has more beneficial health associations. Strategies to promote L. crispatus and inhibit L. iners are thus needed. We show that oleic acid (OA) and similar long-chain fatty acids simultaneously inhibit L. iners and enhance L. crispatus growth. These phenotypes require OA-inducible genes conserved in L. crispatus and related species, including an oleate hydratase (ohyA) and putative fatty acid efflux pump (farE). FarE mediates OA resistance, while OhyA is robustly active in the human vaginal microbiota and sequesters OA in a derivative form that only ohyA-harboring organisms can exploit. Finally, OA promotes L. crispatus dominance more effectively than antibiotics in an in vitro model of BV, suggesting a novel approach for treatment.",

    "abstract": "Aging involves a range of genetic, epigenetic, and physiological alterations. A key characteristic of aged cells is the loss of global heterochromatin, accompanied by a reduction in canonical histone levels. In this study, we track the fate of centromeres during aging in human cells. Our findings reveal that the centromeric histone H3 variant CENP-A is downregulated in aged cells, in a p53-dependent manner. We observe repression of centromeric noncoding transcription through an epigenetic mechanism via recruitment of a lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1/KDM1A) to centromeres. This suppression results in defective de novo CENP-A loading at aging centromeres. By dual inhibition of p53 and LSD1/KDM1A in aged cells, we mitigate the reduction in centromeric proteins and centromeric transcripts, leading to mitotic rejuvenation of these cells. These results offer insights into a novel mechanism for centromeric inactivation during aging and provide potential strategies to reactivate centromeres.",

However, the mechanisms and associations of phenotypic plasticity with biodiversity patterns remain unresolved. In this paper, we investigate the effect of phenotypic plasticity on adaptive evolution in the context of climatic changes and plasticity costs, specifically examining the rates of trait evolution, speciation, extinction, and diversification. We employed an eco-evolutionary agent-based model, incorporating body temperature as a plastic trait that dynamically responds to fluctuations in environmental temperature. We found the same pattern of results for both climate and plasticity cost contexts. We found that an increase in plasticity leads to a decrease in extinction and trait evolution rates, with high plasticity serving to postpone mass extinction events. Systems with plastic species experience higher speciation rates. Additionally, as plasticity increases in systems, diversification rates also increase. Our study supports the hypothesis that plasticity can facilitate adaptive evolution. It provides new insights into the effect of plasticity on adaptive evolution at larger scales, considering relevant mechanisms and factors such as population size, grouping, occupancy, plasticity extension, and dispersion.",

Emerging breeding techniques offer the potential to improve the precision and efficiency of plant breeding programs; however, their optimal implementation requires refinement of existing breeding programs or the design of new ones. Stochastic simulations are a cost-effective solution for testing and optimizing new breeding strategies. The aim of this paper is to provide an introduction to stochastic simulation with software AlphaSimR for plant breeding students, researchers, and experienced breeders. We present an overview of how to use the software and provide an introductory AlphaSimR vignette as well as complete AlphaSimR scripts of breeding programs for self-pollinated, clonal, and cross-pollinated plants, including relevant breeding techniques, such as backcrossing, speed breeding, genomic selection, index selection, and others. Our objective is to provide a foundation for understanding and utilizing simulation software, enabling readers to adapt the provided scripts for their own use or even develop completely new plant breeding programs. By incorporating simulation software into plant breeding education and practice, the next generation of plant breeders will have a valuable tool in their quest to provide sustainable and nutritious food sources for a growing population.",

    "abstract": "1Changes in body mass are a key indicator of health and disease in humans and model organisms. Animal body mass is routinely monitored in husbandry and preclinical studies. In rodent studies, the current best method requires manually weighing the animal on a balance which has at least two consequences. First, direct handling of the animal induces stress and can have confounding effects on studies. Second, the acquired mass is static and not amenable to continuous assessment, and rapid mass changes can be missed. A noninvasive and continuous method of monitoring animal mass would have utility in multiple areas of biomedical research. Here, we test the feasibility of determining mouse body mass using video data. We combine computer vision methods with statistical modeling to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. Our methods determine mouse mass with 4.8% error across highly genetically diverse mouse strains, with varied coat colors and mass. This error is low enough to replace manual weighing with image-based assessment in most mouse studies. We conclude that visual determination of rodent mass using video enables noninvasive and continuous monitoring and can improve animal welfare and preclinical studies.",

However, the threshold for somatic mosaicism leading to brain dysfunction is unknown. In this study, we induced various mosaic burdens in mice of focal cortical dysplasia type II (FCD II), featuring mTOR somatic mosaicism and spontaneous behavioral seizures. Mosaic burdens ranged from approximately 1,000 to 40,000 neurons expressing the mTOR mutant in the somatosensory (SSC) or medial prefrontal (PFC) cortex. Surprisingly, just [~]8,000-9,000 neurons expressing the MTOR mutant were sufficient to trigger epileptic seizures. Mutational burden correlated with seizure frequency and onset, with a higher tendency for electrographic inter-ictal spikes and beta- and gamma-frequency oscillations in FCD II mice exceeding the threshold. Moreover, mutation-negative FCD II patients in deep sequencing of their bulky brain tissues revealed somatic mosaicism of mTOR pathway genes as low as 0.07% in resected brain tissues through ultra-deep targeted sequencing (up to 20 million reads). Thus, our study suggests that extremely low levels of somatic mosaicism can contribute to brain dysfunction.",

Empirical identification of translated smORFs is carried out primarily using ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq). While effective, published Ribo-seq datasets can vary drastically in quality and different analysis tools are frequently employed. Here, we examine the impact of these factors on identifying translated smORFs. We compared five commonly used software tools that assess ORF translation from Ribo-seq (RibORFv0.1, RibORFv1.0, RiboCode, ORFquant, and Ribo-TISH), and found surprisingly low agreement across all tools. Only [~]2% of smORFs were called translated by all five tools and [~]15% by three or more tools when assessing the same high- resolution Ribo-seq dataset. For larger annotated genes, the same analysis showed [~]72% agreement across all five tools. We also found that some tools are strongly biased against low- resolution Ribo-seq data, while others are more tolerant. Analyzing Ribo-seq coverage as a proxy for translation levels revealed that highly translated smORFs are more likely to be detected by more than one tool. Together these results support employing multiple tools to identify the most confident microprotein-coding smORFs, and choosing the tools based on the quality of the dataset and planned downstream characterization experiments of predicted smORFs.",

    "abstract": "Tandem repeats can play an important role in centromere structure, subtelomeric regions, DNA methylation, recombination, and the regulation of gene activity. There is a growing need for bioinformatics tools that can visualize and explore chromosome-scale repeats. Here we present RepeatOBserver, a new tool for visualizing tandem repeats and clustered transposable elements and for identifying potential natural centromere locations, using a Fourier transform of DNA walks: https://github.com/celphin/RepeatOBserverV1. RepeatOBserver can identify a broad range of repeats (3-20, 000bp long) in genome assemblies without any a priori knowledge of repeat sequences or the need for optimizing parameters. RepeatOBserver allows for easy visualization of the positions of both perfect and imperfect repeating sequences across each chromosome. We use RepeatOBserver to compare DNA walks, repeat patterns and centromere positions across genome assemblies in a wide range of well-studied species (e.g., human, mouse-ear cress), crops, and non-model organisms (e.g., fern, yew). Analyzing 107 chromosomes with known centromere positions, we find that centromeres consistently occur in regions that have the least diversity in repeat types (i.e. one or a few repeated sequences are present in very high numbers). Taking advantage of this information, we use a genomic Shannon diversity index to predict centromere locations in several other chromosome-scale genome assemblies. The Fourier spectra produced by RepeatOBserver can help visualize historic centromere positions, potential neocentromeres, retrotransposon clusters and gene copy variation. Identification of patterns of split and inverted tandem repeats at inversion boundaries suggests that at least some chromosomal inversions or misassemblies can be predicted with RepeatOBserver. RepeatOBserver is therefore a flexible tool for comprehensive characterization of tandem repeat patterns that can be used to visualize and identify a variety of regions of interest in genome assemblies.",

Several families of sequence-specific SRFs are known to be similarly ancient.

We learn models the predict SS locations with 83-86% accuracy in fish, insects and plants, and about 70% in mammals. Learned SRE motifs include both known SRF binding motifs as well as novel motifs, and both classes are supported by genetic analyses.

This study aimed to validate the hypothesis that the iPhone 13-Pro camera, in conjunction with its LiDAR technology, can accurately extract information such as the surface area of maize leaves (Zea mays). 3D point cloud models enabled remote, non-destructive trait data collection, and four methods for 3D canopy area extraction were compared to assess their relation with wole-plant transpiration rates. The experimental findings demonstrated a robust correlation (R^2=0.88, RMSE=62.45) between manually scanned surface area and the iPhone 3-dimentional estimated plant surface area. Furthermore, the study revealed that the ratio of stem to total plant surface area is 11.6% (R^2=0.91, RMSE=30.20). Utilizing this ratio for predicting canopy surface area from total plant surface area resulted in a significant correlation (R^2=0.89) with the measured canopy. The mobile iPhones surface area measurement tool offers a significant advantage by providing the capability to scan the entire plant surface area. This contrasts with the projected leaf area index measurements taken by most commercial top canopy scanners, which are unable to penetrate the canopy like manual measurements do. An additional advantage of the real size surface measurement of the whole canopy is its high correlation (R^2=0.83) with the whole canopy transpiration rate, as was measured using a gravimetric system on the same scanned plants.

An important case is cell-cell communication, where cellular metabolites are secreted into the microenvironment and initiate a signaling cascade by binding to an intra- or extracellular receptor of another cell.

Here we report MetalinksDB, a comprehensive and flexible database of intercellular metabolite-protein interactions that is a magnitude larger than existing ones. MetalinksDB can be tailored to specific biological contexts such as diseases, pathways, or tissue/cellular locations by querying subsets of interactions using the web interface (https://metalinks.omnipathdb.org/) or the knowledge graph adapters. We showcase the use of MetalinksDB by identifying deregulated processes in renal cancer patients from multi-omics data as well as inferring metabolite-mediated cell-cell communication events driving acute kidney injury from spatial transcriptomic data. We anticipate that MetalinksDB will facilitate the study of metabolite-mediated communication processes.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=113 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/573715v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (34K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18c78aaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@145f21borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@119d16borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3febb_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Proteinoids, or thermal proteins, produce hollow microspheres in aqueous solution. Ensembles of the microspheres produce endogenous spikes of electrical activity, similar to that of neurons. To make a first step towards evaluation of the mechanisms of such electrical behaviour we decided to expose proteinoids to chloroform. We found that while chloroform does not inhibit the electrical oscillations of proteinoids it causes substantial changes in the patterns of electrical activity. Namely, incremental chloroform exposure strongly affect proteinoid microsphere electrical activity across multiple metrics. As chloroform levels rise, the spike potential drops from 0.9 mV under control conditions to 0.1 mV at 25 mg/mL. This progressive spike potential decrease suggests chloroform suppresses proteinoid electrical activity. The time between spikes, the interspike period, follows a similar pattern. Minimal chloroform exposure does not change the average inter-spike period, while higher exposures do. It drops from 23.2 min under control experiments to 3.8 min at 25 mg/mL chloroform, indicating increased frequency of the electrical activity. These findings might leads to deeper understanding of the electrical activity of proteinoids and their potential application in the domain of bioelectronics.",

    "abstract": "Banked turn is a common flight manoeuvre observed in birds and aircraft. To initiate the turn, whereas traditional aircraft rely on the wing ailerons, most birds use a variety of asymmetric wing morphing control techniques, validated in engineered replicas, to roll their bodies and thus redirect the lift vector to the direction of the turn. Nevertheless, when searching for prey, soaring raptors execute steady banked turns without exhibiting observable wing movements apart from tail twisting around the body axis. Despite the role as a vertical stabilizer in traditional aircraft, the reasons why birds twist the tails in banked turn are still not well understood. Here, we use an avian-inspired feathered drone to find that the tail located in proximal arrangement behind the wings enters wing-induced asymmetric flow region during twisting and generates asymmetric lift that results in both roll and yaw moments sufficient to coordinate banked turns. Moreover, twisting the tail induces a nose-up pitch moment that increases the angle of attack of the wings, thereby generating more lift that compensates for losses caused by the banking motion. Flight experiments confirm the effectiveness of tail twist to control not only steady low-speed banked turns but also high-speed sharp turns by means of coordinated tail twist and pitch with asymmetric wing shape morphing. These findings contribute to the understanding of avian flight behaviours that are difficult to study in controlled laboratory settings, and provide effective control strategies for agile drones with morphing aerial surfaces.\n\nOne sentence summaryRaptor-informed feathered drone reveals that twisting the tail located at the trailing edges of the wings generates aerodynamic control forces caused by wing-induced asymmetric flow to let birds execute both steady banked turns and high-speed sharp turns.",

    "abstract": "The 3D conformations of chromosomes can encode biological significance, and its implication is being increasingly appreciated recently. Certain chromosome structural features, such as A/B compartmentalization, are frequently extracted from pairwise contact information (physical association between different regions of the genome) and compared with linear annotations of the genome, such as histone modifications and lamina association. Here, we investigate how additional properties of chromosome structure can be deduced using the abstract graph representation of the contact heatmap, and how network properties can have a better connection with some of these biological annotations. We constructed chromosome structure networks (CSNs) from bulk Hi-C data and calculated a set of site-resolved (node-based) network properties of these CSNs. We found these network properties are useful for characterizing chromosome structure features. We examined the ability of network properties in differentiating several scenarios, such as haploid vs diploid cells, partially inverted nuclei vs conventional architecture, and structural changes during cell development. We also examined the connection between network properties and a series of other linear annotations, such as histone modifications and chromatin states including poised promoter and enhancer labels. We found that semi-local network properties are more capable of characterizing genome annotations than diffusive or ultra-local node features. For example, local square clustering coefficient can be a strong classifier of lamina-associated domains (LADs), whereas a path-based network property, closeness centrality, does not vary concordantly with LAD status. We demonstrated that network properties can be useful for discerning large-scale chromosome structures that emerge in different biological situations.\n\nTOC Figure\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=135 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/573476v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (51K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@45df0forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13776daorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5c1519org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16d447f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Wolperts French flag problem conceptualizes the task of forming axial patterns with broad regions in multicellular systems. Wolpert described two different solutions to his problem, the balancing model and thresholding of a morphogen gradient, both of which require global, long-range signaling between cells. Since global signaling becomes challenging in large multicellular systems, we computationally explore alternative solutions, which use only local cell-cell signaling and are simple enough to potentially be implemented in natural or synthetic systems. We employ cellular automata rules to describe local signal processing logics, and search for rules capable of robust and tunable axial patterning with evolutionary algorithms. This yields large sets of successful rules, which however display only few types of behavior. We introduce a rule alignment and consensus procedure to identify patterning modules that are responsible for the different behaviors. With these modules as building blocks, we then construct local schemes for axial patterning, which function also in the presence of noise and growth, and for patterns with a larger number of different regions. The regulatory logic underlying these modules could therefore serve as the basis for the design of synthetic patterning systems, and as a conceptual framework for the interpretation of biological mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "To better understand and develop treatments for lung cancer, it is important to have reliable and physiologically relevant culture models. Traditional methods of growing lung cancer cells in two- dimensional (2D) monolayers have limitations in mimicking the complex architecture and microenvironment of lung tumors in vivo, limiting their value as reliably informative disease models. In this study, we introduce a new cell culture platform called \"tumoroids,\" which involves growing HCC827 lung cancer cells in three-dimensional (3D) configurations. By comparing transcriptional profiles of HCC827 cells grown as tumoroids versus the same cells grown in 2D monolayers, we investigate how cell-cell orientation and signaling impact the cancer-driving properties of lung cancer. We examine key features associated with cancer progression, such as epithelial mesenchymal transition, replicative ability, and induction of angiogenesis. Additionally, we assess the functional characteristics of the 3D tumoroid culture system by subjecting the cells to irradiation. Through comparing the gene expression profiles of the 3D tumoroid and 2D cultures with those of primary human lung adenocarcinoma, we find that the 3D tumoroid cultures more closely resemble the characteristics of primary human lung cancer. This suggests that the 3D tumoroid culture platform can serve as a valuable in vitro model for studying lung cancer, offering greater clinical relevance compared to traditional 2D cultures. Overall, this study highlights the importance of using advanced culture models like 3D tumoroids to improve our understanding of lung cancer and facilitate the development of effective treatments.",

    "abstract": "Control of cell identity and number is central to tissue function, yet principles governing organization of malignant cells in tumor tissues remain poorly understood. Using mathematical modeling and candidate-based analysis, we discover primary and metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) organize in a stereotypic pattern whereby PDAC cells responding to WNT signals (WNT-R) neighbor WNT-secreting cancer cells (WNT-S). Leveraging lineage-tracing, we reveal the WNT-R state is transient and gives rise to the WNT-S state that is highly stable and committed to organizing malignant tissue. We further show that a subset of WNT-S cells expressing the Notch ligand DLL1 form a functional niche for WNT-R cells. Genetic inactivation of WNT secretion or Notch pathway components, or cytoablation of the WNT-S state disrupts PDAC tissue organization, suppressing tumor growth and metastasis. This work indicates PDAC growth depends on an intricately controlled equilibrium of functionally distinct cancer cell states, uncovering a fundamental principle governing solid tumor growth and revealing new opportunities for therapeutic intervention.",

There are laminar flows that have glasses with an ultraviolet light filter, but many models do not have any protection against ultraviolet light. Thus, we measured the irradiance inside and outside two types of laminar flows without UV filter and with UV filter respectively. And calculated the radiation levels that a researcher could receive at one meter distance for one hour daily in a time interval of one year. Thus, we found that chronic exposure to UV radiation from laminar flow can cause health risks.
