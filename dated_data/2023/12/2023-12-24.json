    "abstract": "Interaction networks are a widely used tool to understand the dynamics of plant-pollinator ecological communities. However, while most mutualistic networks have been defined at the species level, ecological processes such as pollination take place at different scales, including the individual or patch levels. Yet, current approaches studying fine-grain sub-specific plant-pollinator networks only account for interactions among nodes belonging to a single plant species due to the conceptual and mathematical limitations of modeling simultaneously several plant species each composed of several nodes. Here, we introduce a multilayer diffusion network framework that allows modeling simple diffusion processes between nodes pertaining to the same or different layers (i.e. species). It is designed to depict from the network structure the potential conspecific and heterospecific pollen flows among plant individuals or patches. This potential pollen flow is modeled as a transport-like system, in which pollen grain movements are represented as random-walkers that diffuse on an ensemble of bipartite layers of conspecific plants and their shared pollinators. We exemplify this physical conceptualization using a dataset of nine fine-grain sub-specific plant-pollinator networks from a Mediterranean grassland of annual plants, where plant nodes represent groups of conspecifics within patches of 1m2. The diffusion networks show pollinators effectively connecting sets of patches of the same and different plant species, forming a modular structure. Interestingly, different properties of the network structure, such as the conspecific pollen arrival probability and the number of conspecific subgraphs in which plants are embedded, are critical for the seed production of different plant species. We provide a simple but robust set of metrics to calculate potential pollen flow and scale down network ecology to functioning properties at the individual or patch level, where most ecological processes take place, hence moving forward the description and interpretation of species-rich communities across scales.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSIntroductionC_ST_ABSThe ANDROMEDA software by Prosilico has previously been successfully applied and validated for predictions of absorption characteristics of small drugs in man. The influence of fat food on the gastrointestinal uptake and systemic exposure of drugs have, however, not yet been evaluated with the software.\n\nObjective and MethodologyThe main objective was to use ANDROMEDA to predict area under the plasma concentration-time curve ratios in the fed (fat food) and fasted states (AUCfed/AUCfast) for small drugs (including those marketed in 2021) and compare results with corresponding measured clinical estimates. Actual dose sizes were considered. Another objective was to compare the performance of ANDROMEDA vs physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling and simulations by The Food Effect PBPK IQ Working Group. PBPK results generated using Simcyp and GastroPlus software were based on various physicochemical, in vitro and in vivo data and a decision tree for model verification and optimization.\n\nResults and Discussion63 drugs, including 17 new drugs, with observed AUCfed/AUCfast between 0.2 and 5.5 were found and used for this evaluation. Predicted AUCfed/AUCfast had mean and maximum errors of 1.5- and 4.1-fold, respectively, and the predictive accuracy (correlation between predicted and observed AUCfed/AUCfast; Q2) was 0.3. 14 % of predictions had >2-fold error. For 72 % of drugs, food interaction class was correctly predicted. The level of predictive accuracy was overall similar to results obtained with PBPK modelling and simulations, however, with lower maximum error and higher compound coverage. With PBPK models, maximum simulation error was 7.7-fold and 3 highly lipophilic compounds were not possible to simulate.\n\nConclusionThe results validate ANDROMEDA for prediction of fat food-drug interaction size for small drugs in man. Major advantages with the methodology include that prediction results are produced directly from molecular structure and oral dose and are similar to PBPK-simulation results obtained using in vitro and clinical data. Furthermore, ANDROMEDA showed lower maximum errors and wider compound range.",

    "abstract": "Brain disturbances during development can have a lasting impact on neural function and behavior. Seizures during this critical period are linked to significant long-term consequences such as neurodevelopmental disorders, cognitive impairments, and psychiatric symptoms, resulting in a complex spectrum of multimorbidity. The hippocampus-prefrontal cortex (HPC-PFC) circuit emerges as a potential common link between such disorders. However, the mechanisms underlying these outcomes and how they relate to specific behavioral alterations are unclear. We hypothesized that specific dysfunctions of hippocampal-cortical communication due to early-life seizure would be associated with distinct behavioral alterations observed in adulthood. Here, we performed a multilevel study to investigate behavioral, electrophysiological, histopathological, and neurochemical long-term consequences of early-life Status epilepticus in male rats. We show that adult animals submitted to early-life seizure (ELS) present working memory impairments and sensorimotor disturbances, such as hyperlocomotion, poor sensorimotor gating, and sensitivity to psychostimulants despite not exhibiting neuronal loss. Surprisingly, cognitive deficits were linked to an aberrant increase in the HPC-PFC long-term potentiation (LTP) in a U-shaped manner, while sensorimotor alterations were associated with heightened neuroinflammation, as verified by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression, and altered dopamine neurotransmission. Furthermore, ELS rats displayed impaired HPC-PFC theta-gamma coordination and an abnormal brain state during active behavior resembling rapid eye movement (REM) sleep oscillatory dynamics. Our results point to impaired HPC- PFC functional connectivity as a possible pathophysiological mechanism by which ELS can cause cognitive deficits and psychiatric-like manifestations even without neuronal loss, bearing translational implications for understanding the spectrum of multidimensional developmental disorders linked to early-life seizures.",

    "abstract": "Photosynthesis in eukaryotic cells takes place in chloroplasts that develop from undifferentiated plastids in response to light. In angiosperms, after perception of light de-repression allows Elongated Hypocotyl 5 (HY5) transcription factor to initiate photomorphogenesis, and two families of transcription factors known as Golden2-like (GLK) and GATA are considered master regulators of chloroplast development. The MIR171-targeted SCARECROW-LIKE (SCL) GRAS transcription factors also impact on chlorophyll biosynthesis. The extent to which these proteins carry out conserved roles in non-seed plants is not known. Here we report in the model liverwort Marchantia polymorpha that GLK controls chloroplast biogenesis and HY5 shows a small conditional effect on chlorophyll content. In contrast, GATA and SCL have no detectable roles in this fundamental process. ChIP-SEQ and RNA-SEQ revealed that MpGLK regulates many photosynthetic and chloroplast development-related genes, but also has a broader set of targets than previously reported in angiosperms. This implies GLK carries out a conserved role relating to chloroplast biogenesis in land plants but also supports extensive divergence between its targets in M. polymorpha and flowering plants. The data support the hypothesis that regulation of chloroplast biogenesis in M. polymorpha is streamlined compared with angiosperms and allows us to present a core regulatory network for chloroplast biogenesis in land plants.",

    "abstract": "The distinct organization of Kv2 voltage-gated potassium channels on and near the cell body of brain neurons enables their regulation of action potentials and specialized membrane contact sites. Somatosensory neurons have a pseudounipolar morphology and transmit action potentials from peripheral nerve endings through axons that bifurcate to the spinal cord and the cell body within ganglia including the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Kv2 channels regulate action potentials in somatosensory neurons, yet little is known about where Kv2 channels are located. Here we define the cellular and subcellular localization of the Kv2 paralogs, Kv2.1 and Kv2.2, in DRG somatosensory neurons with a panel of antibodies, cell markers, and genetically modified mice. We find that relative to spinal cord neurons, DRG neurons have similar levels of detectable Kv2.1, and higher levels of Kv2.2. In older mice, detectable Kv2.2 remains similar while detectable Kv2.1 decreases. Both Kv2 subtypes adopt clustered subcellular patterns that are distinct from central neurons. Most DRG neurons co-express Kv2.1 and Kv2.2, although neuron subpopulations show preferential expression of Kv2.1 or Kv2.2. We find that Kv2 protein expression and subcellular localization is similar between mouse and human DRG neurons. We conclude that the organization of both Kv2 channels is consistent with physiological roles in the somata and stem axons of DRG neurons. The general prevalence of Kv2.2 in DRG as compared to central neurons and the enrichment of Kv2.2 relative to detectable Kv2.1, in older mice, proprioceptors, and axons suggest more widespread roles for Kv2.2 in DRG neurons.\n\nSignificance statementThe subcellular distribution of Kv2 voltage-gated potassium channels enable compartment-specific modulation of membrane excitability and organization of membrane contact sites. Here we identify subcellular distributions of the Kv2 paralogs, Kv2.1 and Kv2.2, in somatosensory neurons that bear similarities to and distinctions from central neurons. The distribution of Kv2 channels is similar in mouse and human somatosensory neurons. These results identify unique locations of Kv2 channels in somatosensory neurons that could enable roles in sensory information processing.",

The paper presents a comprehensive bibliometric and contextual analysis, followed by a literature review, to shed light on the vast potential of computational methods in this domain. It reveals that most existing methods focus on single biofabrication process stages and components, and there is a significant gap in approaches that utilize accurate models encompassing both biological and technological aspects. This analysis underscores the indispensable role of these methods in under-standing and effectively manipulating complex biological systems and the necessity for developing computational methods that span multiple stages and components.

    "abstract": "Tissue Engineering (TE) and Regenerative Medicine (RM) aim to replicate and replace tissues for curing disease. However, full tissue integration and homeostasis are still far from reach. Biofabrication is an emerging field that identifies the processes required for generating biologically functional products with the desired structural organization and functionality and can potentially revolutionize the regenerative medicine domain, which aims to use patients cells to restore the structure and function of damaged tissues and organs. However, biofabrication still has limitations in the quality of processes and products. Biofabrication processes are often improved empirically, but this is slow, costly, and provides partial results. Computational approaches can tap into biofabrication underused potential, supporting analysis, modeling, design, and optimization of biofabrication processes, speeding up their improvement towards a higher quality of products and subsequent higher clinical relevance. This work proposes a reinforcement learning-based computational design space exploration methodology to generate optimal in-silico protocols for the simulated fabrication of epithelial sheets. The optimization strategy relies on a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm, the Advantage-Actor Critic, which relies on a neural network model for learning. In contrast, simulations rely on the PalaCell2D simulation framework. Validation demonstrates the proposed approach on two protocol generation targets: maximizing the final number of obtained cells and optimizing the spatial organization of the cell aggregate.",

    "abstract": "Over the last decade, there has been a discussion on applying infrared laser stimulation to brain-machine interfaces, such as cochlear implants. Infrared lasers can selectively activate neural populations without introducing exogenous agents to tissues. This study presents the first demonstration that laser irradiation of the cochlea, a peripheral sensory organ, can elicit a clear behavioral auditory response. Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) were divided into two groups, each subjected to classical conditioning where a reward water delivery was predicted by either cochlear laser stimulation or sound stimulus. Laser-conditioned animals successfully learned licking behavior, with conditioned responses and behavioral properties comparable to auditory-conditioned animals. The laser-evoked response was significantly inhibited by auditory masking, and auditory-conditioned animals demonstrated stimulus generalization to laser stimulation. In a subsequent experiment, simultaneous presentation of auditory and laser stimulation induced nonlinear amplification in both auditory cortical and behavioral responses, suggesting that combining auditory and laser stimulation can enhance auditory perception beyond the effects of each stimulus alone. These findings indicate that infrared laser irradiation of the cochlea can potentially evoke and enhance auditory perception, making it a promising candidate for implementation in auditory prostheses.\n\nShort Abstract (significant statement)The last decade has seen discussions about applying infrared laser stimulation to brain-machine interfaces, such as cochlear implants, due to the capability of activating spatially selected neural populations without introducing exogenous agents to tissues.

This is accomplished by the divisome synthesis complex in coordination with numerous other division proteins--such as the essential tubulin homolog FtsZ--but the molecular mechanism of its spatiotemporal regulation remains unclear. Here, we investigate the dynamics of sPG synthesis in the model Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis using live-cell single-molecule imaging of the divisome transpeptidase PBP2B. In contrast to previous models for division, we show that there is a single population of processively-moving PBP2B molecules whose motion is driven by peptidoglycan synthesis and is not associated with FtsZ treadmilling. However, although the motions of PBP2B and FtsZ are asynchronous, we demonstrate that processive PBP2B motion is partially dependent on FtsZ treadmilling. Additionally, we provide evidence that the divisome synthesis complex is multimeric. Our results support a new model for division in B. subtilis where a multimeric synthesis complex follows a single track dependent on sPG synthesis whose activity and dynamics are asynchronous with FtsZ treadmilling.",

    "abstract": "Several hundred disease-causing mutations are currently known in domestic dogs. Breeding management is therefore required to minimize their spread. Recently, genetic methods such as direct-to-consumer testing have gained popularity; however, their effects on dog populations are unclear. Here, we aimed to evaluate the influence of genetic testing on the frequency of mutations responsible for canine degenerative myelopathy (DM) and assess the changes in the genetic structure of a Pembroke Welsh corgi population from Japan. Genetic testing of 5,512 dogs for the causative mutation in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) (c.118G>A (p.E40K)) uncovered a recent decrease in frequency, plummeting from 14.5% (95/657) in 2019 to 2.9% (24/820) in 2022. Weir and Cockerham population differentiation (FST) and simulation-based genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of 117 selected dogs revealed 143 candidate SNPs for selection. The SNP with the highest FST value was located in the intron of SOD1 adjacent to the c.118G>A mutation, supporting a strong selection signature on SOD1. Further genome-wide SNP analyses revealed no obvious changes in inbreeding levels and genetic diversity between the 2019 and 2022 populations. Our study highlights that genetic testing can help inform improved mating choices in breeding programs to reduce the frequency of risk variants and avoid inbreeding. This combined strategy could decrease the genetic risk of canine DM, a fatal disease, within only a few years.\n\nSignificance statementGenetic breeding methods using direct-to-consumer testing have gained popularity, but their effects on dog populations remain unclear. In this study, the effect of direct-to-consumer genetic testing on SOD1 mutation, the causative element of canine degenerative myelopathy, in a domestic dog population (Pembroke Welsh corgi) from Japan was investigated. Our analyses revealed that since the expansion of genetic testing in 2019, breeders used these tests to artificially select against the SOD1 mutation, considerably decreasing its occurrence in the corgi population within only a few years (2019 versus 2022). Our study makes a substantial contribution to existing literature by providing empirical evidence that direct-to-consumer genetic testing can have rapid influence on pet genetics, noticeable in a span of 2-3 years.",

    "abstract": "In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) more than 50% of cases display autoactivation of Notch1 signaling, leading to oncogenic transformation. We have previously identified a specific chemovar of Cannabis that induces apoptosis by preventing Notch1 maturation in leukemia cells. Here, we isolated three cannabinoids from this chemovar that synergistically mimic the effects of the whole extract. Two were previously known, Cannabidiol (CBD) and Cannabidivarin (CBDV); whereas the third cannabinoid, which we termed 331-18A, was identified and fully characterized in this study. We demonstrated that these cannabinoids act through Cannabinoid receptor type 2 and TRPV1 to activate the integrated stress response pathway by depleting intracellular Ca2+. This is followed by increased mRNA and protein expression of ATF4, CHOP and CHAC1, which is hindered by inhibiting the upstream initiation factor eIF2. The increased abundance of CHAC1 prevents Notch1 maturation, thereby reducing the levels of the active Notch1 intracellular domain, and consequently decreasing cell viability and increasing apoptosis. Treatment with the three isolated molecules resulted in reduced tumor size and weight in-vivo and slowed leukemia progression in mice models.

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWA tradeoff always exists when dealing with multi-step tasks. High-level cognitive processes can find the best sequence of actions to achieve goals in uncertain environments, but they are slow and require significant computational demand. Contrarily, lower-level processing allows reacting to environmental stimuli rapidly, but with limited capacity to determine optimal actions. Through reiteration of the same task, biological organisms find the optimal tradeoff: from primitive movements, composite actions gradually emerge by creating task-specific neural structures. The two frameworks of a recent theory called \"active inference\" can capture high-level and low-level processes of human behavior, but how task specialization may occur in there terms is still unclear. Here, we compare two hierarchical strategies on a pick-and-place task: a discrete-continuous model with planning capabilities and a continuous-only model with fixed transitions. We analyze several consequences of defining movements in intrinsic and extrinsic domains. Finally, we propose how discrete actions might be encoded into continuous representations, comparing them with different motor learning phases and laying the foundations for further studies on bio-inspired task adaptation.",

Here we introduce spaTrack, a trajectory inference method using optimal transport to incorporate both transcriptomics and distance of spatial transcriptomics sequencing data into transition costs. spaTrack could construct fine spatial trajectories reflecting the true differentiation topology, as well as trace cell dynamics across multiple samples with temporal intervals. To capture the dynamic drivers, spaTrack models the cell fate as a function of expression profile along temporal intervals driven by transcription factors. Applying spaTrack, we successfully disentangle spatiotemporal trajectories of axolotl telencephalon regeneration and mouse midbrain development. Furthermore, we uncover diverse malignant lineages expanding in a primary tumor. One of the lineages with upregulated extracellular matrix organization implants to the metastatic site and subsequently colonizes to a secondary tumor. Overall, spaTrack greatly facilitates trajectory inference from spatial transcriptomics, providing insights in cell differentiation of broad areas.",

Changes in CSF composition due to inflammation can impact brain function. We recently identified an abnormal cytokine signature in embryonic CSF (eCSF) following maternal immune activation (MIA), a mouse model of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We hypothesized that MIA leads to other alterations in eCSF composition and employed untargeted metabolomics to profile changes in the eCSF metabolome in mice after inducing MIA with polyI:C. We report these data here as a resource, include a comprehensive MS1 and MS2 reference dataset, and present additional datasets comparing two mouse strains (CD-1 and C57Bl/6) and two developmental time points (E12.5 and E14.5). Targeted metabolomics further validated changes upon MIA. We show a significant elevation of glucocorticoids and kynurenine pathway related metabolites. Both pathways are relevant for suppressing inflammation or could be informative as disease biomarkers. Our resource should inform future mechanistic studies regarding the etiology of MIA neuropathology and roles and contributions of eCSF metabolites to brain development.",

Predominantly, TMs are inserted during protein translation, via a conserved mechanism centered around the Sec translocon. Our study reveals that the C-terminal TMs (cTMs) of numerous MPs across various organisms bypass this cotranslational route, necessitating an alternative posttranslational insertion strategy. We demonstrate that evolution has refined the hydrophilicity and length of these proteins C-terminal tails to optimize cTM insertion. Alterations in the C-tail sequence disrupt cTM insertion in both E. coli and human, leading to protein defects, loss of function, and genetic diseases. In E. coli, we identify YidC, a member of the widespread Oxa1 family, as the insertase facilitating cTMs insertion, with C-tail mutations disrupting the productive interaction of cTMs with YidC. Thus, MP sequences are fine-tuned for effective collaboration with the cellular biogenesis machinery, ensuring proper membrane protein folding.",

    "abstract": "Accurate protein-ligand binding poses are the prerequisites of structure-based binding affinity prediction, and also provide the structural basis for in depth lead optimization in small molecule drug design. Ligand-based modeling approaches primarily extract valuable information from the structural features of small molecules to assess their potential as drug candidates against specific targets. However, it is challenging to provide reasonable predictions of binding poses for different molecules, due to the complexity and diversity of the chemical space of small molecules. Similarity-based molecular alignment techniques can effectively narrow the search range, as structurally similar molecules are likely to have similar binding modes, with higher similarity usually correlating to higher success rates. However, molecular similarity isnt consistently high because molecules often require changes to achieve specific purposes, leading to reduced alignment precision. To address this issue, we propose a new alignment method--Z-align. This method uses topological structural information as a criterion for evaluating similarity, reducing the reliance on molecular fingerprint similarity. Our method has achieved significantly higher success rates than other methods at moderate levels of similarity. Additionally, our approach can comprehensively and flexibly optimize bond lengths and angles of molecules, maintaining high accuracy even when dealing with larger molecules. Consequently, our proposed solution helps in achieving more accurate binding poses in protein-ligand docking problems, facilitating the development of small molecule drugs.",

Using automated behavioral tracking and controlling for co-housing effects, we show that gut microbes influence the age at which bees start foraging but have no effects on the time spent in a foraging area and number of foraging trips. Moreover, the gut microbiota did not influence hallmarks of behavioral maturation such as body weight, cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profile, hypopharyngeal gland size, and the proportion of bees maturing into foragers. Overall, this study shows that the honeybee gut microbiota does not affect division of labor but rather plays an important function in controlling the onset of bee foraging.",

We employed a switching hybrid dynamics model, considering external inputs when analyzing individual behaviors. The study shows that skilled individuals, unlike intermediate players, exhibit greater regularity in their behavior, lead others to anticipate this regularity, and employ strategies to disrupt these expectations. This strategy exploits the principles of active human inference, implying that competition involves cooperation. We revealed this by analyzing both human decision-making and behavior in actual matches as discrete and continuous dynamical systems. This strategy helps policymakers adopt a new policy targeting cooperation with competitors, which would increase competitiveness in our daily lives.",

    "abstract": "Protein structure prediction with neural networks is a powerful new method for linking protein sequence, structure, and function, but structures have generally been predicted for only a single isoform of each gene, neglecting splice variants. To investigate the structural implications of alternative splicing, we used AlphaFold2 to predict the structures of more than 11,000 human isoforms. We employed multiple metrics to identify splicing-induced structural alterations, including template matching score, secondary structure composition, surface charge distribution, radius of gyration, accessibility of post-translational modification sites, and structure-based function prediction. We identified examples of how alternative splicing induced clear changes in each of these properties. Structural similarity between isoforms largely correlated with degree of sequence identity, but we identified a subset of isoforms with low structural similarity despite high sequence similarity. Exon skipping and alternative last exons tended to increase the surface charge and radius of gyration. Splicing also buried or exposed numerous post-translational modification sites, most notably among the isoforms of BAX. Functional prediction nominated numerous functional differences among isoforms of the same gene, with loss of function compared to the reference predominating. Finally, we used single-cell RNA-seq data from the Tabula Sapiens to determine the cell types in which each structure is expressed. Our work represents an important resource for studying the structure and function of splice isoforms across the cell types of the human body.",

Through in vivo single-unit recordings, optogenetic manipulations, and the application of a convolutional classifier, we examined the changes and causal effects of vH activity at different anxiety levels.\n\nResultsWe found that anxiogenic experiences activated the vH and that this activity scaled with increasing anxiety levels within the same spatial environment. We identified two processes that contributed to this scaling of anxiety-related activity: rate remapping and the successive recruitment of neurons. Moreover, optogenetic inhibition of the vH reduced anxiety across different levels, while anxiety-related activity scaling could be decoded using a convolutional classifier.\n\nConclusionsOur findings position the vH as a critical limbic region that functions as an  anxiometer by scaling its activity based on perceived anxiety levels. Our discoveries go beyond the traditional theory of cognitive maps in the hippocampus underlying spatial navigation and memory, by identifying hippocampal mechanisms selectively regulating anxiety.",

    "abstract": "Successful brood care requires a finely tuned interplay between caregiving parent and offspring. Cichlids are a diverse group of teleost fish known for their extensive parental care of altricial young. Female Lamprologus ocellatus lay their eggs in the protective confines of an abandoned snail shell, where they raise them to free-swimming larvae. Here we investigated whether the transition to larval independence is driven by the behavior of the mother, the offspring, or an interaction between the two. Using 3D printed shells with a window, we were able to observe the behavior of both mother and offspring inside the nest using automated object detection and tracking. We found that, once hatched, the larvae remain in the deep chambers of the shell, and at 9 dpf, actively emerge from the shell during the day. An inversion of larval phototactic behavior from dark- to light-seeking leads up to this emergence. Removal of the mother causes premature emergence of the larvae by a few days. The natural schedule (emergence at 9 dpf) is restored if the larvae are supplied with fresh water in the mothers absence. In cross-fostering experiments, we found that swapping out the mothers own clutch for older larvae forces a delay in emergence, as the foster mother prevents the larvae from leaving at 9 dpf. We conclude that larval and maternal behavior are each controlled by independent internal clocks, which, although normally synchronized, can be experimentally manipulated and brought into conflict. This study has thus revealed an innate sequence of behavioral adaptations that orchestrate brood care in shell-dwelling cichlids.",

We performed histological analyses on all tissues and assessed neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimers disease, markers of hepatic inflammation, as well as splenic mass and morphology. Additionally, we measured concentrations of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors in the plasma. We conducted RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis on bulk brain tissue and examined differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between 3xTg-AD and WT samples and across ages in each sex. We also examined DEGs between clinical Alzheimers and control parahippocampal gyrus brain tissue samples from the Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB) study in each sex.\n\nResults3xTg-AD females significantly outlived 3xTg-AD males and exhibited progressive Alzheimers neuropathology, while 3xTg-AD males demonstrated progressive hepatic inflammation, splenomegaly, circulating inflammatory proteins, and next to no Alzheimers neuropathological hallmarks. Instead, 3xTg-AD males experienced an accelerated upregulation of immune-related gene expression in the brain relative to females, further suggesting distinct inflammatory disease trajectories between the sexes. Clinical investigations revealed that 3xTg-AD brain aging phenotypes are not an artifact of the animal model, and individuals with Alzheimers disease develop similar sex-specific alterations in canonical pathways related to neuronal signaling and immune function. Interestingly, we observed greater upregulation of complement-related gene expression, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was predicted as the top upstream regulator of DEGs in diseased males of both species.\n\nConclusionsOur data demonstrate that chronic inflammation and complement activation are associated with increased mortality, revealing that age-related changes in immune response act as a primary driver of sex differences in Alzheimers disease trajectories. We propose a model of disease pathogenesis in 3xTg-AD males in which aging and transgene-driven disease progression trigger an inflammatory response, mimicking the effects of LPS stimulation despite the absence of infection.",

    "abstract": "Measuring the dynamic relationship between neuromodulators, such as dopamine, and neuronal action potentials is imperative to understand how these fundamental modes of neural signaling interact to mediate behavior. Here, we developed methods to measure concurrently dopamine and extracellular action potentials (i.e., spikes) and applied these in a monkey performing a behavioral task. Standard fast-scan cyclic voltammetric (FSCV) electrochemical (EChem) and electrophysiological (EPhys) recording systems are combined and used to collect spike and dopamine signals, respectively, from an array of carbon fiber (CF) sensors implanted in the monkey striatum. FSCV requires the application of small voltages at the implanted sensors to measure redox currents generated from target molecules, such as dopamine. These applied voltages create artifacts at neighboring EPhys-measurement sensors, producing signals that may falsely be classified as physiological spikes. Therefore, simple automated temporal interpolation algorithms were designed to remove these artifacts and enable accurate spike extraction. We validated these methods using simulated artifacts and demonstrated an average spike recovery rate of 84.5%. This spike extraction was performed on data collected from concurrent EChem and EPhys recordings made in a task-performing monkey to discriminate cell-type specific striatal units. These identified units were shown to correlate to specific behavioral task parameters related to reward size and eye-movement direction. Synchronous measures of spike and dopamine signals displayed contrasting relations to the behavioral task parameters, as taken from our small set of representative data, suggesting a complex relationship between these two modes of neural signaling. Future application of our methods will help advance our understanding of the interactions between neuromodulator signaling and neuronal activity, to elucidate more detailed mechanisms of neural circuitry and plasticity mediating behaviors in health and in disease.\n\nSignificance statementWe present a simple method for recording synchronous molecular and neuronal spike signals. Conventional electrophysiological and electrochemical instruments are combined without the need for additional hardware. A custom-designed algorithm was made and validated for extracting neuronal action potential signals with high fidelity. We were able to compute cell-type specific spike activity along with molecular dopamine signals related to reward and movement behaviors from measurements made in the monkey striatum. Such combined measurements of neurochemical and extracellular action potentials may help pave the way to elucidating mechanisms of plasticity, and how neuromodulators and neurons are orchestrated to mediate behavior.",

    "abstract": "The thymus is a primary lymphoid organ playing a crucial role in immune tolerance, by educating thymocytes through a selection mediated by thymic epithelial cells (TEC). Recent advances in gene editing and immunotherapies have made in vitro generation of iPSC-derived T cells a crucial issue with promising therapeutic applications. Current state-of-the-art approaches often fail to accurately replicate the thymic niche, resulting in impaired T cell generation, particularly for CD4+ T cells. Here we address the production of functional mature iPSc-derived TECs that are able to support in vitro T cell generation. We designed a protocol allowing iPSc differentiation into thymic epithelial progenitors (TEP) through an unbiased multifactorial method based on optimal experimental design. Modulation of signaling pathways known to regulate embryonic thymus organogenesis resulted in the obtention of TEPs expressing typical thymic markers. We achieved TEP maturation into medullary and cortical TECs by setting up a hydrogel-based 3D culture supplemented in RANK ligand, resulting in the formation of thymic organoids. To assess the functionality of the generated TECs, primary hematopoietic progenitors were co-cultured in the organoids and showed significantly improved maturation in single-positive CD4 or CD8 T cells. Remarkably, our thymic organoid model shows multilineage differentiation potential, with generation of distinct dendritic cells populations in addition to the T lineages. Thus, generation of functional TECs and thymic organoids offers a practical platform for the study of thymic cellular interactions and paves the road to future cellular therapies by producing mature thymic immune cells of clinical interest.",

    "abstract": "Invasive species pose a threat to global ecosystems and biodiversity, with the apple snail standing out as one kind of the worst invasive species due to its exclusive expansion. In order to draw a conceptual framework of its invasion pattern from an overview, we endeavor to conduct a bibliometric analysis and systematic review to explore the existing knowledge on research history and subjective categorization of Pomacea canaliculata and P. maculata, and to uncover emerging trends of distribution and possible neglected impact on food webs. The research history reveals that the first international research publication was documented in 1958. However, a substantial increase in international publications occurred only after 2000. The adoption and effective implementation of a universally agreed upon management strategy may greatly enhance the progress of research on apple snail invasion. Notably, co-word analysis revealed that the content of each thematic cluster has a shift from basic biology to the monitoring of occurrences and environmental adaptation. Currently, the global distribution of apple snails has expanded to 39 countries primarily as a result of anthropogenic translocation. All infested countries, with the exception of Israel and Singapore, are major paddy rice producers. The northernmost distribution limit is Tyumen in Russia, while the southernmost limit is the Buenos Aires Province in Argentina. Biological control has emerged as a prominent technology for the prevention of apple snail infestations, leading to the identification of 98 non-target enemy species as potential control agents. A taxonomic diversity analysis revealed that these species encompassed a wide range of phylogenetic classifications, including 6 Phyla, 12 Classes, 33 Orders, 55 Families, and 82 Genera. This observation suggests that there is a substantial pool of animals from diverse phylogenetic levels that can prey upon apple snails. Given the high population density and extensive distribution of apple snails, there is a pressing need for further research to explore their potential ecological ramifications. The current understanding of the upward ecological impacts of apple snails remains inadequate. These findings provide valuable insights for future research endeavors and contribute to the effective management of invasive apple snail populations.",

We have found that ligands activate the extranuclear pathway by a mechanism involving proton transfer. The low affinity ligand and widespread endocrine disruptor Bisphenol-A (BPA) initiated nuclear and extranuclear actions. Concentrations similar to the receptor affinity initiated the nuclear pathway, whereas much lower concentrations initiated the extranuclear pathway. Experiments in different cell types using deuterated molecules of BPA and the ER{beta} agonist, diarylpropionitrile (DPN), indicated that a proton transfer from the hydroxyl groups to an amino acid acceptor within the ligand binding domain switches the extranuclear pathway. Activation of this pathway elicited a pattern of protein interactions with ER{beta} that regulated most of the important cellular functions. Thus, the extranuclear actions of ER{beta} are initiated by a molecular mechanism different from that of nuclear actions. This mechanism may work for other ligands and nuclear receptors.",

    "abstract": "Senescent cells which are characterized by multiple features such as increased expression of SA {beta}-gal and cell cycle inhibitors such as p21 or p16, accumulate with tissue damage and dysregulate tissue homeostasis. In the context of skeletal muscle, it is known that agents used for chemotherapy such as doxorubicin cause buildup of senescent cells, leading to the inhibition of tissue regeneration. Senescent cells influence neighboring cells via numerous secreted factors which form the senescence-associated secreted phenotype (SASP). Lipids are emerging as a key component of SASP that can control tissue homeostasis. Arachidonic acid-derived lipids have been shown to accumulate within senescent cells, specifically 15d-PGJ2, which is an electrophilic lipid produced by the non-enzymatic dehydration of the prostaglandin PGD2. In this study, we show that 15d-PGJ2 is also released by Doxorubicin-induced senescent cells as a SASP factor. Treatment of skeletal muscle myoblasts with the conditioned medium from these senescent cells inhibits myoblast fusion during differentiation. Inhibition of L-PTGDS, the enzyme that synthesizes PGD2, diminishes the release of 15d-PGJ2 by senescent cells and restores muscle differentiation. We further show that this lipid post-translationally modifies Cys184 of HRas in skeletal muscle cells, causing a reduction in the localization of HRas to the Golgi, increased HRas binding to RAF RBD, and activation of cellular MAPK-Erk signaling (but not the Akt signaling). Mutating C184 of HRas prevents the ability of 15d-PGJ2 to inhibit the differentiation of muscle cells and control the activity of HRas. This work shows that 15d-PGJ2 released from senescent cells could be targeted to restore muscle homeostasis after chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "The Shoc2 scaffold protein is crucial in transmitting signals within the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-mediated Extracellular signal-regulated Kinase (ERK1/2) pathway. While the significance of Shoc2 in this pathway is well-established, the precise mechanisms through which Shoc2 governs signal transmission remain to be fully elucidated. Hereditary mutations in Shoc2 are responsible for Noonan Syndrome with Loose anagen Hair (NSLH). However, due to the absence of known enzymatic activity in Shoc2, directly assessing how these mutations affect its function is challenging. ERK1/2 phosphorylation is used as a primary parameter of Shoc2 function, but the impact of Shoc2 mutants on the pathway activation is unclear. This study investigates how the NSLH-associated Shoc2 variants influence EGFR signals in the context of the ERK1/2 and AKT downstream signaling pathways. We show that when the ERK1/2 pathway is a primary signaling pathway activated downstream of EGFR, Shoc2 variants cannot upregulate ERK1/2 phosphorylation to the level of the WT Shoc2. Yet, when the AKT and ERK1/2 pathways were activated, in cells expressing Shoc2 variants, ERK1/2 phosphorylation was higher than in cells expressing WT Shoc2. We found that, in cells expressing the Shoc2 NSLH mutants, the AKT signaling pathway triggers the PAK activation, followed by phosphorylation and Raf-1/MEK1/2 /ERK1/2 signaling axis activation. Hence, our studies reveal a previously unrecognized feedback regulation downstream of the EGFR and provide evidence for the Shoc2 role as a \"gatekeeper\" in controlling the selection of downstream effectors within the EGFR signaling network.",

We uncovered a projection from the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus to the sSC in mice that functions as a corollary discharge hub, conveying inhibitory signals about translational optic flow and motor dynamics, including saccades, locomotion, and pupil size. Activation of this projection potently dampens visual responses and concurrently drives corresponding motor actions that resemble motor prediction errors; suppression disrupts action-specific visual perception.

    "abstract": "Microbes associated with leaf litter, the top layer of soil, collectively decompose organic matter such as plant polysaccharides, and respire carbon dioxide, regulating the land-atmosphere fluxes of carbon. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the processes limiting biopolymer degradation and their influences on soil community properties. For example, it is still unclear how substrate complexity - defined as the structure of the saccharide and the amount of external processing by extracellular enzymes - influences species interactions and species coexistence. Here, we tested the hypothesis that growth on monosaccharides (i.e., xylose) promotes negative interactions through resource competition, and growth on polysaccharides (i.e., xylan) promotes neutral or positive interactions through resource partitioning or synergism among extracellular enzymes. We assembled a three-species community of leaf litter-degrading bacteria isolated from a grassland site in Southern California. In the polysaccharide xylan, pairs of species stably coexisted and grew equally in co-culture and in monoculture. Conversely, in the monosaccharide xylose, competitive exclusion and negative interactions prevailed. These pairwise dynamics remained consistent in a three-species community: all three species coexisted in xylan, while only two species coexisted in xylose. A mathematical model parameterized from single-species growth behaviors showed that in xylose these dynamics could be explained by resource competition. Instead, the resource competition model could not predict the coexistence patterns in xylan. Overall, our study shows that substrate complexity influences species interactions and patterns of coexistence in a synthetic microbial community of leaf litter degraders that can serve as a model for studying carbon cycling and climate change.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=112 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/573222v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@abf5aeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18e99d5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1158650org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@252623_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiota of the marine herbivorous fish Kyphosus sydneyanus are thought to play an important role in host nutrition by supplying short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) through fermentation of dietary macroalgae. Here, we assembled 645 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from wild fish to determine the capacity of different bacterial taxa to degrade seaweed carbohydrates along the gut. Most bacteria (99%) were unclassified at the species level, highlighting taxonomic novelty dominated by Bacteroidia and Clostridia within the gut community. The presence of genes encoding endo-acting CAZymes in both phyla suggest they have a role in initiating glycan depolymerization. Bacteroidia also contributed the most to CAZyme-related gene expression in the distal hindgut, and encoded the highest densities of CAZymes within the community. In particular, the enrichment of CAZyme gene clusters (CGCs) within the Bacteroidia genus Alistipes (n = 73 versus just 59 distributed across all other taxa) points to an enhanced capacity for macroalgal polysaccharide utilization (e.g., alginate, laminarin and sulfated polysaccharides). Pairwise correlations of MAG relative abundances and encoded CAZyme compositions provide evidence of potential inter-species collaborations, whereby co-abundant MAGs exhibited complementary degradative capacities for specific substrates. Results indicated flexibility across these co-abundant groups in their capacity to source carbon (e.g., glucose or galactose-rich glycans), which possibly facilitates coexistence via niche partitioning. Our results indicate the potential for collaborative microbial carbohydrate metabolism in the gut of K. sydneyanus by Bacteroidia and Clostridia, and suggest that members of the genus Alistipes are a metabolically and taxonomically diverse group of specialized macroalgae biomass degraders.",

    "abstract": "KIF1A/UNC-104, a member of the kinesin super family motor proteins, plays a pivotal role in the axonal transport of synaptic vesicles and their precursors. Drosophila melanogaster UNC-104 (DmUNC-104) is a relatively recently discovered Drosophila kinesin. Although some point mutations that disrupt synapse formation have been identified, the biochemical properties of DmUNC-104 protein have not been investigated. Here, we prepared recombinant full-length DmUNC-104 protein and determined the biochemical features. We analyzed the effect of a previously identified missense mutation in the FHA domain, called bristly (bris), and found that wild-type DmUNC-104 is a mixture of monomer and dimer and the bris mutation strongly promote the dimerization. Furthermore, we found that disease-associated mutations also promote the dimerization of DmUNC-104. These findings suggest that the FHA domain is essential for the autoinhibition of KIF1A/UNC-104, and that abnormal dimerization of KIF1A is linked to human diseases.",

    "abstract": "How complex 3D tissue shape emerges during animal development remains an important open question in biology and biophysics. In this work, we study eversion of the Drosophila wing disc pouch, a 3D morphogenesis step when the epithelium transforms from a radially symmetric dome into a curved fold shape via an unknown mechanism. To explain this morphogenesis, we take inspiration from inanimate \"shape-programmable\" materials, which are capable of undergoing blueprinted 3D shape transformations arising from in-plane gradients of spontaneous strains. Here, we show that active, in-plane cellular behaviors can similarly create spontaneous strains that drive 3D tissue shape change and that the wing disc pouch is shaped in this way. We map cellular behaviors in the wing disc pouch by developing a method for quantifying spatial patterns of cell behaviors on arbitrary 3D tissue surfaces using cellular topology. We use a physical shape-programmability model to show that spontaneous strains arising from measured active cell behaviors create the tissue shape changes observed during eversion. We validate our findings using a knockdown of the mechanosensitive molecular motor MyoVI, which we find to reduce active cell rearrangements and disrupt wing pouch eversion. This work shows that shape programming is a mechanism for animal tissue morphogenesis and suggests that there exist intricate patterns in nature that could present novel designs for shape-programmable materials.",

    "abstract": "Most biological activities take place in 3D environments, where cells communicate with each other in various directions and are located in a defined, often microstructured, space. To investigate the effect of defined cyclic mechanical forces on a multicellular system, we develop a sub-millimeter sized stretching device for mechanical stimulation of a structurally restricted, soft multicellular microenvironment. For the stretching device, a multimaterial 3D microstructure made of PDMS and gelatine-based hydrogel is printed via 2-photon polymerization (2PP) method. The printed structures are first characterized microscopically and mechanically to study the effect of different printing parameters. With 2PP, organotypic cell cultures are then directly printed into the hydrogel structures to achieve true 3D cell culture systems. These are mechanically stimulated with a cantilever by indenting the stretching device at a defined point. As a most important result, the cells in the 3D organotypic cell culture change morphology and actin orientation when exposed to cyclic mechanical stretch, even within short timescales of just 30 minutes. As a proof of concept, we encapsulated a Medaka retinal organoid in the same structure to demonstrate that even preformed organoids can be stimulated by our method. The results demonstrate the power of 2PP to manufacturing multifunctional soft devices for mechanically controlling multicellular systems at micrometer resolution and thus mimicking mechanical stress situations, as they occur in vivo.",

Both plots were established in 2017 and monitored annually six times. We expected (1) higher tree diversity, distinct species composition, and greater carbon stock in MR; (2) higher carbon sequestration rates in SR; and (3) carbon dynamics shaped by growth and mortality in SR and MR, respectively. The SR plot had fewer species (67 vs. 84), stored substantially less carbon (76 vs. 193 Mg), and comprised a distinct community with fewer late-successional species than MR. SR gained 5.8 Mg carbon, due to tree growth exceeding losses from mortality, while in MR mortality exceeded growth and recruitment resulting in a 3.3 Mg carbon decline over five years. While MR had higher tree diversity, carbon stocks and relatively intact composition, the high rates of biodiversity and carbon accrual in SR highlight the conservation and climate significance of post-agroforestry secondary forests. Moderate carbon losses noted here in MR, as in other mature South Asian tropical forests, is a cause for concern under ongoing climate change.",

MINI-EX (Motif-Informed Network Inference based on single-cell EXpression data) is an integrative tool tailored for identifying cell-type-specific GRNs in plants. Leveraging single-cell transcriptomics data, MINI-EX constructs expression-based networks and integrates TF motif information to produce GRNs with increased accuracy. Furthermore, it assigns regulatory modules to distinct cell types and prioritizes candidate regulators by employing a strategy that encompasses network centrality measures, functional annotations, and expression specificity. Taken together, MINI-EX offers a powerful approach to identify cell-type-specific transcriptional cascades and enhance our understanding of TF functions in plant biology. Here, we discuss recent advancements in the tools latest version and explain how single-cell GRNs can be identified for non-model species lacking TF motif information. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive guide to use MINI-EX, covering the entire pipeline from preparing input files starting from a single-cell experiment, over configuring parameters, to interpreting output data.",

    "abstract": "Perception can be highly dependent on stimulus context, but whether and how sensory areas encode the context remains uncertain. We used an ambiguous auditory stimulus - a tritone pair - to investigate the neural activity associated with a preceding contextual stimulus that strongly influenced the tritone pairs perception: either as an ascending or a descending step in pitch.\n\nWe recorded single-unit responses from a population of auditory cortical cells in awake ferrets listening to the tritone pairs preceded by the contextual stimulus. We find that the responses adapt locally to the contextual stimulus, consistent with human MEG recordings from the auditory cortex under the same conditions. Decoding the population responses demonstrates that pitch-change selective cells are able to predict well the context-sensitive percept of the tritone pairs. Conversely, decoding the distances between the pitch representations predicts the opposite of the percept. The various percepts can be readily captured and explained by a neural model of cortical activity based on populations of adapting, pitch and pitch-direction selective cells, aligned with the neurophysiological responses.\n\nTogether, these decoding and model results suggest that contextual influences on perception may well be already encoded at the level of the primary sensory cortices, reflecting basic neural response properties commonly found in these areas.",

    "abstract": "Information in working memory is remarkably resilient to distraction. Yet, recent evidence suggests that distractors containing task-relevant features can disrupt working memory by inducing subtle biases in mnemonic representations. With multivariate decoding of human electroencephalography recordings, we show that temporally unpredictable distractors produce spatially-antagonistic mnemonic biases, across the visual hemifields. Grating distractors produced either an attractive or a repulsive mnemonic bias - a shift in the neural representation of the memorandum toward or away from the distractors orientation - depending, respectively, on whether the distractor appeared in the same hemifield as the memorandum, or opposite to it. Behavioral biases closely tracked these neural effects. We devised a two-tier ring attractor model with cross-hemifield inhibition, which comprehensively explains how the distractors timing, encoding strength, and input gating control these mnemonic biases. Our results provide a mechanistic account of distractor-induced biases, across space and time, in visual working memory.\n\nLay SummaryWorking memory - the capacity to momentarily store important items or events - is remarkably robust to distraction. Yet, when a salient distractor with features resembling the memorized items appears, it can subtly alter (bias) working memory. Applying state-of-the-art neural decoding to human electrophysiological data, we show the such distractor biases are space-specific. The neural memory representation begins to resemble the distractor (attractive bias) when the distractor appears at the same location as the memory items, but becomes less like the distractor (repulsive bias) when the distractor appears further away. We tie together these experimental findings with a simple, computational model. The findings enhance our understanding of neural mechanisms underlying working memory and may be relevant for cognitive therapies addressing memory deficits.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSocial communication deficit is a hallmark of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Mouse ultrasonic-vocalizations (USVs), with communicative significance, are extensively used to probe vocalization-based social communication impairment. However, most studies on ASDs mouse-models show inconsistent alterations in USVs based phenotypes over age and sex. Despite the predictable nature of mouse USVs, very few studies have taken advantage of the same. The current work explores USV pup-isolation-call (PIC) features and alterations in structural content of predictive PIC sequences of the well-established in-utero valproic-acid (VPA) exposure-based ASDs model. Our study shows the importance of higher-order USV structures, with speech-like sequential dependencies that have consistent alterations in ASDs model at all developmental ages and sex. In addition to confirming prior observations of reduced call rates and durations, as well as heightened peak frequencies in ASD model pups, our data underscores inconsistent trends in the call features across sex and age. The varying nature of call features in ASD models poses a substantial challenge in assessing intervention outcomes. The above inconsistency complicates the differentiation between the effects of aging and therapeutic impacts. Establishing consistent alteration in USVs could help uncover age- and sex-independent changes in ASD models, shedding light on associated therapeutics and developmental mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Integrin genes widely involve in tumorigenesis. Yet, a comprehensive characterization of integrin family and their interactome on the pan-cancer level is lacking. Here, we systematically dissect integrin family in nearly 10000 tumors across 32 cancer types. Globally, integrins represent a frequently altered and misexpressed pathway, with alteration and dysregulation overall being protumorigenic. Expression dysregulation, better than mutational landscape, of integrin family successfully identifies a subgroup of aggressive tumors demonstrating a high level of proliferation and stemness. We identify that several molecular mechanisms jointly regulate integrin expression in a context-dependent manner. For potential clinical usage, we construct a weighted score, integrinScore, to measure integrin signaling patterns in individual tumors. Remarkably, integrinScore consistently correlates with predefined molecular subtypes in multiple cancers, with integrinScore high tumors being more aggressive. Importantly, integrinScore is cancer-dependently and closely associated with proliferation, stemness, tumor microenvironment, metastasis, and immune signatures. IntegrinScore also predicts patients response to immunotherapy. By mining drug databases, we unravel an array of compounds that may serve as integrin signaling modulators. Finally, we build a user-friendly database to facilitate researchers to explore integrin-related knowledge.

Cellular adaptation to environmental cues is accompanied with this type of self-assembly and disassembly, but the mechanism allowing for the stochastic process-driven remodeling of the cell structure remains incompletely understood. Here we employ percolation theory to explore how AFs interacting only with neighboring ones without recognizing the overall configuration can nonetheless construct stress fibers (SFs) at particular locations. To achieve this, we determine the binding and unbinding probabilities of AFs undergoing cellular tensional homeostasis, a fundamental property maintaining intracellular tension. We showed that the duration required for the assembly of SFs is shortened by the amount of preexisting actin meshwork, while the disassembly occurs independently of the presence of actin meshwork. This asymmetry between the assembly and disassembly, consistently observed in actual cells, is explained by considering the nature of intracellular tension transmission. Thus, our percolation analysis provides insights into the role of coexisting higher-order actin structures in their flexible responses during cellular adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Hantaviruses are globally distributed zoonotic pathogens capable of causing fatal disease in humans. Rodents and other small mammals are the typical reservoirs of hantaviruses, though the particular host varies regionally. Addressing the risk of hantavirus spillover from animal reservoirs to humans requires identifying the local mammal reservoirs and the predictors of infection in those animals, such as their population density and habitat characteristics. We screened native and non-native small mammals and bats in northeastern Madagascar for hantavirus infection to investigate the influence of habitat, including effects of human land use on viral prevalence. We trapped 227 bats and 1663 small mammals over 5 successive years in and around Marojejy National Park across a range of habitat types including villages, agricultural fields, regrowth areas, and secondary and semi-intact forests. Animals sampled included endemic tenrecs (Tenrecidae), rodents (Nesomyidae) and bats (6 families), along with non-native rodents (Muridae) and shrews (Soricidae). A hantavirus closely related to the previously described Anjozorobe virus infected 9.5% of Rattus rattus sampled. We did not detect hantaviruses in any other species. Habitat degradation had a complex impact on hantavirus prevalence in our study system: more intensive land use increase the abundance of R. rattus. The average body size of individuals varied between agricultural and non-agricultural land-use types, which in turn affected infection prevalence. Smaller R.rattus had lower probability of infection and were captured more commonly in villages and forests. Thus, infection prevalence was highest in agricultural areas. These findings provide new insights to the gradients of hantavirus exposure risk for humans in areas undergoing rapid land use transformations associated with agricultural practices.",

    "abstract": "The tumor microenvironment is a determinant of cancer progression and therapeutic efficacy, with nutrient availability playing an important role. Although it is established that the local abundance of specific nutrients defines the metabolic parameters for tumor growth, the factors guiding nutrient availability in tumor compared to normal tissue and blood remain poorly understood. To define these factors in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), we performed quantitative metabolomic and comprehensive lipidomic analyses of tumor interstitial fluid (TIF), adjacent normal kidney interstitial fluid (KIF), and plasma samples collected from patients. TIF nutrient composition closely resembles KIF, suggesting that tissue-specific factors unrelated to the presence of cancer exert a stronger influence on nutrient levels than tumor-driven alterations. Notably, select metabolite changes consistent with known features of RCC metabolism are found in RCC TIF, while glucose levels in TIF are not depleted to levels that are lower than those found in KIF. These findings inform tissue nutrient dynamics in RCC, highlighting a dominant role of non-cancer driven tissue factors in shaping nutrient availability in these tumors.",

    "abstract": "PMP22 and MPZ are major myelin proteins in the peripheral nervous system. MPZ is a single pass integral membrane protein with an extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain and works as an adhesion protein to hold myelin wraps together across the intraperiod line. Loss of MPZ causes severe demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) peripheral neuropathy. PMP22 is an integral membrane tetraspan protein belonging to the Claudin superfamily. Homozygous loss of PMP22 also leads to severe demyelinating neuropathy, and duplication of wildtype PMP22 causes the most common form of CMT, CMT1A. Yet the molecular functions provided by PMP22 and how its alteration causes CMT are unknown. Here we find that these abundant myelin proteins form a strong and specific complex. Mutagenesis and domain swapping experiments reveal that these proteins interact through interfaces within their transmembrane domains. We also find that the PMP22 A67T patient variant that causes an HNPP (Hereditary neuropathy with pressure palsies) phenotype, reflecting a heterozygous loss-of-function, maps to this interface. The PMP22 A67T variant results in the specific loss of MPZ association with PMP22 without affecting PMP22 localization to the plasma membrane or its interactions with other proteins. These data define the molecular basis for the MPZ[~]PMP22 interaction and indicate that the MPZ[~]PMP22 complex fulfills an important function in myelinating cells.",
