    "abstract": "Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is revolutionizing the study of complex biological systems. However, most sequencing studies overlook the contribution of transposable element (TE) expression to the transcriptome. In both scRNA-seq and bulk tissue RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), quantification of TE expression is challenging due to repetitive sequence content and poorly characterized TE gene models. Here, we developed a tool and analysis pipeline for Single cell Transposable Element Locus Level Analysis of scRNA Sequencing (Stellarscope) that reassigns multi-mapped reads to specific genomic loci using an expectation-maximization algorithm. Using Stellarscope, we built an atlas of TE expression in human PBMCs. We found that locus-specific TEs delineate cell types and define new cell subsets not identified by standard mRNA expression profiles. Altogether, this study provides comprehensive insights into the influence of transposable elements in human biology.",

    "abstract": "The microenvironment is an important regulator of intertumoral trafficking and activity of immune cells. Understanding how the immune system can be tailored to maintain anti-tumor killing responses in metastatic disease remains an important goal. Thus, immune mediated eradication of metastasis requires the consideration of organ specific microenvironmental cues. Using a xenograft model of melanoma metastasis in adult zebrafish, we perturbed the dynamic balance between the infiltrating immune cells in the metastatic setting using a suite of different transgenic zebrafish. We employed intravital imaging coupled with metabolism imaging (FLIM) to visualize and map the organ specific metabolism with near simultaneity in multiple metastatic lesions. Of all the MHC complexes examined for brain and skeletal metastases, we determined that there is an organ specific expression of mhc1uba (human ortholog, MR1) for both the melanoma cells and the resident and infiltrating immune cells. Specifically, immune clusters did not express mhc1uba in brain metastatic lesions in immune competent fish. Finally, the differential immune response drove organ specific metabolism where tumor glycolysis was increased in brain metastases compared to skeletal and parental lines as measured using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). As MR1 belongs to the MHC class I molecules and is a target of immunotherapeutic drugs, we believe that our data presents an opportunity to understand the relationship between organ specific tumor metabolism and drug efficacy in the metastatic setting.",

    "abstract": "Whole-genome shotgun (WGS) metagenomic sequencing of microbial communities allows us to discover the functions, physiologies, and evolutionary histories of microbial prokaryote and eukaryote members of diverse ecosystems. Despite their importance, metagenomic studies of microbial eukaryotes lag behind those of prokaryotes, due to the difficulty in identifying and assembling high-quality eukaryotic genomes from WGS data. To address this problem, we have developed Eukfinder, a bioinformatics pipeline that recovers and assembles nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of eukaryotic microbes from WGS metagenomics data. As part of its workflow, it utilizes two specialized databases to classify reads based on taxonomy which can be customized to the dataset or environment of interest. We applied Eukfinder to human gut microbiome WGS metagenomic sequencing data to recover genomes from the protistan parasite Blastocystis sp., a highly prevalent colonizer of the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals. We tested Eukfinder using both a series of simulated gut microbiome datasets, which included varying numbers of Blastocystis reads combined with bacterial reads and by using real metagenomic gut samples containing Blastocystis. We compared the results of Eukfinder with other published workflows. With sufficient reads, Eukfinder efficiently assembles high-quality near-complete nuclear and mitochondrial genomes from diverse Blastocystis subtypes from metagenomic data without the aid of a reference genome. Furthermore, with sufficient depth of sequence sampling, Eukfinder outperforms similar tools used to recover eukaryotic genomes from metagenomic data. Eukfinder will be a useful tool for reference-independent and cultivation-free study of eukaryotic microbial genomes from environmental metagenomic sequencing samples.\n\nIMPORTANCERapid advancements in next-generation sequencing technologies have made whole-genome shotgun (WGS) metagenomic sequencing an efficient method for de novo reconstruction of microbial genomes from samples taken from different environments. So far, thousands of new prokaryotic genomes have been characterized from strains or species that were unknown to science. However, the relatively large size and complexity of protistan genomes has, until recently, precluded the use of the WGS metagenomic approach to sample microbial eukaryotic diversity. The bioinformatics pipeline we developed, Eukfinder, can recover eukaryotic microbial genomes from environmental WGS metagenomic samples. By retrieving high-quality protistan genomes from diverse metagenomic samples, we can increase numbers of reference genomes available to aid future metagenomic investigations into the functions, physiologies, and evolutionary histories of eukaryotic microbes in the gut microbiome and a variety of other ecosystems.",
