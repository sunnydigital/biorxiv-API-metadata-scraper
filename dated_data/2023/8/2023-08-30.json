    "abstract": "What is the genetic architecture of local adaptation and what is the geographic scale over which it operates? We investigated patterns of local and convergent adaptation in five sympatric population pairs of traditionally cultivated maize and its wild relative teosinte (Zea mays subsp. parviglumis). We found that signatures of local adaptation based on the inference of adaptive fixations and selective sweeps are frequently exclusive to individual populations, more so in teosinte compared to maize. However, for both maize and teosinte, selective sweeps are also frequently shared by several populations, and often between subspecies. We were further able to infer that selective sweeps were shared among populations most often via migration, though sharing via standing variation was also common. Our analyses suggest that teosinte has been a continued source of beneficial alleles for maize, even after domestication, and that maize populations have facilitated adaptation in teosinte by moving beneficial alleles across the landscape. Taken together, our results suggest local adaptation in maize and teosinte has an intermediate geographic scale, one that is larger than individual populations, but smaller than the species range.",

    "abstract": "Previous research favours the idea that modern humans spread worldwide from Africa. For instance, through autosomal diversity, an area of origin for this worldwide expansion is indicated to entirely be within Africa. It remained to be seen if this indication happens for certain variables such as Y-chromosomal diversity. There is disagreement regarding where in Africa the origin is. Support for a region could reflect non-African ancestry rather than the expansion. The present research considered whether some genetic and cranial variables indicate the expansion, and, furthermore, where in Africa the expansion started. Variables included, for example, autosomal diversity (in sub-Saharan Africa) which was adjusted for non-African ancestry, Y-chromosomal diversity, and cranial sexual size dimorphism. For each, it was seen if the estimated area of origin was solely in Africa. Moreover, to generally estimate the origin, a centroid was calculated from potential origins which were obtained in the present, and past, research. The area of origin was completely within Africa for each variable except one - for Y-chromosomal diversity, the area was possibly in Asia only. The centroid of the potential origins was in southern Africa. The autosomal diversity of sub-Saharan African populations, adjusted for non-African ancestry, indicated a southern African origin. This adjusted diversity appeared to start declining from about 2,000-3,000 km away from the origin; the non-linearity may be explained by travels after the expansion, or the expansion entering locations in Africa which were already populated, to differing extents, by modern humans. Southern Africa is perhaps where the expansion began.",

    "abstract": "A large body of work has identified characteristic neural signatures of value-based decision-making. A core circuit has been shown to track the values of options under consideration, and the dynamics of neural activity associated with this circuit have been found to closely resemble the ramping evidence accumulation process believed to underpin goal-directed choice, most notably in the centroparietal positivity (CPP). However, recent neuroimaging studies suggest that value-based choices trigger multiple value-related neural signatures, some of which are unrelated to decision-making per se but instead reflect reflexive affective reactions to ones options. Here, we use the temporal resolution of EEG to test whether choice-independent value signals could be dissociated from well-known temporal signatures of the choice process. We show that EEG activity during value-based choice can be decomposed into distinct spatiotemporal clusters, one stimulus-locked (associated with the affective salience of a choice set) and one response-locked (associated with the difficulty of selecting the best option). We show that neither of these clusters meet the criteria for an evidence accumulation signal. Instead, and to our surprise, we find across two studies that stimulus-locked activity can mimic an evidence accumulation process when aligned to the response (as with the CPP). We then re-analyze four previous studies that demonstrate an evidence accumulation signal in the CPP - one during value-based decision-making, the others during perceptual decision-making - and show that this signal disappears when stimulus-locked and response-locked signals are jointly accounted for. Collectively, our findings show that neural signatures of value can reflect choice-independent processes that when analyzed using standard approaches, can look deceptively like evidence accumulation.\n\nSignificance StatementTo choose, people must evaluate their options and select between them. Selection is well described by a process of accumulating evidence up to some threshold, with an electrophysiological signature in the centroparietal positivity (CPP). However, decision-making also gives rise to value signals reflecting affective reactions and other selection-unrelated processes. Measuring EEG while participants made value-based choices, we identified two spatiotemporally distinct value signals, neither reflecting evidence accumulation. Instead, we show that evidence accumulation signals found in the CPP can arise artifactually from overlapping stimulus- and response-related activity. These findings call for a significant reexamination of established links between neural and computational mechanisms of choice, while inviting deeper consideration of the array of cognitive and affective processes that occur in parallel.",

    "abstract": "Synchronization between auditory stimuli and brain rhythms is beneficial for perception. In principle, auditory perception could be improved by facilitating neural entrainment to sounds via brain stimulation. However, high inter-individual variability of brain stimulation effects questions the usefulness of this approach. Here we aimed to modulate auditory perception by modulating neural entrainment to frequency modulated (FM) sounds using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). In addition, we evaluated the advantage of using tACS montages spatially optimized for each individuals anatomy and functional data compared to a standard montage applied to all participants. Across two different sessions, 2-Hz tACS was applied targeting auditory brain regions. Concurrent with tACS, participants listened to FM stimuli with modulation rate matching the tACS frequency but with different phase lags relative to the tACS, and detected silent gaps embedded in the FM sound. We observed that tACS modulated the strength of behavioral entrainment to the FM sound in a phase-lag specific manner. Both the optimal tACS lag and the magnitude of the tACS effect were variable across participants and sessions. Inter-individual variability of tACS effects was best explained by the strength of the inward electric field, depending on the field focality and proximity to the target brain region. Although additional evidence is necessary, our results also provided suggestive insights that spatially optimizing the electrode montage could be a promising tool to reduce inter-individual variability of tACS effects. This work demonstrates that tACS effectively modulates entrainment to sounds depending on the optimality of the electric field. However, the lack of reliability on optimal tACS lags calls for caution when planning tACS experiments based on separate sessions.",

They impact microbial community composition and reprogram the metabolism of diverse host cells using auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs). Whether bacteriophages can reprogram host polysaccharide metabolism through AMGs remains unclear, however. Here, we found for the first time that polysaccharides induce the production of different types of bacteriophages in two deep-sea Lentisphaerae strains (WC36 and zth2). Through physiological assays, genomic analysis and transcriptomics assays, we found that these bacteriophages might assist their hosts in metabolizing polysaccharides through AMGs. Moreover, the isolated bacteriophages could effectively assist a marine bacterium (Pseudomonas stutzeri 273) in metabolizing and utilizing polysaccharide to promote its growth. These findings shed light on the importance of atypical and poorly understood virus-host interactions and bring us closer to understanding the potential role of deep-sea viruses in marine ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have been increasingly recognized for their potential value in pre-clinical research, but their applications have not been extensively explored in behavioral neuroscience. In this work, we studied protein synthesis inhibition, a classic intervention used to disrupt fear learning, reconsolidation, and extinction in rodents, to explore how meta-analyses can identify potential moderators of its effect. We initially performed separate meta-analyses for different injection sites and target sessions to evaluate the effect of the intervention in various scenarios. Heterogeneity was further investigated by multilevel meta-regression models aggregating various sites, with article or research group as additional levels. We detected robust effects of protein synthesis inhibitors on training and reconsolidation, but not on extinction, possibly due to the lower number of studies on the latter. Our analyses identified some well-established moderators, such as intervention timing and reexposure duration. However, other factors proposed as boundary conditions for reconsolidation, such as memory age and training strength, were not associated with effect size. While our results point to the value of meta-analyses in consolidating findings from the literature, we believe that associations suggested by data synthesis should ideally be verified by well-powered, rigorous confirmatory experiments.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell expression dynamics from differentiation trajectories or RNA velocity have the potential to reveal causal links between transcription factors (TFs) and their target genes in gene regulatory networks (GRNs). However, existing methods either neglect these expression dynamics or require cells to be ordered along a linear pseudotemporal axis, which is incompatible with branching trajectories. We introduce Velorama, an approach to causal GRN inference that represents single-cell differentiation dynamics as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of cells constructed from pseudotime or RNA velocity measurements. In contrast to previous approaches, Velorama is able to work directly with RNA velocity-based cell-to-cell transition probabilities and enables estimates of TF interaction speeds with their target genes. On a set of synthetic datasets, Velorama substantially outperforms existing approaches, improving area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) by 3.7-4.8x over the next best method. Applying Velorama to four RNA velocity datasets, we uncover evidence that the speed of a TFs interactions is tied to its regulatory function. For human corticogenesis, we find slow TFs to be linked to gliomas and co-regulate preferentially with fast TFs, while fast TFs are associated with neuropsychiatric diseases. We expect Velorama to be a critical part of the RNA velocity toolkit for investigating the causal drivers of differentiation and disease.\n\nSoftware availabilityhttps://cb.csail.mit.edu/cb/velorama",

We investigated home range behavior and spatial interactions in four common parrotfishes on coral reefs in Bonaire, Caribbean Netherlands, to determine how spatial interactions mediate species interactions and contribute to their coexistence. We first computed home ranges for males and females of each species. We then quantified spatial overlap (i.e., static interaction) between the home ranges of neighboring male parrotfishes and their activity in shared areas to estimate interaction potential for pairs of individuals. Finally, we analyzed dynamic interactions in simultaneously tracked, spatially co-occurring interspecific pairs of parrotfishes to investigate how they interact in shared space. Generally, spatial overlap of home ranges was much lower for intraspecific pairs than for interspecific pairs, but the probability of finding males in areas shared with males of other species was species-dependent. Males in interspecific pairs moved mostly independently of each other in shared areas, but we did find some evidence of avoidance in interspecific pairs sharing the most space. We discuss our findings within the context of parrotfish social and foraging ecology to further elucidate the spatial ecology of these functionally important reef fishes.",

    "abstract": "Failure of cancer immunotherapy is linked to T cell exhaustion. To decipher the underlying mechanisms, we explored the T cell landscape in blood, bone marrow and lymph node samples of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and spleen samples of a CLL mouse model. By single-cell RNA-sequencing, mass cytometry (CyTOF), and multiplex image analysis of tissue microarrays, we identified a disease-specific accumulation of distinct regulatory T cell subsets and T cell exhaustion stages and their trajectories in CLL lymph nodes. Integration of T cell receptor sequencing data revealed a clonal expansion of CD8+ precursor exhausted T cells (TPEX), suggesting their CLL reactivity. Interactome analyses identified the TIM3 ligand Galectin-9 as a novel immunoregulatory molecule in CLL. Blocking of Galectin-9 in CLL-bearing mice slowed down disease development and reduced the number of TIM3-expressing T cells. Galectin-9 expression correlated with shorter survival of patients with CLL, renal cell carcinoma or glioma.\n\nStatement of significanceOur findings for the first time define the T cell landscape in CLL lymph nodes and reshape the current understanding of T cell exhaustion in this malignancy.

    "abstract": "Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) has a poor prognosis, and no new drugs have been identified in decades. The absence of drug development can partly be attributed to a lack of preclinical models. Both animal models and 2D cell cultures of ACC fail to accurately mimic the disease, as animal physiology is inherently different than humans, and 2D cultures fail to represent the crucial 3D architecture. Organoids and other small 3D in vitro models of tissues or tumors can model certain complexities of human in vivo biology; however, this technology has largely yet to be applied to ACC. In this study, we describe the generation of 3D tumor constructs from an established ACC cell line, NCI-H295R. NCI-H295R cells were encapsulated to generate 3D ACC constructs. Tumor constructs were assessed for biomarker expression, viability, proliferation, and cortisol production. In addition, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) functionality was assessed directly using fluorogenic MMP-sensitive biosensors and through infusion of NCI-H295R cells into a metastasis-on-a-chip microfluidic device platform. ACC tumor constructs showed expression of biomarkers associated with ACC, including SF-1, Melan A, and inhibin . Treatment of ACC tumor constructs with chemotherapeutics demonstrated decreased drug sensitivity compared to 2D cell culture. Since most tumor cells migrate through tissue using MMPs to break down extracellular matrix, we validated the utility of ACC tumor constructs by integrating fluorogenic MMP-sensitive peptide biosensors within the tumor constructs. Lastly, in our metastasis-on-a-chip device, NCI-H295R cells successfully engrafted in a downstream lung cell line-based construct, but invasion distance into the lung construct was decreased by MMP inhibition. These studies, which would not be possible using 2D cell cultures, demonstrated that NCI-H295R cells secreted active MMPs that are used for invasion in 3D. This work represents the first evidence of a 3D tumor constructs platform for ACC that can be deployed for future mechanistic studies as well as development of new targets for intervention and therapies.\n\nSignificanceThe paucity of preclinical research models has contributed to lack of progress in treatment of adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC). Three-dimensional modeling of ACC may provide novel insights for preclinical studies and advance ACC research.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian telencephalon contains a tremendous diversity of GABAergic projection neuron and interneuron types, that originate in a germinal zone of the embryonic basal ganglia. How genetic information in this transient structure is transformed into different cell types is not yet fully understood. Using a combination of in vivo CRISPR perturbation, lineage tracing, and ChIP-seq in mice, we found that the transcription factor MEIS2 favors the development of projection neurons through genomic binding sites in regulatory enhancers of projection neuron specific genes. MEIS2 requires the presence of the homeodomain transcription factor DLX5 to direct its functional activity towards these sites. In interneuron precursors, the activation of projection neuron specific enhancers by MEIS2 and DLX5 is repressed by the transcription factor LHX6. When MEIS2 carries a mutation associated with intellectual disability in humans, it is less effective at activating enhancers involved in projection neuron development. This suggests that GABAergic differentiation may be impaired in patients carrying this mutation. Our research supports a model (\"Differential Binding ) where the spatial specific composition of transcription factors at cis-regulatory elements determines differential gene expression and cell fate decisions in the ganglionic eminence.",

    "abstract": "Local adaptation commonly involves alleles of large effect, which experience fitness advantages when in positive linkage disequilibrium (LD). Because segregating inversions suppress recombination and facilitate the maintenance of LD between locally adapted loci, they are also commonly found to be associated with adaptive divergence. However, it is unclear what fraction of an adaptive response can be attributed to inversions and alleles of large effect, and whether the loci within an inversion could still drive adaptation in the absence of its recombination-suppressing effect. Here, we use genome-wide association studies to explore patterns of local adaptation in three species of sunflower: Helianthus annuus, H. argophyllus, and H. petiolaris, which each harbour a large number of species-specific inversions. We find evidence of significant genome-wide repeatability in signatures of association to phenotypes and environments, which are particularly enriched within regions of the genome harbouring an inversion in one species. This shows that while inversions may facilitate local adaptation, at least some of the loci can still harbour mutations that make substantial contributions without the benefit of recombination suppression in species lacking a segregating inversion. While a large number of genomic regions show evidence of repeated adaptation, most of the strongest signatures of association still tend to be species-specific, indicating substantial genotypic redundancy for local adaptation in these species.",

    "abstract": "In the mammalian host, the biology of tissue-dwelling Trypanosoma brucei parasites is not completely understood, especially the mechanisms involved in their extravascular colonization. The trypanosome flagellum is an essential organelle in multiple aspects of the parasites development. The flagellar protein termed FLAgellar Member 8 (FLAM8) acts as a docking platform for a pool of Cyclic AMP response protein 3 (CARP3) that is involved in signaling. FLAM8 exhibits a stage-specific distribution suggesting specific functions in the mammalian and vector stages of the parasite. Analyses of knockdown and knockout trypanosomes in their mammalian forms demonstrated that FLAM8 is not essential in vitro for survival, growth, motility and stumpy differentiation. Functional investigations in experimental infections showed that FLAM8-deprived trypanosomes can establish and maintain an infection in the blood circulation and differentiate into insect transmissible forms. However, quantitative bioluminescence imaging and gene expression analysis revealed that FLAM8-null parasites exhibit a significantly impaired dissemination in the extravascular compartment, that is restored by the addition of a single rescue copy of FLAM8. In vitro trans-endothelial migration assays revealed significant defects in trypanosomes lacking FLAM8. FLAM8 is the first flagellar component shown to modulate T. brucei distribution in the host tissues, possibly through sensing functions, contributing to the maintenance of extravascular parasite populations in mammalian anatomical niches, especially in the skin.\n\nAuthor SummaryTrypanosoma brucei parasites cause neglected tropical diseases termed human and animal African trypanosomiases. Transmitted by the bite of an infected tsetse fly, upon deposition in the skin of a mammalian host, these parasites occupy both the vasculature and extravascular tissues. Currently, the biology of tissue-resident parasites is not well understood, and the parasite factors that mediate extravascular colonization are not known. Using quantitative in vivo bioluminescence imaging and ex vivo gene expression quantification in host infected tissues and blood, we reveal that the flagellar parasite protein FLAM8 modulates the extravascular dissemination of trypanosomes in the mammalian host. FLAM8 is known to act as a docking platform for signaling complexes in the flagellum, but we observe that it does not influence parasite differentiation into transmissible stages. However, we show that the absence of FLAM8 results in the loss of a key component of the flagellar adenylate cyclase signaling complexes, and reduces parasite migration through endothelial cell monolayers, suggesting that FLAM8 is important for parasite exchanges between the intravascular and the extravascular compartments. This work identifies a key trypanosome flagellar component involved in host-parasite interactions, including the modulation of parasite tropism and extravascular dissemination.",

    "abstract": "Evoked responses and ongoing oscillations represent two major electrophysiological phenomena in the human brain yet the link between them remains rather obscure. Here we show how these two types of brain activity can be mechanistically linked within the framework of the baseline-shift mechanism for the generation of evoked responses. We do so for the two most frequently studied EEG signals: the P300-evoked response and alpha oscillations (8-12 Hz). The baseline-shift mechanism states that oscillations may generate evoked responses if oscillations have a non-zero mean and their amplitude is modulated by the stimulus. Therefore, if the alpha amplitude modulation generates P300, the following predictions should hold: 1) the temporal evolution of P300 and alpha amplitude is similar, 2) spatial localisations of the P300 and alpha amplitude modulation overlap, 3) oscillations are non-zero mean with a sign of the mean being congruent to P300 polarity and direction of alpha amplitude change, 4) P300 and alpha amplitude modulation correlate with cognitive scores in a similar fashion. To fully and reliably validate these predictions, we analysed the data set of elderly participants (N=2230, 60-82 years old), using a) resting-state EEG recordings to compute the baseline-shift index (BSI) to quantify the mean of oscillations, b) the event-related data, to extract parameters of P300 and c) alpha rhythm amplitude envelope. The data was analysed both in sensor and source space. We showed that P300 is indeed linked to alpha amplitude modulation according to all four abovementioned predictions: 1) the time courses of P300 and alpha amplitude envelope correlate negatively; 2) both P300 and alpha rhythm spatially localised in the posterior region of the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex; 3) the sign of the BSI at Pz electrode is predominantly negative, consistent with the positive polarity of P300 and decrease of alpha amplitude; moreover, a negative BSIs of higher magnitude corresponded to higher P300 amplitude; 4) attention, memory, and executive function scores have congruent correlations for P300 and alpha rhythm amplitude. Our results provide an unifying view on the interdependency of evoked responses and neuronal oscillations and suggest that P300, at least partly, is generated by the modulation of alpha oscillations. Therefore, changes in P300 related to different cognitive conditions, age, or neuropathologies should be interpreted by taking into account the spatio-temporal dynamics of neuronal oscillations.",

Herein, we aimed to enhance their efficacy by using a pyro-drive liquid jet injector that precisely controls pressure to widely disperse mRNA solution in the skin. The jet injection boosted naked mRNA delivery efficiency in the mouse skin. Mechanistic analyses indicate that dendritic cells, upon uptake of antigen mRNA in the skin, migrate to the draining lymph nodes for antigen presentation. Additionally, the jet injector activated innate immune responses in the skin, presumably by inducing physical stress, thus serving as a physical adjuvant. From a safety perspective, our approach, utilizing naked mRNA, restricted mRNA distribution solely to the injection site, preventing systemic pro-inflammatory reactions following vaccination. Ultimately, the jet injection of naked mRNA encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike protein elicited robust humoral and cellular immunity, providing protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice. Furthermore, our approach induced plasma activity of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 in non-human primates, comparable to that observed in mice, with no detectable systemic reactogenicity.",

    "abstract": "SummaryPangenomes are replacing single reference genomes as the definitive representation of DNA sequence within a species or clade. Pangenome analysis predominantly leverages graph-based methods that require computationally intensive multiple genome alignments, do not scale to highly complex eukaryotic genomes, limit their scope to identifying structural variants (SVs), or incur bias by relying on a reference genome. Here, we present PanKmer, a toolkit designed for reference-free analysis of pangenome datasets consisting of dozens to thou-sands of individual genomes. PanKmer decomposes a set of input genomes into a table of observed k-mers and their presence-absence values in each genome. These are stored in an efficient k-mer index data format that encodes SNPs, INDELs, and SVs. It also includes functions for downstream analysis of the k-mer index, such as calculating sequence similarity statistics between individuals at whole-genome or local scales. For example, k-mers can be \"anchored\" in any individual genome to quantify sequence variability or conservation at a specific locus. This facilitates workflows with various biological applications, e.g. identifying cases of hybridization between plant species. PanKmer provides researchers with a valuable and convenient means to explore the full scope of genetic variation in a population, without reference bias.\n\nAvailability and implementationPanKmer is implemented as a Python package with components written in Rust, released under a BSD license.

    "abstract": "Social behaviours can allow individuals to flexibly respond to environmental change, potentially buffering adverse effects. However, individuals may respond differently to the same environmental stimulus, complicating predictions for population-level response to environmental change. Here we show that bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) alter their social behaviour at yearly and monthly scales in response to a proxy for food availability (salmon abundance) but do not respond to variation in a proxy for climate (the North Atlantic Oscillation index). There was also individual variation in plasticity for gregariousness and connectedness to distant parts of the social network, although these traits showed limited repeatability. In contrast, individuals showed consistent differences in clustering with their immediate social environment at the yearly scale but no individual variation in plasticity for this trait at either time scale. These results indicate that social behaviour in free-ranging cetaceans can be highly resource dependent with individuals increasing their connectedness over short timescales but possibly reducing their wider range of connection at longer timescales. Some social traits showed more individual variation in plasticity or mean behaviour than others, highlighting how predictions for the responses of populations to environmental variation must consider the type of individual variation present in the population.",

    "abstract": "Viral inclusion bodies (IBs) commonly form during the replication of Ebola virus (EBOV) in infected cells, but their role in viral immune evasion has rarely been explored. Here, we found that interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), but not TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK-1) or I{kappa}B kinase epsilon (IKK{varepsilon}), was recruited and sequestered in viral IBs when the cells were infected by EBOV transcription- and replication-competent virus-like particles (trVLPs). NP/VP35-induced IBs formation was critical for IRF3 recruitment and sequestration, probably through interaction with STING. Consequently, the association of TBK1 and IRF3, which plays a vital role in type I interferon (IFN-I) induction, was blocked by EBOV trVLPs infection. Additionally, IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation induced by Sendai virus (SeV) or poly(I:C) stimulation were suppressed by EBOV trVLPs. Furthermore, downregulation of STING significantly attenuated VP35-induced IRF3 accumulation in IBs. Coexpression of the viral proteins by which IBs-like structures formed was much more potent in antagonizing IFN-I than expression of the IFN-I antagonist VP35 alone. These results suggested a novel immune evasion mechanism by which EBOV evades host innate immunity.\n\nImpact statementEbola virus VP35 protein evades host antiviral immunity by interacting with STING to sequester IRF3 into inclusion bodies and inhibit type-I interferon production.",

    "abstract": "A considerable number of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) and other carbohydrate-active enzymes are modular, with catalytic domains being tethered to additional domains, such as carbohydrate-binding modules, by flexible linkers. While such linkers may affect the structure, function, and stability of the enzyme, their roles remain largely enigmatic, as do the reasons for natural variation in length and sequence. Here, we have explored linker functionality using the two-domain cellulose-active ScLPMO10C from Streptomyces coelicolor as a model system. In addition to investigating the wild-type enzyme, we engineered three linker variants to address the impact of both length and sequence and characterized these using SAXS, NMR, MD simulations, and functional assays. The resulting data revealed that, in the case of ScLPMO10C, linker length is the main determinant of linker conformation and enzyme performance. Both the wild-type and a serine-rich variant, which have the same linker length, demonstrated better performance compared to those with either a shorter or longer linker. A highlight of our findings was the substantial thermostability observed in the serine-rich variant. Importantly, the linker affects thermal unfolding behavior and enzyme stability. In particular, unfolding studies show that the two domains unfold independently when mixed, while the full-length enzyme shows one cooperative unfolding transition, meaning that the impact of linkers in biomass processing enzymes is more complex than mere structural tethering.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic islet-reactive B lymphocytes promote Type 1 diabetes (T1D) by presenting antigen to islet-destructive T cells. Teplizumab, an anti-CD3 monoclonal, delays T1D onset in patients at risk, but additional therapies are needed to prevent disease entirely. Therefore, bifunctional molecules were designed to selectively inhibit T1D-promoting anti-insulin B cells by conjugating a ligand for the B cell inhibitory receptor CD22 (i.e., CD22L) to insulin, which permit these molecules to concomitantly bind to anti-insulin B cell receptors (BCRs) and CD22. Two prototypes were synthesized: 2:2 insulin-CD22L conjugate on a 4-arm PEG backbone, and 1:1 insulin-CD22L direct conjugate. Transgenic mice (125TgSD) expressing anti-insulin BCRs provided cells for in vitro testing. Cells were cultured with constructs for three days then assessed by flow cytometry. Duplicate wells with anti-CD40 simulated T cell help. Surprisingly, a 2-insulin 4-arm PEG control caused robust proliferation and activation-induced CD86 upregulation. Anti-CD40 further boosted these effects. This was unexpected, as soluble insulin alone has no effect, and may indicate that BCR-crosslinking occurs when antigens are tethered by the PEG backbone. Addition of CD22L via the 2:2 insulin-CD22L conjugate restored B cell properties to that of controls without additional beneficial effect. In contrast, the 1:1 insulin-CD22L direct conjugate significantly reduced anti-insulin B cell proliferation in the presence of anti-CD40. CD22L alone had no effect, and the constructs did not affect WT B cells. Thus, high valency constructs activate anti-insulin B cells, while low-valency antigen-CD22L conjugates co-ligate BCR and CD22, reducing B cell activation in response to simulated T cell help and reducing pathogenic B cell numbers without harming normal cells. Thus, the insulin-CD22L direct conjugate is a promising candidate for preclinical trials to prevent T1D without inducing immunodeficiency",

    "abstract": "Plastics are pervasive in marine ecosystems and ubiquitous in both shallow and deep oceans. Microfibers, amongst other microscopic plastics, accumulate in deep sea sediments at concentrations up to four orders of magnitude higher than in surface waters. This is at odds with the fact that most microfibers are positively buoyant; therefore, it is hypothesized that settling aggregates are vectors for downward transport of microfibers in the ocean. However, little is known about the impact of microfibers on carbon export. We formed diatom aggregates with differing concentrations of microfibers using roller tanks and observed that microfiber addition stimulated aggregate formation, but decreased their structural cohesion and caused them to break apart more readily, resulting in smaller average sizes. Incorporation of positively buoyant microfibers into settling aggregates reduced their size-specific sinking velocities proportional to the microfiber concentration. Slower sinking may extend aggregate retention time in the upper ocean, thereby increasing the time available for organic matter remineralization in the upper water column. Here, we show that microfiber concentrations typical of those in the English Channel and Atlantic Ocean decrease potential export flux by 15-50%. Present day microfiber concentrations in surface waters may therefore be substantially reducing the efficiency of the biological carbon pump relative to the pre-plastic era.",

    "abstract": "Temperature is one of the key determinants of microbial behavior and survival, whose impact is typically studied under heat- or cold-shock conditions that elicit specific regulation to combat lethal stress. At intermediate temperatures, cellular growth rate varies according to the Arrhenius law of thermodynamics without stress responses, a behavior whose origins have not yet been elucidated. Using single-cell microscopy during temperature perturbations, we show that bacteria exhibit a highly conserved, gradual response to temperature upshifts with a time scale of [~]1.5 doublings at the higher temperature, regardless of initial/final temperature or nutrient source. We find that this behavior is coupled to a temperature memory, which we rule out as being neither transcriptional, translational, nor membrane dependent. Instead, we demonstrate that an autocatalytic enzyme network incorporating temperature-sensitive Michaelis-Menten kinetics recapitulates all temperature-shift dynamics through metabolome rearrangement, which encodes a temperature memory and successfully predicts alterations in the upshift response observed under simple-sugar, low-nutrient conditions, and in fungi. This model also provides a mechanistic framework for both Arrhenius-dependent growth and the classical Monod Equation through temperature-dependent metabolite flux.",

    "abstract": "Metagenomic profiling algorithms commonly rely on genomic differences between lineages, strains, or species to infer the relative abundances of sequences present in a sample. This observation plays an important role in the analysis of diverse microbial communities, where targeted sequencing of 16S and 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), both well-known hypervariable genomic regions, have led to insights into microbial diversity and the discovery of novel organisms. However, the variable nature of discriminatory regions can also act as a double-edged sword, as the sought-after variability can make it difficult to design primers for their amplification through Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Moreover, the most variable regions are not necessarily the most informative regions for the purpose of differentiation; one should focus on regions that maximize the number of lineages that can be distinguished. Here we present AmpliDiff, a computational tool that simultaneously finds such highly discriminatory genomic regions, as well as primers allowing for the amplification of these regions. We show that regions and primers found by AmpliDiff can be used to accurately estimate relative abundances of SARS-CoV-2 lineages, for example in wastewater sequencing data. We obtain mean absolute prediction errors that are comparable with using whole genome information to estimate relative abundances. Furthermore, our results show that AmpliDiff is robust against incomplete input data and that primers designed by AmpliDiff continue to bind to genomes originating from months after the primers were selected. With AmpliDiff we provide an effective and efficient alternative to whole genome sequencing for estimating lineage abundances in viral metagenomes.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered regions of proteins are responsible for many biological processes such as in the case of liver kinase LKB1 - a serine/threonine kinase, relevant for cell proliferation and cell polarity. LKB1 itself becomes fully activated upon recruitment to the plasma membrane by binding of its disordered C-terminal polybasic motif consisting of eight lysines/arginines to phospholipids. Here we present extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the polybasic motif interacting with a model membrane composed of phosphatidylcholin (POPC) and phosphatidic acid (PA) and cell culture experiments. Protein-membrane binding effects are due to the electrostatic interactions between the polybasic amino acids and PAs. For significant binding the first three lysines turn out to be dispensable, which was also recapitulated in cell culture using transfected GFP-LKB1 variants. LKB1-membrane binding results in a non-monotonous changes in the structure of the protein as well as of the membrane, in particular accumulation of PAs and reduced thickness at the protein-membrane contact area. The protein-lipid binding turns out to be highly dynamic due to an interplay of PA-PA repulsion and protein-PA attraction. The thermodynamics of this interplay is captured by a statistical fluctuation model, which allows the estimation of both energies. Quantification of the significance of each polar amino acid in the polybasic provides detailed insights into the molecular mechanism of the protein-membrane binding of LKB1. These results can be likely transferred to other proteins, which interact by intrinsically disordered polybasic regions with anionic membranes.",

To investigate the mechanisms of toxicity triggered by NS, we here used (PR)n arginine-rich peptides that are found in patients of some neurodegenerative diseases. Although these peptides accumulate at nucleoli and generate NS, how this translates into cellular toxicity is poorly understood. We here reveal that whereas (PR)n expression leads to an overall decrease in protein abundance, this occurs concomitant with an accumulation of free ribosomal (r) proteins in the cytoplasm, a hallmark of ribosomopathies. Conversely, cells with acquired resistance to (PR)n peptides present global downregulation of r-proteins and low levels of mTOR signaling. In mice, systemic expression of (PR)97 drives widespread NS and accelerated ageing, which is associated to an increased expression of r-proteins and mTOR hyperactivation. Furthermore, the reduced lifespan of (PR)97-expressing mice was alleviated by the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Importantly, we show that the generalised accumulation of free r-proteins is a common outcome in response to chemical or genetic perturbations that trigger NS, such as Actinomycin D, TIF-IA depletion, or the expression of mutant HMGB1 variants recently associated to rare human diseases. Together, our study presents in vivo evidence supporting the role of NS as a driver of ageing, and provides a general framework to explain the toxicity caused by NS in mammalian cells.",

    "abstract": "Having tools and resources for independent control of gene expression in two different tissues in the same animal is emerging as a major need, especially in the context of inter-organ communication studies. This type of study is made possible by technologies combining the GAL4/UAS and a second binary expression system such as LexA/LexAop or QF/QUAS. Here, we describe a resource of reagents that facilitate combined use of the GAL4/UAS and a second binary systems in various tissues. Focusing on genes with well-characterized GAL4 expression patterns, we generated a set of more than 40 LexA-GAD and QF2 insertions by CRISPR knock-in and verified their tissue-specificity in larvae. We also built constructs that encode QF2 and LexA-GAD transcription factors in a single vector, with each coding sequence flanked by FRT sites. Following successful integration into the fly genome, the vector generates a single polypeptide, which is separated into the individual drivers by the inclusion of T2A. If desired, one of the two coding regions can then be excised with Flp, resulting in flies that express only QF2 or LexA-GAD. We evaluated both QF2 and LexA-GAD systems for in vivo gene knockdown and are generating a compatible library of transgenic shRNA lines in our custom QUAS and LexAop vectors as a community resource. Together, these QF2/LexA-GAD and QUAS/LexAop vectors and fly lines will provide a new set of tools for researchers who need to activate or repress two different genes in an orthogonal manner in the same animal.",

    "abstract": "1Human gamma-D crystallin (HGD) is the major constituent of the eye lens. Aggregation of HGD contributes to cataract formation, the leading cause of blindness worldwide. It is unique in its longevity, maintaining its folded and soluble state for 50-60 years. One outstanding question is the structural basis of this longevity despite oxidative aging and environmental stressors including ultraviolet radiation (UV). Here we present crystallographic structures evidencing a UV-induced crystallin redox switch mechanism. The room-temperature serial synchrotron crystallographic (SSX) structure of freshly prepared crystallin shows no post-translational modifications. After aging for nine months in the absence of light, a covalently bound reducing agent modifying surface cysteines is observed for the first time by low-dose SSX. This is shown to be UV-labile in an acutely light-exposed structure. This suggests a mechanism by which a major source of crystallin damage, UV, may also act as a rescuing factor in a finely balanced redox system.",

    "abstract": "Filopodia are thin synaptic protrusions that have been long known to play an important role in early development. It has recently been found that they are more abundant in the adult cortex than previously thought, and more plastic than spines (button-shaped mature synapses). Inspired by these findings, we introduce a new model of synaptic plasticity that jointly describes learning of filopodia and spines. The model assumes that filopodia exhibit additive learning, which is highly competitive and volatile. At the same time, it proposes that if filopodia undergo sufficient potentiation they consolidate into spines, and start following multiplicative learning dynamics. This makes spines more stable and sensitive to the fine structure of input correlations. We show that our learning rule has a selectivity comparable to additive spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) and represents input correlations as well as multiplicative STDP. We also show how it can protect previously formed memories and act as a synaptic consolidation mechanism. Overall, our results provide a mechanistic explanation of how filopodia and spines could cooperate to overcome the difficulties that these separate forms of learning (additive and multiplicative) each have.\n\nAuthor SummaryChanges in the strength of synaptic connections between neurons are the basis of learning in biological and artificial networks. In animals, these changes can only depend on locally available signals, and are usually modeled with learning rules. Based on recent discoveries on filopodia, a special type of synaptic structure, we propose a new learning rule called Filopodium-Spine spike-timing-dependent-plasticity. Our rule proposes that filopodia follow additive STDP and spines (mature synapses) multiplicative STDP. We show that our model overcomes classic difficulties that these learning rules have separately, like the absence of stability or specificity, and can also be seen as a first stage of synaptic consolidation.",

    "abstract": "Natural metabolism relies on chemical compartmentalization of two redox cofactors, NAD+ and NADP+, to orchestrate life-essential redox reaction directions. However, in whole cells the reliance on these canonical cofactors limits flexible control of redox reaction direction as these reactions are permanently tied to catabolism or anabolism. In cell-free systems, NADP+ is too expensive in large scale. We have previously reported the use of nicotinamide mononucleotide, (NMN+) as a low-cost, noncanonical redox cofactor capable of specific electron delivery to diverse chemistries.\n\nHere, we present Nox Ortho, an NMNH-specific water-forming oxidase, that completes the toolkit to modulate NMNH/NMN+ ratio. This work uncovers an enzyme design principle that succeeds in parallel engineering of six butanediol dehydrogenases as NMN(H)-orthogonal biocatalysts consistently with a 103 - 106 -fold cofactor specificity switch from NAD(P)+ to NMN+. We combine these to produce chiral-pure 2,3-butanediol (Bdo) isomers without interference from NAD(H) or NADP(H) in vitro and in E. coli cells. We establish that NMN(H) can be held at a distinct redox ratio on demand, decoupled from both NAD(H) and NADP(H) redox ratios in vitro and in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Bird plumage coloration is a complex and multi-factorial process that involves both genetic and environmental factors. Diverse pigment groups contribute to plumage variation in different birds. In parrots, the predominant green color results from the combination of two different primary colors-yellow and blue. Psittacofulvin, a pigment uniquely found in parrots, is responsible for the yellow coloration, while blue is suggested to be the result of light scattering by feather nanostructures and melanin granules. So far, genetic control of melanin-mediated blue coloration has been elusive. In this study, we demonstrated that feather from the yellow mutant rose-ringed parakeet displays loss of melanosome granules in spongy layer of feather barb. Using whole genome sequencing, we found that mutation in SLC45A2, an important solute carrier protein in melanin synthetic pathway, is responsible for the sex-linked yellow phenotype in rose-ringed parakeet. Intriguingly, one of the mutations, P53L found in yellow P. krameri is already reported as P58A/S in the human albinism database, known to be associated with human OCA4. We further showed that mutations in SLC45A2 gene affect melanin production also in other members of Psittaculidae family such as alexandrine, and plum-headed parakeets. Additionally, we demonstrate that the mutations associated with the sex-linked yellow phenotype, localized within the transmembrane domains of the SLC45A2 protein, affect the protein localization pattern. This is the first evidence of plumage color variation involving SLC45A2 in parrots and confirmation of associated mutations in the transmembrane domains of the protein that affect its localization.\n\nArticle SummaryThe vibrant green tone of parrot plumage emerges from a blend of yellow and blue. While yellow comes from a unique pigment psittacofulvin, the genetics of blue structural color has puzzled scientists. Through novel genetic study, here we identified mutations in SLC45A2 gene, causing loss of melanin in feathers that contributes to the blue structural color. This insight opens a new chapter in understanding avian coloration and the complex interplay of feather microstructure and genetics in natures palette.",

    "abstract": "Molecular/genetic methods are becoming increasingly important for surveillance of diseases like malaria. Such methods allow to monitor routes of disease transmission or the origin and spread of variants associated with drug resistance. A confounding factor in molecular disease surveillance is the presence of multiple distinct variants in the same infection (multiplicity of infection - MOI), which leads to ambiguity when reconstructing which pathogenic variants are present in an infection. Heuristic approaches often ignore ambiguous infections, which leads to biased results. To avoid such bias, we introduce a statistical framework to estimate haplotype frequencies alongside MOI from a pair of multi-allelic molecular markers. Estimates are based on maximum-likelihood using the expectation-maximization (EM)-algorithm. The estimates can be used as plug-ins to construct pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) maps. The finite-sample properties of the proposed method are studied by systematic numerical simulations. These reveal that the EM-algorithm is a numerically stable method in our case and that the proposed method is accurate (little bias) and precise (small variance) for a reasonable sample size. In fact, the results suggest that the estimator is asymptotically unbiased. Furthermore, the method is appropriate to estimate LD (by D', r2, Q*, or conditional asymmetric LD). Furthermore, as an illustration, we apply the new method to a previously-published dataset from Cameroon concerning sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance. The results are in accordance with the SP drug pressure at the time and the observed spread of resistance in the country, yielding further evidence for the adequacy of the proposed method. The method is particularly useful for deriving LD maps from data with many ambiguous observations due to MOI. Importantly, the method per se is not restricted to malaria, but applicable to any disease with a similar transmission pattern. The method and several extensions are implemented in an easy-to-use R script.\n\nAuthor summaryAdvances in genetics render molecular disease surveillance increasingly popular. Unlike traditional incidence-based epidemiological data, genetic information provides fine-grained resolution, which allows monitoring and reconstructing routes of transmission, the spread of drug resistance, etc. Molecular surveillance is particularly popular in highly relevant diseases such as malaria. The presence of multiple distinct pathogenic variants within one infection, i.e., multiplicity of infection (MOI), is a confounding factor hampering the analysis of molecular data in the context of disease surveillance. Namely, due to MOI ambiguity concerning the pathogenic variants being present in mixed-clone infections arise. These are often disregarded by heuristic approaches to molecular disease surveillance and lead to biased results. To avoid such bias we introduce a method to estimate the distribution of MOI and frequencies of pathogenic variants based on a concise probabilistic model. The method is designed for two multi-allelic genetic markers, which is the appropriate genetic architecture to derive pairwise linkage-disequilibrium maps, which are informative on population structure or evolutionary processes, such as the spread of drug resistance. We validate the appropriateness of our method by numerical simulations and apply it to a malaria dataset from Cameroon, concerning sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance, the drug used for intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "High myopia (HM) is a severe form of refractive error that results in irreversible visual impairment and even blindness. However, the genetic and pathological mechanisms underlying this condition are not yet fully understood. From a adolescents myopia survey cohort of 1015 HM patients, pathogenic missense mutations were identified in the ZC3H11A gene in four patients by whole exome sequencing. This gene is a zinc finger and stress-induced protein that plays a significant role in regulating nuclear mRNA export. To better understand the function and molecular pathogenesis of myopia in relation to gene mutations, a Zc3h11a knock-out (KO) mouse model was created. The heterozygous KO (Het-KO) mice exhibited significant shifts in vision towards myopia. Electroretinography revealed that the b-wave amplitude was significantly lower in these mice under dark adaptation. Using immunofluorescence antibodies against specific retinal cell types, the density of bipolar cell-labelled proteins was found to be decreased. Transmission electron microscopy findings suggesting ultrastructural abnormalities of the retina and sclera. Retinal transcriptome sequencing showed that 769 genes were differentially expressed, and Zc3h11a was found to have a negative impact on the PI3K-AKT and NF-{kappa}B signalling pathways by quantitative PCR and western blotting. In addition, myopia-related factors, including TGF-{beta}1, MMP-2 and IL-6 were found to be upregulated in the retina or sclera. In summary, this study characterized a new pathogenic gene associated with HM. The findings indicated that the ZC3H11A protein may serve as an innate immune and inflammatory response trigger, contributing to the early onset of myopia. These findings offer potential therapeutic intervention targets for controlling the development of HM.",

    "abstract": "Populations of bacterial pathogens are made of strains that often have variable gene content, termed the pangenome. Variations in the genetic makeup of a single strain can alter bacterial physiology and fitness in response to different environmental stimuli. To define biologically relevant genes within a genome, genome-wide knockout transposon mutant libraries have been used to identify genes essential for survival or virulence in a particular strain. Such phenotypic studies have been applied in four different genotypes of the major human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes, yet challenges exist in comparing results across studies conducted in different genetic backgrounds and conditions. To advance genotype-phenotype inferences within a population genomic framework of 250 S. pyogenes reference genomes, we systematically re-analysed publicly available transposon sequencing datasets from S. pyogenes using a transposon sequencing specific analysis pipeline, Transit. Across 4 genetic backgrounds and 9 phenotypic conditions, 311 genes were highly essential for survival, corresponding to [~]22% of the core genome. Among the 311 genes, functions related to information storage, and processing were overrepresented. Genes associated with cellular processing and signalling were of significantly higher essentiality under in vivo conditions (animal models with differing disease manifestation and site of colonisation) compared to in vitro (varying types of culture media). Finally, essential operons across S. pyogenes genotypes were defined, with an increased number of essential operons detected under in vivo conditions. This study provides an extendible database to which new studies can be added, and a searchable html-based resource to direct future investigations into S. pyogenes population biology.\n\nImportanceStreptococcus pyogenes is a human adapted pathogen occupying restricted ecological niches. Understanding essentiality of genes across different strains and experimental conditions is important to direct research questions and efforts to prevent the large burden of disease caused by S. pyogenes. To this end we systematically reanalysed transposon sequencing studies in S. pyogenes using transposon sequencing specific methods, integrating them into an extendible meta-analysis framework.

It faces multiple threats, the most significant one being habitat loss due to deforestation in western Ecuador. Genomic tools are key for the management of endangered species, but this requires a reference genome which until now was unavailable for A. f. fusciceps. The present study reports the first whole genome sequence and assembly of A. f. fusciceps generated using Oxford Nanopore long reads. DNA was extracted from a subadult male and libraries were prepared for sequencing following the Ligation Sequencing Kit SQK-LSK112 workflow. Sequencing was performed using a MinION Mk1C sequencer. The sequencing reads were processed to generate a genome assembly. Two different assemblers were used to obtain draft genomes using raw reads, of which the Flye assembly was found to be superior. The final assembly has a total length of 2.63 Gb and contains 3,861 contigs, with an N50 of 7,560,531 bp. The assembly was analyzed for annotation completeness based on primate ortholog prediction using a high-resolution database, and was found to be 84.3% complete, with a low number of duplicated genes indicating a precise assembly. The annotation of the assembly predicted 31,417 protein-coding genes, comparable to other mammal assemblies. A reference genome for this critically endangered species will allow researchers to gain insight into the genetics of its populations and thus aid conservation and management efforts of this vulnerable species.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance remains an urgent and growing global health problem. Peptides with antimicrobial activity are widespread in nature but are rarely harnessed for application, making them an underexplored and untapped resource. Many harbor post-translational modifications, which are essential for function and have evolved alongside specialized export and immunity machineries - leading to the current paradigm that natural sequences cannot be changed, and curtailing their development as antimicrobial agents. Nonetheless, we found sufficient ambiguity in literature to question if that remained true for E. coli MccB17. We demonstrate that its natural machinery for synthesis, export and immunity, can be co-opted as a platform for novel azole-modified antimicrobial peptide discovery. We show that the sequence space available for exploration is large and densely populated with functional sequences.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryE. coli can be harnessed as an in vivo platform for the isolation of novel antimicrobial azole-modified peptides.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a complex psychiatric condition in which cortical, subcortical and neuromodulatory alterations have been implicated in its symptom expression. Long standing views of schizophrenia symptoms have posed that alterations in catecholaminergic systems, which explain psychotic symptoms, may be also associated with the cognitive impairments commonly observed in this condition. However, evidence on the involvement of catecholaminergic regions on cognitive functions in schizophrenia remains scarce. Working memory is one cognitive domain where schizophrenia patients present more impairments at higher levels of cognitive load. Here we explored the activation of catecholaminergic regions during a working memory task in schizophrenia. We reanalyzed an openly available functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset where schizophrenia patients and healthy controls were scanned while performing the N-back task. We compared activation of two dopaminergic areas, ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra, and of a noradrenergic nucleus, locus coeruleus, to the presentation of targets, and compared three different levels of cognitive load (0-, 1- and 2-back). We found that across nuclei, higher load was related to lower activation. Furthermore, schizophrenia patients showed reduced activation at the highest load level when compared to healthy controls. These findings point to catecholaminergic systems as mediators of the deficits in effort processing in schizophrenia. Our study lends further support for the importance of including catecholaminergic systems in the mechanisms of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Cortico-hippocampal interaction is integral to memory consolidation during sleep or wakeful rest. However, the extent of its engagement in non-declarative motor memory during skill learning remains largely undefined. Specifically, it remains unclear how neural representations in cortical and hippocampal regions are related to learning multiple motor sequences. Here, we conducted an fMRI experiment in which participants learned four distinct motor sequences in a pseudo-random order with interleaved rest periods. We found pattern separation in the sensorimotor regions was significant, particularly in the anterior motor cortex, related to early learning performance. However, there was no pattern separation in the hippocampus during the rest periods. Intriguingly, the representational similarity between the motor cortex during task periods and the hippocampus during rest periods was highly correlated with overall learning performance. These findings suggest a new role of hippocampal replay in motor sequence learning, that is, learning a more abstract relational structure of sequences instead of representing sequences per se.",

    "abstract": "Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a homo-trimeric clamp complex that serves as the molecular hub for various DNA transactions, including DNA synthesis and post-replicative mismatch repair. Its timely loading and unloading are critical for genome stability. PCNA loading is catalyzed by Replication factor C (RFC) and the Ctf18 RFC-like complex (Ctf18-RLC), and its unloading is catalyzed by Atad5/Elg1-RLC. However, RFC, Ctf18-RLC, and even some subcomplexes of their shared subunits are capable of unloading PCNA in vitro, leaving an ambiguity in the division of labor in eukaryotic clamp dynamics. By using a system that specifically detects PCNA unloading, we show here that Atad5-RLC, which accounts for only approximately 3% of RFC/RLCs, nevertheless provides the major PCNA unloading activity in Xenopus egg extracts. RFC and Ctf18-RLC each account for approximately 40% of RFC/RLCs, while immunodepletion of neither Rfc1 nor Ctf18 detectably affects the rate of PCNA unloading in our system. PCNA unloading is dependent on the ATP-binding motif of Atad5, independent of nicks on DNA and chromatin assembly, and inhibited effectively by PCNA-interacting peptides. These results support a model in which Atad5-RLC preferentially unloads DNA-bound PCNA molecules that are free from their interactors.",

    "abstract": "Alternative splicing dramatically increases the repertoire of the human transcriptome and plays a critical role in cellular differentiation. Long read sequencing has dramatically improved our ability to explore isoform diversity directly. However, short read sequencing still provides advantages in terms of sequencing depth at low cost, which is important in comparative quantitative studies. Here, we present a pipeline called ASTA-P for profiling, quantification, and differential splicing analysis of tissue-specific, arbitrarily complex alternative splicing patterns. We discover novel events by supplementing existing annotation with reconstructed transcripts and use spliced RNA-seq reads to quantify splicing changes accurately based on their unique assignments. We used simulated RNA-seq data to demonstrate that ASTA-P provides a good trade-off between discovery and accuracy compared with several popular methods. Further, we applied ASTA-P to analyse AS patterns in real data from hiPSC derived cranial neural crest cells capturing the transition from primary neural cells into migratory cranial neural crest cells, differentiated by their expression of the transcription factor, SOX10. Our analysis revealed a significant splicing complexity, i.e., numerous AS events that cannot be described using the conventionally analysed 2D splicing event patterns. Such events are misclassified when analysed using current differential splicing analysis methods. Thus, ASTA-P provides a new approach for studying both conventional and complex splicing across different cellular conditions and the dynamic regulation of AS.

SIMVI enables novel downstream analyses, such as clustering and differential expression analysis based on disentangled representations, spatial effect (SE) identification, SE interpretation, and transfer learning on new measurements / modalities. We benchmarked SIMVI on both simulated and real datasets and show that SIMVI uniquely generates highly accurate SE inferences in synthetic datasets and unveils intrinsic variation in complex real datasets. We applied SIMVI to spatial omics data from diverse platforms and tissues (MERFISH human cortex / mouse liver, Slide-seqv2 mouse hippocampus, Spatial-ATAC-RNA-seq) and revealed various region-specific and cell-type-specific spatial interactions. In addition, our experiments on MERFISH human cortex and spatial-ATAC-RNA-seq showcased SIMVIs power in identifying SEs for new samples / modalities.

Here, we reported that intermittent fasting promoted IL-22 production by ILC3s and subsequent beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s increased beigeing of white adipose tissue in diet-induced-obese mice. Exogenous IL-22 significantly increased the beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Deficiency of IL-22 receptor attenuated the beigeing induced by intermittent fasting. Single-cell sequencing of sorted intestinal immune cells revealed that intermittent fasting increased aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling in ILC3s. Analysis of cell-cell ligand receptor interactions indicated that intermittent fasting may stimulate the interaction of ILC3s with dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. These results establish the role of intestinal ILC3s in beigeing of white adipose tissue, suggesting that ILC3/IL-22/IL-22R axis contributes to the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting.",

    "abstract": "Paramutation is the transfer of mitotically and meiotically heritable silencing information between two alleles. With paramutation at the maize booster1 (b1) locus, the low expressed B epiallele heritably changes the high expressed B-I epiallele into B with 100% frequency. This requires specific tandem repeats and multiple components of the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway, including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP, mediator of paramutation1, MOP1), the second-largest subunit of RNA polymerase IV and V (NRP(D/E)2a, mediator of paramutation2, MOP2), and the largest subunit of RNA Polymerase IV (NRPD1, mediator of paramutation3, MOP3). Mutations in mop genes prevent paramutation and release silencing at the B epiallele. In this study we investigated the effect of mutations in mop1, mop2 and mop3 on chromatin structure and DNA methylation at the B epiallele, and especially the regulatory hepta-repeat 100 kb upstream of the b1 gene.\n\nWe show that mutations in mop1 and mop3 result in decreased repressive histone modifications H3K9me2 and H3K27me2 at the hepta-repeat. Associated with this decrease are partial activation of the hepta-repeat enhancer function, formation of a multi-loop structure, and elevated b1 expression. In mop2 mutants, which do not show elevated b1 expression, H3K9me2 and H3K27me2 and a single-loop structure like in wild type B are retained. Surprisingly, high DNA methylation levels at the B hepta-repeat remains in all three mutants. Our results raise the possibility of MOP factors mediating RNA-directed histone methylation rather than RNA-directed DNA methylation at the b1 locus.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAutologous buccal mucosal tissue derived cell transplantation techniques in repairing a stricture inflicted male urethral epithelium have been evolving. There was not much of clarity on the cell type, in vitro culture methods and the mode of transplantation, until we reported our buccal epithelium expanded and encapsulated in scaffold-hybrid approach to urethral stricture (BEES-HAUS) clinical study yielding a successful engraftment and repair with a long-term patency. We herein report with technical clarity on the advantages of mixing two-dimensional (2D) monolayer cultured fibroblast like cells and three dimensional (3D) thermo-reversible gelation polymer (TGP) cultured cells; the former secreting IGF-1, a cytokine known for its healing effects and the latter expressing epithelial surface markers in flow cytometry, both sourced from human buccal tissue, together transplanted using TGP as a carrier.\n\nMethodsHuman buccal tissues (n=22) redundant after urethroplasty surgery was used after informed consent and IEC approval. They were enzyme digested, divided into two portions; one was cultured as monolayer method (2D) and the other in 3D in TGP. Flowcytometry and quantification of IGF-1 in cell culture supernatant through the culture period were undertaken.\n\nResultsIn flowcytometry, the cells on day 0, lacked AE1/AE3 - pancytokeratin expression indicative of epithelial phenotype of culture, which progressively increased in the 3D-TGP group, during invitro culture of up to 21 days. The 2D showed expression of only fibroblasts like cells that were negative for AE1/AE3 but positive for CD140b. IGF-1 secretion was significantly higher in 2D cultures than in 3D-TGP (p-value < 0.05).\n\nConclusionThe 3D- TGP cultured cells of epithelial nature and the 2D cultured fibroblast like cells secreting IGF-1, together when transplanted using TGP scaffold as a carrier, adapted to a hostile in vivo milieu after releasing the fibrous strands with urethrotomy, successfully engrafted and repaired a stricture-inflicted male urethral epithelium in the BEES-HAUS procedure.

    "abstract": "In the context of epilepsy studies, intracranially-recorded interictal high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in EEG signals are emerging as promising spatial neurophysiological biomarkers for epileptogenic zones. While significant efforts have been made in identifying and understanding these biomarkers, deep learning is carving novel avenues for biomarker detection and analysis. Yet, transitioning such methodologies to clinical environments is difficult due to the rigorous computational needs of processing EEG data via deep learning. This paper presents our development of an advanced end to end software platform, PyHFO, aimed at bridging this gap. PyHFO provides an integrated and user-friendly platform that includes time-efficient HFO detection algorithms such as short-term energy (STE) and Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital (MNI) detectors and deep learning models for artifact and HFO with spike classification. This application functions seamlessly on conventional computer hardware. Our platform has been validated to adeptly handle datasets from 10-minute EEG recordings captured via grid/strip electrodes in 19 patients. Through implementation optimization, PyHFO achieves speeds up to 50 times faster than the standard HFO detection method. Users can either employ our pre-trained deep learning model for their analyses or use their EEG data to train their model. As such, PyHFO holds great promise for facilitating the use of advanced EEG data analysis tools in clinical practice and large-scale research collaborations.",

    "abstract": "Cell division in bacteria is initiated by constriction of the Z-ring comprising two essential proteins FtsZ and FtsA. Despite our knowledge about the crucial function of the Z-ring in bacterial division, the precise roles and mechanism of how FtsZ and FtsA drive cell constriction remain elusive. FtsZ/FtsA in wall-less bacteria like mycoplasmas is an ideal model system for obtaining mechanistic insights into Z-ring constriction in the absence of cell wall machinery. In this study, we have analyzed FtsZ and FtsA sequences of 113 mycoplasma species and compared with the corresponding protein sequences in cell-walled bacteria. We report a phylogenetically distinct group of 12 species that possess FtsZs without the canonical FtsA interacting conserved C-terminal peptide (CCTP) motif. Interestingly, these FtsZs contain a putative membrane-binding amphipathic helix as an N-terminal or C-terminal extension to the globular FtsZ domain. As a proof-of-concept, we experimentally show that the proposed C-terminal amphipathic helix in M. genitalium FtsZ binds liposomes in vitro as well as localizes to E. coli membrane in vivo. Additionally, we identify a putative cholesterol recognition motif within the C-terminal amphipathic helix region of M. genitalium FtsZ. Our study catalogues the functional variations of membrane attachment by the FtsZ and FtsA system in cell wall-less mycoplasmas and provides a new perspective to study novel functions of FtsZ/A system in cell division.\n\nImportanceZ-ring and peptidoglycan synthesis machinery both play crucial roles in bacterial cell division. Currently, our knowledge about how FtsZ and FtsA, the two primary components of the Z-ring, function, is limited to cell-walled bacteria where ring constriction is coupled to peptidoglycan synthesis. Cell wall-less bacterial FtsZ/A system is an excellent model to study the mechanism of Z-ring constriction in the absence of cell wall synthesis machinery. Here, we analysed FtsZ protein sequences across mycoplasma species and identified their characteristic sequence features. Our study reveals a novel group of FtsZs from mycoplasma with an inherent membrane binding and probable cholesterol sensing amphipathic motif, which serves as a new paradigm to explore fundamental roles of FtsZ and FtsA in Z-ring constriction during bacterial division.",

We found that MLKL is activated in an atypical, RIPK3- and necroptosis-independent manner downstream of Toll-like receptor 3, resulting in its translocation to lysosomes and lysosomal membrane permeabilization. Damaged lysosomes then undergo exocytosis, leading to the integration of lysosomal MLKL into the plasma-membrane to trigger cell death. The ESCRT-machinery can repair damaged lysosomes and counteract cell death by packing lysosomal MLKL into intraluminal vesicles, which are subsequently released as extracellular vesicles. In this way, ESCRT-machinery balances life and death decisions by preventing lysosomal MLKL to reach its killing destination, which is the plasma-membrane.",

    "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are used as novel therapeutic tools in cell-based therapies including diabetic complications. However, diabetes may negatively affect the therapeutic potential of autologous MSCs. In order to enhance the utilization of diabetic MSCs, better characterization of their angiogenic capacity should be performed. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of diabetes mellitus (DM) on the angiogenic potential of bone marrow derived MSCs. MSCs were isolated from DM subjects and were compared with MSCs isolated from non-DM subjects. The angiogenic potential of MSCs was assessed in which there was insignificant difference in the proliferation and expression of angiogenic factors between the two groups. Moreover, no statistically significant change was found in the viability and angiogenic activities of endothelial cells isolated from both groups. Results indicate that the hyperglycemic milieu had no significant impact on the angiogenic-related functional properties of MSCs and they are able to survive the harsh diabetic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Targeted protein degradation (TPD) is a powerful technique for regulation of protein homeostasis. Current TPD mainly focuses on the therapeutical consequences rather than the operation processes of the molecular tools. Herein, we construct a platform for precisely manipulate the protein degradation by activatable lysosome targeting DNA nanodevices. In the design, a lysosome-targeting CD63 aptamer is locked by the single-stranded DNA with a photocleavable group and a disulfide bond. This locked CD63 aptamer is connected with the aptamer targeting the protein of interest via double-stranded DNA linkages to form the logic-gate activated lysosome targeting DNA nanodevice (LALTD). With the UV light and endogenous GSH as inputs, AND logic-gate is built to efficiently manipulate the protein delivery processes by LALTD. The protein of interest could be degraded via efficient lysosome hydrolysis. Further studies shows that the logic-gate operation could be used for modulating the T cell-mediated antitumor immunity. The modularly designed activatable lysosome targeting DNA nanodevices exhibits good stability, controllability, programmability and universality, providing a new prospect for accurate protein degradation and precise therapy.\n\nEntry for the Table of ContentsThrough rational integration of dual molecular switches with bispecific aptamer systems, a logic-gate activated lysosome targeting DNA nanodevice (LALTD) was developed for precisely controlled process of protein hydrolysis in living cells.

    "abstract": "The stability of tight junctions (TJs) between endothelial cells (ECs) is essential to maintain blood-brain barrier (BBB) function in the healthy brain. Following ischemic stroke, TJ strand dismantlement due to protein degradation leads to BBB dysfunction, yet the mechanisms driving this process are poorly understood. Here, we show that endothelial-specific ablation of Rab7a, a small GTPase that regulates endolysosomal protein degradation, reduces stroke-induced TJ strand disassembly resulting in decreased paracellular BBB permeability and improved neuronal outcomes. Two pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF and IL1{beta}, but not glucose and oxygen deprivation, induce Rab7a activation via Ccz1 in brain ECs in vitro, leading to increased TJ protein degradation and impaired paracellular barrier function. Silencing Rab7a in brain ECs in vitro reduces cytokine-driven endothelial barrier dysfunction by suppressing degradation of a key BBB TJ protein, Claudin-5. Thus, Rab7a activation by inflammatory cytokines promotes degradation of select TJ proteins leading to BBB dysfunction after ischemic stroke.",

    "abstract": "Cell surface biomarkers are fundamental for specific characterization of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). Importantly, they can be applied for hPSC enrichment and/or purification but also to remove potentially teratoma-forming hPSCs from differentiated populations before clinical application. Several specific markers for hPSCs are glycoconjugates comprising the glycosphingolipid (GSL)-based glycans SSEA-3 and SSEA-4. We applied an analytical approach based on multiplexed capillary gel electrophoresis coupled to laser-induced fluorescence detection to quantitatively assess the GSL glycome of human embryonic stem cells and human induced pluripotent stem cells as well as during early stages of differentiation into mesoderm, endoderm, and ectoderm. Thereby, we identified the GSL lacto-N-tetraosylceramide (Lc4-Cer, Gal{beta}1-3GlcNAc{beta}1-3Gal{beta}1-4Glc-Cer), which comprises a terminal type 1 LacNAc (T1LN) structure (Gal{beta}1-3GlcNAc), to be rapidly decreased upon onset of differentiation. Using a specific antibody, we could confirm a decline of T1LN-terminating glycans during the first four days of differentiation by live-cell staining and subsequent flow cytometry. We could further separate T1LN-positive and T1LN-negative cells out of a mixed population of pluripotent and differentiated cells by magnetic activated cell sorting. Notably, not only the T1LN-positive but also the T1LN-negative population was positive for SSEA-3, SSEA-4, and SSEA-5 while expression of nuclear pluripotency markers OCT4 and NANOG was highly reduced in the T1LN-negative population, exclusively. Our findings suggest T1LN as a pluripotent stem cell-specific glycan epitope that is more rapidly down-regulated upon differentiation than SSEA-3, SSEA-4, and SSEA-5.",

    "abstract": "PLC{beta} enzymes cleave PIP2 producing IP3 and DAG. PIP2 modulates the function of many ion channels, while IP3 and DAG regulate intracellular Ca2+ levels and protein phosphorylation by protein kinase C, respectively. PLC{beta} enzymes are under the control of GPCR signaling through direct interactions with G proteins G{beta}{gamma} and Gq and have been shown to be coincidence detectors for dual stimulation of Gq and Gi coupled receptors. PLC{beta}s are aqueous-soluble cytoplasmic enzymes, but partition onto the membrane surface to access their lipid substrate, complicating their functional and structural characterization. Using newly developed methods, we recently showed that G{beta}{gamma} activates PLC{beta}3 by recruiting it to the membrane. Using these same methods, here we show that Gq increases the catalytic rate constant, kcat, of PLC{beta}3. Since stimulation of PLC{beta}3 by Gq depends on an autoinhibitory element (the X-Y linker), we propose that Gq produces partial relief of the X-Y linker autoinhibition through an allosteric mechanism. We also determined membrane-bound structures of the PLC{beta}3-Gq, and PLC{beta}3-G{beta}{gamma}(2)-Gq complexes, which show that these G proteins can bind simultaneously and independently of each other to regulate PLC{beta}3 activity. The structures rationalize a finding in the enzyme assay, that co-stimulation by both G proteins follows a product rule of each independent stimulus. We conclude that baseline activity of PLC{beta}3 is strongly suppressed, but the effect of G proteins, especially acting together, provides a robust stimulus upon G protein stimulation.\n\nSignificance StatementFor certain cellular signaling processes, the background activity of signaling enzymes must be minimal and stimulus-dependent activation robust. Nowhere is this truer than in signaling by PLC{beta}3, whose activity regulates intracellular Ca2+, phosphorylation by Protein Kinase C, and the activity of numerous ion channels and membrane receptors. In this study we show how PLC{beta}3 enzymes are regulated by two kinds of G proteins, G{beta}{gamma} and Gq. Enzyme activity studies and structures on membranes show how these G proteins act by separate, independent mechanisms, leading to a product rule of co-stimulation when they act together. The findings explain how cells achieve robust stimulation of PLC{beta}3 in the setting of very low background activity, properties essential to cell health and survival.",

    "abstract": "The cytoskeletal protein actin plays a critical role in the pathogenicity of Toxoplasma gondii, mediating invasion and egress, cargo transport, and organelle inheritance. Advances in live cell imaging have revealed extensive filamentous actin networks in the Apicomplexan parasite, but there is conflicting data regarding the biochemical and biophysical properties of Toxoplasma actin. Here, we imaged the in vitro assembly of individual Toxoplasma actin filaments in real time, showing that native, unstabilized filaments grow tens of microns in length. Unlike skeletal muscle actin, Toxoplasma filaments intrinsically undergo rapid treadmilling due to a high critical concentration, fast monomer dissociation, and rapid nucleotide exchange. Cryo-EM structures of stabilized and unstabilized filaments show an architecture like skeletal actin, with differences in assembly contacts in the D-loop that explain the dynamic nature of the filament, likely a conserved feature of Apicomplexan actin. This work demonstrates that evolutionary changes at assembly interfaces can tune dynamic properties of actin filaments without disrupting their conserved structure.",

    "abstract": "Oncogenic KRAS mutations are well-described functionally and are known to drive tumorigenesis. Recent reports describe a significant prevalence of KRAS allelic imbalances or gene dosage changes in human cancers, including loss of the wild-type allele in KRAS mutant cancers. However, there is still much debate over the function of wild-type KRAS in tumour initiation, progression and therapeutic response. We have developed a genetically engineered mouse model which allows deletion of the wild-type copy of Kras in the context of an intact oncogenic Kras in colorectal cancer. We observe that in the presence of oncogenic Kras, wild-type Kras acts to restrain tumour growth. Mechanistically, deletion of wild-type Kras exacerbates oncogenic KRAS signalling through MAPK and thus drives tumour initiation. Absence of wild-type Kras potentiates the oncogenic effect of KRASG12D, while presence of wild-type Kras is associated with resistance to inhibition of MEK1/2 in KRASG12D driven tumours. Importantly, loss of wild-type Kras in oncogenic KRAS-driven aggressive tumours significantly alters tumour progression, metastasis while impacting tumour immune cell infiltration. This study demonstrates a suppressive role for wild-type Kras during colon tumour initiation and highlights the critical impact of wild-type Kras upon therapeutic response to MAPK and tumour progression in Kras mutant cancers.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWild-type KRAS suppresses mutant KRASG12D mediated proliferation and signalling in colorectal cancer models in vivo\nC_LIO_LIConcomitant loss of wild-type KRAS and activation of WNT signalling promotes mutant KRAS-driven tumour initiation.\nC_LIO_LIWild-type KRAS promotes resistance to MAPK inhibition in KRAS mutant tumours\nC_LIO_LILoss of wild-type KRAS inhibits metastasis of late-stage mutant KRAS colorectal cancer models.\nC_LI",

The complexity of signaling is a barrier to understanding the pathways that control any particular function. In this work, we use a novel combination of approaches and a new click chemistry probe to determine the role of one pathway in regulating cell surface expression of an ion channel and a receptor tyrosine kinase. We applied an optogenetic approach to uncouple activation of the PI3K pathway from other pathways downstream of RTK activation. In this context, we used genetic code expansion to introduce a click chemistry noncanonical amino acid into the extracellular side of membrane proteins. Applying a cell-impermeant click chemistry fluorophore allowed us to visualize delivery of membrane proteins to the PM in real time. Using these approaches, we demonstrate that activation of PI3K, without activating other pathways downstream of RTK signaling, is sufficient to traffic the TRPV1 ion channels and insulin receptors to the plasma membrane.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMitral valve (MV) disease including myxomatous degeneration is the most common form of valvular heart disease with an age-dependent frequency. Genetic evidence indicates mutations of the transcription factor FOXC1 are associated with MV defects, including mitral valve regurgitation. In this study, we sought to determine whether murine Foxc1 and its closely related factor, Foxc2, are required in valvular endothelial cells (VECs) for the maintenance of MV leaflets, including VEC junctions and the stratified trilaminar extracellular matrix (ECM).\n\nMethodsAdult mice carrying tamoxifen-inducible, endothelial cell (EC)-specific, compound Foxc1;Foxc2 mutations (i.e., EC-Foxc-DKO mice) were used to study the function of Foxc1 and Foxc2 in the maintenance of mitral valves. The EC-mutations of Foxc1/c2 were induced at 7 - 8 weeks of age by tamoxifen treatment, and abnormalities in the MVs of EC-Foxc-DKO mice were assessed via whole-mount immunostaining, immunohistochemistry, and Movat pentachrome/Massons Trichrome staining.\n\nResultsEC-deletions of Foxc1 and Foxc2 in mice resulted in abnormally extended and thicker mitral valves by causing defects in regulation of ECM organization with increased proteoglycan and decreased collagen. Notably, reticular adherens junctions were found in VECs of control MV leaflets, and these reticular structures were severely disrupted in EC-Foxc1/c2 mutant mice. PROX1, a key regulator in a subset of VECs on the fibrosa side of MVs, was downregulated in EC-Foxc1/c2 mutant VECs. Furthermore, we determined the precise location of lymphatic vessels in murine MVs, and these lymphatic vessels were aberrantly expanded in EC-Foxc1/c2 mutant mitral valves.\n\nConclusionsOur results indicate that Foxc1 and Foxc2 are required for maintaining the integrity of the MV, including VEC junctions, ECM organization, and lymphatic vessels to prevent myxomatous mitral valve degeneration.",

    "abstract": "Computational drug discovery is intrinsically interdisciplinary and has to deal with the multifarious factors which are often dependent on the type of disease. Molecular Property Diagnostic Suite (MPDS) is a Galaxy based web portal which was conceived and developed as a disease specific web portal, originally developed for tuberculosis (MPDSTB). As specific computational tools are often required for a given disease, developing a disease specific web portal is highly desirable. This paper emphasises on the development of the customised web portal for COVID-19 infection and is referred to as MPDSCOVID-19. Expectedly, the MPDS suites of programs have modules which are essentially independent of a given disease, whereas some modules are specific to a particular disease. In the MPDSCOVID-19 portal, there are modules which are specific to COVID-19, and these are clubbed in SARS-COV-2 disease library. Further, the new additions and/or significant improvements were made to the disease independent modules, besides the addition of tools from galaxy toolshed. This manuscript provides a latest update on the disease independent modules of MPDS after almost 6 years, as well as provide the contemporary information and tool-shed necessary to engage in the drug discovery research of COVID-19. The disease independent modules include file format converter and descriptor calculation under the data processing module; QSAR, pharmacophore, scaffold analysis, active site analysis, docking, screening, drug repurposing tool, virtual screening, visualisation, sequence alignment, phylogenetic analysis under the data analysis module; and various machine learning packages, algorithms and in-house developed machine learning antiviral prediction model are available. The MPDS suite of programs are expected to bring a paradigm shift in computational drug discovery, especially in the academic community, guided through a transparent and open innovation approach.

    "abstract": "Adverse neurological and psychiatric outcomes, collectively termed the post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), persist in adults clinically recovered from COVID-19. Effective therapeutic interventions are fundamental to reducing the burden of PASC, necessitating an investigation of the pathophysiology underlying the debilitating neurological symptoms associated with the condition. Herein, eight non-human primates (Wild-Caught African Green Monkeys, n=4; Indian Rhesus Macaques, n=4) were inoculated with the SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020 by either small particle aerosol or via multiple routes. At necropsy, tissue from the olfactory epithelium and pyriform cortex/amygdala of SARS-CoV-2 infected non-human primates were collected for ribonucleic acid in situ hybridization (i.e., RNAscope). First, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) mRNA are downregulated in the pyriform cortex/amygdala of non-human primates clinically recovered from SARS-CoV-2 inoculation relative to wildtype controls. Second, abundant SARS-CoV-2 mRNA was detected in clinically recovered non-human primates; mRNA which is predominantly harbored in pericytes. Collectively, examination of post-mortem pyriform cortex/amygdala brain tissue of non-human primates clinically recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection revealed two early pathophysiological mechanisms potentially underlying PASC. Indeed, therapeutic interventions targeting the downregulation of ACE2, decreased expression of TMPRSS2, and/or persistent infection of pericytes in the central nervous system may effectively mitigate the debilitating symptoms of PASC.",

    "abstract": "Immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2 paired with immune imprinting from monovalent mRNA vaccines has resulted in attenuated neutralizing antibody responses against Omicron subvariants. In this study, we characterized two new XBB variants rising in circulation -- EG.5.1 and XBB.2.3, for their ability of neutralization and syncytia formation. We determined the neutralizing antibody in sera of individuals that received a bivalent mRNA vaccine booster, BA.4/5-wave infection, or XBB.1.5-wave infection. Bivalent vaccination-induced antibodies neutralized efficiently ancestral D614G, but to a much less extent, two new EG.5.1 and XBB.2.3 variants. In fact, the enhanced neutralization escape of EG.5.1 appeared to be driven by its key defining mutation XBB.1.5-F456L. Notably, infection by BA.4/5 or XBB.1.5 afforded little, if any, neutralization against EG.5.1, XBB.2.3 and previous XBB variants -- especially in unvaccinated individuals, with average neutralizing antibody titers near the limit of detection. Additionally, we investigated the infectivity, fusion activity, and processing of variant spikes for EG.5.1 and XBB.2.3 in HEK293T-ACE2 and CaLu-3 cells but found no significant differences compared to earlier XBB variants. Overall, our findings highlight the continued immune evasion of new Omicron subvariants and, more importantly, the need to reformulate mRNA vaccines to include XBB spikes for better protection.",

    "abstract": "The rumen houses a diverse community that plays a major role in the digestion process in ruminants. Anaerobic gut fungi (AGF) are key contributors to plant digestion in the rumen. Here, we present a global amplicon-based survey of the rumen mycobiome by examining 206 samples from 15 animal species, 15 countries and six continents. The rumen mycobiome was highly diverse, with 81 out of 88 currently recognized AGF genera or candidate genera identified. However, only six genera (Neocallimastix, Orpinomyces, Caecomyces, Cyllamyces, NY9, and Piromyces) were present at > 4% relative abundance. AGF diversity was higher in members of the families Antilocapridae and Cervidae compared to Bovidae. Community structure analysis identified a pattern of phylosymbiosis, where host family (10% of total variance) and species (13.5%) partially explained the rumen mycobiome composition. Domestication (11.14%) and biogeography (14.1%) also partially explained AGF community structure, although sampling limitation, geographic range restrictions, and direct association between domestication status and host species hindered accurate elucidation of the relative contribution of each factor. Pairwise comparison of rumen versus fecal samples obtained from the same subject (n=13) demonstrated greater diversity and inter-sample variability in rumen over fecal samples. The genera Neocallimastix and Orpinomyces were present in higher abundance in rumen samples, while Cyllamyces and Caecomyces were enriched in fecal samples. Comparative analysis of global rumen and feces datasets revealed a similar pattern. Our results provide a global view of AGF community in the rumen and identify patterns of AGF variability between rumen and feces in herbivores tract.\n\nImportanceRuminants are highly successful and economically important mammalian suborder. Ruminants are herbivores that digest plant material with the aid of microorganisms residing in their GI tract. The rumen compartment represents the most important location where microbially-mediated plant digestion occurs in ruminants, and is known to house a bewildering array of microbial diversity. An important component of the rumen microbiome is the anaerobic gut fungi, members of the phylum Neocallimastigomycota. So far, studies examining AGF diversity have mostly employed fecal samples, and little is currently known regarding the identity of AGF residing in the rumen compartment, factors that impact the observed patterns of diversity and community structure of AGF in the rumen, and how AGF communities in the rumen compare to AGF communities in feces. Here, we examined the rumen AGF diversity using amplicon-based surveys targeting a wide range of wild and domesticated ruminants (n=206, 15 different animal species) obtained from 15 different countries. Our results demonstrate that while highly diverse, no new AGF genera were identified in the rumen mycobiome samples examined. Our analysis also indicate that animal host phylogeny plays a more important role in shaping AGF diversity in the rumen, compared to biogeography and domestication status. Finally, we demonstrate that a greater level of diversity and higher inter-sample variability was observed in rumen compared to fecal samples, with two genera (Neocallimastix and Orpinomyces) present in higher abundance in rumen samples, and two others (Cyllamyces and Caecomyces) enriched in fecal samples. Our results provide a global view of the identity, diversity, and community structure of AGF in ruminants, elucidate factors impacting diversity and community structure of the rumen mycobiome, and identify patterns of AGF community variability between the rumen and feces in the herbivorous GIT tract.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Schuster et al. demonstrated that bloodstream slender forms of African trypanosomes are readily transmissible to young tsetse flies where they can complete their complex life cycle (1). In their experimental conditions, a single slender parasite was sufficient for productive infection. Here, we compared the infectivity of slender and stumpy bloodstream forms in adult flies with a mature immune system, and without using any chemical compounds that would alter the insect immune response and/or promote the infection. After ingestion of slender forms, infected flies were observed only in one out of 24 batches of non-immunocompetent teneral flies and with a high number of parasites. In contrast, infected flies were detected in 75% (18/24) of the batches infected with stumpy parasites, and as few as 10 stumpy parasites produced mature infections in immune adult flies. We discuss that, although Schuster et al. have unequivocally demonstrated the intrinsic capacity of slender form trypanosomes to infect young and naive tsetse flies, highlighting the remarkable plasticity and adaptability of these protists, this phenomenon is unlikely to significantly contribute to the epidemiology of African trypanosomiases. According to both experimental and field observations, stumpy forms appear to be the most adapted forms for African trypanosome transmission from the mammalian host to the tsetse fly vector in natural conditions.",

    "abstract": "Enteroviruses are human pathogens known to challenge water safety1,2. Among the microbial stressors found in water, bacterial serine proteases contribute to the control of enterovirus persistence3. However, the structural interactions accounting for the susceptibility of enteroviruses to proteases remains unexplained. Here, we describe the molecular mechanisms involved in the recruitment of serine proteases to viral capsids. Among the virus types used, coxsackievirus A9 (CVA9), but not CVB5 and echovirus 11 (E11), was inactivated by Subtilisin A in a host-independent manner, while Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin (BPT) only reduced CVA9 infectivity in a host-dependent manner. Predictive interaction models of each protease with capsid protomers indicate the main targets as internal disordered protein (IDP) segments exposed either on the 5-fold vertex (DE loop VP1) or at the 5/2-fold intersection (C-terminal end VP1) of viral capsids. We further show that a functional binding protease/capsid depends on both the strength and the evolution over time of protease-VP1 complexes, and lastly on the local adaptation of proteases on surrounding viral regions. Finally, we identified three residues on CVA9 capsid that trigger cleavage by Subtilisin A, one of which acts as a sensor residue contributing to enzyme recognition on the DE loop. Overall, this study describes an important biological mechanism involved in enteroviruses biocontrol.",

    "abstract": "Retroviral reverse transcription starts within the capsid and uncoating and reverse transcription are mutually dependent. There is still debate regarding the timing and cellular location of HIVs uncoating and reverse transcription and whether it occurs solely in the cytoplasm, nucleus or both. HIV can infect non-dividing cells because there is active transport of the preintegration complex (PIC) across the nuclear membrane, but Murine Leukemia Virus (MLV) is thought to depend on cell division for replication and whether MLV uncoating and reverse transcription is solely cytoplasmic has not been studied. Here, we used NIH3T3 and primary mouse dendritic cells to determine where the different stages of reverse transcription occur and whether cell division is needed for nuclear entry. Our data strongly suggest that in both NIH3T3 cells and dendritic cells (DCs), the initial step of reverse transcription occurs in the cytoplasm. However, we detected MLV RNA/DNA hybrid intermediates in the nucleus of dividing NIH3T3 cells and non-dividing DCs, suggesting that reverse transcription can continue after nuclear entry. We also found that the MLV PIC requires cell division to enter the nucleus of NIH3T3 cells. In contrast, we show that MLV can infect non-dividing primary DCs, although integration of MLV DNA in DCs still required the viral p12 protein. Knockdown of several nuclear pore proteins dramatically reduced the appearance of integrated MLV DNA in DCs but not NIH3T3 cells. Additionally, MLV capsid associates with the nuclear pore proteins NUP358 and NUP62 during infection. These findings suggest that simple retroviruses, like HIV, gain nuclear entry by traversing the nuclear pore complex in non-mitotic cells.\n\nAuthor SummaryIt is widely believed that gammaretroviruses like MLV require cell division to achieve nuclear entry and complete their replication. We show here that while this is true for rapidly dividing tissue culture cells, in quiescent cells like dendritic cells, the natural targets of MLV infection, the virus establishes infection without cell division. These studies show that the requirements for retrovirus infection depend on the cell type.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria uptake different forms of iron through various channels to meet their needs. Our previous studies have shown that TseF, a type VI secretion system effector for Fe uptake, facilitates the delivery of outer membrane vesicle (OMV)-associated PQS-Fe3+ to bacterial cells by involving the Fe(III) pyochelin receptor FptA and the porin OprF. However, the form in which the PQS-Fe3+ complex enters the periplasm and how it is taken up into the cytoplasm remain unclear. Here, we first demonstrate that the PQS-Fe3+ complex enters the cell directly through FptA or OprF. Next, we find that inner membrane transporters such as FptX, PchHI, and FepBCDG are not only necessary for P. aeruginosa to uptake PQS-Fe3+ and PCH-Fe3+, but also necessary for the virulence of P. aeruginosa toward Galleria mellonella larvae. Furthermore, we suggest that the function of PQS-Fe3+ (but not PQS)-mediated quorum-sensing regulation is dependent on FptX, PchHI, and FepBCDG. Additionally, the findings indicate that, unlike FptX, both FepBCDG and PchHI play no role in the autoregulatory loop involving PchR, but further deletion of fepBCDG and pchHI can reverse the inactive PchR phenotype caused by fptX deletion and reactivate the expression of the PCH pathway genes under iron-limited conditions. Finally, this work detected the interaction between FptX, PchHI, and FepBCDG, indicating that a larger complex could be formed to mediate uptake of PQS-Fe3+ and PCH-Fe3+. These results pave the way for a better understanding of the PQS and PCH iron uptake pathway, and provide future directions to tackle P. aeruginosa infections.\n\nIMPORTANCEIron is a key factor for P. aeruginosa to break through the hosts defense system and successfully infect. To acquire the necessary iron from the host, P. aeruginosa has evolved a number of strategies, the most common being the synthesis, secretion, and uptake of siderophores such as pyoverdine, pyochelin, and the quorum-sensing signaling molecule PQS. However, despite intensive studies of the siderophore uptake pathways of P. aeruginosa, our understanding of how siderophores transport iron across the inner membrane into the cytoplasm is still far from complete. Here, we reveal that PQS and pyochelin in P. aeruginosa share inner membrane transporters such as FptX, PchHI and FepBCDG to mediate iron uptake. Meanwhile, PQS and pyochelin-mediated signaling operates to a large extent via these inner membrane transporters. Our study revealed an interesting phenomenon of shared uptake pathways between PQS and pyochelin, which will lead us to reexamine the role of these two molecules in the iron uptake and virulence of P. aeruginosa.",

DNA fragments of roughly 700 base pairs encoding cytochrome oxidase I (COI) were PCR-amplified from each DNA sample. With 99.6-100% nucleotide identity in the GenBank and BOLD databases, all samples were correctly identified at the species level. The scientific names identified by DNA barcoding were matched with legally acceptable market names using the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Seafood List. Out of the 63 samples examined, 13 samples (20.6%) were mislabeled. Moreover, 24 samples (38.1%) did not use the acceptable market names, indicating that the FDA policy is poorly implemented in seafood industry.

    "abstract": "The sequence-specific RNA-binding protein Pumilio controls development of Drosophila; however, the network of mRNAs that it regulates remains incompletely characterized. In this study, we utilize knockdown and knockout approaches coupled with RNA-Seq to measure the impact of Pumilio on the transcriptome of Drosophila cells. We also used an improved RNA co-immunoprecipitation method to identify Pumilio bound mRNAs in Drosophila embryos. Integration of these datasets with the content of Pumilio binding motifs across the transcriptome revealed novel direct Pumilio target genes involved in neural, muscle, wing, and germ cell development, and cellular proliferation. These genes include components of Wnt, TGF-beta, MAPK/ERK, and Notch signaling pathways, DNA replication, and lipid metabolism. Additionally, we identified the mRNAs regulated by the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex, a key factor in Pumilio-mediated repression, and observed concordant regulation of Pumilio:CCR4-NOT target mRNAs. Computational modeling revealed that Pumilio binding, binding site number, density, and sequence context are important determinants of regulation. Moreover, the content of optimal synonymous codons in target mRNAs exhibits a striking functional relationship to Pumilio and CCR4-NOT regulation, indicating that the inherent translation efficiency and stability of the mRNA modulates their response to these trans-acting regulatory factors. Together, the results of this work provide new insights into the Pumilio regulatory network and mechanisms, and the parameters that influence the efficacy of Pumilio-mediated regulation.",

    "abstract": "Electro-methanogenic microbial communities can produce biogas with high efficiency. Extensive efforts have been made to cultivate these communities in engineered systems. Conventional cultivation strategies can select electrotrophic methanogens but not their electron-donating partners, resulting in communities that are sensitive to perturbations. Herein, we developed an alternating polarity strategy to simultaneously select both microbial populations. In two-chamber bioelectrochemical systems amended with activated carbon, the electrode potential was alternated between +0.8 V and -0.4 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode every three days. After eight alternating cycles, cultivated activated carbon was transferred into new bioreactors, and the enrichment procedure was repeated four times. Cumulative biogas production under alternating polarity increased from 45 L/L/kg-activated carbon after start-up to 125 L/L/kg after the 4th enrichment, significantly higher than that under intermittent cathode (-0.4 V/open circuit), continuous cathode (-0.4 V), and open circuit. The communities cultivated under alternating polarity were electroactive and structurally different from those cultivated under other conditions. One Methanobacterium population and two Geobacter populations were consistently abundant and active in the communities. Their 16S rRNA was upregulated by electrode potentials. Bayesian networks inferred close associations between these populations. The cultivation strategy can enhance biogas production, and the cultivated communities may serve as a model system for elucidating the mechanisms of extracellular electron uptake.\n\nSynopsisAn alternating polarity strategy was developed in this study to cultivate electro-methanogenic microbial communities. The cultivated communities can produce biogas more efficiently and help us understand the ecophysiology of the key microbial populations.",

    "abstract": "Mosquito transmitted viruses are responsible for an increasing burden of human disease. Despite this, little is known about the diversity and ecology of viruses within individual mosquito hosts. Using a meta-transcriptomic approach, we analysed the virome of 2,438 individual mosquitos (79 species), spanning [~]4000 km along latitudes and longitudes in China. From these data we identified 393 core viral species associated with mosquitos, including seven (putative) arbovirus species. We identified potential species and geographic hotspots of viral richness and arbovirus occurrence, and demonstrated that host phylogeny had a strong impact on the composition of individual mosquito viromes. Our data revealed a large number of viruses shared among mosquito species or genera, expanding our knowledge of host specificity of insect-associated viruses. We also detected multiple virus species that were widespread throughout the country, possibly facilitated by long-distance mosquito migrations. Together, our results greatly expand the known mosquito virome, linked the viral diversity at the scale of individual insects to that at a country-wide scale, and offered unique insights into the ecology of viruses of insect vectors.",

    "abstract": "Angelman Syndrome (AS) and Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), two distinct neurodevelopmental disorders, result from loss of expression from imprinted genes in the chromosome 15q11-13 locus most commonly caused by a megabase-scale deletion on either the maternal or paternal allele, respectively. Each occurs at an approximate incidence of 1/15,000 to 1/30,000 live births and has a range of debilitating phenotypes. Patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been valuable tools to understand human-relevant gene regulation at this locus and have contributed to the development of therapeutic approaches for AS. Nonetheless, gaps remain in our understanding of how these deletions contribute to dysregulation and phenotypes of AS and PWS. Variability across cell lines due to donor differences, reprogramming methods, and genetic background make it challenging to fill these gaps in knowledge without substantially increasing the number of cell lines used in the analyses. Isogenic cell lines that differ only by the genetic mutation causing the disease can ease this burden without requiring such a large number of cell lines. Here, we describe the development of isogenic human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines modeling the most common genetic subtypes of AS and PWS. These lines allow for a facile interrogation of allele-specific gene regulation at the chromosome 15q11-q13 locus. Additionally, these lines are an important resource to identify and test targeted therapeutic approaches for patients with AS and PWS.",

However, our ability to interpret and explore their mechanisms of action is hampered by a lack of annotation of functional CREs (fCREs) in neural cell types. Here, through genome-scale CRISPR screens of 22,000 candidate CREs (cCREs) in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) undergoing differentiation to excitatory neurons, we identify 2,847 and 5,540 fCREs essential for iPSC fitness and neuronal differentiation, respectively. These fCREs display dynamic epigenomic features and exhibit increased numbers and genomic spans of chromatin interactions following terminal neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, fCREs essential for neuronal differentiation show significantly greater enrichment of genetic heritability for neurodevelopmental diseases including schizophrenia (SCZ), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) than cCREs. Using high-throughput prime editing screens we experimentally confirm 45 SCZ risk variants that act by affecting the function of fCREs. The extensive and in-depth functional annotation of cCREs in neuronal types therefore provides a crucial resource for interpreting non-coding risk variants of neuropsychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions are central, highly flexible components of regulatory mechanisms in all living cells. Over the years, diverse methods have been developed to map protein-protein interactions. These methods have revealed the organization of protein complexes and networks in numerous cells and conditions. However, these methods are also time consuming, costly and sensitive to various experimental artifacts. To avoid these caveats, we have taken advantage of the AlphaFold-Multimer software, which succeeded in predicting the structure of many protein complexes. We designed a relatively simple algorithm based on assessing the physical proximity of a test protein with other AlphaFold structures. Using this method, named AlphaFold-pairs, we have successfully defined the probability of a protein-protein interaction forming. AlphaFold-pairs was validated using well-defined protein-protein interactions found in the literature and specialized databases. All pairwise interactions forming within the 12-subunit transcription machinery RNA Polymerase II, according to available structures, have been identified. Out of 66 possible interactions (excluding homodimers), 19 specific interactions have been found, and an additional previously unknown interaction has been unveiled. The SARS-CoV-2 surface glycoprotein Spike (or S) was confirmed to interact with high preference with the human ACE2 receptor when compared to other human receptors. Notably, two additional receptors, INSR and FLT4, were found to interact with S. For the first time, we have successfully identified protein-protein interactions that are likely to form within the reassortant Eurasian avian-like (EA) H1N1 swine G4 genotype Influenza A virus, which poses a potential zoonotic threat. Testing G4 proteins against human transcription factors and molecular chaperones (a total of 100 proteins) revealed strong specific interactions between the G4 HA and HSP90B1, the G4 NS and the PAQosome subunit RPAP3, as well as the G4 PA and the POLR2A subunit. We predict that AlphaFold-pairs will revolutionize the study of protein-protein interactions in a large number of healthy and diseased systems in the years to come.",

Parts, such as heterologously expressed genes, draw from shared pools of limited cellular resources and interactions between parts themselves and their host are inevitable. Instead of trying to eliminate or disregard these interactions, we propose to leverage them to promote desirable phenotypes. We recently described CRI-SPA, a method for high-throughput genome-wide gene delivery and screening of host:pathway interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this study, we combine this method with biosensor-based high-throughput screening and high-density colony image analysis to identify lead engineering targets for optimising cis-cis-muconic acid (CCM) production in yeast cell factories. Using the biosensor screen, we phenotype >9,700 genotypes for their interaction with the heterologously expressed CCM biosynthesis pathway, including both gene knock-out and overexpression, and identify novel metabolic targets belonging to sulphur assimilation and methionine synthesis, as well as cellular redox homeostasis, positively impacting CCM biosynthesis by up to 280%.

    "abstract": "Systemic blood coagulation accompanies inflammation during severe infection like sepsis and COVID. Weve previously established a link between pyroptosis, a vital defense mechanism against infection, and coagulopathy. During pyroptosis, the formation of gasdermin-D (GSDMD) pores on the plasma membrane leads to the release of tissue factor (TF)-positive microvesicles (MVs) that are procoagulant. Mice lacking GSDMD release fewer TF MVs. However, the specific mechanisms leading from activation of GSDMD to MV release remain unclear. Plasma membrane rupture (PMR) in pyroptosis was recently reported to be actively mediated by the transmembrane protein Ninjurin-1 (NINJ1). Here we show that NINJ1 promotes procoagulant MV release during pyroptosis. Haploinsuffciency or glycine inhibition of NINJ1 limited the release of procoagulant MVs and inflammatory cytokines and protected against blood coagulation and lethality triggered by bacterial flagellin. Our findings suggest a crucial role for NINJ1-dependent PMR in inflammasome-induced blood coagulation and inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium sporozoites are the infective forms of the malaria parasite in the vertebrate host. Gliding motility allows sporozoites to migrate and invade the salivary gland and hepatocytes. Invasion is powered by an actin-myosin motor complex linked to glideosome. However, the gliding complex and the role of several glideosome-associated proteins (GAPs) are poorly understood. In silico analysis of a novel protein, S14, which is uniquely upregulated in salivary gland sporozoites, suggested its association with glideosome-associated proteins. We confirmed S14 expression in sporozoites using real-time PCR. Further, the S14 gene was endogenously tagged with 3XHA-mCherry to study expression and localization. We found its expression and localization on the inner membrane of sporozoites. By targeted gene deletion, we demonstrate that S14 is essential for sporozoite gliding motility, salivary gland, and hepatocyte invasion. The gliding and invasion-deficient S14 KO sporozoites showed normal expression and organization of IMC and surface proteins. Using in silico and the yeast two-hybrid system, we showed the interaction of S14 with the glideosome-associated proteins GAP45 and MTIP. Together, our data show that S14 is a glideosome-associated protein and plays an essential role in sporozoite gliding motility, which is critical for the invasion of the salivary gland, hepatocyte, and malaria transmission.",

Human ALI cultures supported robust growth and complete development of C. hominis in vitro including all life cycle stages. C. hominis infection induced a strong interferon response from enterocytes, likely driven by an endogenous dsRNA virus in the parasite. Prior infection with Cryptosporidium induced type III IFN secretion and consequently blunted infection with Rotavirus, including live attenuated vaccine strains.

Many heart muscle diseases are caused by mutations in genes that encode contractile proteins, including cardiac actin mutations. Zebrafish are an advantageous system for modelling cardiac diseases due to their ability to develop without a functional heart throughout embryonic development. However, genome duplication in the teleost lineage poses a unique challenge by increasing the number of genes involved in heart development. Four actin genes are expressed in the zebrafish heart: acta1b, actc2, and duplicates of actc1a on chromosomes 19 and 20. In this study, we characterize the actin genes involved in early zebrafish heart development using in situ hybridization and CRISPR targeting to determine the most suitable gene for modelling actin changes observed in human patients with heart disease. The actc1a and acta1b genes are predominantly expressed during embryonic heart development, resulting in severe cardiac phenotypes when targeted with CRISPR. Considering the duplication of the actc1a gene, we recommend acta1b as the best gene for targeted cardiac actin research.",

    "abstract": "Target-mediated miRNA degradation (TDMD) is a recently discovered process of post-transcriptional regulation of miRNA stability in animals. TDMD is induced by the formation of the non-canonical duplex of Ago-bound miRNAs with the specialized RNA target, and, as suggested for human cell culture, this complex is recognized by the ZSWIM8 receptor protein of the Cullin-RING-ligase complex CRL3. CRL3 ubiquitinates Ago, resulting in proteolysis of Ago and degradation of the released miRNAs. To date, the molecular mechanism of the TDMD process was not studied in other animal species. Here we investigated protein Dora, the Drosophila ortholog of ZSWIM8, in the culture of Drosophila ovarian somatic cells (OSC). We show that Dora in OSCs localizes in protein granules that are not related to P-and GW-bodies. The knock-out of Dora up-regulates multiple miRNAs, including miR-7-5p. Also, we show that Dora associates with proteins of the CRL3 complex, and the depletion of its main component Cul3 up-regulates miR-7-5p. We concluded that the mechanism of TDMD is conserved in humans and Drosophila. The knock-out of Dora also down-regulates the putative protein-coding targets of miRNAs. One of them is Tom from the Brd-C gene family, which is known to repress the Notch signaling pathway. Indeed, in cells lacking Dora, we have observed the down-regulation of cut, the marker of the activated Notch pathway. This data indicates that TDMD in OSCs may contribute to modulation of the Notch pathway.",

However, the functional importance of human silencers needs to be elucidated, such as whether they can form \"super-silencers\" and whether they are linked to cancer progression. Here, through interrogating two putative silencer components of FGF18 gene, we found that two nearby silencers can cooperate via compensatory chromatin interactions to form a \"super-silencer\". Furthermore, double knockout of two silencers exhibited synergistic upregulation of FGF18 expression and changes of cell identity. To perturb the \"super-silencers\", we applied combinational treatment of an EZH2 inhibitor GSK343, and a REST inhibitor, X5050 (\"GR\"). We found that GR led to severe loss of TADs and loops, while the use of one inhibitor by itself only showed mild changes. Such changes in TADs and loops were associated with reduced CTCF and TOP2A mRNA levels. Moreover, GSK343 and X5050 synergistically upregulated super-silencer-controlled genes related to cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA damage, leading to anticancer effects both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our data demonstrated the first example of a \"super-silencer\" and showed that combinational usage of GSK343 and X5050 to disrupt \"super-silencers\" could potentially lead to cancer ablation.",

Our results indicate that the loading of MukBEF occurs preferentially in newly replicated DNA, at multiple loci on the chromosome where it can promote long-range contacts in cis even though MukBEF can promote long-range contacts in the absence of replication. Using HiC and ChIP-seq analyses in strains with rearranged chromosomes, the prevention of MukBEF activity increases with the number of matS sites and this effect likely results from the unloading of MukBEF by MatP.

    "abstract": "Riboflavin (vitamin B2) is the precursor of the flavin coenzymes, FAD and FMN, which play a central role in cellular redox metabolism. While humans must obtain riboflavin from dietary sources, certain microbes, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), can biosynthesize riboflavin de novo. Riboflavin precursors have also been implicated in the activation of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells which recognize microbial metabolites derived from the riboflavin biosynthesis pathway complexed to the MHC-I-like molecule, MR1. To investigate the biosynthesis and function of riboflavin and its pathway intermediates in mycobacterial metabolism, physiology and MAIT cell recognition, we constructed conditional knockdowns (hypomorphs) in riboflavin biosynthesis and utilization genes in Mycobacterium smegmatis (Msm) and Mtb by inducible CRISPR interference and analyzed the impact of gene silencing on viability, and on the levels of expression of riboflavin pathway genes, and also on the levels of the pathway proteins as well as riboflavin in Msm. Despite lacking a canonical transporter, we showed that both organisms can import and assimilate exogenous riboflavin when supplied at high concentration. We demonstrated functional redundancy in lumazine synthase activity in Msm and found that silencing of ribA2 or ribF was profoundly bactericidal in Mtb. In Msm, ribA2 silencing resulted in concomitant knockdown of other pathway genes coupled with RibA2 and riboflavin depletion and was also bactericidal. In addition to their use in genetic validation of potential drug targets for tuberculosis, the collection of hypomorphs provides a useful resource for investigating the role of pathway intermediates in MAIT cell recognition of mycobacteria.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe pathway for biosynthesis and utilization of riboflavin, the precursor of the essential coenzymes, FMN and FAD, is of particular interest in the flavin-rich pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), for two important reasons: (i) the pathway includes potential TB drug targets; and (ii) metabolites derived from the riboflavin biosynthesis pathway provide ligands for mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, which have been implicated in TB pathogenesis. However, the riboflavin pathway is poorly understood in mycobacteria, which lack canonical mechanisms to transport this vitamin and to regulate flavin coenzyme homeostasis. By assessing the impact of conditionally disrupting each step of the pathway on mycobacterial viability and on the levels of the pathway proteins as well as riboflavin, we genetically validate the riboflavin pathway as a target for TB drug discovery and provide a resource for further exploring the association between riboflavin biosynthesis, MAIT cell activation and TB infection and disease.",

    "abstract": "Alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells maintain lung health by acting as stem cells and producing pulmonary surfactant. AT2 dysfunction underlies many lung diseases including interstitial lung disease (ILD), in which some inherited forms result from mislocalisation of surfactant protein C (SFTPC) variants. Disease modelling and dissection of mechanisms remains challenging due to complexities in deriving and maintaining AT2 cells ex vivo. Here, we describe the development of expandable adult AT2-like organoids derived from human fetal lung which are phenotypically stable, can differentiate into AT1-like cells and are genetically manipulable. We use these organoids to test key effectors of SFTPC maturation identified in a forward genetic screen including the E3 ligase ITCH, demonstrating that their depletion phenocopies the pathological SFTPC redistribution seen for the SFTPC-I73T variant. In summary, we demonstrate the development of a novel alveolar organoid model and use it to identify effectors of SFTPC maturation necessary for AT2 health.",

    "abstract": "The fluorinated thymidine analogue trifluridine (FTD) is a chemotherapeutic drug commonly used to treat cancer; however, the mechanism by which FTD induces cytotoxicity is not fully understood. In addition, the effect of gain-of-function (GOF) missense mutations of the TP53 gene (encoding p53), which promote cancer progression and chemotherapeutic drug resistance, on the chemotherapeutic efficacy of FTD is unclear. Here, we revealed the mechanisms by which FTD induced aberrant mitosis and contributed to cytotoxicity in both p53-null and p53-GOF missense mutant cells. In p53-null mutant cells, FTD induced DNA double-stranded breaks, single-stranded DNA accumulation, and the associated DNA damage repair responses during G2 phase. Nevertheless, FTD-induced DNA damage and the related responses were not sufficient to trigger strict G2/M checkpoint arrest. Thus, these features were carried over into mitosis, resulting in chromosome breaks and bridges, and subsequent cytokinesis failure. Improper mitotic exit eventually led to cell apoptosis, caused by the accumulation of extensive DNA damage and the presence of micronuclei encapsulated in the disrupted nuclear envelope. Upon FTD treatment, the behavior of the p53-GOF-missense-mutant, isogenic cell lines, generated by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, was similar to that of p53-null mutant cells. Thus, our data suggest that FTD treatment overrode the effect on gene expression induced by p53-GOF mutants and exerted its anti-tumor activity in a manner that was independent of p53 function.",

    "abstract": "Signal amplification based on the mechanism of hybridization chain reaction (HCR) provides a unified framework for multiplex, quantitative, high-resolution imaging of RNA and protein targets in highly autofluorescent samples. With conventional bandpass imaging, multiplexing is typically limited to four or five targets due to the difficulty in separating signals generated by fluorophores with overlapping spectra. Spectral imaging has offered the conceptual promise of higher levels of multiplexing, but it has been challenging to realize this potential in highly autofluorescent samples including whole-mount vertebrate embryos. Here, we demonstrate robust HCR spectral imaging with linear unmixing, enabling simultaneous imaging of 10 RNA and/or protein targets in whole-mount zebrafish embryos and mouse brain sections. Further, we demonstrate that the amplified and unmixed signal in each of 10 channels is quantitative, enabling accurate and precise relative quantitation of RNA and/or protein targets with subcellular resolution, and RNA absolute quantitation with single-molecule resolution, in the anatomical context of highly autofluorescent samples.\n\nSUMMARYSpectral imaging with signal amplification based on the mechanism of hybridization chain reaction enables robust 10-plex, quantitative, high-resolution imaging of RNA and protein targets in whole-mount vertebrate embryos and brain sections.",

    "abstract": "Convergent extension (CE) is a fundamental morphogenetic process where oriented cell behaviors lead to polarized extension of diverse tissues. In vertebrates, regulation of CE requires both non-canonical Wnt, its co-receptor Ror, and \"core members\" of the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway. PCP was originally identified as a mechanism to coordinate the cellular polarity in the plane of static epithelium, where core proteins Frizzled (Fz)/ Dishevelled (Dvl) and Van Gogh-like (Vangl)/ Prickel (Pk) partition to opposing cell cortex. But how core PCP proteins interact with each other to mediate non-canonical Wnt/ Ror signaling during CE is not clear. We found previously that during CE, Vangl cell-autonomously recruits Dvl to the plasma membrane but simultaneously keeps Dvl inactive. In this study, we show that non-canonical Wnt induces Dvl to transition from Vangl to Fz. PK inhibits the transition, and functionally synergize with Vangl to suppress Dvl during CE. Conversely, Ror is required for the transition, and functionally antagonizes Vangl. Biochemically, Vangl interacts directly with both Ror and Dvl. Ror and Dvl do not bind directly, but can be cofractionated with Vangl. We propose that Pk assists Vangl to function as an unconventional adaptor that brings Dvl and Ror into a complex to serves two functions: 1) simultaneously preventing both Dvl and Ror from ectopically activating non-canonical Wnt signaling; and 2) relaying Dvl to Fz for signaling activation upon non-canonical Wnt induced dimerization of Fz and Ror.",
