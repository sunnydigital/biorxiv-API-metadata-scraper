    "abstract": "Synchrony of oscillatory brain activity has been postulated to be a binding mechanism for cognitive and motor functions. Spectral analysis of human electrocorticogram (ECoG) in sensorimotor cortex has shown that power density of gamma band activity (30-60 Hz) increased and that of alpha-beta band activity (10-20 Hz) decreased during performance of manipulative visuomotor tasks, indicating that amplitude modulation of the gamma band activity occurred in relation to the task performance. Amplitude modulation may provide evidence for synchrony of local neuronal assembly. However, it does not implement the binding mechanisms for distributed networks that are necessary for cognitive and motor functions. To prove that oscillatory activity mediates a binding mechanism, phase modulation of oscillatory activity in a wide range area should be shown. We performed coherence analysis of the ECoG signals in sensorimotor cortex to study if synchrony of the gamma band activity between these areas occurs in relation to manipulative task performance. The ECoGs were recorded from 14 sites in sensorimotor cortex including hand-arm areas with subdural grid electrodes in four subjects. Coherence estimates in all pair-wise sites were calculated in different frequency bands with 10 Hz widths from 10 to 80 Hz. In all subjects, coherence estimates increased in the lower gamma band (20-50 Hz) during the performance of the manipulative tasks. But coherence in the alpha-beta band (10-20 Hz) also increased even though amplitude modulation did not occur in this frequency band. Coherence estimates increased in site pairs within and between sensory and motor areas, many separated by intervening sites. This interregional synchrony of the alpha-beta and the lower gamma activities may play a role in integration of sensorimotor information. Task-dependent increases in coherence estimates, i.e., greater increases during performance of the manipulative tasks than during the simple tasks, suggest another role of synchrony in attention mechanism. Time-series coherence analysis showed that phase modulation occurred in different timings for activities in the alpha-beta and the lower gamma bands. For the activity in higher gamma band (50-80 Hz), power density increased but coherence estimates decreased. Thus, only amplitude modulation occurred in this frequency band. Altogether these results suggest that oscillatory activities in different frequency bands may reflect different functional roles by modulating neural activity in different ways.",

    "abstract": "Addiction to psychoactive substances is a maladaptive learned behavior. Contexts surrounding drug use integrate this aberrant mnemonic process and hold strong relapse triggering ability. Here we asked where context and salience might be concurrently represented in the brain, and found circuitry hubs specific to morphine-related contextual information storage.\n\nStarting with a classical rodent morphine-conditioned place preference (CPP) apparatus, we developed a CPP protocol that allows stimuli presentation inside a magnetic resonance imaging scanner, to allow the investigation of whole brain activity during retrieval of drug-context paired associations, as well as resting state functional connectivity under the effect of morphine conditioning. Using fMRI we found context-specific responses to stimulus onset in multiple brain regions, namely limbic, sensory, and striatal. Furthermore, we found increased functional connectivity of lateral septum with regions within and beyond a proposed limbic network, and of the lateral habenula with hippocampal CA1 region, in response to repeated pairings of drug and context.\n\nSubsequent exposure to either morphine or saline-conditioned contexts led to significant, context-specific, functional interconnectivity among amygdala, lateral habenula, and lateral septum. Resting-state connectivity of the lateral habenula and amygdala, and that during saline-paired context presentation significantly predicted inter-individual CPP score differences.\n\nIn sum, our findings show that drug- and saline-paired contexts form distinct memory traces in overlapping functional brain microcircuits, and intrinsic connectivity of habenula, septum, and amygdala likely influences the maladaptive contextual learning in response to opioids. We identify functional mechanisms involved in the acquisition and retrieval of drug-related memories that might be behind the relapse-triggering ability of opioid-associated sensory/contextual cues.\n\nIn briefTo investigate the brain-wide regional activity underlying drug addiction Gomes-Ribeiro et al. have developed a rodent morphine-induced CPP (conditioned place preference) protocol whose contextual cues can be consistently presented inside an MRI apparatus. The authors found a common circuitry supporting the neural mechanisms responsible for memorizing an association between distinct contexts, and morphine or the absence thereof, that includes regions involved in affect, reward, contextual perception and memory, with subtle, intriguing, functional specificities ultimately underlying the storage of distinct, individual, CPP memory engrams across the different animals. Animals that are more prone to strong emotional responses (as measured by the baseline resting state amygdala and habenula functional connectivity), exhibit a kind of neural circuit priming effect, and thus develop stronger connectivity patterns in anticipation of stronger morphine addiction behavior. These findings could help to clarify the inter-individual sensitivity to opioids in humans, since despite responding positively to the effects of opioids, many humans do not develop an addiction.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=139 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/552221v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8567faorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6d7e91org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9065e9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12cb44_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Ephaptic coupling is a unique way physically adjacent neurons can influence one anothers activity that, without an underlying molecular mechanism, could easily be considered a form of electrical interference rather than a genuine contributor to information processing. Here, we show the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel unilateralizes the ephaptic inhibition of Drosophila gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs). HCN in sweet-sensing GRNs (sGRNs) allows sweetness to dominate bitterness. Simultaneously, HCN, throttling sGRNs in sugar-rich environments, enhances bitter-sensing GRN sensitivity to allow for uncompromised aversion to potentially toxic bitter substances. Thus, ephaptic inhibition can be genetically programmed and subjected to natural selection. This implies ephaptic coding arose to meet a physiologic need and may provide mechanistic insights into the well-known but enigmatic phenomenon of sweet-dependent taste suppression in humans.",

    "abstract": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a powerful system for the expression of genome-wide or combinatorial libraries for diverse types of screening. However, expressing large libraries in yeast requires high-efficiency transformation and controlled expression. Transformation of yeast using electroporation methods is more efficient than chemical methods; however, protocols described for electroporation require large amounts of linearized plasmid DNA and often yield about 106 cfu/{micro}g of plasmid DNA. We optimized the electroporation of yeast cells for the expression of whole-genome libraries to yield up to 108 cfu/{micro}g plasmid DNA. The protocol generates sufficient transformants for 10-100x coverage of diverse genome libraries with small amounts of genomic libraries (0.1{micro}g of DNA per reaction) and provides guidance on calculations to estimate library size coverage and transformation efficiency. It describes the preparation of electrocompetent yeast cells with lithium acetate and dithiothreitol conditioning step and the transformation of cells by electroporation with carrier DNA. We validated the protocol using three yeast surface display libraries and demonstrated using nanopore sequencing that libraries size and diversity are preserved. Moreover, expression analysis confirmed library functionality and the methods efficacy. Hence, this protocol yields a sufficient representation of the genome of interest for downstream screening purposes while limiting the amount of the genomic library required.",

    "abstract": "The ever decreasing cost of sequencing and the multiplication of potential applications for the study of metagenomes have led to an unprecedented increase in the volume of data generated. One of the most prevalent applications of metagenomics is the study of microbial environments, such as the human gut. The gut microbiome has been shown to play an important role in human health, providing critical information for patient diagnosis and prognosis. However, the analysis of metagenomic data remains challenging for many reasons, including reference catalogs, sparsity and compositionality of the data, to name a few. Deep learning (DL) enables novel and promising approaches that complement state-of-the-art microbiome pipelines. In fact, DL-based methods can address almost all aspects of microbiome analysis, including novel pathogen detection, sequence classification, patient stratification, and disease prediction. Beyond the generation of predictive models, a key aspect of such methods remains their interpretability. In this article, we provide a systematic review of deep learning approaches in metagenomics, whether based on convolutional networks, autoencoders, or attention-based models. These methods aggregate contextualized data and pave the way for improved patient care and a better understanding of the key role the microbiome plays in our health.",

We demonstrated that ablation of Zdhhc9 in mice substantially impairs the maturation of oligodendrocytes, resulting in fewer mature, myelinating oligodendrocytes, higher numbers of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and a decrease in the density of myelinated axons. Ultrastructural analysis of the remaining myelinated axons in the corpus callosum revealed further disruptions in myelin integrity. RNA sequencing and proteomic analyses revealed a concomitant decrease in the expression of genes and proteins involved in lipid metabolism, cholesterol synthesis and myelin compaction. These results reveal a previously underappreciated and fundamental role for ZDHHC9 and protein palmitoylation in regulating oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelinogenesis and provide mechanistic insights into the deficits observed in white matter volume in patients with mutations in ZDHHC9.",

    "abstract": "Purifying selection is the most pervasive type of selection, as it constantly removes deleterious mutations arising in populations, directly scaling with population size. Highly expressed genes appear to accumulate fewer deleterious mutations between divergent species lineages, pointing towards gene expression as an additional driver of purifying selection. However, estimates of the effect of gene expression on segregating deleterious variants in natural populations are lacking, as well as an understanding of the relative contribution of population size and gene expression to overall purifying selection pressure. Here, we analyse genomic and transcriptomic data from two natural populations of closely related sister species with different demographic histories, the Emperor (Aptenodytes forsteri) and the King penguins (A. patagonicus), and demonstrate that purifying selection at the population-level depends on the level of gene expression, with larger effects than population size. Deleterious segregating variants spread less in the population when they are in genes with higher expression rate. Leveraging realistic forward simulations, we estimate that the top 10% of the most highly expressed genes in a genome experience a selection pressure corresponding to an average selection coefficient of -0.1, which decreases to a selection coefficient of -0.01 for the top 50%. Gene expression appears to be a fundamental driver of purifying selection in natural populations, also effective at small population size. We suggest gene expression could be used as a proxy for gene selection coefficients (i.e., distribution of fitness effects), which are notoriously difficult to derive in non-model species under real-world conditions.",

    "abstract": "One key limitation in developing effective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases is the lack of models that accurately mimic the complex physiopathology of the human disease. Humans accumulate with age the pigment neuromelanin inside catecholaminergic neurons. Neurons reaching the highest neuromelanin levels preferentially degenerate in Parkinsons, Alzheimers and apparently healthy aging individuals. However, this brain pigment is not taken into consideration in current animal models because, in contrast to humans, common laboratory species such as rodents do not produce neuromelanin. Here we generated a tissue-specific transgenic mouse that mimics the human age-dependent brain-wide distribution of neuromelanin within catecholaminergic regions, based on the constitutive catecholamine-specific expression of human melanin-producing enzyme tyrosinase. In parallel to progressive human-like neuromelanin pigmentation, these animals display age-related neuronal dysfunction and degeneration affecting numerous brain circuits and body tissues, linked to motor and non-motor deficits, reminiscent of early neurodegenerative stages. This model may open new research avenues in the field of brain aging and neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "As of July 2023, EG.5.1 (a.k.a. XBB.1.9.2.5.1), a XBB subvariant bearing the S:Q52H and S:F456L substitutions, alongside the S:F486P substitution (Figure S1A), has rapidly spread in some countries. On July 19, 2023, the WHO classified EG.5 as a variant under monitoring. First, we showed that EG.5.1 exhibits a higher effective reproduction number compared with XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, and its parental lineage (XBB.1.9.2), suggesting that EG.5.1 will spread globally and outcompete these XBB subvariants in the near future. We then addressed whether EG.5.1 evades from the antiviral effect of the humoral immunity induced by breakthrough infection (BTI) of XBB subvariants and performed a neutralization assay using XBB BTI sera. However, the 50% neutralization titer (NT50) of XBB BTI sera against EG.5.1 was comparable to those against XBB.1.5/1.9.2 and XBB.1.16. Moreover, the sensitivity of EG.5.1 to convalescent sera of XBB.1- and XBB.1.5-infected hamsters was similar to those of XBB.1.5/1.9 and XBB.1.16. These results suggest that the increased Re of EG.5.1 is attributed to neither increased infectivity nor immune evasion from XBB BTI, and the emergence and spread of EG.5 is driven by the other pressures. We previously demonstrated that Omicron BTI cannot efficiently induce antiviral humoral immunity against the variant infected. In fact, the NT50s of the BTI sera of Omicron BA.1, BA.2, and BA.5 against the variant infected were 3.0-, 2.2-, and 3.4-fold lower than that against the ancestral B.1.1 variant, respectively. However, strikingly, we found that the NT50 of the BTI sera of XBB1.5/1.9 and XBB.1.16 against the variant infected were 8.7- and 8.3-fold lower than that against the B.1.1 variant. These results suggest that XBB BTI cannot efficiently induce antiviral humoral immunity against XBB subvariants.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=147 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/552415v1_figs1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (39K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f95376org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d66fa8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3c8841org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15824c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure S1.C_FLOATNO Virological features of EG.5.1 and XBB BTI (A) Frequency of mutations of interest in the representative XBB sublineages.

    "abstract": "Despite a relatively low mutation rate, the large number of SARS-CoV-2 infections has allowed for substantial genetic change, leading to a multitude of emerging variants. Using a recently determined mutation rate (per site replication), as well as parameter estimates for within-host SARS-CoV-2 infection, we apply a stochastic transmission-bottleneck model to describe the survival probability of de novo SARS-CoV-2 mutations. For narrow bottlenecks, we find mutations affecting pertarget-cell attachment rate (with phenotypes associated with fusogenicity and ACE2 binding), have similar transmission probabilities to mutations affecting viral load clearance (with phenotypes associated with humoral evasion). We further find that mutations affecting the eclipse rate (with phenotypes associated with reorganization of cellular metabolic processes and synthesis of viral budding precursor material) are highly favoured relative to all other traits examined. We find mutations leading to reduced removal rates of infected cells (with phenotypes associated with innate immune evasion) have limited transmission advantage relative to mutations leading to humoral evasion. Predicted transmission probabilities, however, for mutations affecting innate immune evasion are more consistent with the range of clinically-estimated household transmission probabilities for de novo mutations. This result suggests that although mutations affecting humoral evasion are more easily transmitted when they occur, mutations affecting innate immune evasion may occur more readily. We examine our predictions in the context of a number of previously characterized mutations in circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2. Our work offers both a null model for SARS-CoV-2 substitution rates and predicts which aspects of viral life history are most likely to successfully evolve, despite low mutation rates and repeated transmission bottlenecks.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with greater transmissibility or immune evasion properties has jeopardized the existing vaccine and antibody-based countermeasures. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of boosting with the protein nanoparticle NVX-CoV2373 or NVX-CoV2540 vaccines containing ancestral or BA.5 S proteins, respectively, in mRNA-immunized pre-immune hamsters, against challenge with the Omicron BA.5 variant of SARS-CoV-2. Serum antibody binding and neutralization titers were quantified before challenge, and viral loads were measured 3 days after challenge. Compared to an mRNA vaccine boost, NVX-CoV2373 or NVX-CoV2540 induced higher serum antibody binding responses against ancestral Wuhan-1 or BA.5 spike proteins, and greater neutralization of Omicron BA.1 and BA.5 variants. One and three months after vaccine boosting, hamsters were challenged with the Omicron BA.5 variant. NVX-CoV2373 and NVX-CoV2540 boosted hamsters showed reduced viral infection in the nasal washes, nasal turbinates, and lungs compared to unvaccinated animals. Also, NVX-CoV2540 BA.5 boosted animals had fewer breakthrough infections than NVX-CoV2373 or mRNA-vaccinated hamsters. Thus, immunity induced by NVX-CoV2373 or NVX-CoV2540 boosting can protect against the Omicron BA.5 variant in the Syrian hamster model.\n\nIMPORTANCEAs SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emergence, the efficacy of prior and updated COVID-19 vaccines need to be tested. Here, we tested the efficacy of two nanoparticle protein-based vaccines in pre-immune hamsters against a challenge with the BA.5 Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. Compared to an mRNA vaccine boost, the nanoparticle vaccine NVX-CoV2373 and NVX-CoV2540 induced higher serum antibody binding and neutralization responses against ancestral Wuhan-1 or BA.5 variants. One and three months after the last immunization, hamsters were challenged with the Omicron BA.5 variant. NVX-CoV2373 and NVX-CoV2540 boosted hamsters showed reduced viral infection in the nasal washes, nasal turbinates, and lungs compared to unvaccinated animals. Animals that received the homologous vaccine, NVX-CoV2540, had fewer breakthrough infections than NVX-CoV2373 or mRNA-vaccinated hamsters. Together, our data shows that the BA.5 nanoparticle vaccine is effective and that it is important to update the COVID-19 vaccine to match currently circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "The frequency of left-handedness in humans is [~]10% worldwide and slightly higher in males than females. Twin and family studies estimate the heritability of human handedness at around 25%. The low but substantial frequency of left-handedness has been suggested to imply negative frequency-dependent selection, e.g. owing to a \"surprise\" advantage of left-handers in combat against opponents more used to fighting right-handers. Because such game-theoretic hypotheses involve social interaction, here, we perform an analysis of the evolution of handedness based on kin-selection, which is understood to play a major role in the evolution of social behaviour generally. We show that: (1) relatedness modulates the balance of right-handedness versus left-handedness, according to whether left- handedness is marginally selfish versus marginally altruistic; (2) sex differences in relatedness to social partners may drive sex differences in handedness; (3) differential relatedness of parents and offspring may generate parent-offspring conflict and sexual conflict leading to the evolution of maternal and paternal genetic effects in relation to handedness; and (4) differential relatedness of maternal-origin versus paternal-origin genes may generate intragenomic conflict leading to the evolution of parent-of-origin-specific gene effects--such as \"genomic imprinting\"--and associated maladaptation.",

    "abstract": "Alterations in the tumor suppressor ATRX are recurrently observed in several cancer types including sarcomas, which are mesenchymal neoplasms. ATRX has multiple epigenetic functions including heterochromatin formation and maintenance and regulation of transcription through modulation of chromatin accessibility. Here, we show in murine mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) that Atrx deficiency aberrantly activated mesenchymal differentiation programs. This includes adipogenic pathways where ATRX loss induced expression of adipogenic transcription factors (Ppar{gamma} and Cebp) and enhanced adipogenic differentiation in response to differentiation stimuli. These changes are linked to loss of heterochromatin near mesenchymal lineage genes together with increased chromatin accessibility and gains of active chromatin marks at putative enhancer elements and promoters. Finally, we observed depletion of H3K9me3 at transposable elements, which are derepressed including near mesenchymal genes where they could serve as regulatory elements. Our results demonstrate that ATRX functions to buffer against differentiation in mesenchymal progenitor cells, which has implications for understanding ATRX loss of function in sarcomas.",

    "abstract": "The SET binding protein 1 (SETBP1) gene encodes a transcription factor (TF) involved in various cellular processes. Distinct SETBP1 variants have been linked to three different diseases. Germline variants cause the ultra-rare pediatric Schinzel Giedion Syndrome (SGS) and SETBP1 haploinsufficiency disorder (SETBP1-HD), characterized by severe multisystemic abnormalities with neurodegeneration or a less severe brain phenotype accompanied by hypotonia and strabismus, respectively. Somatic variants in SETBP1 are associated with hematological malignancies and cancer development in other tissues in adults. To better understand the tissue-specific mechanisms involving SETBP1, we analyzed publicly available RNA-sequencing data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. We found SETBP1 and its known target genes were widely expressed across 31 adult human tissues. Hierarchical clustering identified 3 distinct expression patterns of SETBP1 targets across tissues. Functional enrichment analysis revealed gene sets related to transcription regulation, DNA binding, and mitochondrial function. TF activity analysis of SETBP1 and its target TFs revealed tissue-specific TF activity, underscoring the role of tissue context-driven regulation and suggesting its impact in SETBP1-associated disease. In addition to uncovering tissue-specific molecular signatures of SETBP1 expression and TF activity, we provide a Shiny web application to facilitate the exploration of TF activity across human tissues for 758 TFs.",

    "abstract": "MotivationGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) in large biobanks are transforming genetic research and enable the detection of novel genotype-phenotype relationships. In the last two decades, over 60,000 genetic associations across thousands of human diseases and traits have been discovered using a GWAS approach. Due to denser genotyping and increasing sample sizes, researchers are increasingly faced with computational challenges when executing GWAS analysis. A reproducible, modular and extensible pipeline with a focus on parallelization is essential to simplify data analysis and to allow researchers to devote their time to other essential tasks such as result interpretation and downstream analysis.\n\nResultsHere we present nf-gwas, a Nextflow pipeline to run biobank-scale GWAS analysis. The pipeline automatically performs numerous pre- and post-processing steps, integrates regression modeling from the REGENIE package and currently supports single-variant, gene-based and interaction testing. nf-gwas also includes an extensive reporting functionality that allows to inspect thousands of phenotypes and navigate interactive Manhattan plots directly in the web browser. The pipeline is extensively tested using the unit-style testing framework nf-test to ensure code maintainability, a crucial requirement in clinical and pharmaceutical settings. Furthermore, we validated the pipeline against published GWAS datasets and benchmarked the pipeline on high-performance computing and cloud infrastructures to provide cost estimations to end users.\n\nAvailabilitynf-gwas is free available at https://github.com/genepi/nf-gwas.\n\nContactlukas.forer@i-med.ac.at",

    "abstract": "The molecular basis for cortical expansion during evolution remains largely unknown. Here, we found that FGF-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling promotes the self-renewal and expansion of cortical radial glial (RG) cells.\n\nFurthermore, FGF-ERK signaling induces Bmp7 expression in cortical RG cells, which increases the length of the neurogenic period. We demonstrate that ERK signaling and SHH signaling mutually inhibit each other in cortical RG cells. We also provide evidence that ERK signaling is elevated in cortical RG cells during development and evolution. We conclude that the evolutionary expansion of the mammalian cortex, notably in human, is driven by ERK-BMP7-GLI3R signaling pathway in cortical RG cells, which participates in a positive feedback loop through antagonizing SHH signaling. We also propose that the molecular basis for cortical evolutionary dwarfism, exemplified by the lissencephalic mouse which originated from a larger and gyrencephalic ancestor, is due to mouse cortical RG cells receiving higher SHH signaling that antagonizes ERK signaling.",

    "abstract": "Following acute retinal damage, zebrafish possess the ability to regenerate all neuronal subtypes. This regeneration requires Muller glia (MG) to reprogram and divide asymmetrically to produce a multipotent Muller glia-derived neuronal progenitor cell (MGPC). This raises three key questions. First, does loss of different retinal cell subtypes induce unique MG regeneration responses? Second, do MG reprogram to a developmental retinal progenitor cell state? And finally, to what extent does regeneration recapitulate retinal development? We examined these questions by performing single-nuclear and single-cell RNA-Seq and ATAC-Seq in both developing and regenerating retinas. While MG reprogram to a state similar to late-stage retinal progenitors in developing retinas, there are transcriptional differences between reprogrammed MG/MGPCs and late progenitors, as well as reprogrammed MG in outer and inner retinal damage models. Validation of candidate genes confirmed that loss of different subtypes induces differences in transcription factor gene expression and regeneration outcomes. This work identifies major differences between gene regulatory networks activated following the selective loss of different subtypes of retina neurons, as well as between retinal regeneration and development.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia is marked by poor social functioning that can have a severe impact on quality of life and independence, but the underlying neural circuity is not well understood. Here we used a translational model of subanesthetic ketamine mice to delineate neural pathways in the brain linked to social deficits in schizophrenia. Mice treated with chronic ketamine exhibit profound social and sensorimotor deficits as previously reported. Using three-dimensional c-Fos immunolabeling and volume imaging (iDISCO), we show that ketamine treatment resulted in hypoactivation of the lateral septum (LS) in response to social stimuli. Chemogenetic activation of the LS rescued social deficits after ketamine treatment, while chemogenetic inhibition of previously active populations in the LS (i.e. social engram neurons) recapitulated social deficits in ketamine-naive mice. We then examined the translatome of LS engram neurons and found that ketamine treatment dysregulated genes implicated in neuronal excitability and apoptosis, which may contribute to LS hypoactivation. A number of ketamine-induced differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including those involved in mitochondrial function and neuroinflammatory pathways, were shared with human schizophrenia and mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders. Chemogenetic activation of LS engram neurons induced downstream activity in the ventral part of the basolateral amygdala, subparafascicular nucleus of the thalamus, intercalated amygdalar nucleus, olfactory areas, and dentate gyrus, and may also reduce connectivity of the LS with the piriform cortex and caudate-putamen. In sum, schizophrenia-like social deficits may emerge via changes in the intrinsic excitability of a discrete subpopulation of LS neurons that serve as a central hub to coordinate social behavior via downstream projections to reward, fear extinction, motor and sensory processing regions of the brain.",

Here we recorded neural activity in a primary auditory cortical area, Field L, in zebra finches practicing singing alone and directing courtship songs to females. We first discovered that many Field L neurons changed their singing-related discharge patterns during courtship singing, even though the auditory feedback from the birds own song was similar. We next used syllable-targeted distorted auditory feedback (DAF) to test how auditory error signals depend on courtship context. Though past work showed that dopamine neurons uniformly reduce error signaling during courtship, Field L neurons exhibited heterogeneous error signal re-tuning in the presence of the female. Thus, single neurons in a primary sensory area process feedback from self-produced actions differently during practice and performance.",
