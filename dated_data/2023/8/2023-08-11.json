    "abstract": "When humans begin learning new motor skills, they typically display early rapid performance improvements. It is not well understood how knowledge acquired during this early skill learning period generalizes to new, related skills. Here, we addressed this question by investigating factors influencing generalization of early learning from a skill A to a different, but related skill B. Early skill generalization was tested over four experiments (N = 2,095). Subjects successively learned two related motor sequence skills (skills A and B) over different practice schedules. Skill A and B sequences shared ordinal (i.e. - matching keypress locations), transitional (i.e. - ordered keypress pairs), parsing rule (i.e., distinct sequence events like repeated keypresses that can be used as a breakpoint for segmenting the sequence into smaller units) structures, or possessed no structure similarities. Results showed generalization for shared parsing rule structure between skills A and B after only a single 10-second practice trial of skill A. Manipulating the initial practice exposure to skill A (1 to 12 trials) and inter-practice rest interval (0 to 30s) between skills A and B had no impact on parsing rule structure generalization. Furthermore, this generalization was not explained by stronger sensorimotor mapping between individual keypress actions and their symbolic representations. In contrast, learning from skill A did not generalize to skill B during early learning when the sequences shared only ordinal or transitional structure features. These results document sequence structure that can be very rapidly generalized during initial learning to facilitate generalization of skill.",

    "abstract": "The tendency for proteins to form aggregates is an inherent part of every proteome and arises from the self-assembly of short protein segments called aggregation-prone regions (APRs). While post-translational modifications (PTMs) have been implicated in modulating protein aggregation, their direct role in APRs remains poorly understood. In this study, we used a combination of proteome-wide computational analyses and biochemical techniques to investigate the potential involvement of PTMs in aggregation regulation. Our findings reveal that while most PTM types are disfavored near APRs, N-glycosylation is enriched and evolutionarily selected, especially in proteins prone to misfolding. Experimentally, we show that N-glycosylation inhibits the aggregation of peptides in vitro through steric hindrance. Moreover, mining existing proteomics data, we find that the loss of N-glycans at the flanks of APRs leads to specific protein aggregation in Neuro2a cells. Our results point towards a novel intrinsic role for N-glycosylation, directly preventing protein aggregation in eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "HBx is a multifunctional protein coded by the Hepatitis B virus which is involved in various cellular processes such as proliferation, cell survival/apoptosis, and histone methylation. HBx was reported to be associated with liver  cancer stem cells. The stemness inducing properties of HBx could also facilitate the generation of pluripotent stem cells from somatic cells. It is well established that somatic cells can be reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) using a cocktail of transcription factors called Yamanakas factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and MYC). The reprogramming process proceeds step-by-step with reprogramming factor chromatin interactions, transcription and chromatin states changing during transitions. HBx is a  broad spectrum trans-activator and therefore could facilitate these transitions. We electroporated low passage and high passage (difficult to reprogram) fibroblasts using Yamanakas factors (YF) with and without HBx and evaluated the reprogramming efficiency. We also investigated the tri-lineage and terminal differentiation potential of iPSC derived using HBx. We found, addition of HBx to YF, improves iPSC derivation, and increases the efficiency of iPSC generation from  difficult or hard-to-reprogram samples such as high passage/senescent fibroblasts. Furthermore, we show that HBx can substitute the key transcription factor MYC in the YF cocktail to generate iPSC. Our results have practical value in improving the efficiency of pluripotent stem cell derivation from  difficult to reprogram somatic cells in addition to providing some insights into the mechanisms of liver carcinogenesis in chronic hepatitis B. To conclude, HBx improves the reprogramming efficiency of YFs. HBx increases the cellular levels of OCT3/4 and MYC.\n\nLay summaryHBx is a protein made by hepatitis B virus. Yamanakas Factors (YF) are a mixture of  master-proteins which are used to convert adult cells to embryonic stem cells. We found that HBx protein can augment the efficiency of YF in generating these stem cells (concept summary figure).",

    "abstract": "Errors in mitosis can generate micronuclei that entrap mis-segregated chromosomes, which are susceptible to catastrophic fragmentation through a process termed chromothripsis. The reassembly of fragmented chromosomes by error-prone DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair generates a spectrum of simple and complex genomic rearrangements that are associated with human cancers and disorders. How specific DSB repair pathways recognize and process these lesions remains poorly understood. Here we used CRISPR/Cas9 to systematically inactivate distinct DSB processing or repair pathways and interrogated the rearrangement landscape of fragmented chromosomes from micronuclei. Deletion of canonical non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) components, including DNA-PKcs, LIG4, and XLF, substantially reduced the formation of complex rearrangements and shifted the rearrangement landscape toward simple alterations without the characteristic patterns of cancer-associated chromothripsis. Following reincorporation into the nucleus, fragmented chromosomes localize within micronuclei bodies (MN bodies) and undergo successful ligation by NHEJ within a single cell cycle. In the absence of NHEJ, chromosome fragments were rarely engaged by polymerase theta-mediated alternative end-joining or recombination-based mechanisms, resulting in delayed repair kinetics and persistent 53BP1-labeled MN bodies in the interphase nucleus. Prolonged DNA damage signaling from unrepaired fragments ultimately triggered cell cycle arrest. Thus, we provide evidence supporting NHEJ as the exclusive DSB repair pathway generating complex rearrangements following chromothripsis from mitotic errors.",
