    "abstract": "We investigated factors which might influence the circulation of ebolaviruses in fruit bats in Guinea in order to better understand their role in the ecology of ebolaviruses and evaluate risks of spill-over to other animals or humans. We performed serological tests on populations of 4 bat species (Eidolon helvum, Hypsignathus monstrosus, Lissonycteris angolensis and Rousettus aegyptiacus) sampled longitudinally for 18 months (2018-2020). The analysis of 1,427 bat samples for antibodies directed against different ebolavirus species allowed to test the influence of biological and environmental variables on seropositivity. Results showed that species (Eidolon helvum and Rousettus aegyptiacus), sex (males), age (sexually immature adults, and thus reproductive life-cycle), as well as season (dry) have a significant positive effect on the presence of antibodies against ebolaviruses in bats. These factors may play an important role in the circulation of filoviruses. Search for viral evidence and surveillance strategies should take these into consideration.",

    "abstract": "Photorhabdus asymbiotica is a species of the insect pathogenic Photorhabdus genus that has been isolated as an etiological agent in human infections. Since then, multiple isolates have been identified worldwide, however actual clinical infections have so far only been identified in North America, Australia and Nepal. Previous research on the clinical isolates had shown that the strains differed in their behaviour when infecting cultured human cells, based on the geographical site of isolation. In this study we investigate the differences between the pathogenic activities of P. asymbiotica isolates from different geographic locations. We present findings from the clinical isolates from Australia (Kingscliff) and North America (ATCC43949), and soil borne nematode isolates from Thailand (PB68) and Northern Europe non-clinical P. asymbiotica genospecies HIT and JUN. We also show the first findings from a new clinical isolate of P. luminescens (Texas), the first non-asymbiotica species to cause a human infection, confirming its ability to infect and survive inside human immune cells. Infection assays were done using both cultured cell lines (THP-1, CHO and HEK cells) and also primary immune cells, Peripheral Blood Mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from human blood. Here for the first time, we show how P. asymbiotica, selectively infects certain immune cells while avoiding others, and that infectivity varies depending on growth temperature. We also show that the infected immune cells vary depending on the geographical location a strain is isolated from, and that the European HIT and JUN strains lack the ability to survive within mammalian cells in tissue culture",

    "abstract": "A diverse group of RNA viruses including Rabies, Polio, La Crosse, West Nile, Zika, Nipah, Eastern and Western equine encephalitis, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses have the ability to gain access to and replicate in the central nervous system (CNS), causing severe neurological disease. Current treatment for these patients is generally limited to supportive care. To address the need for a generalizable antiviral, we utilized a strategy of mutagenesis to limit virus replication. We evaluated ribavirin (RBV), favipiravir (FAV) and N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC) against La Crosse virus (LACV) which is the primary cause of pediatric arboviral encephalitis cases in North America. NHC was more potent than RBV or FAV in neuronal cells. Oral administration of molnupiravir (MOV), the 5-isobutyryl prodrug of NHC, decreased neurological disease development by 32% following intraperitoneal (IP) infection of LACV. MOV also reduced disease by 23% when virus was administered intranasally (IN). NHC and MOV produced less fit viruses by incorporating predominantly G-to-A or C-to-U mutations. Furthermore, NHC also inhibited two other orthobunyaviruses, Jamestown Canyon virus and Cache Valley virus. Collectively, these studies indicate that NHC/MOV has therapeutic potential to inhibit virus replication and subsequent neurological disease caused by this neurotropic RNA virus.",

    "abstract": "The HIV-1 core consists of a cone-shaped capsid shell made of [~]250 capsid protein (CA) hexamers and 12 pentamers encapsulating the viral genome. HIV-1 capsid disassembly, referred to as uncoating, is a highly regulated process that is important for productive infection, however, the location, timing, and regulation of uncoating remain controversial. Here, we employ amber codon suppression to directly label CA and visualize capsid trafficking and uncoating in live cells. In addition to direct CA labeling, a fluid phase fluorescent probe is incorporated into the viral core to detect the formation of small defects in the capsid lattice. This double-labeling strategy does not significantly impact HIV-1 infectivity, maturation, nuclear import, or capsid stability. Single virus tracking reveals nuclear import of intact cores defined as complexes containing both the fluid phase marker and robust CA signal. Subsequent uncoating of HIV-1 cores in the nucleus is manifested by a sequential loss of both fluorescent markers. This two-step uncoating - release of the core content marker followed by loss of CA - is observed in different cells, including a macrophage line. Importantly, the lag between the two steps of uncoating ([~]30 min) appears independent of the cell type and is much longer than upon uncoating of cell-free viruses. These data suggest that HIV- 1 uncoating in the nucleus is initiated through a localized defect in the capsid lattice that precedes a global loss of CA. Our results imply that intact HIV-1 cores enter the cell nucleus and uncoat in a stepwise fashion, before integrating into the host genome.",

These proteins have similar as well as distinct functional properties, and here we first used AlphaFold2, an artificial intelligence-based structural prediction program, to obtain insight into the three-dimensional organization of their non-DNA binding/dimerization sequences. This analysis was conducted on the wildtype (WT) proteins as well the pathogenic MAFASer64Phe (MAFAS64F) and MAFBSer70Ala (MAFBS70A) mutants, with structural differences revealed between MAFAWT and MAFBWT in addition to MAFAS64F and MAFAWT, but not MAFBS70A and MAFBWT. Functional analysis disclosed that the inability to properly phosphorylate at S70 in MAFBS70A, like S65 in MAFAS64F, greatly increased protein stability and enabled MAFBS70A to accelerate cellular senescence in cultured cells. Significant differences were also observed in the ability of MAFA, MAFAS64F, MAFB, and MAFBS70A to cooperatively stimulate Insulin enhancer-driven activity in the presence of other islet-enriched transcription factors. Experiments performed on protein chimeras disclosed that these properties were greatly influenced by structural differences found between the WT and mutant proteins. In general, these results revealed that AlphaFold2 predicts features essential to protein activity.",

    "abstract": "Mice are often used in gain or loss of function studies to understand how genes regulate metabolism and adaptation to exercise in skeletal muscle. Once-daily resistance training with electrical nerve stimulation produces hypertrophy of the dorsiflexors in rat, but not in mouse. Using implantable pulse generators, we assessed the acute transcriptional response (1-hour post exercise) after 2, 10 and 20 days of training in free living mice and rats using identical nerve stimulation paradigms. RNA-sequencing revealed strong concordance in the timecourse of many transcriptional responses in the tibialis anterior muscles of both species including responses related to  stress responses/immediate-early genes, and  collagen homeostasis,  ribosomal subunits,  autophagy and  focal adhesion. However, pathways associated with energy metabolism including  carbon metabolism,  oxidative phosphorylation,  mitochondrial translation,  propanoate metabolism and  valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation were oppositely regulated between species. These pathways were suppressed in the rat but upregulated in the mouse. Our transcriptional analysis suggests that although many pathways associated with growth show remarkable similarities between species, absence of an actual growth response in the mouse may be because the mouse prioritises energy metabolism, specifically replenishment of fuel stores and intermediate metabolites.",

There is strong evidence that cohesin-mediated loop extrusion is involved but this does not appear to be a universal mechanism. Here, we identify an element within the mouse immunoglobulin lambda (Ig{lambda}) light chain locus, HSC{lambda}1, that has characteristics of active regulatory elements but lacks intrinsic enhancer or promoter activity. Remarkably, knock-out of the YY1 binding site from HSC{lambda}1 reduces Ig{lambda} transcription significantly and disrupts enhancer/promoter interactions, even though these elements are >10 kb from HSC{lambda}1. Genome-wide analyses of mouse embryonic stem cells identified 3503 similar YY1-bound, putative genome organizing elements that lie within CTCF/cohesin loop boundaries but that lack intrinsic enhancer activity.

    "abstract": "In mammals, the co-existence of RNAi and the type I interferon response in somatic cells begs the question of their compatibility and relative contribution during viral infection. Previous studies provided hints that both mitigating co-factors and self-limiting properties of key proteins such as Dicer could explain the apparent inefficiency of antiviral RNAi. Indeed, the helicase domain of human Dicer limits its processing activity and acts as an interaction platform for co-factors that could hinder its function. We studied the involvement of several helicase-truncated mutants of human Dicer in the antiviral response. We show that all deletion mutants display an antiviral phenotype against alphaviruses and an enterovirus. While only one of them, Dicer N1, is antiviral in an RNAi-independent manner, they all require the expression of PKR to be active. To elucidate the mechanism underlying the antiviral phenotype of Dicer N1 expressing cells, we analyzed their transcriptome and found that many genes from the interferon and inflammatory response were upregulated. We could show that these genes appear to be controlled by transcription factors such as STAT-1, STAT-2, and NF-kB. Finally, we demonstrated that blocking the NF-kB pathway in Dicer N1 cells abrogated their antiviral phenotype. Our findings highlight the crosstalk between Dicer, PKR, and the IFN-I pathway, and suggest that human Dicer may have repurposed its helicase domain to prevent basal activation of antiviral and inflammatory pathways.",

    "abstract": "Cancer is known as a heterogeneous disease. Cancer driver genes (CDGs) need to be inferred for understanding tumor heterogeneity in cancer. However, the existing computational methods have identified many common CDGs. A key challenge exploring cancer progression is to infer cancer subtype-specific driver genes (CSDGs), which provides guidane for the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of cancer. The significant advancements in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have opened up new possibilities for studying human cancers at the individual cell level. In this study, we develop a novel unsupervised method, CSDGI (Cancer Subtype-specific Driver Gene Inference), which applies Encoder-Decoder-Framework consisting of low-rank residual neural networks to inferring driver genes corresponding to potential cancer subtypes at single-cell level. To infer CSDGs, we apply CSDGI to the tumor single-cell transcriptomics data. To filter the redundant genes before driver gene inference, we perform the differential expression genes (DEGs). The experimental results demonstrate CSDGI is effective to infer driver genes that are cancer subtype-specific. Functional and disease enrichment analysis shows these inferred CSDGs indicate the key biological processes and disease pathways. CSDGI is the first method to explore cancer driver genes at the cancer subtype level. We believe that it can be a useful method to understand the mechanisms of cell transformation driving tumours.\n\nAuthor summaryCancer is recognized as a complex disease with diverse characteristics. In order to comprehend the diversity within tumors, it is essential to infer cancer subtype-specific driver genes (CSDGs), which offer valuable insights for investigating cancer progression and treatment. The remarkable progress made in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies has ushered in new prospects for studying human cancers at the cellular level. Cancer Subtype-specific Driver Gene Inference (CSDGI) is a novel unsupervised method proposed. In our study, we use Encoder-Decoder-Framework to infer driver genes specific to cancer subtypes in the CSDGI. We apply CSDGI to three tumor single-cell transcriptomics data. The experimental results have shown the effectiveness of CSDGI. Furthermore, functional and disease enrichment analyses illustrate that these inferred CSDGs shed light on crucial biological processes and disease pathways. Our collection of driver genes will serve as a valuable resource in unraveling the mechanisms driving cell transformation in tumors.",

    "abstract": "Predicting protein-DNA binding sites is a challenging computational problem that has led to the development of advanced algorithms and techniques in the field of bioinformatics. Identifying the specific residues where proteins bind to DNA is of paramount importance, as it enables the modeling of their interactions and facilitates downstream studies. Nevertheless, the development of accurate and efficient computational methods for this task remains a persistent challenge. Accurate prediction of protein-DNA binding sites has far-reaching implications for understanding molecular mechanisms, disease processes, drug discovery, and synthetic biology applications. It helps bridge the gap between genomics and functional biology, enabling researchers to uncover the intricacies of cellular processes and advance our knowledge of the biological world. The method used to predict DNA binding residues in this study is a potent combination of conventional bioinformatics tools, protein language models, and cutting-edge machine learning and deep learning classifiers. On a dataset of protein-DNA binding sites, our model is meticulously trained, and it is then rigorously examined using several experiments. As indicated by higher predictive behavior with AUC values on two benchmark datasets, the results show superior performance when compared to existing models. The suggested model has a strong capacity for generalization and shows specificity for DNA-binding sites. We further demonstrated the adaptability of our model as a universal framework for binding site prediction by training it on a variety of protein-ligand binding site datasets. In conclusion, our innovative approach for predicting protein-DNA binding residues holds great promise in advancing our understanding of molecular interactions, thus paving the way for several groundbreaking applications in the field of molecular biology and genetics.

    "abstract": "This survey paper provides an in-depth analysis of various machine learning techniques and algorithms that are utilized in the detection of PPI (Protein-Protein Interactions). For every technique examined, the paper evaluates its efficiency, shortcomings, possibilities for enhancement, and outlook for the future. A major challenge in current survey papers focusing on machine learning algorithms for PPI identification is the successful categorization of these algorithms. To overcome this challenge, the paper introduces a novel hierarchical taxonomy that organizes algorithms into more intricate categories and distinct techniques. The proposed taxonomy is constructed on a four-tier structure, beginning with the broad methodology category, and ending with specific sub-techniques. This structure facilitates a more systematic and exhaustive categorization of algorithms, aiding researchers in grasping the connections between different algorithms and techniques. Included in the paper are both empirical and experimental assessments to classify the various techniques. The empirical assessment judges the techniques according to four standards. The experimental evaluations carry out the following rankings: (1) the algorithms that employ the same specific sub-technique, (2) the different sub-techniques that employ the same technique, (3) the different techniques that employ the same methodology sub-category, and (4) the different methodology sub-categories within the same methodology category. By merging the new methodological taxonomy, empirical analyses, and experimental evaluations, the paper provides a multifaceted and thorough comprehension of the machine learning methods and algorithms for PPI detection. This synthesis helps researchers make well-informed decisions. In its conclusion, the paper furnishes crucial insights into the future possibilities of machine learning techniques for PPI identification, underscoring potential advancements and areas ripe for continued exploration and development.",

    "abstract": "Recent technological advancements in single-cell genomics have enabled joint profiling of gene expression and alternative modalities at unprecedented scale. Consequently, the complexity of multi-omics data sets is increasing massively. Existing models for multi-modal data are typically limited in functionality or scalability, making data integration and downstream analysis cumbersome. We present multiDGD, a scalable deep generative model providing a probabilistic framework to learn shared representations of transcriptome and chromatin accessibility. It shows outstanding performance on data reconstruction without feature selection. We demonstrate on several data sets from human and mouse that multiDGD learns well-clustered joint representations. We further find that probabilistic modelling of sample covatiates enables post-hoc data integration without the need for fine-tuning. Additionally, we show that multiDGD can detect statistical associations between genes and regulatory regions conditioned on the learned representations. multiDGD is available as an scverse-compatible package (https://github.com/Center-for-Health-Data-Science/multiDGD).",

For cellular resolution spatial mapping, we have developed deep learning-based SC2Spa to learn the intricate spatial mapping rules from the transcriptome to its location from ST data. Benchmarking tests show that SC2Spa uniquely recapitulates tissue architecture from scRNAseq. SC2Spa successfully mapped scRNAseq even to various low resolution Visium data. SC2Spa identified spatially variable genes and suggested negative regulatory relationships between genes. SC2Spa armored with deep learning provides a new way to map the transcriptome to its spatial location and perform subsequent analyses.",

    "abstract": "As vast histological archives are digitised, there is a pressing need to be able to associate specific tissue substructures and incident pathology to disease outcomes without arduous annotation. Such automation provides an opportunity to learn fundamental biology about how tissue structure and function varies in a population. Recently, self-supervised learning has proven competitive to supervised machine learning approaches in classification, segmentation and representation learning. Here, we leverage self-supervised learning to generate histology feature representations using 1.7M images across 23 healthy tissues in 838 donors from GTEx. Using these representations, we demonstrate we can automatically segment tissues into their constituent tissue substructures and pathology proportions, and surpass the performance of conventionally used pre-trained models. We observe striking population variability in canonical tissue substructures, highlight examples of missing pathological diagnoses, incorrect assignment of target tissue and cross-tissue contamination. We demonstrate that this variability in tissue composition leads to a likely overestimation of eQTL tissue sharing and drives dramatic differential gene expression changes. We use derived tissue substructures to detect 284 tissue substructures and pathology specific eQTLs. As our derived histology representations are rich morphological descriptors of the underlying tissue, we introduce a multiple instance learning model that can predict and spatially localise individual RNA expression levels directly from histology to specific substructures and pathological features. We validate our RNA spatial predictions with matched ground truth immunohistochemistry (IHC) for several well characterised marker genes, recapitulating their known spatial specificity. Finally, we derive a gene expression spatial enrichment metric, allowing us to detect genes specifically expressed within sites of pathology (e.g. arterial calcification). Together, these results demonstrate the power of self-supervised machine learning when applied to vast histological datasets to allow researchers to pose and answer questions about tissue pathology, its spatial organisation and the interplay between morphological tissue variability and gene expression.",

However, a snapshot of scCRISPR data may not lead to an accurate inference, since a gene knockout can influence multi-layered downstream over time. Here, we developed RENGE, a new computational method that infers GRNs using a time-series scCRISPR dataset. RENGE models the propagation process of the effects elicited by a gene knockout on its GRN. It can distinguish between direct and indirect regulations, which allows for the inference of regulations by genes that are not knocked out. RENGE therefore outperforms current methods in the accuracy of inferring GRNs. When used on a dataset we derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells, RENGE yielded a GRN consistent with multiple databases and literature. Accurate inference of GRNs by RENGE would enable the identification of key factors for various biological systems.",

As previous studies have defined many meaningful cell subtypes in several tumor types, there is a great need to computationally transfer these labels to new datasets. Also, different studies used different approaches or criteria to define the cell subtypes for the same major cell lineages. The relationships between the cell subtypes defined in different studies should be carefully evaluated. In this updated package scCancer2, designed for integrative tumor scRNA-seq data analysis, we developed a supervised machine learning framework to annotate TME cells with annotated cell subtypes from 15 scRNA datasets with 594 samples in total. Based on the trained classifiers, we quantitatively constructed the similarity maps between the cell subtypes defined in different references by testing on all the 15 datasets. Secondly, to improve the identification of malignant cells, we designed a classifier by integrating large-scale pan-cancer TCGA bulk gene expression datasets and scRNA-seq datasets (10 cancer types, 159 samples, 652,160 cells). This classifier shows robust performances when no internal confidential reference cells are available. Thirdly, this package also integrated a module to process the seq-based spatial transcriptomic data and analyze the spatial features of TME.

    "abstract": "A significant body of experimental structures of the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimers for the BA.1 and BA.2 variants revealed a considerable plasticity of the spike protein and emergence of druggable cryptic pockets. Understanding of the interplay of conformational dynamics changes induced by Omicron variants and identification of cryptic dynamic binding pockets in the S protein are of paramount importance as exploring broad-spectrum antiviral agents to combat the emerging variants is imperative. In the current study we explore conformational landscapes and characterize the universe of cryptic binding pockets in multiple open and closed functional spike states of the Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants. By using a combination of atomistic simulations, dynamics network analysis, and allostery-guided network screening of cryptic pockets in the conformational ensembles of BA.1 and BA.2 spike conformations, we identified all experimentally known allosteric sites and discovered significant variant-specific differences in the distribution of cryptic binding sites in the BA.1 and BA.2 trimers. This study provided in-depth structural analysis of the predicted allosteric site in the context of all available experimental information, revealing a critical role and effect of conformational plasticity on the distribution and function of allosteric binding sites. The results detailed how mutational and conformational changes in the BA.1 and BA.2 pike trimers can modulate the functional role of druggable allosteric pockets across different functional regions of the spike protein. The results of this study are particularly significant for understanding the universe of cryptic bindings sites and variant-specific preferences for druggable pockets. Exploring predicted druggable sites can present a new and previously underappreciated opportunity for therapeutic intervention of Omicron variants through conformation-selective and variant-specific targeting of functional sites involved in allosteric changes.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) frequently mediate liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) that underlies the formation of membraneless organelles. Together with theory and experiment, efficient coarse-grained (CG) simulations have been instrumental in understanding sequence- specific phase separation of IDPs. However, the widely-used C-only models are severely limited in capturing the peptide nature of IDPs, including backbone-mediated interactions and effects of secondary structures, in LLPS. Here, we describe a hybrid resolution (HyRes) protein model for accurate description of the backbone and transient secondary structures in LLPS. With an atomistic backbone and coarse-grained side chains, HyRes accurately predicts the residue helical propensity and chain dimension of monomeric IDPs. Using GY-23 as a model system, we show that HyRes is efficient enough for direct simulation of spontaneous phase separation, and at the same time accurate enough to resolve the effects of single mutations. HyRes simulations also successfully predict increased beta-sheet formation in the condensate, consistent with available experimental data. We further utilize HyRes to study the phase separation of TPD-43, where several disease-related mutants in the conserved region (CR) have been shown to affect residual helicities and modulate LLPS propensity. The simulations successfully recapitulate the effect of these mutants on the helicity and LLPS propensity of TDP-43 CR. Analyses reveal that the balance between backbone and sidechain-mediated interactions, but not helicity itself, actually determines LLPS propensity. We believe that the HyRes model represents an important advance in the molecular simulation of LLPS and will help elucidate the coupling between IDP transient secondary structures and phase separation.",

The radical is highly immobilized by CB-7, as indicated by the increase of the rotational correlation time,{tau} rot, by a factor of 36, relative to that in the buffer solution. The X-ray structure of ClA-DZD@CB-7 shows the encapsulated DZD guest inside the undistorted CB-7 host, with the pendant group protruding outside. Upon addition of CB-7 to T4 Lysozyme (T4L) doubly spin-labeled with the iodoacetamide derivative of DZD, we observe the increase in{tau} rot and electron spin coherence time, Tm, along with the narrowing of inter-spin distance distributions. Sensitivity of the DEER measurements at 83 K increases by a factor 4 - 9, compared to the common spin label such as MTSL, which is not affected by CB-7. Inter-spin distances of 3-nm could be reliably measured in water/glycerol up to temperatures near the glass transition/melting temperature of the matrix at 200 K, thus bringing us closer to the goal of supramolecular recognition-enabled long-distance DEER measurements at near physiological temperatures. The X-ray structure of DZD-T4L 65 at 1.12 [A] resolution allows for unambiguous modeling of the DZD label (0.88 occupancy), indicating undisturbed structure and conformation of the protein.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=107 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/554361v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (30K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1171bd0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@231612org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17e22e5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@250f1b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Interactions between membrane proteins (MPs) and lipid bilayers are critical for many cellular functions. In the Rosetta molecular modeling suite, the implicit membrane energy function is based on a \"slab\" model, which represent the membrane as a flat bilayer. However, in nature membranes often have a curvature that is important for function and/or stability. Even more prevalent, in structural biology research MPs are reconstituted in model membrane systems such as micelles, bicelles, nanodiscs, or liposomes. Thus, we have modified the existing membrane energy potentials within the RosettaMP framework to allow users to model MPs in different membrane geometries. We show that these modifications can be utilized in core applications within Rosetta such as structure refinement, protein-protein docking, and protein design. For MPs structures found in curved membranes, refining these structures in curved, implicit membranes produces higher quality models with structures closer to experimentally determined structures. For MP systems embedded in multiple membranes, representing both membranes results in more favorable scores compared to only representing one of the membranes. Modeling MPs in geometries mimicking the membrane model system used in structure determination can improve model quality and model discrimination.",

    "abstract": "The compartmentalization of the plasma membrane is a fundamental feature of cells. The diffusivity of membrane proteins in the plane of the membrane is significantly lower in cells than observed in artificial membranes. This seems due to the sub-membranous actin cortex, but tractable assays to prove a direct dependence of membrane protein motion on actin filaments have been elusive. We recently showed that a periodic array of sub-membrane actin filaments that surround neuronal axons in ring-like structures in the axonal initial segment (AIS) confines membrane protein motion between them, but the local enrichment of ion channels may offer an alternative explanation for compartmentalization. Here we show using computational modeling that in contrast to actin rings, the dense array of ion channels in the AIS cannot mediate membrane protein confinement. We go on to show that indeed the actin rings are closely apposed to the plasma membrane, and that they confine membrane protein motion between them in a [~] 200 nm periodic pattern in progenitor-derived neuronal cells. We find that this compartmentalization is also detectable for inner-leaflet membrane proteins and multi-spanning receptors. Strikingly, several cell types with actin rings in their protrusions, like progenitor-derived astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, also exhibit lateral confinement of membrane proteins in a periodic pattern consistent with actin ring spacing. Actin ring-mediated membrane compartmentalization is thus not unique to neurons. Finally, we show that acute actin disruption in live progenitor-derived neuronal cells leads to a loss of membrane compartmentalization in areas that were compartmentalized before treatment. Taken together, we here develop a much-needed tractable experimental system for the investigation of membrane compartmentalization and show that actin rings compartmentalize the plasma membrane of cells.",

    "abstract": "Magnesium ions (Mg2+) play an essential role in cellular physiology. In mitochondria, protein and ATP synthesis and various metabolic pathways are directly regulated by Mg2+. MRS2, a magnesium channel located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, mediates the influx of Mg2+ into the mitochondrial matrix and regulates Mg2+ homeostasis. Knockdown of MRS2 in human cells leads to reduced uptake of Mg2+ into mitochondria and disruption of the mitochondrial metabolism. Despite the importance of MRS2, the Mg2+ translocation and regulation mechanisms of MRS2 are still unclear. Here, using cryo-EM we determined the structure of human MRS2 in the presence and absence of Mg2+ at 2.8 [A] and 3.3 [A], respectively. From the homo-pentameric structures, we identified R332 and M336 as major gating residues, which were then tested using mutagenesis and two cellular divalent ion uptake assays. A network of hydrogen bonds was found connecting the gating residue R332 to the soluble domain, potentially regulating the gate. Two Mg2+-binding sites were identified in the MRS2 soluble domain, distinct from the two sites previously reported in CorA, a homolog of MRS2 in prokaryotes. Altogether, this study provides the molecular basis for understanding the Mg2+ translocation and regulatory mechanisms of MRS2.",

Spheroids support tumor metastasis as vehicles of dissemination, promoting growth and survival of bulk tumor and cancer stem cells within the mobile tumor cell population. Deciphering how spheroid architecture affects tumor cell phenotype will be essential for the development of therapeutics to inhibit transperitoneal metastasis and the development of peritoneal carcinomatosis by ovarian cancers. We investigated how spheroid formation directly affects OXPHOS activity and microRNA expression in a cultured ovarian carcinoma cell system. The rate of oxidative phosphorylation/respiration per cell in spheroids was nearly double that of the same cell type growing in suspension as single cells. Cells growing as spheroids showed greatly enhanced expression of miR-221/222, an oncomiR that targets multiple tumor suppressor genes, promotes invasion, as well as reduced expression of miR-9, which targets mitochondrial tRNA-modification enzymes and inhibits OXPHOS. Consistent with the greater efficiency of ATP generation afforded by OXPHOS phosphorylation, tumor cells growing as spheroids injected into the nutrient-poor environment of the murine peritoneum survived longer than the cells growing in suspension as loosely associated aggregates. The data suggest that in addition to the reported effects of spheroid formation on cancer cell growth and phenotype, including promotion of stem cell generation, spheroid architecture increases the OXPHOS activity of constituent tumor cells. During the mobile phase of metastasis, when ovarian tumor cells disperse through nutrient-poor environments such as the peritoneum, enhanced OXPHOS activity afforded by spheroid architecture would enhance survival and thereby contribute to metastatic potential.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a highly prevalent and deadly disease that is largely refractory to immunotherapy. The only CRC subset that responds to these therapies is characterized by prevalent microsatellite instability (MSI), extensive CD8+ T cell infiltration and high expression of innate immune signaling pathways. Endogenous activation of the cGAS/STING pathway is essential for the CD8+ T cell antitumor response in MSI CRCs, suggesting that activating it in other CRCs could boost immunotherapy response rates. We show that cGAS/STING signaling can be enhanced by costimulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and that dual stimulation increases CD8+ T cell-mediated antitumor immunity in both MSI and non-MSI CRCs. The ability of NLRP3 to boost cGAS/STING signaling was specific and did not occur with activation of other innate immune pathways such as AIM2 or TLRs. Cooperativity between cGAS/STING and NLRP3 proceeded via a positive feedback loop that was inflammasome-independent and required early crosstalk between the signaling mediators and regulation of their gene expression. Notably, increased cGAS/STING signaling enhanced CD8+ T cell activation when in conjunction with anti-PD1 immunotherapy, suggesting that signaling via NLRP3 could further boost this response and render otherwise resistant CRC susceptible to immunotherapy.\n\nSignificanceInnate immune signaling pathways cooperatively regulate CD8+ T cell-mediated antitumor immunity in both hot and cold tumors. In addition to serving as predictive biomarkers, these pathways can be therapeutically targeted to increase response rates to immunotherapy while minimizing undesirable adverse events.",

However, mechanisms by which microbial communities and metabolites contribute to reflux-driven EAC remain incompletely understood and challenging to target. Herein, we utilized a rat reflux-induced EAC model to investigate targeting the gut microbiome-esophageal metabolome axis with cranberry proanthocyanidins (C-PAC) to inhibit EAC progression. Sprague Dawley rats, with or without reflux-induction received water or C-PAC ad libitum (700 {micro}g/rat/day) for 25 or 40 weeks. C-PAC exerted prebiotic activity abrogating reflux-induced dysbiosis, and mitigating bile acid metabolism and transport, culminating in significant inhibition of EAC through TLR/NF-{kappa}B/P53 signaling cascades. At the species level, C-PAC mitigated reflux-induced pathogenic bacteria (Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis). C-PAC specifically reversed reflux-induced bacterial, inflammatory and immune-implicated proteins and genes including Ccl4, Cd14, Crp, Cxcl1, Il6, Il1{beta}, Lbp, Lcn2, Myd88, Nfkb1, Tlr2 and Tlr4 aligning with changes in human EAC progression, as confirmed through public databases. C-PAC is a safe promising dietary constituent that may be utilized alone or potentially as an adjuvant to current therapies to prevent EAC progression through ameliorating reflux-induced dysbiosis, inflammation and cellular damage.",

    "abstract": "CO2 recycle is crucial to the global carbon neutrality. Though cyanobacteria are known to be photoautotrophic cell factories capable of converting CO2 into valuable chemicals, their slower growth rate and lower biomass accumulation compared to those of the heterotrophic organisms significantly restrict their application at commercial scale. The newly discovered marine cyanobacterium, Synechococcus sp. PCC 11901 (hereafter PCC 11901) offers several advantages like rapid growth, high biomass and high salinity tolerance, and could become a new generation of cyanobacterial chassis. To promote its application, in this study we developed genetic toolboxes applicable to PCC 11901. First, a cobalamin (VB12)-independent chassis was constructed, allowing for its cheaper cultivation. Second, genome copy numbers and transformation methods were respectively measured and optimized. The 14 neutral sites were identified and characterized within the genome PCC 11901, providing locations for genetic integration of exogenous cassettes. Subsequently, libraries were developed, reaching an expression range of approximately 800 folds for constitutive promoters and an induction fold of up to approximately 400 for inducible promotor, respectively. As a proof of concept of its utilization, we engineered the synthetic pathways of glucosylglycerol (GG) into PCC 11901 using the established toolboxes, yielding about 590.41 mg/L for GG production. Notably, we found the cobalamin-independent PCC 11901 chassis exhibited superior self-sedimentation ability compared to the wild-type chassis. Our work here made it possible to develop the fast-growing PCC 11901 as efficient carbon-neutral cell factory in the future.",

    "abstract": "Towards the goal of building synthetic cells from the bottom-up, the establishment of micrometer-sized compartments that contain and support cell free transcription and translation that couple cellular structure to function is of critical importance. Proteinosomes, formed from crosslinked cationized protein-polymer conjugates offer a promising solution to membrane-bound compartmentalisation with an open, semi-permeable membrane. Critically, to date, there have been no demonstration of cell free transcription and translation within water-in-water proteinosomes. Herein, we present a novel approach to the fabrication of proteinosomes directly from native protein-polymer (BSA-PNIPAAm) conjugates. We show that these native proteinosomes offer an excellent alternative as artificial cell chassis. Significantly, the native proteinosomes are stable under high salt conditions and can consequently support cell free transcription and translation. The native proteinosomes offer enhanced protein expression compared to proteinosomes prepared from traditional methodologies. Furthermore, we demonstrate the integration of proteinosomes into higher order cellular architectures with membrane free compartments and liposomes. The integration of bioinspired architectural elements with the central dogma is an essential building block for realizing minimal synthetic cells and is key for exploiting artificial cells in real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "Many experiments showed that eukaryotic cells maintain a constant mRNA concentration upon various perturbations by actively regulating transcription and degradation rates, known as mRNA buffering. However, the mechanism of mRNA buffering is still unknown. In this study, we propose a mechanistic model of mRNA buffering called the releasing-shuttling (RS) model. The model incorporates two crucial factors, X and Y, which play significant roles in the transcription, exportation, and degradation processes. The model successfully explains the constant mRNA concentration under genome-wide genetic perturbations and volume changes. Moreover, it quantitatively explains the slowed-down mRNA degradation after Pol II depletion and the temporal transcription dynamics after Xrn1 depletion. The RS model suggests that X and Y are likely composed of multiple molecules possessing redundant functions. We also present a list of potential X and Y candidates and an experimental method to identify X. Our work sheds light on a novel coupling mechanism between mRNA transcription, exportation, and degradation.",

    "abstract": "A cell constantly receives signals and takes different fates accordingly. Given the uncertainty rendered by signal transduction noise, the cell may incorrectly perceive the signals. It may mistakenly behave as if there is a signal - although there is none, or may miss the presence of a signal that actually exists. In this paper, we consider a signaling system that has two outputs, and introduce and develop methods to model and compute key cell decision making parameters based on the two outputs, and in response to the input signal. In the considered system, the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) regulates the two transcription factors, the nuclear factor {kappa}B (NF{kappa}B) and the activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2). These two system outputs are involved in important physiological functions such as cell death and survival, viral replication, and pathological conditions such as autoimmune diseases and different types of cancer. Using the introduced methods, we compute and show what the decision thresholds are, based on the single cell measured concentration levels of NF{kappa}B and ATF-2. We also define and compute the decision error probabilities, i.e., false alarm and miss probabilities, based on the concentration levels of the two outputs. By considering the joint response of the two outputs of a signaling system, one can learn more about complex cellular decision making processes, the corresponding decision error rates, and their possible involvement in the development of some pathological conditions.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression is a stochastic process that leads to variability in mRNA and protein abundances even within an isogenic population of cells grown in the same environment. This variation, often called gene-expression noise, has typically been attributed to transcriptional and translational processes while ignoring the contributions of protein decay variability across cells. Here we estimate the single-cell protein decay rates of two degron GFPs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using time-lapse microscopy. We find substantial cell-to-cell variability in the decay rates of the degron GFPs. We evaluate cellular features that explain the variability in the proteasomal decay and find that the amount of 20s catalytic beta subunit of the proteasome marginally explains the observed variability in the degron GFP half-lives. We propose alternate hypotheses that might explain the observed variability in the decay of the two degron GFPs. Overall, our study highlights the importance of studying the kinetics of the decay process at single-cell resolution and that decay rates vary at the single-cell level, and that the decay process is stochastic. A complex model of decay dynamics must be included when modeling stochastic gene expression to estimate gene expression noise.",

    "abstract": "Non-linear mixed-effects models are a powerful tool for studying heterogeneous populations in various fields, including biology, medicine, economics, and engineering. However, fitting these models to data is computationally challenging if the description of individuals is complex and the population is large. To address this issue, we propose a novel machine learning-based approach: We exploit neural density estimation based on normalizing flows to approximate individual-specific posterior distributions in an amortized fashion, thereby allowing for an efficient inference of population parameters. Applying this approach to problems from cell biology and pharmacology, we demonstrate its scalability to large data sets in an unprecedented manner. Moreover, we show that it enables accurate uncertainty quantification and extends to stochastic models, which established methods, such as SAEM and FOCEI are unable to handle. Thus, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods and improves the analysis capabilities for heterogeneous populations.",

They showcase comparable efficacy when compared with DNA methylation age predictors through simulation experiments. Intriguingly, our gene set enrichment analysis pinpoints vital developmental pathways crucial for age prediction. Unlike in DNA methylation age predictors, genes previously recognized in animal studies as integral to aging are amongst the most important features of our models. We also introduce a pan-histone-mark, pan-tissue age predictor that operates across multiple tissues and histone marks, reinforcing that age-related epigenetic markers are not restricted to particular histone modifications.\n\nConclusionOur findings underscore the potential of histone marks in crafting robust age predictors and shed light on the intricate tapestry of epigenetic alterations in aging.",

    "abstract": "Riptortus pedestris (Fabricius) a major soybean pest migrates into soybean fields during pod filling stage resulting in a leaf and stem staygreen while pods without beans syndrome. Given the agricultural importance of this species and the lack of characterized HAMP from piercing-sucking insects we performed a large scale of screening by expression of 87 R. pedestris salivary proteins with signal peptides in Nicotiana benthamiana obtaining a candidate HAMP RPH1. RPH1 activated a series of PTI responses including ROS burst upregulation of defense marker genes such as PR1 WRKY7 WRKY8 Acre31 and CYP71D20 MAPK activation and biosynthesis of phytohormones in plants. RPH1 significantly enhances soybean resistance against R. pedestris feeding. PRR coreceptors BAK1 and SOBIR1 were required for RPH1-induced PTI responses. Remarkably RPH1 homologs were widely distributed in herbivorous insects and majority of homologs from selected species induced cell death or ROS. Thus our results demonstrated that RPH1 is a conserved HAMP within chewing and piercing-sucking insects. We also discovered that R. pedestris evolved four paralogs to overcome the plant immunity triggered by RPH1. This study filled a major gap of HAMP identification from piercing-sucking insect and also deciphered a novel evasion strategy of plant immunity exploited by herbivorous insects.\n\nOne sentence summaryRiptortus pedestris RPH1, a conserved HAMP in herbivores, activates a variety of PTI responses in plants.

    "abstract": "Pressurized cells with strong walls make up the hydrostatic skeleton of plants. Assembly and expansion of such stressed walls depend on a family of secreted RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR (RALF) peptides which, curiously, bind both a membrane receptor complex and wall-localized LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT EXTENSINs (LRXs) in a mutually exclusive way. Here we show that, in root hairs, the RALF22 peptide has a dual structural and signaling role in cell expansion. Together with LRX1, it directs the compaction of charged pectin polymers at the root hair tip into periodic circumferential rings. Free RALF22 induces the formation of a complex with LORELEI-LIKE-GPI-ANCHORED PROTEIN 1 (LLG1) and FERONIA (FER), triggering adaptive cellular responses. These findings show how a peptide simultaneously functions as a structural component organizing cell wall architecture and as a signaling molecule that regulates this process. This mechanism may also underlie wall assembly and expansion in other plant cell types.",
