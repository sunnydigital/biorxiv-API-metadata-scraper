    "abstract": "The increasing scarcity of organs and the significant morbidity linked to dialysis requires the development of engineered kidney tissues from human-induced pluripotent stem cells. To accomplish this, integrative approaches that synergize scalable kidney organoid differentiation, tissue biomanufacturing, and comprehensive assessment of their immune response and host integration are essential. Here, we create engineered human kidney tissues composed of kidney organoid building blocks (OBBs) and transplant them into mice reconstituted with allogeneic human immune cells. We assess their host vascular integration, in vivo maturation, and their ability to trigger human immune responses. Tissue-infiltrating human immune cells are composed of effector T cells and innate cells. This immune infiltration leads to kidney tissue injury characterized by reduced microvasculature, enhanced kidney cell apoptosis, and a unique inflammatory gene signature comparable to kidney organ transplant rejection in humans. Upon treatment with the immunosuppressive agent Rapamycin, the induced immune response is greatly suppressed. Our model serves as a translational platform to study engineered kidney tissue immunogenicity and develop novel therapeutic targets for kidney rejection.",

    "abstract": "The load-bearing capabilities of tendon are acquired during neonatal stages of development, characterized by an abrupt increase in multiscale mechanical properties. While prior work has identified numerous changes within the collagenous structure during these developmental periods, the primary structural elements that give rise to this abrupt mechanical functionality, and their mechanobiological sensitivity, remains unclear. To address this gap in knowledge, we leveraged a combination of ultrastructural imaging, biochemical/thermodynamic assays, multiscale mechanical testing, and shear lag modeling to probe the dynamic structure-function relationships and establish their sensitivity to mechanical stimulation during tenogenesis. Mechanical testing and modeling suggested that the rapid increase in multiscale mechanics can be explained by a increasing fibril length and intrafibrillar crosslinking. To test this, we inhibited collagen crosslinking during development and observed a drastic reduction in multiscale mechanical capabilities that was explained by a reduction in both fibril modulus and length. Using muscle paralysis to investigate mechanosensitivity, we observed a significantly impaired multiscale mechanical response despite small changes in fibril diameter and fibril area fraction. While there was no change in crosslinking density, there was a decrease in thermal stability with flaccid paralysis, and our shear-lag model suggested that flaccid paralysis produces a reduction in fibril length and intrafibrillar crosslinking. Together, these data suggest that both intrafibrillar crosslink formation and fibril elongation are critical to the formation of load-bearing capabilities in tenogenesis and are sensitive to musculoskeletal activity. These findings provide critical insights into the biological mechanisms that give rise to load-bearing soft tissue.",

The majority of these tools apply diverse statistical models to assign a quantitative protein value from the mass-spectrometry information. Here we present iSanXoT, a standalone application that allows integrative analysis of quantitative proteomics data. iSanXoT processes relative abundances between MS signals and integrates them sequentially to upper levels using our previously published Generic Integration Algorithm (GIA). iSanXoT offers unique capabilities that complement conventional quantitative softwares, including statistical weighting and independent modeling of error distributions in each integration, aggregation of technical or biological replicates, quantification of posttranslational modifications or analysis of coordinated protein behavior. iSanXoT is a standalone, user-friendly application which accepts output from widespread proteomics pipelines and enables free construction of quantification workflows and fully customizable reports than can be reused across different projects or shared among users. Diverse integrative workflows constructed using GIA for the analysis of high-throughput quantitative proteomics experiments have been successfully applied in numerous publications. iSanXoT has been tested with the main operating systems.

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) genome organization, which determines how the DNA is packaged inside the nucleus, has emerged as a key component of the gene regulation machinery. The availability of high-throughput chromosome conformation datasets, such as Hi-C, across multiple conditions and time points offer a unique opportunity to examine changes in 3D genome organization and link them to phenotypic changes in normal and diseases processes. However, systematic detection of higher-order structural changes across multiple Hi-C datasets is a major challenge. Existing computational methods either do not model higher-order structural units or cannot model dynamics across more than two conditions of interest. We address these limitations with Tree-Guided Integrated Factorization (TGIF), a generalizable multi-task Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) approach that can applied to time series or hierarchically related biological conditions. TGIF can identify large-scale compartmental changes as well as smaller topologically associated domain-level changes. Compared to existing methods, TGIF identifies has fewer false positive TAD boundary changes. Application to two mammalian developmental time courses provides multi-scale characterization of genome dynamics that we validate with enrichment of one-dimensional regulatory signals from histone modifications, accessibility and architectural proteins. Finally, we leverage TGIF boundaries to prioritize sequence variants for multiple phenotypes from the NHGRI GWAS catalog. Taken together, TGIF is a flexible tool to examine 3D genome organization dynamics across disease and developmental processes.",

    "abstract": "Single-particle tracking (SPT) techniques are essential for investigating the com-plex functions and interactions of individual, specifically labelled particles in biological environments. Many SPT techniques exist, each optimised towards a different balance between spatiotemporal resolution and range, technical com-plexity, and information content. This bargain is exemplified by the contrast between wide-field camera-based and real-time SPT approaches, with the latter being generally more advanced but at the cost of high complexity. Further-more, the fluorescence lifetime, a powerful tool for investigating the particles interactions and nano-environment, has yet to be measured consistently.\n\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose a novel real-time three-dimensional SPT technique based on a hybrid approach. In our implementation, we equip a confocal laser-scanning microscope with an asynchronous read-out single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array detector and few other optics. Each sensitive detector element acts as a confocal pinhole, and the recorded intensity distribu-tion reflects the particles position in three dimensions relative to the excitation volume. This localization is used in a real-time feedback system to keep the par-ticle in the centre of the excitation volume. Importantly, as each pixel is an independent single-photon detector, SPT is combined with fluorescence lifetime measurement.\n\nOur system achieves a localization precision of up to 30 nm with 100 photons and microsecond time resolution, while also performing fluorescence lifetime mea-surements. First, we validated the technique by tracking fluorescent particles in artificial environments. Secondly, as further validation, we investigated the move-ment of lysosomes in living SK-N-BE cells and measured the fluorescence lifetime of the GFP marker expressed on a membrane protein. We observed an unprece-dented correlation between the changes in fluorescence lifetime and the motion state of the lysosomes.\n\nThanks to its simplicity and the great momentum of confocal microscopy based on SPAD array detector, we expect that this implementation will open to many information-rich correlative imaging and tracking studies.",

The structurally conserved TRPM cytoplasmic domains make up > 70 % of the total protein. To investigate the mechanism by which the TRPM cytoplasmic domains contribute to gating, we employed electrophysiology and cryo-EM to study TRPM5 - a channel that primarily relies on activation via intracellular Ca2+. Here we show that activation of mammalian TRPM5 channels is strongly altered by desensitization. Structures of rat TRPM5 identify a series of conformational transitions triggered by Ca2+ binding. These transitions involve formation and dissolution of cytoplasmic inter-protomer interfaces, where the MHR1/2 domain and the rib helix play important roles.

Mutations generated by APOBEC3 cytidine deaminases can contribute to genetic variation and the consequences of APOBEC activation differ depending on the stage of cancer, with the most significant impact observed during the early stages. However, how APOBEC activity shapes evolutionary patterns of genes in the host genome and differential impacts on cancer-associated and non-cancer genes remain unclear. Analyzing over 40,000 human protein-coding transcripts, we identified distinct distribution patterns of APOBEC3A/B TC motifs between cancer-related genes and controls, suggesting unique associations with cancer. Studying a bat species with many more APOBEC3 genes, we found diverse motif patterns in orthologs of cancer genes compared to controls, similar to humans and suggesting APOBEC evolution to reduce impacts on the genome rather than the converse. Simulations confirmed that APOBEC-induced heterogeneity enhances cancer evolution, shaping clonal dynamics through bimodal introduction of mutations in certain classes of genes. Our results suggest that a major consequence of the bimodal distribution of APOBEC affects greater cancer heterogeneity.\n\nHighlightsO_LIUsing a measure of the extent which genes are affected by APOBEC activity, we found that many genes are maximally robust in the human genome.

Cancer cells are known to release extracellular vesicles (EVs) that contribute to cancer progression, but how cancer cell-derived EVs promote cancer growth and metastasis remains poorly understood. We have recently reported that levels of circulating gastric cancer cell-derived EVs (gcEVs) and the adhesive ligand von Willebrand factor (VWF) are associated with cancer metastasis and poor prognosis of patients, but the underlying mechanism of this gcEV-VWF interaction was not known. Here we report results from a study designed to investigate the synergistic action of VWF and gcEVs in vitro and in mouse models. We showed that VWF in cancer-bearing mice was hyperadhesive and became microvesicle-bound. EV-bound VWF mediated the adhesion of gcEVs to the endothelium to disrupt endothelial integrity and facilitate the transendothelial migration of cancer cells and pulmonary metastasis. Reducing VWF adhesive activity by the metalloprotease ADAMTS-13 or promoting gcEV clearance by the scavenging factor lactadherin prevented pulmonary metastasis in mice. These results highlight the synergistic action of gcEVs and VWF in promoting gastric cancer metastasis and identifying new targets for its prevention.\n\nKey point: Author contributionsO_LIHyperadhesive VWF becomes microvesicle-bound to induce endothelial leakage and promote the pulmonary metastasis of gastric cancer in mice.\nC_LIO_LIReducing VWF activity by ADAMTS-13 and accelerating microvesicle clearance by lactadherin reduces pulmonary metastasis of gastric cancer.\nC_LI",

The in vivo efficacy was evaluated by a mouse xenograft model. Sch B reduced cell proliferation and triggered apoptosis in human colon cancer cell lines. Raman spectroscopy, computational, RNA-seq, molecular and cellular studies revealed that Sch B activated unfolded protein responses by interacting with CHOP and upregulating CHOP, which thereby induced apoptosis. CHOP knockdown alleviated the Sch B-induced reduction in cell viability and apoptosis. Sch B reduced colon tumour growth in vivo.

Temporal transcriptome analysis, snRNAseq and immunohistochemistry showed that after CNS injury, local mature astrocytes dedifferentiated, proliferated, and became transcriptionally reprogrammed to permanently altered new functional states, with persisting downregulation of molecules associated with astrocyte-neuron interactions, and upregulation of molecules associated with wound healing, microbial defense, and interactions with stromal and immune cells.

    "abstract": "Our minds and brains are highly unique. Despite the long-recognized importance of the environment in shaping individual differences in cognitive neurodevelopment, only with the combination of deep phenotyping approaches and the availability of large-scale datasets have we been able to more comprehensively characterize the many inter-connected features of an individuals environment and experience (\"exposome\"). Moreover, despite clear evidence that brain organization is highly individualized, most neuroimaging studies still rely on group atlases to define functional networks, smearing away inter-individual variation in the spatial layout of functional networks across the cortex (\"functional topography\"). Here, we leverage the largest longitudinal study of brain and behavior development in the United States to investigate how an individuals exposome may contribute to functional brain network organization leading to differences in cognitive functioning. To do so, we apply three previously-validated data driven computational models to characterize an individuals multidimensional exposome, define individual-specific maps of functional brain networks, and measure cognitive functioning across broad domains. In pre-registered analyses replicated across matched discovery (n=5,139, 48.5% female) and replication (n=5,137, 47.1% female) samples, we find that a childs exposome is associated with multiple domains of cognitive functioning both at baseline assessment and two years later - over and above associations with baseline cognition. Cross-validated ridge regression models reveal that the exposome is reflected in childrens unique patterns of functional topography. Finally, we uncover both shared and unique contributions of the exposome and functional topography to cognitive abilities, finding that models trained on a single variable capturing a childs exposome can more accurately and parsimoniously predict future cognitive performance than models trained on a wealth of personalized neuroimaging data. This study advances our understanding of how childhood environments contribute to unique patterns of functional brain organization and variability in cognitive abilities.",

    "abstract": "Anticipating future events is a key computational task for neuronal networks. Experimental evidence suggests that reliable temporal sequences in neural activity play a functional role in the association and anticipation of events in time. However, how neurons can differentiate and anticipate multiple spike sequences remains largely unknown. We implement a learning rule based on predictive processing, where neurons exclusively fire for the initial, unpredictable inputs in a spiking sequence, leading to an efficient representation with reduced post-synaptic firing. Combining this mechanism with inhibitory feedback leads to sparse firing in the network, enabling neurons to selectively anticipate different sequences in the input. We demonstrate that intermediate levels of inhibition are optimal to decorrelate neuronal activity and to enable the prediction of future inputs. Notably, each sequence is independently encoded in the sparse, anticipatory firing of the network. Overall, our results demonstrate that the interplay of self-supervised predictive learning rules and inhibitory feedback enables fast and efficient classification of different input sequences.",

    "abstract": "Mapping the chimpanzee brain connectome, and comparing it to humans, is key to our understanding of similarities and differences in primate evolution that occurred after the split from their common ancestor around 6 million years ago. In contrast with macaque species brain studies, less studies have specifically addressed the structural connectivity of the chim-panzee brain and its comparison with the human brain. Most comparative studies in the liter-ature focus on the anatomy of the cortex and deep nuclei to evaluate how their morphometry and asymmetry differs from that of the human brain, and some studies have emerged concern-ing the study of brain connectivity between primates. In this work, we established a new white matter atlas of the deep and superficial white matter structural connectivity in chimpanzees. In vivo anatomical and diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were collected on a 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system in 39 chimpanzees. These datasets were subsequently processed using a dedicated fiber clustering pipeline adapted to the chimpanzee brain enabling us to create two novel deep and superficial white matter connectivity atlases representative of the chimpanzee brain. These atlases provide the scientific community with an important and novel set of reference data for understanding the commonalities and differ-ences of the structural connectivity between the human and chimpanzee brains, which will contribute to a better understanding of the hominin brain evolution.",

    "abstract": "Complete movement arrest has recently been reported to be induced in rodents by optogenetic stimulation of a subpopulation within the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN). This evoked arrest appears conspicuously similar to freezing behavior often seen as a fear response in prey animals but could also be akin to the freezing of gait, which is a symptom of Parkinsons disease. This introduces two perspectives on the functional roles of this sub-region: A hub for orchestrating fear-related responses or an omnipotent halting mechanism devoid of emotional components. To better understand this phenomenon and its cognitive component, we engage the distinct electrical brain activity, the hippocampal theta rhythm. This rhythm has a well-described contextual association between various aspects of cognition and behavior. It is prominent during locomotor activity in rodents and immobile yet aroused states like behavioral freezing. We recorded the electrical activity in the hippocampus of rats while walking and being arrested by PPN stimulation. A clear obstruction of the ongoing theta activity was associated with the motor arrest. The timescale of movement arrest was less than 200 ms, similar to the obstruction of the theta rhythm. Since, anxiety, fear, and behavioral freezing are associated with hippocampal theta rhythm, which we did not see during PPN stimulation, we suggest the induced motor arrest occurs without an associated emotional component.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe aggregation and spread of misfolded amyloid structured proteins, such as tau and -synuclein, are key pathological features associated with neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease. These proteins possess a prion-like property, enabling their transmission from cell to cell leading to propagation throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. While the mechanisms underlying their intracellular spread are still being elucidated, targeting the extracellular space has emerged as a potential therapeutic approach. The glymphatic system, a brain-wide pathway responsible for clearing extracellular metabolic waste from the central nervous system, has gained attention as a promising target for removing these toxic proteins.\n\nMethodsIn this study, we investigated the impact of long-term modulation of glymphatic function on tau aggregation and spread by chronically treating a mouse model of tau propagation with a pharmacological inhibitor of AQP4, TGN-020. Thy1-hTau.P301S mice were intracerebrally inoculated with tau into the hippocampus and overlying cortex, and subsequently treated with TGN-020 (3 doses/week, 50mg/kg TGN-020, i.p.) for 10-weeks. During this time, animal memory was studied using cognitive behavioural tasks, and structural MR images were acquired of the brain in vivo prior to brain extraction for immunohistochemical characterisation.\n\nResultsOur findings demonstrate increased tau aggregation in the brain and transhemispheric propagation in the hippocampus and cortex following the inhibition of glymphatic clearance. Moreover, disruption of the glymphatic system aggravated recognition memory in tau inoculated mice and exacerbated regional changes in brain volume detected in the model. When initiation of drug treatment was delayed for several weeks post-inoculation, the aforementioned alterations were attenuated.\n\nConclusionsThese results indicate that by modulating AQP4 function and, consequently, glymphatic clearance, it is possible to modify the propagation and pathological impact of tau in the brain, particularly during the initial stages of the disease. These findings highlight the critical role of the glymphatic system in preserving healthy brain homeostasis and offer valuable insights into the therapeutic implications of targeting this system for managing neurodegenerative diseases characterized by protein aggregation and spread.",

Viral vectored Env TTT induced similar neutralization titers but with a higher proportion of trimer-specific responses.

    "abstract": "Successful tissue homeostasis depends on a balance between proliferation and differentiation. Two PUF proteins, FBF-1 and FBF-2, maintain stem-cells proliferation in C. elegans germ-cells by binding and destabilizing transcripts which promote meiotic entry. However, it is unclear how meiosis initiates because the FBF are also present at significant levels in late proliferative and early meiotic cells. We found that the three long-intergenic-non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) that bind the FBF proteins promote timely meiotic entry. Deletion of the lincRNA genes leads to additive reduction in progenitor cell number and fertility. In the lincRNAs deletion mutant, expression of many known FBF-2 targets is significantly lower, suggesting over-activation of FBF-2. In this mutant, FBF-2 localization in perinuclear condensates is reduced, and its cytoplasmic fraction increases. Moreover, FBF-2 association with the germline P-granules decreases without the lincRNAs. Our results indicate that lincRNAs act to promote meiotic differentiation by spatially restricting pro-proliferation factors into phase-separated granules.",

    "abstract": "Early-life factors, including nutrition, shape long-term health outcomes. Despite the essential role of lactation in maternal nutritional support, the influence of epigenetic factors on lactation and postnatal growth remains poorly understood. Zinc-finger protein 57 (ZFP57), is an epigenetic regulator of genomic imprinting, a process that directs gene expression based on parental origin, playing a vital role in mammalian prenatal growth.\n\nHere, we identify a novel function of ZFP57 in regulating the mammary gland, where it serves as a key modulator of postnatal resource control, independently of imprinted genes. ZFP57 influences multiple aspects of mammary gland function, including ductal branching and cellular homeostasis. Its absence leads to significant differential gene expression, related to alveologenesis, lactogenesis and milk synthesis, associated with delayed lactation and altered milk composition. This results in life-long impacts on offspring including the development of metabolic syndrome.\n\nCross-fostering reveals intricate dynamics between mother and offspring during lactation. Pups raised by a dam of a different genotype than their birth mother exhibit exacerbated metabolic features in adulthood, providing additional insight into the programming of offspring long-term health by maternal context. This study deepens our understanding of the interplay between epigenetic factors, lactation, and postnatal resource control and identifies ZFP57 as a major regulator of both pre and postnatal resource control in mammals.",

    "abstract": "Despite great progress in understanding lipoprotein physiology, there is still much to be learned about the genetic drivers of lipoprotein abundance, composition, and function. We used ion mobility spectrometry to survey 16 plasma lipoprotein subfractions in 500 Diversity Outbred (DO) mice maintained on a Western-style diet. We identified 21 quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting lipoprotein abundance. To refine the QTL and link them to disease risk in humans, we asked if the human homologues of genes located at each QTL were associated with lipid traits in human genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Integration of mouse QTL with human GWAS yielded candidate gene drivers for 18 of the 21 QTL. This approach enabled us to nominate the gene encoding the neutral ceramidase, Asah2, as a novel candidate driver at a QTL on chromosome 19 for large HDL particles (HDL-2b). To experimentally validate Asah2, we surveyed lipoproteins in Asah2-/-mice. Compared to wild-type mice, female Asah2-/- mice showed an increase in several lipoproteins, including HDL. Our results provide insights into the genetic regulation of circulating lipoproteins, as well as mechanisms by which lipoprotein subfractions may affect cardiovascular disease risk in humans.",

    "abstract": "The cGAS/STING pathway triggers inflammation in response to diverse cellular stresses such as infection, cellular damage, senescence, normal aging, and age-related disease. Besides inflammation, STING also triggers non-canonical autophagy and cell death, the former of which requires the proton pump V-ATPase- mediated LC3 lipidation to single membrane STING vesicles. V-ATPase is known to sense organelle de- acidification in other contexts and recruits the ATG16L1 complex for direct conjugation of LC3/ATG8 to single membranes (CASM). However, it is unclear how STING activates V-ATPase for non-canonical autophagy. Here we report that upon STING activation, the transmembrane domain (TMD) of STING significantly reorganizes and forms an electron-sparse pore in the center. Cellular imaging and in vitro ion flux assays revealed that STING is critical for proton efflux and pH neutralization of Golgi-derived STING vesicles. A chemical ligand of STING, C53, which binds to and blocks the channel of STING strongly inhibited STING-mediated proton flux in vitro and vesicular de-acidification in cells. C53 also abolished STING-dependent LC3 lipidation and cell death. Thus, the ion channel function of STING activates non-canonical autophagy and cell death through vesicle de-acidification.",

We demonstrate that purified CLIC5 directly interacts with the membrane and induces fusion, as reflected by increased liposomal diameter and lipid and content mixing between liposomes. Moreover, we show that this activity is facilitated by acidic pH, a known trigger for CLICs transition to a membrane-associated conformation, and that increased exposure of the hydrophobic inter-domain interface is crucial for this process. Finally, mutation of a conserved hydrophobic interfacial residue diminishes the fusogenic activity of CLIC5 in vitro and impairs excretory canal extension in C. elegans in vivo.

    "abstract": "Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is currently the gold standard technique for large-scale genome and transcriptome studies. However, the downstream processing of NGS data is a critical bottleneck that requires difficult decisions regarding data analysis methods and parameters. Simulated or synthetic NGS datasets are practical and cost-effective alternatives for overcoming these difficulties. Simulated NGS datasets have known true values and provide a standardized scenario for driving the development of data analysis methodologies and tuning cut-off values. Although tools for simulating NGS data are available, they have limitations in terms of their overall usability and documentation. Here, we present Sandy, an open-source simulator that generates synthetic reads that mimic DNA or RNA next-generation sequencing on the Illumina, Oxford Nanopore, and Pacific Bioscience platforms. Sandy is designed to be user-friendly, computationally efficient, and capable of simulating data resembling a wide range of features of real NGS assays, including sequencing quality, genomic variations, and gene expression profiles per tissue. To demonstrate Sandys versatility, we used it to address two critical questions in designing an NGS assay: (i) How many reads should be sequenced to ensure unbiased analysis of gene expression in an RNA sequencing run? (ii) What is the lowest genome coverage required to identify most (90%) of the single nucleotide variants and structural variations in whole-genome sequencing? In summary, Sandy is an ideal tool for assessing and validating pipelines for processing, optimizing results, and defining the costs of NGS assays. Sandy runs on Linux, MacOS, and Microsoft Windows and can provide feasible results, even on personal computers. Availability: Sandy is freely available at https://galantelab.github.io/sandy.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveWhile multiple factors influence coronary artery bypass graft success rates, preserving saphenous vein endothelium during surgery may improve patency. Standard methods of saphenous vein graft preparation in heparinized saline (saline) solutions result in endothelial loss and damage. Here we investigated the impact of preparing saphenous graft vessels in heparinized patient blood (blood) vs saline on cellular health and survival.\n\nMethodsSaphenous vein tissues from a total of 23 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery were split into 2 treatment groups, 1) standard preparation using saline and 2) preparation using blood. Immediately following surgery, excess tissue was fixed for analysis. Level of endothelial coverage, oxidative stress marker 4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE), and oxidative stress protective marker nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) expression were evaluated.\n\nResultsIn saline patient veins, histological analysis revealed a broken or absent luminal layer, suggesting a loss of endothelial cell (EC) coverage. Luminal cell coverage was notably preserved in blood-treated samples. Immunofluorescent staining of endothelial markers vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) and endothelial nitric oxide (eNOS) identified a significant improvement in endothelial coverage in the blood group compared to saline. Although in both treatment groups EC expressed 4HNE indicating a similar level of oxidative stress, EC stored in blood solutions expressed higher levels of the protective transcription NRF2.\n\nConclusionsOur data indicate that maintaining and preparing saphenous vein tissues in solutions containing heparinized blood helps preserve the endothelium and promotes vein graft health. This has the potential to improve long-term outcomes in patients.\n\nCentral MessageDuring coronary artery bypass grafting, preparation of saphenous veins with heparinized saline damages the endothelium and increases oxidative stress. Heparinized blood preparation limits this endothelial loss and damage.\n\nPerspectives StatementSaphenous vein grafts are prone to failure through neointimal hyperplasia or thrombosis. Endothelial damage and loss are thought to be major contributing factors to graft failure. Here we find that preparation and preservation of saphenous vein grafts with patients own heparinized blood is sufficient to ensure endothelial preservation and protect vessels from oxidative stress compared with heparinized saline. These changes may increase long-term graft patency rates.",

In total, 69 SNPs scattered over all 17 apple chromosomes were significantly associated with round, conical, cylindrical, or symmetric fruit shapes and fruit size. Novel associations with major effect on round or conical fruit shapes and fruit size were identified on chromosomes 1 and 2.

    "abstract": "Plant organs move throughout the diurnal cycle, changing leaf and petiole positions to balance light capture, leaf temperature and water loss under dynamic environmental conditions. Upward movement of the petiole, called hyponasty, is one of several traits of the shade avoidance syndrome (SAS). SAS traits are elicited upon perception of vegetation shade signals such as far-red light (FR) and improve light capture in dense vegetation. Monitoring plant movement at a high temporal resolution allows studying functionality, as well as molecular regulation of hyponasty. However, high temporal resolution imaging solutions are often very expensive, making this unavailable to many researchers. Here, we present a modular and low-cost imaging set-up, based on small Raspberry Pi computers, that can track leaf movements and elongation growth with high temporal resolution. We also developed an open-source, semi-automated image analysis pipeline. Using this setup we followed responses to FR enrichment, light intensity and their interactions. Tracking both elongation and angle of petiole, lamina and entire leaf revealed insight into R:FR sensitivities of leaf growth and movement dynamics, and its interactions with background light intensity. We also identified spatial separation in hyponastic response regulation for the petiole and the lamina of the leaf, depending on the light conditions.",

    "abstract": "Collagens are structural proteins that are predominantly found in the extracellular matrix, where they are mainly responsible for the stability and structural integrity of various tissues. There are several different types of collagens, some of which differ significantly in form, function, and tissue specificity. Subdivisions into so-called collagen families exist, which are defined on the basis of mainly clinical research. Collagens contain polypeptide strands ([a]-chains). Their sequences are often analysed in view of clinical aspects, but problems arise with highly homologous sequence segments. To increase the accuracy of collagen classification and prediction of their functions, the structure of these collagens and their expression in different tissues could result in a better focus on sequence segments of interest. Here, we analyse collagen families with different levels of conservation. As a result, families with strong interchain hydrogen bonds can be found, such as fibrillar collagens, network-forming collagens, and FACITs. Moreover, collagen IV -chains form their own cluster, and other collagen -chains do not bond at all.",

    "abstract": "Genome-scale metabolic models are powerful tools for understanding cellular physiology. Flux balance analysis (FBA), in particular, is a popular optimization approach for predicting metabolic phenotypes under genetic and environmental perturbations. In model microbes such as Escherichia coli, FBA has been successful at predicting essential genes, i.e. those genes that impair survival when deleted. A central assumption in this approach, however, is that both wild type and deletion strains optimize the same fitness objective. While the optimality assumption may hold for the wild type metabolic network, deletion strains are not subject to the same evolutionary pressures and knock-out mutants may steer their metabolism to meet other objectives for survival. Here, we present FlowGAT, a hybrid FBA-machine learning strategy for predicting essentiality directly from wild type metabolic phenotypes. The approach is based on graph-structured representation of metabolic fluxes predicted by FBA, where nodes correspond to enzymatic reactions and edges quantify the propagation of metabolite mass flow between a reaction and its neighbours. We integrate this information into a graph neural network that can be trained on knock-out fitness assay data. Comparisons across different model architectures reveal that FlowGAT predictions for E. coli are close to those of FBA for several growth conditions. This suggests that gene essentiality can be accurately predicted by exploiting the network structure of metabolism, without additional assumptions beyond optimality of the wild type. Our approach demonstrates the benefits of combining the mechanistic insights afforded by genome-scale models with the ability of deep learning models to extract patterns from complex data.",

    "abstract": "1.Early detection of invasive species is crucial for effective control of the potential damage they can inflict on the ecosystems. In contrast to the many limitations that traditional detection methods like visual surveys and netting hold, the use of environmental DNA assay provides a powerful alternative. This non-invasive, highly sensitive, and user-friendly technique offers the advantage of detecting invasive species even in areas where direct observation is challenging, thus addressing the shortcomings of traditional techniques and enhancing overall accuracy in estimating distribution. The spread of invasive Pterygoplichthys sp. has become a cause for concern in biodiversity-rich countries like India. Despite this, comprehensive studies on the prevalence of this invasive species are limited. The Eastern Ghats of India remain underexplored with a high potential for supporting diverse lifeforms. Studying the extent of biological invasions in the Eastern Ghats is very essential for effective conservation management to mitigate the ecological and socioeconomic impacts of invasive species. In this study, we have designed and optimised an eDNA-based quantitative PCR assay to map the presence and spread of invasive Pterygoplichthys sp. in selected freshwater ecosystems of the Eastern Ghats. With this assay, we detected invasive Pterygoplichthys sp in almost 65% of the total locations sampled. This study can be further extended to larger geographical areas, which in turn can contribute in formulating necessary measures by the authorities to manage invasion and conserve the diversity of the freshwater ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Macaques trained to perform bipedally used running gaits across a wide range of speed. At higher speeds they preferred unilateral skipping (galloping). The same asymmetric stepping pattern was used while hurdling across two low obstacles placed at the distance of a stride within our experimental track. In bipedal macaques during skipping, we expected a differential use of the trailing and leading legs. The present study investigated global properties of the effective and virtual leg, the location of the virtual pivot point (VPP), and the energetics of the center of mass (CoM), with the aim of clarifying the differential leg operation during skipping in bipedal macaques. Macaques skipping displayed minor double support and aerial phases during one stride. Asymmetric leg use indicated by differences in leg kinematics. Axial damping and tangential leg work did not influence the indifferent peak ground reaction forces and impulses, but resulted in a lift of the CoM during contact of the leading leg. The aerial phase was largely due to the use of the double support. Hurdling amplified the differences. Here, higher ground reaction forces combined with increased double support provided the vertical impulse to overcome the hurdles. Following CoM dynamics during a stride skipping and hurdling represented bouncing gaits. The elevation of the VPP of bipedal macaques resembled that of human walking and running in the trailing and leading phases, respectively. Due to anatomical restrictions, macaque unilateral skipping differs from that of humans, and may represent an intermediate gait between grounded and aerial running.",

    "abstract": "Vesicular transport plays critical roles in photopigment delivery at photoreceptor outer segments and glutamate exocytosis at photoreceptor synapses. Previous studies into the role of photoreceptor SNAP proteins are limited in their characterizations into only gene/protein expression and do not delve further into their functional role. Here, we examine the expression and localization of SNAP-23 and SNAP-25 mRNA and protein. Using SNAP-23 and SNAP-25 conditional knockout mice, we further evaluated the morphological and functional consequences that the absence of these proteins has on vision. Although we found that the ubiquitously expressed SNAP-23 showed weak mRNA expression in photoreceptors, removal of SNAP-23 did not result in any observable phenotype. We found that neuronal SNAP-25 is developmentally regulated and SNAP-25 mRNA undergoes mRNA trafficking to the photoreceptor inner segments coinciding with the development of photoreceptor outer segments. Removal of SNAP-25 in photoreceptor cells led to changes in both outer segment protein trafficking and synaptic integrity, resulting in a complete loss of vision in SNAP-25 cKO mice. Our results conclude that SNAP-25, but not SNAP-23, is the essential isoform for photoreceptor survival and function.",

    "abstract": "O_LILeaf mould, caused by Fulvia fulva, is a devastating disease of tomato plants. In many commercial tomato cultivars, resistance to this disease is governed by the Cf-9 locus, which comprises five paralogous genes (Cf-9A-9E) that encode receptor-like proteins. Two of these proteins contribute to resistance: Cf-9C recognizes the previously identified F. fulva effector Avr9 and provides resistance during all plant growth stages, while Cf-9B recognises the yet-unidentified F. fulva effector Avr9B and provides mature plant resistance only. In recent years, F. fulva strains have emerged that have overcome the Cf-9 locus, with Cf-9C circumvented through Avr9 deletion. To understand how Cf-9B is circumvented, we set out to identify Avr9B.\nC_LIO_LIComparative genomics, in planta transient expression assays and gene complementation experiments were used to identify Avr9B, while gene sequencing was used to assess Avr9B allelic variation across a worldwide strain collection.\nC_LIO_LIA strict correlation between Avr9 deletion and resistance-breaking mutations in Avr9B was observed in strains recently collected from Cf-9 cultivars, whereas Avr9 deletion but no mutations in Avr9B were observed in older strains.\nC_LIO_LIThis research showcases how F. fulva has evolved to sequentially break down the two functional resistance genes of the complex Cf-9 locus and highlights that this locus now has limited value for controlling leaf mould disease in worldwide commercial tomato production.\nC_LI",
