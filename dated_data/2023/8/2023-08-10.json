    "abstract": "To establish the relationship between the glymphatic system of the brain and the circadian rhythm, we analyzed the effect of anomalies in water thermodynamics on the dependence of the dynamic, electrical, and optical characteristics of physiological fluids on temperature. The dynamics of hydrogen bonds in bulk and hydrated water affected the activation energies of ion currents of voltage-dependent channels that regulate signaling and trophic bonds in the neuropil of the cortical parenchyma. The physics of minimizing the of the isobaric heat capacity of water made it possible to explain the stabilization and functional optimization of the thermodynamics of eyeball fluids at 34.5 {degrees}C and the human brain during sleep at 36.5 {degrees}C. At these temperatures, the thermoreceptors of the cornea and the cells of the ganglionic layer of the retina, through connections with the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the pineal gland, switch the circadian rhythm from daytime to nighttime. The phylogenesis of the circadian rhythm was reflected in the dependence of the duration of the nighttime sleep of mammals on the diameter of the eyeball and the mass of the pineal gland. The activity of all the nerves of the eyeball led to the division of the nocturnal brain metabolism into NREM and REM phases. These phases correspond to two modes of the glymphatic system electrochemical and dynamic. The first is responsible for the relaxation processes of synaptic plasticity and chemical neutralization of toxins with the participation of water and melatonin. Rapid eye movement and an increase in cerebral blood flow in the second mode increase water exchange in the parenchyma and flush out toxins into the venous system. Electrophysics of clearance and conductivity of ionic and water channels of membranes of blood vessels and astrocytes modulate oscillations of polarization potentials of water dipole domains in parietal plasma layers of arterioles and capillaries.",

    "abstract": "PurposeThe bad bitter taste of some medicines is a barrier to overcoming non-compliance with medication use, especially life-saving drugs given to children and the elderly. Here we evaluated a new class of bitter blockers (thiazolidinediones; TZDs).\n\nMethodsIn this study, two TZDs were tested, rosiglitazone (ROSI) and a simpler form of TZD, using a high-potency sweetener as a positive control (neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, NHDC). We tested bitter-blocking effects using the bitter drugs tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF), a treatment for HIV and hepatitis B infection, and praziquantel (PRAZ), a treatment for schistosomiasis, by conducting taste testing with two separate taste panels: a general panel (N=97, 20-23 yrs, 82.5% female, all Eastern European) and a genetically informative panel (N=158, including 68 twin pairs, 18-82 yrs, 76% female, 87% European ancestry). Participants rated the bitterness intensity of the solutions on a 100-point generalized visual analog scale.\n\nFindingsParticipants in both taste panels rated the bitter drugs TAF and PRAZ as less bitter on average when mixed with NHDC than when sampled alone. ROSI partially suppressed the bitterness of TAF and PRAZ, but effectiveness differed between the two panels: bitterness was significantly reduced for PRAZ but not TAF in the general panel and for TAF but not PRAZ in the genetically informative panel. ROSI was a more effective blocker than the other TZD.\n\nImplicationsThese results suggest that TZDs are partially effective bitter blockers, suggesting other TZDs should be designed and tested with more drugs and on diverse populations to define which ones work best with which drugs and for whom. The discovery of bitter receptor blockers can improve compliance with medication use.",

    "abstract": "Glycine receptors (GlyRs) are members of the Cys-loop receptors that constitute a major portion of neurotransmitter receptors in the human nervous system. GlyRs are found in the spinal cord and brain mediating locomotive, sensory and cognitive functions, and are targets for pharmaceutical development. GlyRs share a general gating scheme with Cys-loop receptor family members, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. Recent resolution of heteromeric GlyRs structures in multiple functional states identified an invariable 4:1 :{beta} subunit stoichiometry and provided snapshots in the gating cycle, challenging previous beliefs and raising the fundamental questions of how  and {beta} subunit functions in glycine binding and channel activation. In addition, how a single glycine-bound extracellular domain conformation leads to structurally and functionally different open and desensitized states remained enigmatic. In this study, we characterized in detail equilibrium properties as well as the transition kinetics between functional states. We show that while all allosteric sites bind cooperatively to glycine, occupation of 2 sites at the - interfaces is necessary and sufficient for GlyR activation. We also demonstrate differential glycine concentration dependence of desensitization rate, extent, and its recovery, which suggests separate but concerted roles of ligand-binding and ionophore reorganization. Based on these observations and available structural information, we developed a comprehensive quantitative gating model that accurately predicts both equilibrium and kinetical properties throughout glycine gating cycle. This model likely applies generally to the Cys-loop receptor family and informs on pharmaceutical endeavors in function modulation of this receptor family.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium is an obligate intracellular parasite that makes numerous interactions with different hosts during its elaborate life cycle. This is also the case for other parasites that belong to the same phylum Apicomplexa. In this study, we identified bioinformatically the components of the multi-synthetase complexes (MSC) of several Apicomplexa parasites. By using AlphaFold2 modeling to compare their assembly, it appears that none of these MSCs resemble those identified in Plasmodium. In particular, the discrepancies between the core components of Plasmodium complexes, tRip and its homologs indicate that tRip-dependent exogenous tRNA import is not conserved in the other Apicomplexa parasites. Based on this observation, we looked for obvious differences that could explain this singularity in Plasmodium. The content of tRNA genes and amino acid usage in the different genomes highlighted the originality of Plasmodia translation. This is evident with respect to asparagine amino acid, which is highly used in the Plasmodium proteomes, and the scarcity of tRNAAsn required for protein synthesis, regardless of long homorepeats or AT content of the genomes.",

    "abstract": "Life on Earth relies on carbon and nitrogen assimilation by RubisCO and GS-GOGAT enzymes, respectively, whose activities depend on a constant supply of inorganic carbon (Ci) and nitrogen (N). Members of the PII signal transduction superfamily are among the most ancient and widespread cell signaling proteins in nature. One of their most highly conserved functions is controlling Ci- and N-transporters, a feature found in different phyla of the Archaea and in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Recently, we identified the PII-like protein SbtB as Ci-sensing module, mainly controlling the HCO3- transporter SbtA in cyanobacteria. Similar to canonical PII proteins, SbtB is able to bind the adenine nucleotides ATP and ADP. Unlike those, it also binds AMP and preferentially binds the second messenger cAMP and c-di-AMP. The functional significance of the binding of different adenyl-nucleotides to SbtB has remained elusive, particularly in the context of the interaction of SbtB with SbtA. By a combination of structural, biochemical and physiological analysis, we revealed that by binding to SbtA, SbtB acts as unidirectional valve, preventing the reverse transport of intracellular enriched bicarbonate. This mechanistic principle holds true for the PII protein from Bacillus acting on the ammonium transporter AmtB, suggesting an evolutionary conserved role for PII superfamily proteins in controlling unidirectional flow of different transporters.",

    "abstract": "The Dong Taijinar Salt Lake (DT) and Xi Taijinar Salt Lake (XT) have been widely studied as mineral-rich areas. However, little is known about the composition and distribution of the microbial communities in these two lakes. In this study, metagenomics sequencing was used to analyze the diversity and potential functions of the microbial communities in DT and XT. According to our report, the salinity of DT (332.18-358.30 g/L) was 10 times higher than that of XT (20.09-36.83 g/L). Interestingly, the dominant domain in DT was Archaea (96.16%), while that in XT was Bacteria (93.09%). The distribution of Bacteria in the DT revealed 33 phyla and 1717 genera. The dominant genus in DT was Marinobacillus, which was positively correlated with total phosphorus content. There were four main phyla and 153 genera identified in the Archaea of DT. The most abundant Archaea genera in DT were Natronomonas (24.61%) and Halorubrum (23.69%), which were mainly positively correlated with the Na+, Ca2+, and Cl- contents. Similarly, there were 33 phyla and 1906 genera of Bacteria in XT, and Loktanella was the dominant genus. The archaeal taxonomy in XT mainly included four phyla and 149 genera. Proteobacteria and Euryarchaeota were the most abundant bacterial and archaeal phyla in the two salt lakes. Analysis of the halophilic mechanisms of the microorganisms identified in these two salt lakes revealed that the Bacteria in XT preferred to synthesize compatible solutes, whereas the Archaea in DT preferred a \"salt-in\" adaptation strategy in salt-stressed environments.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is the origin of many lakes and mountains in China. Among them, the Dong Taijinar and Xi Taijinar salt lakes are important biological resources with unknown microbial community compositions and functional potentials. The results of this study revealed significant differences in the distribution of Bacteria and Archaea between the two salt lakes. Salinity mainly drives lower biodiversity and restricted bacterial growth and metabolism in the high-salinity and near-saturated Dong Taijinar Salt Lake. This study not only identifies the key microorganisms in two penetrating salt lakes, but also provides insights into the mechanisms of salinity tolerance and the unknown ecological functions of microorganisms in extreme environments.",

    "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii, the causative agent of toxoplasmosis, is an obligate intracellular parasite that infects warm-blooded vertebrates across the world. In humans, seropositivity rates of T. gondii range from 10% to 90%. Despite its prevalence, few studies address how T. gondii infection changes the metabolism of host cells. Here, we investigate how T. gondii manipulates the host cell metabolic environment by monitoring metabolic response over time using non-invasive autofluorescence lifetime imaging of single cells, seahorse metabolic flux analysis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and metabolomics. Autofluorescence lifetime imaging indicates that infected host cells become more oxidized and have an increased proportion of bound NAD(P)H with infection. These findings are consistent with changes in mitochondrial and glycolytic function, decrease of intracellular glucose, fluctuations in lactate and ROS production in infected cells over time. We also examined changes associated with the pre-invasion \"kiss and spit\" process using autofluorescence lifetime imaging, which similarly showed a more oxidized host cell with an increased proportion of bound NAD(P)H over 48 hours. Glucose metabolic flux analysis indicated that these changes are driven by NADH and NADP+ in T. gondii infection. In sum, metabolic changes in host cells with T. gondii infection were similar during full infection, and kiss and spit. Autofluorescence lifetime imaging can non-invasively monitor metabolic changes in host cells over a microbial infection time-course.",

Here, we report the structure of a Thermococcus kodakarensis transcription pre-termination complex comprising FttA, Spt4, Spt5, and a transcription elongation complex (TEC). The structure shows that FttA interacts with the TEC in a manner that enables RNA to proceed directly from the TEC RNA-exit channel to the FttA catalytic center and that enables endonucleolytic cleavage of RNA by FttA, followed by 5[-&gt;]3 exonucleolytic cleavage of RNA by FttA and concomitant 5[-&gt;]3 translocation of FttA on RNA, to apply mechanical force to the TEC and trigger termination. The structure further reveals that Spt5 bridges FttA and the TEC, explaining how Spt5 stimulates FttA-dependent termination. The results reveal functional analogy between bacterial and archaeal factor-dependent termination, reveal functional homology between archaeal and eukaryotic factor-dependent termination, and reveal fundamental mechanistic similarities in factor-dependent termination in the three domains of life: bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic.\n\nOne sentence summaryCryo-EM reveals the structure of the archaeal FttA pre-termination complex",

    "abstract": "Identification of B-cell epitopes facilitates the development of vaccines, therapeutic antibodies and diagnostic tools. Previously, the binding site of the bank vole monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4G2 against Puumala virus (PUUV, an orthohantavirus in the Hantaviridae family of the Bunyavirales order) was predicted using a combination of methods, including pepscan, phage-display, and site-directed mutagenesis of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) particles pseudotyped with Gn and Gc glycoproteins from PUUV. These techniques led to the identification of the neutralization escape mutation F915A. To our surprise, a recent crystal structure of PUUV Gc in complex with Fab 4G2 revealed that residue F915 is distal from epitope of mAb 4G2. To clarify this issue and explore potential explanations for the inconsistency, we designed a mutagenesis experiment to probe the 4G2 epitope, with three PUUV pseudoviruses carrying amino acid changes E725A, S944F, and S946F, located within the structure-based 4G2 epitope in the Gc. These amino acid changes were able to convey neutralization escape from 4G2, and S944F and S946F also conveyed escape from neutralization by human mAb 1C9. Furthemore, our mapping of all the known neutralization evasion sites from hantaviral Gcs onto PUUV Gc revealed that over 60% of these sites reside within or close to the epitope of mAb 4G2, indicating that this region represents a crucial area targeted by neutralizing antibodies against various hantaviruses. The identification of this site of vulnerability could guide the creation of subunit vaccines against PUUV and other hantaviruses in the future.",

    "abstract": "The human cerebral cortex is populated by specialized regions that are organized into networks. Here we estimated networks using a Multi-Session Hierarchical Bayesian sModel (MS-HBM) applied to intensively sampled within-individual functional MRI (fMRI) data. The network estimation procedure was initially developed and tested in two participants (each scanned 31 times) and then prospectively applied to 15 new participants (each scanned 8 to 11 times). Detailed analysis of the networks revealed a global organization. Locally organized first-order sensory and motor networks were surrounded by spatially adjacent second-order networks that also linked to distant regions. Third-order networks each possessed regions distributed widely throughout association cortex. Moreover, regions of distinct third-order networks displayed side-by-side juxtapositions with a pattern that repeated similarly across multiple cortical zones. We refer to these as Supra-Areal Association Megaclusters (SAAMs). Within each SAAM, two candidate control regions were typically adjacent to three separate domain-specialized regions. Independent task data were analyzed to explore functional response properties. The somatomotor and visual first-order networks responded to body movements and visual stimulation, respectively. A subset of the second-order networks responded to transients in an oddball detection task, consistent with a role in orienting to salient or novel events. The third-order networks, including distinct regions within each SAAM, showed two levels of functional specialization. Regions linked to candidate control networks responded to working memory load across multiple stimulus domains. The remaining regions within each SAAM did not track working memory load but rather dissociated across language, social, and spatial / episodic processing domains. These results support a model of the cerebral cortex in which progressively higher-order networks nest outwards from primary sensory and motor cortices. Within the apex zones of association cortex there is specialization of large-scale networks that divides domain-flexible from domain-specialized regions repeatedly across parietal, temporal, and prefrontal cortices. We discuss implications of these findings including how repeating organizational motifs may emerge during development.",

L1 is a large retrotransposon family expressed within CNS and suggested to contribute to its genomic plasticity.

We tested such prediction, in vivo as well as in engineered primary neural cultures, by loss- and gain-of-function approaches. We showed that Foxg1-dependent, transcriptional L1 repression specifically occurs in neopallial neuronogenic progenitors and post-mitotic neurons, where it is supported by specific changes in the L1 epigenetic landscape. Unexpectedly, we also found that Foxg1 physically interacts with L1-mRNA and positively impacts on neonatal neopallium L1-DNA content, antagonizing the retrotranscription-suppressing activity exerted by Mov10 and Ddx39a helicases. To our knowledge, Foxg1 is the first CNS patterning gene acting as a bimodal retrotransposon modulator, limiting and promoting L1 transcription and amplification, respectively, within a specific domain of the developing mouse brain.",

The Danio species examined showed largely similar skull shapes, although D. aesculapii, the sister species to D. rerio showed a unique morphology. Two non-Danio species examined, Chela dadiburjori and Devario aequipinnatus showed distinct skull morphologies unique from those of other species examined. Thyroid hormone regulates skeletal development and remodeling, and we asked if changes in developmental thyroid hormone metabolism could underlie some of the craniofacial diversity across Danioninae. We reared two Danio species under altered thyroid profiles, finding that hypothyroid individuals from both species showed corresponding morphological shifts in skull shape. Hypothyroid Danios showed skull morphologies closer to that of Chela and unlike any of the examined wild-type Danio species. We provide an examination of the evolved craniofacial diversity across Danioninae, and demonstrate that alterations to thyroid hormone have the capacity to create unique skull phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Societies in East Asia have utilized domesticated cattle for over 5000 years, but the genetic history of cattle in East Asia remains understudied. Genome-wide analyses of 23 ancient Mongolian cattle reveal that East Asian aurochs and ancient East Asian taurine cattle are closely related, but neither are closely related to any modern East Asian breeds. We observe binary variation in aurochs diet throughout the early Neolithic, and genomic evidence shows millennia of sustained male-dominated introgression. We identify a unique connection between ancient Mongolian aurochs and the European Hereford breed. These results point to the likelihood of human management of aurochs in Northeast Asia prior to and during the initial adoption of taurine cattle pastoralism.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryAncient interbreeding of East Asian aurochs and cattle suggests management, but leaves no signature in modern eastern breeds.",

    "abstract": "Integrator is a multi-subunits protein complex involved in regulation of gene expression. Several Integrator subunits have been found to be mutated in human neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting a key role for the complex in the development of nervous system. BRAT1 is similarly linked with neurodegenerative diseases and neurodevelopmental disorders such as rigidity and multifocal-seizure syndrome. Here, we show that INTS11 and INTS9 subunits of Integrator complex interact with BRAT1 and form a trimeric complex in human HEK293T cells as well as in pluripotent human embryonal carcinoma cell line (NT2). We find that BRAT1 depletion disrupts the differentiation of NT2 cells into astrocytes and neural cells. Loss of BRAT1 results in inability to activate many neuronal genes that are targets of REST, a neuronal silencer. We identified BRAT1 and INTS11 co-occupying the promoter region of these genes and pinpoint a role for BRAT1 in recruiting INTS11 to their promoters. Disease-causing mutations in BRAT1 diminish its association with INTS11/INTS9, linking the manifestation of disease phenotypes with a defect in transcriptional activation of key neuronal genes by BRAT1/INTS11/INTS9 complex.\n\nHighlightsO_LIIntegrator subunits INTS9 and INTS11 tightly interact with BRAT1\nC_LIO_LIDepletion of BRAT1 causes a dramatic delay in human neural differentiation\nC_LIO_LIBRAT1 and INTS11 module targets the promoters of neural marker genes and co-regulates their expression.

    "abstract": "Animals adapt to varying environmental conditions by modifying the function of their internal organs, including the brain. To be adaptive, alterations in behavior must be coordinated with the functional state of organs throughout the body. Here we find that thyroid hormone-- a prominent regulator of metabolism in many peripheral organs-- activates cell-type specific transcriptional programs in anterior regions of cortex of adult mice via direct activation of thyroid hormone receptors. These programs are enriched for axon-guidance genes in glutamatergic projection neurons, synaptic regulators across both astrocytes and neurons, and pro-myelination factors in oligodendrocytes, suggesting widespread remodeling of cortical circuits. Indeed, whole-cell electrophysiology recordings revealed that thyroid hormone induces local transcriptional programs that rewire cortical neural circuits via pre-synaptic mechanisms, resulting in increased excitatory drive with a concomitant sensitization of recruited inhibition. We find that thyroid hormone bidirectionally regulates innate exploratory behaviors and that the transcriptionally mediated circuit changes in anterior cortex causally promote exploratory decision-making. Thus, thyroid hormone acts directly on adult cerebral cortex to coordinate exploratory behaviors with whole-body metabolic state.",

    "abstract": "Autism manifests differently in males and females and the brain mechanisms that mediate these sex-dependent differences are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that deletion of the ASD-risk gene, Pten, in neocortical pyramidal neurons (NSEPten KO) results in robust hyperexcitability of local neocortical circuits in female, but not male, mice, observed as prolonged, spontaneous persistent activity states (UP states). Circuit hyperexcitability in females is mediated by enhanced signaling of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) and estrogen receptor  (ER) to ERK and de novo protein synthesis. In support of this idea, Pten deleted cortical neurons have a female-specific increase in mGluR5 levels and mGluR5-driven protein synthesis rates, mGluR5-ER complexes are elevated in female cortex and genetic reduction of ER in Pten KO cortical neurons rescues circuit excitability, protein synthesis rates and enhanced neuron size selectively in females. Abnormal timing and hyperexcitability of neocortical circuits in female NSEPten KO mice are associated with deficits in temporal processing of sensory stimuli and social behaviors as well as mGluR5-dependent seizures. Female-specific cortical hyperexcitability and mGluR5-dependent seizures are also observed in a human disease relevant mouse model, germline Pten+/-mice. Our results reveal molecular mechanisms by which sex and a high impact ASD-risk gene interact to affect brain function and behavior.",

    "abstract": "The developing brain has a well-organized anatomical structure comprising different types of neural and non-neural cells. Stem cells, progenitors, and newborn neurons tightly interact with their neighbouring cells and tissue microenvironment, and this intricate interplay ultimately shapes the output of neurogenesis. Given the relevance of spatial cues during brain development, we acknowledge the necessity for a spatial transcriptomics map accessible to the neurodevelopmental community. To fulfil this need, we generated spatially-resolved RNAseq data from E13.5 mouse brain sections immunostained for mitotic active neural and vascular cells. Unsupervised clustering defined specific cell type populations of diverse lineages and differentiation states. Differential expression analysis revealed unique transcriptional signatures across specific brain areas, uncovering novel features inherent to particular anatomical domains. Finally, we integrated existing single-cell RNAseq datasets into our Spatial Transcriptomics map, adding tissue context to single-cell RNAseq data. In summary, we provide a valuable tool that enables the exploration and discovery of unforeseen molecular players involved in neurogenesis, particularly in the crosstalk between different cell types.\n\nSummary StatementDi Marco, Vazquez-Marin et al. provide an open-access spatial transcriptomics atlas of the embryonic mouse brain. This spatial map enables the exploration and discovery of gene functions within tissue context.",
