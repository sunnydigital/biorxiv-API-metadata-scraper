    "abstract": "Oncogenic KRAS mutations are nearly ubiquitous in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), yet therapeutic attempts to target KRAS as well as its target MAPK pathway effectors have shown limited success due to the difficulty to pharmacologically target KRAS, inherent drug resistance in PDAC cells, and acquired resistance through activation of alternative mitogenic pathways such JAK-STAT and PI3K-AKT. While KRAS canonically drives the MAPK signaling pathway via RAF-MEK-ERK, it is also known to play a role in PI3K-AKT signaling. Our therapeutic study targeted the PI3K-AKT pathway with the drug Omipalisib (p110/{beta}/{delta}/{gamma} and mTORC1/2 inhibitor) in combination with MAPK pathway targeting drug Trametinib (MEK1/2 inhibitor) or SHP099-HCL (SHP099), which is an inhibitor of the KRAS effector SHP2. Western blot analysis demonstrated that application of Trametinib or SHP099 alone selectively blocked ERK phosphorylation (pERK) but failed to suppress phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) and in some instances increased pAKT levels. Conversely, Omipalisib alone successfully inhibited pAKT but failed to suppress pERK. Therefore, we hypothesized that a combination therapeutic comprised of Omipalisib with either Trametinib or SHP099 would inhibit two prominent mitogenic pathways, MEK and PI3K-AKT, to more effectively suppress pancreatic cancer. In vitro studies demonstrated that both Omipalisib/Trametinib and Omipalisib/SHP099 combination therapeutic strategies were generally more effective than treatment with each drug individually at reducing proliferation, colony formation, and cell migration compared to vehicle controls. Additionally, we found that while combination Omipalisib/SHP099 treatment reduced implanted tumor growth in vivo, the Omipalisib/Trametinib treatment was significantly more effective. Therefore, we additionally tested the Omipalisib/Trametinib combination therapeutic in the highly aggressive PKT (Ptf1acre, LSL-KrasG12D, TGFbR2fl/fl) spontaneous mouse model of PDAC. We subsequently found that PKT mice treated with the Omipalisib/Trametinib combination therapeutic survived significantly longer than mice treated with either drug alone, and more than doubled the mean survival time of vehicle control mice. Altogether, our data support the importance of a dual treatment strategy targeting both MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVEHereditary aortic diseases (hADs) increase the risk of aortic dissections and ruptures. Recently, we have established an objective approach to measure the rupture force of the murine aorta, thereby explaining the outcomes of clinical studies and assessing the added value of approved drugs in vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS). Here, we applied our approach to six additional mouse hAD models.\n\nAPPROACH AND RESULTWe used two mouse models of Marfan syndrome (MFS) as well as one smooth-muscle-cell-specific knockout (SMKO) of Efemp2 and three CRISPR/Cas9-engineered knock-in models (Ltbp1, Mfap4, and Timp1). Moreover, one of the two MFS models was subjected to 4-week-long losartan treatment. Per mouse, three rings of the thoracic aorta were prepared, mounted on a tissue puller, and uniaxially stretched until rupture. The aortic rupture force of the SMKO and both MFS models was significantly lower compared with wild-type mice but in both MFS models higher than in mice modeling vEDS. In contrast, the Ltbp1, Mfap4, and Timp1 knock-in models presented no impaired aortic integrity. As expected, losartan treatment reduced aneurysm formation but surprisingly had no impact on the aortic rupture force of our MFS mice.\n\nCONCLUSIONSWe demonstrate for the first time that our read-out system is able to characterize the aortic biomechanical integrity of mice modeling not only vEDS but also related hADs, allowing the aortic-rupture-force-focused comparison of mouse models. Furthermore, aneurysm progression alone may not be a sufficient read-out for aortic rupture, as blood-pressure-lowering therapies preventing aortic aneurysms might not strengthen the weakened aortic wall. These results may contribute to better medical therapies of hADs.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=138 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/553452v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b6db27org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ee09eaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cd22c0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a48af2_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIAssay to measure the aortic rupture force as read-out for the biomechanical integrity identified weakened murine thoracic aorta prior to micro- and macroscopic changes in Fbn1+/C1041Gmice.\nC_LIO_LIDespite reducing aneurysm growth, losartan treatment did not have any impact on the aortic rupture force of Fbn1mgR/mgR mice.\nC_LIO_LISmooth-muscle-cell-knock-out of Efemp2 significantly impaired the rupture force of the murine thoracic aorta.\nC_LIO_LIAortic rupture force measurements could clarify the causality of novel candidate gene(s)/variant(s) in mouse models of aortic diseases.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Colon cancer is commonly regarded as hormone-independent. However, there have been reports suggesting the involvement of sex hormones in colon cancer development. Nevertheless, the role of hormones from the hypothalamus-hypophysis axis in colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) remains uncertain. In this study, we observed a significant reduction in the expression of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) in colon samples from both colitis and CAC patients. To investigate further, we generated mice with an intestinal epithelium cell (IEC)-specific knockout of OXTR. These mice exhibited markedly increased susceptibility to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and DSS/Azoxymethane (AOM)-induced CAC compared to wild-type mice. Our findings indicate that OXTR depletion impaired the inner mucus of the colon epithelium. Mechanistically, oxytocin was found to regulate MUC2 maturation through B3GNT7-mediated fucosylation. Interestingly, we observed a positive correlation between B3GNT7 expression and OXTR expression in human colitis and CAC colon samples. Moreover, the administration of oxytocin significantly alleviated tumor burden. Hence, our study unveils oxytocins promising potential as an affordable and effective therapeutic intervention for individuals affected by colitis and CAC.",

    "abstract": "Soil salinity is a major environmental stressor affecting agricultural productivity worldwide. Understanding plant responses to salt stress is crucial for developing resilient crop varieties. Wild relatives of cultivated crops, such as wild tomato, Solanum pimpinellifolium, can serve as a useful resource to further expand the resilience potential of the cultivated germplasm, S. lycopersicum. In this study, we employed high-throughput phenotyping in the greenhouse and field conditions to explore salt stress responses of a S. pimpinellifolium diversity panel. Our study revealed extensive phenotypic variations in response to salt stress, with traits such as transpiration rate, shoot mass, and ion accumulation showing significant correlations with plant performance. We found that while transpiration was a key determinant of plant performance in the greenhouse, shoot mass strongly correlated with yield under field conditions. Conversely, ion accumulation was the least influential factor under greenhouse conditions. Through a Genome Wide Association Study, we identified candidate genes not previously associated with salt stress, highlighting the power of high-throughput phenotyping in uncovering novel aspects of plant stress responses. This study contributes to our understanding of salt stress tolerance in S. pimpinellifolium and lays the groundwork for further investigations into the genetic basis of these traits, ultimately informing breeding efforts for salinity tolerance in tomato and other crops.",

    "abstract": "Neurological conditions affecting the sensorimotor system have a profound impact on individuals physical independence and are associated with a considerable socioeconomic burden. Reliable functional biomarkers allowing early diagnosis of these conditions or targeting treatment and rehabilitation can reduce this burden. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) can non-invasively measure the brains salient rhythmic patterns such as the somatomotor ( rolandic) rhythm. This rhythm shows intermittent high amplitude  events in the beta (14-30 Hz) frequency range which predict behavior across tasks and species and are altered by neurological diseases affecting the sensorimotor system. Thus, the sensorimotor resting beta phenotype is a promising candidate biomarker of sensorimotor function. A prerequisite for use as a biomarker is that it can be quantified reliably across different measurement sessions. Here, using MEG, we assessed the test-retest stability of spontaneously occurring sensorimotor power spectral characteristics, including both aperiodic (1/f) as well as beta band fluctuations ( beta events) in a cohort of 50 healthy human controls. Test-retest reliability across two separate measurement sessions was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Beta events were determined using a thresholding-based approach on a narrow-band filtered amplitude envelope obtained using Morlet wavelet decomposition across a range of parameters (recording length, amplitude threshold and filtering bandwidth). We find that both aperiodic power spectral features as well as several beta event characteristics show good to excellent testretest stability. Especially aperiodic component power spectral features (ICC 0.77-0.88), but also measures of beta event amplitude (ICC 0.74-0.82) were found to be very stable, while measures of individual beta event duration were less reliable, especially for the left hemisphere (ICC right [~]0.7, left [~]0.55). Recordings of 2-3 minutes were sufficient to obtain stable results for most parameters. Important for potential clinical applications, automatization of beta event extraction was successful in 86 % of cases. Beta event rate and duration measures were more sensitive to analysis parameters than the measures of event amplitude. The results suggest the sensorimotor beta phenotype is a stable feature of an individuals resting brain activity even for short, 2-3 minute recordings which can be easily measured in patient populations, facilitating its use as a potential clinical biomarker.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental property of sensory systems is their ability to detect novel stimuli in the environment. The auditory brain contains neurons that decrease their response to repetitive sounds but that increase their firing rate to novel or deviant stimuli; the difference between both responses is known as stimulus-specific adaptation or neuronal mismatch (nMM). Here, we tested the effect of microiontophoretic applications of ACh on the neuronal responses in the auditory cortex (AC) of anesthetized rats during an auditory oddball paradigm, including cascade controls. Results indicate that ACh modulates the nMM, affecting prediction error responses but not repetition suppression, and this effect is manifest predominantly in infragranular cortical layers. The differential effect of ACh on responses to standards, relative to deviants (in terms of averages and variances), were consistent with the representational sharpening that accompanies an increase in the precision of prediction errors. These findings suggest that ACh plays an important role in modulating prediction error signaling in the AC and gating the access of these signals to higher cognitive levels.",

    "abstract": "Synchronous neural oscillations are strongly associated with a variety of perceptual, cognitive, and behavioural processes. It has been proposed that the role of the synchronous oscillations in these processes is to facilitate information transmission between brain areas, the  communication through coherence, or CTC hypothesis.The details of how this mechanism would work, however, and its causal status, are still unclear. Here we investigate computationally a proposed mechanism for selective attention that directly implicates the CTC as causal. The mechanism involves alpha band (about 10 Hz) oscillations, originating in the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus, being sent to communicating cortical areas, organizing gamma (about 40 Hz) oscillations there, and thus facilitating phase coherence and communication between them. This is proposed to happen contingent on control signals sent from higher-level cortical areas to the thalamic reticular nucleus, which controls the alpha oscillations sent to cortex by the pulvinar. We studied the scope of this mechanism in parameter space, and limitations implied by this scope, using a computational implementation of our conceptual model. Our results indicate that, although the CTC-based mechanism can account for some effects of top-down and bottom-up attentional selection, its limitations indicate that an alternative mechanism, in which oscillatory coherence is caused by communication between brain areas rather than being a causal factor for it, might operate in addition to, or even instead of, the CTC mechanism.\n\nAuthor summaryThe ability to select some stimulus or stimulus location from all of those available to our senses is critical to our ability to navigate our complex biological and social niche, and to organize appropriate actions to accomplish our goals, namely to survive and to reproduce. We study here a possible mechanism by which the brain could accomplish attentional selection. We show that the interaction between 10 Hz and 40 Hz neural oscillations can provide increases in coherence and information transmission between computationally modelled cortical areas. Our results support the idea that synchronization between oscillations facilitates communication between cortical areas. Limitations and sensitivities to the model, however, also point to the idea that the relation between coherence and communication could go in the opposite direction in some cases, particularly when attention is not involved.",

Application of scDOT to existing and new lung ST data improves on prior methods and allows the identification of the spatial organization of senescent cells, the identification of their neighboring cells and the identification of novel genes involved in cell-cell interactions that may be driving senescence.",

    "abstract": "Actin capping protein (CP) can be regulated by steric and allosteric mechanisms. The molecular mechanism of the allosteric regulation at a biophysical level includes linkage between the binding sites for three ligands: F-actin, Capping-Protein-Interacting (CPI) motifs, and V-1/myotrophin, based on biochemical functional studies and solvent accessibility experiments. Here, we investigated the mechanism of allosteric regulation at the atomic level using single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and molecular dynamics (MD) to assess the conformational and structural dynamics of CP in response to linked-binding site ligands. In the absence of ligand, both single-molecule FRET and MD revealed two distinct conformations of CP in solution; previous crystallographic studies revealed only one. CPI-motif peptide association induced conformational changes within CP that propagate in one direction, while V-1 association induced conformational changes in the opposite direction. Comparing CPI-motif peptides from different proteins, we identified variations in CP conformations and dynamics that are specific to each CPI motif. MD simulations for CP alone and in complex with a CPI motif and V-1 reveal atomistic details of the conformational changes. Analysis of the interaction of CP with wildtype (wt) and chimeric CPI-motif peptides using single-molecule FRET, isothermal calorimetry (ITC) and MD simulation indicated that conformational and affinity differences are intrinsic to the C-terminal portion of the CPI-motif. We conclude that allosteric regulation of CP involves changes in conformation that disseminate across the protein to link distinct binding-site functions. Our results provide novel insights into the biophysical mechanism of the allosteric regulation of CP.",

The other 12 encode components of the CDC45-MCM-GINS helicase, around which the eukaryotic replisome forms, or are factors required for helicase assembly during DNA replication initiation. A role for DONSON in CDC45-MCM-GINS assembly was unanticipated, since DNA replication initiation can be reconstituted in vitro with purified proteins from budding yeast, which lacks DONSON. Using mouse embryonic stem cells as a model for the mammalian helicase, we show that DONSON binds directly but transiently to CDC45-MCM-GINS during S-phase and is essential for chromosome duplication. Rapid depletion of DONSON leads to the disappearance of the CDC45-MCM-GINS helicase from S-phase cells and our data indicate that DONSON is dispensable for loading of the MCM2-7 helicase core onto chromatin during G1-phase, but instead is essential for CDC45-MCM-GINS assembly during S-phase.

Here we report that the CTDs of two closely related family C GPCRs, metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGluR2) and mGluR3, bind to membranes and that this interaction controls receptor function. We first characterize CTD structure with NMR spectroscopy, revealing lipid composition-dependent modes of membrane binding. Using molecular dynamics simulations and structure-guided mutagenesis, we identify key conserved residues and cancer-associated mutations that control CTD-membrane binding. Finally, we provide evidence that mGluR3 transducer coupling is controlled by CTD-membrane interactions in live cells which can be modulated by disease-associated mutations or CTD phosphorylation. This work reveals a novel mechanism of GPCR modulation, suggesting that CTD-membrane binding may be a general regulatory mode throughout the broad GPCR superfamily.\n\nSignificance StatementG protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) allow cells to sense and respond to their environment and constitute the largest class of targets for approved therapeutic drugs. Temporally precise GPCR signaling is achieved by coupling the binding of extracellular ligands to the binding of intracellular signal transducers (e.g. heterotrimeric G proteins) and regulators (e.g. {beta}-arrestins). The C-terminal domains (CTDs) of GPCRs are targets of various post-translational modifications and play a critical role in transducer and regulator recruitment. Here we report novel interactions of the CTDs of two GPCRs of the metabotropic glutamate receptor family with cellular membranes. These interactions serve to regulate CTD accessibility and thus, mGluR coupling to transducers and regulators. We propose that dynamic CTD-membrane interaction constitutes a general mechanism for regulating GPCR function.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasensitive transcriptional switches enable cells to make sharp transitions between on and off states of transcription, essential for cells to respond to environmental cues with high fidelity. However, conventional switches that rely on direct repressor-DNA binding are extremely sensitive to noise, leading to unintended changes in gene expression. This raises doubts about the effectiveness of these switches in noisy cellular environments. Here, we find an alternative avenue, where the combination of different indirect transcriptional regulations generates a noise-resilient ultrasensitive switch. Specifically, when a transcriptional repressor inhibits a transcriptional activator through the combination of sequestration, blocking, and displacement instead of directly binding to DNA, a robust ultrasensitive switch is achieved. Sequestration alone can generate an ultrasensitive transcriptional response, but the switch remains vulnerable to noise because the undesired on or off state induced by noise can persist for a long period. However, by jointly utilizing blocking and displacement, noise-induced transitions can be rapidly restored to the original desired state. This transcriptional switch is effective in noisy cellular contexts, which makes it suitable for robust synthetic system design. Our findings also provide insights into the evolution of ultrasensitive switches in real cells. The concurrent use of seemingly redundant multiple indirect transcriptional repression mechanisms in diverse biological systems appears to be a strategy to improve the noise-resilience of ultrasensitive switches.",

    "abstract": "Cisplatin (cis-Dichlorodiamineplatinum[II], CDDP) is generally accepted as a platinum-based alkylating agent type of the DNA-damaging anticancer drug, which is widely administrated in clinical treatment of many solid tumors. The pharmacological effect of CDDP is mainly achieved by replacing the chloride ion (Cl-) in its structure with H2O to form active substances with the strong electrophilic properties and then react with any nucleophilic molecules, primarily leading to genomic DNA damage and subsequent cell death. In this process, those target genes driven by the consensus electrophilic and/or antioxidant response elements (EpREs/AREs) in their promoter regions are also activated or repressed by CDDP. Thereby, we here examined the expression profiling of such genes regulated by two principal antioxidant transcription factors Nrf1 and Nrf2 (both encoded by Nfe2l1 and Nfe2l2, respectively) in diverse cellular signaling responses to this intervention. The results demonstrated distinct cellular metabolisms, molecular pathways and signaling response mechanisms by which Nrf1 and Nrf2 as the drug targets differentially contribute to the anticancer efficacy of CDDP on hepatoma cells and xenograft tumor mice. Interestingly, the role of Nrf1, rather than Nrf2, is required for the anticancer effect of CDDP, to suppress malignant behavior of HepG2 cells by differentially monitoring multi-hierarchical signaling to gene regulatory networks. To our surprise, it was found there exists a closer relationship of Nrf1 than Nrf2 with DNA repair, but the hyperactive Nrf2 in Nrf1-/-cells manifests a strong correlation with its resistance to CDDP, albeit their mechanistic details remain elusive.",

    "abstract": "Computer models of the human ventricular cardiomyocyte action potential (AP) have reached a level of detail and maturity that has led to an increasing number of applications in the pharmaceutical sector. However, interfacing the models with experimental data can become a significant computational burden. To mitigate the computational burden, the present study introduces a neural network (NN) that emulates the AP for given maximum conductances of selected ion channels, pumps, and exchangers. Its applicability in pharmacological studies was tested on synthetic and experimental data. The NN emulator enabled a massive speed-up of more than 104 compared to regular simulations and the forward problem (find drugged AP for pharmacological parameters defined as scaling factors of control maximum conductances) on synthetic data could be solved with average root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 0.47 mV in normal APs and of 13.6 mV in abnormal APs exhibiting early afterdepolarizations (72% of the emulated APs were alining with the abnormality, and the substantial majority of the remaining APs demonstrated pronounced proximity). This demonstrates not only very fast and mostly very accurate AP emulations but also the capability of accounting for discontinuities, a major advantage over existing emulation strategies. Furthermore, the inverse problem (find pharmacological parameters for control and drugged APs through optimization) on synthetic data could be solved with high accuracy shown by a maximum RMSE of 0.21 in the estimated pharmacological parameters. However, notable mismatches were observed between pharmacological parameters estimated from experimental data and distributions obtained from the Comprehensive in Vitro Proarrhythmia Assay initiative. This reveals larger inaccuracies which can be attributed particularly to the fact that small tissue preparations were studied while the emulator was trained on single cardiomyocyte data. Overall, our study highlights the potential of NN emulators as powerful tool for an increased efficiency in future quantitative systems pharmacology studies.",

    "abstract": "The scarcity of effective biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for predicting disease onset and progression in Alzheimers disease (AD) is a major challenge to improve much-needed therapeutic outcomes. Conventional drug discovery approaches have been unsuccessful in providing efficient interventions due to their  one-size-fits-all nature. As an alternative, personalised drug development holds promise to pre-select responders and identify suitable drug efficacy indicators. In this study, we established a preclinical drug testing strategy by assessing the efficacy of anti-inflammatory drugs in 2D and 3D in vitro models of monocyte-derived microglia-like cells (MDMi) derived from AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and matched healthy individuals. We observed that the cytokine inflammatory profiles of MDMi in response to drugs clustered separately between cohorts, with the 3D model showing a more defined separation between healthy and patient donors than 2D. By ranking donor and cytokine responses to drugs, we identified that drug efficacy was limited in AD patients and involved cohort-specific responsive cytokines. Our findings suggest that MDMi models have the potential to predict disease progression, stratify responders and identify biomarkers for estimating the efficacy of microglia-targeted drugs. Together, our pipeline could serve as a valuable tool to enhance the clinical translational value of preclinical drug screens and ultimately improve drug outcomes for AD.",

We used molecular modelling to compare the S protein structures of Omicron and XBB and found that XBB had a reduced receptor-binding domain (RBD) due to the loss of some {beta}-sheets, which may increase its affinity to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. We also used Fast Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation (FUBAR) and Recombination Detection Program 4 (RDP 4) to perform selection and recombination analysis of the S protein sequences of Omicron and XBB and detected signals of positive selection and recombination in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S1 subunit, which contains antibody-binding epitopes, and the RBD, which is involved in viral entry.

    "abstract": "Aimsprogrammed death-1 (PD-1) is a negative regulator of immune responses. Upon deletion of PD-1 in mice, symptoms of autoimmunity developed only after they got old. In a model experiment in cancer immunotherapy, PD-1 was shown to prevent cytotoxic T lymphocytes from attacking cancer cells that expressed neoantigens derived from genome mutations. Furthermore, the larger number of genome mutations in cancer cells led to the more robust anti-tumor immune responses after the PD-1 blockade. In order to understand the common molecular mechanisms underlying these findings, we hypothesize that we might have acquired PD-1 during evolution in order to avoid/suppress autoimmune reactions against neoantigens derived from mutations in the genome of aged individuals. Main methods: to test the hypothesis, we introduced random mutations into the genome of young PD-1-/- and PD-1+/+ mice. We employed two different procedures of random mutagenesis: administration of a potent chemical mutagen N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) into the peritoneal cavity of mice and deletion of MSH2, which is essential for the mismatch-repair activity in the nucleus and, therefore, for the suppression of accumulation of random mutations in the genome.\n\nKey findingswe observed granulomatous inflammatory changes in the liver of the ENU-treated PD-1 knockout (KO) mice, but not in the wild-type (WT) counterparts. Such lesions also developed in the PD-1/MSH2 double KO mice, but not in the MSH2 single KO mice. Significance: the results we obtained support our hypothesis: PD-1 probably functions to avoid/suppress inflammatory responses against neoantigens derived from genome mutations in aged individuals.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundStreptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus, GBS) is a commensal Gram-positive bacterium found in the human gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts. Much of what is known about GBS relates to the diseases it causes in pregnant people and neonates. However, GBS is a common cause of disease in the general population with 90% of GBS mortality occurring in non-pregnant people. There are limited data about the predisposing factors for GBS and the reservoirs in the body. To gain an understanding of the determinants of gastrointestinal GBS carriage, we used stool samples and associated metadata to determine the prevalence and abundance of GBS in the gut microbiome of adults and find risk factors for GBS status.\n\nMethodsWe used 754 stool samples collected from adults in Wisconsin from 2016-2017 to test for the prevalence and abundance of GBS using a Taqman probe-based qPCR assay targeting two GBS-specific genes: cfp and sip. We compared the microbiome compositions of the stool samples by GBS status using 16S rRNA analysis. We compared associations with GBS status and 557 survey variables collected during sample acquisition (demographics, diet, overall health, and reproductive health) using univariate and multivariate analyses.\n\nResultsWe found 137/754 (18%) of participants had detectable GBS in their stool samples with a median abundance of 104 copies per nanogram of starting DNA. There was no difference in GBS status or abundance based on gender. Beta-diversity, Bray-Curtis and Unweighted UniFrac, was significantly different based on carrier status of the participant. Prior to p-value correction, 59/557 (10.6%) survey variables were significantly associated with GBS carrier status and 11/547 (2.0%) variables were significantly associated with abundance (p-value<0.05). After p-value correction, 2/547 (0.4%) variables were associated with GBS abundance: an increased abundance of GBS was associated with a decreased frequency since last dental checkup (p<0.001) and last dental cleaning (p<0.001). Increased GBS abundance was significantly associated with increased frequency of iron consumption (p=0.007) after p-value correction in multivariate models.\n\nConclusionsGBS is found in stool samples from adults in Wisconsin at similar frequencies as pregnant individuals screened with rectovaginal swabs. We did not find associations between risk factors historically associated with GBS in pregnant people, suggesting that risk factors for GBS carriage in pregnancy may differ from those in the general population. We found that frequency of iron consumption and dental hygiene are risk factors for GBS carriage in Wisconsin adults. Given that these variables were not assayed in previous GBS surveys, it is possible they also influence carriage in pregnant people. Taken together, this work serves as a foundation for future work in developing approaches to decrease GBS abundance in carriers.",

    "abstract": "Wildfires affect soils in multiple ways, leading to numerous challenges for colonizing microbes. While it is thought that fire-adapted microbes lie at the forefront of postfire ecosystem recovery, the specific strategies that these microbes use to thrive in burned soils remain largely unknown. Through bioactivity screening of bacterial isolates from burned soils, we discovered that several Paraburkholderia spp. isolates produced a set of unusual rhamnolipid surfactants with a natural methyl ester modification. These rhamnolipid methyl esters (RLMEs) exhibited enhanced antimicrobial activity against other postfire microbial isolates, including pyrophilous Pyronema fungi and Amycolatopsis bacteria, compared to the typical rhamnolipids made by organisms such as Pseudomonas spp. RLMEs also showed enhanced surfactant properties and facilitated bacterial motility on agar surfaces. In vitro assays further demonstrated that RLMEs improved aqueous solubilization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are potential carbon sources found in char. Identification of the rhamnolipid biosynthesis genes in the postfire isolate, Paraburkholderia caledonica str. F3, led to the discovery of rhlM, whose gene product is responsible for the unique methylation of rhamnolipid substrates. RhlM is the first characterized bacterial representative of a large class of integral membrane methyltransferases that are widespread in bacteria. These results indicate multiple roles for RLMEs in the postfire lifestyle of Paraburkholderia isolates, including enhanced dispersal, solubilization of potential nutrients, and inhibition of competitors. Our findings shed new light on the chemical adaptations that bacteria employ in order to navigate, grow, and outcompete other soil community members in postfire environments.\n\nSignificance StatementWildfires are increasing in frequency and intensity at a global scale. Microbes are the first colonizers of soil after fire events, but the adaptations that help these organisms survive in postfire environments are poorly understood. In this work, we show that a bacterium isolated from burned soil produces an unusual rhamnolipid biosurfactant that exhibits antimicrobial activity, enhances motility, and solubilizes potential nutrients derived from pyrolyzed organic matter. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that bacteria leverage specialized metabolites with multiple functions to meet the demands of life in postfire environments.

Synthetic drugs have been preferred for over decades but recently many plants have been reported for their antibacterial activity. The aim of this study is to investigate the antibacterial effect of mechanically ground and spray dried Acacia senegal against Enterococcus faecalis.\n\nMethodAntibacterial susceptibility test against Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) has been performed for 200mg of ethanolic extracts of spray dried & mechanically ground Gum Arabic. Sodium Hypochlorite (1%), Chlorhexidine (0.2%) and Antibiotic multi disc for gram positive bacteria have been used as positive controls and ethanol as a negative control. The diameter of the inhibition zones have been measured.\n\nResultsspray dried Gum Arabic (14.67 mm) was significantly higher than mechanically ground (8.67mm). (p-value=0.02)\n\nGum Arabic, with both processing methods, exhibited lower antibacterial activity against E. faecalis than chlorhexidine (0.2%).The result was significant with mechanically ground variant (P-value=.005), but the spray dried Gum showed no significance.\n\nSpray dried Gum Arabic displayed significantly higher antibacterial activity against E. faecalis than (Tetracycline 300mcg) (p-value=.0049). While mechanically ground showed lower antibacterial activity than Tetracycline with no statistical significance.\n\nConclusionMethod of Gum Arabic processing affected its antibacterial potency. Spray-dried Gum Arabic is considered an active antibacterial agent against E. faecalis, while mechanically ground type is considered a non-active.\n\nImportanceEnterococcus faecalis has the ability to colonize and hide within the dentinal tubules in the tooth. Dentinal tubules are not accessible by instrumentation during endodontic treatment, they can only be reached and cleaned by irrigation. The problem faced by dentists is that E. faecalis is resistant to sodium hypochlorite, the standard irrigant for endodontic microbiota.\n\nThe possibility of using Gum Arabic as a natural antibacterial agent against E. faecalis will help to improve the oral health with low cost and with no side effects commonly associated with synthetics antibacterial agents.",

    "abstract": "Among the various bacteria present in activated sludge, uncultivated Patescibacteria (also known as the Candidate Phyla Radiation/CPR superphylum) are ubiquitous at the class or phylum level. Patescibacteria have a highly restricted metabolic capacity and are thought to be episymbiotic/endosymbiotic or predatory. However, only a limited number of Patescibacteria and their hosts have been identified. Therefore, many Patescibacteria have not been (co-)cultured and identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or electron microscopy. Little is known about the morphology, metabolic potential, and hosts of Gracilibacteria (formerly GN02 or BD1-5) which belong to Patescibacteria. In our previous study, we confirmed the presence of Gracilibacteria in activated sludge and successfully recovered its high-quality genome. In this study, we designed new probes to visualize members of Gracilibacteria in activated sludge and identified its host using FISH. The FISH observations revealed that Gracilibacteria, which formed loosely associated clusters, were located within dense clusters of Zoogloea, which were dominant in the activated sludge. The metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of Zoogloea possessed genes related to extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) biosynthesis, floc formation, and nutrient removal, including a polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) accumulation pathway. The MAGs of Gracilibacteria possessed genes associated with type IV pili, competence protein EC (ComEC), and PHA degradation, which suggests that they have a Zoogloea-dependent lifestyle in activated sludge flocs.

    "abstract": "Antiretroviral therapy is not a cure for HIV-1 infection, as viral rebound inevitably occurs following discontinuation of treatment. The \"block and lock\" therapeutic strategy seeks to enforce proviral latency and durably suppress viremic reemergence in the absence of other medical intervention. The transcription associated cyclin dependent protein kinases (tCDKs) are required for viral expression from the 5 HIV-1 Long-Terminal Repeat (LTR), but the therapeutic potential of inhibiting these kinases for enforcing HIV-1 latency remains uncharacterized. Here we extended upon previous work to directly compare the effect of highly selective small molecule inhibitors of CDK7 (YKL-5-124), CDK9 (LDC000067), and CDK8/19 (Senexin A), and found each of these prevented HIV-1 provirus expression at concentrations that showed no toxicity. Inhibition of CDK7 caused cell cycle arrest, whereas CDK9 and CDK8/19 inhibitors did not, and could be continuously administered to establish proviral latency. Upon discontinuation of drug administration, HIV immediately rebounded in cells that had been treated with the CDK9 inhibitor, while proviral latency persisted for several days in cells that had been treated with the CDK8/19 inhibitor. Our results identify the mediator kinases CDK8/CDK19 as potential \"block and lock\" targets for therapeutic suppression of HIV-1 provirus expression.",

    "abstract": "The Nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 compacts the RNA genome into viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes within virions. Assembly of vRNPs is inhibited by phosphorylation of the N protein SR region. Several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern carry N protein mutations that reduce phosphorylation and enhance the efficiency of viral packaging. Variants of the dominant B.1.1 viral lineage also encode a truncated N protein, termed N* or {Delta}(1-209), that mediates genome packaging despite lacking the N-terminal RNA-binding domain and SR region. Here, we show that {Delta}(1-209) and viral RNA assemble into vRNPs that are remarkably similar in size and shape to those formed with full-length N protein. We show that assembly of {Delta}(1-209) vRNPs requires the leucine-rich helix (LH) of the central disordered region, and that the LH promotes N protein oligomerization. We also find that fusion of a phosphomimetic SR region to {Delta}(1-209) inhibits RNA binding and vRNP assembly. Our results provide new insights into the mechanisms by which RNA binding promotes N protein self-association and vRNP assembly, and how this process is modulated by SR phosphorylation.",

Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that XBB.1.5 evolved from XBB.1 by acquiring the F486P spike (S) mutation, subsequent to the acquisition of a nonsense mutation in ORF8. Neutralization assays showed similar abilities of immune escape between XBB.1.5 and XBB.1. We determined the structural basis for the interaction between human ACE2 and the S protein of XBB.1.5, showing similar overall structures between the S proteins of XBB.1 and XBB.1.5. The intrinsic pathogenicity of XBB.1.5 in hamsters is lower than that of XBB.1. Importantly, we found that the ORF8 nonsense mutation of XBB.1.5 resulted in impairment of MHC expression. In vivo experiments using recombinant viruses revealed that the XBB.1.5 mutations are involved with reduced virulence of XBB.1.5. Together, these data suggest that the mutations in ORF8 and S could enhance spreading of XBB.1.5 in humans.",

However, owing to the previously reported tumorigenic potential of NSC cell line after intranasal administration (INA), here we identified the human hepatic stellate cell line (LX-2) as a cell type capable of longer resistance to replication of oncolytic adenoviruses (OAV) as therapeutic cargo, and being non-tumorigenic after INA. Our data show that LX-2 cells can longer withstand the OAV XVir-N-31 replication and oncolysis than NSCs. By selecting the highly migratory cell population out of LX-2, an offspring cell line with a higher and more stable capability to migrate was generated. Additionally, as a safety backup, we applied genomic HSV-TK integration into LX-2 leading to the high vulnerability to Ganciclovir. Histopathological analyses confirmed the absence of neoplasia in the respiratory tracts and brains of immuno-compromised mice 3 months after INA of LX-2 cells.

In vitro, RNA inhibits PRC2 catalytic activity and interaction with nucleosomes but the effect of RNA on PRC2 in cells has been unclear, with studies concluding that RNA either antagonises or promotes the association of PRC2 with chromatin. The addition of RNase A to chromatin immunoprecipitation reactions has been reported to reduce detection of PRC2 target sites, suggesting the existence of an RNA bridge that connects PRC2 to chromatin. Here, we show that this apparent loss of PRC2 chromatin association after RNase A treatment is due to non-specific chromatin precipitation. RNA degradation causes chromatin to precipitate out of solution, thereby reducing the enrichment of specific DNA sequences in chromatin immunoprecipitation reactions. Maintaining chromatin solubility by the addition of poly-L-glutamic acid (PGA) rescues detection of PRC2 chromatin association upon RNA degradation. These findings undermine support for the model that RNA bridges PRC2 and chromatin in cells.",

Conventional DIPs (cDIPs) contain a deletion in the genome and can only replicate upon co-infection with infectious standard virus (STV), during which they suppress STV replication. We previously discovered a new type of IAV DIP \"OP7\" that entails genomic point mutations and displays higher antiviral efficacy than cDIPs. To avoid safety concerns for the medical use of OP7 preparations, we developed a production system that does not depend on infectious IAV. We reconstituted a mixture of DIPs consisting of cDIPs and OP7 chimera DIPs, in which both harbor a deletion in their genome. To complement the defect, the deleted viral protein is expressed by the suspension cell line used for production in shake flasks. Here, DIP preparations harvested are not contaminated with infectious virions, and the fraction of OP7 chimera DIPs depended on the multiplicity of infection. Intranasal administration of OP7 chimera DIP material was well tolerated. A rescue from an otherwise lethal IAV infection and no signs of disease upon OP7 chimera DIP co-infection demonstrated the remarkable antiviral efficacy. The clinical development of this new class of broad-spectrum antiviral may contribute to pandemic preparedness.",

The comparison between the Omega6 and Delta12 homology models specifically in regards to the binding affinity as a function of carbon chain length indicates that there is a dip in binding affinity near the 18:2 carbon chain length but the rest maintain a rather consistent binding affinity throughout.

    "abstract": "Human-induced climate change has intensified negative impacts on socioeconomic factors, the environment, and biodiversity, including changes in rainfall patterns and an increase in global average temperatures. Drylands are particularly at risk, with projections suggesting they will become hotter, drier, and less suitable for a significant portion of their species, potentially leading to mammal defaunation. We use ecological niche modelling and community ecology biodiversity metrics to examine potential geographical range shifts of non-volant mammal species in the largest Neotropical dryland, the Caatinga, and evaluate impacts of climate change on mammal assemblages. According to projections, 85% of the mammal species will lose suitable habitats, with one quarter of species projected to completely lose suitable habitats by 2060. This will result in a decrease in species richness for more than 90% of assemblages and an increase in compositional similarity to nearby assemblages (i.e., reduction in spatial beta diversity) for 70% of the assemblages. Small-sized mammals will be the most impacted and lose most of their suitable habitats, especially in highlands. The scenario is even worse in the eastern half of Caatinga where habitat destruction already prevails, compounding the threats faced by species there. While species-specific responses can vary with respect to dispersal, behaviour, and energy requirements, our findings indicate that climate change can drive mammal assemblages to biotic homogenisation and species loss, with drastic changes in assemblage trophic structure. For successful long-term socioenvironmental policy and conservation planning, it is critical that findings from biodiversity forecasts are considered.",

This activity primarily relies on the ESX-1 secretion system, predominantly involving the protein duo ESAT-6 and CFP-10. CFP-10 likely acts as a chaperone, while ESAT-6 likely disrupts phagosomal membrane stability via a largely unknown mechanism. we employ a series of biochemical analyses, protein modeling techniques, and a novel ESAT-6-specific nanobody to gain insight into the ESAT-6s mode of action. First, we measure the binding kinetics of the tight 1:1 complex formed by ESAT-6 and CFP-10 at neutral pH. Subsequently, we demonstrate a rapid self-association of ESAT-6 into large complexes under acidic conditions, leading to the identification of a stable tetrameric ESAT-6 species. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we pinpoint the most probable interaction interface. Furthermore, we show that cytoplasmic expression of an anti-ESAT-6 nanobody blocks Mtb replication, thereby underlining the pivotal role of ESAT-6 in intracellular survival. Together, these data suggest that ESAT-6 acts by a pH dependent mechanism to establish two-way communication between the cytoplasm and the Mtb-containing phagosome.",

    "abstract": "Hyperpolarization and cyclic-nucleotide (HCN) activated ion channels play a critical role in generating self-propagating action potentials in pacemaking and rhythmic electrical circuits in the human body. Unlike most voltage-gated ion channels, the HCN channels activate upon membrane hyperpolarization, but the structural mechanisms underlying this gating behavior remain unclear. Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of human HCN1 in Closed, Intermediate, and Open states. Our structures reveal that the inward motion of two gating charges past the charge transfer center (CTC) and concomitant tilting of the S5 helix drives the opening of the central pore. In the intermediate state structure, a single gating charge is positioned below the CTC and the pore appears closed, whereas in the open state structure, both charges move past CTC and the pore is fully open. Remarkably, the downward motion of the voltage sensor is accompanied by progressive unwinding of the inner end of S4 and S5 helices disrupting the tight gating interface that stabilizes the Closed state structure. This \"melting\" transition at the intracellular gating interface leads to a concerted iris-like displacement of S5 and S6 helices, resulting in pore opening. These findings reveal key structural features that are likely to underlie reversed voltage-dependence of HCN channels.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria use a diverse range of carbohydrates to generate a profusion of glycans, with amino sugars such as N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) being prevalent in the cell wall and in many exopolysaccharides. The primary substrate for GlcNAc-containing glycans, UDP-GlcNAc, is the product of the bacterial hexosamine pathway, and a key target for bacterial metabolic glycan engineering. Using the strategy of expressing NahK, to circumvent the hexosamine pathway, it is possible to directly feed the analogue of GlcNAc, N-azidoacetylglucosamine (GlcNAz), for metabolic labelling in E. coli. The cytosolic production of UDP-GlcNAz was confirmed using fluorescence assisted polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The key question of where GlcNAz is incorporated, was interrogated by analyzing potential sites including: peptidoglycan (PGN), the biofilm-related exopolysaccharide poly-{beta}-1,6-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the enterobacterial common antigen (ECA). The highest levels of incorporation were observed in PGN with lower levels in PNAG and no observable incorporation in LPS or ECA. The promiscuity of the PNAG synthase (PgaCD) towards UDP-GlcNAz in vitro and lack of undecaprenyl-pyrophosphoryl-GlcNAz intermediates generated in vivo confirmed the incorporation preferences. The results of this work will guide the future development of carbohydrate-based probes and metabolic engineering strategies.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=127 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/553294v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c4a9c9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@66f71corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e981bcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14489b4_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "From transcription to decay, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) influence RNA metabolism. Using the RBP2GO database that combines proteome-wide RBP screens from 13 species, we investigated the RNA-binding features of 176896 proteins. By compiling published lists of RNA-binding domains (RBDs) and RNA-related protein family (Rfam) IDs with lists from the InterPro database, we analyzed the distribution of the RBDs and Rfam IDs in RBPs and non-RBPs to select RBDs and Rfam IDs that were enriched in RBPs. We also explored proteins for their content of intrinsically disordered region (IDRs) and found a strong positive correlation between IDRs and RBDs. Our bioinformatic analysis indicated that RBDs/Rfam IDs were strong indicators of the RNA-binding potential of proteins and helped predicting new RBP candidates, especially in species with few available proteome-wide RBP identification studies. By further analyzing RBPs with no known RBD, we also predicted 15 new RBDs that were experimentally validated by RNA-bound peptides. Finally, we created the new RBP2GO composite score by combining the RBP2GO score with new quality factors linked to RBDs and Rfam IDs. Based on the RBP2GO composite score, we compiled a list of 2018 high-confidence human RBPs. The knowledge collected here was integrated into the RBP2GO database at https://RBP2GO.dkfz.de.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=147 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/553134v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (38K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f65190org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@64ebe6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bb558dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1eda0f8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Key PointsO_LIComprehensive analysis of RNA-related protein domains and families enriched in RNA-binding proteins (RBPs)\nC_LIO_LIPan-species prediction of new RBPs, and prediction and validation of new RNA-binding domains\nC_LIO_LIOnline resource with complete dataset including high-confidence human RBPs according to a new scoring system\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Understanding the structures of proteins has numerous applications, such as vaccine development. It is a slow and labor-intensive task to manually build protein structures from experimental electron density maps, therefore, machine learning approaches have been proposed to automate this process. However, most of the experimental maps are not atomic resolution, so they are insufficient for computer vision-based machine learning methods to precisely determine the protein structure. On the other hand, methods that utilize evolutionary information from protein sequences to predict structures, like AlphaFold2, have recently achieved groundbreaking accuracy but often require manual effort to refine the results. We propose DeepTracer-Refine, an automated method to refine AlphaFold structures by aligning them to DeepTracers predicted structure. We tested our method on 39 multi-domain proteins and we improved the average residue coverage from 78.2% to 90.0% and average lDDT score from 0.67 to 0.71. We also compared DeepTracer-Refine against another method, Phenixs AlphaFold refinement, to demonstrate that our method not only performs better when the initial AlphaFold model is less precise but also exceeds Phenix in run-time performance.",

    "abstract": "Molecular simulations are commonly used to understand the mechanism of membrane permeation of small molecules, particularly for biomedical and pharmaceutical applications. However, despite significant advances in computing power and algorithms, calculating an accurate permeation free energy profile remains elusive for many drug molecules because it can require identifying the rate-limiting degrees of freedom (i.e., appropriate reaction coordinates). To resolve this issue, researchers have developed machine learning approaches to identify slow system dynamics. In this work, we apply time-lagged independent component analysis (tICA), an unsupervised dimensionality reduction algorithm, to molecular dynamics simulations with well-tempered metadynamics to find the slowest collective degrees of freedom of the permeation process of trimethoprim through a multicomponent membrane. We show that tICA-metadynamics yields translational and orientational collective variables (CVs) that increase convergence efficiency [~]1.5 times. However, crossing the periodic boundary is shown to introduce artefacts in the translational CV that can be corrected by taking absolute values of molecular features. Additionally, we find that the convergence of the tICA CVs is reached with approximately five membrane crossings, and that data reweighting is required to avoid deviations in the translational CV.",

The vesicle docking process involves the formation of nanoscale Syx1a domains on the plasma membrane and the Syx1a clusters disintegrate during the fusion process.

In this work, the dynamics of the Syx1a molecules is elucidated relative to the cluster position through a labeling strategy that allows both the bulk position of the Syx clusters to be visualized concurrent with the trajectories of single Syx1a molecules on the surface of PC12 cells. Single Syx1a molecules were tracked in time relative to cluster positions to decipher how Syx1a moves within a cluster and when clusters are not present. Syx1a is mobile on the plasma membrane, more mobile at the center of clusters, and less mobile near the edges of clusters; this depends on the presence of the N-terminal Habc domain and cholesterol, which are essential for proper exocytosis. Simulations of the dynamics observed at clusters support a model where clusters are maintained by a large cage (r = 100 nm) within which Syx1a remains highly mobile within the cluster (r = 50 nm). The depletion of cholesterol dramatically reduces the mobility of Syx1a within clusters and less so over the rest of the plasma membrane.

Here we characterise a first set of gene drives in a tephritid agricultural pest species, the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata (medfly). Our results show that the medfly is highly amenable to homing-based gene drive strategies. By targeting the medfly transformer gene, we also demonstrate two different mechanisms by which CRISPR-Cas9 gene drive can be coupled to sex conversion, whereby genetic females are transformed into fertile and harmless XX males. Given this unique malleability of sex determination, we modelled gene drive interventions that couple sex conversion and female sterility and found that such approaches could be effective and tolerant of resistant allele selection in the target population. Our results open the door for developing gene drive strains for the population suppression of the medfly and related tephritid pests by co-targeting female reproduction and shifting the reproductive sex ratio towards males. They demonstrate the untapped potential for gene drives to tackle agricultural pests in an environmentally friendly and economical way.",

We first optimized methods to generate cell-type specific QF2 driver and QUAS responder lines to map expression patterns of these chemoreceptors across mosquito sensory appendages. We next applied transcuticular calcium imaging to record neurophysiological responses to select human-related odorants for each OSN class.

    "abstract": "Acute bacterial orchitis (AO) is a prevalent cause of intra-scrotal inflammation, often resulting in sub-or infertility. A frequent cause eliciting AO is uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), a gram negative pathovar, characterized by the expression of various iron acquisition systems to survive in a low-iron environment. On the host side, iron is tightly regulated by iron regulatory proteins (IRP) 1 and 2 and these factors have been reported to play a role in testicular and immune cell function, however, their precise role remains unclear. Here, we show in a mouse model of UPEC-induced orchitis that the absence of IRP1 results in reduced immune response and testicular damage. Compared to infected wild-type (WT)-mice, testis of UPEC-infected Irp1-/- mice showed impaired ERK signalling. Conversely, IRP2 deletion led to a stronger inflammatory response. Notably, differences in immune cell infiltrations were observed among the different genotypes. In contrast to WT and Irp2-/- mice, no increase in monocytes and neutrophils was detected in testis of Irp1-/- mice upon UPEC-infection. Interestingly, in Irp1-/- UPEC-infected testis, we observed an increase in a subpopulation of macrophages (F4/80+ CD206+) associated with anti-inflammatory and wound-healing activities compared to WT. These findings suggest that IRP1 deletion may protect against UPEC-induced inflammation by modulating ERK signalling and dampening the immune response.",

    "abstract": "Epstein-Barr virus is highly associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) with genes expressed for tumor transformation or maintenance of viral latency, but there are certain genes that can modulate immune molecules. Butyrophilin 2A1 (BTN2A1) is an important activating protein for presenting phosphoantigen presentation for recognition by V{gamma}9V{delta}2 T cells to achieve anti-tumor activities. We have previously shown that V{gamma}9V{delta}2 T cells achieve efficacy against NPC when BTN2A1 and BTN3A1 are upregulated by stimulating EBV gene expression, particularly LMP1. Whilst BTN3A1 can be induced by LMP1 mediated IFN-{gamma}/JNK/NLRC5 pathway, the viral gene that can regulate BTN2A1 remains elusive. Here, we showed that BTN2A1 expression is directly mediated by EBV BRRF1, which can trigger BTN2A1 promoter and downstream JAK3-STAT3 pathway in NPC43 cells as enlightened by RNA-seq data and verified by inhibitor experiments. Further, BRRF1 downregulated IL-22 binding protein (IL-22RA2) to complement the EBNA1-targeting probe (P4) induced IL-22 expression. These functions act in concordance to enhance the expression of BTN2A1, which likely lead to increased tumor cell killing by V{gamma}9V{delta}2 T cells. Overall, this study elucidated a new mechanism of stimulating BTN2A1 expression in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells by the EBV gene BRRF1.\n\nSummary statementThis study demonstrated a new function Epstein-Barr Virus BRRF1 to induce BTN2A1 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma via the IL-22/JAK3-STAT3 pathway, which potentiates V{gamma}9V{delta}2 T cells against NPC.",

This study aimed to investigate whether the decreased production of growth factors during postnatal mammalian development contributes to the exit of cardiomyocytes from the cell cycle and the reduction in cardiac regenerative ability.\n\nWe identified growth factors with declining expression levels during early postnatal life in the mouse model and assessed the pro-proliferative ability of these factors on neonatal murine primary cardiomyocytes in vitro. Our findings confirmed the previously reported pro-proliferative effects of NRG1, IL1b, RANKL, IGF2 and IL6, while also identifying novel potential pro-regenerative growth factors. Among them, BMP7 exhibited the most pronounced efficacy.\n\nBmp7 knockdown interfered with the proliferation of neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes in culture and adult bmp7 mutant zebrafish displayed reduced cardiomyocyte proliferation during heart regeneration, indicating that Bmp7 is crucial for cardiomyocyte proliferation in the regenerative stages of mouse and zebrafish hearts. Conversely, bmp7 overexpression was sufficient to boost cardiomyocyte cycling in regenerating zebrafish hearts, while BMP7 administration stimulated mouse cardiomyocyte cycling at postnatal-day-7, when cardiomyocytes ceased to proliferate, and enhanced cardiomyocyte regeneration in vivo in adult mice following myocardial infarction.\n\nMechanistically, BMP7-induced proliferation was mediated by type I BMP receptors BMPR1A and ACVR1, and type II receptors ACVR2A and BMPR2. Downstream signalling involved SMAD5, ERK and AKT.\n\nIn conclusion, the administration of BMP7 holds promise as a strategy to stimulate heart regeneration following cardiac injury.",

Despite the knowledge that within-host bacterial evolution occurs in the intestine, the disease has so far rarely been studied from an evolutionary perspective. In this study, we aimed to investigate resident bacterial evolution during intestinal inflammation, and whether- and how disease-related bacterial genetic changes may present trade-offs with potential therapeutic importance.\n\nDesignHere, we perform an in vivo evolution experiment of E. coli in a gnotobiotic mouse model of IBD, followed by multiomic analyses to identify disease-specific genetic and phenotypic changes in bacteria evolved in an inflamed versus non-inflamed control environment.\n\nResultsOur results demonstrate distinct evolutionary changes in E. coli specific to inflammation, including a single nucleotide variant that independently reached high frequency in all inflamed mice. Using ex vivo fitness assays, we find that these changes are associated with a higher fitness in an inflamed environment compared to isolates derived from non-inflamed mice. Further, using large-scale phenotypic assays, we show that bacterial adaptation to inflammation results in clinically relevant phenotypes, which intriguingly include collateral sensitivity towards antibiotics.\n\nConclusionsBacterial evolution in an inflamed gut yields specific genetic and phenotypic signatures.

In this species, integrative analysis of multi-omics data has shed light on the regulatory functions of TEs. However, there remains a notable gap in our understanding of TEs in domesticated animals. we annotated TEs in the genomes of pigs, cattle, and chickens, respectively, and systematically compared the genome distributions and amplification patterns of TEs across these three species. Furthermore, by integrating multi-tissue RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and histone modification ChIP-seq data, we explored the expression atlas of TEs and their contribution to cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in different tissues of the three species. Most importantly, we developed a novel computational framework that revealed TE-mediated gene regulatory networks (TE-GRNs) underlying tissue-related biological processes. To demonstrate the power of this approach, we applied our framework to analyze liver tissues across the three different species. Overall, our research provides novel insights into the regulatory functions of TEs in livestock animals and highlights a computational framework to uncover TE-GRNs in various biological contexts.",

    "abstract": "Transport of macromolecules through the nuclear envelope (NE) is mediated by nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) consisting of nucleoporins (Nups). Elys/Mel-28 is the Nup that binds and connects the decondensing chromatin with the reassembled NPCs at the end of mitosis. Whether Elys links chromatin with the NE during interphase is unknown. Using DamID-seq, we identified Elys binding sites in Drosophila late embryos and divided them into those associated with nucleoplasmic or with NPC-linked Elys. These Elys binding sites are located within active or inactive chromatin, respectively. Strikingly, Elys knockdown in S2 cells results in peripheral chromatin displacement from the NE, in decondensation of NE-attached chromatin, and in derepression of genes within. It also leads to slightly more compact active chromatin regions. Our findings indicate that NPC-linked Elys, together with the nuclear lamina, anchors peripheral chromatin to the NE, whereas nucleoplasmic Elys decompacts active chromatin.\n\nAuthor summaryHeterochromatin in interphase nucleus is localized mostly at the nuclear periphery. However, the forces maintaining its peripheral localization are not well understood. Nuclear envelope consists of two lipid bilayer membranes separated by perinuclear space. The inner nuclear membrane is lined by the nuclear lamina, and both membranes are pierced by nuclear pore complexes composed of nucleoporins. Nuclear envelope can serve as a scaffold to which heterochromatin is attached. In the present study, we identified nucleoporin Elys as one of the key players maintaining peripheral localization of heterochromatin during interphase. Elys binds to multiple genomic sites located within heterochromatin and thus links it to nuclear pore complexes. However, the nucleoplasmic fraction of Elys binds to active genes and enhancers, resulting in decompactization of their chromatin.",

    "abstract": "The functional properties of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) require allosteric regulation through inter-domain communication. Despite the foundational importance of allostery to biological regulation, almost no studies have been conducted to describe the biophysical nature by which inter-domain communication manifests in RBPs. Here, we show through high-pressure studies with hnRNP A1 that inter-domain communication is vital for the unique stability of its N- terminal domain containing a tandem of RNA Recognition Motifs (RRMs). Despite high sequence similarity and nearly identical tertiary structures, the two RRMs exhibit drastically different stability under pressure. RRM2 unfolds completely under high-pressure as an individual domain, but when appended to RRM1, it remains stable. Variants in which inter-domain communication is disrupted between the tandem RRMs show a large decrease in stability under pressure. Carrying these mutations over to the full-length protein for in vivo experiments revealed that the mutations affected the ability of the disordered C-terminus to engage in protein-protein interactions and more importantly, they also influenced the RNA binding capacity. Collectively, this work reveals that thermodynamic coupling between the tandem RRMs of hnRNP A1 accounts for its allosteric regulatory functions.",

We successfully made recombinant Tv20S by expressing all seven  and seven {beta} subunits together with the Ump-1 chaperone in insect cells. We isolated recombinant proteasome and showed that it was biochemically indistinguishable from the native enzyme. We confirmed that the recombinant Tv20S is inhibited by the natural product marizomib (MZB)9 and the recently developed peptide inhibitor carmaphycin-17 (CP-17)8,10. Specifically, MZB binds to the {beta}1, {beta}2 and {beta}5 subunits, while CP-17 binds the {beta}2 and {beta}5 subunits. Next, we obtained cryo-EM structures of Tv20S in complex with these covalent inhibitors at 2.8[A] resolution. The structures revealed the overall fold of the Tv20S and the binding mode of MZB and CP-17. Our work explains the low specificity of MZB and higher specificity of CP-17 towards Tv20S as compared to human proteasome and provides the platform for the development of Tv20S inhibitors for treatment of trichomoniasis.",

Although the licensed vaccine Shingrix has a remarkably high efficacy, undesired reactogenicity and increasing global demand causing vaccine shortage urged the development of improved or novel VZV vaccines. In this study, we developed a novel VZV mRNA vaccine candidate (named as ZOSAL) containing sequence-optimized mRNAs encoding full-length glycoprotein E encapsulated in an ionizable lipid nanoparticle. In mice and rhesus macaques, ZOSAL demonstrated superior immunogenicity and safety in multiple aspects over Shingrix, especially in the induction of strong T cell immunity. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that both ZOSAL and Shingrix could robustly activate innate immune compartments, especially Type-I IFN signaling and antigen processing/presentation. Multivariate correlation analysis further identified several early factors of innate compartments that can predict the magnitude of T cell responses, which further increased our understanding of the mode of action of two different VZV vaccine modalities. Collectively, our data demonstrated the superiority of VZV mRNA vaccine over licensed subunit vaccine. The mRNA platform therefore holds prospects for further investigations in next-generation VZV vaccine development.",

Here, we first defined the complement of required mammalian biogenesis machinery through genome-wide CRISPRi screens using topologically distinct membrane proteins. Systematic analysis of nine identified factors across 21 diverse -helical substrates reveals that these components are organized into distinct targeting pathways which act on substrates based on their topology. NAC is required for efficient targeting of polytopic proteins whereas signal-anchored proteins require TTC1, a novel cytosolic chaperone which physically engages substrates. Biochemical and mutational studies reveal that TTC1 employs a conserved TPR domain and a hydrophobic groove in its C-terminal domain to support substrate solubilization and insertion into mitochondria. Thus, targeting of diverse mitochondrial membrane proteins is achieved through topological triaging in the cytosol using principles with similarities to ER membrane protein biogenesis systems.",

    "abstract": "Sterile insect techniques can be an efficient solution for reducing or eliminating certain insect pest populations. It is widely and efficiently used in agriculture against fruit flies, including the Mediterranean fly, Ceratitis capitata. The re-mating tendency of medfly females and the fact that sterile males are often released with slight residual fertility can at first sight appear to be detrimental for the successful implementation of SIT. Obtaining the right balance between sterility level and male quality is the key to a cost-efficient program. Since field experimental approaches can be impacted by many environmental variables, it is difficult to get a clear understanding on how some specific parameters can affect, alone or in combination, the efficacy of sterile males release. The use of models not only helps to gather knowledge, but it also helps simulating different situations scenarii and can be easily adapted to local values from the field population and sterile male production.\n\nIn this study, we consider how the minimal release ratio is affected by female re-mating rate (with an equal or higher tendency to re-mating after an insemination by a sterile male) and male residual fertility. Different scenarios were explored: continuous versus periodic releases, with and without ginger aromatherapy, which is known to enhance sterile male competitiveness. Parameters values were chosen from the literature on peach host fruit when available to reflect what could be expected in the Corsican context, for which SIT against the medfly is under consideration. Our results clearly show that low residual fertility is not necessarily detrimental to SIT performance. In contrast, re-mating of wild females provides contrasting results: when re-mating occurs without a change in the refractory period, it is beneficial because it requires the releases of less sterile males. On the other hand, if females mated with a sterile male have a faster re-mating, it is detrimental for the SIT program as the amount of sterile males to release can become too large. We also confirmed that the use of ginger aromatherapy is more than an essential step for SIT success against medfly. Our model can be easily adapted to different context and species, in order to help understanding release strategies and guiding decision making.",

    "abstract": "The physical structure and dynamics of cells are supported by micron-scale actin networks with diverse geometries, protein compositions, and mechanical properties. These networks are composed of actin filaments and numerous actin binding proteins (ABPs), many of which engage multiple filaments simultaneously to crosslink them into specific functional architectures. Mechanical force has been shown to modulate the interactions between several ABPs and individual actin filaments, but it is unclear how this phenomenon contributes to the emergent force-responsive functional dynamics of actin networks. Here, we engineer filament linker complexes and combine them with photo-micropatterning of myosin motor proteins to produce an in vitro reconstitution platform for examining how force impacts the behavior of ABPs within multi-filament assemblies. Our system enables the monitoring of dozens of actin networks with varying architectures simultaneously using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, facilitating detailed dissection of the interplay between force-modulated ABP binding and network geometry. We apply our system to study a dimeric form of the critical cell-cell adhesion protein -catenin, a model force-sensitive ABP. We find that myosin forces increase -catenins engagement of small filament bundles embedded within networks. This activity is absent in a force-sensing deficient mutant, whose binding scales linearly with bundle size in both the presence and absence of force. These data are consistent with filaments in smaller bundles bearing greater per-filament loads that enhance -catenin binding, a mechanism that could equalize -catenins distribution across actin-myosin networks of varying sizes in cells to regularize their stability and composition.",

We used cell culture studies and molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate its structure and permeability mechanisms. We provide a model that underscores the crucial role of the D55 residue in the CLDN15 selectivity filter, which interacts with permeating cations. Our studies demonstrated the mechanisms whereby the size and charge of the D55 residue influence paracellular permeability. By altering D55 to larger, negatively charged glutamic acid (E) or similarly sized neutral asparagine (N), we observed changes in pore size and selectivity, respectively. D55E mutation decreased pore size, favoring small ion permeability without affecting charge selectivity, while D55N mutation led to reduced charge selectivity without markedly altering size selectivity. These findings shed light on the complex interplay of size and charge selectivity of CLDN15 channels. This knowledge can inform the development of strategies to modulate the function of CLDN15 and similar channels, which has implications for tight junction modulation in health and disease.\n\nSUMMARYUsing cell culture and molecular dynamics simulations, we have clarified the role of amino acid D55 in the claudin-15 channel function.

To secure this evolutionary heritage along with the benefits it provides to humanity, there is a need to understand where in space the greatest losses are predicted to occur. We therefore present threatened evolutionary history mapped for all tetrapod groups, globally and within Biodiversity Hotspots, and identify priority regions of Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) species at both a grid cell and national level. We find that threatened evolutionary history peaks in Cameroon, whilst EDGE species richness peaks in Madagascar. We refined and advanced the 2013 EDGE Zone concept for spatially prioritising phylogenetic diversity using a novel complementarity procedure with uncertainty incorporated for 33,628 tetrapod species. This involved using extinction risk, phylogenetic, and spatial data to iteratively select areas with the highest accumulated threatened evolutionary history driven by unique species compositions. We identify 25 priority EDGE Zones, which are insufficiently protected and disproportionately exposed to high levels of human pressure. Together, the 25 EDGE Zones occupy 0.723% of the worlds surface but harbour one-third of the worlds threatened evolutionary history, half of which is endemic to these grid cells. They also contain part of the distribution of 918 EDGE tetrapod species, representing near one-third of all EDGE species, with 480 being endemic. Our tetrapod EDGE Zones highlight areas of immediate concern for researchers, practitioners, policymakers, and communicators looking to safeguard the Tree of Life.",

    "abstract": "Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, play a pivotal role in maintaining brain homeostasis and responding to various pathological conditions1,2. Neuroinflammation, characterized by the activation of microglia and subsequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous neurodegenerative diseases. Among these cytokines, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) has gained significant attention due to its role in attracting immune cells and its potential contribution to neuronal inflammation. This review aims to comprehensively elucidate the involvement of microglial CCL2 in neuronal inflammation and its relevance to neurodegenerative diseases. We discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying CCL2 production, its receptors on neurons, and the downstream signaling pathways that initiate and perpetuate neuroinflammation. Furthermore, we explore the bidirectional communication between microglia and neurons, highlighting how neuronal dysfunction can trigger microglial CCL2 release and subsequent immune responses3-5. Additionally, we examine the implications of CCL2-mediated neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimers disease6,7, Parkinsons disease8, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Lastly, we discuss potential therapeutic strategies targeting the microglial CCL2 axis to modulate neuroinflammation and ameliorate neurodegenerative processes.",

    "abstract": "Biobanking of tissue from clinically obtained kidney biopsies for later use with multi-omic and imaging techniques is an inevitable step to overcome the need of disease model systems and towards translational medicine. Hence, collection protocols ensuring integration into daily clinical routines using preservation media not requiring liquid nitrogen but instantly preserving kidney tissue for clinical and scientific analyses of paramount importance. Thus, we modified a robust single nucleus dissociation protocol for kidney tissue stored snap frozen or in the preservation media RNAlater and CellCover. Using porcine kidney tissue as surrogate for human kidney tissue, we conducted single nucleus RNA sequencing with the Chromium 10X Genomics platform. The resulting data sets from each storage condition were analyzed to identify any potential variations in transcriptomic profiles. Furthermore, we assessed the suitability of the preservation media for additional analysis techniques (proteomics, metabolomics) and the preservation of tissue architecture for histopathological examination including immunofluorescence staining. In this study, we show that in daily clinical routines the RNAlater facilitates the collection of highly preserved kidney biopsies and enables further analysis with cutting-edge techniques like single nucleus RNA sequencing, proteomics, and histopathological evaluation. Only metabolome analysis is currently restricted to snap frozen tissue. This work will contribute to build tissue biobanks with well-defined cohorts of the respective kidney disease that can be deeply molecularly characterized, opening new horizons for the identification of unique cells, pathways and biomarkers for the prevention, early identification, and targeted therapy of kidney diseases.",

    "abstract": "The natural barrier function of the epidermal skin layer poses a significant challenge to nanoparticle-mediated topical delivery. A key factor in this barrier function is the thickness of the stratum corneum (SC) layer within the epidermis, which varies across different anatomical sites. The epidermis from the palms and soles, for instance, have thicker SC compared to those from other areas. Previous studies have attempted to bypass the SC layer for nanoparticle penetration by using physical disruption; however, these studies have mostly focused on non-thick skin. In this study, we investigate the role of mechano-physical strategies on SC of thick skin for transdermal nanoparticle penetration. We characterize and compare two mechano-physical strategies, namely tape-stripping and microneedle abrasion, for epidermal disruption in both thick and thin skin. Furthermore, we examine the impact of SC disruption in thick and thin skin on the penetration of topically applied 100 nm sized polystyrene nanoparticles using an ex-vivo model. Our findings show that tape-stripping reduced the overall thickness of SC in thick skin by 87%, from 67.4 {+/-} 17.3 {micro}m to 8.2 {+/-} 8.5 {micro}m, whereas it reduced thin skin SC by only 38%, from 9.9 {+/-} 0.6 {micro}m to 6.2 {+/-} 3.2 {micro}m. Compared to non-thick skin, SC disruption in thick skin resulted in higher nanoparticle diffusion. Tape-stripping effectively reduces SC thickness of thick skin and can be potentially utilized for enhanced penetration of topically applied nanoparticles in skin conditions that affect thick skin.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the utilization of tunnels and water transport within enzymes is crucial for the catalytic function of enzymes, as water molecules can stabilize bound substrates and help with unbinding processes of products and inhibitors. Since the choice of water models for molecular dynamics simulations was shown to determine the accuracy of various calculated properties of the bulk solvent and solvated proteins, we have investigated if and to what extent the water transport through the enzyme tunnels depends on the selection of the water model. Here, we have focused on simulating enzymes with various well-defined tunnel geometries. In a systematic investigation using haloalkane dehalogenase as a model system, we focused on the well-established TIP3P, OPC, and TIP4P-Ew water models to explore their impact on using tunnels for water molecules transport. The TIP3P water model showed significantly faster migration, resulting in the transport of approximately 2.5 times more water molecules in comparison to OPC and 2.0 times greater than the TIP4P-Ew. The increase in migration of TIP3P water molecules was mainly due to faster transit times, and in the case of narrower tunnels, greater concurrent transport was evident as well. We have observed similar behavior in two different enzymes with buried active sites and different tunnel network topologies, indicating that our findings are likely not restricted to a particular enzyme family. Our study emphasizes the critical importance of water models in comprehending the use of enzyme tunnels for small molecule transport. Given the significant role of water availability in various stages of the catalytic cycle and solvation of substrates, products, and drugs, choosing an appropriate water model might be crucial for accurate simulations of complex enzymatic reactions, rational enzyme design, and predicting drug residence times.",

    "abstract": "The MYCN oncoprotein broadly binds active promoters in a heterodimer with its partner protein MAX. MYCN also interacts with the nuclear exosome, a 3-5 exoribonuclease complex, suggesting a function in RNA metabolism. Here we show that MYCN forms stable high molecular weight complexes with the exosome and multiple RNA-binding proteins. In cells, MYCN binds to thousands of intronic RNAs; recombinant MYCN directly binds RNA via a short, highly conserved sequence termed MYCBoxI. Perturbing exosome function results in global re-localization of MYCN from promoters to intronic RNAs. At promoters, MYCN is then replaced by the MNT(MXD6) repressor protein, which inhibits MYCN-dependent transcription. MYCN promotes the degradation of its bound introns via the nuclear exosome targeting (NEXT) complex. Our data demonstrate that MYCN is an RNA-binding protein that regulates nascent transcript turnover and show that competition between its RNA- and DNA-bound states links the dynamics of the MYCN/MAX/MXD network to mRNA processing.",

    "abstract": "The HIV-1 Nef accessory factor is critical to the viral life cycle in vivo where it promotes immune escape of HIV-infected cells and viral persistence. While these features identify Nef as an attractive antiretroviral drug target, Nef lacks enzymatic activity and an active site, complicating development of occupancy-based drugs. Here we describe the development of proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) for the targeted degradation of Nef. Nef-binding compounds, based on a previously reported hydroxypyrazole core, were coupled to ligands for ubiquitin E3 ligases via flexible linkers. The resulting bivalent PROTACs induced formation of a ternary complex between Nef and the Cereblon E3 ubiquitin ligase, resulting in ubiquitylation of Nef and proteolytic degradation. Nef-directed PROTACs efficiently rescued Nef-mediated MHC-I and CD4 downregulation in T cells and suppressed HIV-1 replication in donor PBMCs. Targeted degradation of Nef is anticipated to reverse all HIV-1 Nef functions and may help restore adaptive immune responses against HIV-1 reservoir cells in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Insecticide resistance is a serious threat to our ability to control mosquito vectors which transmit pathogens including malaria parasites and arboviruses. Understanding the underlying mechanisms is an essential first step in tackling the challenges presented by resistance. This study aimed to functionally characterise the carboxylesterase, CCEae3A, the elevated expression of which has been implicated in temephos resistance in Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus larvae. Using our GAL4/UAS expression system, already established in insecticide-sensitive Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes, we produced transgenic An. gambiae mosquitoes that express an Ae. aegypti CCEae3A ubiquitously. This new transgenic line permits examination of CCEae3A expression in a background which does not express the gene and allows comparison with existing An. gambiae GAL4-UAS lines. Insecticide resistance profiling of these transgenic An. gambiae larvae indicated significant increases in resistance ratio for three organophosphate insecticides, temephos (5.98), chloropyriphos (6.64) and fenthion (3.18) when compared to the parental strain. Cross resistance to adulticides from three major insecticide classes: organophosphates (malathion, fenitrothion and pirimiphos methyl), carbamates (bendiocarb and propoxur) and pyrethroid (alpha-cypermethrin) was also detected. Resistance to certain organophosphates and carbamates validates conclusions drawn from previous expression and phenotypic data. However, detection of resistance to pirimiphos methyl and alphacypermethrin has not previously been formally associated with CCEae3A, despite occurring in Ae. aegypti strains where this gene was upregulated. Our findings highlight the importance of characterising individual resistance mechanisms, thereby ensuring accurate information is used to guide future vector control strategies.\n\nAuthor SummaryInsecticides are vital disease control tools against pathogen-transmitting mosquitoes. However, they are becoming less effective as mosquitoes develop resistance. Among the molecular changes that contribute to resistance, increased production of enzymes that break down/sequester the insecticide is common. In Ae. aegypti mosquitoes, which spread many arboviruses, over-expression of the carboxylesterase enzyme, CEae3A, has been associated with resistance to certain insecticides used for vector control, particularly organophosphate compounds. However, multiple resistance enzymes/mechanisms are likely to be present in resistant mosquitoes at the same time. To examine the effect of CCEae3A expression in isolation, we utilised the An. gambiae mosquito with its convenient access to GAL4/UAS technology to regulate gene expression. This enabled production of CCEae3A in a normally insecticide-sensitive mosquito strain, permitting expression without interference from other resistance mechanisms. As anticipated, resistance to organophosphates was observed in larvae expressing CCEae3A. In adults, resistance was also found against compounds from organophosphate, carbamate and pyrethroid insecticide classes, including two compounds for which there had been no previous association. As well directly linking CCEae3A expression to specific insecticide resistance, this transgenic line can be included in a panel expressing alternative enzymes to screen new insecticidal compounds for liability to existing resistance mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAnxiety is a common symptom of several mental health disorders and adversely affects motivated behaviors. Anxiety can emerge from associating risk of future harm while engaged in goal-guided actions. Using a recently developed behavioral paradigm to model this aspect of anxiety, we investigated the role of two cortical subregions, the prelimbic medial frontal cortex (PL) and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC), which have been implicated in anxiety and outcome expectation, in flexible representation of actions associated with harm risk.\n\nMethodsA seek-take reward-guided instrumental task design was used to train animals to associate the seek action with a variable risk of punishment. After learning, animals underwent extinction training for this association. Fiber photometry was used to measure and compare neuronal activity in PL and lOFC during learning and extinction.\n\nResultsAnimals increased action suppression in response to punishment contingencies. This increase dissipated after extinction training. These behavioral changes were associated with region specific changes in neuronal activity. PL neuronal activity preferentially adapted to threat of punishment whereas lOFC activity adapted to safe aspects of the task. Moreover, correlated activity between these regions was suppressed during actions associated with harm risk suggesting that these regions may guide behavior independently under anxiety.\n\nConclusionsThese findings suggest the PL and lOFC serve distinct but complementary roles in the representation of learned anxiety. This dissociation may provide a mechanism for how overlapping cortical systems are implicated in reward-guided action execution during anxiety.",

    "abstract": "The dopamine transporter (DAT) plays a crucial role in regulating the brains dopamine (DA) homeostasis. Atypical DAT deficiency syndrome (DTSD) is a disease characterized by early-onset parkinsonism and comorbid psychiatric symptoms, but the pathobiological processes that link DAT dysfunction to both parkinsonism and psychiatric symptoms are unknown. Here, we present a genetic mouse model of atypical DTDS that expresses two coding DAT variants, DAT-I312F and DAT-D421N, derived from a patient diagnosed with ADHD and parkinsonism. Phenotypic characterization of the mutant mice revealed impaired DAT function and major homeostatic changes including increased ambient extracellular DA levels, decreased evoked DA release, and reduced expression of both tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and of DA D1/D2 receptors. This was accompanied by diminished striatal dopaminergic axonal density and a psychomotor phenotype characterized by hyperactivity, enhanced exploratory activity, and pronounced clasping. Importantly, both amphetamine and anticholinergic treatment ameliorated aberrant hyperlocomotion in the mice. Summarized, by replicating core aspects of the patients phenotype, the mouse model not only provides insights into the mechanisms underlying atypical DTDS but also underlines the broad relevance of DA deficits for understanding the co-morbidity between neuropsychiatric diseases and parkinsonism.\n\nONE SENTENCE SUMMARYIn a new mouse disease model, we explore the behavioral consequences and dopaminergic dysfunction that arise from patient-derived mutations in the dopamine transporter associated with parkinsonism and co-morbid neuropsychiatric disease",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary transitions in individuality (ETIs), such as the emergence of multicellularity, are events in the history of life during which entities at one level of organisation (particles) form collective-level entities that subsequently become individuals in their own right. Recent empirical and theoretical studies advocate the importance of an externally imposed meta-population structure or \"ecological scaffold\" for the emergence of new levels of individuality. Such a scaffold enables survival and reproduction at the collective level and thus the possibility of selection for beneficial traits on that level. However, a long-standing difficulty for the ecological scaffolding approach has been its inability to adequately explain how collective-level trait values that evolved under scaffolding conditions can be retained once these conditions are lifted. We call this difficulty \"the problem of endogenisation.\" Here, we derive general conditions for the possibility of endogenisation. Key to endogenisation is the existence of a fitness valley that can be circumvented when scaffolding occurs. Using a stochastic meta-population model, we implement two versions of ecological scaffolding (one temporal and one spatial) and study subsequent evolutionary trajectories using the modelling techniques of adaptive dynamics. Our analysis yields several important results. The temporal model reveals that only collective traits based on particle-particle interactions can be endogenised when a temporary scaffold is applied to the entire population. The spatial model shows that, given the presence of an environmental gradient of externally imposed meta-population structure, ecological scaffolding can only occur in a limited \"Goldilocks\" zone of the environment. Further, if endogenisation conditions are also fulfilled, scaffolded collectives can colonise non-scaffolding areas of the environment. We conjecture that Goldilocks zones could act as initiators of ETIs and help explain the near ubiquity of collective-level individuality even if the conditions that promote it prove to be rare.",
