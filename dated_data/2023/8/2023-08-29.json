    "abstract": "Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is a routine method to non-invasively quantify perfusion dynamics in tissues. The standard practice for analyzing DCE-MRI data is to fit an ordinary differential equation to each voxel. Recent advances in data science provide an opportunity to move beyond existing methods to obtain more accurate measurements of fluid properties. Here we present localized convolutional function regression, simultaneously measuring interstitial fluid velocity, diffusion, and perfusion in 3D. We validate the method computationally and experimentally, demonstrating accurate measurement of fluid dynamics in situ and in vivo. Applying the method to human MRIs, we observe tissue-specific differences in fluid dynamics, with an increased fluid velocity in breast cancer as compared to brain cancer.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryA physics-informed computational method enables accurate and efficient measurement of fluid dynamics in individual patient tumors and demonstrates differences between tissues.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes is a global problem that threatens human health. Cell therapy methods using stem cells and tissue engineering of pancreatic islets as new therapeutic approaches have increased the chances of successful diabetes treatment. In this study, to differentiate Whartons Jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells (WJ-MSCs) into insulin-producing cells (IPCs) with improved maturity and function, platelet-rich plasma (PRP)-Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-Polycaprolactone (PCL)/PCL nanofiber scaffold was designed and used. WJ-MSCs-derived IPCs on PRP-PVP-PCL/PCL scaffold took round cluster morphology, which is the typical morphology of pancreatic islets. Real-time PCR, immunocytochemistry, and flow cytometry data showed a significant increase in pancreatic marker genes and insulin in WJ-MSCs-derived IPCs on the PRP-PVP-PCL/PCL scaffold compared to the two-dimensional (2D) experimental group. Also, using the ELISA assay, a significant increase in the secretion of insulin and C-peptide was measured in the WJ-MSCs-derived IPCs of the three-dimensional (3D) experimental group compared to the 2D experimental group, which indicated a significant improvement in the functional level of the WJ-MSCs-derived IPCs in the 3D group. The results showed that the PRP-PVP-PCL/PCL scaffold can provide an ideal microenvironment for the engineering of pancreatic islets and the generation of IPCs.",

    "abstract": "Comprehensive analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data can enhance our understanding of cellular diversity and aid in the development of personalized therapies for individuals. The abundance of missing values, known as dropouts, makes the analysis of scRNA-seq data a challenging task. Most traditional methods made assumptions about specific distributions for missing values, which limit their capability to capture the intricacy of high-dimensional scRNA-seq data. Moreover, the imputation performance of traditional methods decreases with higher missing rates. We propose a novel f -divergence based generative adversarial imputation method, called sc-f GAIN, for the scRNA-seq data imputation. Our studies identify four f -divergence functions, namely cross-entropy, Kullback-Leibler (KL), reverse KL, and Jensen-Shannon, that can be effectively integrated with the generative adversarial imputation network to generate imputed values without any assumptions, and mathematically prove that the distribution of imputed data using sc-f GAIN algorithm is same as the distribution of original data. Real scRNA-seq data analysis has shown that, compared to many traditional methods, the imputed values generated by sc-f GAIN algorithm have a smaller root-mean-square error, and it is robust to varying missing rates, moreover, it can reduce imputation bias. The flexibility offered by the f -divergence allows the sc-f GAIN method to accommodate various types of data, making it a more universal approach for imputing missing values of scRNA-seq data.",

    "abstract": "Explainable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been developed and applied to drug-protein binding prediction to identify the key chemical structures in a drug that have active interactions with the target proteins. However, the key structures identified by the current explainable GNN models are typically chemically invalid. Furthermore, a threshold needs to be manually selected to pinpoint the key structures from the rest. To overcome the limitations of the current explainable GNN models, we propose our SLGNN, which stands for using Sparse Learning to Graph Neural Networks. Our SLGNN relies on using a chemical-substructure-based graph (where nodes are chemical substructures) to represent a drug molecule. Furthermore, SLGNN incorporates generalized fussed lasso with message-passing algorithms to identify connected subgraphs that are critical for the drug-protein binding prediction. Due to the use of the chemical-substructure-based graph, it is guaranteed that any subgraphs in a drug identified by our SLGNN are chemically valid structures. These structures can be further interpreted as the key chemical structures for the drug to bind to the target protein. We demonstrate the explanatory power of our SLGNN by first showing all the key structures identified by our SLGNN are chemically valid. In addition, we illustrate that the key structures identified by our SLGNN have more predictive power than the key structures identified by the competing methods. At last, we use known drug-protein binding data to show the key structures identified by our SLGNN contain most of the binding sites.\n\nCCS CONCEPTS* Computing methodologies [-&gt;] Neural networks; Supervised learning by classification; Neural networks.\n\nACM Reference FormatYang Wang, Zanyu Shi, Timothy Richardson, Kun Huang, Pathum Weerawarna, and Yijie Wang. 2023.

    "abstract": "BackgroundGlioblastoma is a highly aggressive and malignant type of brain cancer that originates from glial cells in the brain, with a median survival time of 15 months and a 5-year survival rate of less than 5%. Regulated cell death (RCD) is the autonomous and orderly cell death under genetic control, controlled by precise signaling pathways and molecularly defined effector mechanisms, modulated by pharmacological or genetic interventions, and plays a key role in maintaining homeostasis of the internal environment. The comprehensive and systemic landscape of the RCD in glioma is not fully investigated and explored.\n\nMethodAfter collecting 18 RCD-related signatures from the opening literatures, we comprehensively explored the RCD landscape, integrating the multi-omics data, including large-scale bulk data, single-cell level data, glioma cell lines, and proteome level data. We also provided a machine learning framework for screening the potentially therapeutic candidates.\n\nResultHere, we explored RCD-related phenotypes, investigated the profile of the RCD, and developed a RCD gene pair scoring system, named RCD.GP signature. Using the machine learning framework consisting of Lasso, RSF, XgBoost, Enet, CoxBoost and Boruta, we identified seven RCD genes as potential therapeutic targets in glioma and verified the SLC43A3 by q-PCR in glioma grades and glioma cell lines.\n\nConclusionOur study provided comprehensive insights into the RCD roles in glioma, developed a robust RCD gene pair signature for predicting the prognosis of glioma patients, constructed a machine learning framework for screening the core candidates and identified the SLC43A3 as an oncogenic role and a prediction biomarker in glioblastoma.",

    "abstract": "It is estimated that approximately 15% of cancers world-wide can be linked to viral infections. The viruses that can cause or increase the risk of cancer include human papillomavirus, hepatitis B and C viruses, Epstein-Barr virus, and human immunodeficiency virus, to name a few. The computational analysis of the massive amounts of tumor DNA data, whose collection is enabled by the recent advancements in sequencing technologies, have allowed studies of the potential association between cancers and viral pathogens. However, the high diversity of oncoviral families makes reliable detection of viral DNA difficult and thus, renders such analysis challenging. In this paper, we introduce XVir, a data pipeline that relies on a transformer-based deep learning architecture to reliably identify viral DNA present in human tumors. In particular, XVir is trained on genomic sequencing reads from viral and human genomes and may be used with tumor sequence information to find evidence of viral DNA in human cancers. Results on semi-experimental data demonstrate that XVir is capable of achieving high detection accuracy, generally outperforming state-of-the-art competing methods while being more compact and less computationally demanding.\n\nCCS CONCEPTS* Computer systems organization [-&gt;] Embedded systems; Redundancy; Robotics; * Networks [-&gt;] Network reliability.\n\nACM Reference FormatShorya Consul, John Robertson, and Haris Vikalo. 2023.

    "abstract": "SNP heritability is a marked indication for genetic gains. Extreme polygenicity, i.e., small effect-size causal SNPs, dictates as many SNPs as possible to be involved in heritability estimations. On the contrary, non-causal SNPs underestimate SNP heritability levels via negative contributions which is confirmed here on simulated and real datasets. Negative contributions to heritability are biologically absurd as polymorphic genomic positions can only have null or positive contributions to heritability. This paradox signifies a trade-off between the incorporation of unknown causal SNPs and the boycott of unknown non-causal SNPs for rigorous approximations of heritability. SAFE-h2 (SNP Allocation For Estimating Heritability) is an application tool to overcome this dilemma by utilizing association p-values for SNP heritability profiling. SAFE-h2 determines an association p-value threshold to filter out SNPs from its upper-bound as they contribute negatively to heritability estimations. Considering SNP heritability estimates which were calculated using all SNPs for 74 phenotypes in five plant and four animal species, SAFE-h2 revealed up to 90 units (30 units on average) negative contribution imposed by SNPs from upper-bounds of p-value thresholds. SAFE-h2 also provides a safe p-value interval to minimize false-positive SNP hits contributions to heritability estimates. Furthermore, SAFE-h2 captures non-additive effects through intra-locus allelic adjustments. The allelic adjustment algorithm of SAFE-h2 captured additional phenotypic variance and improved the SNP heritability estimations for random phenotypes assigned to the human genotypes as well as artificial phenotypes associated, at different rates, with a biallelic locus. Likewise, SAFE-h2 revealed considerable uncaptured phenotypic variance when relying on additive effects and improved the SNP heritability estimations up to 56 units by joint analysis of intra-locus additive and non-additive allelic effects for 50 phenotypes in four animal and three plant species. We found the EMMAX algorithm to be the most stable and accurate model for SNP heritability profiling by SAFE-h2.",

    "abstract": "Light chain amyloidosis (AL) is a systemic disease where fibrillar deposition of misfolded immunoglobulin light chains (LCs) severely affects organ function and results in poor prognosis for patients, especially when heart involvement is severe. Particularly relevant in this context is the cardiotoxicity exerted by still uncharacterized soluble LC species. Here, with the final goal of identifying alternative therapeutic strategies to tackle AL amyloidosis, we produced five llama-derived nanobodies (Nbs) specific against H3, a well-characterized amyloidogenic and cardiotoxic LC from an AL patient with severe cardiac involvement. We found that Nbs are specific and potent agents capable of abolishing H3 soluble toxicity in C. elegans in vivo model. Structural characterization of H3-Nb complexes revealed that the protective effect of Nbs is related to their ability to bind to the H3 VL domain and stabilise an unexpected partially open LC dimer in which the two VL domains no longer interact with each other. Thus, while identifying potent inhibitors of LC soluble toxicity, we also describe the first non-native structure of an amyloidogenic LC that may represent a crucial step in toxicity and aggregation mechanisms.",

The {beta}1-integrin-ILK-CDC42-N-Wasp dependent cytoskeletal tension and TAZ nucleus-translocation mediate this mechano-signaling axis. As a result, expression of the stemness genes NANOG and OCT4 are induced, leading to metastatic tumor initiation. It is further demonstrated that pharmaceutical perturbation of this mechano-signaling using a novel YAP/TAZ inhibitor K975 constrains PCa metastasis in zebrafish, and development of PDX-derived organoids. Our data highlights the essential role of mechanotransduction in PCa aggressiveness, thereby underlying this pathway as a therapeutic target for future studies.",

    "abstract": "This paper aims to address the dimension reduction and classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals within the context of motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI). By leveraging modern brain signal processing tools, specifically Graph Signal Processing (GSP) and meta-heuristic techniques, we introduce the K-GLR-DE approach. This methodology encompasses functional clustering, Kron reduction, regularized common spatial patterns with generic learning (GLRCSP), and differential evolution (DE). Our approach is underpinned by a comprehensive structural-functional framework that carefully shapes the architecture of the brain graph. Edge weights are assigned based on geometric distance and correlation, imbuing the model with physiologically meaningful connectivity patterns. Graph reduction involves strategically employing physiological regions of interest (ROIs) and Kron reduction to select informative subgraphs while preserving vital information from all graph vertices. Feature extraction integrates total variation calculation and the GLRCSP method, followed by dimension reduction using the DE algorithm. The extracted features are then evaluated using well-established machine-learning classifiers. The validation process is carried out using Dataset IVa from BCI Competition III, providing a tangible benchmark for the performance of the K-GLR-DE approach. Significantly, the SVM-RBF classifier stands out as the top performer, achieving a remarkable average accuracy of 96.46{+/-}0.83. Noteworthy is our approachs capacity to notably augment MI-BCI classification performance across diverse training trial scenarios, encompassing limited, small, and conventional settings.",

    "abstract": "Animals, including humans, rely on contextual information to interpret ambiguous stimuli. Impaired context processing is a hallmark of several neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, autism, PTSD, and addiction. While sex differences in the prevalence and manifestations of these disorders are well established, potential sex differences in context processing remain uncertain. Here we examined sex differences in the contextual control over cue-evoked reward seeking and its neural correlates, in rats. Male and female rats were trained in a bidirectional occasion-setting preparation in which the validity of two reward-predictive cues was informed by the presence, or absence, of a background contextual feature (A:X+ / X- / A:Y- / Y+). Females were significantly slower to acquire contextual control over cue-evoked reward seeking. However, once established, the contextual control over behavior was more robust in female rats; it showed less within-session variability (less influence of prior reward) and greater resistance to acute stress. This superior contextual control achieved by females was accompanied by an increased activation of the orbitofrontal cortex compared to males. Critically, these behavioral and neural sex differences were specific to the contextual modulation process and not observed in simple, context-independent, reward prediction tasks. These results indicate a sex-biased trade-off between speed and robustness in the acquisition of contextual modulation. The different distribution of sexes along the Fast{leftrightarrow}Steady continuum might reflect different levels of engagement of the orbitofrontal cortex, and might have implications for our understanding of sex differences in psychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "In primates, the putamen and the caudate nucleus are connected by [~]1mm-thick caudolenticular gray matter bridges (CLGBs) interspersed between the white matter bundles of the internal capsule. Little is understood about the functional or microstructural properties of the CLGBs. In studies proposing high resolution diffusion magnetic resolution imaging (dMRI) techniques, CLGBs have been qualitatively identified as an example of superior imaging quality, however, the microstructural properties of these structures have yet to be examined. In this study, it is demonstrated for the first time that diffusion MRI is sensitive to an organized anisotropic signal corresponding to the CLGBs, suggesting that diffusion MRI could be a useful imaging method for probing the unknown microstructure of the CLGBs. In addition, a novel tractography algorithm is proposed that utilizes the shape of the human striatum (putamen + caudate nucleus) to reconstruct the CLGBs in 3D. The method is applied to three publicly available diffusion imaging datasets varying in quality and thereafter demonstrating that the reconstructed CLGBs directly overlap expected gray matter regions in the human brain. In addition, the method is shown to accurately reconstruct CLGBs repeatedly across multiple test-retest cohorts. Finally, by using the CLGB reconstructions and a local model of the diffusion signal, a method is proposed to extract a quantitative measurement of microstructure from the CLGBs themselves. This is the first work to comprehensively study the CLGBs in-vivo using diffusion MRI and presents techniques suitable for future human neuroscience studies targeting these structures.",

We also performed perfusion-based multi-echo, Hadamard encoded multi-delay arterial spin labeling (ASL) to evaluate whole brain cortical cerebral blood flow (CBF) and transendothelial exchange (Tex) of water from the vasculature into the perivascular space and parenchyma. Both methods were used in young adults (N=9, 6F, 23{+/-}3 years old) in the setting of sleep and sleep deprivation. To study aging, 10 older adults, (6F, 67{+/-}3 years old) were imaged after a night of normal sleep only and compared with the young adults. D* in SAS was significantly (p<0.05) lesser after sleep deprivation (0.014{+/-}0.001 mm2/s) than after normal sleep (0.016{+/-}0.001 mm2/s), but was unchanged with aging. Cortical CBF and Tex on the other hand, were unchanged after sleep deprivation but were significantly lower in older adults (37{+/-}3 ml/100g/min, 476{+/-}66 ms) than young adults (42{+/-}2 ml/100g/min, 624{+/-}66 ms).

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal, rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor neurons, that overlaps significantly with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Most cases are sporadic (90%) with undefined aetiology, but pathological forms of TAR-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), involving its misfolding, aggregation and mislocalisation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, are present in motor neurons in almost all cases (97%) and [~]45% FTD cases. Actin is the most abundant protein in eukaryotic cells, with structural roles in the cytoskeleton and diverse signalling functions. This includes neuronal-specific roles in dendritic spines, synapses, axonal growth cones, and plasticity. Actin is in constant dynamic equilibrium between two forms: free monomeric, globular actin (G-actin) and polymeric, filamentous actin (F-actin). Actin dynamics is regulated by several key actin-binding proteins, including tropomyosin 4.2 (Tpm4.2) and cofilin, which depolymerises actin filaments. Cofilin is activated by phosphorylation at Ser3 via LIM domain kinase1/2 (LIMK1/2), which is also regulated by phosphorylation via Rac1/cdc42. Here we demonstrate that actin dynamics is closely associated with pathological TDP-43 in ALS. More F-actin relative to G-actin was detected in lumbar spinal cords from both sporadic ALS patients and a mouse model displaying TDP-43 pathology (rNLS), and in neuronal cells expressing cytoplasmic TDP-43. Hence actin dynamics is dysregulated in sporadic ALS, resulting in more actin polymerization. We also detected increased levels of Tpm 4.2, Rac1/cdc42, and increased phosphorylation of both LIMK1/2 and cofilin, in sporadic ALS patients. TDP-43 also physically interacted with actin in vitro and in cell lysates, providing additional insights into actin dysregulation in ALS. rNLS mice display motor neuron loss and key ALS/MND behavioural phenotypes, and increased cofilin phosphorylation was also detected in these animals at symptom onset, implying that actin dynamics actively contributes to neurodegeneration. Moreover, pharmacological induction of actin polymerization produced features typical of pathological TDP-43 (cytoplasmic mis-localisation and formation of inclusions and stress granules) implying that actin dysregulation contributes to TDP-43 pathology in ALS. Importantly, we also detected more cofilin phosphorylation in spinal motor neurons from sporadic patients compared to healthy controls, revealing that our observations are clinically relevant and present in the relevant cell type. This study therefore identifies dysregulated actin dynamics as a novel disease mechanism associated with TDP-43 pathology and hence most ALS cases. It also implies that regulating cofilin or LIMK1/2 phosphorylation may be a novel therapeutic strategy in ALS, FTD and other diseases involving TDP-43 pathology.",

    "abstract": "Several midbrain nuclei degenerate in Parkinsons Disease (PD). Many of these nuclei share the common characteristics that are thought to contribute to their selective vulnerability, including pacemaking activity and high levels of calcium influx. In addition to the well-characterized dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), the cholinergic neurons of the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) also degenerate in PD. It is well established that the low-threshold L-type calcium current is a main contributor to tonic calcium in SNc dopaminergic neurons and is hypothesized to contribute to their selective vulnerability. However, it is not yet clear whether the vulnerable PPN cholinergic neurons share this property. Therefore, we used two-photon dendritic calcium imaging and whole-cell electrophysiology to evaluate the role of L-type calcium channels in the tonic and phasic activity of PPN neurons and the corresponding dendritic calcium signal and directly compare these characteristics to SNc neurons. We found that blocking L-type channels reduces tonic firing rate and dendritic calcium levels in SNc neurons. By contrast, the calcium load in PPN neurons during pacemaking did not depend on L-type channels. However, we find that blocking L-type channels reduces phasic calcium influx in PPN dendrites. Together, these findings show that L-type calcium channels play different roles in the activity of SNc and PPN neurons, and suggest that low-threshold L-type channels are not responsible for tonic calcium levels in PPN cholinergic neurons and are therefore not likely to be a source of selective vulnerability in these cells.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal differentiation is regulated by neuronal activity. Here, we analyzed dendritic and axonal growth of Basket cells and non-Basket cells using sparse transfection of channelrhodopsin-YFP and repetitive optogenetic stimulation in slice cultures of rat visual cortex. Neocortical interneurons often display axon-carrying dendrites (AcDs). We found that the AcDs of Basket cells and non-Basket cells were on average their most complex dendrite. Further, the AcD configuration had an influence on Basket cell axonal development. Axons originating from an AcD formed denser arborizations with more terminal endings within the dendritic field of the parent cell. Intriguingly, this occurred already in unstimulated Basket cells, and complexity was not increased further by optogenetic stimulation. However, optogenetic stimulation exerted a growth-promoting effect on axons emerging from Basket cell somata. The axons of non-Basket cells neither responded to the AcD configuration nor to the optogenetic stimulation. The results suggest that the formation of locally dense Basket cell plexuses is regulated by spontaneous activity. Moreover, in the AcD configuration, the AcD and the axon it carries mutually support each others growth.\n\nTeaserTextbooks usually draw cortical neurons with axons emerging from the cell body. Axons emerging from dendrites have been considered a caprice of nature until recent work demonstrated that axon-carrying dendrites are neither a rare nor a random phenomenon. Rather, this morphological configuration awards specific functional properties. Here, we discovered a morphogenetic role of the AcD configuration in developing Basket neurons which deliver axo-somatic inhibition to pyramidal neurons. Driven by spontaneous activity, AcD and the axon mutually promote each others growth such that the axon rapidly forms a denser presynaptic terminal field. Basket cells with axons from the cell body achieve the same complexity with technical assistance via an optogenetic stimulation. This way, a dendritic origin accelerates Basket cell axonal development.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundProcessing stroke magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain data can be susceptible to lesion-based abnormalities. In this study we developed and validated the Lesion Aware automated Processing Pipeline (LeAPP) that incorporates mitigation measures, improving volumetric and connectomics outputs compared to current standards in automated MRI processing pipelines.\n\nMethodsBuilding upon the Human Connectome Project (HCP) minimal processing pipeline, we introduced correction measures, such as cost-function masking and virtual brain transplant, and extended functional and diffusion processing to match acquisition protocols often found in a clinical context. A total of 51 participants (36 stroke patients (65.7{+/-}12.96 years, 18 female) and 15 healthy controls (69.2{+/-}7.4 years, 7 female)) were processed across four time points for patients (3-5, 30-40, 85-95, 340-380 days after stroke onset) and one time point for controls. Artificially lesioned brains (N=82), derived from healthy brains and informed by real stroke lesions were created, thus generating ground-truth data for validation. The processing pipeline and validation framework are available as containerized open-source software. Reconstruction quality has been quantified on whole brain level and for lesion affected and unaffected regions-of-interest (ROIs) using metrics like dice score, volume difference and center-of-gravity distance. Global and local level connectome reconstruction was assessed using node strength, node centrality and clustering coefficient.\n\nResultsThe new pipeline LeAPP provides close reconstructions of the ground truth. Deviations in reconstructed averaged whole brain node strength and all ROI based volume and connectome metrics were significantly reduced compared to the HCP pipeline without stroke specific mitigation measures.\n\nConclusionsLeAPP improves reconstruction quality of multimodal MRI processing for brain parcellation and structural connectome estimation significantly over the non-adapted HCP in the presence of lesions and provides a robust framework for diffusion and functional image processing of clinical stroke data.

    "abstract": "Laboratory model organisms have provided a window into how the immune system functions. An increasing body of evidence, however, suggests that the immune responses of naive laboratory animals may differ substantially to those of their wild counterparts. Past exposure, environmental challenges and physiological condition may all impact on immune responsiveness. Chronic infections of soil-transmitted helminths impose significant health burdens on humans, livestock and wildlife, with limited treatment success. In laboratory mice, Th1 versus Th2 immune polarisation is the major determinant of helminth infection outcome. Here we compared antigen-specific immune responses to the soil-transmitted whipworm Trichuris muris between controlled laboratory and wild free-ranging populations of house mice (Mus musculus domesticus). Wild mice harbouring chronic, low-level infections produced lower levels of cytokines in response to Trichuris antigen than laboratory-housed C57BL/6 mice. Wild mouse effector/memory CD4+ T cell phenotype reflected the antigen-specific cytokine response across the Th1/Th2 spectrum. Increasing worm burden was associated with body condition loss. However, local Trichuris-specific Th1/Th2 balance was positively associated with worm burden only in older wild mice. Thus, although the fundamental relationships between the CD4+ T helper cell response and resistance to T. muris infection are similar in both laboratory and wild M.m.domesticus, there are quantitative differences and age-specific effects that are analogous to human immune responses. These context-dependent immune responses demonstrate the fundamental importance of understanding the differences between model and natural systems for translating mechanistic models to  real world immune function.",

Although exercise is suggested as a lifestyle intervention to manage various chronic illnesses, it negatively affects people with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), who suffer from exercise intolerance. We hypothesized that altered extracellular vesicle (EV) signaling in ME/CFS patients after an exercise challenge may contribute to their prolonged and exacerbated negative response to exertion (post-exertional malaise). EVs were isolated by size exclusion chromatography from the plasma of 18 female ME/CFS patients and 17 age- and BMI-matched female sedentary controls at three time points: before, 15 minutes, and 24 hours after a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test. EVs were characterized using nanoparticle tracking analysis and their protein cargo was quantified using Tandem Mass Tag-based (TMT) proteomics. The results show that exercise affects the EV proteome in ME/CFS patients differently than in healthy individuals and that changes in EV proteins after exercise are strongly correlated with symptom severity in ME/CFS. Differentially abundant proteins in ME/CFS patients vs. controls were involved in many pathways and systems, including coagulation processes, muscle contraction (both smooth and skeletal muscle), cytoskeletal proteins, the immune system, and brain signaling.",

On the other hand, for neutral species, competing equally for a single resource, diversity reflects a balance between the rate of introduction of novelty (for example by immigration or speciation) and the rate of extinction. Recent models of microbial metabolism have identified scenarios where metabolic trade-offs among species partitioning multiple resources can produce emergent neutral-like dynamics. In this hybrid scenario, one might expect that both resource diversity and immigration will act to boost species diversity. Surprisingly, though, we show that the reverse may be true: when metabolic trade-offs hold and population sizes are sufficiently large, increasing resource diversity can act to reduce species diversity. This reversal is explained by a generic transition between neutral- and niche-like dynamics, driven by the diversity of resources. The inverted resource-diversity relationship that results may be a signature of consumer-resource systems exhibiting strong metabolic trade-offs.",

    "abstract": "A species tree is a central concept in evolutionary biology whereby a single branching phylogeny reflects relationships among species. However, the phylogenies of different genomic regions often differ from the species tree. Although tree discordance is often widespread in phylogenomic studies, we still lack a clear understanding of how variation in phylogenetic patterns is shaped by genome biology or the extent to which discordance may compromise comparative studies. We characterized patterns of phylogenomic discordance across the murine rodents (Old World mice and rats) - a large and ecologically diverse group that gave rise to the mouse and rat model systems. Combining new linked-read genome assemblies for seven murine species with eleven published rodent genomes, we first used ultra-conserved elements (UCEs) to infer a robust species tree. We then used whole genomes to examine finer-scale patterns of discordance and found that phylogenies built from proximate chromosomal regions had similar phylogenies. However, there was no relationship between tree similarity and local recombination rates in house mice, suggesting that genetic linkage influences phylogenetic patterns over deeper timescales. This signal may be independent of contemporary recombination landscapes. We also detected a strong influence of linked selection whereby purifying selection at UCEs led to less discordance, while genes experiencing positive selection showed more discordant and variable phylogenetic signals. Finally, we show that assuming a single species tree can result in high error rates when testing for positive selection under different models. Collectively, our results highlight the complex relationship between phylogenetic inference and genome biology and underscore how failure to account for this complexity can mislead comparative genomic studies.",

    "abstract": "Genomes of aphids (family Aphididae) show several unusual evolutionary patterns. In particular, within the XO sex determination system of aphids, the X chromosome exhibits a lower rate of interchromosomal rearrangements, fewer highly expressed genes, and faster evolution at nonsynonymous sites compared to the autosomes. In contrast, other hemipteran lineages have similar rates of interchromosomal rearrangement for autosomes and X chromosomes. One possible explanation for these differences is the aphids life cycle of cyclical parthenogenesis, where multiple asexual generations alternate with one sexual generation. If true, we should see similar features in the genomes of Phylloxeridae, an outgroup of aphids which also undergoes cyclical parthenogenesis. To investigate this, we generated a chromosome-level assembly for the grape phylloxera, an agriculturally important species of Phylloxeridae, and identified its single X chromosome. We then performed synteny analysis using the phylloxerid genome and 30 high-quality genomes of aphids and other hemipteran species. Unexpectedly, we found that the phylloxera does not share aphids patterns of chromosome evolution. By estimating interchromosomal rearrangement rates on an absolute time scale, we found that rates are elevated for aphid autosomes compared to their X chromosomes, but this pattern does not extend to the phylloxera branch. Potentially, the conservation of X chromosome gene content is due to selection on XO males that appear in the sexual generation. We also examined gene duplication patterns across Hemiptera and uncovered horizontal gene transfer events contributing to phylloxera evolution.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the contribution of a candidate gene, fiz (fezzik), to complex polygenic adaptation to juvenile malnutrition in Drosophila melanogaster. We show that experimental populations adapted during >250 generations of experimental evolution to a nutritionally poor larval diet (Selected populations) evolved several-fold lower fiz expression compared to unselected Control populations. This divergence in fiz expression is mediated by a cis-regulatory polymorphism. This polymorphism, which was originally present in a sample from a natural population in Switzerland, is distinct from a second cis-regulatory SNP previously identified in non-African D. melanogaster populations, implying that two independent cis-regulatory variants promoting high fiz expression segregate in non-African populations. Enzymatic analyses of Fiz protein expressed in E. coli demonstrate that it has ecdysone oxidase activity acting on both ecdysone and 20-hydroxyecdysone. Four of five fiz paralogs annotated to ecdysteroid metabolism also show reduced expression in Selected larvae, suggesting that malnutrition-driven selection favored general downregulation of ecdysone oxidases. Finally, as an independent test of the role of fiz in poor diet adaptation, we show that fiz knockdown by RNAi results in faster larval growth on the poor diet, but at the cost of greatly reduced survival. These results imply that downregulation of fiz in Selected populations was favored because of its role in suppressing growth in response to nutrient shortage. However, fiz downregulation is only adaptive in combination with other changes evolved by Selected populations, such as in nutrient acquisition and metabolism, which ensure that the organism can actually sustain the faster growth promoted by fiz downregulation.",

    "abstract": "Animals regularly experience stressful situations, ranging from predation to social stress, yet successfully deal with them on most occasions. This adaptive mechanism, coping, reduces the adverse effects of stressors through behavioural and physiological efforts, failing to which may result in reduced fitness. However, considerable variation in coping is observed. Unlike in humans, coping is often considered a personality trait in non-human animals due to construct similarity, resulting in conceptual ambiguity. Besides, limited multidisciplinary research has rendered comprehending the drivers of coping in animals challenging. We assessed repetitive behavioural coping or coping styles (n=30), emotional arousal (n=12), and consistent inter-individual differences, i.e., personalities (n=32) of long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) using observations, ecologically relevant experiments, and infrared thermography. We finally investigated the association of coping with a Valine/Methionine polymorphism encoded by the Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene (n=26), which is widely known for its involvement in human stress regulation. Our findings suggest that personality and the presence of the human equivalent COMT Val158Met polymorphism in long-tailed macaques are associated with  emotion-focused and  problem-focused coping styles. These coping styles were consistent with emotional arousal as measured with infrared thermography. We discuss these proximate drivers of coping for a better understanding of its evolution in primates.",

Recent cryo-EM structures of TRAP transporters provide a broad framework to understand how they work, but the mechanistic details of transport are not yet defined. Here we report the cryo-EM structure of the Haemophilus influenzae N-acetylneuraminate TRAP transporter (HiSiaQM) at 2.99 [A] resolution (extending to 2.2 [A] at the core), revealing new features. The improved resolution (the previous HiSiaQM structure is 4.7 [A] resolution) permits accurate assignment of two Na+ sites and the architecture of the substrate binding site, consistent with mutagenic and functional data. Moreover, rather than a monomer, the HiSiaQM structure is a homodimer. We observe lipids at the dimer interface, as well as a lipid trapped within the fusion that links the SiaQ and SiaM subunits. We show that the affinity (KD) for the complex between the soluble HiSiaP protein and HiSiaQM is in the micromolar range and that a related SiaP can bind HiSiaQM, highlighting features of the complex interface.

    "abstract": "BackgroundRepresentation learning models have become a mainstay of modern genomics. These models are trained to yield vector representations, or embeddings, of various biological entities, such as cells, genes, individuals, or genomic regions. Recent applications of unsupervised embedding approaches have been shown to learn relationships among genomic regions that define functional elements in a genome. Unsupervised representation learning of genomic regions is free of the supervision from curated metadata and can condense rich biological knowledge from publicly available data to region embeddings. However, there exists no method for evaluating the quality of these embeddings in the absence of metadata, making it difficult to assess the reliability of analyses based on the embeddings, and to tune model training to yield optimal results.\n\nMethodsTo bridge this gap, we propose four evaluation metrics: the cluster tendency test (CTT), the reconstruction test (RCT), the genome distance scaling test (GDST), and the neighborhood preserving test (NPT). The CTT and RCT are statistical methods that evaluate how well region embeddings can be clustered and how much the embeddings can preserve the information contained in training data. The GDST and NPT exploit the biological tendency of regions close in genomic space to have similar biological functions; they measure how much such information is captured by individual region embeddings and a set of region embeddings.\n\nResultsWe demonstrate the utility of these statistical and biological tests for evaluating unsupervised genomic region embeddings and provide guidelines for learning reliable embeddings.\n\nAvailabilityCode is available at https://github.com/databio/geniml.",

    "abstract": "Advances in metagenome sequencing data continue to enable new methods for analyzing biological systems. When handling microbial profile data, metagenome sequencing has proven to be far more comprehensive than traditional methods such as 16s rRNA data, which rely on partial sequences. Microbial community profiling can be used to obtain key biological signals that pave the way for better and accurate understanding of complex systems that are critical for advancing biomedical research and healthcare. There have been few attempts to uncover microbial community associations with certain health conditions. However, such attempts have mostly used partial or incomplete data to accurately capture those associations. This study introduces a novel computational approach for the identification of co-occurring microbial communities using the abundance and functional roles of species-level microbiome data. The proposed approach is then used to identify signature pathways associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Furthermore, we developed a computational pipeline to identify microbial species co-occurrences from metagenome data. When comparing IBD to a control group, we show that co-occurring communities of species are enriched for potential pathways. We also show that the identified co-occurring microbial species operate as a community to facilitate pathway enrichment. The obtained findings suggest that the proposed network model, along with the computational pipeline, provide a valuable analytical tool to analyze complex biological systems and extract pathway signatures that classify or diagnose certain health conditions.\n\nCCS CONCEPTS* Applied computing [-&gt;] Biological networks; Bioinformatics; Systems biology.\n\nACM Reference FormatSuyeon Kim, Ishwor Thapa, and Hesham Ali. 2023.

    "abstract": "In biological systems, proteins can bind to nanoparticles to form a \"corona\" of adsorbed molecules. The nanoparticle corona is of high interest because it impacts the organisms response to the nanomaterial. Understanding the corona requires knowledge of protein structure, orientation, and dynamics at the surface. Ultimately, a residue-level mapping of protein behavior on nanoparticle surfaces is needed, but this mapping is difficult to obtain with traditional approaches. Here, we have investigated the interaction between R2ab and polystyrene nanoparticles (PSNPs) at the level of individual residues. R2ab is a bacterial surface protein from Staphylococcus epidermidis and is known to interact strongly with polystyrene, leading to biofilm formation. We have used mass spectrometry after lysine methylation and hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) NMR spectroscopy to understand how the R2ab protein interacts with PSNPs of different sizes. Through lysine methylation, we observe subtle but statistically significant changes in methylation patterns in the presence of PSNPs, indicating altered protein surface accessibility. HDX measurements reveal that certain regions of the R2ab protein undergo faster exchange rates in the presence of PSNPs, suggesting conformational changes upon binding. Both results support a recently proposed \"adsorbotope\" model, wherein adsorbed proteins consist of unfolded anchor points interspersed with regions of partial structure. Our data also highlight the challenges of characterizing complex protein-nanoparticle interactions using these techniques, such as fast exchange rates. While providing insights into how proteins respond to nanoparticle surfaces, this research emphasizes the need for advanced methods to comprehend these intricate interactions fully at the residue level.\n\nTOC Image\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=97 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/554951v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (38K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@149171org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@58b8bcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c86cfaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6ace02_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Lysine methylation and hydrogen-deuterium exchange can reveal useful structural details about protein adsorption to nanoparticle surfaces.",

    "abstract": "The computational prediction of the viscosity of dense protein solutions is highly desirable, for example in the early development phase of high-concentration biophar-maceutical formulations where the material needed for experimental determination is typically limited. Here, we use large-scale atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with explicit solvent to de novo predict the dynamic viscosities of solutions of a monoclonal IgG1 antibody (mAb) from the pressure fluctuations using a Green-Kubo approach. The viscosities at simulated mAb concentrations of 200 mg/ml and 250 mg/ml are compared to the experimental values, which we measured with rotational rheometry. The computational viscosity of 24 mPa s at a mAb concentration of 250 mg/ml matches the experimental value of 23 mPa s obtained at a concentration of 213 mg/ml, indicating slightly different effective concentrations (or activities) in the MD simulations and in the experiments. This difference is assigned to a slight underestimation of the effective mAb-mAb interactions in the simulations, leading to a too loose dynamic mAb network that governs the viscosity. Taken together, the present study demonstrates the feasibility of all-atom MD simulations for predicting the properties of dense mAb solutions and provides detailed microscopic insights into the underlying molecular interactions. At the same time, it also shows that there is room for further improvements and highlights challenges, such as the massive sampling required for computing collective properties of dense biomolecular solutions in the high-viscosity regime with reasonable statistical precision.\n\nTOC Graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=110 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/555069v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (37K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13a6d19org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d0a9deorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1403b92org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@72c6e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Early detection is challenging due to the absence of symptoms in the early stages. The complexity and molecular diversity of HCC contribute to its poor prognosis. Understanding its molecular subtypes and mechanisms is crucial for improved management.\n\nMethodsThe study utilized publicly available data to investigate the potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) based on their transcript per million (TPM) expression levels.

Worker bees have different tasks in the hive including gathering of food, its processing, caring for brood, protecting the hive, produce wax, nourish workers, drones and queen. Drones are male bees whose only role is to mate with a virgin queen. Many studies have dealt with physiology, behavior, morphology of workers and drones. This is the first study that compared differences in element accumulation and composition between workers and drones honey bees. It was observed that worker honey bees have higher concentration, from 116 % to 517 %, of most elements analyzed. Drones had higher concentration of essential elements to bees, Na, Mg, P, S, K, Zn, Cu and especially Se which was 2.2-fold higher. These differences can be attributed to environmental exposure; reproductive role of drones, high Se in sperm; but mostly to the food workers and drones eat. Worker bees feed on unprocessed food, mostly pollen, which is rich in minerals. Drones are fed by worker bees pre-processed food. Here we show that worker honey bees have a filtering mechanism that enables them to accumulate non-essential elements and not pass them on through the processed food to drones or larva.",

    "abstract": "In multiple sclerosis (MS), microglia and macrophages within the central nervous system (CNS) play an important role in determining the balance between myelin repair and demyelination/neurodegeneration. Phagocytic and regenerative functions of these CNS innate immune cells support remyelination, whereas chronic and maladaptive inflammatory activation promotes lesion expansion and disability, particularly in the progressive forms of MS. No currently approved drugs convincingly target microglia and macrophages within the CNS, contributing to the critical lack of therapies promoting remyelination and slowing progression in MS. Here, we found that the protein kinase C (PKC)-modulating drug bryostatin-1 (bryo-1), a CNS-penetrant compound with an established human safety profile, produces a shift in microglia and CNS macrophage transcriptional programs from pro-inflammatory to regenerative phenotypes, both in vitro and in vivo. Treatment of microglia with bryo-1 prevented the activation of neurotoxic astrocytes while stimulating scavenger pathways, phagocytosis, and secretion of factors that promote oligodendrocyte differentiation. In line with these findings, systemic treatment with bryo-1 augmented remyelination following a focal demyelinating injury in vivo. Our results demonstrate the potential of bryo-1 and functionally related PKC modulators as myelin regenerative and neuroprotective agents in MS and other neurologic diseases through therapeutic targeting of microglia and CNS-associated macrophages.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryPKC modulation in CNS innate immune cells favors the activation of a beneficial phenotype that promotes myelin regeneration and neuroprotection.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinsons disease (PD), pathomechanisms such as aberrant network dysfunctions can be elucidated by conducting multiscale explorations in animal models. However, the lack of specificity in the existing models limits a restricted targeting of individual network elements and characterization of PD as a \"circuitopathy\". We therefore developed a cell-type specific viral vector (AAV2/9-CreON-A53T-Syn) mouse model that allows to induce synucleinopathy within individual circuit elements in vivo. When specifically targeted to dopaminergic (DA) neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), our approach recapitulates the main hallmarks of the disease, namely Lewy-body-like aggregation, progressive cellular and nigrostriatal projections loss, together with locomotor impairment. Our strategy is supported by new state-of-the-art analytical approaches for cell quantification and behavior characterization. Altogether, we provide a novel model of synucleinopathy, which offers new opportunities to study the contribution of individual network elements to disease pathomechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Psychological stress confers an increased risk for several diseases including psychiatric conditions. The susceptibility to psychological stress is modulated by various factors, many of them being modifiable lifestyle choices. The ketogenic diet (KD) has emerged as a dietary regime that offers positive outcomes on mood and health status. Psychological stress and elevated inflammation are common features of neuropsychiatric disorders such as certain types of major depressive disorder. KD has been attributed anti-inflammatory properties that could underlie its beneficial consequences on the brain and behavior. Microglia are the main drivers of inflammation in the central nervous system. They are known to respond to both dietary changes and psychological stress, notably by modifying their production of cytokines and relationships among the brain parenchyma. To assess the interactions between KD and the stress response, including effects on microglia, we examined adult male mice on control diet (CD) versus KD that underwent 10 days of repeated social defeat (RSD) or remained non-stressed (controls; CTRLs). Through a social interaction test, stressed mice were classified as susceptible (SUS) or resistant (RES) to RSD. The mouse population fed a KD tended to have a higher proportion of individuals classified as RES following RSD. Microglial morphology and ultrastructure were then analyzed in the ventral hippocampus CA1, a brain region known to present structural alterations as a response to psychological stress. Distinct changes in microglial soma and arborization linked to the KD, SUS and RES phenotypes were revealed. Ultrastructural analysis by electron microscopy showed a clear reduction of cellular stress markers in microglia from KD fed animals. Furthermore, ultrastructural analysis showed that microglial contacts with synaptic elements were reduced in the SUS compared to the RES and CTRL groups. Hippocampal lipidomic analyses lastly identified a distinct lipid profile in SUS animals compared to CTRLs. These key differences, combined with the distinct microglial responses to diet and stress, indicate that unique metabolic changes may underlie the stress susceptibility phenotypes. Altogether, our results reveal novel mechanisms by which a KD might improve the resistance to psychological stress.\n\nHighlightsO_LIKetogenic diet tends to promote resistance to psychological stress\nC_LIO_LIHippocampal microglia show morphological adaptations to stress and diet\nC_LIO_LIMicroglia of stress-susceptible mice make less synaptic contacts\nC_LIO_LIMicroglia of ketogenic diet-fed mice show less signs of cellular stress\nC_LIO_LILipids are differentially regulated in the hippocampi of susceptible mice\nC_LI",

Rem2 has been implicated in Huntingtons disease and Long QT Syndrome and is highly expressed in the brain and in endocrine cells. In this study, we examined the evolutionary history of Rem2 across mammals, focusing on the role of purifying selection and epistasis in shaping its sequence and structure. In our analysis of Rem2 sequences across 175 mammalian species, we found evidence for strong purifying selection in 70% of non-invariant codon sites of the protein, characteristic of essential proteins that play critical roles in biological processes and is consistent with Rem2s role in the regulation of neuronal development and function. We inferred epistatic effects in 49 pairs of coevolving codon sites in Rem2, some of which are predicted to have deleterious effects on human health. Additionally, we reconstructed the ancestral evolutionary history of mammalian Rem2 using protein structure prediction of extinct and extant sequences. This analysis revealed the dynamics of how substitutions that change the genetic distance of Rem2 can impact protein structure in variable regions while maintaining core functional mechanisms. By understanding the selective pressures, protein- and genetic-interactions that have shaped the sequence and structure of the Rem2 protein, we may gain a stronger understanding of its biological and functional constraints.",

Current treatments are ineffective for a significant fraction of patients, underscoring the need for new medical therapies with long-term benefits. Given the genetic correlation between migraines and endometriosis, we sought evidence for the role of CGRP-mediated neuroimmune communication in endometriosis. We found that mouse and human endometriosis lesions contained CGRP and RAMP1. In mice, nociceptor ablation reduced pain, monocyte recruitment, and lesion size, suggesting that nociceptors support endometriosis lesions. In vitro, CGRP-treated macrophages showed impaired efferocytosis and supported endometrial cell growth in a RAMP1-dependent manner. Treatment with FDA-approved drugs that block CGRP-RAMP1 signaling reduced evoked and spontaneous pain, and lesion size. Since the lack of drug efficacy at reducing ongoing pain drives most endometriosis therapy failure, our data demonstrating effectiveness of non-hormonal and non-opioid CGRP/RAMP1 blocking therapies may lead to clinical benefit for endometriosis patients.",

    "abstract": "The loss of upper and lower motor neurons, and their axons is central to the loss of motor function and death in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Due to the diverse range of genetic and environmental factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of ALS, there have been difficulties in developing effective therapies for ALS. One dichotomy emerging in the field is that protection of the neuronal cell soma itself does not prevent axonal vulnerability and degeneration, suggesting the need for targeted therapeutics to prevent axon degeneration. Post-translational modifications of protein acetylation can alter the function, stability and half-life of individual proteins, and can be enzymatically modified by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetyltransferases (HDACs), which add, or remove acetyl groups, respectively. Maintenance of post-translational microtubule acetylation has been suggested as a potential mechanism to stabilise axons and prevent axonal loss and neurodegeneration in ALS. This study has utilized an orally dosed HDAC6 specific inhibitor, ACY-738, prevent deacetylation and stabilize microtubules in the mSOD1G93A mouse model of ALS. Furthermore, co-treatment with riluzole was performed to determine any effects or drug interactions and potentially enhance preclinical research translation. This study shows ACY-738 treatment increased acetylation of microtubules in the spinal cord of mSOD1G93A mice, reduced lower motor neuron degeneration in the lumbar spinal cord of female mice, ameliorated reduction in peripheral nerve axon puncta size, but did not prevent overt motor function decline. The current study also shows peripheral nerve axon puncta size to be partially restored after treatment with riluzole and highlights the importance of co-treatment to measure the potential effects of therapeutics in ALS.\n\nHighlightsO_LIACY-738 inhibits HDAC6 and leads to increased microtubule acetylation in spinal cord of mSOD1G93A mice.\nC_LIO_LIACY-738 treatment reduces lower motor neuron degeneration in the lumbar spinal cord of mSOD1G93A mice.\nC_LIO_LIACY-738 treatment restores peripheral nerve axon puncta size of mSOD1G93A mice.\nC_LIO_LIACY-738 treatment does not prevent overt motor function decline mSOD1G93A mice.\nC_LIO_LIRiluzole treatment partially restores peripheral nerve axon puncta size in mSOD1G93A mice.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Genome studies of fungal pathogens have presented evidence for exceptionally high rates of evolution. It has been proposed that rapid adaptation is a hallmark of pathogen evolution that facilitates the invasion of new host niches and the overcoming of intervention strategies such as fungicide applications and drug treatments. To which extent high levels of genetic variation within and between species correlate with adaptive protein evolution in fungi more generally has so far not been explored. In this study, we addressed the contribution of adaptive evolution relative to genetic drift in 20 fungal species, hereby exploring genetic variation in 2,478 fungal genomes. We reannotated positions of protein-coding genes to obtain a high-quality dataset of 234,427 full-length core gene and 25,612 accessory gene alignments. We applied an extension of the McDonald-Kreitman test that models the distributions of fitness effects to infer the rate of adaptive ({omega}A) and non-adaptive ({omega}NA) non-synonymous substitutions in protein-coding genes. To explore the relevance of recombination on local adaptation rates, we inferred the population genomic recombination rate for all 20 species. Our analyses reveal extensive variation in rates of adaptation and show that high rates of adaptation are not a hallmark of a pathogenic lifestyle. Up to 83% of non-synonymous substitutions are adaptive in the species Parastagonospora nodorum. However, non-synonymous substitutions in other species, including the prominent rice-infecting pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae, are predominantly non-adaptive (neutral or slightly deleterious). Correlating adaptation measures with effective population size and recombination rate, we show that effective population size is a primary determinant of adaptive evolution in fungi. At the genome scale, recombination rate variation explains variation in both {omega}A and {omega}NA. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our estimates using simulations. We underline the value of population genetic principles in studies of fungal evolution, and we highlight the importance of demographic processes in adaptive evolution of pathogenic and non-pathogenic species.",

We show that ClipperQTL performs as well as FastQTL and runs about 500 times faster if the contrastive strategy is used and 50 times faster if the conventional permutation-based approach is used.

    "abstract": "Measurement of mechanical forces of cell-cell interactions is important for studying the emergence of diverse three-dimensional morphologies of multicellular organisms. We previously reported an image-based statistical method for inferring the effective mechanical potentials of pairwise cell-cell interactions, where cell tracking data obtained by live imaging was fitted by a theoretical model. However, because real tissues harbor various non-cellular components such as expanding cavities, whether the image-based method is applicable to such tissue remains elusive. Here we evaluated the applicability of the method in cavity-harboring tissues. First, we used synthetic data generated by simulations under cavities with pregiven cell-cell interaction potentials, to which our inference method was applied. The inferred effective potentials showed a profile modified from the pregiven potentials, but subsequent analyses revealed that the pregiven potentials can be reconstructed by substituting the effect of the expanding cavities which emerged as an additional repulsive component around long-distance of cell-cell interactions. Interestingly, simulations by using the modified effective potentials reproduced the cavity-harboring structures, implying that the effect of expanding cavities was approximately incorporated into the effective pairwise potentials. Then, we applied our inference method to the mouse blastocyst and cysts of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, and found that the inferred effective potentials can reproduce the cavity-harboring structures. A similar modification of pairwise potentials was also detected in two-dimensional cell sheets, by which curved sheets such as tubes and cups were simulated. We conclude that our inference method is applicable to tissues harboring cavities and cell sheets, and the resultant effective potentials are useful to simulate the morphologies.",

    "abstract": "Computational models that predict an individuals response to a vaccine offer the potential for mechanistic insights and personalized vaccination strategies. These models are increasingly derived from systems vaccinology studies that generate immune profiles from human cohorts pre- and post-vaccination. Most of these studies involve relatively small cohorts and profile the response to a single vaccine. The ability to assess the performance of the resulting models would be improved by comparing their performance on independent datasets, as has been done with great success in other areas of biology such as protein structure predictions. To transfer this approach to system vaccinology studies, we established a prototype platform that focuses on the evaluation of Computational Models of Immunity to Pertussis Booster vaccinations (CMI-PB). A community resource, CMI-PB generates experimental data for the explicit purpose of model evaluation, which is performed through a series of annual data releases and associated contests. We here report on our experience with the first such  dry run for a contest where the goal was to predict individual immune responses based on pre-vaccination multi-omic profiles. Over 30 models adopted from the literature were tested, but only one was predictive, and was based on age alone. The performance of new models built using CMI-PB training data was much better, but varied significantly based on the choice of pre-vaccination features used and the model building strategy. This suggests that previously published models developed for other vaccines do not generalize well to Pertussis Booster vaccination. Overall, these results reinforced the need for comparative analysis across models and datasets that CMI-PB aims to achieve. We are seeking wider community engagement for our first public prediction contest, which will open in early 2024.",

    "abstract": "Chlorpheniramine Maleate (CPM) has been identified as a potential antiviral compound against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this study, we investigated the in vitro effects of CPM on key stages of the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle, including viral adsorption, replication inhibition, and virucidal activity. Our findings demonstrate that CPM exhibits antiviral properties by interfering with viral adsorption, replication, and directly inactivating the virus. Molecular docking analysis revealed interactions between CPM and essential viral proteins, such as the main protease receptor, spike protein receptor, and RNA polymerase. CPMs interactions were primarily hydrophobic in nature, with an additional hydrogen bond formation in the RNA polymerase active site. These results suggest that CPM has the potential to serve as a multitarget antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2 and potentially other respiratory viruses. Further investigations are warranted to explore its clinical implications and assess its efficacy in vivo.",

    "abstract": "We explore opportunities, challenges, and strategies to translate and responsibly scale innovative biobased technologies to build more sustainable bioeconomies. The pandemic and other recent disruptions have increased exposure to issues of resilience and regional imbalance and raised attention to pathways that could shift production and consumption regimes based more on local biobased resources and dispersed production. The paper reviews potential biobased technologies strategies and then identifies promising and feasible options with a focus on the United Kingdom. Initial landscape and bibliometric analyses identified 50 potential existing and emerging potential biobased technologies. These technologies were assessed for their ability to fulfil requirements related to biobased production, national applicability, and economic, societal, and environmental benefits, leading to identification of 18 promising biobased production technologies. Through further analysis and focus group discussion with industrial, governmental, academic, agricultural, and social stakeholders, three technology clusters were identified for targeted assessment, drawing on cellulose-, lignin-, and seaweed-feedstocks. Case studies for each of these clusters were developed, addressing conversations around sustainable management and the use of biomass feedstocks, and associated environmental, social, and economic challenges. These cases are presented with discussion of insights and implications for policy. The approach presented in the paper is put forward as a scalable assessment method which can be useful in prompting, informing, and advancing discussion and deliberation on opportunities and challenges for biobased transformations.",

Both groups had strong IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, but the MIS-C patients had weaker antibody responses to certain epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins and to the S and N proteins of endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) compared to pediatric convalescent COVID patients. HCoV antibody reactivity was correlated with age. In contrast, MIS-C patients had elevated serum levels of several proinflammatory cytokines compared to convalescent COVID patients, including interleukins IL-6, IL-8, IL-18 and chemokines CCL2, CCL8, CXCL5, CXCL9 and CXCL10 as well as tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma.

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy is now an integral aspect of cancer therapy. Strategies employing adoptive cell therapy (ACT) have seen the establishment of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells using peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) with significant clinical results. Despite these successes, the limitations of the current strategies are also emerging and novel approaches are needed. The bone marrow (BM) is an immunological niche that houses T cells with specificity for previously encountered antigens, including tumor-associated antigens from certain solid cancers. This study sought to improve our understanding of tumor-specific BM T cells in the context of solid tumors by comparing them with TILs, and to assess whether there is a rationale for using the BM as a source of T cells for ACT against solid malignancies. Herein, we demonstrate that T cells from the BM appear superior to TILs as a source of cells for cellular therapy. Specifically, they possess a memory-enriched phenotype and exhibit improved effector function, greater persistence within a tumor-bearing host, and the capacity for increased tumor infiltration. Taken together, these data provide a foundation for further exploring the BM as a source of tumor-specific T cells for ACT in solid malignancies.\n\nKey MessagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSTIL therapy shows efficacy but significant limitations.

    "abstract": "DNA polymerases (DNAPs) synthesize DNA from deoxyribonucleotides in a semi-conservative manner and serve as the core of DNA replication and repair machineries. In eukaryotic cells, there are two genome-containing organelles, mitochondria and plastids, that were derived from an -proteobacterium and a cyanobacterium, respectively. Except for rare cases of genome-lacking mitochondria and plastids, both organelles must be served by nucleus-encoded DNAPs that localize and work in them to maintain their genomes. The evolution of organellar DNAPs has yet to be fully understood because of two unsettled issues. First, the diversity of organellar DNAPs has not been elucidated in the full spectrum of eukaryotes. Second, it is unclear when the DNAPs that were used originally in the endosymbiotic bacteria giving rise to mitochondria and plastids were discarded, as the organellar DNAPs known to date show no phylogenetic affinity to those of the extant -proteobacteria or cyanobacteria. In this study, we identified from diverse eukaryotes 134 family A DNAP sequences, which were classified into 10 novel types, and explored their evolutionary origins. The subcellular localizations of selected DNAPs were further examined experimentally. The results presented here suggest that the diversity of organellar DNAPs has been shaped by multiple transfers of the PolI gene from phylogenetically broad bacteria, and their occurrence in eukaryotes was additionally impacted by secondary plastid endosymbioses. Finally, we propose that the last eukaryotic common ancestor may have possessed two mitochondrial DNAPs, POP and a candidate of the direct descendant of the proto-mitochondrial DNAP, rdxPolA, identified in this study.",

    "abstract": "Insects use their mandibles for a variety of tasks, including cutting and material transport, defence, building nests, caring for brood, and competing for mates. Despite this functional diversity, mandible motion is thought to be constrained to rotation about a single fixed axis in the majority of extant species. Here, we conduct a direct quantitative test of this  hinge joint hypothesis in a species that uses its mandibles for a wide range of tasks: Atta vollenweideri leaf-cutter ants. Mandible movements from live restrained ants were reconstructed in 3D using a multi-camera rig. Rigid body kinematic analyses revealed strong evidence that mandible movement occupies a kinematic space which requires more than one rotational degree of freedom: at large opening angles, mandible motion is dominated by yaw. But at small opening angles, mandibles yaw and pitch. The combination of yaw and pitch allows mandibles to  criss-cross: either mandible can be on top when mandibles are closed. We observed criss-crossing in freely cutting ants, suggesting that it is functionally important. Combined with recent reports on diversity of joint articulations in other insects, our results show that insect mandible kinematics are more diverse than traditionally assumed, and thus worthy of further detailed investigation.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing provides an effective method for deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying mosquito development and mosquito-borne disease transmission, as well as for exploring genetic control strategies. However, delivering the Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complex by embryo injection to produce genetic modifications is challenging, is mostly confined to model mosquitoes and specialized laboratories, and has low editing efficiency. Here, we established an effective Receptor-Mediated Ovary Transduction of Cargo (ReMOT) control method, enabling the introduction of heritable mutations into Anopheles sinensis, the major malaria vector in China and Southeast Asia, via the injection of female adult mosquitoes. Injection of a mixture of P2C-DsRed and saponin resulted in red fluorescence in the ovaries, with a 100% success rate. Using this system, we knocked-out the pigment synthesis genes, Aswhite and Asyellow, using injected wild-type (WT) females mated with WT males, resulting in the highest efficiency of gene editing among mosquitoes under the same mating conditions. Furthermore, the gene-editing efficiency was increased by at least 2.1-fold using injected WT females mated with mutant males. This improved ReMOT control method exhibits high editing efficiency, with important benefits in terms of functional genomics research and genetic control strategies in An. sinensis. Moreover, this represents a convenient method for gene manipulation in laboratories that are unable to perform embryo injection or that lack embryo-injection equipment.",

    "abstract": "Collective behaviour occurs at all levels of the natural world, from cells joining together to form complex structures, to locusts interacting to form large and destructive plagues. These complex behaviours arise from simple individual and environmental interactions, and thus lend themselves well to mathematical modelling. One simplifying assumption, that of relative homogeneity of organisms, is often applied to keep the mathematics tractable. However, heterogeneity arising due to the internal state of individuals has an impact on these interactions and thus plays a role in group structure and dynamics.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce a continuum model that accounts for this heterogeneity in the form of a state space that models an organisms internal state and converts this to movement characteristics. Using a variety analytic techniques, we investigate the effect of internal state on aggregation density and aggregation formation behaviour, finding that density and formation is most affected by the ratio of attractive to dispersive interactions.\n\nWe then apply the model to a concrete example of locust foraging to investigate the effect of food, hunger, and gregarisation on locust group formation and structure. Through numerical simulations we find that the most gregarious and satiated locusts tend to be located towards the centre of locust groups. Conversely, hunger drives locusts towards the edges of the group. Finally, we find that locust group dispersal may be driven in part by hunger.\n\nAuthor SummaryCollective behaviour occurs at all levels of the natural world, from cells joining together to form complex structures, to locusts interacting to form large and destructive plagues. We can modelling these complex behaviours using mathematical models however we often need to rely on simplifying assumptions to keep the mathematics easy enough to analyse. One simplifying assumption that is often employed is assuming that all the modelled organisms are the same (or in one of only a few possible states). However, this is often not the case in nature where the differences between individuals arising due to internal characteristics, such as hunger or age, often affects their behaviour and thus can change group dynamics.\n\nIn this paper we introduce a mathematical model that is able to capture these differences and apply the newly developed model to locust foraging. We find that hunger tends to drive individuals to the edges of aggregations as well as lowers the maximum possible density. These two results combine to give a possible mechanism for the dispersal of locust groups.",

The compounds inhibiting Mac1 were discovered through high-throughput screening (HTS) using a protein FRET-based competition assay and the best hit compound had an IC50 of 14 {micro}M. Three validated HTS hits have the same 2-amide-3-methylester thiophene scaffold and the scaffold was selected for structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies through commercial and synthesized analogs. We studied the compound binding mode in detail using X-ray crystallography and this allowed us to focus on specific features of the compound and design analogs. Compound 27 (MDOLL-0229) had an IC50 of 2.1 {micro}M and was generally selective for CoV Mac1 proteins after profiling for activity against a panel of viral and human ADP-ribose binding proteins. The improved potency allowed testing of its effect on virus replication and indeed, 27 inhibited replication of a mouse hepatitis virus, a prototype CoV. Compound 27 is the first Mac1 targeted small molecule demonstrated to inhibit coronavirus replication in a cell model.

    "abstract": "Summary/AbstractNon-viral DNA donor template has been widely used for targeted genomic integration by homologous recombination (HR). This process has become more efficient with RNA guided endonuclease editor system such as CRISPR/Cas9. Circular single stranded DNA (cssDNA) has been harnessed previously as a genome engineering catalyst (GATALYST) for efficient and safe targeted gene knock-in. However, the engineering efficiency is bottlenecked by the nucleoplasm trafficking and genomic tethering of cssDNA donor, especially for extra-large transgene integration. Here we developed enGager, enhanced GATALYST associated genome editor system by fusion of nucleus localization signal (NLS) peptide tagged Cas9 with various single stranded DNA binding protein modules through a GFP reporter Knock-in screening. The enGager system assembles an integrative genome integration machinery by forming tripartite complex for engineered nuclease editors, sgRNA and ssDNA donors, thereby facilitate the nucleus trafficking of DNA donors and increase their active local concentration at the targeted genomic site. When applied for genome integration with cssDNA donor templates to diverse genomic loci in various cell types, these enGagers outperform unfused editors. The enhancement of integration efficiency ranges from 1.5- to more than 6-fold, with the effect being more prominent for > 4Kb transgene knock-in in primary cells. We further demonstrated that enGager mediated enhancement for genome integration is ssDNA, but less dsDNA dependent. Using one of the mini-enGagers, we demonstrated large chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) transgene integration in primary T cells with exceptional efficiency and anti-tumor function. These tripartite editors with ssDNA optimized genome engineering system (TESOGENASETM) add a set of novel endonuclease editors into the gene-editing toolbox for potential cell and gene therapeutic development based on ssDNA mediated non-viral genome engineering.\n\nHighlightO_LIA reporter Knock-in screening establishes enGager system to identify TESOGENASE editor to improving ssDNA mediated genome integration\nC_LIO_LIMini-TESOGENASEs developed by fusing Cas9 nuclease with novel ssDNA binding motifs\nC_LIO_LImRNA mini-TESOGENASEs enhance targeted genome integration via various non-viral delivery approaches\nC_LIO_LIEfficient functional CAR-T cell engineering by mini-TESOGENASE\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is characterised by the prevalence of oncogenic mutations in KRAS. Previous studies have reported that altered Kras gene dosage drives progression and metastatic incidence in pancreatic cancer. While the role of oncogenic KRAS mutation is well characterised, the relevance of the partnering wild-type KRAS allele in pancreatic cancer is less well understood and controversial. Using in vivo mouse modelling of pancreatic cancer, we demonstrate that wild-type Kras restrains the oncogenic impact of mutant Kras, and drastically impacts both Kras-mediated tumourigenesis and therapeutic response. Mechanistically, deletion of wild-type Kras increases oncogenic Kras signalling through the downstream MAPK effector pathway, driving pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) initiation. In addition, in the KPC mouse model, a more aggressive model of pancreatic cancer, loss of wild-type KRAS leads to accelerated initiation but delayed tumour progression. These tumours had altered stroma, downregulated Myc levels and an enrichment for immunogenic gene signatures. Importantly, loss of wild-type Kras sensitises Kras mutant tumours to MEK1/2 inhibition though tumours eventually become resistant and then rapidly progress. This study demonstrates the repressive role of wild-type Kras during pancreatic tumourigenesis and highlights the critical impact of the presence of wild-type KRAS on tumourigenesis and therapeutic response in pancreatic cancer.",

    "abstract": "Bifidobacteria commonly represent a dominant constituent of human gut microbiomes during infancy, influencing nutrition, immune development, and resistance to infection. Despite interest as a probiotic therapy, predicting the nutritional requirements and health-promoting effects of Bifidobacteria is challenging due to major knowledge gaps. To overcome these deficiencies, we used large-scale genetics to create a compendium of mutant fitness in Bifidobacterium breve (Bb). We generated a high density, randomly barcoded transposon insertion pool in Bb, and used this pool to determine Bb fitness requirements during colonization of germ-free mice and chickens with multiple diets and in response to hundreds of in vitro perturbations. To enable mechanistic investigation, we constructed an ordered collection of insertion strains covering 1462 genes. We leveraged these tools to improve models of metabolic pathways, reveal unexpected host- and diet-specific requirements for colonization, and connect the production of immunomodulatory molecules to growth benefits. These resources will greatly reduce the barrier to future investigations of this important beneficial microbe.",

    "abstract": "Viruses are a core component of the human microbiome, impacting health and disease through interactions with gut bacteria1 and the immune system2. Most viruses in the human microbiome are bacteriophages, which exclusively infect bacteria. Individual gut bacteriophages can affect bacterial bile acid deconjugation3, and can alter their infection strategy based on dietary content4. Up to recently, most studies of the gut virome have focused on low taxonomic scales (e.g., viral operational taxonomic units), hampering population-level analyses. We previously identified the expansive and widespread Candidatus Heliusviridae bacteriophage family in a cohort with inhabitants of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Here, we study their biodiversity and evolution in a wide variety of human populations. With a more detailed phylogeny based on sequences from six viral genome databases, we now propose the Candidatus order Heliusvirales to accommodate these viruses. We identify Ca. Heliusvirales viruses in 80% of 5,441 individuals across 39 studies, and also in thirteen out of sixteen analyzed metagenomes from ancient humans that lived in Europe and North America between 1,000 and 5,000 years ago. We show that a large Ca. Heliusvirales lineage has diversified starting with human dispersion across the globe some 50,000 years ago. Ancient peoples and modern hunter-gatherers further have distinct Ca. Heliusvirales populations that are characterized by lower richness than modern urbanized people. Within urbanized people, those suffering from type 1 and type 2 diabetes, as well as inflammatory bowel disease, have higher Ca. Heliusvirales richness than healthy controls. We thus conclude that these ancient core members of the human gut virome have thrived with increasingly westernized lifestyles of the human population.",

    "abstract": "Microorganisms frequently migrate from one ecosystem to another, influencing and shaping their new environment. Yet, despite the potential importance of this process in modulating the environment and the microbial ecosystem, our understanding of the fundamental forces that govern microbial migration and dispersion is still lacking. Moreover, while theoretical studies and in-vitro experimental work have highlighted the contribution of biotic interactions to the assembly of the community, identifying such interactions in vivo, specifically in communities as complex as the human gut, remains challenging. To this end, we developed a new, robust, and compositionally invariant approach, and leveraged data from well-characterized translocation experiments, namely, clinical fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) trials, to rigorously pinpoint dependencies between taxa during the colonization of human gastrointestinal habitat. Our analysis identified numerous pairwise dependencies between co-colonizing microbes during migration between gastrointestinal environments. We further demonstrated that identified dependencies agree with previously reported findings from in-vitro experiments and population-wide distribution patterns. Finally, we characterized the web of metabolic dependencies between these taxa and explored the functional properties that may promote better dispersion. Combined, our findings provide insights into the principles and determinants of community dynamics following ecological translocation, informing potential opportunities for precise community design.",

    "abstract": "Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are small selfish genetic modules that increase vertical stability of their replicons. They have long been thought to stabilize plasmids by killing cells that fail to inherit a plasmid copy through a phenomenon called post-segregational killing (PSK) or addiction. While this model has been widely accepted, no direct observation of PSK was reported in the literature. Here, we devised a system that enables visualization of plasmid loss and PSK at the single-cell level using meganuclease-driven plasmid curing. Using the ccd system, we show that cells deprived of a ccd-encoding plasmid show hallmarks of DNA damage, i.e. filamentation and induction of the SOS response. Activation of ccd-triggered cell death in most plasmid-free segregants, although some intoxicated cells were able to resume growth, showing that PSK-induced damage can be repaired in a SOS-dependent manner. Damage induced by ccd activates resident lambdoid prophages, which potentiate the killing effect of ccd. The loss of a model plasmid containing TA systems encoding toxins presenting various molecular mechanisms induced different morphological changes, growth arrest and loss of viability. Our experimental setup enables further studies of TA-induced phenotypes and suggests that PSK is a general mechanism for plasmid stabilization by TA systems.",

    "abstract": "Plant pathogens can quickly evolve in response to the changing host and environment, resulting in destructive epidemics. The fungus Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), causing wheat stripe rust disease worldwide, is one such pathogen. In the arms race between pathogens and hosts, changes in host populations exerted continuous selective forces on the dynamics of pathogens. However, the footprints of these selection forces and the demography of Pst remain poorly explored, limited our understanding the evolutionary processes that shape the spread and evolution of pathogens. In this study, we revealed several features of worldwide Pst populations through population genomic analyses. There might be limited gene flow between Pst populations from China and other countries. A slower rate of linkage disequilibrium decay was detected comparing to rust fungi with known sexual reproduction. Furthermore, we detected extensive hard and soft sweeps associated with Pst adaptation. Genes within the selective sweeps were enriched in secreted proteins and effectors and showed functions related to pathogenicity or virulence, temperature tolerance, and fungicide resistance implying that Chinese Pst populations suffered positive selection pressures from host and abiotic factors. Moreover, demographic history indicated Pst populations experienced strong bottlenecks at the beginning of the wheat domestication around 10,000 years ago and during modern agriculture around 100 years ago, suggesting that the crop domestication and breeding programs could continuously contribute to the decline of pathogen effective population sizes. Our results provided insights into the evolution of the Pst genome and highlighted the role of modern agriculture on pathogen demography.\n\nAuthor SummaryWheat stripe rust, as a pathogen of wheat, is capable of inducing significant yield reduction on a global scale. Traditional epidemiological investigations have elucidated the causative agent behind this disease, the wheat stripe rust pathogen, as an organism exhibiting swift adaptive evolution in response to its environment.\n\nHowever, the precise mechanisms underpinning its adaptive strategies and the ensuing alterations in population dynamics remain relatively unexplored.\n\nIn our research, we have undertaken an analysis encompassing wheat stripe rust samples throughout the world. Employing population genomics methods, we have sought to discern the genomic footprints corresponding to the adaptive process within the pathogen. These genomic footprints have illuminated the operation of positive selection pressures caused by both the host plant and the ecological context.\n\nConcurrently, it have provided insights into the population size that the wheat stripe rust pathogen has undergone over millennia. Notably, its change in population size revealed the demographic history associated with wheat domestication.",

    "abstract": "While rodents are primary reservoirs of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), their role in Madariaga virus (MADV) transmission remains uncertain, particularly given their overlapping geographic distribution. This study explores the interplay of alphavirus prevalence, rodent diversity, and land use within Darien and Western Panama provinces. A total of three locations were selected for rodent sampling in Darien province: Los Pavitos, El Real de Santa Maria and Santa Librada. Two sites were selected in Western Panama province: El Cacao and Ciri Grande. We used plaque reduction neutralization tests to assess MADV and VEEV seroprevalences in 599 rodents of 16 species across five study sites. MADV seroprevalence was observed at higher rates in Los Pavitos (Darien province), 9.0%, 95% CI: 3.6-17.6, while VEEV seroprevalence was elevated in El Cacao (Western Panama province), 27.3%, 95% CI: 16.1-40.9, and El Real de Santa Maria (Darien province), 20.4%, 95% CI: 12.6-29.7. Species like Oryzomys coesi, 23.1%, 95% CI: 5.0-53.8, and Transandinomys bolivaris, 20.0%, 95% CI: 0.5-71.6 displayed higher MADV seroprevalences than other species, whereas Transandinomys bolivaris, 80.0%, 95% CI: 28.3-99.4, and Proechimys semispinosus, 27.3%, 95% CI: 17.0-39.6, exhibited higher VEEV seroprevalences. Our findings provide support to the notion that rodents are vertebrate reservoirs of MADV and reveal spatial variations in alphavirus seropositivity among rodent species, with different provinces exhibiting distinct rates for MADV and VEEV. Moreover, specific rodent species are linked to unique seroprevalence patterns for these viruses, suggesting that rodent diversity and environmental conditions might play a significant role in shaping alphavirus distribution.",

Using a new fate mapping approach in transgenic chickens, we show that there is a small contribution of SHH expressing cells to the posterior ulna, posterior carpals and digit 3. We establish that while the majority of the ulna develops in response to paracrine SHH signaling in both the chicken and mouse, there are differences in the contribution of SHH expressing cells to other tissues of the zeugopod between these two species as well as between the chicken ulna and fibula. This is evidence that although zeugopod bones are clearly homologous according to the fossil record, the zeugopod bones of the wing and leg are formed by subtly different signalling and patterning events during embryonic development, which can be used to understand the shaping of the bird wing skeleton during the evolution of powered flight.",

    "abstract": "Fluxes in human intra- and extracellular copper levels recently garnered attention for roles in cellular signaling, including affecting levels of the signaling molecule cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). We herein applied an unbiased temporal evaluation of the whole-genome transcriptional activities modulated by fluctuations in copper levels to identify the copper sensor proteins responsible for driving these activities. We found that fluctuations in physiologically-relevant copper levels rapidly modulate EGFR/MAPK/ERK signal transduction and activation of the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Both intracellular and extracellular assays support Cu1+ inhibition of the EGFR-phosphatase PTPN2 (and potentially the homologous PTPN1)-via direct ligation to the PTPN2 active site cysteine side chain-as the underlying mechanism of copper-stimulated EGFR signal transduction activation. Depletion of copper represses this signaling pathway. We additionally show i) copper supplementation drives transcriptional repression of the copper importer CTR1 and ii) CREB activity is inversely correlated with CTR1 expression. In summary, our study reveals PTPN2 as a physiological copper sensor and defines a regulatory mechanism linking feedback control of copper-stimulated MAPK/ERK/CREB-signaling and CTR1 expression, thereby uncovering a previously unrecognized link between copper levels and cellular signal transduction.",

    "abstract": "An evolutionarily conserved region of the TDP-43 low complexity domain twenty residues in length can adopt either an -helical or {beta}-strand conformation. When in the latter conformation, TDP-43 self-associates via the formation of a labile, cross-{beta} structure. Self-association can be monitored via the formation of phase separated protein droplets. Exposure of droplets to hydrogen peroxide leads to oxidation of conserved methionine residues distributed throughout the low complexity domain. Oxidation disassembles the cross-{beta} structure, thus eliminating both self-association and phase separation. Here we demonstrate that this process reciprocally enables formation of -helical structure in precisely the same region formerly functioning to facilitate {beta}-strand mediated self-association. We further observe that the -helical conformation allows interaction with a lipid-like detergent, and that exposure to lipids enhances the {beta}-to- conformational switch. We hypothesize that regulation of this oxidative switch will prove to be important to the control of localized translation within vertebrate cells. The experimental observations reported herein were heavily reliant on studies of 1,6-hexanediol, a chemical agent that selectively dissolves labile structures formed via the self-association of protein domains of low sequence complexity. This aliphatic alcohol is shown to exert its dissociative activity primarily via hydrogen bonding interactions with carbonyl oxygen atoms of the polypeptide backbone. Such observations underscore the central importance of backbone-mediated protein:protein interactions that facilitate the self-association and phase separation of low complexity domains.\n\nSignificance StatementThe TDP-43 protein is a constituent of RNA granules involved in regulated translation. TDP-43 contains a C-terminal domain of 150 amino acids of low sequence complexity conspicuously decorated with ten methionine residues. An evolutionarily conserved region (ECR) of 20 residues within this domain can adopt either of two forms of labile secondary structure. Under normal conditions wherein methionine residues are reduced, the ECR forms a labile cross-{beta} structure that enables RNA granule condensation. Upon methionine oxidation, the ECR undergoes a conformational switch to become an -helix incompatible with self-association and granule integrity. Oxidation of the TDP-43 low complexity domain is hypothesized to occur proximal to mitochondria, thus facilitating dissolution of RNA granules and activation of localized translation.",

Automated nanoparticle (NP) protein corona-based proteomics workflows can efficiently compress the dynamic range of protein abundances into a mass spectrometry (MS)-accessible detection range. This enhances the depth and scalability of quantitative MS-based methods, which can elucidate the molecular mechanisms of biological processes, discover new protein biomarkers, and improve comprehensiveness of MS-based diagnostics.\n\nMethodsInvestigating multi-species spike-in experiments and a cohort, we investigated fold-change accuracy, linearity, precision, and statistical power for the using the Proteograph Product Suite, a deep plasma proteomics workflow, in conjunction with multiple MS instruments.\n\nResultsWe show that NP-based workflows enable accurate identification (false discovery rate of 1%) of more than 6,000 proteins from plasma (Orbitrap Astral) and, compared to a gold standard neat plasma workflow that is limited to the detection of hundreds of plasma proteins, facilitate quantification of more proteins with accurate fold-changes, high linearity, and precision. Furthermore, we demonstrate high statistical power for the discovery of biomarkers in small- and large-scale cohorts.\n\nConclusionsThe automated NP workflow enables high-throughput, deep, and quantitative plasma proteomics investigation with sufficient power to discover new biomarker signatures with a peptide level resolution.",

    "abstract": "Several egress pathways have been defined for many viruses. Among these pathways, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been shown to function as vehicles of non-lytic viral egress. EVs are heterogenous populations of membrane-bound structures released from cells as a form of intercellular communication. EV-mediated viral egress may enable immune evasion and collective viral transport. Strains of nonenveloped mammalian orthoreovirus (reovirus) differ in cell lysis phenotypes, with T3D disrupting cell membranes more efficiently than T1L. However, mechanisms of reovirus egress and the influence of transport strategy on infection are only partially understood. To elucidate reovirus egress mechanisms, we infected murine fibroblasts (L cells) and non-polarized human colon epithelial (Caco-2) cells with T1L or T3D reovirus and enriched cell culture supernatants for large EVs, medium EVs, small EVs, and free reovirus. We found that both reovirus strains exit cells in association with large and medium EVs and as free virus particles, and that EV-enriched fractions are infectious. While reovirus visually associates with large and medium EVs, only medium EVs offer protection from antibody-mediated neutralization. EV-mediated protection from neutralization is virus strain- and cell type-specific, as medium EVs enriched from L cell supernatants protect T1L and T3D, while medium EVs enriched from Caco-2 cell supernatants largely fail to protect T3D and only protect T1L efficiently. Using genetically barcoded reovirus, we provide evidence that large and medium EVs can convey multiple particles to recipient cells. Finally, T1L or T3D infection increases the release of all EV sizes from L cells. Together, these findings suggest that in addition to exiting cells as free particles, reovirus promotes egress from distinct cell types in association with large and medium EVs during lytic or non-lytic infection, a mode of exit that can mediate multiparticle infection and, in some cases, protection from antibody neutralization.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe exit strategy that many viruses use to escape cells is unknown. Reovirus is a nonenveloped human virus and an ideal model system to understand virus exit strategies and their inluence on infection. We found that two different reovirus strains, one that disrupts cell membranes and one that leaves cells largely intact, increase the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from cells. Both reovirus strains are released from cells as free particles and in association with EVs, which are membrane-bound structures that function in cell-to-cell communication. Depending on cell type and virus type, EVs can act like an  invisibility cloak that shields reovirus from antibodies. EVs can also bundle and ferry reovirus particles between cells. Although we used cells to examine the effects of reovirus association with EVs, it is possible that in mammalian hosts, EVs may shield reovirus from immune defenses and promote more efficient transmission and infection through a  strength-in-numbers strategy. Future work building on these findings will test the biological significance of EV-enclosed reovirus and may inform delivery strategies for oncolytic reoviruses to tumor sites. Broadly, these findings enhance our understanding of virus egress strategies and infection principles that may apply to other viruses that travel in EVs.",

    "abstract": "In pathologies such as cancer, aberrant Transforming Growth Factor-{beta} (TGF-{beta}) signaling exerts profound tumor intrinsic and extrinsic consequences. Intense clinical endeavors are underway to target this pivotal pathway. Central to the success of these interventions is pinpointing factors that decisively modulate the TGF-{beta} responses. Betaglycan/type III TGF-{beta} receptor (T{beta}RIII), is an established co-receptor for the TGF-{beta} superfamily known to bind directly to TGF-{beta}s 1-3 and inhibin A/B. While betaglycan can be membrane-bound, it can also undergo ectodomain cleavage to produce soluble-betaglycan that can sequester its ligands. The extracellular domain of betaglycan undergoes heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan modifications, transforming betaglycan into a proteoglycan. Here we report the unexpected discovery that the heparan sulfate modifications are critical for the ectodomain shedding of betaglycan. In the absence of such modifications, betaglycan is not shed. Such shedding is indispensable for the ability of betaglycan to suppress TGF-{beta} signaling and the cells responses to exogenous TGF-{beta} ligands. Using unbiased transcriptomics, we identified TIMP3 as a key regulator of betaglycan shedding and thereby TGF-{beta} signaling. Our results bear significant clinical relevance as modified betaglycan is present in the ascites of patients with ovarian cancer and can serve as a marker for predicting patient outcomes and TGF-{beta} signaling responses. These studies are the first to demonstrate a unique reliance on the glycosaminoglycan modifications of betaglycan for shedding and influence on TGF-{beta} signaling responses. Dysregulated shedding of TGF-{beta} receptors plays a vital role in determining the response and availability of TGF-{beta}s, which is crucial for prognostic predictions and understanding of TGF-{beta} signaling dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Metabolites from feces provide important insights into the functionality of the gut microbiome. As immediate freezing is not always feasible in gut microbiome studies, there is a need for sampling protocols that provide stability of the fecal metabolome and microbiome at room temperature (RT). For this purpose, we investigated the stability of various metabolites and the microbiome (16S ribosomal RNA) in feces collected in 95% ethanol (EtOH) or OMNImet(R)*GUT/ OMNIgene(R)*GUT. To simulate in field-collection scenarios, the samples were stored at different temperatures at varying durations (24h +4{degrees}C, 24h RT, 36h RT, 48h RT, and 7 days RT), and compared to aliquots immediately frozen at -80{degrees}C. We applied several targeted and untargeted metabolomics platforms to measure lipids, polar untargeted metabolites, endocannabinoids, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and bile acids (BAs). We found that SCFAs in the non-stabilized samples increased over time, while a stable profile was recorded in sample aliquots stored in 95% EtOH and OMNImet(R)*GUT. When comparing the metabolite levels between fecal aliquots stored at room temperature and at +4{degrees}C, we detected several changes in microbial metabolites, including multiple BAs and SCFAs. Taken together, we found that storing fecal samples at room temperature and stabilizing them in 95% EtOH yielded metabolomic results comparable to flash freezing. We also found that overall composition of the gut microbiome did not vary significantly between different storage types. However, there were notable differences observed in alpha diversity. Taken together, the stability of the metabolome and microbiome in 95 % EtOH provided similar results as the validated commercial collection kits OMNImet(R)*GUT and OMNIgene(R)*GUT, respectively.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe analysis of the gut metabolome and microbiome requires the separate collection of fecal specimens using conventional methods or commercial kits. However, these approaches can potentially introduce sampling errors and biases. In addition, the logistical requirements of studying large human cohorts have driven the need for home collection and transport of human fecal specimens at room temperature. By adopting a unified sampling approach at room temperature, we can enhance sampling convenience and practicality, leading to a more precise and comprehensive understanding of gut microbial function. However, the development and applications of such unified sampling systems still face limitations. The results presented in this study aim to address this knowledge gap by investigating the stability of metabolites and the microbiome (16S ribosomal RNA) from fecal samples collected using 95% EtOH, in comparison to well-established commercial collection kits for fecal metabolome (OMNImet(R)*GUT) and microbiome (OMNIgene(R) *GUT) profiling. Additionally, we perform a comparative analysis of various platforms and metabolomic coverage using matrices containing ethanol, evaluating aspects of sensitivity, robustness, and throughput.",

    "abstract": "Single cell proteomics (SCP) requires the analysis of dozens to thousands of single human cells to draw biological conclusions. However, assessing of the abundance of single proteins in output data presents a considerable challenge, and no simple universal solutions currently exist. To address this, we developed SCP Viz, a statistical package with a graphical user interface that can handle small and large scale SCP output from any instrument or data processing software. In this software, the abundance of individual proteins can be plotted in a variety of ways, using either unadjusted or normalized outputs. These outputs can also be transformed or imputed within the software. SCP Viz offers a variety of plotting options which can help identify significantly altered proteins between groups, both before and after quantitative transformations. Upon the discovery of subpopulations of single cells, users can easily regroup the cells of interest using straightforward text-based filters. When used in this way, SCP Viz allows users to visualize proteomic heterogeneity at the level of individual proteins, cells, or identified subcellular populations. SCP Viz is compatible with output files from MaxQuant, FragPipe, SpectroNaut, and Proteome Discoverer, and should work equally well with other formats. SCP Viz is publicly available at https://github.com/orsburn/SCPViz. For demonstrations, users can download our test data from GitHub and use an online version that accepts user input for analysis at https://orsburnlab.shinyapps.io/SCPViz/.\n\nAbstract graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=167 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/555397v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@73456aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d24f1aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@47402dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c683f1_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "PP2A serine/threonine protein phosphatases are heterotrimeric complexes that have a wide range of essential physiologic functions. The B55 form of PP2A has critical roles in cell cycle regulation, mitotic exit, and the DNA damage response1-6. Its activity is modulated by additional regulatory proteins, such as ARPP197, FAM122A8, and IER59. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the modulation of PP2A activity by these proteins remain elusive. Here, we show that IER5 inhibits pTau dephosphorylation by PP2A/B55 in biochemical assays and report a cryoelectron microscopy structure of the PP2A/B55-IER5 complex, which reveals that IER5 occludes a surface on B55 used for substrate recruitment10-12. Mutation of interface residues on IER5 interferes with recovery of B55 in co-immunoprecipitation assays and suppresses events in squamous carcinoma cells, such as KRT1 expression, that depend on inhibition of PP2A/B55 by IER59. These studies define the molecular basis for PP2A inhibition by IER5 and suggest a roadmap for selective pharmacologic modulation of PP2A/B55 complexes.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial biofilms consist of cells encased in an extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) composed of exopolysaccharides, extracellular DNA, and proteins that are critical for cell-cell adhesion and protect the cells from environmental stress, antibiotic treatments, and the host immune response. Degrading EPS components or blocking their production have emerged as promising strategies for prevention or dispersal of bacterial biofilms, but we still have little information about the specific biomolecular interactions that occur between cells and EPS components and how those interactions contribute to biofilm production. Staphylococcus epidermidis is a leading cause of nosocomial infections as a result of producing biofilms that use the exopolysaccharide poly- (1[-&gt;]6)-{beta}-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG) as a major structural component. In this study, we have developed a live cell proximity labeling approach combined with quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics to map the PNAG interactome of live S. epidermidis biofilms. Through these measurements we discovered elastin-binding protein (EbpS) as a major PNAG-interacting protein. Using live cell binding measurements, we found that the lysin motif (LysM) domain of EbpS specifically binds to PNAG present in S. epidermidis biofilms. Our work provides a novel method for the rapid identification of exopolysaccharide-binding proteins in live biofilms that will help to extend our understanding of the biomolecular interactions that are required for bacterial biofilm formation.",

    "abstract": "Vibrio vulnificus occurs naturally in seawater and causes debilitating, often fatal illnesses, particularly in people with underlying health issues such as liver disease. The illness can occur when raw molluscan shellfish that have bio-accumulated the organism are consumed. New Zealand seafood is not known to have caused any illnesses, although there have been wound infections. This study sought to better understand the effect of environmental conditions on concentrations of V. vulnificus in Pacific oysters in three harbours over the summer months of 2016-19. Fortnightly sampling at two harbours only once gave a most probable number (MPN) of >10 per g of oyster meat, while the third harbour regularly produced much higher counts (up to 220,000 per g). From 2017-19, weekly samples from three sites in this harbour (four in 2018) were tested. Eleven peaks in concentration were observed, all when seawater temperatures exceeded 20{degrees}C and after heavy rainfall had reduced the seawater salinity, usually to <25{per thousand} from the average of 32{per thousand}. A fitted structural equation model with temperature and salinity terms accounted for 60% of the variance in concentrations and rates of decline after concentration peaks averaged 1.05 log10 MPN per week.\n\nThe rate of decline was highly variable so microbiological testing would be required to confirm this rate for use in food safety management. However, the results of the study will enable better risk management.\n\nImportanceVibrio vulnificus is a deadly bacterium that naturally occurs in some seawater and can be concentrated in shellfish such as oysters. Consumers with underlying health issues who eat contaminated shellfish may suffer serious illnesses. New Zealand shellfish have never been known to cause such illnesses although the species is present in our seawater. The strains present may not be able to cause foodborne illness. We found that V. vulnificus could be present in high concentrations in farmed Pacific oysters in one of three studied harbours. This happened when seawater temperatures were warm and heavy rainfall reduced salinity. We developed a model based on seawater temperature and salinity that would be able to predict concentrations in shellfish, at least in this harbour. This will help industry and regulators manage the food safety risk should this organism become a public health issue.\n\nTweetWe modelled concentrations of Vibrio vulnificus in Pacific oysters after flood events and showed that seawater salinity and temperatures in previous 168 h affected them.",

    "abstract": "The SLC9C1 gene (which encodes the NHE10 protein) is essential for male fertility in both mice and humans, however the epigenetic mechanisms regulating its testis/sperm-specific gene expression have yet to be studied. Here we identify and characterize DNA regulatory elements of the SLC9C1 gene across three mammalian species: mouse, rat, and human. First, in silico analysis of these mammalian SLC9C1 genes identified a CpG island located upstream of the transcription start site in the same relative position in all three genes. Further analysis reveals that this CpG island behaves differently, with respect to gene regulatory activity, in the mouse SLC9C1 gene than it does in the rat and human SLC9C1 gene. The mouse SLC9C1 CpG island displays strong promoter activity by itself and seems to have a stronger gene regulatory effect than either the rat or human SLC9C1 CpG islands. While the function of the upstream SLC9C1 CpG island may be divergent across the three studied species, it appears that the promoters of these three mammalian SLC9C1 genes share similar DNA methylation-sensitive regulatory mechanisms. All three SLC9C1 promoter regions are differentially methylated in lung and testis, being more hypermethylated in lung relative to the testis, and DNA sequence alignments provide strong evidence of primary sequence conservation. Luciferase assays reveal that in vitro methylation of constructs containing different elements of the three SLC9C1 genes largely exhibit methylation-sensitive promoter activity (reduced promoter activity when methylated) in both HEK 293 and GC-1spg cells. In total, our data suggest that the DNA methylation-sensitive elements of the mouse, rat, and human SLC9C1 promoters are largely conserved, while the upstream SLC9C1 CpG island common to all three species seems to perform a different function in mouse than it does in rat and human. This work provides evidence that while homologous genes can all be regulated by DNA methylation-dependent epigenetic mechanisms, the location of the specific cis-regulatory elements responsible for this regulation can differ across species.",

We show that at the level of the Golgi apparatus, the PDZ-binding motif of the E protein is not detected by E C-terminal specific antibodies neither by PDZ domain-containing protein binding partner. Four alanine substitutions upstream of the PBM in the central region of the E protein tail is sufficient to generate immunodetection by anti-E antibodies and trigger robust recruitment of the PDZ domain-containing protein into the Golgi organelle. Overall, this work suggests that the presentation of the PBM to the cytoplasm is under conformational regulation mediated by the central region of the E protein tail and that PBM presentation probably does not occur at the surface of Golgi cisternae but likely at post-Golgi stages of the viral cycle.",
