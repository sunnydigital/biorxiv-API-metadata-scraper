    "abstract": "Alterations to the balance between excitation and inhibition (E/I ratio) are postulated to underlie behavioral phenotypes in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients and mouse models. However, in wild type mice the E/I ratio is not constant, but instead oscillates across the 24h day. Therefore, we tested whether the E/I oscillation, rather than the overall E/I ratio, is disrupted in two ASD-related mouse lines: Fmr1 KO and BTBR, models of syndromic and idiopathic ASD, respectively. The E/I ratio is dysregulated in both models, but in different ways: the oscillation is lost in Fmr1 KO and reversed in BTBR mice. In both models these phenotypes associate with differences the timing of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission and endocannabinoid signaling compared to wild type mice, but not with altered sleep. These findings raise the possibility that ASD-related phenotypes may be produced by a mismatch of E/I to the appropriate behavioral state, rather than alterations to overall E/I levels per se.",

    "abstract": "The speed-curvature power law is one of the most studied constraints in biological movement. In many types of movements, there is a strong relationship between instantaneous speed and local curvature. For example, in elliptical trajectories, tangential speed is proportional to curvature raised to the power -1/3, (V[~]C-1/3). This phenomenon is known as the \"one-thirds power law\" and is generally considered to be mathematically equivalent to the \"two-thirds power law\" that describes the relationship between angular speed and curvature (A[~]C2/3); the two formulations are used interchangeably. However, in this paper, analysis of empirical and synthetic data demonstrates that using angular speed instead of tangential speed to estimate the power law tends to result in much stronger correlations, impacting the interpretation of the strength of the relationship, and therefore the existence of the law. Further analysis shows that angular speed and curvature are often trivially correlated, since angular speed is not a purely kinematic variable and depends on curvature. In conclusion, two forms of the law are not equivalent, angular speed should be avoided when expressing the speed-curvature power law.",

    "abstract": "The transcription of stress-inducible genes requires synchronized and robust activation, which is critical for organismal survival and homeostasis. The function of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway is required for the activation of immediate early genes (IEGs), including EGR1 and FOS, for cell growth and proliferation1-3. In addition, recent studies have identified topoisomerase II (TOP2) as one of the important regulators of the transcriptional activation of IEGs4-6. However, the mechanism underlying transcriptional regulation involving TOP2 in IEG activation has remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate that ERK2, but not ERK1, is important for IEG transcriptional activation and report a critical ELK1 binding sequence for ERK2 function at the EGR1 gene. Our data indicate that both ERK1 and ERK2 extensively phosphorylate the C-terminal domain of TOP2B at mutual and distinctive residues. Although both ERK1 and ERK2 enhance the catalytic rate of TOP2B required to relax positive DNA supercoiling, ERK1 can relax the DNA by itself and produces a semi-relaxed DNA, which is apparently resistant to TOP2B catalysis. Inhibition of ERK2 kinase activity or ERK2 knock-down interferes with transcription and deregulates TOP2B in IEGs. Furthermore, we obtained the first cryo-EM structure of the human cell-purified TOP2B and etoposide together with the EGR1 transcriptional start site (50 nt; -30 to +20) that has the strongest affinity to TOP2B within -423 to +332. The structure elucidated in our studies showed TOP2B-mediated breakage and dramatic bending of the double-stranded DNA, comparable to previously reported structures of TOP2. Our cell-based analyses showed transcriptional activation by etoposide and transcriptional inhibition by ICRF193 at EGR1 and FOS, suggesting that TOP2B-mediated DNA break to favor transcriptional activation. Taken together, this study suggests that activated ERK2 phosphorylates TOP2B to regulate TOP2-DNA interactions and favor transcriptional activation in IEGs. We propose that TOP2B association, catalysis, and dissociation on its substrate DNA are important processes for regulating transcription and that ERK2-mediated TOP2B phosphorylation may be key for the catalysis and dissociation steps.",

    "abstract": "Amino acid substitutions in proteins resulting from gene mutations are essential to the evolutionary process that enhances the organisms adaption and survival rate. The primary aim of such substitution is to improve the proteins function and structural stability. Various computational and experimental techniques are available to understand the effect of amino acid substitution on a proteins function and structural stability and ultimately the effect on drug binding. This work seeks to understand how amino acid substitutions help overcome the anti-infective effect of drugs by diminishing their inhibitory potential. We attempt to locate hotspots among the amino acids in the binding site, where substitutions are likely to cause drug resistance. To achieve this, we propose an empirical score using atomic fluctuations coupled with amino acid variability to identify amino acids that are likely to mutate, leading to drug resistance. The scoring method has been developed and validated on two extensively studied drugs inhibiting HIV-1 protease, namely nelfinavir and darunavir. Further, we choose anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and its inhibitor, crizotinib, to test the performance of this empirical score. The prediction works well for amino acids within a radius of 5 [A] from the centre of mass of the drug. The advantage of this method is that it is computationally inexpensive compared to free energy-based methods. However, we note that the predictions are not consistent for amino acids that are outside the active site, and there are no provisions in the methodology at this moment to address double or triple mutants.",

    "abstract": "Lead exposure threatens scavenging wildlife globally. For inexpensive estimation of lead concentration in bones from avian scavengers, portable X-ray fluorescence (XRF) devices have been trialed. However, portable XRF has not been validated for tissue lead measurement in non-human mammalian scavengers. We evaluated portable XRF for hair lead measurement in the endangered Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii). We first analyzed large ([~]1.0 g) hair samples from 39 deceased animals from southeastern Tasmania via portable XRF and then inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (validation study). We then measured lead concentrations via portable XRF only in 61 small ([~]0.1 g) hair samples from live devils from a plantation landscape (plantation study). Portable XRF measures of hair lead levels were positively correlated with ICP-MS values (R2 = 0.61). In the validation study, 95% of sampled Tasmanian devils had relatively low lead levels (< 2 mg/kg), but the remaining two showed elevated lead levels (> 15 mg/kg). Mean lead levels in the plantation study and validation study were not significantly different. Our preliminary results suggest that portable XRF can provide a useful measure of differences in lead levels in wildife hair over a coarse scale. We provide recommendations for further research and refinement of this method.\n\nSynopsisPortable XRF can provide inexpensive and non-destructive analysis of environmental contaminants in wildlife. We present the first evaluation of portable XRF for analysis of lead contamination in mammalian scavenger hair.",

    "abstract": "Asexual reproduction can be triggered by interspecific hybridization, but its emergence is supposedly rare, relying on exceptional combinations of suitable genomes. To examine how genomic and karyotype divergence between parental lineages affect the incidence of asexual gametogenesis, we experimentally hybridized fishes (Cobitidae) across a broad phylogenetic spectrum, assessed by whole exome data. Gametogenic pathways generally followed a continuum from sexual reproduction in hybrids between closely related evolutionary lineages to sterile or inviable crosses between distant lineages. However, most crosses resulted in a combination of sterile males and asexually-reproducing females. Their gametes usually experienced problems in chromosome pairing, but females also produced a certain proportion of oocytes with premeiotically duplicated genomes, enabling their development into clonal eggs. Interspecific hybridization may thus commonly affect cell cycles in a specific way, allowing the formation of unreduced oocytes. The emergence of asexual gametogenesis appears tightly linked to hybrid sterility and constitutes an inherent part of the extended speciation continuum.",

    "abstract": "Musical compositions are distinguished by their unique rhythmic patterns, determined by subtle differences in how regular beats are subdivided. Precise perception of these subdivisions is essential for discerning nuances in rhythmic patterns. While musical rhythm typically comprises sound elements with a variety of timbres or spectral cues, the impact of such spectral variations on the perception of rhythmic patterns remains unclear. Here, we show that consistency in spectral cues affects perceptual accuracy in discriminating subdivided rhythmic patterns. We conducted online experiments using rhythmic sound sequences consisting of band-passed noise bursts to measure discrimination accuracy. Participants were asked to discriminate between a swing-like rhythm sequence, characterized by a 2:1 interval ratio, and its more or less exaggerated version. This task was also performed under two additional rhythm conditions: inversed-swing rhythm (1:2 ratio) and regular subdivision (1:1 ratio). The center frequency of the band noises was either held constant or alternated between two values. Our results revealed a significant decrease in discrimination accuracy when the center frequency was alternated, irrespective of the rhythm ratio condition. This suggests that rhythm perception is not only shaped by temporal structure but also affected by spectral properties.",

    "abstract": "Highly potent animal stem cells either self renew or launch complex differentiation programs, using mechanisms that are only partly understood. Drosophila female germline stem cells (GSC) perpetuate without change over evolutionary time and generate cystoblast daughters that develop into nurse cells and oocytes. Cystoblasts initiate differentiation by generating a transient syncytial state, the germline cyst, and by increasing pericentromeric H3K9me3 modification, actions likely to suppress transposable element activity. Relatively open GSC chromatin is further restricted by Polycomb repression of testis or somatic cell-expressed genes briefly active in early female germ cells. Subsequently, Neijre/CBP and Myc help upregulate growth and reprogram GSC metabolism by altering mitochondrial transmembrane transport, gluconeogenesis and other processes. In all these respects GSC differentiation resembles development of the totipotent zygote. We propose that the totipotent stem cell state was shaped by the need to resist transposon activity over evolutionary time scales.",

    "abstract": "2Ionic current levels of identified neurons vary substantially across individual animals. Yet, under similar conditions, neural circuit output can be remarkably similar, as evidenced in many motor systems. All neural circuits are influenced by multiple neuromodulators which provide flexibility to their output. These neuromodulators often overlap in their actions by modulating the same channel type or synapse, yet have neuron-specific actions resulting from distinct receptor expression. Because of this different receptor expression pattern, in the presence of multiple convergent neuromodulators, a common downstream target would be activated more uniformly in circuit neurons across individuals. We therefore propose that a baseline tonic (non-saturating) level of comodulation by convergent neuromodulators can reduce interindividual variability of circuit output. We tested this hypothesis in the pyloric circuit of the crab, Cancer borealis. Multiple excitatory neuropeptides converge to activate the same voltage-gated current in this circuit, but different subsets of pyloric neurons have receptors for each peptide. We quantified the interindividual variability of the unmodulated pyloric circuit output by measuring the activity phases, cycle frequency and intraburst spike number and frequency. We then examined the variability in the presence of different combinations and concentrations of three neuropeptides. We found that at mid-level concentration (30 nM) but not at near-threshold (1 nM) or saturating (1 M) concentrations, comodulation by multiple neuropeptides reduced the circuit output variability. Notably, the interindividual variability of response properties of an isolated neuron was not reduced by comodulation, suggesting that the reduction of output variability may emerge as a network effect.\n\n3 Significance StatementNeuromodulation has been explored as a mechanism to provide flexibility to the output of neural circuits. All neural circuits are subject to neuromodulation by multiple substances. Here, we propose a different but complimentary role for neuromodulation. We use two general facts about neuromodulation to show that convergent comodulation at tonic mid-concentration levels reduces interindividual variability of neural circuit output. These facts are that 1) Multiple neuromodulators can have convergent actions on the same subcellular substrates and 2) Neurons express different neuromodulator receptors at different levels.",

    "abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is one of the most common heritable cardiovascular diseases and variants of TNNT2 (cardiac troponin T) are linked to increased risk of sudden cardiac arrest despite causing limited hypertrophy. In this study, a TNNT2 variant, R278C+/-, was generated in both human cardiac recombinant/reconstituted thin filaments (hcRTF) and human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to investigate the mechanisms by which the R278C+/- variant affects cardiomyocytes at the proteomic and functional levels. The results of proteomics analysis showed a significant upregulation of markers of cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling in R278C+/- vs. the isogenic control. Functional measurements showed that R278C+/- variant enhances the myofilament sensitivity to Ca2+, increases the kinetics of contraction, and causes arrhythmia at frequencies >75 bpm. This study uniquely shows the profound impact of the TNNT2 R278C+/- variant on the cardiomyocyte proteomic profile, cardiac electrical and contractile function in the early stages of cardiac development.\n\nTranslational PerspectiveHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the leading known cause of sudden cardiac arrest in the young. Thin-variant associated HCM variants make up to 15% of familial HCM yet their molecular mechanisms remain less clear relative to thick filament variants. Here, we employ computational modeling, human cardiac recombinant/reconstituted thin filaments (hcRTF), and hiPSC-CMs to study the thin filament TNNT2 R278C+/- variant, revealing its extensive pathogenicity and potential mechanisms by which it can lead to HCM and sudden death. Mavacamten, the recently FDA-approved treatment, was effective in alleviating contractile dysfunction in TNNT2 R278C+/- hiPSC-CMs, positing it as a potential therapy for thin filament HCM.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=117 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/542948v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@102a8b0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@190e356org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13d3f9aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a9c33_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Phylogenetic analysis of a unique panel of 23 primary tumor/patient-derived xenograft basal breast cancer revealed early evolution of chr4p deletion. Chr4p loss is associated with enhanced proliferation and immune evasion. We characterized an unknown gene, C4orf19, within chr4p, which suppressed proliferation when overexpressed and is a member of a novel PDCD10-GCKIII kinase module, and we refer to it as PGCA1. Genome-wide pooled overexpression screens using a barcoded library of human open reading frames, identified chromosomal regions, including chr4p, that suppress proliferation when overexpressed in a context-dependent manner.

    "abstract": "Bacterial communities undergoing spatial expansions, such as colonies and biofilms, typically exhibit a severe loss of genetic diversity due to gene surfing, a phenomenon by which only cells close to the expanding edge have a chance of contributing to the next generation. As a result, mutants that emerge behind the front will remain trapped in the bulk of the population, even if they carry a significant growth advantage. While these findings are applicable to smooth, uniformly dense colonies, where cell spatial re-arrangement is limited, it is unclear whether they hold in bacterial communities that display complex three-dimensional morphologies, such as wrinkly biofilms.\n\nWe employ an experimental procedure that enables a rapid switch of the chemical environment with minimal physical manipulation of the cell community to investigate the fate of trapped clones carrying a selective advantage in wrinkly B. subtilis biofilms. We find that these clones are able to use the channels underneath the wrinkles to traverse long distances and take over the expansion front. Moreover, we find that active motility is required to accomplish this task. Collectively, our findings reveal an intriguing novel role of wrinkles, as they enable potentially advantageous mutants to propel themselves towards the leading edge of the expansion and rescue the population upon environmental changes. Our results also point at motility, which has traditionally received little attention in bacterial communities growing on hard substrates, as a key mechanism for population rescue in biofilms that display complex morphologies.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) has rapidly emerged as a complementary tool to fluorescence imaging, as it provides an objective measure of cell morphology and dynamics, free of variability due to contrast agents. In particular, three-dimensional (3D) tomographic imaging of live cells has opened up new directions of investigation by providing systematic and correlative analysis of various cellular parameters without limitations of photobleaching and phototoxicity. While current QPI systems allow the rapid acquisition of tomographic images, the pipeline to analyze these raw 3D tomograms is not well-developed.

The current method employed for such tasks is the Otsu-based 3D watershed algorithm, which works well for isolated cells; however, it is very challenging to draw boundaries when the cells are clumped. This process is also memory intensive since the processing requires computation on a 3D stack of images. We report the CellSNAP (Cell Segmentation via Novel Algorithm for Phase Imaging) algorithm for the segmentation of QPI images, which outstrips the current gold standard in terms of speed, robustness, and implementation, achieving cell segmentation under 2 seconds per cell on a single-core processor. The implementation of CellSNAP can easily be parallelized on a multi-core system for further speed improvements. For the cases where segmentation is possible with the existing standard method, our algorithm displays an average difference of 5% for dry mass and 8% for volume measurements. We also show that CellSNAP can handle challenging image datasets where cells are clumped and marred by interferogram drifts, which pose major difficulties for all QPI-focused segmentation tools. We envision our work will lead to the broader adoption of QPI imaging for high-throughput analysis, which has, in part, been stymied by a lack of suitable image segmentation tools.",

    "abstract": "Marigold (Tagetes erecta L.) is a popular ornamental plant of the Asteraceae family, and its petals are considered the most abundant source of lutein. A low-continuity chromosome-level genome sequence of marigold was published recently, with poor annotation of the protein-coding genes, which hinders the studies of lutein biosynthesis. Here, we generated a near telomere-to-telomere level genome assembly of marigold based on highly accurate high-fidelity (HiFi) long reads and Hi-C sequencing data. Compared to the previously reported marigold genome, the current assembly had obviously higher contiguity and higher completeness of gene set. The current genome assembly has a 27-fold increase in contig N50 size, a 12.1% increase in chromosome anchoring rate, and a 9.0% increase in BUSCO complete rate for the gene set. Besides, the current assembly has much fewer assembly errors. Based on this high-quality genome assembly, we found that the 170-bp repeats are the most abundant centromeric unit and all centromeric regions are distributed along the whole chromosomes for all 12 centromeres, indicating the existence of the holocentromeres in marigold. In addition, we analyzed the structure and phylogenetic relationship of the four PSY genes, and revealed that these genes have diversified and possibly executed different functions in various tissues. Our near telomere-to-telomere level genome assembly and comprehensive gene annotation will greatly facilitate the breeding of marigold and researches aimed at improving lutein production.",

Through systematic genomic analyses of 501 disseminated SDSE strains, we demonstrate extensive overlap between the genomes of SDSE and S. pyogenes. More than 75% of core genes are shared between the two species with one third demonstrating evidence of cross-species recombination. Twenty-five percent of mobile genetic element (MGE) clusters and 16 of 55 SDSE MGE insertion regions were found across species. Assessing potential cross-protection from leading S. pyogenes vaccine candidates on SDSE, 12/34 preclinical vaccine antigen genes were shown to be present in >99% of isolates of both species. Relevant to possible vaccine evasion, six vaccine candidate genes demonstrated evidence of inter-species recombination.

    "abstract": "The inferior colliculus (IC) represents a crucial relay station in the auditory pathway, located in the midbrains tectum and primarily projecting to the thalamus. Despite the identification of distinct cell types based on various biomarkers in the IC, their specific contributions to the organization of auditory tectothalamic pathways have remained poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that IC neurons expressing parvalbumin (ICPV+) or somatostatin (ICSOM+) represent major, non-overlapping cell types throughout the three IC subdivisions. Strikingly, regardless of their location within the IC, these neurons predominantly project to the primary and secondary auditory thalamic nuclei, respectively. Retrograde tracing data specific to cell types indicate that ICPV+ neurons primarily receive auditory inputs, whereas ICSOM+ neurons integrate polymodal inputs that hold behavioral significance. Furthermore, ICPV+ neurons exhibit significant heterogeneity in both intrinsic electrophysiological properties and presynaptic terminal size compared to ICSOM+ neurons. Notably, approximately one quarter of ICPV+ neurons are inhibitory neurons, whereas all ICSOM+ neurons are excitatory neurons. Collectively, our findings suggest that parvalbumin and somatostatin expression in the IC can serve as biomarkers for two functionally distinct, parallel tectothalamic pathways. This discovery challenges the conventional IC subdivision-based definition of tectothalamic pathways and calls for a reassessment of their functional roles.",

    "abstract": "Despite decades of research, discovering causal relationships from purely observational neuroimaging data such as fMRI remains a challenge. Popular algorithms such as Multivariate Granger Causality (MVGC) and Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) fall short in handling complex aspects of data such as contemporaneous effects and latent common causes. Decades of research on causal structure learning have developed alternative algorithms that address these limitations, but they often scale poorly with the number of variables and rely heavily on the lack of cycles in the underlying graph. Further, how existing algorithms compare in terms of accuracy and scalability when applied to fMRI has remained unknown. In this work, we first provide a detailed analysis of existing methods, finding Runge et als PCMCI algorithm [1] and MVGC most accurate over simulated fMRI. However, neither algorithm is able to detect directed contemporaneous effects, a capability that is particularly important for fMRI. To address this gap, we propose the Causal discovery for Large-scale Low-resolution Time-series with Feedback (CaLLTiF) algorithm. This algorithm is based on PCMCI but improves upon it in terms of computational efficiency, cyclic contemporaneous connections, and statistical type I error control. CaLLTiF achieves significantly higher accuracy compared to existing algorithms in simulated fMRI. When applied to resting-state fMRI from human subjects (n = 200, Human Connectome Project), causal connectomes learned by CaLLTiF show higher sparsity and consistency across subjects than functional connectivity and align with known resting-state dynamics. These graphs also capture Euclidean distance-dependence in causal interactions, while demonstrating statistically significant laterality and gender differences. Overall, this work provides a clear picture of the critical gap between the capabilities of existing algorithms and the needs of causal discovery from whole-brain fMRI, and proposes a new algorithm with higher scalability and accuracy to address this gap. This study further paves the way and defines a standard for future investigations into causal discovery from neuroimaging data.",

Leveraging this phenomenon and the exceptionally fast endocytosis rate of TfR, we introduce Transferrin Receptor TArgeting Chimeras (TransTAC), a novel molecular archetype for membrane protein degradation in cancers and other cell types. TransTACs repurpose the naturally recycling receptor TfR1 for protein degradation. To accomplish this, we utilized a combination of protein engineering strategies to redirect the target protein from recycling-endosome trafficking to lysosomal degradation. We show that TransTACs can highly efficiently degrade a diverse range of single-pass, multi-pass, native, or synthetic membrane proteins, establishing new possibilities for targeted cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "Living cells are complex entities that perform many different complex tasks with astonishing robustness. While the direct dependence of biological processes on controlled protein expression is well established, we only begin to understand how intracellular mechanical characteristics guide and support biological function. This is in stark contrast to the expected functional role that intracellular mechanical properties should have for many core cellular functions such as organization, homeostasis and transport. From a mechanical point of view, cells are complex viscoelastic materials that are continuously driven out of thermodynamic equilibrium, which makes both a physical measurement and mathematical modeling of its properties difficult. Here, we define a \"mechanical fingerprint\" that can not only characterize the intracellular mechanical state, but also carve out the mechanical differences between cell types with the potential to relate these to proper cell function. By analyzing the frequency-dependent viscoelastic properties and intracellular activity of cells using microrheology, we distilled the complex active mechanical state into just 6 parameters that comprise the mechanical fingerprint. The systematic investigation of the fingerprint illustrates a parameter tuning that can be explained by the functional cellular requirements. However, the full potential of the mechanical fingerprint is given by a statistical analysis of its parameters across all investigated cell types, which suggests that cells adjust mechanical parameters in a correlated way to position their intracellular mechanical properties within a well defined phase-space that is spanned between activity, mechanical resistance and fluidity. This paves the way for a systematic study of the interdependence of biological function and intracellular active mechanics.",

    "abstract": "We studied diverse prenylated intrinsically disordered regions (PIDRs) of Ras and Rho family small GTPases using long timescale atomistic molecular dynamics simulations in an asymmetric model membrane of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylserine (PS) lipids. We show that conformational plasticity is a key determinant of lipid sorting by polybasic PIDRs and provide evidence for lipid sorting based on both headgroup and acyl chain structures. We further show that conformational ensemble-based lipid recognition is generalizable to all polybasic PIDRs, and that the sequence outside the polybasic domain (PBD) modulates the conformational plasticity, bilayer adsorption, and interactions of PIDRs with membrane lipids. Specifically, we found that palmitoylation, the ratio of basic to acidic residues, and the hydrophobic content of the sequence outside the PBD significantly impact the diversity of conformational substates and hence the extent of conformation-dependent lipid interactions. We thus propose that the PBD is required but not sufficient for the full realization of lipid sorting by prenylated PBD-containing membrane anchors, and that the membrane anchor is not only responsible for high affinity membrane binding but also directs the protein to the right target membrane where it participates in lipid sorting.",

    "abstract": "Multivalent proteins undergo coupled segregative and associative phase transitions. Phase separation, a segregative transition, is driven by macromolecular solubility, and this leads to coexisting phases above system-specific saturation concentrations. Percolation is a continuous transition that is driven by multivalent associations among cohesive motifs. Contributions from percolation are highlighted by the formation of heterogeneous distributions of clusters in sub-saturated solutions, as was recently reported for Fused in sarcoma (FUS) and FET family proteins. Here, we show that clustering and phase separation are defined by a separation of length- and energy-scales. This is unmasked when glutamate is the primary solution anion. Glutamate is preferentially excluded from protein sites, and this enhances molecular associations. Differences between glutamate and chloride are manifest at ultra-low protein concentrations. These differences are amplified as concentrations increase, and they saturate as the micron-scale is approached. Therefore, condensate formation in supersaturated solutions and clustering in sub-saturated are governed by distinct energy and length scales. Glutamate, unlike chloride, is the dominant intracellular anion, and the separation of scales, which is masked in chloride, is unmasked in glutamate. Our work highlights how components of cellular milieus and sequence-encoded interactions contribute to amplifying distinct contributions from associative versus segregative phase transitions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is an aggressive clinical subtype of breast cancer often diagnosed in young women. Lymph node and distant metastases are frequently detected at diagnosis of IBC, and improvements in systemic therapies are needed. For IBC that lack hormone or HER2 expression, no targeted therapies are available. Since the phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase (PI3K) pathway is frequently deregulated in IBC, some studies have tested the pan PI3K inhibitor Buparlisib (BKM120). Although the SUM149 IBC cell line was resistant to Buparlisib, a functional genomic screen showed that silencing of Aurora kinase A (AURKA) sensitized cells to killing by Buparlisib. In this study, we tested whether combination treatments of PI3K and AURKA inhibitors act synergistically to kill IBC cells and tumors.\n\nMethodsSUM149 cells were treated with increasing doses of PI3K inhibitor Buparlisib (BKM120) and AURKA inhibitor Alisertib as monotherapies or combination therapies. Effects on target pathways, cytotoxicity, cell cycle, soft agar colony growth and cell migration were analyzed. The individual and combined treatments were also tested in a mammary orthotopic SUM149 tumor xenograft model to measure effects on tumor growth and metastasis\n\nResultsThe SUM149 IBC cell line treated with Buparlisib showed reduced PI3K/AKT activation but no significant skewing of cell cycle progression. Parallel studies of Alisertib treatment showed that AURKA inhibition led to a significant block in G2/M transition in SUM149 cells. In cytotoxicity assays, Buparlisib and Alisertib combination treatments were highly synergistic compared to monotherapy controls. Evidence of synergy between Buparlisib and Alisertib also extended to soft agar colony growth and wound healing motility in SUM149 cells. The combination of Buparlisib and Alisertib also reduced IBC tumor growth in mammary orthotopic xenograft assays and reduced spontaneous metastases development in lung tissue.\n\nConclusionsAlthough SUM149 IBC cells were relatively resistant to killing by the PI3K inhibitor Buparlisib, our study showed that co-targeting the mitotic kinase AURKA with Alisertib synergized to limit IBC cell growth and motility, as well as IBC tumor growth and metastasis.",

Sleep apnoea holds a bidirectional relationship with hypertension which drives atherosclerosis, ultimately culminating in vascular dementia. To enable a better understanding of this sequalae of events, we investigated innate sleep apnoea in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), which have a range of cardiovascular disorders. SHRs displayed a higher degree of sleep disordered breathing, which emanates from poor vascular health leading to a loss of preBotC neurons. This model also displays small vessel white matter disease, a form of vascular dementia, likely associated with neuroinflammation in the hippocampus and the related deficits in both long- and short-term memory. Therefore, hypertension induces sleep apnoea through vascular damage in the respiratory column, culminating in neuronal loss in the inspiratory oscillator. This induction of sleep apnoea which in turn will independently exacerbate hypertension and neural inflammation, increasing the rate of vascular dementia.",

    "abstract": "In the context of global warming, it is crucial to focus on the effects of temperature on the emergence of new lineages of endemic pathogen species, such as Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) the causal agent of yellow rust on wheat. We characterized the thermal aptitude of representative isolates from the most recent common European Pst races. We assessed two key aggressiveness components - infection efficiency (IE) and latency period (LP) - under warm and cold thermal regimes, comparing 10 Pst isolates collected from 2010 to 2020 with three \"old\" reference isolates. The significant differences observed suggest that this species has the potential to adapt to temperature changes, but that such adaptation probably did not drive the establishment of the most recent races and the dominant  Warrior and  Warrior(-) they succeeded. These races display \"generalist\" behavior with respect to temperature, with  Warrior(-) showing no more aggressiveness than the races replaced since the 1990s. The differences in competitive success between emerging Pst lineages are probably due to the deployment of resistance genes in wheat and the advantages of new forms of virulence emerging independently of thermal adaptability. However, variations in thermal adaptability for both aggressiveness components suggested an impact of geographic origin within the  Warrior and  Warrior(-) races, as previously reported for the \"old\" reference isolates. Furthermore, the independence of thermal adaptability established for IE and LP implies that the effects of temperature may depend on the stage of the epidemic (early or late), potentially modifying seasonal dynamics.",

Given the role of wood in carbon and nutrient cycling, this will provide valuable insights for forest growth and carbon cycling globally.

We assessed the microbiome of outer and inner bark, cambium tissue, year 2-8 wood increments, and the pith of 11 Pinus radiata trees, a widely planted, model conifer species. Diverse prokaryotic and fungal microbiomes were present in all trees, with communities structured by tissue type (p<0.001). Inner and outer bark tissues had high richness and the most distinct communities. Microbiome richness was lowest in year 2 through to year 8 wood, and the communities in these samples had similar composition. Prokaryote communities were dominated by Alpha-Beta-, and Gamma-proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes (Clostridia and Bacilli). Within fungal communities, Sordariomycetes comprised over 90% of the taxa present. Microbiomes of cambial and pith tissues were distinct to those niches. Overall, we provide further support that the wood of conifers is host to distinct microbiome communities. Microbiomes in these niches are profoundly placed to impact tree physiology, health, and fitness, through to ecosystem function and global carbon cycles.",

    "abstract": "Active nutrient uptake is fundamental for survival and pathogenicity of Gram-negative bacteria, which operate a multi-protein Ton system to transport essential nutrients like metals and vitamins. This system harnesses the proton motive force at the inner membrane to energize the import through the outer membrane, but the mechanism of energy transfer remains enigmatic. Here, we study the periplasmic domain of ExbD, a crucial component of the proton channel of the Ton system. We show that this domain is a dynamic dimer switching between two conformations representing the proton channels open and closed states. By in vivo phenotypic assays we demonstrate that this conformational switch is essential for the nutrient uptake by bacteria. The open state of ExbD triggers a disorder to order transition of TonB, enabling TonB to supply energy to the nutrient transporter. We also reveal the anchoring role of the peptidoglycan layer in this mechanism. Herein, we propose a mechanistic model for the Ton system, emphasizing ExbD duality and the pivotal catalytic role of peptidoglycan. Sequence analysis suggests that this mechanism is conserved in other systems energizing gliding motility and membrane integrity. Our study fills important gaps in understanding bacterial motor mechanism and proposes novel antibacterial strategies.",

    "abstract": "Global trends show an increase in microbial infections caused by pathogens resistant to the most common antibiotics. Antibiotics in development are usually tested on rapidly dividing cells in a culture medium and do not reflect complexity of infections in vivo, while testing in vivo is limited, expensive and ethically concerning. This often results in development and subsequent prescription of antibiotics only targeting infections in which pathogens are undergoing rapid cell division and in case of persistent infections like keratitis leads to poor clinical outcomes such as impaired vision or loss of an eye. In this study, we demonstrate antibiotic tolerance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains PAO1 and PA14 using the ex vivo porcine keratitis model in which bacterial physiology more closely mimics infections in vivo than in a culture medium. MBEC and MIC was used as a guideline to establish concentration of applied antibiotics on tissue. Infected ex vivo porcine corneas were treated with therapeutically relevant concentrations of gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin and fusidic acid. Ciprofloxacin was the most potent across all tests demonstrating a positive correlation with MIC but not MBEC. Nonetheless, the results demonstrated that MIC and MBEC concentrations were not sufficient to clear infection even after 18 hours of continuous exposure to the tested antibiotics reflecting the need for novel antibiotics that can target the persistent subpopulation of these pathogens and the ability of the ex vivo keratitis model to be a relevant platform to identify novel antibiotics with suitable activities. There was a clear visual distinction between corneas infected with cytotoxic strain PA14 and invasive strain PAO1. In this study both strains PA14 and PAO1 showed a high level of antibiotic tolerance, which suggests that in clinical settings the treatment approach could be similar regardless of the causative strain.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation in many cellular functions and are highly conserved throughout evolution. In teleost fish species, miRNAs are believed to play a role in the reproductive system, but more research is needed to better understand the functions of miRNAs in fish gonads. Furthermore, miR-210 has previously been described to be involved in many processes, such as hypoxia response, angiogenesis, cell proliferation and male infertility. The aim of this study was, first, to develop an in vitro model in fish to study the functions of miRNAs and second, to identify target genes of dre-miR-210-5p by establishing a primary ovarian cell culture in zebrafish (Danio rerio). The cell culture was performed by isolating ovaries from adult female fish (n=4) which were incubated with dre-miR-210-5p mimic or scramble miRNA mimic. Cell survival was studied by flow cytometry analysis and fluorescent microscopy. Following, the effect of dre-miR-210-5p on ovarian cells was uncovered by RNA-sequencing, identifying [~]6,000 targeted-genes differentially expressed (DEGs), of which [~]2,600 downregulated and [~]3,400 upregulated. GO term and KEGG pathway analyses showed downregulated genes involved in cell cycle processes and reproduction-related pathways while, in contrast, immune-related pathways were upregulated after miR-210 mimic treatment in the ovarian cells. To provide the molecular mechanisms triggered by miRNA-210, seed regions of targeted genes were identified and in silico analysis classified DEGs as potential biomarkers in reproduction or immune cell types. These results support the crosstalk between the reproductive and immune system in which dre-miR-210-5p plays a key role in the transcriptomic alteration in the fish ovaries.\n\nTake home messagemiR-210 promotes the immune response and suppresses oocyte meiosis in the ovarian cells in zebrafish",

    "abstract": "The gut and brain are increasingly linked in human disease, with neuropsychiatric conditions classically attributed to the brain showing an involvement of the intestine and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) displaying an ever-expanding list of neurological comorbidities. To identify molecular systems that underpin this gut-brain connection and thus discover therapeutic targets, experimental models of gut dysfunction must be evaluated for brain effects. In the present study, we examine disturbances along the gut-brain axis in a widely used murine model of colitis, the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model, using high-throughput transcriptomics and an unbiased network analysis strategy coupled with standard biochemical outcome measures to achieve a comprehensive approach to identify key disease processes in both colon and brain. We examine the reproducibility of colitis induction with this model and its resulting genetic programs during different phases of disease, finding that DSS-induced colitis is largely reproducible with a few site-specific molecular features. We focus on the circulating immune system as the intermediary between the gut and brain, which exhibits an activation of pro-inflammatory innate immunity during colitis. Our unbiased transcriptomics analysis provides supporting evidence for immune activation in the brain during colitis, suggests that myelination may be a process vulnerable to increased intestinal permeability, and identifies a possible role for oxidative stress and brain oxygenation. Overall, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of multiple systems in a prevalent experimental model of intestinal permeability, which will inform future studies using this model and others, assist in the identification of druggable targets in the gut-brain axis, and contribute to our understanding of the concomitance of intestinal and neuropsychiatric dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "The inflammatory response at the spinal cord injury (SCI) epicenter and heightened macrophage presence in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) has been well characterized after SCI and correlates with neuropathic pain. CCL2, a chemokine that acts as a macrophage chemoattractant and neuromodulator, is implicated in pain development, however, the role of the CCL2-CCR2 axis in the development of pain after SCI has not been explored. Here, we examined the role of CCL2-CCR2 signaling in macrophage recruitment to the DRG as well as the prolonged presence of macrophages in the DRG on the development and persistence of pain after SCI. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats received a moderate, unilateral C5 contusion. Sandwich ELISA revealed that CCL2 is upregulated in the ipsilesional C7 and C8 DRGs in the first 24 hours post injury (hpi) and returns to naive levels by 72 hpi. To prevent monocyte-derived macrophage recruitment to the DRG, additional SCI rats received vehicle or INCB3344, a CCR2 antagonist, intravenously at the time of SCI and at 24 and 48 hpi. INCB3344 administration induced transient forepaw allodynia at 7dpi in nearly all rats (88%) compared to only 33% in vehicle controls that resolves partially by 28 dpi, as measured by von Frey and mechanical conflict avoidance paradigms. As expected, qPCR analyses of whole DRG revealed that INCB3344 reduced macrophage markers and inflammatory cytokines in the ipsilesional C7 and C8 DRGs at 7 dpi compared to vehicle treated rats. By 28 dpi, there were no significant differences between INCB3344 or vehicle-treated groups, indicating that SCI-induced macrophage presence in the DRG is delayed by INCB3344 treatment. Moreover, gene expression of markers of macrophage polarity and cytokines suggest a pro-inflammatory environment in the DRG at 28dpi. DRG macrophage ablation via liposomal clodronate at 21dpi did not ameliorate hypersensitive pain behavior, though their ablation did reduce paw withdrawal thresholds in SCI rats that did not previously demonstrate pain behavior. Collectively, these data suggest that driving macrophages to a pro-reparative phenotype may be a viable and effective analgesic strategy that acts by modulating both the immune response and the experience of pain.",

    "abstract": "Early-life adversity causes reduced hippocampal volume and abnormal hippocampal connectivity and function, with evidence indicating more prominent deficits in males compared to females. Reelin-positive projections from the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) to the dorsal hippocampus are essential for encoding contextual and semantic memories in diverse mammalian species, including humans and rodents. However, the impact of early-life adversity on these projections and their contribution to hippocampal-dependent deficits have not been reported. Using a modified limited bedding (LB) mouse model of early adversity that extends the impoverished conditions from birth to postnatal day 25 (P25), we found severe impairment in contextual fear conditioning for adolescent LB male but not LB female mice. Using retrograde tracing, we found that the number of reeling-positive projections from the LEC to the dorsal hippocampus is significantly reduced in LB males but not LB females. Further, the number of projections was highly correlated with deficits in contextual memory and hypomyelination in perforant pathway terminals located in the dorsal hippocampus. Ex vivo high-resolution diffusion magnetic resonance imaging confirmed reduced structural connectivity between the entorhinal cortex and the dorsal hippocampus and revealed extensive cortical atrophy that resembled abnormalities reported in children exposed to severe deprivation. Given the essential role that reelin-positive projections play in contextual memory, these findings suggest a novel mechanism to explain the pronounced contextual memory deficits seen in LB males.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionBrain Age Gap (BAG) is defined as the difference between the brains predicted age and the chronological age of an individual. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based BAG can quantify acceleration of brain aging, and is used to measure brain health as aging and disease interact. Motion in the scanner is a common occurrence that can affect the acquired MRI data and act as a major confound in the derived models. As such, age-related changes in head motion may impact the observed age-related differences. However, the relationship between head motion and BAG has not been directly examined. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of motion on voxel-based morphometry (VBM) based BAG.\n\nMethodsData were obtained from two sources: i) T1-weighted (T1w) MRIs from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (CamCAN) were used to train the brain age prediction model, and ii) T1w MRIs from the Movement-related artifacts (MR-ART) dataset were used to assess the impact of motion on BAG. MR-ART includes one motion-free and two motion-affected (one low and one high) 3D T1w MRIs. We also visually rated the motion levels of the MR-ART MRIs from 0 to 5, with 0 meaning no motion and 5 high motion levels. All images were pre-processed through a standard VBM pipeline. GM density across cortical and subcortical regions were then used to train the brain age prediction model and assess the relationship between BAG and MRI motion. Principal component analysis was used to perform dimension reduction and extract the VBM-based features. BAG was estimated by regressing out the portion of delta age explained by chronological age. Linear mixed effects models were used to investigate the relationship between BAG and motion session as well as motion severity, including participant IDs as random effects.\n\nResultsIn contrast with the session with no induced motion, predicted delta age was significantly higher for high motion sessions (t-value = 5.06, p < 0.0001), with marginal effect for low motion sessions (t-value = 1.95, p = 0.051). In addition, delta age was significantly associated with motion severity as evaluated by visual rating (t = 4.46, p < 0.0001).\n\nConclusionMotion in the scanner can significantly impact brain age estimates, and needs to be accounted for as a confound, particularly when studying populations that are known to have higher levels of motion in the scanner. These results have significant implications for brain age studies in aging and neurodegeneration. Based on these findings, we recommend assessment and inclusion of visual motion ratings in such studies.",

    "abstract": "Many physical processes display complex high-dimensional time-varying behavior, from global weather patterns to brain activity. An outstanding challenge is to express high dimensional data in terms of a dynamical model that reveals their spatiotemporal structure. Dynamic Mode Decomposition is a means to achieve this goal, allowing the identification of key spatiotemporal modes through the diagonalization of a finite dimensional approximation of the Koopman operator. However, DMD methods apply best to time-translationally invariant or stationary data, while in many typical cases, dynamics vary across time and conditions. To capture this temporal evolution, we developed a method, Non-Stationary Dynamic Mode Decomposition (NS-DMD), that generalizes DMD by fitting global modulations of drifting spatiotemporal modes. This method accurately predicts the temporal evolution of modes in simulations and recovers previously known results from simpler methods. To demonstrate its properties, the method is applied to multi-channel recordings from an awake behaving non-human primate performing a cognitive task.",

    "abstract": "Chloroplast biogenesis is dependent on master regulators from the Golden2-like (GLK) family of transcription factors, but higher order glk mutants contain residual chlorophyll and therefore other proteins must also be involved. Here we identify MYB-related transcription factors as regulators of chloroplast biogenesis in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha and angiosperm Arabidopsis thaliana. In both species, double mutant alleles in MYB-Related genes show very limited chloroplast development and photosynthesis gene expression is perturbed to a greater extent than mutants of GLK. In M. polymorpha MYB-related genes act upstream of GLK, while in A. thaliana this relationship has been rewired. In both species, genes encoding enzymes of chlorophyll biosynthesis are controlled by both MYB-related and GLK proteins whilst those allowing CO2 fixation, photorespiration as well as photosystem assembly and repair require the MYB-related proteins. Thus, MYB-related and GLK genes have overlapping as well as distinct targets. We conclude that MYB-related transcription factors act with GLK to orchestrate chloroplast development in land plants.",

    "abstract": "Integrating genetic information into dynamical models is key to understand variations among genotypes and improve crop performances face to current agronomic and ecological constraints. A first and necessary step in building gene-to-phenotype models is the calibration of a large number of genotypes. We compared here two different strategies for the calibration of an Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) kinetic model simulating the accumulation of different sugars during peach fruit development. First, the model was calibrated for each genotype independently using a Genotype-Based (GB) strategy. Two formulations of the problem have been tested, either as a Single-Objective Optimization (GBS) problem or as a Multi-Objective Optimization (GBM) problem. Second, the model was calibrated for all genotypes simultaneously using a Population-Based (PB) strategy. The two strategies were first applied to a set of simulated data and then to a real dataset derived from an interspecific population of 106 peach genotypes. Results showed that the GB strategy allowed for a high goodness of fit for most genotypes, especially in the GBS formulation. However, the estimated parameters suffered from a lack of practical identifiability as independent repetitions of the estimation algorithm did not always converge to the same value for most genotypes. The PB calibration strategy overcame this issue showing a good identifiability of the population parameter values, a goodness of fit comparable to the one obtained with the GB strategy and a good characterisation of parameter variations within the progeny, which is a key to assess the inter-individual genetic variability. These results are an important step towards the development of reliable gene-to-phenotype models.",

    "abstract": "BBX proteins are B-Box zinc finger proteins that can act as transcription factors and regulators of protein complexes. Several BBX proteins play important roles in plant development. Two Arabidopsis thaliana microProteins belonging to the BBX family, named miP1a and miP1b, homotypically interact with and modulate the activity of other BBX proteins, including CONSTANS (AtCO), which transcriptionally activates the florigen gene, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). In tomato, the closest homologs of miP1a and miP1b are the microProteins SlBBX16 and SlBBX17. To deepen our understanding of the role of tomato microProteins in flowering, we constitutively expressed SlBBX16/17 in Arabidopsis and tomato (MicroTom) and examined possible interacting partners. Overexpression of the two tomato microProteins in Arabidopsis caused a delay in the flowering transition; however, the effect was weaker than that observed in Arabidopsis plants overexpressing the native miP1a/b microProteins. In tomato, overexpression of SlBBX17 prolonged the flowering period; this effect was accompanied by downregulation of the flowering inhibitor Self Pruning. Yeast-Two Hybrid analysis did not show a direct interaction between SlBBX16 and SlBBX17 and AtCO and its closest homolog in tomato, SlCOL1. On the other hand, SlBBX16 and SlBBX17 were able to hetero-oligomerize with TCMP-2, a cystine-knot peptide involved in flowering pattern and fruit development in tomato. Increasing the expression of both tomato microProteins also caused alterations in fruit development: overexpression of SlBBX17 resulted in a diminished number and size of ripe fruits as compared to WT plants, while overexpression of SlBBX16 caused delayed fruit production up to the breaker stage. These effects were associated with changes in the expression of genes regulating gibberellin content.",

    "abstract": "Hallucinatory experiences, defined as perception in the absence of external stimuli, can occur in both pathological and non-pathological states and can be broadly phenomenologically divided into those of a simple and a complex nature. Non-pathological visual hallucinations can be induced experimentally using a variety of stimulation conditions. To assess whether these techniques drive a shared underlying hallucinatory mechanism, despite these differences, we compared two methods: flicker and perceptual deprivation (Ganzfeld). Specifically, we measured the frequency and complexity of the hallucinations produced by these techniques. We utilised button press, retrospective drawing, interviews, and questionnaires to quantify hallucinatory experience in 20 participants. With both experimental techniques, we found that simple hallucinations were more common than complex hallucinations. We also found that on average, flicker was more effective than Ganzfeld at eliciting a higher number of hallucinations, though Ganzfeld hallucinations were longer than flicker hallucinations. There was no interaction between experimental condition and hallucination complexity, suggesting that the increased bottom-up visual input in flicker increased both simple and complex hallucinations similarly. A correlation was observed between the total proportional time spent hallucinating in flicker and Ganzfeld, which was replicated in a retrospective questionnaire measure of experienced intensity, suggesting a shared hallucinatory mechanism between the two methodologies. We attribute these findings to a shared low-level core hallucinatory mechanism, such as excitability of visual cortex, which is amplified in flicker compared to Ganzfeld due to heightened bottom-up input.",

    "abstract": "By analyzing 1771 RNA-seq datasets from seven tissues in a maize diversity panel, we explored the landscape of multi-tissue transcriptome variation and evolution patterns of tissue-specific genes, and built a comprehensive multi-tissue gene regulation atlas to understand the genetic regulation of maize complex trait. Using transcriptome-wide association analysis, we linked tissue-specific expression variation of 45 genes to variation of 11 agronomic traits. Through integrative analyses of tissue-specific gene regulatory variation with genome-wide association studies, we detected relevant tissue types and candidate genes for a number of agronomic traits, including leaf during the day for anthesis-silking interval (GRMZM2G093210), leaf during the day for kernel Zeinoxanthin level (GRMZM2G143202), and root for ear height (GRMZM2G700665), highlighting the contribution from tissue-specific gene expression to variation of agronomic trait. Our findings provide novel insights into the genetic and biological mechanisms underlying complex traits in maize, and the multi-tissue regulatory atlas serves as a primary source for biological interpretation, functional validation, and genomic improvement of maize.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus, GBS) is a major pathogen of humans and animals, posing a threat to human health as well as food security. Here, we investigate the role of genomic mechanisms, including homologous recombination and horizontal gene transfer, in shaping the population structure of GBS and its adaptation to three major host groups (humans, cattle, fishes). We demonstrate that the GBS population comprises host-specialist, host-adapted lineages as well as host generalists, and that these categories differ in their level or recombination. Although the accessory genome at large varies by lineage rather than host, genome wide association studies show that host association is driven by three accessory genome clusters, regardless of lineage or breadth of the host spectrum. These genomic clusters (scpB in human GBS, lactose operon in bovine GBS, Locus 3 in fish GBS) are known (scpB, Lac.2) or shown here (Locus 3) to be functionally relevant and are shared with other streptococcal species occupying the same host niche. These findings demonstrate the importance of considering the role of non-human host species in the evolution of GBS, including high risk clones that may lead to interspecies transmission and affect efficacy of future GBS vaccines.",

We intravenously injected MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells and A375 human melanoma cells into mice with severe combined immunodeficiency and observed that the cells died upon reaching the lungs, and released cfChPs that accumulated in the lung cell nuclei at 48 h. We detected the activation of 10 hallmarks of cancer and immune checkpoints in lung cells at 72 h, suggesting that the lung cells had rapidly transformed into incipient cancer cells. Metaphase preparations and single-cell clones developed from cell cultures of lung metastases that subsequently developed contained chimeric chromosomes of both mouse and human DNA, and the cells co-expressed both human- and mouse-specific proteins. Intravenous injection of purified cfChPs isolated from radiation-killed MDA-MB-231 cells induced lung metastasis containing chimeric chromosomes and co-expressing proteins, providing direct evidence that cfChPs are involved in metastasis induction.

Here, we engineer a set of protease-based biohybrid modules the bioactivity of which can either be induced or inhibited. Guided by a quantitative mathematical model and following a design-build-test-learn cycle, we wire the modules according to circuit topologies inspired by electronic signal decoders, a fundamental motif in information processing. We design a 2-input/4-output binary decoder for the detection of two small molecules in a material framework that could perform regulated outputs in form of distinct protease activities.

    "abstract": "The fast-growing microbe Vibrio natriegens is capable of natural transformation where it draws DNA in from media via an active process under physiological conditions. Using an engineered strain with a genomic copy of the master competence regulator tfoX from Vibrio cholera in combination with a new minimal competence media (MCM) that uses acetate as an energy source, we demonstrate naturally competent cells which are created, transformed, and recovered entirely in the same media, without exchange or addition of new media. Cells are naturally competent to plasmids, recombination with linear DNA, and co-transformation of both to select for scarless and markerless genomic edits. The entire process is simple and inexpensive, requiring no capital equipment for an entirely room temperature process (Zero Capital protocol, 104 cfu/{micro}g), or just an incubator (High Efficiency protocol, 105-6 cfu/{micro}g). These cells retain their naturally competent state when frozen and are transformable immediately upon thawing like a typical chemical or electrochemical competent cell. Since the optimized transformation protocol requires only 50 minutes of hands-on time, and V. natriegens grows quickly even on plates, a transformation started at 9 AM yields abundant culturable single colonies by 5 PM. Further, because all stages of transformation occur in the same media, and the process can be arbitrarily scaled in volume, this natural competence strain and media could be ideal for automated directed evolution applications. As a result, naturally competent V. natriegens could compete with E. coli as an excellent chassis for low-cost and highly scalable synthetic biology.",

Here, we engineered a synthetic Escherichia coli coculture with the compartmentalized sugar utilization and ester biosynthesis pathways to produce isobutyl butyrate from a mixture of glucose and xylose. To compartmentalize the sugar-utilizing pathway submodules, we engineered a xylose-utilizing E. coli specialist that selectively consumes xylose over glucose and bypasses the carbon catabolite repression (CCR) while leveraging the native CCR machinery to activate a glucose-utilizing E. coli specialist. Upon compartmentalizing the isobutyl butyrate pathway submodules into these sugar-utilizing specialist cells, a robust synthetic coculture could be engineered to selectively produce isobutyl butyrate at a level of 392 mg/L, about 31-fold higher than the monoculture.",

Boosting actomyosin-II activity alleviates axon degeneration in mice with traumatic brain injury.\n\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a significant and unmet health challenge. However, our understanding of how neurons, particularly their fragile axons, withstand the abrupt mechanical impacts within the central nervous system remains largely unknown. Using a microfluidic device applying discrete levels of transverse forces to axons, we identified the stress levels that most axons could resist and explored their instant responses at nanoscale resolution. Mild stress induces rapid and reversible axon beading, driven by actomyosin-II-dependent radial contraction, which restricts the spreading and bursting of stress-induced Ca2+ waves. More severe stress causes irreversible focal swelling and Ca2+ overload, ultimately leading to focal axonal swelling and degeneration. Up-regulating actomyosin-II activity prevented the progression of initial injury in vivo, protecting commissural axons from degeneration in a mice TBI model. Our study established a scalable axon injury model and uncovered the critical roles of actomyosin-II in shielding neurons against detrimental mechanical stress.",

Variants in the gene encoding alpha-galactosidase A may lead to impaired enzyme activity with cellular accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3). To study the underlying pathomechanism of Fabry-associated small fibre neuropathy, we generated a neuronal in vitro disease model using patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells from three Fabry patients and one healthy control. We further generated an isogenic control line via CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. We subjected iPSC to targeted peripheral neuronal differentiation and observed intra-lysosomal Gb3 accumulations in somas and neurites of Fabry sensory neurons using super-resolution microscopy. At functional level, patch-clamp analysis revealed a hyperpolarizing shift of voltage-gated sodium channel steady-state inactivation kinetics in Fabry cell lines as compared to the healthy control. Moreover, we demonstrate a drastic increase in Fabry sensory neuron Ca2+ levels at 39{degrees}C mimicking clinical fever (p < 0.001). This pathophysiological phenotype was accompanied by thinning of neurite calibres in sensory neurons obtained from Fabry patients compared to healthy control cells (p < 0.001). Linear-Nonlinear cascade models fit to spiking responses revealed that Fabry cell lines exhibit altered single neuron encoding properties relative to control. We further observed jam of mitochondrial trafficking at sphingolipid accumulations within Fabry sensory neurites utilizing a click-chemistry approach together with mitochondrial dysmorphism compared to healthy control cells. We pioneer insights into the cellular mechanisms contributing to pain, thermal hyposensitivity, and denervation in Fabry small fibre neuropathy, and pave the way for further mechanistic in vitro studies in Fabry disease and the development of novel treatment approaches.",

Human and zebrafish lymphocyte types are conserved, but many aspects of zebrafish lymphocyte biology remain uninvestigated, including lymphocytes in peripheral tissues, like epidermis. Here, we report the first study focused on zebrafish scale epidermal lymphocytes. Zebrafish scales represent a source to longitudinally sample live fish. We developed a novel biopsy technique, collecting scales to analyze epithelial lymphocytes from several fluorescently-labeled lines. We imaged scales via confocal microscopy and demonstrated multiple lymphocyte types in scales/epidermis, quantifying them flow cytometrically. We profiled gene expression of scale, thymic, and marrow lymphocytes from the same animals, revealing B- and T-lineage signatures. Single-cell qRT-PCR and RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) show not only canonical B and T cells, but also novel lymphocyte populations not described previously. To validate longitudinal scale biopsies, we serially sampled scales from fish treated with dexamethasone (DXM), demonstrating epidermal lymphocyte responses. To analyze cells functionally, we employed a bead-ingestion assay, showing thymic, marrow, and epidermal lymphocytes have phagocytic activity. In summary, we establish a non-lethal technique to obtain zebrafish lymphocytes, providing the first quantification, expression profiling, and functional data from epidermal lymphocytes in the zebrafish model.\n\nSummaryThis study describes a new biopsy method to acquire zebrafish lymphocytes for ex vivo studies, without euthanasia.

    "abstract": "Microbial composition and diversity in marine sediments are shaped by environmental, biological, and anthropogenic processes that operate on different scales. However, our understanding of benthic microbial biogeography remains limited. Here, we study how benthic microbiota vary at a regional scale in the North Sea with sediment characteristics, temperature, organic matter content, shear bed stress and bottom trawling intensity, a prevalent industrial fishing practice which heavily impacts benthic ecosystems. Using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing, we characterized benthic microbiota from the top centimeter of 349 sediment samples and used uni-and multivariate statistical models, accounting for spatial autocorrelation, to disentangle the effects of the different predictors. Fitted models demonstrate how the geographic interplay of different environmental anthropogenic drivers shapes the structure and functioning of benthic microbial communities. Sediment properties were the primary determinants, with diversity increasing with sediment permeability but at the same time increasing with mud content, highlighting different underlying processes. Alpha diversity also increased nonlinearly with total organic matter content and temperature and showed a more complex relationship with bottom shear stress but decreased with bottom trawling intensity. These trawling associated diversity changes were accompanied by shifts in functional groups related to energy metabolism. Specifically, with increasing trawling intensity, we observed a transition toward more aerobic heterotrophic and less denitrifying metabolism. Our findings provide first insights of benthic microbial biogeographic patterns on a large spatial scale and illustrate how anthropogenic activity such as bottom trawling may influence the distribution and abundances of microbes and overall benthic metabolism at macroecological scales.",

    "abstract": "Insect pollinators play a crucial role in global crop production, enhancing fruit and seed yield, improving fruit quality, and increasing crop nutritional value. However, wild pollinator populations worldwide have been experiencing alarming declines. This study investigates the contribution of wild pollinators to nutrition and farmers income in Canada, while examining the spatial distribution of these services. Using publicly available data on crop types, yields, nutrient content, and farm gate values, alongside information on natural habitats, we estimated the benefits of wild pollinators across national agricultural landscapes. Our findings reveal that these pollinators sustain approximately 24.4 million equivalent people each year in terms of nutrition and generate an annual income of nearly CAD$2.8 billion for farmers. However, significant benefit gaps exist due to the lack of nearby pollinator habitats and insufficient pollination of dependent crops on a national scale. Addressing these gaps could provide an additional nutrition supply for nearly 30 million equivalent people and increase farmer income by CAD$3 billion. We discuss how and where efforts focused on preserving and enhancing wild pollinator habitats, promoting sustainable farming practices, and raising awareness among stakeholders are crucial for the long-term viability of wild pollinator populations and the sustainability of agricultural systems. This research underscores the urgent need for a national strategy aimed at safeguarding wild pollinators. Implementing such a strategy would not only contribute to strengthening local economies in the regions highlighted in our work but also ensure the production of nutritionally essential food.",

    "abstract": "Widely distributed plants of western North America experience divergent selection across environmental gradients, have complex histories shaped by biogeographic barriers and distributional shifts, and often illustrate continuums of reproductive isolation. Rubber rabbitbrush (Ericameria nauseosa) is a foundational shrub species that occurs across diverse environments of western North America. Its remarkable phenotypic diversity is currently ascribed to two subspecies - E. n. nauseosa and E. n. consimilis - and 22 named varieties. We analyzed how genetic variation is partitioned across subspecies, varieties, and environment using high throughput sequencing of reduced representation libraries. We found clear evidence for divergence between the two subspecies, despite largely sympatric distributions. Numerous locations exhibiting admixed ancestry were not geographically localized but were widely distributed across a mosaic hybrid zone. The occurrence of hybrid and subspecific ancestries was strongly predicted by environmental variables as well as the proximity to major ecotones between ecoregions. Although this repeatability illustrates the importance of environmental factors in shaping reproductive isolation, variability in the outcomes of hybridization also indicated these factors likely differ across ecological contexts. There was mixed evidence for the evolutionary cohesiveness of varieties, but several genetically distinct and narrow endemic varieties exhibited admixed subspecific ancestries, hinting at the possibility for transgressive hybridization to contribute to phenotypic novelty and the colonization of new environments in E. nauseosa.",

    "abstract": "Sex-specific regulation of gene expression is the most plausible way for generating sexually differentiated phenotypes from an essentially shared genome. However, since genetic material is shared, sex-specific selection in one sex can have an indirect response in the other sex. From a gene expression perspective, this tethered response can move one sex away from their wildtype expression state and impact potentially many gene regulatory networks. Here, using experimental evolution in the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we explore the coupling of direct sexual selection on males with the transcriptomic response in females over microevolutionary timescales to uncover the extent to which post-insemination reproductive traits share a genetic basis between the sexes. We find that differential gene expression is driven by female ancestral or evolved generation alone and that male generation has no impact on changes in gene expression. Almost all differentially expressed genes were downregulated in evolved females. Moreover, 80% of these gene were located on the X chromosome and have wildtype female-biased expression profiles. Changes in gene expression profiles were likely driven through trans-acting pathways that are shared between the sexes. We found no evidence that the core dosage compensation machinery was impacted by experimental evolution. Together these data suggest masculinization of the female transcriptome driven by direct selection on male sperm competitive ability. Our results indicate that on short evolutionary timescales sexual selection can generate sexual conflict in expression space.\n\nLAY SUMMARYSexual selection drives the evolution of some of the most dramatic phenotypic differences between the sexes. Such sexual dimorphism is so common across multicellular organisms that we often overlook how remarkable it is for shared genetic material to create numerous and complex sex differences. At an evolutionary level, sexual dimorphism furthers the opportunity for sex-specific selection to optimize the fitness of a given sex. As a consequence, sex-specific selection, such as sexual selection, can have an indirect evolutionary response in the other sex due to genetic associations created by the sexes sharing the same genome. This correlated evolutionary response can create sexual conflict by shifting a sex away from their fitness optimum. At the functional level, sexual dimorphism is generated is through sex-specific regulation of gene expression. Bridging the evolutionary response to sexual selection with the evolution of sex-specific gene regulation during post-mating interactions has proved challenging. We previously used experimental evolution to increase male fertility by directly selecting for increased sperm competitive ability. In this study, we examined the effect of this direct selection on males on gene expression patterns in females. Differential gene expression was determined by whether a female was ancestral or evolved generation, indicating that gene expression changes were an evolved response due to indirect selection on females. Significantly differentially expressed genes were downregulated in evolved females. These genes tended to be female-biased in wildtype individuals and located on the X chromosome. The downregulation of X-linked genes suggests expression levels in females equal to or lower than that in males. Together these results indicate a less female-like transcriptome after experimental evolution. This supports a sexual conflict scenario by which direct sexual selection on males indirectly masculinizes the female transcriptome over short evolutionary timescales.",

    "abstract": "A hallmark of -synucleinopathies including Parkinsons disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy, is the misfolding and aggregation of -synuclein in tissues and biological fluids. Real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) is a protein amplification assay providing ultrasensitive detection of disease-associated misfolded proteins yet is currently limited to invasive sample types such as cerebrospinal fluid for clinical use. More accessible sample types, especially blood, contain inhibitors that interfere with the RT-QuIC assay. Here, we show that Nanoparticle-enhanced Quaking-induced Conversion (Nano-QuIC) can greatly accelerate the detection and improves sensitivity of detection of misfolded alpha-synuclein spiked into extremely complex samples such as human plasma and whole lysed bovine blood compared to RT-QuIC. In spiked human plasma samples, Nano-QuIC showed 100-fold sensitivity improvement while doubling the speed of the reaction. In lysed whole bovine blood, Nano-QuIC detected concentrations of misfolded -synuclein down to 90 pg/ml while RT-QuIC failed to have any detection due to the presence of strong inhibitors. Crucially, no false positives were observed in human plasma or lysed whole blood with 50 nm silica nanoparticles. This sets the groundwork for noninvasive diagnostic use of Nano-QuIC toward enabling early disease detection and management through blood-based testing.\n\nTOC graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=89 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/552630v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4e1c62org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@29788dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a9731dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c4950e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Several popular methods exist to predict function from multiple protein-protein association networks. For example, both the Mashup algorithm, introduced by Cho, Peng and Berger, and deepNF, introduced by Gligorijevi[c], Barotand, and Bonneau, analyze the diffusion in each network first, to characterize the topological context of each node. In Mashup the high-dimensional topological patterns in individual networks are canonically represented using low-dimensional vectors, one per gene or protein, to yield the multi-network embedding. In deepNF, a multimodal autoencoder is trained to extract common network features across networks that yield a low-dimensional embedding. Neither embedding takes into account known functional labels; rather, these are then used by the machine learning methods applied after embedding. We introduce MELISSA (MultiNetwork Embedding with Label Integrated Semi-Supervised Augmentation) which incorporates functional labels in the embedding stage. The function labels induce sets of \"must link\" and \"cannot link\" constraints which guide a further semi-supervised dimension reduction to yield an embedding that captures both the network topology and the information contained in the annotations. We find that the MELISSA embedding improves on the Mashup embedding and outperforms the deepNF embedding in creating more functionally enriched neighborhoods for predicting GO labels for multiplex association networks in both yeast and humans.\n\nAvailabilityMELISSA is available at https://github.com/XiaozheHu/melissa\n\nACM Reference FormatKaiyi Wu, Di Zhou, Donna Slonim, Xiaozhe Hu, and Lenore Cowen. 2023.

The YiNet knowledge base involves 43 VIDs, thereby systematically integrating the knowledge regarding viruses, host symptoms and TCM and Western medicine (commonly used chemical drugs, 6,899 herbs and 2,481 formulas). The YiNet database module includes multiple databases, comprising 57,340 genome sequences of 45,791 viral strains and 5,726 multi-omics datasets such as RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq from different tissues and cell models. It also integrates 1,105 real-world TCM clinical cases. We adopted visual analysis tool to investigate pathogen-host-herb relationships. To explore pharmacological mechanisms for the core herbs, we added formula data mining and network pharmacology analysis pipelines and visualisation tools.

    "abstract": "Amino acid substitutions (AAS) change a protein from its genome-expected sequence. Accumulation of substitutions in proteins underlie numerous diseases and antibiotic mechanisms. Accurate global detection of substitutions and their frequencies would help characterize these mechanisms. Measurement of AAS using shotgun proteomics is attractive due to its high sensitivity and untargeted acquisition. However, identifying substituted peptide-spectra requires search strategies that extrapolate beyond the genome, which can introduce bias. To characterize this bias, we constructed a \"ground-truth\" approach using the similarities between the Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium proteomes to effectively model the complexity of distinguishing substitutions from genomic peptides. Shotgun proteomics on combined whole cell lysates from both organisms generated a library representing nearly 100,000 peptide-spectra and 4,161 distinct peptide sequences corresponding to genome-level single AAS with defined stoichiometry. We tested the ability to identify S. typhimurium peptide-spectra using only the E. coli genome in substitution-tolerant database searching. Overall, 64.1% of library peptides were correctly identified. We observed a wide range of identification efficiencies based on the specific AAS, but no inherent bias from stoichiometry of the substitution. Short peptides and substitutions near peptide termini, which require specific diagnostic ions for unambiguous identification, are matched with below-average frequency. We also identified \"scissor substitutions\" that gain or lose protease cleavage sites. Although scissor substitutions are chemically distinct from the genomic peptide, they had poor identification efficiency. This ground-truth AAS library identifies multiple sources of bias in AAS peptide-spectra identification and sets expectations for the application of shotgun proteomics to testing AAS hypotheses.\n\nSignificance statementHigh-fidelity decoding of the genome is essential for life. Mistranslation leads to amino acid substitutions, which can disrupt protein folding and function, and impact cell fitness. Detection of mistranslated protein products necessitates robust and non-biased approaches. Proteomics is a promising solution, but identifying non-genomic peptide-spectra is a severe bioinformatics challenge. We created a ground-truth library of substituted amino acid peptides by mixing two closely related bacteria in a single sample. We quantitatively defined the degree to which informatics could correctly distinguish substituted peptides when single-organism databases are present. This approach defines intrinsic and informatics limits in substitution detection in shotgun proteomics and identifies previously overlooked challenges with identifying \"scissor substitutions\".",

    "abstract": "Lipids, and cationic lipids in particular, are of interest as delivery vectors for hydrophobic drugs such as the cancer therapeutic paclitaxel, and the structures of lipid assemblies affect their efficacy. We investigated the effect of incorporating the multivalent cationic lipid MVL5 (+5e) and poly(ethylene glycol)-lipids (PEG-lipids), alone and in combination, on the structure of fluid-phase lipid assemblies of the charge-neutral lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-phosphocholine (DOPC). This allowed us to elucidate lipid-liposome structure correlations in sonicated formulations with high charge density, which are not accessible with univalent lipids such as the well-studied DOTAP (+1e). Cryogenic TEM allowed us to determine the structure of the lipid assemblies, revealing diverse combinations of vesicles and disc-shaped, worm-like, and spherical micelles. Remarkably, MVL5 forms an essentially pure phase of disc micelles at 50 mol% MVL5. At higher (75 mol%) content of MVL5, short and intermediate-length worm-like micellar rods were observed and, in ternary mixtures with PEG-lipid, longer and highly flexible worm-like micelles formed. Independent of their length, the worm-like micelles coexisted with spherical micelles. In stark contrast, DOTAP forms mixtures of vesicles, disc micelles and spherical micelles at all studied compositions, even when combined with PEG-lipids. The observed similarities and differences in the effects of charge (multivalent versus univalent) and high curvature (multivalent charge versus PEG-lipid) on assembly structure provide insights into parameters that control the size of fluid lipid nanodiscs, relevant for future applications.",

We purposely search for molecules that are critical for multiple tumor-promoting cell types and identified nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (NR4A1) as one such molecule. NR4A1 has been shown to promote the aggressiveness of cancer cells and maintain the immune suppressive TME. Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we establish NR4A1 as a valid therapeutic target for cancer therapy. Importantly, we have developed the first-of-its kind proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC, named NR-V04) against NR4A1. NR-V04 effectively degrades NR4A1 within hours of treatment in vitro and sustains for at least 4 days in vivo, exhibiting long-lasting NR4A1-degradation in tumors and an excellent safety profile. NR-V04 leads to robust tumor inhibition and sometimes eradication of established melanoma tumors. At the mechanistic level, we have identified an unexpected novel mechanism via significant induction of tumor-infiltrating (TI) B cells as well as an inhibition of monocytic myeloid derived suppressor cells (m-MDSC), two clinically relevant immune cell populations in human melanomas. Overall, NR-V04-mediated NR4A1 degradation holds promise for enhancing anti- cancer immune responses and offers a new avenue for treating various types of cancer.",

The asymptomatic nature of the disease contributes to late-stage diagnoses and poor survival.

Using droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing we profiled 50,236 transcriptomes from paired tumor and healthy adjacent kidney tissues. Our analysis revealed significant heterogeneity and inter-patient variability of the tumor microenvironment. Notably, we discovered a previously uncharacterized vasculature subpopulation associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The cell-cell communication analysis revealed multiple modes of immunosuppressive interactions within the tumor microenvironment, including clinically relevant interactions between tumor vasculature and stromal cells with immune cells. The upregulation of the genes involved in these interactions was associated with worse survival in the TCGA KIRC cohort. Our findings demonstrate the role of tumor vasculature and stromal cell populations in shaping the ccRCC microenvironment and uncover a subpopulation of cells within the tumor vasculature that is associated with an invasive phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer and constitutes about 14.7% of total cancer cases. PCa is highly prevalent and more aggressive in African American (AA) men when compared to European-American (EA) men. PCa tends to be a highly heterogeneous malignancy with a complex biology that is not fully understood. We use metabolomics as a tool to understand the mechanisms behind PCa progression and disparities in its clinical outcome. A key enzyme in the purine metabolic pathway, Adenosine deaminase (ADA) was found upregulated in PCa. ADA was also associated with higher-grade PCa and poor disease-free survival. The inosine-to-adenosine ratio which is a surrogate for ADA activity was high in the urine of PCa patients and higher in AA PCa compared to EA PCa. To understand the significance of high ADA in PCa, we established ADA overexpression models and performed various in vitro and in vivo studies. Our studies have revealed that an acute increase in the expression of ADA during later stages of tumor development enhances in vivo growth in multiple pre-clinical models. Further analysis reveals that this tumor growth could be driven by the activation of mTOR signaling. Chronic ADA overexpression shows alterations in the cells adhesion machinery and a decrease in the adhesion potential of the cells to the extracellular matrix in vitro. Loss of cell-matrix interaction is critical for metastatic dissemination, suggestive of ADAs role in promoting metastasis. This is consistent with the association of higher ADA expression with higher-grade tumors and poor patient survival. Overall, our findings suggest that increased ADA expression may promote PCa progression, specifically tumor growth and metastatic dissemination.",

    "abstract": "KRAS hotspot mutations are difficult to target, highlighting the need of developing new specific target drugs for cancers driven by these mutations, like colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we discover a new ruthenium compound, PMC79, that inhibits specifically mutated KRAS and the downstream signaling ERK and AKT proteins both \"in vitro\" and \"in vivo\". We demonstrated that PMC79 inhibits KRAS mutated kinase activity and is selective for KRAS mutations not affecting the KRAS wild-type protein. KRAS inhibition is not dependent on actin polymerization or on proteasome. Molecular docking analysis suggests that this effect might result from protein dynamics associated with the mutations. We demonstrated that low doses of PMC79 potentiate 5-fluorouracil anticancer effect. \"In vivo\" PMC79 \"proof of concept\" showed that it reduces tumor growth in the CAM-xenograft model and induces necrosis of the tumor in the xenograft mice model. PMC79 is a promising new \"magic bullet\" for CRCs harboring mutated KRAS.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMSBiliary atresia is a fibrosing cholangiopathy affecting neonates that is thought to be caused by a prenatal environmental insult to the bile duct. Biliatresone, a plant toxin with an -methylene ketone group, was previously implicated in toxin-induced biliary atresia in Australian livestock, but is found in a limited location and is highly unlikely to be a significant human toxin. We hypothesized that other molecules with -methylene ketone groups, some with the potential for significant human exposure, might also be biliary toxins.\n\nAPPROACH AND RESULTSWe focused on the family of microcystins, cyclic peptide toxins from blue-green algae that have an -methylene ketone group and are found worldwide, particularly during harmful algal blooms. We found that microcystin-RR, but not 6 other microcystins, caused damage to cell spheroids made using cholangiocytes isolated from 2-3-day-old mice, but not from adult mice. We also found that microcystin- RR caused occlusion of extrahepatic bile duct explants from 2-day-old mice, but not 18-day-old mice. Microcystin-RR caused elevated reactive oxygen species in neonatal cholangiocytes, and treatment with N-acetyl cysteine partially prevented microcystin-RR- induced lumen closure, suggesting a role for redox homeostasis in its mechanism of action.\n\nCONCLUSIONSThis study highlights the potential for environmental toxins to cause neonatal biliary disease and identifies microcystin-RR acting via increased redox stress as a possible neonatal bile duct toxin.",

    "abstract": "Recordings of electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms and their analyses have been instrumental in basic Neuroscience, clinical diagnostics, and the field of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). While in the past such measurements have been conducted mostly in laboratory settings, recent advancements in dry electrode technology pave way to a broader range of consumer and medical application because of their greater convenience compared to gel-based electrodes. Here we conducted resting-state EEG recordings in eleven healthy participants using two dry-electrode devices, the Neiry Headband and the Muse Headband, and a standard gel electrode-based system, the NVX. We examined signal quality for various spatial and spectral ranges which are essential for cognitive monitoring and consumer applications. Distinctive characteristics of signal quality were found, with the Neiry Headband showing sensitivity in low-frequency ranges and successfully replicating the modulations of delta, theta and alpha power corresponding to the eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions, and the NVX system excelling in capturing high-frequency oscillations. The Muse Headband had several limitations in signal quality. We suggest that while dry-electrode technology appears to be appropriate for the EEG rhythm-based applications, the potential benefits of these technologies in terms of ease of use and accessibility should be carefully weighted against the capacity of each concrete system.",

    "abstract": "Menopause is a major endocrinological shift that leads to an increased vulnerability to the risk factors for cognitive impairment and dementia. This is thought to be due to the loss of circulating estrogens, which exert many potent neuroprotective effects in the brain. Systemic replacement of estrogen post-menopause has many limitations, including increased risk for estrogen-sensitive cancers. A more promising therapeutic approach therefore might be to deliver estrogen only to the brain thus limiting adverse peripheral side effects. We examined whether we could enhance cognitive performance by delivering estrogen exclusively to the brain in post-menopausal mice. We modeled surgical menopause via bilateral ovariectomy (OVX). We treated mice with the pro-drug 10{beta},17{beta}-dihydroxyestra-1,4-dien-3-one (DHED), which can be administered systemically but is converted to 17{beta}-estradiol only in the brain. Young (2.5-month) and middle-aged (11-month-old) female C57BL/6J mice received ovariectomy and a subcutaneous implant containing vehicle (cholesterol) or DHED. At 3.5 months old (young group) and 14.5 months old (middle-aged group), mice underwent behavior testing to assess memory. DHED did not significantly alter metabolic status in middle-aged, post-menopausal mice. In both young and middle-aged mice, the brain-specific estrogen DHED improved spatial memory. Additional testing in middle-aged mice also showed that DHED improved working and recognition memory. These promising results lay the foundation for future studies aimed at determining if this intervention is as efficacious in models of dementia that have comorbid risk factors.",

    "abstract": "Recovery from lung injury during the neonatal period requires the orchestration of many biological pathways. The modulation of such pathways can drive the developing lung towards proper repair or persistent maldevelopment that can lead to a disease phenotype. Sex as a biological variable can regulate these pathways differently in the male and female lung exposed to neonatal hyperoxia. In this study, we assessed the contribution of cellular diversity in the male and female neonatal lung following injury. Our objective was to investigate sex and cell-type specific transcriptional changes that drive repair or persistent injury in the neonatal lung and delineate the alterations in the immune-endothelial cell communication networks using single cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNAseq) in a murine model of hyperoxic injury. We generated transcriptional profiles of >55,000 cells isolated from the lungs of postnatal day 1 (PND 1) and postnatal day 21 (PND 21) neonatal male and female C57BL/6 mice exposed to 95% FiO2 between PND 1-5 (saccular stage of lung development). We show the presence of sex-based differences in the transcriptional states of lung endothelial and immune cells at PND 1 and PND 21. Furthermore, we demonstrate that biological sex significantly influences the response to injury, with a greater number of differentially expressed genes showing sex-specific patterns than those shared between male and female lungs. Pseudotime trajectory analysis highlighted genes needed for lung development that were altered by hyperoxia. Finally, we show intercellular communication between endothelial and immune cells at saccular and alveolar stages of lung development with sex-based biases in the crosstalk and identify novel ligand-receptor pairs. Our findings provide valuable insights into the cell diversity, transcriptional state, developmental trajectory, and cell-cell communication underlying neonatal lung injury, with implications for understanding lung development and possible therapeutic interventions while highlighting the crucial role of sex as a biological variable.",

    "abstract": "Microbial biosensors that convert environmental information into real-time visual outputs are limited in their sensing abilities in complex environments, such as soil and wastewater. Alternative reporter outputs are needed that stably record the presence of analytes. Here, we test the performance of recombinase-memory biosensors that sense a sugar (arabinose) and a microbial communication molecule (3-oxo-C12- homoserine lactone) over 8 days ([~]70 generations) following analyte exposure. These biosensors use analyte sensing to trigger the expression of a recombinase which flips a segment of DNA, creating a genetic memory, and initiates fluorescent protein expression. The initial designs failed over time due to unintended DNA flipping in the absence of the analyte and loss of the flipped state after exposure to the analyte. Biosensor performance was improved by decreasing recombinase expression, removing the fluorescent protein output, and using qPCR to read out stored information. Application of memory biosensors in wastewater isolates achieved memory of analyte exposure in an uncharacterized Pseudomonas isolate. By returning these engineered isolates to their native environments, recombinase-memory systems are expected to enable longer duration and in situ investigation of microbial signaling, community shifts, and gene transfer beyond the reach of traditional environmental biosensors.\n\nIMPORTANCELiving microbial sensors can monitor chemicals and biomolecules in the environment in real-time, but they remain limited in their ability to function on the week, month, and year timescales. To determine if environmental microbes can be programmed to record the detection of analytes over longer timescales, we evaluated whether the sensing of a microbial signaling molecule could be recorded through a DNA rearrangement. We show that off-the-shelf DNA memory is suboptimal for long-duration information storage, use iterative design to enable robust functioning over more than a week, and demonstrate DNA memory in an uncharacterized wastewater Pseudomonas isolate. Memory biosensors will be useful for monitoring the role of quorum sensing in wastewater biofilm formation, and variations of this design are expected to enable studies of ecological processes in situ that are currently challenging to monitor using real-time biosensors and analytical instruments.",

    "abstract": "Aphantasia prohibits people from experiencing visual imagery. While most of us can readily recall decade-old personal experiences (autobiographical memories, AM) with vivid mental images, there is a dearth of information about whether the loss of visual imagery in aphantasics affects their AM retrieval. The hippocampus is thought to be a crucial hub in a brain-wide network underlying AM. One important question is whether this network, especially the connectivity of the hippocampus, is altered in aphantasia. In the current study, we tested 14 congenital aphantasics and 16 demographically matched controls in an AM fMRI task to investigate how key brain regions (i.e., vmPFC, hippocampus and visual-perceptual cortices) interact with each other during AM re-experiencing. All participants were interviewed with an Autobiographical Memory Interview to examine their episodic and semantic recall of specific events. Aphantasics reported more difficulties in recalling AM, were less confident about their memories, and described less internal and emotional details than controls. Neurally, aphantasics displayed decreased hippocampal and increased visual-perceptual cortex activation during AM retrieval compared to controls. In addition, aphantasics exhibited stronger connectivity between the hippocampus and the visual cortex during AM and at rest. Connectivity at rest showed opposite relations to visualization self-reports in the two participant groups. Our results indicate that visual mental imagery is essential for detailed-rich, vivid AM and that the functional connection between the hippocampus and visual-perceptual cortex is crucial for this type of retrieval.\n\nSignificance StatementThe current study unravels the role of visual mental imagery in episodic autobiographical memory (AM) retrieval. We show that a lack of mental imagery (= aphantasia) leads to less detailed memories. Neurally, this deficit is associated with hypoactivity in the hippocampus and hyperactivity in the visual-perceptual cortices, as well as hyperconnectivity between both structures. Future studies will show whether mental imagery training leads to changes in these structures and improves recall of AM, which in turn could be used in various disorders involving AM deficits such as dementia.",

    "abstract": "Many empirical studies have focused on highly-ornamented species to identify ecological factors that maintain the ornamentation or favour its exaggeration. By contrast, although reduction or loss of ornamentation appears to be widespread, species with reduced/lost ornamentation and its relationship with ecological factors are rarely focused on. Here, based on data collected over four years, we studied outermost tail feather length, i.e. a well-known sexual ornamentation in this clade, in relation to roosting location in the Pacific swallow Hirundo tahitica during winter. In contrast to congeners, this species has inconspicuous tail ornamentation, i.e. very shallowly forked tails with vestigial streamers, providing a rare opportunity to study the ecological factors driving reduced ornamentation. We found that Pacific swallows mainly roost in old nests under bridges over rivers, which resemble their original roosting sites, but some roost in old nests under the eaves of houses above the ground. Individuals roosting under the eaves of houses had significantly longer outermost (but not central) tail feathers than those roosting under bridges. Individuals roosting under the eaves of houses were heavier and showed lower physiological stress, and thus might better endure the maintenance cost, favouring ornament elaboration. Because we controlled for the effects of sex and age, these factors would not confound the observed pattern. Reduced ornamentation, as found in Pacific swallows roosting under their original roosting sites, could become elaborated in benign environments (i.e., under eaves, here), stressing the importance of balance between the costs and benefits of ornamentation.",
