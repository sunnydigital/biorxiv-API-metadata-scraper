    "abstract": "Efficient gene expression requires RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) to find chromatin targets precisely in space and time. How RNAPII manages this complex diffusive search in 3D nuclear space remains largely unknown. The disordered carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII, which is essential for recruiting transcription-associated proteins, forms phase-separated droplets in vitro, hinting at a potential role in modulating RNAPII dynamics. Here, we use single-molecule tracking and spatiotemporal mapping in living yeast to show that the CTD is responsible for confining RNAPII diffusion within a subnuclear region enriched for active genes, but without apparent phase separation into condensates. Both Mediator and global chromatin organization are required for sustaining RNAPII confinement. Remarkably, truncating the CTD disrupts RNAPII spatial confinement, prolongs target search, diminishes chromatin binding, impairs pre-initiation complex formation, and reduces transcription bursting. This study illuminates the pivotal role of the CTD in driving spatiotemporal confinement of RNAPII for efficient gene expression.",

    "abstract": "YPEL2 is a member of the evolutionarily conserved YPEL family involved in cellular proliferation, mobility, differentiation as well as senescence and death. However, the mechanism by which YPEL2, or YPEL proteins, mediates its effects is yet unknown. Proteins perform their functions in a network of proteins whose identities, amounts, and compositions change spatiotemporally in a lineage-specific manner in response to internal and external stimuli. We here explored interaction partners of YPEL2 by using dynamic TurboID-coupled mass spectrometry analyses to infer a function for the protein. Our results using inducible transgene expressions in COS7 cells indicate that proximity interaction partners of YPEL2 are largely involved in RNA and mRNA metabolic processes, ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis, regulation of gene silencing by miRNA, and cellular responses to stress. We showed that YPEL2 interacts with RNA binding protein ELAVL1 and selective autophagy receptor SQSTM1. We also found that YPEL2 participates in events associated with the formation/disassembly of stress granules in response to sodium arsenite an oxidative stress inducer. Establishing a point of departure in the delineation of structural/functional features of YPEL2, our results suggest that YPEL2 may be involved in stress surveillance mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a highly contagious, fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by infectious prions (PrPCWD) affecting wild and captive cervids. Although experimental feeding studies have demonstrated prions in feces of crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos), coyotes (Canis latrans), and cougars (Puma concolor), the role of scavengers and predators in CWD epidemiology remains poorly understood. Here we applied the real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assay to detect PrPCWD in feces from cervid consumers, to advance surveillance approaches, which could be used to improve disease research and adaptive management of CWD. We assessed recovery and detection of PrPCWD by experimental spiking of PrPCWD into carnivore feces from 9 species sourced from CWD-free populations or captive facilities. We then applied this technique to detect PrPCWD from feces of predators and scavengers in free-ranging populations. Our results demonstrate that spiked PrPCWD is detectable from feces of free-ranging mammalian and avian carnivores using RT-QuIC. Results show that PrPCWD acquired in natural settings is detectable in feces from free-ranging carnivores, and that PrPCWD rates of detection in carnivore feces reflect relative prevalence estimates observed in the corresponding cervid populations. This study adapts an important diagnostic tool for CWD, allowing investigation of the epidemiology of CWD at the community-level.",

    "abstract": "Natural selection makes evolutionary adaptation possible even if the overwhelming majority of new mutations are deleterious. However, in rapidly evolving populations where numerous linked mutations occur and segregate simultaneously, clonal interference and genetic hitchhiking can limit the efficiency of selection, allowing deleterious mutations to accumulate over time. This can in principle overwhelm the fitness increases provided by beneficial mutations, leading to an overall fitness decline. Here, we analyze the conditions under which evolution will tend to drive populations to higher versus lower fitness. Our analysis focuses on quantifying the boundary between these two regimes, as a function of parameters such as population size, mutation rates, and selection pressures. This boundary represents a state in which adaptation is precisely balanced by Mullers ratchet, and we show that it can be characterized by rapid molecular evolution without any net fitness change. Finally, we consider the implications of global fitness-mediated epistasis, and find that under some circumstances this can drive populations towards the boundary state, which can thus represent a long-term evolutionary attractor.",

However, application of these technologies to marine invertebrate species is often impeded by challenges in extracting and purifying their genomic DNA due to high polysaccharide content and other secondary metabolites. In this study, we help resolve this issue by developing and testing DNA extraction protocols for Kellets whelk (Kelletia kelletii), a subtidal gastropod with ecological and commercial importance, by comparing four DNA extraction methods commonly used in marine invertebrate studies. We identified an optimized protocol that balances efficiency, cost, and DNA extraction quality; the Salting out protocol. We validated the protocol using an independent set of tissue samples, then applied it to extract high-molecular-weight (HMW) DNA from over three thousand Kellets whelk tissue samples. The protocol demonstrated scalability and, with added clean-up, suitability for RAD-seq, GT-seq, as well as whole genome sequencing using both long read (ONT MinION) and short read (Illumina Novaseq) sequencing platforms. Our findings offer a robust and versatile DNA extraction and clean-up protocol for supporting genomic research efforts on non-model marine organisms, to help mediate the under-representation of invertebrates in genomic studies.",

    "abstract": "Carbon nanotube field effect transistor (CNT-FET) setups hold great promise for constructing next generation miniaturised biosensors whereby a biomolecular event gates conductance. The main issue is predicting how proteins, with their innate mosaic and distinctive electrostatic surfaces, interact with and thus modulate conductance of the CNT-FET. To overcome this barrier, we used advanced sampling molecular dynamics combined with non-canonical amino acid chemistry, to model the protein electrostatic potential imparted on SWCNTs. Here, we focused our efforts using {beta}-lactamase binding protein (BLIP2) as the receptor due to its potential as a biosensor for the most common antibiotic degrading enzymes, the {beta}-lactamases (BLs). Modelling was confirmed experimentally by attaching BLIP2 at single designed residues positions directly to SWCNTs using genetically encoded phenyl azide photochemistry. Our devices were able to successfully detect the two different BLs, TEM-1 and KPC-2, with each BL generating distinct conductance profiles due to differences in their unique surface electrostatic profiles presented close to the SWCNT surface. The changes in conductance closely matched the predicted electrostatic profile sampled by the SWCNTs on BL binding. Thus, our modelling approach combined with new and straight-forward residue-specific receptor attachment techniques, provides a general approach for more effective and optimal CNT-FET biosensor construction.",

    "abstract": "Alpha-particle radionuclide-antibody conjugates are being clinically evaluated against solid cancers expressing moderate levels of the targeted markers, with promising results. These findings are attributed to the high killing power of alpha-particles in spite of the expected decrease in antibody tumor uptake, that reduces tumor absorbed doses. However, when tumor absorbed doses are reduced, addressing the heterogeneities in delivery of alpha-particles within solid tumors (i.e. enabling uniform irradiation patterns) becomes critical: to maintain efficacy, the fewer alpha-particles delivered within tumors need to traverse/hit as many different cancer cells as possible. This proof-of-concept study describes an approach to complement the antibody- targeted radiotherapy by using a separate carrier to deliver a fraction of the injected radioactivity to tumor regions geographically different than those affected by the antibody; collectively, the two carriers should distribute the alpha-particle emitters, Actinium-225 in particular, more uniformly within tumors maintaining efficacy.\n\nMethodsWe monitored the extent(s) of tumor growth inhibition, onset delay of spontaneous metastases and/or survival on orthotopic MDA-MB-213 and MDA-MB-436 triple negative breast cancer mouse models and on an ectopic BxPC3 pancreatic cancer mouse model, treated systemically with the two separate carriers. Tumors were chosen to express different (but low) levels of HER1, utilized as a model antibody-targeted marker.\n\nResultsIndependent of tumor origin and/or resistance to chemotherapy, the two separate carriers: (a) improved the  primary tumor growth inhibition, (b) eliminated the formation of spontaneous metastases, and/or (c) prolonged survival, at lower or comparable tumor delivered doses relative to the antibody alone, without noticeable off-target toxicities.\n\nConclusionThis tumor-agnostic strategy is timely and could be used to enhance the efficacy of existing alpha-particle radionuclide-antibody treatments without increasing, possibly even reducing, the total administered radioactivity.",

Niclosamide, an anthelmintic medication, has been considered as a TMEM16A inhibitor for treating asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but was recently found to possess broad-spectrum off-target effects. Here we show that, under physiological conditions, niclosamide acutely potentiates TMEM16A without having any inhibitory effect. Our computational and functional characterizations pinpoint a putative niclosamide binding site on the extracellular side of TMEM16A. Mutations in this site attenuate the potentiation. Moreover, niclosamide potentiates endogenous TMEM16A in vascular smooth muscle cells, triggers intracellular calcium increase, and constricts the murine mesenteric artery. Our findings advise caution when considering niclosamide as a TMEM16A inhibitor to treat diseases such as asthma, COPD, and hypertension. The identification of the putative niclosamide binding site provides insights into the mechanism of TMEM16A pharmacological modulation, shining light on developing specific TMEM16A modulators to treat human diseases.",

However, optimal specimen thickness for cryo-ET on lamellae has not been systematically investigated. Furthermore, the ions used to ablate material can cause damage in the lamellae, thereby reducing STA resolution. Here, we systematically benchmark the resolution depending on lamella thickness and the depth of the particles within the sample. Up to ca. 180 nm, lamella thickness does not negatively impact resolution. This shows that there is no need to generate very thin lamellae and thickness can be chosen such that it captures major cellular features. Furthermore, we show that gallium-ion-induced damage extends to depths of up to 30 nm from either lamella surface.",

Here we consider the decision-making process of underground cicada nymphs experiencing random but spatially-correlated thermal microclimates like those in nature.

    "abstract": "Signal transduction by the ligated B cell antigen receptor (BCR) depends on the pre-organization of its intracellular components, such as the effector proteins SLP65 and CIN85 within phase-separated condensates. These liquid-like condensates are based on the interaction between three Src homology 3 (SH3) domains and corresponding proline-rich recognition motifs (PRM) in CIN85 and SLP65, respectively. However, detailed information on the protein conformation and how it impacts on the capability of SLP65/CIN85 condensates to orchestrate BCR signal transduction is still lacking. This study identifies a hitherto unknown intramolecular SH3:PRM interaction between the C-terminal SH3 domain (SH3C) of CIN85 and an adjacent PRM. We used high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments to study the flexible linker region containing the PRM and determined the extent of the interaction in multidomain constructs of the protein. Moreover, we observed that the phosphorylation of a serine residue located in the immediate vicinity of the PRM regulates this intramolecular interaction. This allows for a dynamic modulation of CIN85s valency towards SLP65, regulating the extent of liquid-liquid phase separation. B cell culture experiments further revealed that the PRM/SH3C interaction is crucial for maintaining the physiological level of SLP65/CIN85 condensate formation, activation-induced membrane recruitment of CIN85, and subsequent mobilization of Ca2+. Our findings therefore suggest that the intramolecular interaction to the adjacent disordered linker is effective in modulating CIN85s valency both in vitro and in vivo. This therefore constitutes a powerful way for the modulation of SLP65/CIN85 condensate formation and subsequent B cell signaling processes within the cell.",

This study proposes a hypothesis that the formation of senile plaques is not limited by polymerization kinetics, but is rather limited by the diffusion-driven supply of A{beta} monomers, along with the rate at which the monomers are produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP). A mathematical model incorporating the nucleation and autocatalytic process (via Finke-Watzky model), as well as A{beta} monomer diffusion, was proposed. The obtained system of partial differential equations was solved numerically, and a simplified version was investigated analytically. The computational results predicted that it takes approximately 7 years for A{beta} aggregates to reach a neurotoxic concentration of 50 M. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was performed to examine how the diffusivity of A{beta} monomers and their production rate impact the concentration of A{beta} aggregates.",

    "abstract": "Isocitrate Dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) is commonly mutated in lower grade diffuse gliomas. The IDH1R132H mutation is an important diagnostic tool for tumor diagnosis and prognosis, however its role in glioma development, and its impact on response to therapy, is not fully understood. We developed a murine model of proneural IDH1R132H mutated glioma that shows elevated production of 2-Hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) and increased tri-methylation of lysine residue K27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3) compared to IDH1 wild-type tumors. We found that using Tazemetostat to inhibit the methyltransferase for H3K27, Enhancer of Zeste 2 (EZH2), reduced H3K27me3 levels and increased acetylation on H3K27. We also found that, although the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) Panobinostat was less cytotoxic in IDH1R132H mutated cells (either isolated from murine glioma or oligodendrocyte progenitor cells infected in vitro with a retrovirus expressing IDH1R132H) compared to IDH1-wildtype cells, combination treatment with Tazemetostat is synergistic in both mutant and wildtype models. These findings indicate a novel therapeutic strategy for IDH1-mutated gliomas that targets the specific epigenetic alteration in these tumors.\n\nMain PointsMurine gliomas initiated by the IDH1R132H mutation (in the presence of additional genetic alterations, such as p53 loss and PDGF overexpression) recapitulate the metabolic and transcriptional features of the proneural subtype, as they are characterized by increased 2HG levels, and are enriched for OPC lineage-restricted genes compared to IDH-wildtype murine gliomas. In murine IDH1-R132H glioma cells, EZH2 inhibition is not cytotoxic as a monotherapy but reduces levels of H3K27me3 and increases levels of H3K27ac. IDH1R132H cells are relatively resistant to Panobinostat cytotoxicity compared to IDH-wildtype cells, but combining treatment with EZH2 inhibition synergistically kills glioma cells and increases H3K27ac.",

    "abstract": "Poly(ADP-ribose)ylation or PARylation by PAR polymerase 1 (PARP1) and dePARylation by poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) are equally important for the dynamic regulation of DNA damage response. PARG, the most active dePARylation enzyme, is recruited to sites of DNA damage via pADPr-dependent and PCNA-dependent mechanisms. Targeting dePARylation is considered an alternative strategy to overcome PARP inhibitor resistance. However, precisely how dePARylation functions in normal unperturbed cells remains elusive. To address this challenge, we conducted multiple CRISPR screens and revealed that dePARylation of S phase pADPr by PARG is essential for cell viability. Loss of dePARylation activity initially induced S phase-specific pADPr signaling, which resulted from unligated Okazaki fragments and eventually led to uncontrolled pADPr accumulation and PARP1/2-dependent cytotoxicity. Moreover, we demonstrated that proteins involved in Okazaki fragment ligation and/or base excision repair regulate pADPr signaling and cell death induced by PARG inhibition. In addition, we determined that PARG expression is critical for cellular sensitivity to PARG inhibition. Additionally, we revealed that PARG is essential for cell survival by suppressing pADPr. Collectively, our data not only identify an essential role for PARG in normal proliferating cells but also provide a potential biomarker for the further development of PARG inhibitors in cancer therapy.\n\nSignificance statementPoly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is a reversible post-translational modification. Although PARG may have a protective effect against excessive PARP1 engagement, detailed knowledge of PARGs mechanism of action remains elusive. Here, we showed that PARG participates in DNA replication, especially in Okazaki fragment maturation. Moreover, PARG level is critically important for cellular sensitivity to PARG inhibition, which is a valuable biomarker for PARGi-based therapy.",

    "abstract": "Monoterpenoid indole alkaloid (MIA) biosynthesis in Catharanthus roseus is a paragon of the spatiotemporal complexity achievable by plant specialized metabolism. Spanning a range of tissues, four cell types, and five cellular organelles, MIA metabolism is intricately regulated and organized. This high degree of metabolic differentiation requires inter-cellular and organellar transport, which remains understudied. Here, we have fully characterized a vacuolar importer of secologanin belonging to the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family, named CrMATE1/SLTr. Phylogenetic analyses of MATEs suggested a role in alkaloid transport for CrMATE1, and in planta silencing in two varieties of C. roseus resulted in a shift in the secoiridoid and MIA profiles. Subcellular localization of CrMATE1 confirmed tonoplast localization. A full panel of in vivo biochemical characterization using the Xenopus laevis oocyte expression system was used to determine substrate range, directionality, and rate. We can confirm that CrMATE1 is a vacuolar importer of secologanin, rapidly transporting 1 mM of secologanin within 25 min. Notably, the absence of CrMATE1 leads to a transport bottleneck, resulting in the conversion of secologanin to its reduced form, secologanol, both in planta and in the X. laevis system. The unique substrate-specific activity of CrMATE1 showcases the utility of transporters as gatekeepers of metabolic flux, mediating the balance between anti-herbivory potency and cell homeostasis in planta. MIA and secoiridoid transporters could also be deployed in heterologous systems to guide biosynthetic pathways and improve titers of valuable and life-saving MIAs.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEWe have fully characterized CrMATE1, a multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family transporter in Catharanthus roseus, as a vacuolar importer of secologanin. The translocation of secologanin into the vacuole is necessary for the first committed step of monoterpenoid indole alkaloid (MIA) biosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "Mobile brain imaging with high-density electroencephalography (EEG) can provide insight into the cortical processes involved in complex human walking tasks. While uneven terrain is common in the natural environment and poses challenges to human balance control, there is limited understanding of the supraspinal processes involved with traversing uneven terrain. The primary objective of this study was to quantify electrocortical activity related to parametric variations in terrain unevenness for neurotypical young adults. We used high-density EEG to measure brain activity when thirty-two young adults walked on a novel custom-made uneven terrain treadmill surface with four levels of difficulty at a walking speed tailored to each participant. We identified multiple brain regions associated with uneven terrain walking. Alpha (8 - 13 Hz) and beta (13 - 30 Hz) spectral power decreased in the sensorimotor and posterior parietal areas with increasing terrain unevenness while theta (4 - 8 Hz) power increased in the mid/posterior cingulate area with terrain unevenness. We also found that within stride spectral power fluctuations increased with terrain unevenness. Our secondary goal was to investigate the effect of parametric changes in walking speed (0.25 m/s, 0.5m/s, 0.75 m/s, 1.0 m/s) to differentiate the effects of walking speed from uneven terrain. Our results revealed that electrocortical activities only changed substantially with speed within the sensorimotor area but not in other brain areas. Together, these results indicate there are distinct cortical processes contributing to the control of walking over uneven terrain versus modulation of walking speed on smooth, flat terrain. Our findings increase our understanding of cortical involvement in an ecologically valid walking task and could serve as a benchmark for identifying deficits in cortical dynamics that occur in people with mobility deficits.",

    "abstract": "Metazoans detect and differentiate between innocuous (non-painful) and/or noxious (harmful) environmental cues using primary sensory neurons, which serve as the first node in a neural network that computes stimulus specific behaviors to either navigate away from injury-causing conditions or to perform protective behaviors that mitigate extensive injury. The ability of an animal to detect and respond to various sensory stimuli depends upon molecular diversity in the primary sensors and the underlying neural circuitry responsible for the relevant behavioral action selection. Recent studies in Drosophila larvae have revealed that somatosensory class III multidendritic (CIII md) neurons function as multimodal sensors regulating distinct behavioral responses to innocuous mechanical and nociceptive thermal stimuli. Recent advances in circuit bases of behavior have identified and functionally validated Drosophila larval somatosensory circuitry involved in innocuous (mechanical) and noxious (heat and mechanical) cues. However, central processing of cold nociceptive cues remained unexplored. We implicate multisensory integrators (Basins), premotor (Down-and-Back) and projection (A09e and TePns) neurons as neural substrates required for cold-evoked behavioral and calcium responses. Neural silencing of cell types downstream of CIII md neurons led to significant reductions in cold-evoked behaviors and neural co-activation of CIII md neurons plus additional cell types facilitated larval contraction (CT) responses. We further demonstrate that optogenetic activation of CIII md neurons evokes calcium increases in these neurons. Collectively, we demonstrate how Drosophila larvae process cold stimuli through functionally diverse somatosensory circuitry responsible for generating stimulus specific behaviors.",

Here, we show that brain responses to emotional movies in healthy females vary as a function of primary (PP) and secondary psychopathy (SP) traits. Healthy female volunteers (n=50) with variable scorings in Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale watched a set of emotional movie clips (n=39) during functional magnetic resonance imaging of brain activity. We found that participants low on primary and secondary psychopathy traits showed higher cortical and subcortical activity when watching emotional movies, what possibly indicates the somatosensory simulation and empathizing with the emotions of movie characters. On the other hand, the individuals with high primary and secondary psychopathy traits presented a lack of vicarious engagement during watching movies and they manifested brainstem-based heightened response towards thread-related stimuli, which could indicate potent autonomic reactivity. Overall, our results indicate that variability in psychopathic traits in the general population is manifested as differential neural responses to emotional signals, and confirm previous findings of there being separate PP and SP personality characteristics due to the dissociable brain activity patterns while viewing emotional movies.",

There is evidence to suggest differences in phenomenal experience can produce observable differences in behavior, however it is not well understood how these differences might influence memory. We used fMRI to scan n=49 participants while they encoded and performed a recognition memory test for faces and words. We calculated a cognitive bias score reflecting individual participants propensity toward either Visual Imagery or Internal Verbalization based on their responses to the Internal Representations Questionnaire (IRQ). We found weak positive correlations between memory performance for faces and a bias toward visual imagery and between memory performance for words and bias toward internal verbalization. There were typical patterns of activation differences between words and faces during both encoding and retrieval. There was no effect of internal representation bias on fMRI activation during encoding. At retrieval, however, a bias toward visualization was positively correlated with memory-related activation for both words and faces in inferior occipital gyri. Further, there was a crossover interaction in a network of brain regions such that visualization bias was associated with greater activation for words and verbalization bias was associated with greater activation for faces, consistent with increased effort for non-preferred stimulus retrieval. These findings suggest that individual differences in cognitive representations affect neural activation across different types of stimuli, potentially affecting memory retrieval performance.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSensorimotor computation is a closed-loop process where bottom-up information collected about the current state of the world is integrated with top-down, internally generated knowledge, task-and goal-related affor-dances to create an action plan. In the rodent whisker system, a canonical model of sensorimotor computation in the context of active sensing, emerging evidence suggests that neuromodulatory neurotransmitters help shape senso-rimotor control of the whisker position, and contribute to context-dependent changes in whisking frequency and amplitude. Given that neuromodulatory neurotransmitters are primarily released from subcortical nuclei whose long-range projections target the rest of the central nervous system, the circuit mapping of top-down neuromodulatory control of sensorimotor nuclei in the rodent brain will help to address the mechanisms of active sensing systematically. Therefore, taking advantage of the Allen Institutes Mouse Connectivity database, we provide an updated, cell-type specific map of the sensorimotor circuits in the mouse brain. The map includes 180 projections (65 of which were not previously reported in the literature) across 18 principal and neuromodulatory neurotransmitter-releasing nuclei of the whisker system. Performing a graph network analysis of this connectome, we identify cell-type specific hubs, sources, and sinks, provide anatomical evidence for monosynaptic inhibitory projections into all stages of the ascending pathway, and show that neuromodulatory projections improve network-wide connectivity. These results argue that beyond the modulatory chemical contributions to information processing and transfer in the whisker system, the circuit connectivity features of the neuromodulatory networks position them as nodes of sensory and motor integration.",

We recently identified epigenetic alterations in two members of this group, LAIR1 and LAIR2, in patients with inflammatory tissue damage and recurrent skin and soft tissue infections.

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), we identified candidate transcriptional regulatory elements of LAIR genes and evaluated their regulatory activity using luciferase reporters.\n\nResultsBoth human and murine macrophages significantly upregulate LAIR1 expression as they differentiate from monocytes to macrophages. In response to interferons, LAIR1 protein levels increase, while LPS causes a relative reduction. Regulatory elements flanking LAIR genes exhibit distinct patterns of enhancer activity with variable responses to immune stimuli. These responses are related to discrete sets of transcription factors in inflammatory pathways that correlate with cell-specific LAIR expression patterns. In addition, we identified LAIR1 and LAIR2 regulatory elements that act as foci of 3D genome interactions with other highly active regulatory elements.\n\nConclusionsOur findings define the complex regulatory landscapes of human and mouse LAIR genes and reveal new insights into the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that control the expression of these important immune modulatory proteins.",

    "abstract": "Retrotransposons have invaded eukaryotic centromeres in cycles of repeat expansion and purging, but the function of centromeric retrotransposons, if any, has remained unclear. In Arabidopsis, centromeric ATHILA retrotransposons give rise to epigenetically activated short interfering RNAs (easiRNAs) in mutants in DECREASE IN DNA METHYLATION1 (DDM1), which promote histone H3 lysine-9 di-methylation (H3K9me2). Here, we show that mutants which lose both DDM1 and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) have pleiotropic developmental defects and mis-segregation of chromosome 5 during mitosis. Fertility defects are epigenetically inherited with the centromeric region of chromosome 5, and can be rescued by directing artificial small RNAs to a single family of ATHILA5 retrotransposons specifically embedded within this centromeric region. easiRNAs and H3K9me2 promote pericentromeric condensation, chromosome cohesion and proper chromosome segregation in mitosis. Insertion of ATHILA silences transcription, while simultaneously making centromere function dependent on retrotransposon small RNAs, promoting the selfish survival and spread of centromeric retrotransposons. Parallels are made with the fission yeast S. pombe, where chromosome segregation depends on RNAi, and with humans, where chromosome segregation depends on both RNAi and HELLSDDM1.",

    "abstract": "ESCRTs (Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport) are a modular set of protein complexes with membrane remodeling activities that include the formation and release of intralumenal vesicles (ILVs) to generate multivesicular endosomes. While most of the 12 ESCRT-III proteins are known to play roles in ILV formation, IST1 has been associated with a wider range of endosomal remodeling events. Here, we extend previous studies of IST1 function in endosomal trafficking and confirm that IST1, along with its binding partner CHMP1B, contributes to scission of early endosomal carriers. Depleting IST1 impaired delivery of transferrin receptor from early/sorting endosomes to the endocytic recycling compartment and instead increased its rapid recycling to the plasma membrane via peripheral endosomes enriched in the clathrin adaptor AP-1. IST1 is also important for export of mannose 6-phosphate receptor from early/sorting endosomes. Examination of IST1 binding partners on endosomes revealed that IST1 interacts with the MIT domain-containing sorting nexin SNX15, a protein previously reported to regulate endosomal recycling. Our kinetic and spatial analyses establish that SNX15 and IST1 occupy a clathrin-containing subdomain on the endosomal perimeter distinct from those previously implicated in cargo retrieval or degradation. Using live-cell microscopy we see that SNX15 and CHMP1B alternately recruit IST1 to this subdomain or the base of endosomal tubules. These findings indicate that IST1 contributes to a subset of recycling pathways from the early/sorting endosome.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=95 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/551359v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (16K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14c2658org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@699063org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@867084org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@44f7b6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Ciliary motility requires the spatiotemporal coordination of multiple dynein motors by regulatory complexes located within the 96 nm axoneme repeat. Many organisms can alter ciliary waveforms in response to internal or external stimuli, but little is known about the specific polypeptides and structural organization of complexes that regulate waveforms. In Chlamydomonas, several mutations convert the ciliary waveform from an asymmetric, ciliary-type stroke to a symmetric, flagellar-type stroke. Some of these mutations alter subunits located at the inner junction of the doublet microtubule and others alter interactions between the dynein arms and the radial spokes. These and other axonemal substructures are interconnected by a network of poorly characterized proteins. Here we re-analyze several motility mutants (mbo, fap57, pf12/pacrg) to identify new components in this network. The mbo (move backwards only) mutants are unable to swim forwards with an asymmetric waveform. Proteomics identified more than 19 polypeptides that are missing or reduced in mbo mutants, including one inner dynein arm, IDA b. Several MBO2-associated proteins are also altered in fap57 and pf12/parcg mutants, suggesting overlapping networks. Two subunits are highly conserved, coiled coil proteins found in other species with motile cilia and others contain potential signaling domains. Cryo-electron tomography and epitope tagging revealed that the MBO2 complex is found on specific doublet microtubules and forms a large, L-shaped structure that contacts the base of IDA b that interconnects multiple dynein regulatory complexes and varies in a doublet microtubule specific fashion.",

    "abstract": "Division of apicomplexan parasites differs drastically from the division of their host cells. A fraction of apicomplexans divides in the traditional binary mode, such as Toxoplasma gondii in asexual stages, whereas the vast majority instead divide in a multinuclear fashion. Such variety of replication modes and a dearth of conserved conventional regulators have hindered the progress of apicomplexan cell cycle studies. We previously identified five Cdk-related kinases (Crk) involved in endodyogenic division of T. gondii tachyzoites. The current study investigates the roles of a novel essential cell cycle kinase TgCrk4. We identified this kinase cyclin partner and demonstrated that TgCrk4 regulates processes carried out during conventional G2 phase, such as repression of chromosome re-replication and centrosome re-duplication. Profiles of the G2 phase confirmed a cell cycle stop prior to the TgCrk6-regulated spindle assembly checkpoint. Accumulation of TgCyc4 in the nucleus and on the centrosomes, supported the role of TgCrk4-TgCyc4 complex as a coordinator of chromosome and centrosome cycles in T. gondii. Furthermore, we identified a previously missing DNA replication licensing factor TgCdt1 that was a dominant interactor of the TgCrk4-TgCyc4 complex. T. gondii Cdt1 is highly divergent, but preserved critical signature domains and appears to play a minimal or no role in licensing DNA replication in G1 phase. Functional analyses indicated the primary role of TgCdt1 is in controlling chromosome re-replication and centrosome re-duplication. Global phosphoproteome analyses identified immediate TgCrk4 substrates, such as DNA replication licensing factor TgORC4, {gamma}-tubulin nucleation factor TgGCP2, and the catalytic subunit of cell cycle phosphatase TgPP2ACA. Importantly, our phylogenetic and structural analyses established that the functional TgCrk4-TgCyc4 complex was encoded in the limited group of apicomplexans that employ binary cell division. Together with the minimal representation of binary division in Apicomplexa phylum, our findings support the novel view of apicomplexans acquiring binary division to repress ancestral multinuclear mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "An 18-base myogenetic oligodeoxynucleotide (myoDN), iSN04, acts an anti-nucleolin aptamer and induces myogenic differentiation of skeletal muscle myoblasts. This study investigated the effect of iSN04 on murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). In the undifferentiated state, iSN04 inhibited the proliferation of ESCs and iPSCs but did not affect the expression of pluripotent markers. In the differentiating condition, iSN04 treatment of ESCs/iPSCs from day 5 onward dramatically induced the differentiation into Nkx2-5+ beating cardiomyocytes with upregulation of Gata4, Isl1, and Nkx2-5, whereas iSN04 treatment from earlier stages completely inhibited cardiomyogenesis. RNA sequencing revealed that iSN04 treatment from day 5 onward contributes to the generation of cardiac progenitors by modulating the Wnt signaling pathway. Immunostaining showed that iSN04 suppressed the cytoplasmic translocation of nucleolin and restricted it to the nucleoli. These results demonstrate that nucleolin inhibition by iSN04 facilitates the terminal differentiation of cardiac mesoderm into cardiomyocytes, but interferes with the differentiation of early mesoderm into the cardiac lineage. This is the first report on the generation of cardiomyocytes from pluripotent stem cells using a DNA aptamer. Since iSN04 did not induce hypertrophic responses in primary-cultured cardiomyocytes, iSN04 would be useful and safe for the regenerative therapy of heart failure using stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.",

    "abstract": "Species are often expected to shift their distributions poleward to evade warming climates. However, from 18 years of fixed transect monitoring data on 88 species of butterfly in the midwestern United States, we show that butterflies are shifting their centroids in all directions, except towards regions that are becoming warmer. Butterflies shifted their centroids at a mean rate of 4.87 km yr-1. The rate of centroid shift was significantly associated with local climate change velocity (temperature and precipitation), but not with mean climate change velocity throughout the species ranges. Surprisingly, the centroid shift was also unrelated to species traits expected to mediate the shift response including thermal niche breadth (range of climates butterflies experience throughout their distribution) and wingspan (often used as metric for dispersal capability). Contrasting with a number of previous studies, we observed relatively high phylogenetic signal in the rate and direction species shifted their centroids, suggesting that evolutionary history helps to explain multidirectional range shift responses and that some groups of species will be better able to shift their ranges than others. This research shows important signatures of multidirectional range shifts (latitudinal and longitudinal) and uniquely shows that local climate change velocities are more important in driving range shifts than the mean climate change velocity throughout a species entire range.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural pesticides such as commonly used neonicotinoids are major drivers of the global entomofauna declines. Furthermore, synergistic interactions between pesticides and other stressors substantially amplify their environmental effects and could therefore have important implications for policy decisions that aim to improve the health of insects. Due to increasing restrictions for neonicotinoid use in the EU and rising pest resistance, alternatives were introduced, such as flupyradifurone, a novel systemic butenolide insecticide that was initially promoted as safe for non-target insects. However, this is increasingly questioned by the accumulation of evidence for harmful effects on pollinators. Furthermore, studies investing effects in other non-target arthropods are lacking. We therefore investigated how chronic exposure to flupyradifurone affects survival of black garden ants Lasius niger. Furthermore, we studied potential interactive effects of field realistic flupyradifurone doses with exposure to the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium brunneum. We found that concentrations exceeding 50 ppm result in increased worker mortality, and that field realistic contamination did not reduce food intake. At low concentrations, flupyradifurone exposure alone did not affect survival, but chronic flupyradifurone exposure at sublethal doses increased pathogen susceptibility in ants, indicating a synergistic effect of the two stressors. This first report of synergistic effects between flupyradifurone and pathogens raises further concerns about the long-term impacts of novel pesticides on the health of beneficial insects.",

    "abstract": "Extinct Cape lions (Panthera leo melanochaitus) formerly ranged throughout the grassland plains of the \"Cape Flats\" in what is today known as the Western Cape Province, South Africa. Cape lions were likely eradicated because of overhunting and habitat loss after European colonization. European naturalists originally described Cape lions as \"Black-maned lions\" and claimed that they were phenotypically distinct. However, other depictions and historical descriptions of lions from the Cape report mixed or light coloration and without black or extensively developed manes. These findings suggest that, rather than forming a distinct population, Cape lions may have had phenotypic and genotypic variation similar to other African lions. Here we investigate extinct Cape lion genome characteristics, population dynamics and genetic distinctiveness prior to their extinction. We generated genomic data from two historic Cape lions to compare to 118 existing high-coverage mitogenomes, and low-coverage nuclear genomes of 53 lions from 13 African countries. We show that, before their eradication, lions from the Cape Flats had diverse mitogenomes and nuclear genomes that clustered with lions from both southern and eastern Africa. Cape lions had high genome-wide heterozygosity and low inbreeding coefficients, indicating that populations in the Cape Flats went extinct so rapidly that genomic effects associated with long-term small population size and isolation were not detectable. Our findings do not support the characterization of Cape lions as phylogeographically distinct, as originally put forth by some European naturalists, but rather highlights how alternative knowledge-systems, e.g., Indigenous perspectives, could potentially further inform interpretations of species life histories.",

    "abstract": "Odonata (damselflies and dragonflies) are a largely diurnal, colourful, and strongly visually guided group of insects with visual systems influenced by many opsin genes that form the primary light-sensitive eye photopigments. Heritable (genetic) female-limited colour polymorphisms are also common in Odonata, with one female morph typically exhibiting male-like (androchrome) colouration and one or two morphs exhibiting female-specific colouration (gynochromes). In the Common Bluetail Damselfly (Ischnura elegans), androchrome females express blue body colouration similar to that of mature males while gynochrome females express either green or red-brown colouration. This and other colour polymorphisms in damselflies are thought to be maintained by male mating harassment and frequency-dependent sexual conflict, in which males form search images for certain morphs which suffer disproportionally from mating harassment. Here, we investigate the role of opsin sensitivity and expression plasticity in visual mate detection in I. elegans by quantifying relative opsin mRNA expression over adult maturation in populations with different female morph frequencies in southern Sweden. We find evidence for opsin-specific plasticity in relative and proportion opsin expression, suggesting changes in opsin regulation and visual sensitivity over adult maturation. Furthermore, the relative expression of the long-wavelength sensitive opsin LWF2 changed in response to female morph frequencies. The highest relative expression levels were found in populations with either a high or low proportion of androchrome females. In vitro results indicate that long-wavelength sensitive opsins in I. elegans provide a good visual match to the colouration of green gynomorph females and could in principle confer male colour discrimination between female morphs. We discuss these results in relation to frequency dependent selection, male sensory adaptations, plastic search images and mate searching costs. We suggest that opsin gene expression could play an important role in male search image formation of suitable mates.",

    "abstract": "In contrast to most butterflies harboring opaque wing colorations, some species display large transparent patches on their wings. Wing transparency, which entails a dramatic reduction of pigmentation, raises the question of potential costs for vital functions, such as thermoregulation, especially along climatic gradients. The thermal melanism hypothesis posits that darker colorations should be favored in colder environments, which enables them to absorb more radiation and maintain a body temperature compatible with activity. This prediction extends to the near infrared (NIR) range, which represents a large proportion of solar radiation. Here we assess the implications of wing transparency for light absorption and thermal properties in 42 butterfly species from the neotropical tribe Ithomiini that range the extent of transparency, from fully opaque to highly transparent, and we test whether those species conform to the prediction of the thermal melanism hypothesis. We find that transparent wings are less efficient than opaque wings to absorb light across UV, Visible and NIR wavelength ranges, and are also less efficient to collect heat. Moreover, dark coloration occupies a lower proportion of wing area as altitude increases, and ithomiine species harbor more transparency at higher altitudes, where climatic conditions are colder, going strongly against the prediction of the thermal melanism hypothesis. We discuss these surprising results in light of recent studies suggesting that factors other than adaptation to cold, such as predation pressure, physiology or behavior, may have driven the evolution of wing patterns in Ithomiini.\n\nSignificance StatementThe thermal melanism hypothesis predicts that organisms should be darker and absorb solar radiation more efficiently in colder environments. The Neotropical butterflies Ithomiini are unusual in that many species harbor large transparent patches on their wings, raising questions related to their efficacy of solar radiation absorption and heating capacities. We investigate optical and thermal properties of several ithomiine species along a climatic gradient. We find that transparent wings are less efficient at absorbing radiation and collecting heat. Unexpectedly, the proportion of transparent species increases with altitude, challenging the thermal melanism hypothesis and suggesting that factors other than adaptation to cold, such as predation pressure, may have driven the evolution of wing patterns in Ithomiini.",

    "abstract": "The neurotrophic factor, Mesencephalic Astrocyte Derived Neurotrophic Factor (MANF), promotes neuronal health and survival. MANF is conserved in metazoans and necessary for the protection of dopaminergic neurons. The neuroprotective role of MANF involves regulation of the ER unfolded protein response (ER-UPR). Recent work has shown that MANF also functions in many other tissues and affects autophagy genes. Previously, we reported that C. elegans manf-1 mutants show defects including increased ER stress, -Synuclein aggregation, and age-dependent dopaminergic neurodegeneration. In this study, we have further investigated manf-1s function and describe its mechanism of action in regulating stress response, protein aggregation and aging. Our results showed that exposure to ER stress-inducing agents caused manf-1 transcription and protein expression to be upregulated. Consistent with the protective role of manf-1, mutant animals showed greater sensitivity to ER stress and died prematurely. We generated manf-1p::manf-1::mCherry (MANF-1OE) and hsp::manf-1 transgenic strains overexpressing MANF and found that these animals had an extended lifespan, reduced protein aggregation, and increased neuronal health. The in vivo analysis of MANF-1 expression revealed that the protein was secreted and present in many tissues. Subcellular studies showed that MANF-1 was localized to lysosomes. We also observed that MANF-1OE worms had reduced LGG-1 and SQST-1/p62 levels, and increased expression and nuclear localization of the autophagy transcription factor hlh-30/TFEB. Thus, MANF-1 regulates protein homeostasis through increased lysosome activity and autophagic flux. Collectively, our work provides a novel understanding of MANF-1 function in promoting neuronal health, stress response, proteostasis, and lifespan of animals.",

    "abstract": "Domestication of cranberry and blueberry began in the United States in the early 1800s and 1900s, respectively, and in part owing to their flavors and health-promoting benefits are now cultivated and consumed worldwide. The industry continues to face a wide variety of production challenges (e.g. disease pressures) as well as a demand for higher-yielding cultivars with improved fruit quality characteristics. Unfortunately, molecular tools to help guide breeding efforts for these species have been relatively limited compared with those for other high-value crops. Here, we describe the construction and analysis of the first pangenome for both blueberry and cranberry. Our analysis of these pangenomes revealed both crops exhibit great genetic diversity, including the presence-absence variation of 48.4% genes in highbush blueberry and 47.0% genes in cranberry. Auxiliary genes, those not shared by all cultivars, are significantly enriched with molecular functions associated with disease resistance and the biosynthesis of specialized metabolites, including compounds previously associated with improving fruit quality traits. The discovery of thousands of genes, not present in the previous reference genomes for blueberry and cranberry, will serve as the basis of future research and as potential targets for future breeding efforts. The pangenome, as a multiple-sequence alignment, as well as individual annotated genomes, are publicly available for analysis on the Genome Database for Vaccinium - a curated and integrated web-based relational database. Lastly, the core-gene predictions from the pangenomes will serve useful to develop a community genotyping platform to guide future molecular breeding efforts across the family.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive lung disease characterized by excessive scarring of lung tissue. Recent studies have indicated a potential link between IPF and type 2 diabetes (T2D), suggesting that T2D may contribute to the pathogenesis of IPF or vice versa. In this study, we aim to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms and pathways involved in the development of IPF complicated with T2D using microarray data analysis.\n\nMethodsThe datasets for Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) (GSE25724) and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) (GSE110147) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differential expression analysis was conducted using the  limma package in R to identify genes that were significantly differentially expressed between T2D and IPF samples. Functional enrichment analysis of these differentially expressed genes was performed using Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG).\n\nTo explore protein-protein interactions, protein-protein interaction networks were constructed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) database and visualized using Cytoscape. CytoHubba, a plugin in Cytoscape, was utilized to identify hub genes in the network. The identified hub genes were further validated in independent datasets: GSE166467 for T2D and GSE24206 for IPF.\n\nTo assess the predictive value of the hub genes, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated. Additionally, gene set enrichment analysis was performed to uncover potential biological pathways associated with the hub genes. Finally, an analysis of immune infiltration within the hub gene network was conducted.\n\nResultsA total of 255 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found to be commonly dysregulated in both Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). Pathways related to metabolic processes were significantly enriched in the analysis of both T2D and IPF. Through the validation process, RPL30 was identified as a hub gene, exhibiting an area under the curve (AUC) value greater than 0.65 for both T2D and IPF. Additionally, we identified 92 transcription factors (TFs) and 54 microRNAs (miRNAs) that may potentially regulate the expression of RPL30.\n\nConclusionsThis study provides novel insights by highlighting the role of RPL30 in the shared pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis and Type 2 diabetes (T2D). The findings suggest that RPL30 has the potential to serve as a biomarker and therapeutic target for these conditions.",

    "abstract": "High throughput gene expression profiling is a powerful approach to generate hypotheses on the underlying causes of biological function and disease. Yet this approach is limited by its ability to infer underlying biological pathways and burden of testing tens of thousands of individual genes. Machine learning models that incorporate prior biological knowledge are necessary to extract meaningful pathways and generate rational hypothesis from the vast amount of gene expression data generated to date. We adopted an unsupervised machine learning method, Pathway-level information extractor (PLIER), to train the first mouse PLIER model on 190,111 mouse brain RNA-sequencing samples, the greatest amount of training data ever used by PLIER. mousiPLER converted gene expression data into a latent variables that align to known pathway or cell maker gene sets, substantially reducing data dimensionality and improving interpretability. To determine the utility of mousiPLIER, we applied it to a mouse brain aging study of microglia and astrocyte transcriptomic profiling. We found a specific set of latent variables that are significantly associated with aging, including one latent variable (LV41) corresponding to striatal signal. We next performed k-means clustering on the training data to identify studies that respond strongly to LV41, finding that the variable is relevant to striatum and aging across the scientific literature. Finally, we built a web server (http://mousiplier.greenelab.com/) for users to easily explore the learned latent variables. Taken together this study provides proof of concept that mousiPLIER can uncover meaningful biological processes in mouse transcriptomic studies.\n\nSignificance statementAnalysis of RNA-sequencing data commonly generates differential expression of individual genes across conditions. However, genes are regulated in complex networks, not as individual entities. Machine learning models that incorporate prior biological information are a powerful tool to analyze human gene expression. However, such models are lacking for mouse despite the vast number of mouse RNA-seq datasets. We trained a mouse pathway-level information extractor model (mousiPLIER). The model reduced the data dimensionality from over 10,000 genes to 196 latent variables that map to prior pathway and cell marker gene sets. We demonstrated the utility of mousiPLIER by applying it to mouse brain aging data and developed a web server to facilitate the use of the model by the scientific community.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical phenotyping of tumors, either at an individual cell level or tumor cell population level is gaining traction as a diagnostic tool. However, the extent of diagnostic and prognostic information that can be gained through these measurements is still unclear. In this work, we focus on the heterogeneity in mechanical properties of cells obtained from a single source such as a tissue or tumor as a potential novel biomarker. We believe that this heterogeneity is a conventionally overlooked source of information in mechanical phenotyping data. We use mechanics-based in-silico models of cell-cell interactions and cell population dynamics within 3D environments to probe how heterogeneity in cell mechanics drives tissue and tumor dynamics. Our simulations show that the initial heterogeneity in the mechanical properties of individual cells and the arrangement of these heterogenous sub-populations within the environment can dictate overall cell population dynamics and cause a shift towards the growth of malignant cell phenotypes within healthy tissue environments. The overall heterogeneity in the cellular mechanotype and their spatial distributions is quantified by a \"patchiness\" index, which is the ratio of the global to local heterogeneity in cell populations. We observe that there exists a threshold value of the patchiness index beyond which an overall healthy cell population of cells will show a steady shift towards a more malignant phenotype. Based on these results, we propose that the \"patchiness\" of a tumor or tissue sample, can be an early indicator for malignant transformation and cancer occurrence in benign tumors or healthy tissues. Additionally, we suggest that tissue patchiness, measured either by biochemical or biophysical markers, can become an important metric in predicting tissue health and disease likelihood just as landscape patchiness is an important metric in ecology.",

    "abstract": "Could diet and mean plasma glucose concentration (MPGluC) explain the variation in cancer prevalence across species? We collected diet, MPGluC, and neoplasia data for 160 vertebrate species from existing databases. We found that MPGluC negatively correlates with cancer and neoplasia prevalence, mostly of gastrointestinal organs. Trophic level positively correlates with cancer and neoplasia prevalence even after controlling for species MPGluC. Most species with high MPGluC (50/78 species = 64.1%) were birds. Most species in high trophic levels (42/53 species = 79.2%) were reptiles and mammals. Our results may be explained by the evolution of insulin resistance in birds which selected for loss or downregulation of genes related to insulin-mediated glucose import in cells. This led to higher MPGluC, intracellular caloric restriction, production of fewer reactive oxygen species and inflammatory cytokines, and longer telomeres contributing to longer longevity and lower neoplasia prevalence in extant birds relative to other vertebrates.",

    "abstract": "Treatment response variability across patients is a common phenomenon in clinical practice. For many drugs this inter-individual variability does not require much (if any) individualisation of dosing strategies. However, for some drugs, including chemotherapies and some monoclonal antibody treatments, individualisation of dosages are needed to avoid harmful adverse events. Model-informed precision dosing (MIPD) is an emerging approach to guide the individualisation of dosing regimens of otherwise difficult-to-administer drugs. Several MIPD approaches have been suggested to predict dosing strategies, including regression, reinforcement learning (RL) and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PKPD) modelling. A unified framework to study the strengths and limitations of these approaches is missing. We develop a framework to simulate clinical MIPD trials, providing a cost and time efficient way to test different MIPD approaches. Central for our framework is a clinical trial model that emulates the complexities in clinical practice that challenge successful treatment individualisation. We demonstrate this framework using warfarin treatment as a use case and investigate three popular MIPD methods: 1. neural network regression; 2. deep RL; and 3. PKPD modelling. We find that the PKPD model individualises warfarin dosing regimens with the highest success rate and the highest efficiency: 75.1% of the individuals display INRs inside the therapeutic range at the end of the simulated trial; and the median time in the therapeutic range (TTR) is 74 %. In comparison, the regression model and the deep RL model have success rates of 47.9% and 65.8 %, and median TTRs of 45 % and 68 %. We also find that the MIPD models can attain different degrees of individualisation: the Regression model individualises dosing regimens up to variability explained by covariates; the Deep RL model and the PKPD model individualise dosing regimens accounting also for additional variation using monitoring data. However, the Deep RL model focusses on control of the treatment response, while the PKPD model uses the data also to further the individualisation of predictions.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of the mesolimbic reward circuitry is implicated in the pathophysiology of stress-related illnesses such as depression and anxiety. These disorders are more frequently diagnosed in females, and sex differences in the response to stress are likely to be one factor that leads to enhanced vulnerability of females. In this study, we use subchronic variable stress (SCVS), a model in which females are uniquely vulnerable to behavioral disturbances, to investigate sexually divergent mechanisms of regulation of the ventral tegmental area by stress. Using slice electrophysiology, we find that female, but not male mice have a reduction in the ex vivo firing rate of VTA dopaminergic neurons following SCVS. Surprisingly, both male and female animals show an increase in inhibitory tone onto VTA dopaminergic neurons and an increase in the firing rate of VTA GABAergic neurons. In males, however, this is accompanied by a robust increase in excitatory synaptic tone onto VTA dopamine neurons. This supports a model by which SCVS recruits VTA GABA neurons to inhibit dopaminergic neurons in both male and female mice, but males are protected from diminished functioning of the dopaminergic system by a compensatory upregulation of excitatory synapses.",

    "abstract": "Speech is hard to understand when there is background noise. Speech intelligibility and listening effort both affect our ability to understand speech, but the relative contribution of these subjective factors is hard to disentangle. Previous studies suggest that speech intelligibility could be assessed with EEG speech tracking and listening effort via pupil size. However, these measures may be confounded, because poor intelligibility may require a larger effort. To address this we developed a novel word-detection paradigm that allows for a rapid behavioral assessment of speech processing. In this paradigm words appear on the screen during continuous speech similar to closed captioning. In two listening experiments with a total of 51 participants we manipulated intelligibility with changing auditory noise levels and modulated effort by varying monetary reward. Increasing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improved detection performance along with EEG speech tracking, suggesting improved intelligibility. Additionally, we find larger pupil size with increased SNR, suggestive of increased effort. Surprisingly, when we modulated both reward and SNR, we found that reward modulated only pupil size, while SNR modulated only EEG speech tracking. We suggest that this new paradigm can be used to independently and objectively assess speech intelligibility and listening effort.",

Plants provide AM fungi with carbon in exchange for nutrients and water, making this interaction a prime target for crop improvement. However, plant-fungal interactions are restricted to a small subset of root cells, precluding the application of most conventional functional genomic techniques to study the molecular bases of these interactions. Here we used single-nucleus and spatial RNA sequencing to explore both M. truncatula and R. irregularis transcriptomes in AM symbiosis at cellular and spatial resolution. Integrated spatially-registered single-cell maps of interacting cells revealed major infected and uninfected plant root cell types. We observed that cortex cells exhibit distinct transcriptome profiles during different stages of colonization by AM fungi, indicating dynamic interplay between both organisms during establishment of the cellular interface enabling successful symbiosis. Our study provides insight into a symbiotic relationship of major agricultural and environmental importance and demonstrates a paradigm combining single-cell and spatial transcriptomics for the analysis of complex organismal interactions.",

Genotyping analysis showed that abundant variations in promoter of BrrRCO is responsible for leaf lobe variation, and the expression levels and promoter activity were significantly affected by the promoter variations between two parents. BrrRCO was a nucleus-specific protein and possess highest expression level at the bases of each lobe. Ectopic overexpression of BrrRCO in Arabidopsis led to deeply lobed leaves have never been seen in wild type, and leaf lobe development was blocked when BrrRCO expression was down-regulated through virus-induced gene silencing assays. Taken together, our findings revealed that BrrRCO positively regulate leaf lobe formation in Chinese cabbage, and the cis-regulatory element modifications result in functional variation of BrrRCO, providing a novel insight into the leaf shape improvement in Chinese cabbage and other Brassica species.\n\nHighlightBrrRCO is essential for leaf lobe formation by repressing local growth of leaf margin cells in B. rapa, and cis-regulatory modifications cause the different allele effects.",

    "abstract": "The microRNA miR319 and its target JAW-TCP transcription factors regulate leaf morphogenesis in diverse plant species. In young Arabidopsis leaf primordia, JAW-TCPs are detected towards the distal region whereas MIR319C is expressed at the base. Little is known about how this complementary expression pattern of MIR319C and JAW-TCPs is generated. Here, we show that MIR319C is initially expressed uniformly throughout the incipient primordia and is later abruptly down-regulated at the distal region, with concomitant distal appearance of JAW-TCPs, when leaves grow to [~]100 {micro}m long. Loss of JAW-TCPs causes distal extension of MIR319C expression domain, whereas ectopic TCP activity restricts MIR319C more proximally. JAW-TCPs are recruited to and are capable of depositing histone H3K27me3 repressive marks on the MIR319C chromatin. JAW-TCPs fail to repress MIR319C in transgenic seedlings where the TCP-binding cis-elements on MIR319C are mutated, causing miR319 gain-of-function-like phenotype. Based on these results, we propose a model for growth patterning in leaf primordia wherein MIR319C and JAW-TCPs repress each other and divide the uniformly growing primordia into distal differentiation zone and proximal proliferation domain.\n\nSummary statementJAW-TCPs transcriptionally repress the microRNA319 encoding gene MIR319C to generate their mutually exclusive expression pattern and establish growth polarity during early stages of Arabidopsis leaf primordia.",

    "abstract": "mRNA vaccine technologies introduced following the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have highlighted the need to better understand the interaction of adjuvants and the early innate immune response. Interferon type I (IFN-I) is an integral part of this early innate response and can prime several components of the adaptive immune response. Females are widely reported to respond better than males to seasonal tri- and quad-valent influenza vaccines. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are the primary cell type responsible for IFN-I production and female pDCs produce more IFN-I than male pDCs since the upstream receptor TLR7 is encoded by the X-chromosome and is biallelically expressed by up to 30% of female immune cells. Additionally, the TLR7 promoter contains putative androgen response elements and androgens have been reported to suppress pDC IFN-I in-vitro.\n\nUnexpectedly, therefore, we recently observed that male adolescents mount stronger antibody responses to the Pfizer BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine than female adolescents after controlling for natural SARS-CoV-2 infection. We here examined pDC behaviour in this cohort to determine the impact of IFN-I on anti-Spike and anti-receptor-binding domain titres to BNT162b2. Through LASSO modelling we determined that serum free testosterone was associated with reduced pDC IFN-I but, contrary to the well-described immunosuppressive role for androgens, the more potent androgen dihydrotestosterone was associated with increased IgG titres to BNT162b2. Also unexpectedly, we observed that co-vaccination with live-attenuated influenza vaccine boosted the magnitude of IgG responses to BNT162b2. Together these data support a model where systemic IFN-I increased vaccine-mediated immune responses, but for vaccines with intracellular stages, modulation of the local IFN-I response may alter antigen longevity and consequently vaccine-driven immunity.\n\nAuthor SummaryType I interferons (IFN-I) are potent antiviral proteins which play a central role in activating the immune response and driving inflammation. IFN-I is predominantly produced by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and female pDCs produce more IFN-I than male pDCs. Consequently, females typically generate stronger antibody responses to vaccines such as seasonal influenza vaccines. In addition, females typically suffer more serious adverse events from vaccines. However, we recently reported in a study of adolescents that males generate stronger antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 than females. Here we examine the IFN-I response of pDCs in adolescents co-/vaccinated with BNT162b2 and live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). We find that male sex hormones reduce pDC IFN-I but are associated with increased BNT162b2 antibody titres. We also observe that LAIV boosts BNT162b2 antibody titres through possible bystander activation of immune cells. These findings are consistent with a reportedly higher incidence of adverse events among males associated with this vaccine. Together these data suggest that IFN-I production typically enhances vaccine-specific immune responses but for new mRNA vaccines such as BNT162b2, that are modified to reduce innate immunogenicity, localised dampening of the IFN-I response in vaccinated tissue by male sex hormones may further delay the clearance of the vaccine, increasing vaccine antigen exposure and allowing time for a stronger antibody response.",

PlaCCine, a DNA-based vaccine approach described subsequently relies on a synthetic DNA delivery system and is independent of virus or device. The synthetic functionalized polymer combined with DNA demonstrated stability over 12 months at 4C and for one month at 25C. Transfection efficiency compared to naked DNA increased by 5-15-fold in murine skeletal muscle. Studies of DNA vaccines expressing spike proteins from variants D614G (pVAC15), Delta (pVAC16), or a D614G + Delta combination (pVAC17) were conducted. Mice immunized intramuscular injection (IM) with pVAC15, pVAC16 or pVAC17 formulated with functionalized polymer and adjuvant resulted in induction of spike-specific humoral and cellular responses. Antibody responses were observed after one immunization. And endpoint IgG titers increased to greater than 1x 105 two weeks after the second injection. Neutralizing antibodies as determined by a pseudovirus competition assay were observed following vaccination with pVAC15, pVAC16 or pVAC17. Spike specific T cell immune responses were also observed following vaccination and flow cytometry analysis demonstrated the cellular immune responses included both CD4 and CD8 spike specific T cells. The immune responses in vaccinated mice were maintained for up to 14 months after vaccination. In an immunization and challenge study of K18 hACE2 transgenic mice pVAC15, pVAC16 and pVAC17 induced immune responses lead to decreased lung viral loads by greater than 90% along with improved clinical score.

Here, we show that mice immunized intravenously with BCG exhibited reduced weight loss and/or improved viral clearance when challenged with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza. Protection was first evident between 14 - 21 days post vaccination, and lasted for at least 42 days. Remarkably, BCG induced a biphasic innate response in the lung, initially at day 1 and a subsequent prolonged phase starting at [~]15 days post vaccination, and robust antigen-specific Th1 responses. MyD88-dependent TLR signaling was essential for the induction of the innate and Th1 responses, and protection against SARS-CoV-2. Depletion of CD4+ T cells or IFN-{gamma} activity prior to infection obliterated innate activation and protection. Single cell and spatial transcriptomics revealed CD4-dependent expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in myeloid, type II alveolar and lung epithelial cells.

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlthough our understanding of the immunopathology and subsequent risk and severity of COVID-19 disease is evolving, a detailed account of immune responses that contribute to the long-term consequences of pulmonary complication in COVID-19 infection remain unclear. Few studies have detailed the immune and cytokine profiles associated with post-acute sequalae of SARS-CoV-2 infection with persistent pulmonary symptoms (PPASC). However, the dysregulation of the immune system that drives pulmonary sequelae in COVID-19 survivors and PASC sufferers remains largely unknown.\n\nResultsTo characterize the immunological features of pulmonary PASC (PPASC), we performed droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing to study the transcriptomic profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from participants naive to SARS-CoV-2 (Control) and infected with SARS-CoV-2 with chronic pulmonary symptoms (PPASC). We analyzed more than 34,139 PBMCs by integrating our dataset with previously reported control datasets (GSM4509024) cell distribution. In total, 11 distinct cell populations were identified based on the expression of canonical markers. The proportion of myeloid-lineage cells ([MLCs]; CD14+/CD16+monocytes and dendritic cells) was increased in PPASC compared to controls. MLCs from PPASC displayed up-regulation of genes associated with pulmonary symptoms/fibrosis, while glycolysis metabolism-related genes were downregulated. Similarly, pathway analysis showed that fibrosis- related (VEGF, WNT, and SMAD) and cell death pathways were up-regulated, but immune pathways were down-regulated in PPASC. In PPASC, we observed interactive VEGF ligand- receptor pairs among MLCs, and network modules in CD14+ (cluster 4) and CD16+ (Cluster 5) monocytes displayed a significant enrichment for biological pathways linked to adverse COVID- 19 outcomes, fibrosis, and angiogenesis. Further analysis revealed a distinct metabolic alteration in MLCs with a down-regulation of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis in PPASC compared to SARS- CoV-2 naive samples.\n\nConclusionThis study offers valuable insights into the immune response and cellular landscape in PPASC. The presence of elevated MLC levels and their corresponding gene signatures associated with fibrosis, immune response suppression, and altered metabolic states suggests their potential role as a driver of PPASC.",

    "abstract": "Deep mutational scanning (DMS) is a high-throughput experimental technique that measures the effects of thousands of mutations to a protein. These experiments can be performed on multiple homologs of a protein or on the same protein selected under multiple conditions. It is often of biological interest to identify mutations with shifted effects across homologs or conditions. However, it is challenging to determine if observed shifts arise from biological signal or experimental noise. Here, we describe a method for jointly inferring mutational effects across multiple DMS experiments while also identifying mutations that have shifted in their effects among experiments. A key aspect of our method is to regularize the inferred shifts, so that they are nonzero only when strongly supported by the data. We apply this method to DMS experiments that measure how mutations to spike proteins from SARS-CoV-2 variants (Delta, Omicron BA.1, and Omicron BA.2) affect cell entry. Most mutational effects are conserved between these spike homologs, but a fraction have markedly shifted. We experimentally validate a subset of the mutations inferred to have shifted effects, and confirm differences of >1,000-fold in the impact of the same mutation on spike-mediated viral infection across spikes from different SARS-CoV-2 variants. Overall, our work establishes a general approach for comparing sets of DMS experiments to identify biologically important shifts in mutational effects.\n\nSignificance StatementAmino-acid mutations to a protein have effects that can shift as the protein evolves or is put under new selective pressure. The effects of amino-acid mutations to a specific protein under a defined selective pressure can be measured by deep mutational scanning experiments. Here, we devise an approach to quantify shifts in mutational effects between experiments performed on different homologs (i.e. variants) of the same protein, or on the same protein selected under different conditions. We use this approach to compare experiments performed on three homologs of SARS-CoV-2 spike, identifying mutations that have shifted in their effect on spike-mediated viral infection by >1,000 fold across SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic nuclear genomes often encode distinct sets of protein translation machinery for function in the cytosol vs. organelles (mitochondria and plastids). This phenomenon raises questions about why multiple translation systems are maintained even though they are capable of comparable functions, and whether they evolve differently depending on the compartment where they operate. These questions are particularly interesting in land plants because translation machinery, including aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS), is often dual-targeted to both the plastids and mitochondria. These two organelles have quite different metabolisms, with much higher rates of translation in plastids to supply the abundant, rapid-turnover proteins required for photosynthesis. Previous studies have indicated that plant organellar aaRS evolve more slowly compared to mitochondrial aaRS in other eukaryotes that lack plastids. Thus, we investigated the evolution of nuclear-encoded organellar and cytosolic translation machinery across a broad sampling of angiosperms, including non-photosynthetic (heterotrophic) plant species with reduced rates of plastid gene expression to test the hypothesis that translational demands associated with photosynthesis constrain the evolution of bacterial-like enzymes involved in organellar tRNA metabolism. Remarkably, heterotrophic plants exhibited wholesale loss of many organelle-targeted aaRS and other enzymes, even though translation still occurs in their mitochondria and plastids. These losses were often accompanied by apparent retargeting of cytosolic enzymes and tRNAs to the organelles, sometimes preserving aaRS-tRNA charging relationships but other times creating surprising mismatches between cytosolic aaRS and mitochondrial tRNA substrates. Our findings indicate that the presence of a photosynthetic plastid drives the retention of specialized systems for organellar tRNA metabolism.\n\nSignificanceThe process by which endosymbionts are integrated into a host and become organelles results in a combination of gene loss, transfer to the nucleus, and retention in the organellar genome. It is not well understood why some endosymbiont-derived genes may be retained when a functional host counterpart exists whose gene product could simply be retargeted to the organelles. This study revealed that the photosynthetic activity in plant plastids may be responsible for retention of functionally redundant tRNA processing machinery, while mitochondria are more flexible regarding substitution with cytosolic type enzymes. Therefore, functional constraint in the plastid is likely more important than in the mitochondria for shaping the evolution and retention of translation machinery that is dual-targeted to both organelles.",

    "abstract": "Renal carcinoma is a pathology of silent and multifactorial development characterized by a high rate of metastases in patients. After several studies have elucidated the activity of coding genes in the metastatic progression of renal carcinoma, new studies seek to evaluate the association of non-coding genes, such as competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA). Thus, this study aims to build a gene signature for clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) associated with metastatic development from a ceRNA network and to analyze the probable biological functions performed by the participants of the signature. Using ccRCC data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we constructed the ceRNA network with the differentially expressed genes, assembled nine gene signatures from eight feature selection techniques, and analyzed the evaluation metrics of the classification models in the benchmarking process. With the signature, we performed somatic and copy number alteration analysis, survival and metastatic progression risk analysis, and functional annotation analysis. In this study, we present an 11-gene signature (SNHG15, AF117829.1, hsa-miR-130a-3p, hsa-mir-381-3p, BTBD11, INSR, HECW2, RFLNB, PTTG1, HMMR, RASD1). Validation using the external dataset of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC-RECA) made it possible to assess the generalization of the signature, which showed an Area Under Curve of 81.5%. The genomic analysis identified the signature participants on chromosomes with highly mutated regions (G-index > 2). The hsa-miR-130a-3p, AF117829.1, hsa-miR-381-3p, and PTTG1 had a significant relationship between expression and patient survival, and the first two had a significant association with metastatic development. In addition, functional annotation resulted in relevant pathways for tumor development, such as PI3K/AKT, TNF, FoxO, RNA polymerase two transcription regulation, and cell control. Finally, by analyzing the connections of the signature genes within the ceRNA network in conjunction with studies in the literature, it was possible to obtain an overview of their activities within the ccRCC. Therefore, this gene signature identified new coding and non-coding genes and could act as potential biomarkers for a better understanding of renal carcinoma and in the development of future treatments in the clinical area.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGlobally, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, primarily non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Oncogene Homolog (KRAS) mutations are common in NSCLC and linked to a poor prognosis. Covalent inhibitors targeting KRAS-G12C mutation have improved treatment for some patients, but most KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma (KRAS-MT LUAD) cases lack targeted therapies. More research is required to identify prognostic genes in KRAS-MT LUAD.\n\nObjectiveWe aimed to identify hub genes within key co-expression gene network modules specifically associated with KRAS-MT LUAD. These hub genes hold the potential to serve as therapeutic targets or biomarkers, providing insights into the pathogenesis and prognosis of lung cancer.\n\nMethodsWe performed a comprehensive analysis on KRAS-MT LUAD using diverse data sources. This included TCGA project data for RNA-seq, clinical information, and somatic mutations, along with RNA-seq data for adjacent normal tissues. DESeq2 identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs), while weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) revealed co-expression modules. Overlapping genes between DEGs and co-expression module with the highest significance were analyzed using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. Hub genes were identified with the Maximal Clique Centrality (MCC) algorithm in Cytoscape. Prognostic significance was assessed through survival analysis and validated using the GSE72094 dataset from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database.\n\nResultsIn KRAS-MT LUAD, 3,122 DEGs were found (2,131 up-regulated, 985 down-regulated). The blue module, among 25 co-expression modules from WGCNA, had the strongest correlation. 804 genes overlapped between DEGs and the blue module. Among twenty hub genes in the blue module, leucine-rich repeats containing G protein-coupled receptor 4 (LGR4) overexpression correlated with worse overall survival (OS) in KRAS-MT LUAD patients (P=0.012). The prognostic significance of LGR4 was confirmed using GSE72094, but surprisingly, the direction of the association was opposite to what was expected.\n\nConclusionLGR4 is a potential prognostic biomarker in KRAS-MT LUAD. Contrasting associations in TCGA and GSE72094 datasets reveal the complexity of KRAS-MT LUAD. Further investigations are required to understand LGR4s role in lung adenocarcinoma prognosis, especially in the context of KRAS mutations.",

    "abstract": "Plant root systems play a pivotal role in plant physiology and exhibit diverse phenotypic traits. Understanding the genetic mechanisms governing root growth and development in model plants like maize is crucial for enhancing crop resilience to drought and nutrient limitations. This study focused on identifying and characterizing ZmPILS6, an annotated auxin efflux carrier, as a key regulator of various crown root traits in maize. ZmPILS6-modified roots displayed reduced network area and suppressed lateral root formation, desirable traits during drought and low phosphate conditions. The research revealed that ZmPILS6 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and plays a vital role in controlling the spatial distribution of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA or \"auxin\") in primary roots. The study also demonstrated that ZmPILS6 can actively efflux IAA when expressed in yeast. Furthermore, the loss of ZmPILS6 resulted in significant proteome remodeling in maize roots, particularly affecting hormone signaling pathways. To identify potential interacting partners of ZmPILS6, a weighted gene co-expression analysis (WGNA) was performed. Altogether, this research contributes to the growing knowledge of essential genetic determinants governing maize root morphogenesis, which is crucial for guiding agricultural improvement strategies.\n\nSignificance StatementCrop yield and stress resilience are significantly influenced by crown root architecture. A reverse genetic screen aimed at identifying novel regulators of maize root morphogenesis led to the discovery of ZmPILS6, an auxin efflux carrier. The loss of ZmPILS6 negatively impacts numerous root traits that are linked to plant physiology and function. Proteomic characterization of pils6-1 roots revealed that this evolutionarily conserved transporter is required for the proper expression of numerous phytohormone pathways, including abscisic acid, gibberellins, and jasmonic acid. Notably, ZmPILS6 appears to have a contrasting role in regulating root morphogenesis compared to its Arabidopsis ortholog, PILS6. This finding emphasizes the need for functional characterization of candidate genes directly within key crops of interest, which cannot always be correctly inferred from other model plants.",

    "abstract": "Tick-borne flaviviruses (TBFV) can cause severe neuroinvasive disease which may result in death or long-term neurological deficit in over 50% of survivors. Multiple mechanisms for invasion of the central nervous system (CNS) by flaviviruses have been proposed including axonal transport, transcytosis, endothelial infection, and Trojan horse routes. Flaviviruses may utilize different or multiple mechanisms of neuroinvasion depending on the specific virus, infection site, and host variability. In this work we have shown that infection of BALB/cJ mice with either Powassan virus lineage I (Powassan virus) or lineage II (Deer tick virus) results in distinct spatial tropism of infection in the CNS which correlated with unique clinical presentation for each lineage. Comparative transcriptomics of infected brains demonstrates activation of different immune pathways and suggests that in this model CNS invasion occurs via transport into the spinal cord and brain stem during Powassan virus infection rather than through forebrain structures in Deer tick virus infection. These results implicate distinct modes of neuroinvasion into and dissemination within the CNS that ultimately dictate the differential pathogenesis of these clinically important emerging viruses.\n\nAuthor SummaryPowassan virus causes a nationally notifiable disease which can cause severe neurological disease in humans and has no approved vaccines or therapeutics. Although two distinct lineages circulate in North America, clinical differentiation is not typically performed, and pathology has been assumed to be similar between lineages. In this work, a direct comparison of lineage I (Powassan virus) and lineage II (Deer tick virus) demonstrated distinct differences in the clinical presentation, pathology of the central nervous system, and immune response in immunocompetent mice. These differences suggest that Deer tick virus and Powassan virus do not utilize the same mechanisms for neuroinvasion and dissemination within the CNS. This is clinically relevant as the development of treatment plans and therapeutics need to be evaluated for these virus lineages.",

    "abstract": "Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a globally distributed sexually transmitted bacterial pathogen. Recent studies have revealed that its evolution has been shaped by antibiotic use, while molecular surveillance efforts have demonstrated large changes in lineage composition over relatively short time-spans. However, the global population dynamics of N. gonorrhoeae remain unsatisfyingly characterized.\n\nTo reconstruct recent large-scale population dynamics, we generated a dated phylogeny from 9,732 N. gonorrhoeae genomes and found the effective population size of the species to have expanded gradually over the past two centuries. While the effective population size of clades with reduced susceptibility to extended-spectrum cephalosporins started declining around 2010, a major clade containing a mosaic mtr operon associated with cephalosporin susceptibility and decreased azithromycin did not display any reduction in population size.\n\nUsing ancestral trait reconstruction analyses, we delineated transmission lineages, defined as groups of sequences in which all the samples can be traced back to the same import event to a given location. Import, export and local transmission dynamics across two densely sampled locations (Norway and Victoria, Australia) were investigated in detail. Norway exhibited substantially higher rates of strain import and export compared to Victoria, where incidence was to a larger extent fuelled by locally transmitted lineages. Taken together, our work highlights the power of large-scale phylogenomic analyses to uncover the complex dynamics of lineage transmission in N. gonorrhoeae.",

    "abstract": "Primary differentiated human epithelial cell cultures have been widely used by researchers to study viral fitness and virus-host interactions, especially during the COVID19 pandemic. These cultures recapitulate important characteristics of the respiratory epithelium such as diverse cell type composition, polarization, and innate immune responses. However, standardization and validation of these cultures remains an open issue. In this study, two different expansion medias were evaluated and the impact on the resulting differentiated culture was determined. Use of both Airway and Ex Plus media types resulted in high quality, consistent cultures that were able to be used for these studies. Upon histological evaluation, Airway-grown cultures were more organized and had a higher proportion of basal progenitor cells while Ex Plus-grown cultures had a higher proportion terminally differentiated cell types. In addition to having different cell type proportions and organization, the two different growth medias led to cultures with altered susceptibility to infection with SARS-CoV-2 but not Influenza A virus. RNAseq comparing cultures grown in different growth medias prior to differentiation uncovered a high degree of differentially expressed genes in cultures from the same donor. RNAseq on differentiated cultures showed less variation between growth medias but alterations in pathways that control the expression of human transmembrane proteases including TMPRSS11 and TMPRSS2 were documented. Enhanced susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 cannot be explained by altered cell type proportions alone, rather serine protease cofactor expression also contributes to the enhanced replication of SARS-CoV-2 as inhibition with camostat affected replication of an early SARS-CoV-2 variant and a Delta, but not Omicron, variant showed difference in replication efficiency between culture types. Therefore, it is important for the research community to standardize cell culture protocols particularly when characterizing novel viruses.",

However, the lack of practices of sharing research outputs, such as data, source code and methods, affects transparency and reproducibility of studies, which are critical to the advancement of science. Many published studies are not reproducible due to insufficient documentation, code, and data being shared. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of 453 manuscripts published between 2016-2021 and found that 50.1% of them fail to share the analytical code. Even among those that did disclose their code, a vast majority failed to offer additional research outputs, such as data. Furthermore, only one in ten papers organized their code in a structured and reproducible manner. We discovered a significant association between the presence of code availability statements and increased code availability (p=2.71x10-9). Additionally, a greater proportion of studies conducting secondary analyses were inclined to share their code compared to those conducting primary analyses (p=1.15*10-07). In light of our findings, we propose raising awareness of code sharing practices and taking immediate steps to enhance code availability to improve reproducibility in biomedical research. By increasing transparency and reproducibility, we can promote scientific rigor, encourage collaboration, and accelerate scientific discoveries.

We applied Density-PINN to single-cell gene expression data from 16 promoters regulated by unknown pathways in response to antibiotic stresses. We found that promoters with slower signaling initiation and transduction exhibit larger cell-to-cell heterogeneity in response intensity.

    "abstract": "Cells require disparate amounts of distinct amino acids, which themselves have discrete biosynthetic costs. However, it remains unclear if and how cells respond differently to their scarcity. To explore this, we re-organized amino acids into distinct groups based on their metabolic origins. Subsequently, using yeast we assessed responses to transient disruptions in amino acid supply, and uncover diverse restoration responses for distinct amino acids. Cells hierarchically prioritize restoring glutamate-, sulfur-, pentose-phosphate- and pyruvate-derived amino acids. Particularly, the strongest response is to the glutamate-derived amino acid arginine. We find that the extent and priority of the restoration response is determined by the composite demand for an amino acid, coupled with low individual biosynthetic costs of that amino acid. We propose that cells employ a conserved strategy guided by the law of demand, to prioritize amino acids restoration upon transient limitation.",

    "abstract": "Influenza A virus (IAV) causes up to five million cases of severe illness and half a million deaths worldwide each year. While there are a few clinically approved drugs for treating IAV, they are challenged by the rapid evolution of the virus leading to emergence of drug resistance and the adverse effects of the drugs. Targeting host cellular factors that support virus replication could limit resistance, increase the broad-spectrum antiviral properties of drugs, and benefit from repurposing drugs already existing against those factors. However, selecting the right drug-target pairs with low toxicity and minimal adverse effects has been challenging, even though hundreds of cellular host factors have been identified. In this study, we applied a computational and knowledge-based drug-target prioritization approach to identify promising drug-target pairs. We selected five pairs for experimental validation: telmisartan-Angiotensin II receptor, type 1 (AGTR1), metoclopramide hydrochloride-Cholinergic receptor muscarinic 1 (CHRM1), cefepime hydrochloride-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGD), ranolazine dihydrochloride-sodium channel voltage-gated type v alpha subunit (SCN5A), and ofloxacin-topoisomerase II alpha 170kDa (TOP2A). Except for cefepime hydrochloride, all four drugs showed significant plaque reduction in Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. In the immunofluorescence assay, metoclopramide hydrochloride, ranolazine dihydrochloride, and telmisartan showed antiviral activity in MDCK and/or adenocarcinoma human alveolar basal epithelial (A549) cell lines. In conclusion, our approach can prioritize and identify drugs with antiviral activity against influenza virus. Refining and strengthening such approaches could be valuable for rapid antiviral discovery and pandemic preparedness.\n\nHighlightsO_LIComputational drug-target prioritization indicated drugs for validation\nC_LIO_LITelmisartan showed anti-influenza virus activity in MDCK cells\nC_LIO_LIMetoclopramide and ranolazine showed anti-influenza activity in A549 and MDCK cells\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Dysregulated microglia activation, leading to neuroinflammation, is crucial in neurodegenerative disease development and progression. The initial M1/M2 dual activation classification for microglia is outdated. Even the  disease-associated microglia (DAM) phenotype, firstly described in mice, falls short in representing the diverse microglia phenotypes in pathology. In this study, we have constructed a transcriptomic atlas of human brain immune cells by integrating single-nucleus (sn)RNA-seq datasets from multiple neurodegenerative conditions. Sixteen datasets were included, comprising 295 samples from patients with Alzheimers disease, autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Lewy body diseases, COVID-19, and healthy controls. The integrated Human Microglia Atlas (HuMicA) dataset included 60,557 nuclei and revealed 11 microglial subpopulations distributed across all pathological and healthy conditions. Among these, we identified four different homeostatic clusters as well as pathological phenotypes. These included two stages of early and late activation of the DAM phenotype and the disease-inflammatory macrophage (DIM) phenotype, which was recently described in mice, and is also present in human microglia, as indicated by our analysis. The high versatility of microglia is evident through changes in subset distribution across various pathologies, suggesting their contribution in shaping pathological phenotypes. Our analysis showed overall depletion of four substates of homeostatic microglia, and expansion of niche subpopulations within the DAM and DIM spectrum across distinct neurodegenerative pathologies. The HuMicA is invaluable in advancing the study of microglia biology in both healthy and disease settings.",

    "abstract": "Critical Gram-negative pathogens, like Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas and Burkholderia, have become resistant to most antibiotics. Complex resistance profiles together with synergistic interactions between these organisms increase the likelihood of treatment failure in distinct infection settings, for example in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. Here, we discover that cell envelope protein homeostasis pathways underpin both antibiotic resistance and cross-protection in CF-associated bacteria. We find that inhibition of oxidative protein folding inactivates multiple species-specific resistance proteins. Using this strategy, we sensitize multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa to {beta}-lactam antibiotics and demonstrate promise of new treatment avenues for the recalcitrant pathogen Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The same approach also inhibits cross-protection between resistant S. maltophilia and susceptible P. aeruginosa, allowing eradication of both commonly co-occurring CF-associated organisms. Our results provide the basis for the development of next-generation strategies that target antibiotic resistance, while also impairing specific interbacterial interactions that enhance the severity of polymicrobial infections.",

    "abstract": "Chlamydia, an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen, has a unique developmental cycle involving the differentiation of invading elementary bodies (EBs) to noninfectious reticulate bodies (RBs), replication of RBs, and redifferentiation of RBs into progeny EBs. Progression of this cycle is regulated by three sigma factors, which direct the RNA polymerase to their respective target gene promoters. We hypothesized that the Chlamydia-specific transcriptional regulator GrgA, previously shown to activate {sigma}66 and {sigma}28, plays an essential role in chlamydial development and growth. To test this hypothesis, we applied a novel genetic tool known as dependence on plasmid-mediated expression (DOPE) to create Chlamydia trachomatis with conditional GrgA-deficiency. We show that GrgA-deficient C. trachomatis RBs have a growth rate that is approximately half of the normal rate and fail to transition into progeny EBs. In addition, GrgA-deficient C. trachomatis fail to maintain its virulence plasmid. Results of RNA-seq analysis indicate that GrgA promotes RB growth by optimizing tRNA synthesis and expression of nutrient-acquisition genes, while it enables RB-to-EB conversion by facilitating the expression of a histone and outer membrane proteins required for EB morphogenesis. GrgA also regulates numerous other late genes required for host cell exit and subsequent EB invasion into host cells. Importantly, GrgA stimulates the expression of {sigma}54, the third and last sigma factor, and its activator AtoC, and thereby indirectly upregulating the expression of {sigma}54-dependent genes. In conclusion, our work demonstrates that GrgA is a master transcriptional regulator in Chlamydia and plays multiple essential roles in chlamydial pathogenicity.\n\nIMPORTANCEHallmarks of the developmental cycle of the obligate intracellular pathogenic bacterium Chlamydia are the primary differentiation of the infectious elementary body (EB) into the proliferative reticulate body (RB) and the secondary differentiation of RBs back into EBs. The mechanisms regulating these transitions remain unclear. In this report, we developed an effective novel strategy termed DOPE that allows for the knockdown of essential genes in Chlamydia. We demonstrate that GrgA, a Chlamydia-specific transcription factor, is essential for the secondary differentiation and optimal growth of RBs. We also show that GrgA, a chromosome-encoded regulatory protein, controls the maintenance of the chlamydial virulence plasmid. Transcriptomic analysis further indicates that GrgA functions as a critical regulator of all three sigma factors that recognize different promoter sets at developmental stages. The DOPE strategy outlined here should provide a valuable tool for future studies examining chlamydial growth, development, and pathogenicity.",

    "abstract": "We report the isolation of Paracoccus onubensis strain Merri, which can grow on the rare sulfosugar sulfofucose (6-deoxy-6-sulfo-D-galactose) as sole carbon source, leading to its breakdown and release of sulfite. Genome sequencing and comparative proteomics of samples grown on glucose versus sulfofucose identified a genetic locus containing most of the genes for a sulfoglycolytic pathway for breakdown of sulfofucose to the 3-carbon organosulfonate sulfolactaldehyde, and a biomineralization pathway for catabolism of sulfolactaldehyde to pyruvate and sulfite. A candidate sulfotagatose-1-phosphate aldolase was expressed and was active on the epimeric substrate sulfofructose-1-phosphate. Its 3D X-ray structure revealed a close homology to sulfofructose-1-phosphate aldolase from the sulfoglycolytic Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway. A patchwork sulfofucose catabolism pathway is proposed involving a sulfofucolytic Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas and short-chain organosulfonate biomineralization pathway.\n\nSignificanceSulfosugars are important compounds in the biogeochemical sulfur cycle and are produced by a wide range of photosynthetic plants, algae and cyanobacteria. While the pathways for the biosynthesis and catabolism of sulfoquinovose are well studied, much less is known about the rarer sulfosugar sulfofucose. We report a bacterium that can use sulfofucose as sole carbon source and achieve its complete breakdown to produce sulfite. We propose that sulfofucose catabolism is achieved using enzymes of the sulfoglycolytic Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway that tolerate a change in stereochemistry at C4 of the sulfosugar. The sulfolactaldehyde output of this pathway is broken down to sulfite through a biomineralization pathway via sulfolactate. Microbial metabolism of this rare sulfosugar can be achieved through repurposing enzymes within known sulfosugar and short-chain organosulfonate catabolism catabolism.",

    "abstract": "The gut physiology of pediatric and adult persons with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) is altered relative to healthy persons. The CF gut is characterized, in part, as having excess mucus, increased fat content, acidic pH, increased inflammation, increased antibiotic perturbation and the potential for increased oxygen availability. These physiological differences shift nutritional availability and the local environment for intestinal microbes, thus likely driving significant changes in microbial metabolism, colonization and competition with other microbes. The impact of any specific change in this physiological landscape is difficult to parse using human or animal studies. Thus, we have developed a novel culture medium representative of the CF gut environment, inclusive of all the aforementioned features. This medium, called CF-MiPro, maintains CF gut microbiome communities, while significantly shifting non-CF gut microbiome communities toward a CF-like microbial profile, characterized by low Bacteroidetes and high Proteobacteria abundance. This medium is able to maintain this culture composition for up to 5 days of passage. Additionally, microbial communities passaged in CF-MiPro produce significantly less immunomodulatory short chain fatty acids (SCFA), including propionate and butyrate, than communities passaged in MiPro, a culture medium representative of healthy gut physiology, confirming not only a shift in microbial composition but altered community function. Our results support the potential for this in vitro culture medium as a new tool for the study of gut dysbiosis in CF.\n\nImportanceCystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease that disrupts ion transport at mucosal surfaces, leading to mucus accumulation and altered physiology of both the lungs and the intestines, among other organs, with the resulting altered environment contributing to an imbalance of microbial communities. Culture media representative of the CF airway have been developed and validated; however, no such medium exists for modeling the CF intestine. Here, we develop and validate a first-generation culture medium inclusive of features that are altered in the CF colon. Our findings suggest this novel medium, called CF-MiPro, as a maintenance medium for CF gut microbiome samples and a flexible tool for studying key drivers of CF-associated gut dysbiosis.",

To date, it has not been shown whether (-)-CBC, (+)-CBC (or both) can mediate these effects. In this study we investigate the activity of the CBC enantiomers at CB1, CB2 and TRPA1 in vitro.\n\nMaterials and MethodsCBC enantiomers were purified from synthetic CBC by chiral chromatography, and their optical activity was confirmed by spectroscopy. Human CB1 and CB2 receptor activity was measured using a fluorescent assay of membrane potential in stably transfected AtT20 cells. TRPA1 activation was measured using a fluorescent assay of intracellular calcium in stably transfected HEK293 cells.\n\nResults(-)-CBC activated CB2 with an EC50 of 1.5 {micro}M, to a maximum of 60 % of CP55940. (+)-CBC did not activate CB2 at concentrations up to 30 {micro}M. Only 30 {micro}M (-)- CBC produced detectable activation of CB1, (+)-CBC was inactive. Both (-)-CBC and (+)- CBC activated TRPA1; at 30 {micro}M (-)-CBC produced an activation 50% of that of the reference agonist cinnamaldehyde (300 {micro}M), 30 {micro}M (+)-CBC activated TRPA1 to 38% of the cinnamaldehyde maximum.\n\nDiscussionIt is unclear whether (-)-CBC is the sole or even the predominant enantiomer of CBC enzymatically synthesized in Cannabis. This study shows that (-)-CBC is the active isomer at CB2 receptors, while both isomers activate TRPA1.

    "abstract": "V-type ATPases are highly conserved hetero-multi-subunit proton pumping machineries found in all eukaryotic organisms. They use ATP hydrolysis to pump protons, acidifying intracellular or extracellular compartments, and are thus crucial for various biological processes. Despite being evolutionarily conserved in malaria parasites, this proton pump remains understudied. To understand the localization and biological function of V-type ATPase in the deadliest human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, we utilized CRISPR/Cas9 to endogenously tag the subunit A of the V1 domain at the C-terminus. V1A (PF3D7_1311900) was tagged with a triple hemagglutinin (3HA) epitope and TetR-DOZI-aptamers for conditional expression under the regulation of anhydrotetracycline. Through immunofluorescence assays, we identified that V-type ATPase was expressed throughout the intraerythrocytic developmental cycle and was mainly localized on the digestive vacuole and plasma membrane. Immuno-electron microscopy further revealed that V-type ATPase was also localized on secretory organelles, such as rhoptries in merozoites. Knockdown of V1A led to cytosolic pH imbalance and blockage of hemoglobin digestion in the digestive vacuole, resulting in an arrest of parasite development in the trophozoite stage and, ultimately, parasite demise. Using BN-PAGE/Western blot, we detected a large molecular weight complex ([~] 1.0 MDa) corresponding to the total molecular weights of V1 and Vo domains. The complex was readily disrupted by the V-type ATPase specific inhibitor Bafilomycin A1, but not by low glucose conditions or treatment with chloroquine. Together, our data suggest that V-type ATPase is localized on several subcellular compartments in P. falciparum and plays critical roles to support malaria parasites to grow and replicate inside red blood cells.",

    "abstract": "Daptomycin is a last-resort lipopeptide antibiotic that disrupts cell membrane (CM) and peptidoglycan homeostasis. Enterococcus faecalis has developed a sophisticated mechanism to avoid daptomycin killing by re-distributing CM anionic phospholipids away from the septum. The CM changes are orchestrated by a three-component regulatory system, designated LiaFSR, with a possible contribution of cardiolipin synthase (Cls). However, the mechanism by which LiaFSR controls the CM response and the role of Cls are unknown. Here, we show that cardiolipin synthase activity is essential for anionic phospholipid redistribution and daptomycin resistance since deletion of the two genes (cls1 and cls2) encoding Cls abolished CM remodeling. We identified LiaY, a transmembrane protein regulated by LiaFSR, as an important mediator of CM remodeling required for re-distribution of anionic phospholipid microdomains via interactions with Cls1. Together, our insights provide a mechanistic framework on the enterococcal response to cell envelope antibiotics that could be exploited therapeutically.",

Here, we report small enigmatic linear ECEs, circular viruses and unclassified ECEs, that we predict replicate within Methanoperedens. The linear ECEs have features such as inverted terminal repeats, pervasive tandem repeats, and coding patterns that are strongly reminiscent of Borgs, but they are only 52 kb to 145 kb in length. They share proteins with Borgs and Methanoperedens. Thus, we refer to them as mini-Borgs. Mini-Borgs are genetically diverse and we assign them to at least five family-level groups. We also identify eight novel families of Methanoperedens viruses, some of which encode multiheme cytochromes, and unclassified circular ECEs that encode TnpB genes. A population-heterogeneous CRISPR array is in close proximity to the TnpB and has spacers that target other Methanoperedens ECEs including previously reported plasmids.

    "abstract": "A hallmark of animals is the coordination of whole-body movement. Neurons and muscles are central to this, yet coordinated movements also exist in sponges that lack these cell types. Sponges are sessile animals with a complex canal system for filter-feeding. They undergo whole-body movements resembling \"contractions\" that lead to canal closure and water expulsion. Here, we combine 3D optical coherence microscopy, pharmacology, and functional proteomics to elucidate anatomy, molecular physiology, and control of these movements. We find them driven by the relaxation of actomyosin stress fibers in epithelial canal cells, which leads to whole-body deflation via collapse of the incurrent and expansion of the excurrent system, controlled by an Akt/NO/PKG/A pathway. A concomitant increase in reactive oxygen species and secretion of proteinases and cytokines indicate an inflammation-like state reminiscent of vascular endothelial cells experiencing oscillatory shear stress.

    "abstract": "Cardiac injury, such as myocardial infarction (MI), results in permanent loss of cardiomyocytes and in many cases heart failure. Transgenic expression of the pro-proliferative transcription factor Myc and Cyclin T1 can drive substantial adult cardiomyocyte proliferation to replace lost cardiomyocytes. Herein, we show that Myc and Cyclin T1 induced cardiomyocyte proliferation leads to myocardial repair and functional (long-term) recovery post-MI in mice. To provide a more translational approach, we developed modified mRNA (modRNA) encoding Myc-Ccnt1 as a transient and non-integrating strategy for regeneration. One dose of Myc-Ccnt1 modRNA is sufficient to transiently drives cardiomyocyte proliferation in human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and a mouse MI model, where it leads to better heart function. Using single nuclei sequencing and proteomics, we show this was functionally mediated by transcriptional activation of cell-cycle regulating genes, which ultimately results in mitosis and cytokinesis of cardiomyocytes. Collectively, these findings indicate that Myc-Ccnt1 modRNA has the potential to be an effective regenerative therapeutic.",

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis causes progressive joint deterioration, severe morbidity, and reduced mobility in both humans and horses. Currently, osteoarthritis is diagnosed at late stages through clinical examination and radiographic imaging, hence it is challenging to address and provide timely therapeutic interventions to slow disease progression or ameliorate symptoms. Extracellular vesicles are cell-derived vesicles that play a key role in cell-to-cell communication and are potential sources for specific composite biomarker panel discovery. We here used a multi-omics strategy combining proteomics and phospholipidomics in an integral approach to identify composite biomarkers associated to purified extracellular vesicles from synovial fluid of healthy, mildly and severely osteoarthritic equine joints. Although the number of extracellular vesicles was unaffected by osteoarthritis, proteome profiling of extracellular vesicles by mass spectrometry identified 40 differentially expressed proteins (non-adjusted p<0.05) in osteoarthritic joints associated with 7 significant canonical pathways in osteoarthritis. Moreover, pathway analysis unveiled changes in disease and molecular functions during osteoarthritis development. Phospholipidome profiling by mass spectrometry showed a relative increase in sphingomyelin and a decrease in phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylserine in extracellular vesicles derived from osteoarthritic joints compared to healthy joints. Unsupervised data integration revealed positive correlations between the proteome and the phospholipidome. Comprehensive analysis showed that some phospholipids and their related proteins increased as the severity of osteoarthritis progressed, while others decreased or remained stable. Altogether our data show interrelationships between synovial fluid extracellular vesicle-associated phospholipids and proteins responding to osteoarthritis pathology and which could be explored as potential composite diagnostic biomarkers of disease.",

    "abstract": "The Min system contributes to the spatiotemporal regulation of division sites in Escherichia coli. The MinD and MinE proteins of this system self-organize into oscillatory waves in the form of concentration gradients. How the intracellular Min protein concentration gradients are coordinated with cell growth to achieve spatiotemporal accuracy of cell division is unknown. Here, we report that the MinD concentration gradient becomes progressively steeper as cells elongate, suggesting that the division inhibitory activity at the midcell also decreases with cell growth. Interestingly, the oscillation period appears relatively stable across different cell lengths. Similar features were found in cells under carbon stress conditions, but the gradient was even steeper, likely favoring division at shorter cell lengths. The length-dependent variation of the concentration gradient was further examined in silico using a reaction-diffusion model, which not only supported the above features, but also revealed a decrease in the midcell concentration as the shape of the gradient becomes steeper in growing cells. This growth-dependent regulation of the midcell concentration of MinD may be coupled with the FtsZ ring formation through the MinD-interacting protein MinC. We found that the variable concentration gradients occur by coordinating the reaction rates of the recruitment of MinD and MinE to the membrane and the recharging of MinD with ATP in the cytoplasm. In conclusion, this work uncovers the plasticity of MinD concentration gradients during interpolar oscillations throughout cell growth, an intrinsic property integrated during cell division.",

We produced the first large-scale CRISPR/Cas9-induced library in a non-model multicellular organism, Bombyx mori. We developed a piggyBac-delivered binary genome editing strategy, which can simultaneously meet the requirements of mixed microinjection, efficient multi-purpose genetic operation, and preservation of growth-defect lines. We constructed a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) plasmid library containing 92,917 sgRNAs targeting promoters and exons of 14,645 protein-coding genes, established 1726 transgenic sgRNA lines following microinjection of 66,650 embryos, and generated 300 mutant lines with diverse phenotypic changes. Phenomic characterization of mutant lines identified a large set of genes responsible for visual phenotypic or economically valuable trait changes. Next, we performed pooled context-specific positive screens for tolerance to environmental pollute cadmium exposure, and identified KWMTBOMO12902 as a strong candidate gene for breeding applications in sericulture industry. Collectively, our results provide a novel and versatile approach for functional B. mori genomics, and a powerful resource for identifying key candidate genes potential for improving various economic traits.

Compared to WT mosquitoes, mosGILTnull A. gambiae demonstrated altered expression of genes related to oogenesis, 20-hydroxyecdysone synthesis, as well as immune-related genes. Serendipitously, the zero population growth gene, zpg, an essential regulator of germ cell development was found to be one of the most downregulated genes in mosGILTnull mosquitoes. These results provide the crucial missing link between two previous studies on the role of zpg and mosGILT in ovarian development.

These molecules are biosynthesized by polyketide synthases (PKSs) comprised of a core ketosynthase-chain length factor (KS-CLF) and phosphopantetheinylated acyl carrier protein (holo-ACP). While engineering type II PKSs holds potential to unlock sustainable access to diverse bioactive molecules, the inability to obtain cognate type II KS-CLFs and holo-ACPs for in vitro studies represents a longstanding barrier. Herein, we share how the sequence and structural analysis of the Gloeocapsa sp. PCC 7428 ACP allowed us to tune to a requisite weak yet specific interaction with a phosphopantetheinyl transferase to afford the holo-ACP. This, coupled with our ability to heterologously express the cognate KS-CLF in high quantities, unlocked access to polyketide products via in vitro multienzyme assembly. We hope this work inspires future studies of type II PKSs that have previously evaded heterologous expression or have yet to be explored.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=90 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/551649v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d96db2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b0e3eaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@435509org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8402a1_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Antiviral DNA cytosine deaminases APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B are major sources of mutations in cancer by catalyzing cytosine-to-uracil deamination. APOBEC3A preferentially targets singlestranded DNAs, with a noted affinity for DNA regions that adopt stem-loop secondary structures. However, the detailed substrate preferences of APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B have been fully established, and the specific influence of the DNA sequence on APOBEC3A APOBEC3B deaminase activity remains to be investigated. Here, we find that APOBEC3B selectively targets DNA stem-loop structures, and they are distinct from those subjected deamination by APOBEC3A. We develop Oligo-seq, a novel in vitro sequencing-based to identify specific sequence contexts promoting APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B activity. Through this approach, we demonstrate that APOBEC3A an APOBEC3B deaminase activity is strongly regulated by specific sequences surrounding the targeted cytosine. Moreover, we identify structural features of APOBEC3B and APOBEC3A responsible for their substrate preferences. Importantly, we determine that APOBEC3B-induced mutations in hairpin-forming sequences within tumor genomes differ from the DNA stem-loop sequences mutated by APOBEC3A. Together, our study provides evidence that APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B can generate mutation landscapes in cancer genomes, driven by their unique substrate selectivity.",

Inspired by polymer physics models, our analysis centers around distance distributions between different tags, aiming to unravel the chromatin conformational arrangements. We show that for any specific genomic site, there are (at least) two different conformational arrangements of chromatin, implying coexisting distinct topologies which we refer to as phase  and phase {beta}. These two phases show different scaling behaviors: the former is consistent with a crumpled globule while the latter indicates a confined, but more extended conformation, as a looped domain.

    "abstract": "The APOBEC3 family of enzymes convert cytosines in single-stranded DNA to uracils thereby causing mutations. These enzymes protect human cells against viruses and retrotransposons, but in many cancers they contribute to mutations that diversify the tumors and help them escape anticancer drug treatments. To understand the mechanism of mutagenesis by APOBEC3B, we expressed the complete enzyme or its catalytic carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) in repair-deficient Eschericia coli and mapped the resulting uracils using uracil pull-down and sequencing technology. The uracilomes of A3B-full and A3B-CTD showed peaks in many of the same regions where APOBEC3A also created uracilation peaks. Like A3A, the two A3B enzymes also preferred to deaminate cytosines near transcription start sites and in the lagging-strand template at replication forks. In contrast to an earlier report that A3B does not favor hairpin loops over linear DNA, we found that both A3B-full and A3B-CTD showed a strong preference for cytosines in hairpin loops. The major difference between A3A and A3B was that while the former enzyme prefers 3 nt loops the best, A3B prefers loops of 4 nt over those of other lengths. Furthermore, within 5 nt loops, A3A prefers cytosine to be in the penultimate position, while A3B prefers it to be at the 3 end of the loop. We confirmed these loop size and sequence preferences experimentally using purified A3A and A3B-CTD proteins. Reanalysis of hairpin loop mutations in human tumors using the size, sequence and position preferences of the two enzymes found that the tumors displayed mutations with intrinsic characteristics of both the enzymes with a stronger contribution from A3A.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria underscores the need to define genetic vulnerabilities that can be therapeutically exploited. The Gram-negative pathogen, Acinetobacter baumannii, is considered an urgent threat due to its propensity to evade antibiotic treatments. Essential cellular processes are the target of existing antibiotics and a likely source of new vulnerabilities. Although A. baumannii essential genes have been identified by transposon sequencing (Tn-seq), they have not been prioritized by sensitivity to knockdown or antibiotics. Here, we take a systems biology approach to comprehensively characterize A. baumannii essential genes using CRISPR interference (CRISPRi). We show that certain essential genes and pathways are acutely sensitive to knockdown, providing a set of vulnerable targets for future therapeutic investigation. Screening our CRISPRi library against last-resort antibiotics uncovered genes and pathways that modulate beta-lactam sensitivity, an unexpected link between NADH dehydrogenase activity and growth inhibition by polymyxins, and anticorrelated phenotypes that underpin synergy between polymyxins and rifamycins. Our study demonstrates the power of systematic genetic approaches to identify vulnerabilities in Gram-negative pathogens and uncovers antibiotic-essential gene interactions that better inform combination therapies.\n\nImportanceAcinetobacter baumannii is a hospital-acquired pathogen that is resistant to many common antibiotic treatments. To combat resistant A. baumannii infections, we need to identify promising therapeutic targets and effective antibiotic combinations. In this study, we comprehensively characterize the genes and pathways that are critical for A. baumannii viability. We show that genes involved in aerobic metabolism are central to A. baumannii physiology and may represent appealing drug targets. We also find antibiotic-gene interactions that may impact the efficacy of carbapenems, rifamycins, and polymyxins, providing a new window into how these antibiotics function in mono- and combination therapies. Our studies offer a useful approach for characterizing interactions between drugs and essential genes in pathogens to inform future therapies.",

We recently demonstrated that TDP-43 binding to endogenous nuclear GU-rich RNAs sequesters TDP-43 in the nucleus and restricts its passive nuclear export. Here, we tested the feasibility of synthetic RNA oligonucleotide-mediated augmentation of TDP-43 nuclear localization. Using biochemical assays, we compared the ability of GU-rich oligonucleotides to engage in multivalent, RRM-dependent binding with TDP-43 and identified (GU)16 as a strong multivalent binder. When transfected into cells, unlike monovalent oligonucleotides that displaced TDP-43 from the nucleus, (GU)16 preserved steady-state TDP-43 nuclear localization and prevented transcriptional blockade-induced TDP-43 mislocalization. RNA pulldowns from (GU)16-transfected cells confirmed that (GU)16 induced high molecular weight RNP complexes, incorporating TDP-43 and possibly other GU-binding proteins. Transfected (GU)16 caused partial failure of TDP-43 cryptic exon repression, likely because the high-affinity oligonucleotides diverted TDP-43 from endogenous RNAs. Thus, while GU-rich oligonucleotides can attenuate TDP-43 mislocalization, optimization is needed to avoid TDP-43 loss of function.",

Coloboma results from fusion failure between opposing ventral retinal epithelia, but there are major knowledge gaps in our understanding of this process at the molecular and cell behavioural levels. Here we catalogue the expression of cell adhesion proteins: N-cadherin, E-cadherin, ZO-1, and the EMT transcriptional activator and cadherin regulator SNAI2. We find that fusion pioneer cells at the edges of the fusing optic fissure have unique and dynamic expression profiles for N-cad, E-cad and ZO-1, and that these are temporally preceded by expression of SNAI2. This highlights the unique properties of these cells and indicates that regulation of cell adhesion factors is a critical process in optic fissure closure.",

    "abstract": "Organisms can adapt to environmental heterogeneity through two mechanisms: (1) constitutive expression of population genetic variation or (2) phenotypic plasticity. We investigated whether patterns of plastic and constitutively expressed traits along elevational and latitudinal clines in a North American endemic plant, Mimulus laciniatus, were consistent with local adaptation. We grew inbred lines of M. laciniatus from across the species range to measure constitutive and plastic trait expression in several traits previously shown to be involved in adaptation to M. laciniatuss rocky outcrop microhabitat: flowering time, size-related traits, and leaf shape. We then tested for a relationship between variation in trait expression and population elevation and latitude, and examined correlation in trait expression between plastic and constitutive traits. We found that population variation in constitutive leaf lobing is associated with latitude, and identified multiple traits that show patterns consistent with local adaptation to elevation: critical photoperiod, flowering time, flower size, leaf lobing, and leaf lobing plasticity. These trends occur along multiple geographically independent altitudinal clines indicating that selection is a more likely cause of this pattern than gene flow among nearby populations with similar trait values. We did not find a correlation between constitutive and plastic leaf lobing at the individual genotype level, suggesting that while both traits appear to be adaptive, they operate under independent genetic controls. This indicates that both having more highly lobed leaves and greater leaf shape plasticity are likely adaptive at high elevation within M. laciniatus. Our data strongly suggest that traits known to be under divergent selection between M. laciniatus and close relative Mimulus guttatus are also under locally varying selection within M. laciniatus.",

Here, we report complete genome sequences of the bacterial type strains Terrisporobacter petrolearius JCM 19845T, Terrisporobacter mayombei DSM 6539T and Terrisporobacter glycolicus DSM 1288T. Functional annotation, KEGG pathway module reconstructions and screening for virulence factors were performed. Various species-specific vitamin, cofactor and amino acid auxotrophies were identified and a model for acetogenesis of Terrisporobacter was constructed. The complete genomes harbored a gene cluster for the reductive proline-dependent branch of the Stickland reaction located on an approximately 21 kb plasmid, which is exclusively found in the Terrisporobacter genus. Phylogenomic analysis of available Terrisporobacter genomes suggested a reclassification of most isolates as T. glycolicus into T. petrolearius.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian SID-1 transmembrane family members, SIDT1 and SIDT2, are multi-pass transmembrane proteins that mediate the cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking of nucleic acids, playing important roles in the immune response and tumorigenesis. Previous work has suggested that human SIDT1 and SIDT2 are N-glycosylated, but the precise site-specific N-glycosylation information and its functional contribution remain unclear. In this study, we employ high-resolution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to comprehensively map the N-glycosites and quantify the N-glycosylation profiles of SIDT1 and SIDT2. Our results provide crucial information about the functional impact of N-glycosylation on SIDT1. In particular, removal of the N-glycosylation from SIDT1 results in a severe defect in RNA uptake. Further molecular mechanistic probing elucidates the essential role of N-linked glycans in regulating RNA binding, cell surface expression and protein stability of SIDT1. Our results reveal a potential functional role for N-glycosylation in the regulation of SIDT1-mediated RNA uptake and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of this promising nucleic acid delivery system, with potential implications for therapeutic applications.",

    "abstract": "One-carbon metabolism drives an extensive network of signalling and biosynthetic pathways essential for cell growth and redox regulation. In all domains of life, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) signals the commitment of folate-derived one-carbon units into biosynthesis of the global donor of trans-methylation, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM). Eukaryotic MTHFR appends to its conserved TIM-barrel catalytic domain (CD) a unique regulatory domain (RD) that confers feedback inhibition by SAM. We determined, through cryo-electron microscopy, multiple structures of human MTHFR bound to SAM, and its demethylated product S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) that relieves SAM inhibition. In the active SAH-bound state, the CD is flexible and its active site accessible for catalysis. SAM binding in the inhibited state substantially rearranges the inter-domain linker, which: remodels the RD pocket, reorients the CD, inserts a loop from the linker into the CD blocking active site access, and mobilizes Tyr404 to lock onto the flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor. The switch between the active and inhibited states is facilitated by binding of either one SAH or two SAM molecules to the RD, respectively. Occupation of both SAM sites is required for inhibition, but the second site is occluded in the presence of SAH. Together our data explain the long-distance inhibitory mechanism of MTHFR employed by dual SAM binding, demonstrate how a single bound SAH confers a dis-inhibitory signal, and pave the way for rational design of novel therapeutics targeting MTHFR.",

However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined.\n\nHere, we explored a novel hypothesis for A{beta}42 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for {gamma}-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported increases in A{beta}42, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on {gamma}-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events.\n\nWe show that human A{beta}42 peptides, but neither murine A{beta}42 nor human A{beta}17-42 (p3), inhibit {gamma}-secretases and trigger accumulation of unprocessed substrates in neurons, including C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP, p75 and pan-cadherin. Moreover, A{beta}42 treatment dysregulated cellular homeostasis, as shown by the induction of p75-dependent neuronal death in two distinct cellular systems.\n\nOur findings raise the possibility that pathological elevations in A{beta}42 contribute to cellular toxicity via the {gamma}-secretase inhibition, and provide a novel conceptual framework to address A{beta} toxicity in the context of {gamma}-secretase-dependent homeostatic signaling.",

    "abstract": "A recent study demonstrated a substantial signal increase when employing a 0.5% acetic acid buffer additive instead of the traditional 0.1% formic acid used in shotgun proteomics. In this study I compare these two buffers for a dilution series of tryptic digests down to 20 picograms peptide on column on a TIMSTOF single cell proteome (SCP) system. I observe a comparable relative level of signal increase as previously reported, which translates to improvements in proteome coverage at every peptide load assessed. The relative increase in peptide identifications is more apparent at lower concentrations with a striking 1.8-fold more peptides identified at 20 pg peptide load, resulting in over 2,000 protein groups identified in 30 minutes on this system. These results translate well to isolated single human cancer cells allowing over 1,000 protein groups to be identified in single human cells processed using a simple one step method in standard 96-well plates.\n\nAll vendor raw and processed data has been made publicly available at www.massive.ucsd.edu and can be accessed as MSV000092563.\n\nAbstract graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=87 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/551522v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (38K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@df969aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@118611dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18fdb62org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18c07ef_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

The highly dynamic nature of chains of unpaired nucleobases challenges structural characterizations of ssRNA by experiments or molecular dynamics (MD) simulations alike. Here we use hierarchical chain growth (HCG) to construct ensembles of ssRNA chains. HCG assembles the structures of protein and nucleic acid chains from fragment libraries created by MD simulations. Applied to homo- and heteropolymeric ssRNAs of different lengths, we find that HCG produces structural ensembles that overall are in good agreement with diverse experiments including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET). The agreement can be further improved by ensemble refinement using Bayesian inference of ensembles (BioEn). HCG can be used to assemble RNA structures that combine paired and unpaired regions.",

    "abstract": "The Calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G protein-coupled receptor activated by fluctuations in extracellular calcium concentrations. Its importance in calcium homeostasis has long been established, though its role in other tissues is not well understood. Obesity is a major epidemic with both clinical and social consequences, therefore, understanding the full function and regulation of adipocytes is of critical importance. Adipocyte CaSR has previously been linked to lipolysis and inflammation in vitro. In this study, we set out to further our understanding of adipocyte CaSR in vivo via the generation of an adipocyte specific CaSR knockout mouse (CaSRAd-/-). We found female CaSRAd-/- mice weighed less than wildtype littermates with a significant reduction in visceral adipocyte size potentially due to increased expression of brown fat markers UCP-1 and Cidea. We also established that CaSR is expressed in perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) and that its deletion protects female mice from PVAT driven hypercontractility. In contrast CaSR deletion had no effect on male body mass, adipocyte size or vascular reactivity. In conclusion, CaSR seems to be of importance in female but not male visceral and perivascular adipose tissue.",
