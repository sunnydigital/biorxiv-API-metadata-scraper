    "abstract": "It has been recognized that well-connected networks of protected areas are needed to halt the continued loss of global biodiversity. The recently signed Kunming-Montreal biodiversity agreement commits countries to protecting 30% of terrestrial lands in well-connected networks of protected areas by 2030. To meet these ambitious targets, land-use planners and conservation practitioners will require tools to identify areas important for connectivity and track future changes. In this study we present methods using circuit theoretic models with a subset of sentinel park nodes to evaluate connectivity for a protected areas network. We assigned a lower cost to natural areas within protected areas, under the assumption that animal movement within parks should be less costly given the regulation of activities. We found that by using mean pairwise effective resistance (MPER) as an indicator of overall network connectivity, we were able to detect changes in a parks network in response to simulated land-use changes. As expected, MPER increased with the addition of high-cost developments and decreased with the addition of new, low-cost protected areas. We tested our sentinel node method by evaluating connectivity for the protected areas network in the province of Ontario, Canada. Our method can help provide protected areas ecologists and planners with baseline estimates of connectivity for a given protected areas network and an indicator that can be used to track changes in connectivity in the future.",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) pollution is a major threat to ecosystems and a driver of climate change through emissions of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). Mining activities are increasingly recognized for contributing to N pollution due to undetonated, N-based explosives. A woodchip denitrifying bioreactor, installed to treat nitrate-rich leachate from waste rock dumps in northern Sweden, was monitored for two years to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of microbial communities in pore water and woodchips and their genetic potential for different N transformation processes, and how this affected the N removal capacity and possible production of undesired N species, like ammonium, nitrite and N2O. About 80 and 65 % of the nitrate was removed from the leachate the first and second operational year, respectively, which agreed with a decrease in dissolved organic carbon in the outlet water. There was a succession in the microbial community over time and in space along the reactor length in both pore water and woodchips, which was reflected in the genetic potential for N cycling and ultimately also reactor performance. We conclude that DNRA had minimal impact on the overall N removal efficiency due to the low relative abundance of the key gene nrfA involved in DNRA and the low production of ammonium. However, nitrite, ammonium, and N2O were formed in the bioreactor and released in the effluent water, although direct emissions of N2O from the surface was low. The N2O production in the reactor might be explained by the ratio between the genetic potential for overall denitrification and N2O reduction in the woodchip and pore water communities, as indicated by the low ratio between the abundance of nir and nosZ genes. Altogether, the results indicate that the denitrification pathway was temporally as well as spatially separated along the reactor length, and that unwanted reactive N species were produced at different time points and locations in the reactor. Thus, the succession of microbial communities in woodchip denitrifying bioreactors treating mining impacted water develops slowly at low temperature, which impacts the reactor performance.",

    "abstract": "Although a broad range of methods exists for reconstructing population history from genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data, just a few methods gained popularity in archaeogenetics: principal component analysis (PCA); ADMIXTURE, an algorithm that models individuals as mixtures of multiple ancestral sources represented by actual or inferred populations; formal tests for admixture such as f3-statistics and D-statistics; and qpAdm, a tool for fitting two-component and more complex admixture models to groups or individuals. Despite their popularity in archaeogenetics, which is explained by modest computational requirements and ability to analyse data of various types and qualities, protocols relying on qpAdm that screen numerous alternative models of varying complexity and find \"fitting\" models (often considering both estimated admixture proportions and p-values as a composite criterion of model fit) remain untested on complex simulated population histories in the form of admixture graphs of random topology. We analysed genotype data extracted from such simulations and tested various types of high-throughput qpAdm protocols (\"rotating\" and \"non-rotating\", with or without temporal stratification of target groups and proxy ancestry sources, with or without a \"model competition\" step). We caution that these qpAdm protocols may be inappropriate for exploratory analyses in poorly studied regions/periods since their false discovery rates varied between 12% and 68% depending on the details of the protocol and on the amount and quality of simulated data (i.e., >12% of fitting two-way admixture models imply gene flows that were not simulated), although our study has a number of limitations. We demonstrate that for reducing false discovery rates of qpAdm protocols to nearly 0% it is advisable to use large SNP sets with low missing data rates, the rotating qpAdm protocol with a strictly enforced rule that target groups do not pre-date their proxy sources, and an unsupervised ADMIXTURE analysis as a way to verify feasible qpAdm models.",

    "abstract": "Chemical probing technologies enable high-throughput examination of diverse structural features of RNA including local nucleotide flexibility, RNA secondary structure, protein- and ligand-binding, through-space interaction networks, and multi-state structural ensembles. These layers of RNA structural information are often most incisive for understanding RNA structure-function relationships when combined with each other and when evaluated under structure- and function-altering conditions. Analysis of these complex data has required, often time consuming and awkward, juggling of multiple intermediate data files and software to create visualizations that support RNA-centered hypotheses. Here, we present the RNA visualization and graphical analysis toolset RNAvigate, developed as an easy-to-use and flexible Python library. RNAvigate currently integrates seven chemical probing data formats, nine secondary and tertiary structure formats, and eleven plot types. These features enable efficient exploration of nuanced relationships between chemical probing data, RNA structures, and motif annotations across multiple experimental samples. Modularity supports integration of new data types and plotting features. Compatibility with Jupyter Notebooks facilitates reproducibility and organization of multistep analyses and makes RNAvigate an ideal, time-effective, and non-burdensome platform for sharing full analysis pipelines. RNAvigate streamlines implementation of chemical probing strategies and accelerates discovery and characterization of diverse RNA-centric functions in biology.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThe performances of popular Genome-wide association study (GWAS) models havent been examined yet in a consistent manner under the scenario of genetic admixture, which introduces several challenging aspects such as heterogeneity of minor allele frequency (MAF), a wide spectrum of case-control ratio, and varying effect sizes etc.\n\nMethodsWe generated a cohort of synthetic individuals (N=19,234) that simulates 1) a large sample size; 2) two-way admixture [Native American-European ancestry] and 3) a binary phenotype. We then examined the inflation factors produced by three popular GWAS tools: GMMAT, SAIGE, and Tractor. We also computed power calculations under different MAFs, case-control ratios, and varying ancestry percentages. Then, we employed a cohort of Peruvians (N=249) to further examine the performances of the testing models on 1) real genetic data and 2) small sample sizes. Finally, we validated these findings using an independent Peruvian cohort (N=109) included in 1000 Genome project (1000G).\n\nResultIn the synthetic cohort, SAIGE performed better than GMMAT and Tractor in terms of type-I error rate, especially under severe unbalanced case-control ratio. On the contrary, power analysis identified Tractor as the best method to pinpoint ancestry-specific causal variants, but showed decreased power when no adequate heterogeneity of the true effect sizes was simulated between ancestries. The real Peruvian data showed that Tractor is severely affected by small sample sizes, and produced severely inflated statistics, which we replicated in the 1000G Peruvian cohort.\n\nDiscussionThe current study illustrates the limitations of available GWAS tools under different scenarios of genetic admixture. We urge caution when interpreting results under complex population scenarios.",

    "abstract": "RNA sequencing (RNAseq) technology has become increasingly important in precision medicine and clinical diagnostics and emerged as a powerful tool for identifying protein-coding genes, performing differential gene analysis, and inferring immune cell composition. Human peripheral blood samples are widely used for RNAseq, providing valuable insights into individual biomolecular information. Blood samples can be classified as whole blood (WB), plasma, serum, and remaining sediment samples, including plasma-free blood (PFB) and serum-free blood (SFB) samples. However, the feasibility of using PFB and SFB samples for transcriptome analysis remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to assess the viability of employing PFB or SFB samples as substitute RNA sources in transcriptomic analysis and performed a comparative analysis of WB, PFB, and SFB samples for different applications. Our results revealed that PFB samples exhibit greater similarity to WB samples in terms of protein-coding gene expression patterns, differential expression gene profiling, and immunological characterizations, suggesting that PFB can be a viable alternative for transcriptomic analysis.

    "abstract": "PurposeSchlemms canal (SC) is a critical structure regulating aqueous humor (AH) drainage and intraocular pressure (IOP). It is known that in the conventional outflow pathway, AH flows from SC to episcleral veins. We recently reported a high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) imaging technology for intact eyeballs, SC and ocular surface. Using this advanced technology, we herein report the discovery of a new structure, termed lymphatic bridge, that directly connects SC to the limbal and conjunctival lymphatic pathway. Further investigation on this novel outflow pathway may provide new mechanisms and therapeutic approaches for glaucoma.\n\nMethodsAs reported previously, intact eyeballs were harvested from Prox-1-GFP (green fluorescent protein) mice and processed by a tissue clearing technique with CLARITY. Samples were immunolabeled with specific antibodies for CD31 (pan-endothelial marker) and LYVE-1 (lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor-1) and imaged by light-sheet fluorescent microscopy. The limbal areas were examined to locate connecting channels between SC and limbal and conjunctival lymphatic vessels. Moreover, in vivo anterior chamber dye injection was performed with Texas Red dextran for functional analysis on AH outflow.\n\nResultsA novel lymphatic bridge structure that expressed both Prox-1 and LYVE-1 was discovered between the SC and limbal lymphatic vessels connected with conjunctival lymphatic pathway. Results from the anterior chamber dye injection showed AH drainage into the conjunctival lymphatic outflow pathway.\n\nConclusionsThis study provides the first evidence on the direct connection between SC and limbal and conjunctival lymphatic pathway. This new pathway is distinctive from the conventional episcleral vein pathway and merits further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in the analysis of high-density surface electromyography (HDsEMG) have enabled the identification, and tracking, of motor units (MUs) to study muscle activation. This study aimed to evaluate the reliability of MU tracking using two common methods: blind source separation filters and two-dimensional waveform cross-correlation. An experiment design was developed to assess physiological reliability, and reliability for a drug intervention known to reduce the firing rate of motoneurones (cyproheptadine). HDsEMG signals were recorded from tibialis anterior during isometric dorsiflexions to 10%, 30%, 50% and 70% of maximal voluntary contraction. MUs were matched within session (2 hr) using the filter method, and between sessions (7 days) via the waveform method. Both tracking methods demonstrated similar reliability during physiological conditions (e.g., MU discharge: filter ICC 10% of MVC = 0.76, to 70% of MVC = 0.86; waveform ICC: 10% of MVC = 0.78, to 70% of MVC = 0.91). Although reliability slightly reduced after the pharmacological intervention, there were no discernible differences in tracking performance (e.g., MU disc filter ICC: 10% of MVC = 0.73, to 70% of MVC = 0.75; DR waveform ICC: 10% of MVC = 0.84, to 70% of MVC = 0.85). The poorest reliability typically occurred at higher contraction intensities, which aligned with the greatest variability in MU characteristics. This study confirms that tracking method may not impact the interpretation of MU data, provided that an appropriate experiment design is employed. However, caution should be used when tracking MUs during higher intensity isometric contractions.\n\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYThe most direct way to validate longitudinal tracking of motor unit data extracted from high-density surface electromyography is to contrast findings with intramuscular electromyography. We use pharmacology to changes motor unit discharge properties as a non-invasive alternative to validate the reliability tracking motor units. This study confirmed that the specific tracking method may not impact interpretation of motor unit data at lower contraction intensities, however caution should be used when tracking units during higher intensities.",

However, there is no information available on elementary school students attitudes toward intraspecific diversity conservation nor is there a framework available to perform such analysis. For this study we designed, implemented, and evaluated an educational activity planned for third graders (8 to 13 years old) to explore the intraspecific diversity of vegetables and to promote healthy eating habits. Additionally, a framework was developed to evaluate students attitudes towards intraspecific diversity conservation and applied to semi-structured interviews conducted with students before and after engaging in the educational activity. In this paper we present a reliable framework, developed aligned with the ABC model of attitudes, based on literature, and adapted to elementary school students responses, to evaluate students attitudes toward intraspecific diversity. Our results show that, before the educational activity, most students choose a non-biodiverse option, justifying this choice with the affective component of attitudes: mostly emotional factors but also aesthetic and social/cultural factors. After the educational activity, we observed a significant increase in the frequency of students that choose the biodiverse option and that justified it with the cognitive component of attitudes: mainly with biology and health knowledge factors, but also with economic and ethical knowledge factors. Our findings support the positive impact of educational activities that explore vegetable varieties on students attitudes toward intraspecific diversity conservation.",

In the present analysis, we parameterized our previously published QSP model of the cancer-immunity cycle to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and generated a virtual patient cohort to predict clinical response to PD-L1 inhibition in NSCLC. The virtual patient generation was guided by immunogenomic data from iAtlas portal and population pharmacokinetic data of durvalumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor. With virtual patients generated following the immunogenomic data distribution, our model predicted a response rate of 18.6% (95% bootstrap confidence interval: 13.3-24.2%) and identified CD8/Treg ratio as a potential predictive biomarker in addition to PD-L1 expression and tumor mutational burden.

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is an increasing threat to an aging society. The idiopathic form of PD accounts for over 90% of all cases, and the current etiology is still unknown. One of the reasons hindering research on this form of PD is the lack of an appropriate animal models. Among mouse models of the disease, those based on the administration of neurotoxins such as 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) or 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) or striatum are predominantly used. In these models, there are metabolic disturbances causing oxidative stress in the SNpc or striatum, which ultimately leads to the death of dopaminergic neurons. However, the models used so far have serious limitations, most of all they do not fully reflect the processes occurring in the course of the disease and do not consider the involvement of inflammation in the etiology and pathogenesis of PD. In this study we show that the administration of synthetic neuromelanin, which activates astrocytes and microglia, induces the inflammation and may be involved in degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Neuromelanin under physiological conditions acts as a neuroprotector, however, released from dying dopaminergic neurons is an important factor activating astrocytes, microglia and causing neuroinflammation. Since one of the causes of Parkinsons appear to be the death of dopaminergic neurons overloaded with neuromelanin and consequent pathological activation of microglia, the use of synthetic neuromelanin reflect the natural pathological processes occurring during the development of the disease.",

    "abstract": "The topological organization of brain networks, or connectomes, can be quantified using graph theory. Here, we investigated brain networks in higher dimensional spaces defined by up to ten node-level graph theoretical invariants. Nodal invariants are intrinsic nodal properties which reflect the topological characteristics of the nodes with respect to the whole network, including segregation (e.g., clustering coefficient) and centrality (e.g., betweenness centrality) measures. Using 100 healthy unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project, we generated multiple types of connectomes (structural/functional networks and binary/weighted networks) and embedded the corresponding network nodes (brain regions) into multidimensional graph spaces defined by the invariants. First, we observed that nodal invariants are correlated between them (i.e., they carry similar network information) at a whole-brain and subnetwork level. Second, we conducted a machine learning analysis to test whether brain regions embedded in multidimensional graph spaces can be accurately classified into higher order (association, subcortical and cerebellar) and lower order (visual, somatomotor, attention) areas. Brain regions of higher order and lower order brain circuits were classified with an 80-87% accuracy in a 10-dimensional (10D) space. 10D graph metrics performed better than 2D and 3D graph metrics, and non-linear Gaussian kernels performed better than linear kernels. This suggests a non-linear brain network information gain in a high-dimensional graph space. Finally, we quantified the inter-subject Euclidean distance of each brain region embedded in the multidimensional graph space. The inter-individual distance was largest for regions of the default mode and frontoparietal networks, providing a new avenue for subject-specific network coordinates in a multidimensional space. To conclude, we propose a new framework for quantifying connectome features in multidimensional spaces defined by graph invariants, providing a new avenue for subject-specific network coordinates and inter-individual distance analyses.",

    "abstract": "C. trachomatis is a developmentally regulated, obligate intracellular bacterium that encodes three sigma factors: {sigma}66, {sigma}54, and {sigma}28. {sigma}66 is the major sigma factor controlling most transcription initiation during early and mid-cycle development as the infectious EB transitions to the non-infectious RB that replicates within an inclusion inside the cell. The roles of the minor sigma factors, {sigma}54 and {sigma}28, have not been well characterized to date - however, there are data to suggest each functions in late-stage development and secondary differentiation as RBs transition to EBs. As the process of secondary differentiation itself is poorly characterized, clarifying the function of these alternative sigma factors by identifying the genes regulated by them will further our understanding of chlamydial differentiation. We hypothesize that {sigma}54 and {sigma}28 have non-redundant and essential functions for initiating late gene transcription thus mediating secondary differentiation in Chlamydia. Here, we demonstrate the necessity of each minor sigma factor in successfully completing the developmental cycle. We have implemented and validated multiplexed CRISPRi techniques novel to the chlamydial field to examine effects of knocking down each alternative sigma factor individually and simultaneously. In parallel, we also overexpressed each sigma factor. Altering transcript levels for either or both alternative sigma factors resulted in a severe defect in EB production as compared to controls. Furthermore, RNA sequencing identified differentially expressed genes during alternative sigma factor dysregulation, indicating the putative regulons of each. These data demonstrate the levels of alternative sigma factors must be carefully regulated to facilitate chlamydial growth and differentiation.\n\nImportanceChlamydia trachomatis is a significant human pathogen in both developed and developing nations. Due to the organisms unique developmental cycle and intracellular niche, basic research has been slow and arduous. However, recent advances in chlamydial genetics have allowed the field to make significant progress in experimentally interrogating the basic physiology of Chlamydia. Broadly speaking, the driving factors of chlamydial development are poorly understood, particularly regarding how the later stages of development are regulated. Here, we employ a novel genetic tool for use in Chlamydia while investigating the effects of dysregulating the two alternative sigma factors in the organism that help control transcription initiation. We provide further evidence for both sigma factors essential roles in late-stage development and their potential regulons, laying the foundation for deeper experimentation to uncover the molecular pathways involved in chlamydial differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus colonizes 30% of the human population, but only a few clones cause severe infections. S. aureus virulence varies and partly depends on the presence of prophages, viral DNA embedded in the S. aureus core genome, such as hlb-converting prophage ({phi}Sa3int). Human-adapted S. aureus often harbours a {phi}Sa3int group of prophages preferentially integrated into their {beta}-hemolysin (hlb) gene that encodes human immune evasion cluster (IEC) genes. Exotoxins and immune modulatory molecules encoded by this prophage can inhibit human innate immunity increasing S. aureus pathogenicity. This study aims to investigate the genomic and phenotypic plasticity of S. aureus and changes in its extracellular proteome after the acquisition of {phi}Sa3int prophage.\n\nTo achieve this, we used S. aureus strains isolated from the sinus cavities of a patient with severe chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) at two different time points (S. aureus SA222 and S. aureus SA333) and hybrid sequenced the strains using short-read Illumina and long-read Oxford nanopore technology. In silico analysis showed the presence of a {phi}Sa3int prophage in the later isolate but not in the earlier isolate while most of the core genes remained identical. Using mitomycin C, we induced the {phi}Sa3int prophage, and transduced it into the Sa3int-prophage-free SA222 isolate to obtain a laboratory generated  double lysogen. We confirmed the successful lysogenisation with culture methods (spot assay, blood agar) and also by sequencing. We compared growth kinetics, biofilm biomass and metabolic activity between parent and the lysogen by establishing growth curves, crystal violet and resazurin assays. Exoproteins were identified and quantified using mass spectrophotometry.\n\nIntegration of {phi}Sa3int prophage in SA222 down-regulated the beta-hemolysin expression of the lysogen. In silico analysis of the S. aureus genome confirmed the insertion of a [~]43.8 kb {phi}Sa3int prophage into hlb gene. Insertion of prophage DNA did not alter the growth kinetics, biofilm formation, adhesion to primary human nasal epithelial cells and the metabolic activity in a biofilm. However, the acquisition of {phi}Sa3int prophage significantly changed the expression of various secreted proteins, both bacterial and prophage-encoded. Altogether, thirty-eight exoproteins were significantly differentially regulated in the laboratory created lysogen, compared to its recipient strain SA222. Among these proteins, there was significant upregulation of 21 exoproteins (55.3 %) including staphylokinase (sak), SCIN (scn), and intercellular adhesion protein B (icaB) and downregulation of 17 exoproteins (44.7 %), including {beta}-hemolysin (hlb/sph) and outer membrane porin (phoE). Most of the upregulated proteins were involved in immunomodulation that help S. aureus escape human innate immunity and help cause chronic infection. These findings may contribute to the development of novel approaches to render S. aureus susceptible to the immune response by blocking prophage-associated defence mechanisms.\n\nHighlightsO_LIA {phi}Sa3int prophage preferentially integrates into the {beta}-haemolysin gene (hlb) gene thereby disrupting the beta-hemolysin function.\nC_LIO_LIA [~]43.8 kb {phi}Sa3int prophage acquisition by S. aureus has no impact on its growth kinetics, biofilm formation and adhesion to primary human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs).\nC_LIO_LIThe presence of a {phi}Sa3int group prophage likely enhances Staphylococcus aureus human immune evasion capability as the prophage encodes a complete set of immune evasion cluster (IEC) genes.\nC_LIO_LITargeted identification of virulence factors in addition to species and strain identification may lead to better-personalized therapy as not all S. aureus carry the same virulence genes.\nC_LI",

Here, we present the generation of a novel cellular biosensor panel for the recognition of fungal pathogen-related VOCs we had identified in the field as well as during controlled inoculations of several crop plants. The panel consists of seven stable HEK293 cell lines each expressing a functional Drosophila olfactory receptor as a biosensing element and a genetically encoded fluorescent calcium indicator protein. For high-throughput measurement of odorant binding by the cells, fluorescence response was detected in an automated 384-well microplate reader upon the injection of tester VOCs. Biosensor cell lines were characterized for their reference ligand binding in more detail, then a set of 66 VOCs was profiled on all cell lines over a concentration range of three orders of magnitude (1 M to 100 M). Forty-six VOCs (70%) evoked a response in at least one biosensor cell line and certain VOCs could activate the cell lines already from the nanomolar (ppb) concentration. Interaction profiles mapped in this study will support biosensor development for agricultural applications, but the olfactory receptor proteins may also be purified from these cell lines at sufficient yields for further processing including structure determination or coupling with artificial sensor devices.",

    "abstract": "Meiotic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) initiate homologous recombination and are crucial for ensuring proper chromosome segregation. In mice, ANKRD31 recently emerged as a regulator of DSB timing, number, and location, with a particularly important role in targeting DSBs to the pseudoautosomal regions (PARs) of sex chromosomes. ANKRD31 interacts with multiple proteins, including the conserved and essential DSB-promoting factor REC114, so it was hypothesized to be a modular scaffold that \"anchors\" other proteins together and to meiotic chromosomes. To determine if and why the REC114 interaction is important for ANKRD31 function, we generated mice with Ankrd31 mutations that either reduced (missense mutation) or eliminated (C-terminal truncation) the ANKRD31- REC114 interaction without diminishing contacts with other known partners. A complete lack of the ANKRD31-REC114 interaction mimicked an Ankrd31 null, with delayed DSB formation and recombination, defects in DSB repair, and altered DSB locations including failure to target DSBs to the PARs. In contrast, when the ANKRD31- REC114 interaction was substantially but not completely disrupted, spermatocytes again showed delayed DSB formation globally, but recombination and repair were hardly affected and DSB locations were similar to control mice. The missense Ankrd31 allele showed a dosage effect, wherein combining it with the null or C-terminal truncation allele resulted in intermediate phenotypes for DSB formation, recombination, and DSB locations. Our results show that ANKRD31 function is critically dependent on its interaction with REC114, and that defects in ANKRD31 activity correlate with the severity of the disruption of the interaction.\n\nSignificanceHomologous recombination initiated by double-strand breaks (DSBs) during meiosis is a nearly universal feature of eukaryotic lifecycles, but is also dangerous because DSBs are potentially toxic or mutagenic. The vertebrate-specific protein ANKRD31 is an important regulator of DSB formation, proposed to be a scaffold protein that coordinates the activities of multiple DSB-promoting factors, including the widely conserved REC114. We test this hypothesis here through generation of targeted Ankrd31 mutations that specifically attenuate or eliminate the ANKRD31-REC114 interaction. Analysis of this allelic series demonstrates that the ANKRD31-REC114 interaction is essential for all ANKRD31 activities in vivo, providing insight into how ANKRD31 controls DSB locations, timing, and number.",

As bivalent genes, defined as genes bearing both activating (H3K4me3) and repressive (H3K27me3) chromatin modifications, have been shown to play an important role in development and cancer, we investigated the potential role of bivalent genes in maintaining a de-differentiated state in neuroblastoma and their potential use as a biomarker. We identified 313 genes that bore bivalent chromatin marks, were enriched for mediators of neuronal differentiation, and were transcriptionally repressed across a panel of heterogenous neuroblastoma cell lines. Through gene set variance analysis, we developed a clinically implementable bivalent signature. In three distinct clinical cohorts, low bivalent signature was significantly and independently associated with worse clinical outcome in high-risk neuroblastoma patients. Thus, low expression of bivalent genes is a biomarker of ultra-high-risk disease and may represent a therapeutic opportunity in neuroblastoma.",

Here we show that, upon binding to BRCA2, HSF2BP assembles into a large ring-shaped 24-mer consisting of three interlocked octameric rings. Addition of BRME1 leads to dissociation of this ring structure, and cancels the disruptive effect of HSF2BP on cancer cell resistance to DNA damage. It also prevents BRCA2 degradation during inter-strand DNA crosslink repair in Xenopus egg extracts. We propose that the control of HSF2BP-BRCA2 oligomerization by BRME1 ensures timely assembly of the ring complex that concentrates BRCA2 and controls its turnover, thus promoting meiotic HR.",

Cottonseed can also serve as an excellent source of edible protein and oil. However,the presence of gossypol in pigment gland has limited it utilization In the past few decades, some progress has been made in the understanding molecular mechanism of the formation of the pigment gland. However, little is known about the specific mechanism of pigment gland formation in cotton. In this study, the cDNA sequence of a ethylene transcription factor gene, designated GhERF105a, was cloned from upland cotton CCRI12. Sequence alignment revealed that GhERF105a gene contained a typical AP2/ERF domain of 61 amino acids, and belonged to the ERF subgroup of the ERF supfamily. It was highly expressed in the leaves and stems of glanded plants but had substantially lower expression of the glandless plants. GhERF105a, localized to the nucleus, could bind to GCC-box and DRE. Some development, phytohormone and stress related cis-elements were enriched in the promoters of GhERF105a/d. Split ubiquitin assays in yeast and BiFC experiments showed extensive interactions between GhERF105a and Gh_A07G1044. In addition, GhERF105a was highly similar with GhERF105d in the gene length, molecular weight, protein molecule, gene structure and expression pattern. The overall results suggested that GhERF105a might participate in the pigment gland formation and stree-response processes.",

There are many factors that could influence the severity of muscle injuries, including strain and strain rate. This study evaluated the interaction of these two factors on the biomechanical properties of the muscle-tendon bundle and their role in injuries. A Hopkinson bar system, an MTS machine and an electrical pulse generator were utilized to collect eccentric contraction response data of over 150 frog muscle-tendon samples at strain rates ranging from 0.01 to 300 s-1. The results have shown that the maximum stress has increased and peaked at about 150 s-1. That peak value has then maintained at the following strain rates. While Youngs modulus of stimulated samples reduced as the strain rate changed from 50 to 300 s-1. That trend was in contrast to unstimulated muscle bundles. In addition, strain rate has significantly influenced tendon-muscle bundle fracture. Samples tend to rupture at a minor strain of about 3.5 % with strain rates over 200 s-1. Because of the increasing stiffness of the muscle area at high strain rates, increased strain in the tendon region resulted in frequent injuries in the tendon area. On the other hand, a maximum-stress reduction was detected when the muscle bundles were stimulated at muscle strain greater than 0.2. The results showed that improper timing of stimulation could increase muscle injury.",

    "abstract": "A molten globule (MG) state is an intermediate state of protein observed during the unfolding of the native structure. In MG states, milk protein -Lactalbumin (aLA) binds to oleic acid (OLA). This MG-aLA-OLA complex, popularly known as XAM-LET performs cytotoxic activities against cancer cell lines. However, the microscopic understanding of ligand recognition ability in MG state of protein is not yet explored. Motivated by this, we explore binding of bovine aLA with OLA (BAMLET) using all atom molecular dynamics(MD) simulations. We find the binding mode between MG-aLA and OLA using the conformational thermodynamics method. We also estimate the binding free energy using the umbrella sampling (US) method for both MG state and neutral state. We find that the binding free energy obtained from US is comparable with earlier experimental results. We characterize the dihedral fluctuations as the ligand is liberated from the active site of the protein using steered molecular dynamics. The long-live fluctuations occur near the ligand binding site, which eventually transfers towards Ca2+ binding site as the ligand is taken away from the protein.\n\nTOC Graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=111 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/538683v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (23K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e374f7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@142d1aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9d3636org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@152542b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "When models of complicated macromolecular systems are constructed, it is common to inadvertently include either gross steric clashes or entanglements of extended loop regions. Removing these problems with conventional energy minimization or dynamics algorithms can often be difficult. Here I show that one easy alternative is to temporarily add an extra spatial dimension and to displace atoms or molecules along this fourth dimension such that the distances between atoms, when measured in 4D, are no longer considered clashing. Adding in half-harmonic potential functions to mimic walls in this 4th dimension, and then moving these walls toward each other, has the effect of decreasing the space available in the 4th dimension and drives atoms to avoid each other in 3D. I illustrate the method with three examples: two showing how interlocked ring polymers can be easily disentangled from each other in both 2D and 3D, and one showing how ten identical coarse-grained protein models, all placed at the same point in 3D space, can be separated from each other, without distorting their structures, during the course of a single energy minimization. A sample program implementing the method is available that can be easily adapted to other situations.",

Control of the associated barley foliar diseases, spot form and net form net blotch, respectively, relies on three major groups of fungicides, demethylation inhibitors (DMI), succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHI) and quinone outside inhibitors (QoI). However, resistance has been reported for the DMI and SDHI fungicides in Australia. To enhance detection of different resistance levels, phenotyping and genotyping workflows were designed. The phenotyping workflow generated cultures directly from lesions and compared growth on discriminatory doses of tebuconazole (DMI) and fluxapyroxad (SDHI). Genotyping real-time PCR assays were based on alleles associated with sensitivity or resistance to the DMI and SDHI fungicides. These workflows were applied to a net blotch collection from 2019 consisting predominantly of P. teres f. teres from South Australia and P. teres f. maculata from Western Australia. For South Australia the Cyp51A L489-3 and SdhC-R134 alleles, associated with resistance to tebuconazole and fluxapyroxad, respectively, were the most prevalent. These alleles were frequently found in single isolates with dual resistance. This study also reports the first detection of a 134 base pair insertion located at position -66 (PtTi-6) in the Cyp51A promoter of P. teres f. maculata from South Australia. For Western Australia, the PtTi-1 insertion was the most common allele associated with resistance to tebuconazole. These workflows will be valuable for screening P. teres populations for fungicide resistance, and informing appropriate management strategies.",

    "abstract": "Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) is one of the most important crops in the world for its fruit production. Advances in cutting-edge techniques have enabled the development of numerous critical traits related to the quality and quantity of tomatoes. Genetic engineering techniques, such as gene transformation and gene editing, have emerged as powerful tools for generating new plant varieties with superior traits. In this study, we induced parthenocarpic traits in a population of elite tomato (ET) lines. At first, the adaptability of ET lines to genetic transformation was evaluated to identify the best-performing lines by transforming the SlANT1 gene overexpression cassette and then later used to produce the SlIAA9 knockout lines using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. ET5 and ET8 emerged as excellent materials for these techniques and showed higher efficiency. Typical phenotypes of knockout sliaa9 were clearly visible in G0 and G1 plants, in which simple leaves and parthenocarpic fruits were observed. The high efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in developing new tomato varieties with desired traits in a short period was demonstrated by generating T-DNA-free homozygous sliaa9 knockout plants in the G1 generation. Additionally, a simple artificial fertilization method was successfully applied to recover seed production from parthenocarpic plants, securing the use of these varieties as breeding materials.",

    "abstract": "Dysfunction of organelle is closely associated with neurological diseases involving disruption of adult neurogenesis. However, the role of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-related molecules in this process remains largely unexplored. Here we show that Derlin-1, an ER quality controller, maintains adult neurogenesis in a spatiotemporal manner. Deletion of Derlin-1 in the mouse central nervous system induces ectopic localization of newborn neurons and impairs neural stem cells (NSCs) transition from active to quiescent states, resulting in early depletion of hippocampal NSCs. As a result, Derlin-1- deficient mice exhibit phenotypes of increased seizure susceptibility and impaired cognitive function. Reduced expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5b (Stat5b) was found to be responsible for the impairment of adult neurogenesis in Derlin-1-deficient NSCs. Remarkably, the inhibition of histone deacetylase activity ameliorated seizure susceptibility and cognitive dysfunction in Derlin-1-deficient mice by increasing Stat5b expression and restoring abnormal neurogenesis. Overall, our findings demonstrate that Derlin-1, as its characteristic function, plays an essential role in the homeostasis of adult neurogenesis via Stat5b expression, thus regulating seizure susceptibility and cognitive function.",

A mass univariate neural encoding analysis of the latent representations showed that feature-disentangled representations explain increasingly more variance than the alternative representations over the ventral stream. Subsequently, a multivariate neural decoding analysis of the feature-disentangled representations resulted in state-of-the-art spatiotemporal reconstructions of visual perception.

    "abstract": "Aging of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is associated with structural and functional changes that lead to a reduction in regenerative capacity and the development of age-related peripheral neuropathy. Myelin is central to maintaining physiological peripheral nerve function and differences in myelin maintenance, degradation, formation and clearance have been suggested to contribute to age-related PNS changes. Recent proteomic studies have elucidated the complex composition of the total myelin proteome in health and its changes in neuropathy models. However, changes in the myelin proteome of peripheral nerves during aging have not been investigated. Here we show that the proteomes of myelin fractions isolated from young and old nerves show only subtle changes. In particular, we found that the three most abundant peripheral myelin proteins (MPZ, MBP and PRX) do not change in old myelin fractions. We also show a tendency for high-abundance myelin proteins other than these three to be downregulated, with only a small number of ribosome-related proteins significantly downregulated and extracellular matrix proteins such as collagens upregulated. In addition, we illustrate that the peripheral nerve myelin proteome reported in this study is suitable for assessing myelin degradation and renewal during peripheral nerve degeneration and regeneration. Our results suggest that the peripheral nerve myelin proteome is relatively stable and undergoes only subtle changes in composition during mouse aging. We proffer the resultant dataset as a resource and starting point for future studies aimed at investigating peripheral nerve myelin during aging. Said datasets are available in the PRIDE archive under the identifier PXD040719 (aging myelin proteome) and PXD041026 (sciatic nerve injury proteome).",

The inflammatory response, Adipor1 and Adipor2 gene expression, RelA nuclear translocation and the effects of adiponectin in LPS-stimulated or Adipor1 silenced H9C2 cells were studied. Gene ontology analysis using differentially expressed genes revealed an enrichment of immune response pathways in the old mice hearts when compared to young mice hearts. Western blot analysis confirmed the down regulation of several anti-inflammatory proteins and the upregulation of pro-inflammatory proteins including CD68, NF-kB1 and Rel-A, in the old mice hearts. Flow cytometry suggested an infiltration of CD11b+monocytes and CD64+ Ly6C-high macrophages in the old mice hearts compared to younger hearts confirming an increased inflammation in the older hearts. Mechanistically, to understand if the Adiponectin-Adipor1-NFkB axis regulates inflammation in the aging heart, Adipor1 and Adipor2 genes were silenced in H9c2 cardiomyocytes. Immune response genes were elevated in the Adipor1 silenced H9c2 cells but not in Adipor2 silenced cells. Pretreatment with Adiponectin (APN) attenuated the Adipor1 silenced or lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-stimulated expression of inflammatory genes in H9c2 cardiomyocytes. APN also attenuated the nuclear translocation of RelA and induction of immune response genes in Adipor1 silenced or LPS-challenged H9c2 cardiomyocytes.

    "abstract": "An essential process in transmission of the malaria parasite to the Anopheles vector is the conversion of mature gametocytes into gametes within the mosquito gut, where they egress from the red blood cell (RBC). During egress, male gametocytes undergo exflagellation, leading to the formation of eight haploid motile microgametes, while female gametes retain their spherical shape. Gametocyte egress depends on sequential disruption of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane and the host cell membrane. In other life cycle stages of the malaria parasite, phospholipases have been implicated in membrane disruption processes during egress, however their importance for gametocyte egress is relatively unknown. Here, we performed comprehensive functional analyses of six putative phospholipases for their role during development and egress of Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes. We localize two of them, the prodrug activation and resistance esterase (PF3D7_0709700) and the lysophospholipase 1 (PF3D7_1476700), to the parasite plasma membrane. Subsequently, we show that disruption of most of the studied phospholipase genes does neither affect gametocyte development nor egress. The exception is the putative patatin-like phospholipase PF3D7_0924000, whose gene deletion leads to a delay in male gametocyte exflagellation, indicating an important, albeit not essential, role of this enzyme in male gametogenesis.",

Although certain global transcriptional regulators governing hox expression have been identified in the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, their dynamics under different environmental conditions remain unknown. Here, we demonstrated that cyAbrB2, a hox operon repressor, binds to the hox promoter under aerobic conditions. Under microoxic conditions, specific binding of cyAbrB2 on hox promoter diminishes, allowing the alternative sigma factor SigE to access and activate gene expression. We also revealed that cyAbrB2 binds broadly to AT-rich genome regions and represses gene expression from these binding regions, similar to the behavior of nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs). We have shown the differential chromatin conformations around hox region in presence and absence of cyAbrB2. Based on this analogy to NAPs, we propose that cyAbrB2 mediates the hox promoters chromosomal conformation, which becomes more relaxed under microoxic conditions, resulting in fermentative gene expression.",

    "abstract": "African swine fever virus encodes proteins that inhibit apoptosis including one member of the BCL-2 family, A179L. Deletion of the A179L gene from the virulent genotype I isolate Benin 97/1 compared to Benin 97/1 expressing A179L or mock-infected macrophages, resulted in increased Caspase 3 and 7 activity, annexin V binding to surface phosphatidyl serine and DNA fragmentation, measured by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase nick-end labelling. These results confirmed that apoptosis was induced earlier in macrophages infected with the Benin{Delta}A179L virus. Increased cell entry of the A179L gene-deleted virus was indicated at early times since up to double the numbers of cells expressed fluorescent protein from the virus genome. Yields of infectious virus were similar over a single cycle but were significantly lower for the A179L gene-deleted virus over a multi-step growth cycle. Pigs immunised and boosted with the Benin{Delta}A179L virus showed no clinical signs, although a weak cellular response to ASFV was observed showing that the virus had replicated. The immunised pigs were not protected against challenge with the virulent parental virus Benin 97/1 although viremia was lower at 3 days post-challenge compared to the control non-immune pigs. The reduced levels of virus replication in macrophages probably limited induction of a protective immune response. The results show an important role for the A179L protein in virus replication in macrophages and virulence in pigs.\n\nIMPORTANCEAfrican swine fever virus (ASFV) causes a lethal disease of pigs that has spread extensively in Africa, Europe and Asia. The virus codes for more than 150 proteins, many of which help the virus to evade the hosts defences following infection. We investigated the effect of deleting one of these genes, A179L, from the genome of an ASFV isolate that causes death of infected pigs. A179L belongs to the BCL-2 protein family, consisting of members which promote or inhibit apoptosis with A179L belonging to the latter. Deleting the A179L gene reduced ASFV replication and spread between macrophages, its main target cells. This was correlated with an increase in cell death. Pigs infected with the virus with A179L gene deleted did not show signs of disease and no virus replication was detected in blood. A low immune response was generated but the immunised pigs were not protected when challenged with the parental deadly virus. The results show that the A179L gene is important for ASFV to replicate efficiently in cells and in animals.",

Here we report a discovery of new groups of anammox bacteria consisting of two new orders, two new families, and six new genera within the class Candidatus Brocadiia, all from geochemically distinct aquifer systems. Up to 25 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) equipped with the core anammox metabolisms were recovered from 13 metagenomic datasets of aquifers and dominated the anammox bacterial communities in distinct aquifers unexpectedly. The comparatively smaller genome size (< 2.6 Mb) and higher coding density (> 85%) likely confer the survival advantage of them by reducing the energy consumption in cell replication and maintenance to increase the nutrient acquisition efficiency in the typically oligotrophic aquifers.

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial genomes play important roles in studying genome evolution, phylogenetic analyses, and species identification. Amphipods (Class Malacostraca, Order Amphipoda) are one of the most ecologically diverse crustacean groups occurring in a diverse array of aquatic and terrestrial environments globally, from freshwater streams and lakes to groundwater aquifers and the deep sea, but we have a limited understanding of how habitat influences the molecular evolution of mitochondrial energy metabolism. Subterranean amphipods likely experience different evolutionary pressures on energy management compared to surface-dwelling taxa that generally encounter higher levels of predation and energy resources and live in more variable environments. In this study, we compared the mitogenomes, including the 13 protein-coding genes involved in the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway, of surface and subterranean amphipods to uncover potentially different molecular signals of energy metabolism between surface and subterranean environments in this diverse crustacean group. We compared base composition, codon usage, gene order rearrangement, conducted comparative mitogenomic and phylogenomic analyses, and examined evolutionary signals of 35 amphipod mitogenomes representing 13 families, with an emphasis on Crangonyctidae. Mitogenome size, AT content, GC-skew, gene order, uncommon start codons, location of putative control region (CR), length of rrnL and intergenic spacers differed between surface and subterranean amphipods. Among crangonyctid amphipods, the spring-dwelling Crangonyx forbesi exhibited a unique gene order, a long nad5 locus, longer rrnL and rrnS loci, and unconventional start codons. Evidence of directional selection was detected in several protein-encoding genes of the OXPHOS pathway in the mitogenomes of surface amphipods, while a signal of purifying selection was more prominent in subterranean species, which is consistent with the hypothesis that the mitogenome of surface-adapted species has evolved in response to a more energy demanding environment compared to subterranean amphipods. Overall, gene order, locations of non-coding regions, and base-substitution rates points to habitat as an important factor influencing the evolution of amphipod mitogenomes.",

    "abstract": "Male house mice (Mus musculus) produce complex ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), especially during courtship and mating. Playback experiments suggest that female attraction towards recordings of male USVs depends on their social experience, paternal exposure, and estrous stage. We conducted a playback experiment with wild-derived female house mice (M. musculus musculus) and compared their attraction to male USVs versus the same recording without USVs (background noise). We tested whether female attraction to USVs is influenced by the following factors: (1) social housing (two versus one female per cage); (2) neonatal paternal exposure (rearing females with versus without father); and (3) sexual receptivity (pro-estrous and estrous stages versus non-receptive metestrous and diestrous stages). We found that females showed a significant attraction to male USVs but only if females were housed with another female. Individually housed females showed the opposite response. We found no evidence that pre-weaning exposure to a father influenced females preferences, whereas sexual receptivity influenced females attraction to male USVs: non-receptive females showed preferences towards male USVs but receptive females did not. Finally, we found that individually housed females were more likely to be in sexually receptive estrous stages than those housed socially, and that attraction to male USVs was most pronounced amongst non-receptive females that were socially housed. Our findings indicate that the attraction of female mice to male USVs depends upon their social experience and estrous stage, though not paternal exposure. They contribute to the growing number of studies showing that social housing and estrous stage influence the behavior of house mice and we show how such unreported variables can contribute to the replication crisis.",

    "abstract": "The origin of molecular evolution required the replication of short oligonucleotides to form longer polymers. Prebiotically plausible oligonucleotide pools tend to contain more of some nucleotide bases than others. It has been unclear whether this initial bias persists and how it affects replication. To investigate this, we examined the evolution of 12 mer biased short DNA pools during enzymatic templated polymerization. Our analysis using next-generation sequencing from different time points revealed that the initial nucleotide bias of the pool disappeared in the elongated pool after isothermal replication. In contrast, the nucleotide composition at each position in the elongated sequences remained biased and varied with both position and initial bias. Furthermore, we observed the emergence of highly periodic dimer and trimer motifs in the rapidly elongated sequences. This shift in nucleotide composition and the emergence of structure through templated replication could help explain how biased prebiotic pools could undergo molecular evolution and lead to complex functional nucleic acids.",

    "abstract": "An effort is made to explain the salt loading of hypertonicity-treated human red blood cells (RBC) and their post-hypertonic lysis, which occurs upon resuspension to isotonic media. It is recognized that the salt loading is consistent with the regulatory volume increase response - a physiological response applied by cells to adapt to hypertonic conditions. It is therefore hypothesized that salt loading occurs via physiological ion transport pathways, allowing passive dissipative fluxes across the plasma membrane with the preservation of membrane integrity. It is argued that post-hypertonic lysis is essentially a hypotonic lysis occurring already in an isotonic medium due to the excess salt in the cytoplasm. A simplified physiological model accounting for transmembrane ion fluxes was applied to simulate the RBC physiological state to address the problem quantitatively. Instead of assuming the plasma membrane to be impermeable to ions, the dynamic nature of cell physiological state and capacity of cells to perform acute cell volume regulation by increasing passive cation plasma membrane permeability is recognized. It is shown that the RBC plasma membrane contains ion pathways capable of supporting a several-order increase in catio permeability, facilitating overall salt loading. The obtained picture, consistent with general physiology, predicts the experimentally observed RBC behavior. Although treated in theory, evidence supporting the proposed theory is provided, and the high explanatory power of the proposed idea is demonstrated. While focused on human RBCs, this study offers a general mechanism for the osmotic injury of cells exposed to hypertonic solutions - conditions relevant to cell cryopreservation - since many cells possess cell volume regulation mechanisms. Implications of the proposed hypothesis explaining the cryoprotective mechanism of common cryoprotectants are discussed, and additives targeting ion transport pathways are suggested as novel cryoprotectants.",

    "abstract": "Brucella species are Gram-negative intracellular bacterial pathogens that cause the worldwide zoonotic disease brucellosis. Brucella can infect many mammals, including humans and domestic and wild animals. Brucella manipulates various host cellular processes to invade and multiply in professional and non-professional phagocytic cells. However, the host targets and their modulation by Brucella to facilitate the infection process remain obscure. Here, we report that the host Ubiquitin Specific Protease, USP8 negatively regulates the invasion of Brucella into macrophages through the plasma membrane receptor, CXCR4. Brucella suppressed the expression of USP8 at its early stage of infection in the infected macrophages. Subsequent studies revealed that the Brucella effector protein, TIR-domain containing protein from Brucella, TcpB plays a significant role in downregulating the expression of USP8 by targeting the CREB pathway. Treatment of mice with USP8 inhibitor resulted in enhanced survival of B. melitensis, whereas mice treated with CXCR4 or 14-3-3 antagonist showed a diminished bacterial load. Our experimental data demonstrate a novel role of USP8 in the host defence against microbial intrusion and microbial subversion of host defences.",

    "abstract": "The colonization of our stomachs by Helicobacter pylori is believed to predate the oldest splits between extant human populations. We identify a \"Hardy\" ecospecies of H. pylori associated with indigenous groups, isolated from people in Siberia, Canada, and USA. The ecospecies shares the ancestry of \"Ubiquitous\" H. pylori from the same geographical region in most of the genome but has nearly fixed SNP differences in 100 genes, many of which encode outer membrane proteins and previously identified host interaction factors. For these parts of the genome, the ecospecies has a separate, independently evolving gene pool with a distinct evolutionary history. H. acinonychis, found in big cats, and a newly identified primate-associated lineage both belong to the Hardy ecospecies and both represent human to animal host jumps. Most strains from the ecospecies encode an additional iron-dependent urease that is shared by Helicobacter from carnivorous hosts, as well as a tandem duplication of vacA, encoding the vacuolating toxin. We conclude that H. pylori split into two highly distinct ecospecies approximately 300,000 years ago and that both dispersed around the globe with humans. Coexistence has likely been possible because the ecospecies are adapted to different host diets, but the Hardy ecospecies has gone extinct in most parts of the world. Our analysis also pushes back the likely length of the association between H. pylori and humans.",

Animal studies suggest that CME may also influence the health and behaviour in the next generation offspring through CME-driven epigenetic changes in the paternal germ line. The contribution of paternal early life stress on the health of the next generation in humans is not fully elucidated.\n\nMethodsIn this study, we measured paternal CME using the Trauma and Distress Scale (TADS) questionnaire and mapped sperm-borne sncRNAs expression by small RNA sequencing (small RNA-seq) and DNA methylation (DNAme) in spermatozoa by reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS-seq) in males from the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study. The study design was a (nested) case-control study, high-TADS (TADS [&ge;] 39, n = 25 for DNAme and n = 14 for small RNA-seq) and low-TADS (TADS [&le;] 10, n = 30 for DNAme and n = 16 for small RNA-seq)). Groups were compared to identify specific epigenetic signatures associated with TADS levels in the spermatozoa of participants.\n\nResultsCompared to the control group, high CME was associated with altered sperm sncRNA expression and DNAme profiles. Particularly, we identified several tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) and miRNAs with markedly changed levels in males with high CME. DNA methylation analysis identified several genomic regions with differentially methylated CpGs between groups. Notably, we identified two epigenetic marks related to brain development with distinct profiles between CME and controls, the miRNA hsa-mir-34c-5p and differential methylation of the region in proximity of FSCN1.\n\nConclusionsThis study provides further evidence that early life stress influences the paternal germ line epigenome and supports a possible contribution in the development of the central nervous system of the next generation.",

One aspect of the inhibitory mechanism involves changes in the cytoskeleton; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying platelet inhibition and its correlation with cytoskeletal cellular stiffness are poorly understood.\n\nWe measured the cellular stiffness of individual platelets after treatment with the NO-GC stimulator riociguat or the NO-GC activator cinaciguat, using scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM). We quantified changes in platelet shape using deep learning-based platelet morphometry. Cytoskeletal actin polymerization and platelet activation were measured by co-immunostaining F-actin and P-selectin, respectively. To test for clinical applicability of NO-GC stimulators in the context of increased thrombogenicity risk, we investigated the effect of riociguat on platelets from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients taking abacavir sulphate (ABC)-containing regimens, compared with HIV-negative volunteers.\n\nStimulation of human and murine platelets with the NO-GC stimulator riociguat or with the NO-GC activator cinaciguat downregulated P-selectin expression, decreased F-actin polymerization, and decreased cellular stiffness by {approx}50%, compared to vehicle control. In addition, platelets became more circular, indicating decreased activation. Riociguat did not cause any change in platelet aggregation or circularity in HIV-positive patients taking ABC-containing regimens.\n\nThese results corroborate a functional role of the NO-GC enzyme in platelet biomechanics (cellular stiffness) in correlation with the inhibition of platelet activation and morphological changes. The observed changes in stiffness and platelet shape therefore demonstrate the possibility of pharmacologically targeting the NO-GC/cGMP pathway.",

    "abstract": "The synthesis capabilities of the translation system (TS) provide engineering and directed evolution potential as well as a system for generating novel polymers. Orthogonal translation systems offer a parallel platform for translation engineering, enabling primary and secondary translation systems to operate independently without interfering with each other. However, current translation platforms for engineering lack complete orthogonality between the primary and secondary systems. Using a combination of indirect modifications through antibiotics, truncations of mito-rProteins mL50 and uL23, and replacement of mito-rProtein uL2, we develop and test the mitochondrial translation system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a fully orthogonal platform for in vivo directed evolution of translation. Our results show that continuous, comprehensive, creative, directed-evolution of a fully orthogonal TS in vivo appears to be a useful approach for technical control of the TS. This study emphasizes the power of system-wide evolutionary approaches over rational design. Evolution is creative and non-linear and can find unexpected solutions to problems.\n\nSignificanceAll life operates on the central dogma, information flows from DNA to mRNA to protein. The translation system decodes mRNA and produces proteins. Engineering and evolving the translation system permits full technical control over this process and could lead to the generation of novel polymers. Here we explore the mitochondrial translation system in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae for directed evolution of translation. We modify and evolve the translation system both directly and indirectly using antibiotics and gene editing tools and then measure resulting functionality.

    "abstract": "BackgroundSeveral studies have documented the significant impact of methodological choices in microbiome analyses. The myriad of methodological options available complicate the replication of results and generally limit the comparability of findings between independent studies that use differing techniques and measurement pipelines. Here we describe the Mosaic Standards Challenge (MSC), an international interlaboratory study designed to assess the impact of methodological variables on the results. The MSC did not prescribe methods but rather asked participating labs to analyze 7 shared reference samples (5x human stool samples and 2x mock communities) using their standard laboratory methods. To capture the array of methodological variables, each participating lab completed a metadata reporting sheet that included 100 different questions regarding the details of their protocol. The goal of this study was to survey the methodological landscape for microbiome metagenomic sequencing (MGS) analyses and the impact of methodological decisions on metagenomic sequencing results.\n\nResultsA total of 44 labs participated in the MSC by submitting results (16S or WGS) along with accompanying metadata; thirty 16S rRNA gene amplicon datasets and 14 WGS datasets were collected. The inclusion of two types of reference materials (human stool and mock communities) enabled analysis of both MGS measurement variability between different protocols using the biologically-relevant stool samples, and MGS bias with respect to ground truth values using the DNA mixtures. Owing to the compositional nature of MGS measurements, analyses were conducted on the ratio of Firmicutes: Bacteroidetes allowing us to directly apply common statistical methods. The resulting analysis demonstrated that protocol choices have significant effects, including both bias of the MGS measurement associated with a particular methodological choices, as well as effects on measurement robustness as observed through the spread of results between labs making similar methodological choices. In the analysis of the DNA mock communities, MGS measurement bias was observed even when there was general consensus among the participating laboratories.\n\nConclusionThis study was the result of a collaborative effort that included academic, commercial, and government labs. In addition to highlighting the impact of different methodological decisions on MGS result comparability, this work also provides insights for consideration in future microbiome measurement study design.",

    "abstract": "The Mimivirus 1.2Mb genome is organized into a nucleocapsid-like genomic fiber composed of a mixture of two GMC-oxidoreductase paralogs (1). Surprisingly, these proteins also constitute the glycosylated fibril layer that decorates the virion (2). The individual inactivation of each gene by homologous recombination-based knockout (KO) confirmed that they are not essential. The resulting genomic fiber corresponds to a 5- and a 6-start helix, similar to the wild type structures, and is composed of the remaining GMC-oxidoreductase. A model is proposed explaining the transition from a 6- to a 5-start helix and their coexistence. The two single mutants and the double mutant, for which both genes have been KO, showed equivalent fitness in laboratory conditions with no impact on the glycosylation of the layer of fibrils surrounding the capsids. Their major protein components can be easily exchanged, as highlighted by the double KO fibril layer composition. Accordingly, we show that the proteins composing the fibril layer can already be different between different members of the family (moumouviruses and megaviruses), echoing their differences in glycan composition (3, 4). These results obtained on two distinct essential processes (genome packaging and virion infectivity) illustrate the exceptional functional redundancy of the Mimiviridae, which may be the major evolutionary force behind their giant genomes.\n\nOne-Sentence Summary: Functional redundancy warrants mimivirus genomic fiber and fibril layer formation.\n\nSubject Area: Biological sciences/Microbiology/Virology/Viral evolution; Biological sciences/Microbiology/Virology/Virus structures",

Its extensive cultivation has made this plant the target of many viral, fungal, and bacterial diseases. Among them, the bacterial canker of tomato caused by Clavibacter michiganensis (Cm) has been named one of the most devastating diseases affecting the tomato industry worldwide. It can significantly reduce the yields and profitability of this crop. One of the big challenges we found when working with Cm and trying to characterize the virulence of different isolates was the lack of a consensus methodology to inoculate tomato plants, how to fertilize them and characterize Cm virulence. This research aimed to identify an artificial inoculation method to induce bacterial canker on tomato plants in greenhouse conditions to homogenize the results of different studies with Cm. We compared two inoculation methods, including the scalpel and syringe method with two levels of fertilization, low and high fertilization. After evaluating several variables like the percentage of necrotic leaves and the height of the plants, the results showed that the syringe inoculation with low fertilization was the most effective inoculation method allowing the development of a multilevel scale that can be used to study the interaction between tomato plants and Cm isolates.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is one of the largest threats to grassland plant species, which can be modified by land management. Although climate change and land management can separately and interactively influence plant demography this has been rarely considered within one experimental set-up. We used a large-scale experiment to quantify the effects of grassland management, climate change and their joint effect on the demography and population growth rate of 11 native plant species. We parameterized integral projection models with four years of demographic data to project the population growth rate. We hypothesized, plants would perform better in ambient than in the future climate treatment that creates hotter and drier summer conditions and that plant performance in grazing vs. mowing would vary across species and depend on their traits. Due to extreme drought events, over half of our study species went quasi extinct, which highlights how extreme climate events can influence long term experimental results. Of the persistent species, only one supported our expectations, and the rest either had higher population growth rates in the future climate treatment or showed no significant difference in population growth between climate treatments. Species with shorter flowering durations performed better in the mowing treatment while those with longer flowering durations performed better in the grazing treatment. The population growth rates of these species were sensitive to changes in vital rates related to reproduction and recruitment. Depending on the species we found effects of land management and climate change on population growth rates but we did not find strong support for interactive effects among both factors. Experiments combined with measuring plant demographic responses provide a way to isolate the effects of different drivers on the long-term persistence of species, and to identify the demographic vital rates that are critical to manage in the future. Our study suggests that it will become increasingly difficult to maintain species with preferences for moister soil conditions, that traits such as flowering duration might predict responses to management, and that vital rates such as reproduction and recruitment are disproportionately important.",

    "abstract": "Reptiles exhibit a variety of modes of sex determination, including both temperature-dependent and genetic mechanisms. Among those species with genetic sex determination, sex chromosomes of varying heterogamety (XX/XY and ZZ/ZW) have been observed with different degrees of differentiation. Karyotype studies have demonstrated that Gila monsters (Heloderma suspectum) have ZZ/ZW sex determination and this system is likely homologous to the ZZ/ZW system in the Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis), but little else is known about their sex chromosomes. Here, we report the assembly and analysis of the Gila monster genome. We generated a de novo draft genome assembly for a male using 10X Genomics technology. We further generated and analyzed short-read whole genome sequencing and whole transcriptome sequencing data for three males and three females. By comparing female and male genomic data, we identified four putative Z-chromosome scaffolds. These putative Z-chromosome scaffolds are homologous to Z-linked scaffolds identified in the Komodo dragon. Further, by analyzing RNAseq data, we observed evidence of incomplete dosage compensation between the Gila monster Z chromosome and autosomes and a lack of balance in Z-linked expression between the sexes. In particular, we observe lower expression of the Z in females (ZW) than males (ZZ) on a global basis, though we find evidence suggesting local gene-by-gene compensation. This pattern has been observed in most other ZZ/ZW systems studied to date and may represent a general pattern for female heterogamety in vertebrates.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe coastal wetland tree species Melaleuca quinquenervia (Cav.) S.T.Blake (Myrtaceae), commonly named the broad-leaved paperbark, is a foundation species in eastern Australia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and New Caledonia. The species has been widely grown as an ornamental, becoming invasive in areas such as Florida in the United States. Long-lived trees must respond to a wide range pests and pathogens throughout their lifespan, and immune receptors encoded by the nucleotide- binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing (NLR) gene family play a key role in plant stress responses. Expansion of this gene family is driven largely by tandem duplication, resulting in a clustering arrangement on chromosomes. Due to this clustering and their highly repetitive domain structure, comprehensive annotation of NLR encoding genes within genomes has been difficult. Additionally, as many genomes are still presented in their haploid, collapsed state, the full allelic diversity of the NLR gene family has not been widely published for outcrossing tree species.\n\nResultsWe assembled a chromosome-level pseudo-phased genome for M. quinquenervia and describe the full allelic diversity of plant NLRs using the novel FindPlantNLRs pipeline. Analysis reveals variation in the number of NLR genes on each haplotype, differences in clusters and in the types and numbers of novel integrated domains.\n\nConclusionsWe anticipate that the high quality of the genome for M. quinquenervia will provide a new framework for functional and evolutionary studies into this important tree species. Our results indicate a likely role for maintenance of NLR allelic diversity to enable response to environmental stress, and we suggest that this allelic diversity may be even more important for long-lived plants.",

    "abstract": "The availability of large scale epigenomic data from different cell types and conditions has provided valuable information to evaluate and learn features that predict co-binding of transcription factors (TF). However, previous attempts to develop models for predicting motif co-occurrence were not scalable for global analysis of any combination of motifs or cross-species predictions. Further, mapping co-regulatory modules (CRM) to their gene regulatory networks (GRN) is crucial in understanding the underlying function. Currently, there is no comprehensive pipeline to locate CRM and GRN on a large scale with speed and accuracy. In this study, we analyzed and evaluated different TF binding characteristics that would facilitate co-binding with biological significance to identify all possible clusters of co-binding TFs. We curated the UniBind database, which contains ChIP-Seq data from over 1983 samples and 232 TFs, and implemented two machine learning models to predict CRMs and potential regulatory networks they operate on. We narrowed our focus to study heart related regulatory motifs. Our findings highlight the importance of the NKX family of transcription factors in cardiac development and provide potential targets for further investigation in cardiac disease.",

Pb is an obligate soil-borne plant root pathogen which makes the study of Pb biology and its interaction with its host challenging. To overcome this challenge, we adopted an axenic cell culture method to study the interaction of Pb with its host plant Brassica spp. at the cellular and molecular levels. Pb, during its life cycle within the host, was confined to the cytoplasm of the infected cells. Our results showed that upon Pb infection, the dynamics of the plant cell organelles including mitochondria, plastids, nuclei, vacuoles, vesicles were altered. Both Plants and parasites diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT) genes were highly expressed in the calli, which indicated a need for the oil accumulation at the switch between replication and growth stages of the pathogen. This notion was supported by the accumulation of oil bodies that were only observed inside the pathogen cells. Our results also indicated that starch was utilized by the Pb in infected cells, an indication that Pb induces cell viability by altering the host carbon metabolism. The ongoing dynamic changes in the infected plant cell organelles suggest that plant responds to Pb infection, through the induction of organellar plasticity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWorking memory (WM) is essential for everyday life, yet its neural mechanism remains unclear. Although the hippocampus plays a critical role in memory consolidation and retrieval, its role in WM tasks has yet to be fully elucidated. We hypothesized that multiunit activities in the hippocampus alter their representations depending on the memory load and phase of a WM task, particularly in relation to sharp-wave ripple complexes (SWRs), which are known as various cognitive biomarkers.\n\nMethodsWe used an open dataset of intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) data and multiunit activity recorded from the medial temporal lobe (MTL) of nine patients with epilepsy. The MTL includes the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala. During the recording, all subjects performed an eight-second Sternberg test, in which they memorized sets of four, six, or eight letters (encoding phase), waited for three seconds (maintenance phase), and recalled whether a probe letter was included (Match IN task) or not (Mismatch OUT task) (retrieval phase). We used Gaussian-process factor analysis to visualize the neural trajectories of multiunit activity in MTL regions during the task. We also detected SWRs from the iEEG data in the hippocampus.\n\nFindingsWe found that the trajectory distance between phases of the Sternberg task was larger in the hippocampus compared to the entorhinal cortex and amygdala. Additionally, the trajectory distance between the encoding and retrieval phases was memory load dependent. Moreover, a transient trajectory increase was detected during SWRs. Finally, the trajectory direction of the hippocampus fluctuated between the encoding and retrieval states, and the balance of the fluctuation was shifted to the retrieval state during SWR periods.\n\nInterpretationOur results demonstrate the involvement of the hippocampus during a WM task. Furthermore, it is suggested that SWR in the retrieval phase plays a role in memory retrieval for a WM task. Our results provide new insight into the two-stage model of memory formation.",

Rodent research shows prominent low theta ([~]3-6 Hz), high theta ([~]6-12 Hz), and gamma (>30 Hz) rhythms in the BLA local field potential recordings. However, it is not understood what role these rhythms play in supporting the plasticity. Here, we create a biophysically detailed model of the BLA circuit to show that several classes of interneurons (PV+, SOM+, and VIP+) in the BLA can be critically involved in producing the rhythms; these rhythms promote the formation of a dedicated fear circuit shaped through rhythmic gating of spike-timing-dependent plasticity. Each class of interneurons is necessary for the plasticity. We find that the low theta rhythm is a biomarker of successful fear conditioning. Finally, we discuss how the peptide released by the VIP+ cell may alter the dynamics of plasticity to support the necessary fine timing.",

    "abstract": "In microbial systems, a metabolic pathway can be either completed by one autonomous population or alternatively be distributed among a consortium performing metabolic division of labor (MDOL), where several specialized populations cooperate to complete the pathway. MDOL facilitates the systems function by reducing the metabolic burden; however, it may also hinder the function by reducing the exchange efficiency of metabolic intermediates among individuals. As a result, the metabolic efficiency of a community is influenced by trade-offs between the metabolic specialization and versatility of individuals, with the latter potentially introducing metabolic redundancy into the community. However, it remains unclear how metabolic specialization and versatility of the individuals involved can be controlled in order to optimize the function of the community. In this study, we deconstructed the metabolic pathway of naphthalene degradation into four specialized steps and introduced them individually or combinatorically into different strains, with varying levels of metabolic specialization. Using these strains, we engineered 1,456 synthetic consortia with varying levels of metabolic redundancy and tested their naphthalene degradation efficiency. We found that 74 consortia possessing metabolic redundancy exhibited higher degradation efficiency than both the autonomous population and the rigorous MDOL community. Quantitative modeling derived from our experiments provides general strategies for identifying the most effective MDOL consortium with functional redundancy (MCFR) from a range of possible MCFRs. Our large-scale genomic analysis suggests that natural communities for hydrocarbon degradation are mostly functionally redundant. In summary, our study provides critical insights into the engineering of high-performance microbial systems and explains why functional redundancy is prevalent in natural microbial communities.",

    "abstract": "Micro- and nanoplastics are widespread in the marine environment including polar regions across Antarctica. In Antarctic penguins, eighty percent of microplastics were identified as polyethylene and ten percent as polyester. To analyze the toxicity of these two polymers, oligomers with different numbers of units were used as models. The use of oligomers as polymer models has been used previously with success. We started with the monomer and continued with different oligomers until the chain length was greater than 2 nm. According to the results of quantum chemistry, polyester is a better oxidant than polyethylene, since it is a better electron acceptor. Although there is less polyester than polyethylene in penguins, the presence of polyester may be more harmful than the presence of polyethylene for three reasons: polyester is better electron acceptor and therefore a better oxidant than polyethylene; polyester has negatively charged oxygen atoms and can promote stronger interactions than polyethylene with other molecules; polyester forms stable complexes and can dissociate the guanine-cytosine nucleobase pair. This could affect DNA replication. This theoretical information helps to elucidate the potential damage of micro- and nanoplastics.",

    "abstract": "In evolutionary quantitative genetics, the missing fraction problem refers to the case where phenotypes seen later in life are biased because a non-random subset of those phenotypes are missing from the population due to prior viability selection on correlated traits. As any such missing fraction will bias our estimates of selection, and therefore, responses to selection, it is one potential explanation for the paradox of stasis seen in wild populations. The two components required for the missing fraction problem to arise are: (1) viability selection; and (2) correlation between later-life traits and those important for early-life survival. Although it is plausible that these conditions are widespread in wild populations, this problem has received very little attention since it was first discussed (Grafen 1988; Hadfield 2008). It is impossible to know what phenotypes would have been expressed later in life by individuals who died during an earlier episode of viability selection, which has probably put researchers off. Here we show that we can break the problem down into episodes of selection and recover either (a) true estimates of phenotypic selection for later-life traits, or (b) adjusted estimates of the response to selection, depending on the data available. Implementation of complex statistics should uncover how prevalent the problem may be across many existing datasets (the latter approach). Whereas overall, we hope that viewing the missing fraction problem as an episodes of selection problem increases motivation, and provides justification, for a shift in focus to directly studying early-life viability selection.\n\n\"...what a correlation with [lifetime reproductive success] or its components tells you depends on the causes of the natural variation in the character.

Since the length of uninterrupted CAG repeat, not polyglutamine, determines the age-at-onset in HD, base editing strategies to convert CAG to CAA are anticipated to delay onset by shortening the uninterrupted CAG repeat. Here, we developed base editing strategies to convert CAG in the repeat to CAA and determined their molecular outcomes and effects on relevant disease phenotypes. Base editing strategies employing combinations of cytosine base editors and gRNAs efficiently converted CAG to CAA at various sites in the CAG repeat without generating significant indels, off-target edits, or transcriptome alterations, demonstrating their feasibility and specificity. Candidate BE strategies converted CAG to CAA on both expanded and non-expanded CAG repeats without altering HTT mRNA and protein levels. In addition, somatic CAG repeat expansion, which is the major disease driver in HD, was significantly decreased by a candidate BE strategy treatment in HD knock-in mice carrying canonical CAG repeats. Notably, CAG repeat expansion was abolished entirely in HD knock-in mice carrying CAA-interrupted repeats, supporting the therapeutic potential of CAG-to-CAA conversion base editing strategies in HD and potentially other repeat expansion disorders.",

The canonical hinged-lid model has long predicted that a hydrophobic motif in the DIII-DIV linker (IFM) acts as the gating particle that occludes the permeation pathway during fast inactivation. However, the fact that the IFM motif is located far from the pore in recent high-resolution structures of Nav+ channels contradicts this status quo model. The precise molecular determinants of fast inactivation gate once again, become an open question. Here, we provide a mechanistic reinterpretation of fast inactivation based on ionic and gating current data. In Nav1.4 the actual inactivation gate is comprised of two hydrophobic rings at the bottom of S6. These function in series and closing once the IFM motif binds. Reducing the volume of the sidechain in both rings led to a partially conductive inactivated state. Our experiments also point to a previously overlooked coupling pathway between the bottom of S6 and the selectivity filter.",
