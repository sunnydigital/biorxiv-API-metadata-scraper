    "abstract": "The development of CD4 and CD8 T cells in the thymus is critical to adaptive immunity and is widely studied as a model of lineage commitment. Recognition of self-MHCI/II by the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) determines the lineage choice, but how distinct TCR signals drive transcriptional programs of lineage commitment remains largely unknown. We applied CITE-seq to measure RNA and surface proteins in thymocytes from wild-type and lineage-restricted mice to generate a comprehensive timeline of cell state for each lineage. These analyses revealed a sequential process whereby all thymocytes initiate CD4 lineage differentiation during an initial wave of TCR signaling, followed by a second TCR signaling wave that coincides with CD8 lineage specification. CITE-seq and pharmaceutical inhibition experiments implicate a TCR/calcineurin/NFAT/GATA3 axis in driving the CD4 fate. Overall, our data suggest that multiple redundant mechanisms contribute to the accuracy and efficiency of the lineage choice.",

    "abstract": "A wide variety of electrical activities are observed to occur in the brain. They include one dimensional voltage pulses (action potentials) that propagate along nerve fibers, transient localized oscillations, and persistent surface waveforms oscillating in five distinct frequency bands, called EEG waveforms. However, although a satisfactory theory for propagating pulses exists a unified theoretical framework for modeling all its excitations is lacking. In this paper we construct a special surface network in which all observed brain-like signals can be generated by topological means. The network has surface electrons,is, as we will prove, an exact topological surface representation of the unknown intricate connectivity architecture of the brains nerve fibers, and its surface has a mathematical representation. A dynamical law which requires that all input and out put signals of the network respect the mathematical structure of the surface is used to study the network. Using this law it is shown that all brain-like signals can be generated by input signals that locally deform the surface of a subunit of the network, transiently, reducing its topology to that of a sphere. The topological spheres thus produced have surface voltage oscillating waveforms in five theoretically determined frequencies bands and are identified as EEG waveforms. Methods for analyzing these waveforms are developed and used to explain their observed deep sleep structures and determine their properties.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular matrices generally contain fibril-like polymers that may be organized in parallel arrays. Although their role in morphogenesis has been long recognized, it is still unclear how the subcellular control of fibril synthesis translates into well-defined organ shape. Here, we addressed this question using the Arabidopsis sepal as a model organ. In plants, cell growth is driven by turgor pressure and restrained by the extracellular matrix known as the cell wall. Cellulose is the main load-bearing component of the plant cell wall and cellulose microfibrils are thought to channel growth perpendicularly to their main orientation. Given the key function of CELLULOSE SYNTHASE INTERACTIVE 1 (CSI1) in guidance of cellulose synthesis, we investigated the role of CSI1 in sepal morphogenesis. We observed that sepals from csi1 mutants are shorter, although their newest cellulose microfibrils are more aligned compared to wild type. Surprisingly, cell growth anisotropy was similar in csi1 and wild-type plants. We resolved this apparent paradox using polarized Raman microspectroscopy, live imaging of growing sepals, and bespoke mechanical assays. We found that CSI1 is required for spatial consistency of growth direction across the sepal and for the maintenance of overall organ elongation. Our work illustrates how the subcellular regulation of the extracellular matrix may control morphogenesis at multiple scales.",

    "abstract": "In plants, timely degeneration of tapetal cells is essential for providing nutrients and other substances to support pollen development. Rapid alkalinization factors (RALFs) are small, cysteine-rich peptides known to be involved in various aspects of plant development and growth, and defense against biotic and abiotic stresses. However, the functions of most of them remain unknown, while no RALF has been reported to involve in tapetum degeneration. In this study, we demonstrated that a novel cysteine-rich peptide EaF82 isolated from shy-flowering  Golden Pothos plants is a RALF-like peptide and displays alkalinizing activity. Its heterologous expression in Arabidopsis delayed tapetum degeneration and reduced pollen production and seed yields. RNAseq, RT-qPCR and biochemical analyses showed that overexpressing EaF82 down-regulated a group of genes involved in pH changes, cell wall modifications, tapetum degeneration and pollen maturation as well as seven endogenous Arabidopsis RALF genes, and decreased proteasome activity and ATP levels. Yeast two-hybrid screening identified AKIN10, a subunit of energy-sensing SnRK1 kinase, to be its interacting partner. Our study reveals a possible regulatory role for RALF peptide in tapetum degeneration and suggests that EaF82 action may be mediated through AKIN10 leading to the alteration of transcriptome and energy metabolism, thereby causing ATP deficiency and impairing pollen development.",

    "abstract": "About a quarter of total human cancers carry mutations in Ras isoforms. Accumulating evidence suggests that small GTPases, RalA and RalB, and their activators, Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RalGEFs), play an essential role in oncogenic Ras-induced signalling. We studied the interaction between human KRas4B and the Ras association (RA) domain of Rgl2 (Rgl2RA), one of the RA-containing RalGEFs. We show that the G12V oncogenic KRas4B mutation changes the interaction kinetics with Rgl2RA. The crystal structure of the KRas4BG12V: Rgl2RA complex shows a 2:2 heterotetramer where the Switch I and Switch II regions of each KRasG12V interact with both Rgl2RA molecules. This structural arrangement is highly similar to the HRasE31K:RALGDSRA crystal structure and is distinct from the well-characterised Ras:Raf complex. Interestingly, the G12V mutation was found at the dimer interface of KRas4BG12V with its partner. Our study reveals a potentially distinct mode of Ras:effector complex formation by RalGEFs, and offers a possible mechanistic explanation for how the oncogenic KRas4BG12V hyperactivates the RalA/B pathway.\n\nSummary BlurbThe work reports the KRas4B.G12V oncogenic mutation alters the binding kinetics with Rgl2, a RalA/B activator, and the V12 resides at the KRas4B(G12V)*Rgl2 complex interface in the crystal structure.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPhencyclidine (PCP) causes psychosis, is abused with increasing frequency, and was extensively used in antipsychotic drug discovery. PCP discoordinates hippocampal ensemble action potential discharge and impairs cognitive control in rats, but how this uncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist impairs cognition remains unknown.\n\nMethodsThe effects of PCP were investigated i) on hippocampal CA1 ensemble action potential discharge in vivo in urethane-anesthetized rats and during awake behavior in mice; ii) on synaptic responses in ex vivo mouse hippocampus slices; iii) in mice on a hippocampus-dependent active place avoidance task that requires cognitive control; and iv) on activating the molecular machinery of translation in acute hippocampus slices. Mechanistic causality was assessed by comparing the PCP effects to the effects of inhibitors of protein synthesis, group-1-type metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1/5), and subunit-selective NMDARs.\n\nResultsConsistent with ionotropic actions, PCP discoordinated CA1 ensemble action potential discharge. PCP caused hyperactivity, and impaired active place avoidance, despite learning the task before PCP. Consistent with metabotropic actions, PCP exaggerated protein-synthesis dependent DHPG-induced mGluR1/5-stimulated long-term synaptic depression (LTD). Pretreatment with anisomycin or the mGluR1/5-antagonist MPEP, both of which repress translation, prevented the PCP-induced discoordination, and the cognitive and sensorimotor impairments.

    "abstract": "Aggregation of neuronal protein -synuclein is implicated in synucleinopathies, including Parkinsons disease. Despite abundant in vitro studies, the mechanism of -synuclein assembly process remains ambiguous. In this work, -synuclein aggregation was induced by its constant mixing in two separate modes, either by agitation in a 96-well microplate reader (MP) or in microcentrifuge tubes using a shaker incubator (SI). Aggregation in both modes occurred through a sigmoidal growth pattern with a well-defined lag, growth, and saturation phase. The end-stage MP- and SI-derived aggregates displayed distinct differences in morphological, biochemical, and spectral signatures as discerned through AFM, proteinase-K digestion, FTIR, Raman, and CD spectroscopy. The MP-derived aggregates showed irregular morphology with a significant random coil conformation, contrary to SI-derived aggregates, which showed typical {beta}-sheet fibrillar structures. The end-stage MP aggregates convert to {beta}-rich SI-like aggregates upon 1) seeding with SI-derived aggregates and 2) agitating in SI. We conclude that end-stage MP aggregates were in a kinetically trapped conformation, whose kinetic barrier was bypassed upon either seeding by SI-derived fibrils or shaking in SI. We further show that MP-derived aggregates that form in the presence of sorbitol, an osmolyte, displayed a {beta}-rich signature, indicating that the preferential exclusion effect of osmolytes helped overcome the kinetic barrier. Our findings help in unravelling the kinetic origin of different -synuclein aggregated polymorphs (strains) that encode diverse variants of synucleinopathies. We demonstrate that kinetic control shapes the polymorphic landscape of -synuclein aggregates, both through de novo generation of polymorphs, and by their interconversion.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) serves as a powerful technique for assessing the causal role of specific brain regions in behavior, including decision-making. While tES studies investigating sensorimotor function yield unequivocal results, cognitive research reveals considerable ambiguity and diversity in stimulation-related effects. The consequences of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on cognitive functioning are not consistently predictable based on the current direction (cathodal or anodal), which limits its applicability in cognitive research.\n\nIn the present study, we further explored tES effect ambiguity in cognitive tasks by modulating medial frontal cortex (MFC) activity in an auditory monetary incentive delay (MID) task, where participants responded to acoustic cues encoding expected monetary losses using cathodal tDCS. We analyzed feedback-related negativity (FRN), reflecting prediction error processing when participants encountered losses compared to no losses during two subsequent MID task sessions, and exogenous P2 response to stimulus onset unrelated to anticipated monetary incentives. We anticipated an inhibitory cathodal tDCS effect on both P2 response and FRN.\n\nContrary to our expectations, we observed a facilitatory effect of cathodal tDCS on FRN, replicating our earlier results (Gorin et al., 2022). No effect of stimulation was observed on P2; however, tDCS influenced the learning effect of P2. The difference in P2 amplitude between the first and second sessions, observed in the sham group, was absent in the group that received cathodal tDCS. We offered the interpretation of the complex picture of tES effects during auditory MID performance in light of brain plasticity theory for P2 and reward-learning mechanisms for FRN. Importantly, our findings regarding the multidirectionality of tDCS effects on cognitive function challenge the utility of tES as a readily employable method for testing brain causality in highly complex neurocognitive events, such as decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Ligand recognition by the human /{beta} T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) heterodimer protein, unlike the surface immunoglobulin (sIg) B-cell receptor, is not governed by relative binding affinity. Its interaction with the peptide (p) plus major histocompatibility complex (MHC) protein (abbrev. pMHC) likely involves some different molecular mechanism linking pMHC binding to T-cell functions. Recent analytical geometry of TCR:pMHC-II solved crystallographic structures (n = 40) revealed that each variable (V)-domain is bound in similar, yet mathematically unique orientations to its target pMHC groove. The relative position of the central cysteine of each V-domain was examined by multivariable calculus in spherical coordinates, where a simple volume element (dV) was found to describe clonotypic geometry with pMHC-II. Here, the study was expanded to include TCR:pMHC-I structures, and to model a physical mechanism, specifically involving the two directionally opposed inclined planes (IP) manifest by the two major -helices prominent in both MHC-I and MHC-II proteins. Calculations for rotational torque of each V-domain, together with acceleration up and down the slopes of both MHC -helices were used to estimate the time a given V-domain spends sliding down its cognate MHC IP. This V-domain rotation/sliding mechanism appears to be quantitatively unique for each TCR:pMHC V-domain (n = 40). However, there is an apparent and common dichotomy between the mobility of each V-domain with respect to the two classes of MHC proteins. Evolutionary motifs in the MHC helices support that the V-domains negotiate the opposed inclined planes of pMHC ligands in clonotypic fashion. Thus, this model is useful in understanding how mechanical forces are linked to TCR function.",

The study looked at mitochondrial concentration, mean age, and age density distribution in relation to the distance from the soma. We developed models for a symmetric axon containing 14 demand sites and an asymmetric axon containing 10 demand sites. We examined how the concentration of mitochondria changes when an axon splits into two branches at the branching junction. We also studied whether mitochondria concentrations in the branches are affected by what proportion of mitochondrial flux enters the upper branch and what proportion of flux enters the lower branch. Additionally, we explored whether the distributions of mitochondria mean age and age density in branching axons are affected by how the mitochondrial flux splits at the branching junction. When the mitochondrial flux is split unevenly at the branching junction of an asymmetric axon, with a greater proportion of the flux entering the longer branch, the average age of mitochondria (system age) in the axon increases. Our findings elucidate the effects of axonal branching on mitochondria age. Mitochondria aging is the focus of this study as recent research suggests it may be involved in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinsons disease.",

    "abstract": "Seeds are an essential food source, providing nutrients for germination and early seedling growth. Degradation events in the seed and the mother plant accompany seed development. One degradation mechanism is autophagy, facilitating cellular component breakdown in the lytic organelle. Autophagy influences various aspects of plant physiology, specifically nutrient availability and remobilization, suggesting its involvement in source-sink interactions. During seed development, autophagy was shown to affect nutrient remobilization from mother plants and function in the embryo. Yet, these studies examined autophagy-knockout (atg mutant) plants, making it impossible to distinguish between the contribution of autophagy in the source (i.e., the mother plant) and the sink tissue (i.e., the embryo).\n\nTo address this, we employed a novel approach to differentiate between autophagy in source and sink tissues. We investigated how autophagy in the maternal tissue affects seed development by performing reciprocal crosses between WT and atg mutant Arabidopsis thaliana plants. Although F1 seedlings possessed a functional autophagy mechanism, etiolated F1 plants from maternal atg mutants displayed reduced growth. This was attributed to altered protein but not lipid accumulation in the seeds, suggesting autophagy differentially regulates carbon and nitrogen remobilization. Surprisingly, F1 seeds of maternal atg mutants exhibited faster germination, resulting from different seed coat development.\n\nOur study emphasizes the significance of examining autophagy in a tissue-specific manner, revealing valuable insights into the interplay between different tissues during seed development. It sheds light on the tissue-specific functions of autophagy, offering potential for new research into the underlying mechanisms governing seed development and crop yield.",

We show that the current state-of-the-art can be advanced significantly by applying a novel variation of the Transformer architecture, called Split-Transformer Impute (STI), coupled with improved preprocessing of data input into deep learning models. We performed extensive experiments to benchmark STI against existing methods using resequencing datasets from human 1000 Genomes Project and yeast genomes. Results establish superior performance of our new methods compared to competing genotype imputation methods in terms of accuracy and imputation quality score in the benchmark datasets.",

    "abstract": "Sulfolactate (SL) is a short-chain organosulfonate that is an important reservoir of sulfur in the biosphere. SL is produced by oxidation of sulfolactaldehyde (SLA), which in turn derives from sulfoglycolysis of the sulfosugar sulfoquinovose, or through oxidation of 2,3-dihydroxypropanesulfonate. Oxidation of SLA is catalyzed by SLA dehydrogenases belonging to the aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily. We report that SLA dehydrogenase RlGabD from the sulfoglycolytic bacterium Rhizobium leguminsarum SRDI565 can use both NAD+ and NADP+ as cofactor to oxidize SLA, and indicatively operates through a rapid equilibrium ordered mechanism. We report the cryo-EM structure of RlGabD bound to NADH, revealing a tetrameric quaternary structure and supporting proposal of organosulfonate binding residues in the active site, and a catalytic mechanism. Sequence based homology searches identified SLA dehydrogenase homologs in a range of putative sulfoglycolytic gene clusters in bacteria predominantly from the phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. This work provides a structural and biochemical view of SLA dehydrogenases to complement our knowledge of SLA reductases, and provide detailed insights into a critical step in the organosulfur cycle.\n\nGraphical abstractSulfolactate is an important species in the biogeochemical sulfur cycle.

    "abstract": "Telomeres protect chromosome ends from unscheduled DNA repair, including from the MRN (MRE11, RAD50, NBS1) complex, which plays a critical role in the processing of double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs). MRN orchestrates activation of the ATM kinase in the cellular DNA damage response (DDR), promotes DNA end-tethering aiding the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, and initiates DSB resection through the MRE11 nuclease. A previously identified protein motif (MIN, for MRN inhibitor) downregulates MRN activity via binding to RAD50 and has independently arisen at least twice, through convergent evolution of telomeric proteins Rif2 and Taz1, in budding and fission yeast respectively. We now provide a third example of convergent evolution for this binding mechanism for MRN at telomeres, by demonstrating that the iDDR motif of the human shelterin protein TRF2 binds to human RAD50 at the same site engaged by the MIN motif in the yeast proteins, despite lacking sequence homology. Modelling for the human CtIP interaction with RAD50 (necessary for activation of MRE11), and for the budding and fission yeast counterparts Sae2 and Ctp1, indicates that the interaction is mutually exclusive with binding of the iDDR/MIN motifs, pointing to a conserved mechanism for inhibition of MRN nuclease activity at telomeres.",

During ER stress, IRE1s ER lumenal domain (LD) drives its clustering on the ER membrane to initiate signaling. How IRE1s LD assembles into high-order oligomers remains largely unknown. By in vitro reconstitution experiments we show that human IRE1 LD forms dynamic biomolecular condensates. IRE1 LD condensates were stabilized when IRE1 LD was tethered to model membranes and upon binding of unfolded polypeptide ligands. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that weak multivalent interactions are involved in IRE1 LD assemblies. Mutagenesis showed that disordered regions in IRE1 LD control its clustering in vitro and in cells. Importantly, dysregulated clustering led to defects in IRE1 signaling. Our results reveal that membranes and unfolded polypeptides act as scaffolds to assemble dynamic IRE1 condensates into stable, signaling competent clusters.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are highly dynamic double membrane-bound organelles that maintain their shape in part through fission and fusion. Mitochondrial fission is performed by the dynamin-related protein Dnm1 (Drp1 in humans), a large GTPase that constricts and divides the mitochondria in a GTP hydrolysis-dependent manner. However, it is unclear whether factors inside mitochondria help coordinate the process and if Dnm1/Drp1 activity alone is sufficient to complete fission of both mitochondrial membranes. Here, we identify an intermembrane space protein required for mitochondrial fission in yeast, which we propose to name Mdi1. Loss of Mdi1 leads to hyper-fused mitochondria networks due to defects in mitochondrial fission, but not lack of Dnm1 recruitment to mitochondria. Mdi1 plays a conserved role in fungal species and its homologs contain a putative amphipathic -helix, mutations in which disrupt mitochondrial morphology. One model to explain these findings is that Mdi1 associates with and distorts the mitochondrial inner membrane to enable Dnm1 to robustly complete fission. Our work reveals that Dnm1 cannot efficiently divide mitochondria without the coordinated function of a protein that resides inside mitochondria.",

Organelle membranes and contacts also undergo structural and functional alterations. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, regulated expression of Uip4 is shown to be a critical effector of nuclear shape and function, particularly during the stationary phase. In this work, we demonstrate that the absence of UIP4 affects the morphology of multiple other organelles including mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, vacuole and the distribution of lipid droplets. The results show that modulating carbon source, nitrogen availability and cellular energy state impact Uip4 expression. This expression of Uip4 is controlled by the transcription factor Msn2, downstream of Sch9 signaling pathway. Cells lacking Uip4 have poor survival in the stationary phase of the growth cycle. These cellular changes are concomitant with dysregulation of the global lipidome profile and aberrant organelle interaction. We propose that the dynamic and regulated expression of Uip4 is required to maintain lipid homeostasis and organelle architecture which is ultimately required to survive in nutrient limiting conditions such as stationary phase.",

    "abstract": "Cysteine residues can undergo multiple posttranslational modifications with diverse functional consequences, potentially behaving as tunable sensors. The intermediate filament protein vimentin has important implications in pathophysiology, including cancer progression, infection, and fibrosis, and maintains a close interplay with other cytoskeletal structures, such as actin filaments and microtubules. We previously showed that the single vimentin cysteine, C328, is a key target for oxidants and electrophiles. Here, we demonstrate that structurally diverse cysteine-reactive agents, including electrophilic mediators, oxidants and drug-related compounds, disrupt the vimentin network eliciting morphologically distinct reorganizations. As most of these agents display broad reactivity, we pinpointed the importance of C328 by confirming that local perturbations introduced through mutagenesis provoke structure-dependent vimentin rearrangements. Thus, GFP-vimentin wild type (wt) forms squiggles and short filaments in vimentin-deficient cells, the C328F, C328W, and C328H mutants generate diverse filamentous assemblies, and the C328A and C328D constructs fail to elongate yielding dots. Remarkably, vimentin C328H structures resemble the wt, but are strongly resistant to electrophile-elicited disruption. Therefore, the C328H mutant allows elucidating whether cysteine-dependent vimentin reorganization influences other cellular responses to reactive agents. Electrophiles such as 1,4-dinitro-1H-imidazole and 4-hydroxynonenal induce robust actin stress fibers in cells expressing vimentin wt. Strikingly, under these conditions, vimentin C328H expression blunts electrophile-elicited stress fiber formation, apparently acting upstream of RhoA. Analysis of additional vimentin C328 mutants shows that electrophile-sensitive and assembly-defective vimentin variants permit induction of stress fibers by reactive species, whereas electrophile-resistant filamentous vimentin structures prevent it. Together, our results suggest that vimentin acts as a break for actin stress fibers formation, which would be released by C328-aided disruption, thus allowing full actin remodeling in response to oxidants and electrophiles. These observations postulate C328 as a \"sensor\" transducing structurally diverse modifications into fine-tuned vimentin network rearrangements, and a gatekeeper for certain electrophiles in the interplay with actin.",

    "abstract": "Cell lineage tracking is a long-standing and unresolved problem in biology. Microfluidic technologies have the potential to address this problem, by virtue of their ability to manipulate and process single-cells in a rapid, controllable and efficient manner. Indeed, when coupled with traditional imaging approaches, microfluidic systems allow the experimentalist to follow single-cell divisions over time. Herein, we present a valve-based microfluidic system able to probe the decision-making processes of single-cells, by tracking their lineage over multiple generations. The system operates by trapping single-cells within growth chambers, allowing the trapped cells to grow and divide, isolating sister cells after a user-defined number of divisions and finally extracting them for downstream transcriptome analysis. The platform incorporates multiple cell manipulation operations, image processing-based automation for cell loading and growth monitoring, reagent addition and device washing. To demonstrate the efficacy of the microfluidic workflow, 6C2 (chicken erythroleukemia) and T2EC (primary chicken erythrocytic progenitors) cells are tracked inside the microfluidic device over two generations, with a cell viability rate in excess of 90%. Sister cells are successfully isolated after division and extracted within a 500 nL volume, which is compatible with downstream single-cell RNA sequencing analysis.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) play key roles in regulating the differentiation and function of stem cells, including muscle satellite cells (MuSCs), a resident stem cell population responsible for postnatal regeneration of the skeletal muscle. Sox11 belongs to the Sry-related HMG-box (SOX) family of TFs that play diverse roles in stem cell behavior and tissue specification. Analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets identify a specific enrichment of Sox11 mRNA in differentiating but not quiescent MuSCs. Consistent with the scRNA-seq data, Sox11 levels increase during differentiation of murine primary myoblasts in vitro. scRNA-seq data comparing muscle regeneration in young and old mice further demonstrate that Sox11 expression is reduced in aged MuSCs. Age-related decline of Sox11 expression is associated with reduced chromatin contacts within the topologically associated domains. Unexpectedly, Myod1Cre-driven deletion of Sox11 in embryonic myoblasts has no effects on muscle development and growth, resulting in apparently healthy muscles that regenerate normally. Pax7CreER or Rosa26CreER driven (MuSC-specific or global) deletion of Sox11 in adult mice similarly has no effects on MuSC differentiation or muscle regeneration. These results identify Sox11 as a novel myogenic differentiation marker with reduced expression in quiescent and aged MuSCs, but the specific function of Sox11 in myogenesis remain to be elucidated.",

P2Y2 receptor, an ATP-activated purinergic receptor, is typically associated with pulmonary, endothelial, and neurological cell signaling. Here we report its role and importance in breast epithelial cell signaling and how its altered in metastatic breast cancer. In response to ATP activation, P2Y2 receptor signaling causes an increase of intracellular Ca2+ in non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells, while their tumorigenic and metastatic counterparts have significantly reduced Ca2+ responses. The non-tumorigenic cells respond to increased Ca2+ with actin polymerization and localization to cellular junctions, while the metastatic cells remained unaffected. The increase in intracellular Ca2+ after ATP stimulation could be blunted using a P2Y2 antagonist, which also prevented actin mobilization in non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells. Furthermore, the lack of Ca2+ concentration changes and actin mobilization in the metastatic breast cancer cells could be due to reduced P2Y2 expression, which correlates with poorer overall survival in breast cancer patients. This study elucidates rapid changes that occur after elevated intracellular Ca2+ in breast epithelial cells and how metastatic cancer cells have adapted to evade this cellular response.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEThis work shows non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells increase intracellular Ca2+ after ATP-P2Y2 signaling and re-localize actin, while metastatic cells lack this response, due to decreased P2Y2 expression, which correlates with poorer survival.",

Made up of hundreds of proteins, focal adhesions are dynamic structures which can assemble and disassemble quickly, withstand strong actomyosin-applied forces, and form highly stable complexes.

Here, we use recombinant focal adhesion proteins to reconstitute the core structural machinery in vitro, with the goal of understanding the underlying protein dynamics and interactions. We observe liquid-liquid phase separation of the core focal adhesion proteins talin and vinculin for a spectrum of conditions and in combination with several interaction partners. Intriguingly, we show that membrane binding triggers phase separation of these proteins on the membrane, which in turn induces the enrichment of integrin in the clusters. We also introduce a novel experimental setup to probe talin-membrane interactions down to the single protein level. Our results suggest that membrane composition triggers condensate assembly at the membrane, a regulatory mechanism which could widely apply to membrane-localized biomolecular condensates and provide a pathway of how spatial organization of lipids within the membrane can couple into the cytosol.",

    "abstract": "Biomarker signature discovery remains the main path to develop clinical diagnostic tools when the biological knowledge on a pathology is weak. Shortest signatures are often preferred to reduce the cost of the diagnostic. The ability to find the best and shortest signature relies on the robustness of the models that can be built on such set of molecules. The classification algorithm that will be used is selected based on the average performance of its models, often expressed via the average AUC. However, it is not garanteed that an algorithm with a large AUC distribution will keep a stable performance when facing data. Here, we propose two AUC-derived hyper-stability scores, the HRS and the HSS, as complementary metrics to the average AUC, that should bring confidence in the choice for the best classification algorithm. To emphasize the importance of these scores, we compared 15 different Random Forests implementation. Additionally, the modelization time of each implementation was computed to further help deciding the best strategy. Our findings show that the Random Forest implementation should be chosen according to the data at hand and the classification question being evaluated. No Random Forest implementation can be used universally for any classification and on any dataset. Each of them should be tested for both their average AUC performance and AUC-derived stability, prior to analysis.\n\nAuthor summaryTo better measure the performance of a Machine Learning (ML) implementation, we introduce a new metric, the AUC hyper-stability, to be used in parallel with the average AUC. This AUC hyper-stability is able to discriminate ML implementations that show the same AUC performance. This metric can therefore help researchers in choosing the best ML method to get stable short predictive biomarker signatures. More specifically, we advocate a tradeoff between the average AUC performance, the hyper-stability scores, and the modeling time.",

However, the molecular underpinnings of this stromal-epithelial crosstalk are largely unknown. Here, we compare mesenchymal cells from four genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of prostate cancer representing different stages of the disease to their wild-type (WT) counterparts by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and, ultimately, to human tumors with comparable genotypes. We identified 8 transcriptionally and functionally distinct stromal populations responsible for common and GEMM-specific transcriptional programs. We show that stromal responses are conserved in mouse models and human prostate cancers with the same genomic alterations. We noted striking similarities between the transcriptional profiles of the stroma of murine models of advanced disease and those of of human prostate cancer bone metastases. These profiles were then used to build a robust gene signature that can predict metastatic progression in prostate cancer patients with localized disease and is also associated with progression-free survival independent of Gleason score. Taken together, this offers new evidence that stromal microenvironment mediates prostate cancer progression, further identifying tissue-based biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets of aggressive and metastatic disease.",

    "abstract": "Gagea bohemica s. lat. is a morphologically and karyologically highly variable group with many morphologically similar \"narrow\" taxa currently considered as a single variable species. It is predominantly distributed in Mediterranean and warmer parts of temperate belt of Europe. The large-scale data on its cytogeography and population cytotype structure which could provide a basis for taxonomy is lacking, only scattered data on ploidy have been published from various parts of its range. In this study, we sampled 106 populations in broader Central Europe, the northeastern Balkan Peninsula and the northwestern Black Sea coast in order to analyse their ploidy level, genome size and pollen stainability. Two cytotypes, i.e., tetraploid (2n = 48) and pentaploid (2n = 60), were found in the study area using chromosome counting and flow cytometry, both in pure and mixed-ploidy populations. Pure pentaploid populations are mainly distributed in Austria, Czechia, northwestern Hungary and Slovakia while tetraploid cytotype in pure and mixed-ploidy populations forming two lineages which are concentrated into two disjunct geographical areas: a western lineage in Germany and Switzerland, and an eastern one in Bulgaria, southeastern Hungary, northern Greece, Romania, Serbia and Ukraine. The two lineages differ in their genome size regardless of their ploidy, indicating their independent origin. Analysis of pollen stainability using a modified Alexander stain revealed an unusual pattern with tetraploids having a lower pollen stainability (mean 44.29 %) than pentaploids (mean 70.70 %) but the western and eastern populations differed again from each other.",

    "abstract": "Model-guided DNA sequence design can accelerate the reprogramming of living cells. It allows us to engineer more complex biological systems by removing the need to physically assemble and test each potential design. While mechanistic models of gene expression have seen some success in supporting this goal, data-centric, deep learning-based approaches often provide more accurate predictions. This accuracy, however, comes at a cost -- a lack of generalisation across genetic and experimental contexts, which has limited their wider use outside the context in which they were trained. Here, we address this issue by demonstrating how a simple transfer learning procedure can effectively tune a pre-trained deep learning model to predict protein translation rate from 5 untranslated region sequence (5UTR) for diverse contexts in Escherichia coli using a small number of new measurements. This allows for important model features learnt from expensive massively parallel reporter assays to be easily transferred to new settings. By releasing our trained deep learning model and complementary calibration procedure, this study acts as a starting point for continually refined model-based sequence design that builds on previous knowledge and future experimental efforts.",

In addition, many pIgs assemble with a joining-chain (JC); however, the number of monomers and potential to include JC varies with species and heavy chain class. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of IgM from a teleost (t) species, which does not encode JC. The structure revealed four tIgM Fcs linked through eight C-terminal tailpieces (Tps), which adopt a single {beta}-sandwich-like domain (Tp assembly) located between two Fcs. Remarkably, two of eight heavy chains fold uniquely, resulting in a structure distinct from mammalian IgM, which typically contains five IgM monomers, one JC and a centrally-located Tp assembly. Together with mutational analysis, structural data indicate that pIgs have evolved a range of assembly mechanisms and structures, each likely to support unique antibody effector functions.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput customizable CBA automated script-based analysisThe utility of high-throughput systems to evaluate antigen-specific antibody (Ab) has been highlighted by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Pathogen-specific Ab levels are often used to assess protection following vaccination and, in the case of novel pathogens, an indication of prior exposure. Several platforms exist to visualize antigen-specific Ab, however most are not quantitative and are difficult to scale for population level studies. Additionally, the sensitivity across platforms differs making direct comparisons between studies difficult. Cytometric bead arrays (CBA) are an attractive platform for antigen-specific Ab measurements as they can be used to assess Ab reactivity against several antigens and of several isotypes to be performed simultaneously. Additionally, CBAs exhibit high sensitivity and can be designed to provide quantitative measurements. Using commercially available particles, a biotin-Streptavidin bead loading strategy, and the inclusion of indirect standards, we describe a flexible system that can be modified to include a variety of antigens. Here we describe two arrays, focused on antigens derived from either {beta}-coronaviruses or influenza virus. To support the high-throughput capacity of this system, we developed a suit of automated software tools, the CBA Toolbox, to process raw data into antigen-reactive IgM, IgA, and IgG concentrations. We describe quality control requirements, assay performance, and normalizations to accurately quantitate antigen-specific Ig.",

However, little is known regarding which domains within mouse DUX interact with particular chromatin and transcription regulators. Here, we reveal that the C-terminus of mouse DUX contains five uncharacterized [~]100 amino acid (aa) repeats followed by an acidic 14 amino acid tail. Unexpectedly, structure-function approaches classify two repeats as  active and three as  inactive in cleavage/2CLC transcription program enhancement, with differences narrowed to a key 6 amino acid section. Our proximity dependent biotin ligation (BioID) approach identified factors selectively associated with active DUX repeat derivatives (including the 14aa  tail), including transcription and chromatin factors such as SWI/SNF (BAF) complex, as well as nucleolar factors that have been previously implicated in regulating the Dux locus. Finally, our mechanistic studies reveal cooperativity between DUX active repeats and the acidic tail in cofactor recruitment, DUX target opening, and transcription. Taken together, we provide several new insights into DUX structure-function, and mechanisms of chromatin and gene regulation.",

    "abstract": "Electromyographic (EMG) signals are used to gain insight into muscle activation patterns and thus neuromuscular control. To allow for comparisons between studies and participants, the EMG signal is generally normalised, with the signal obtained during a task that is designed to elicit maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) frequently used as the basis. Recommendations for how to collect MVCs have been made; however, previous studies have not been able to determine if the EMG variation noted within a population was due to different muscle activation patterns, or the tasks being performed differently, or other variables such as skin impedance, or the stochastic nature of electromyography.\n\nEMG signals were recorded during hand-wrist tasks selected to elicit MVCs in the muscles of the forearm - pull up, push down, radial pull, ulnar pull, pull, pronation, finger flexion, finger extension, and grip - as well as two activities of daily living - pouring a glass of water from a jug and turning a key in a lock. A load cell mounted to a statically mounted handle was used to record contemporaneously the forces and moments exerted by participants in pull up, push down, radial pull, ulnar pull, pull, pronation, finger flexion, and finger extension tasks.\n\nNinety percent of tasks yielded the expected load cell outputs for the directed tasks and thus were considered as having been performed correctly. The tasks performed incorrectly were not the same for all participants, nor were they all performed by the same participants. Of note was that there were instances when a task was performed incorrectly but still an expected MVC was achieved. The EMG signals showed similar variation to that seen in previous studies. However, the applied forces and moments did not appear to explain the variation seen in the tasks that elicited MVCs.\n\nThe results of this study indicate that different muscle activation patterns may be used to exert the same force by the hand. Thus, it may not be possible for a given task to elicit MVC in the same muscle in all people. However, by using several activities, MVCs for the forearm muscles may be obtained for most of the population. Beyond designing EMG protocols, the results of this study suggest that people have unique muscle activation patterns and raise questions as to whether this is a result of physiology or conditioning.",

Using the set of 29 complex templates (including a template with SARS-CoV-2 antigen) and 732 specificity records, we built a database of 1585 model structures carrying substitutions in either TCR or TCR{beta} chains with some models representing the result of different mutation pathways for the same final structure. This database allowed us to analyze features of amino acid contacts in TCR:antigen interfaces that govern antigen recognition preferences and interpret these interactions in terms of physicochemical properties of interacting residues. Our results provide a methodology for creating high-quality TCR:antigen:MHC models for antigens of interest that can be utilized to predict TCR specificity.",

Due to their level of complexity, unexpected malfunctioning may lead to a range of pathologies, including various malignant formations. One promising way to improve the understanding of malignant transformation is to study the underlying gene regulatory networks (GRNs) associated with cell development and differentiation. Evaluation and inference of the GRN structure from gene expression data is a challenging task in systems biology: recent achievements in single-cell (SC) transcriptomics allow the generation of SC gene expression data, which can be used to sharpen the knowledge on GRN structure. In order to understand whether a particular network of three key gene regulators (BCL6, IRF4, BLIMP1), influenced by two external stimuli signals (surface receptors BCR and CD40), is able to describe GC B cell differentiation, we used a stochastic model to fit SC transcriptomic data from a human lymphoid organ dataset. The model is defined mathematically as a piecewise-deterministic Markov process. We showed that after parameter tuning, the model qualitatively recapitulates mRNA distributions corresponding to GC and plasmablast stages of B cell differentiation. Thus, the model can assist in validating the GRN structure and, in the future, could lead to better understanding of the different types of dysfunction of the regulatory mechanisms.",

A key shortcoming of current approaches is their extremely limited ability to share information across related but non-identical reads. Consequently, they cannot make effective use of sequencing data, nor can they be directly applied in many settings of interest. We introduce model-based enrichment (MBE) to overcome this shortcoming. MBE is based on sound theoretical principles, is easy to implement, and can trivially make use of advances in modernday machine learning classification architectures or related innovations. We extensively evaluate MBE empirically, both in simulation and on real data.

    "abstract": "DNA naturally exists in a solvent environment, comprised of water and salt molecules such as sodium, potassium, magnesium, etc. Along with the sequence, the solvent conditions become a vital factor determining DNA structure and thus its conductance. Over the last two decades, researchers have measured DNA conductivity both in hydrated and almost dry (dehydrated) conditions. However, due to experimental limitations (the precise control of the environment), it is very difficult to analyze the conductance results in terms of individual contributions of the environment. Therefore, modeling studies can help us to gain a valuable understanding of various factors playing a role in charge transport phenomena. DNA naturally has negative charges located at the phosphate groups in the backbone, which provides both the connections between the base pairs and the structural support for the double helix. Positively charged ions such as the Sodiumion (Na+), one of the most commonly used counterions, balance the negative charges at the backbone. This modeling study investigates the role of counterions both with and without the solvent (water) environment on charge transport through double-stranded DNA. Our computational experiments show that in dry DNA, the presence of counterions affects electron transmission at the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energies. However, in solution, the counterions have a negligible role in transmission. Using the polarizable continuum model calculations, we demonstrate that the transmission is significantly higher at both the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energies in a water environment as opposed to in a dry one. Moreover, calculations also show that the energy levels of neighboring bases are more closely aligned to ease electron flow in the solution.",

While the radiological damage from U is rather well understood, less is known about the chemical damage mechanisms, which dominate in DU. Heavy metal exposure is associated with numerous health conditions including Alzheimers disease (AD), the most prevalent age-related cause of dementia. The pathological hallmark of AD is deposition of amyloid plaques, consisting mainly of amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) peptides aggregated into amyloid fibrils in the brain. However, the toxic species in AD are likely oligomeric A{beta} aggregates. Exposure to heavy metals such as Cd, Hg, Mn, and Pb is known to increase A{beta} production, and these metals bind to A{beta} peptides and modulate their aggregation. Possible effects of U in AD pathology have been sparsely studied. Here, we use biophysical techniques to study in vitro interactions between A{beta} peptides and uranyl ions, UO22+, of DU. We show for the first time that uranyl ions bind to A{beta} peptides with affinities in the micromolar range, induce structural changes in A{beta} monomers and oligomers, and inhibit A{beta} fibrillization. General toxic mechanisms of uranyl ions could be modulation of protein folding, misfolding, and aggregation.",

Here, we investigated candidate driver genes of the highly aggressive basal-like/squamous molecular subtype of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Integrative transcriptomic analyses identified the upregulated serine/cysteine protease inhibitor, SERPINB3 (squamous cell carcinoma antigen 1, SCCA1) in basal-like/squamous PDAC using discovery and validation approaches. Upregulation of SERPINB3 associated with decreased patient survival and a transcriptome profile indicative of the basal-like/squamous subtype. In human PDAC cell lines, SERPINB3 transgene expression enhanced their invasion capability. Moreover, upregulated expression of SERPINB3 in AsPC-1 cells resulted in enhanced lung metastasis in an orthotopic xenograft model. Molecular analysis of the primary tumor xenografts indicated activation of pathways related to metastasis, increased oxidative damage, and angiogenesis when SERPINB3 was upregulated. Furthermore, metabolomic analysis, using patient cohorts and PDAC cell lines showed a distinct metabolic pattern closely associated with both SERPINB3 and the basal-like/squamous subtype, which included upregulation of carnitine/acylcarnitine, amino acid, glutathione, and purine metabolic pathways, and glycolysis. Further RNA-seq and metabolomic analyses indicated that SERPINB3 may potentially induce the basal-like/squamous subtype and metabolic reprogramming through MYC activation.

    "abstract": "Plant cells lack centrosomes and instead utilise acentrosomal microtubule organising centres (MTOCs) to rapidly increase the number of microtubules at the onset of spindle assembly. Although several proteins required for MTOC formation have been identified, how the MTOC is positioned at the right place is not known. Here, we show that the inner nuclear membrane protein SUN2 is required for MTOC association with the nuclear envelope (NE) during mitotic prophase in the moss Physcomitrium patens. In actively dividing protonemal cells, microtubules accumulate around the NE during prophase. In particular, regional MTOC is formed at the apical surface of the nucleus. However, microtubule accumulation around the NE was impaired and apical MTOCs were mislocalised in sun2 knockout (KO) cells. In addition, chromosome distribution in the nucleus was skewed, suggesting that SUN2 mediates the linking of microtubules with chromosomes. Upon nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD), the mitotic spindle was assembled with mislocalised MTOC, which were a source of microtubules in sun2 KO plants. However, completion of chromosome alignment in the spindle was delayed; in severe cases, the chromosome was transiently detached from the spindle body. SUN2 tended to localise to the apical surface of the nucleus during prophase in a microtubule-dependent manner. Based on these results, we propose that SUN2 facilitates the attachment of microtubules to chromosomes during spindle assembly by linking them prior to NEBD. Furthermore, this study suggests that trans-NE microtubule-chromosome linking, a well-known function of SUN in animals and yeast, is conserved in plants.",

    "abstract": "SummaryCardiac lymphatic vessels play important roles in fluid homeostasis, inflammation, disease, and regeneration of the heart. The developing cardiac lymphatics in human fetal hearts are closely associated with coronary arteries, similar to those in zebrafish hearts. We identified a population of cardiac lymphatic endothelial cells that reside in the epicardium. Single nuclei multiomic analysis of the human fetal heart revealed the plasticity and heterogeneity of the cardiac endothelium. Furthermore, we found that VEGFC is highly expressed in arterial endothelial cells, providing a molecular basis for the arterial association of cardiac lymphatic development. Using a cell-type-specific integrative analysis, we identified a novel population of cardiac lymphatic endothelial cells marked by the PROX1, the lymphangiocrine RELN, and enriched in binding motifs of ETV transcriptional factors. We report the first in vivo molecular characterization of human cardiac lymphatics and provide a valuable resource to understand fetal heart development.",

    "abstract": "Plant species richness is influenced by complex interactions between biotic and abiotic factors that operate on different spatial scales. Since spatial scales vary continuously in nature, it is expected that multiple factors simultaneously affect species richness and composition at an intermediate spatial scale (i.e., the mesoscale landscape level). Previous studies have shown that local topography and elevation are important factors for shaping mesoscale landscape-level plant species richness; however, the relative importance of these factors has rarely been examined. Here, we used spatially explicit woody plant survey data to investigate the relative importance of topography, elevation, and disturbance at the mesoscale landscape level. We found that topography and elevation are important drivers of plant species richness and composition at the mesoscale landscape level and affect different components (i.e., the number of species and species composition, respectively). Our study also found that closely-related species coexisted along the elevational gradient, suggesting that niche partitioning among closely-related species is a fundamentally important feature of mesoscale species richness pattern. Furthermore, we found that specialization in a habitat of closely-related species can be established even within a limited environmental gradient. This suggests that biotic interactions among closely-related species may be an important factor driving habitat specialization, and biotic interactions may play an important role in shaping landscape-scale biodiversity patterns.",

    "abstract": "Models of both sex chromosome evolution and the genetic basis of local adaptation suggest that selection acts to lock beneficial combinations of alleles together in regions of reduced or suppressed recombination. Drawing inspiration from such models, we apply similar logic to investigate whether an autosomal supergene underlying colony social organization in ants expanded to include \"socially antagonistic\" alleles. We tested this premise in a Formica ant species wherein we identified four supergene haplotypes on chromosome 3 underlying colony social organization and sex ratio. Remarkably, we discovered a novel rearranged supergene variant (9r) on chromosome 9 underlying queen miniaturization. The 9r is tightly linked to one of the haplotypes (P2) on chromosome 3, found predominantly in multi-queen (polygyne) colonies. We suggest that queen miniaturization is strongly disfavored in the single queen (monogyne) background, and thus socially antagonistic. As such, divergent selection experienced by ants living in alternative social  environments (monogyne and polygyne) may have contributed to the emergence of a genetic polymorphism on chromosome 9 and associated queen size dimorphism. Consequently, an ancestral polygyne-associated haplotype may have expanded to include the polymorphism on chromosome 9, resulting in a larger region of suppressed recombination spanning two chromosomes. This process is analogous to the formation of neo-sex chromosomes and consistent with models of expanding regions of suppressed recombination. We also propose that miniaturized queens, 16-20% smaller than queens without 9r, could be incipient intraspecific social parasites.\n\nSignificance statementWhen sets of gene variants work well together, selection may lead to a reduction in recombination between them. Here, we discover a novel supergene region on chromosome 9 that controls a previously undescribed queen size polymorphism in Formica cinerea ants. The haplotype that is found in small queens, 9r, is tightly linked to a supergene haplotype on chromosome 3 that is found in multi-queen colonies. We propose that the region of suppressed recombination expanded to include both chromosome 3 and chromosome 9 because small queens could be successful in the multi-queen but not in the single-queen environment.",

    "abstract": "Advances in single-cell sequencing technologies have provided novel insights into the dynamics of gene expression throughout development, been used to characterize somatic variation and heterogeneity within tissues, and are currently enabling the construction of transcriptomic cell atlases. However, despite these remarkable advances, linking anatomical information to transcriptomic data and positively identifying the cell types that correspond to gene expression clusters in single-cell sequencing data sets remains a challenge. We describe a straightforward genetic barcoding approach that takes advantage of the powerful genetic tools available in Drosophila to allow in vivo tagging of defined cell populations. This method, called Targeted Genetically-Encoded Multiplexing (TaG-EM), involves inserting a DNA barcode just upstream of the polyadenylation site in a Gal4-inducible UAS-GFP construct so that the barcode sequence can be read out during single-cell sequencing, labeling a cell population of interest. By creating many such independently barcoded fly strains, TaG-EM will enable a number of potential applications that will improve the quality and information content of single-cell transcriptomic data including positive identification of cell types in cell atlas projects, identification of multiplet droplets, and barcoding of experimental timepoints, conditions, and replicates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the barcodes from TaG-EM fly lines can be read out using next-generation sequencing to facilitate population-scale behavioral measurements. Thus, TaG-EM has the potential to enable large-scale behavioral screens in addition to improving the ability to reliably annotate cell atlas data, expanding the scope, and improving the robustness of single-cell transcriptomic experiments.",

    "abstract": "Pinpointing genetic impacts on DNA methylation can improve our understanding of pathways that underlie gene regulation and disease risk. We report heritability and methylation quantitative trait locus (meQTL) analysis at 724,499 CpGs profiled with the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC array in 2,358 blood samples from three UK cohorts, with replication. Methylation levels at 34.2% of CpGs were affected by SNPs, and 98% of effects were cis-acting or within 1 Mbp of the tested CpG. Our results are consistent with meQTL analyses based on the former Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 array. Both meQTL SNPs and CpGs with meQTLs were overrepresented in enhancers, which have improved coverage on this platform compared to previous approaches. Co-localisation analyses across genetic effects on DNA methylation and 56 human traits identified 1,520 co-localisations across 1,325 unique CpGs and 34 phenotypes, including in disease-relevant genes, such ICOSLG (inflammatory bowel disease), and USP1 and DOCK7 (total cholesterol levels). Enrichment analysis of meQTLs and integration with expression QTLs gave insights into mechanisms underlying cis-meQTLs, for example through disruption of transcription factor binding sites for CTCF and SMC3, and trans-meQTLs, for example through regulating the expression of ACD and SENP7 which can modulate DNA methylation at distal sites. Our findings improve the characterisation of the mechanisms underlying DNA methylation variability and are informative for prioritisation of GWAS variants for functional follow-ups.

While it is known from human cases and animal models that CD4+ T-cells play a role in curbing Cryptosporidium, the role of CD8+ cells remains to be defined. Using a Cryptosporidium tyzzeri mouse model, we show that gut-resident CD8+ intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) confer resistance to parasite growth. CD8+ IELs express, and are dependent on, the ligand-dependent transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). AHR deficiency reduced CD8+ IELs, decreased their cytotoxicity, and worsened infection. Transfer of CD8+ IELs rescued severely immunodeficient mice from death following Cryptosporidium challenge. Finally, dietary supplementation of the AHR pro-ligand indole-3-carbinol to new-born mice promoted resistance to infection. Therefore, common dietary metabolites augment the host immune response to cryptosporidiosis, protecting against disease.",

    "abstract": "Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS) is an inflammatory condition of the paranasal sinus mucosa. Despite being a common health issue, the exact cause of CRS is yet to be understood. However, research suggests that Staphylococcus aureus, particularly in the biofilm form, drives the disease. This study aimed to investigate the impact of long-term exposure to secreted factors of Staphylococcus aureus biofilm (SABSF), harvested from clinical isolates of non-CRS carriers and CRS patients, on the nasal mucosa in a rat model.\n\nWistar rats were randomised (n=5/group) to receive daily intranasal instillations of 40 L (200 g/L) SABSF for 28 days or vehicle control with S. aureus isolated from the sinuses of a non-CRS carrier, a type 2 endotype CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) patient, and a non-type 2 endotype CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) patient. The sinonasal samples of the rats were then analysed through histopathology and transcriptome profiling.\n\nThe results showed that all three intervention groups displayed significant lymphocytic infiltration (p[&le;]0.05). However, only the SABSF collected from the CRSwNP patient caused significant mucosal damage, mast cell infiltration, and goblet cell hyperplasia compared to the control. The transcriptomics results indicated that SABSF significantly enriched multiple inflammatory pathways and showed distinct transcriptional expression differences between the control group and the SABSF collected from CRS patients (p[&le;]0.05). Additionally, the SABSF challenges induced the expression of IgA and IgG but not IgE.\n\nIn conclusion, this in vivo study indicates that long-term exposure to SABSF leads to an inflammatory response in the nasal mucosa with increased severity for S. aureus isolated from a CRSwNP patient. The findings of this study shed light on the role of S. aureus in the development of CRS and could inform future research and treatment efforts.",

With this platform, we implemented a dynamic single-cell screening for compounds that induce a phenotypic change while decreasing cell-to-cell variation, aiming to undermine the bacterial population, making it more vulnerable to other drugs. We first applied this strategy to mycobacteria, as tuberculosis poses a major public-health threat.

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) has a complex cell wall, largely composed of mycolic acids and long-chain fatty acids that play a crucial role in maintaining its integrity and permeability. This complex lipid structure has a role in abrogating the process of phagosome-lysosome fusion and infection establishment. The M. tb desaturase A1 (DesA1) catalyzes the introduction of position-specific double bonds, a key step in the biosynthesis of a diverse range of mycolic acids. We have previously demonstrated that M. tb DesA1 is a Ca2+-binding protein, belonging to the extended {beta}{gamma}-crystallin superfamily. Using a combination of biophysical and genetic approaches, we investigated the structural and functional significance of Ca2+ binding on DesA1 activity. A protein unfolding assay of the protein in the presence and absence of Ca2+ shows that Ca2+ binding imparts structural stability to DesA1. To identify the role of Ca2+, we introduced mutations at key residues in the identified Ca2+-binding motif of DesA1 and generated F303A, E304Q, and F303A-E304Q variants of DesA1. We identified F303 as a hot point which disables the protein for Ca2+ binding. Two other mutations E304Q and F303A-E304Q showed reduced Ca2+ binding. Complementation of a conditionally complemented desA1 deletion mutant strain of Mycobacterium smegmatis with these mutants, either failed to complement its growth phenotype or led to a compromise in complementation. In addition, the F303A and F303A-E304Q complements exhibit increased sensitivity to isoniazid, a first-line anti-tubercular drug, pointing to a cell wall permeability defect in these strains. Our findings highlight the critical importance of Ca2+ in the functioning of DesA1 and its implicit role in the maintenance of mycobacterial cellular integrity.",

Our results show that the other splicing modifiers interact with the intermolecular RNA helix epitope containing an unpaired adenine within a G-2A-1G+1U+2 motif, which is essential for their biological activity. We also determined structural models of risdiplam, SMN-CX, and branaplam bound to RNA, and solved the solution structure of the most divergent SMN2 splicing modifier, SMN-CY, in complex with the RNA helix. These findings not only deepen our understanding of the chemical diversity of splicing modifiers that target A-1 bulged 5-splice sites, but also identify common pharmacophores required for modulating 5-splice site selection with small molecules.",

    "abstract": "A screen of 61 compounds identified bexarotene and sorafenib as inhibitors of bacterial isolates that grew on LB agar but not on McConkey agar. The effect of bexarotene was durable, whereas sorafenib simply retarded growth. Two sorafenib analogues, previously not described, dubbed JSR-A40 and JSR-N42, displayed durable effects. Upon extending this to a larger group of bacteria from different sources it was found that both bexarotene and JSR-N42 were active in concentrations from between 1.25-10 {micro}M in 42 of bacteria growing in LB but not McConkey medium, whereas bacteria growing on McConkey agar were all found to be insensitive at that concentration. Both bexarotene and N42 displayed rather broad characteristics similar to clindamycin, however non-overlapping. Sensitivity to clindamycin, if observed, was generally higher. It was found that the urea type compound N42 at 5 {micro}M was broader active than clindamycin at 5 {micro}M in this set of isolates.",

    "abstract": "Embryos are regeneration and wound healing masters. They not only rapidly close their wounds, remodel injured tissue without a scar, but also regenerate body parts. Many animal models with variable regenerative capabilities have already been studied. Additionally, with the introduction of high throughput techniques, novel regeneration mechanisms including genes and signaling pathways, and specialized cell types required for regeneration control in spatial and temporal aspects have been identified. Until now our knowledge has been limited to primarily the late phases of regeneration (> 1 day post injury). In this paper, we reveal the critical steps for regeneration initiation. We have discovered Regeneration Initiating Cells (RICs) using single cell and spatial transcriptomic analyses during tail regeneration in Xenopus laevis. RICs are formed transiently from the basal epidermal cells and are critical for the modification of the surrounding extracellular matrix to allow for migration of other cell types such as regeneration organizing cells that further promote regeneration. Absence or deregulation of RICs leads to excessive extracellular matrix deposition and regeneration defects.",

    "abstract": "Plant associated microbiomes have a large impact on the fitness of the plants in the particular environmental conditions. The root associated microbiomes are shaped by the interactions between the microbial community members, their plant host, and environmental factors. Hence, further understanding of the composition and functions of the plant root associated microbiomes can pave the way for the development of more effective conservation strategies for endangered endemic plants. Here, we characterized the bacterial and fungal microbiomes in bulk and rhizosphere soil of an endemic and a non-endemic Thymus species from Kazdagi National Park, Turkiye, Thymus pulvinatus and Thymus longicaulis subsp. chaubardii, respectively, by 16S rRNA gene and ITS amplicon sequencing. Our findings revealed no significant differences in alpha diversity between plant species and soil types. However, we found that the bacterial microbiome profiles differentiate not only Thymus species but also soil types while fungal microbiome profiles show distinct profiles particularly between the species in beta diversity. Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Chloroflexi members form the core bacterial microbiome while the fungal core microbiome consists of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota members in both Thymus species. Moreover, we identified the association of the bacterial taxa contributing to the biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nitrogen and providing the stress resistance with the rhizosphere soil of endemic T. pulvinatus. In addition, functional predictions suggested distinct enriched functions in rhizosphere soil samples of the two plant species. Also, employing an exploratory integrative analysis approach, we determined the plant species-specific nature of transkingdom interactions in two Thymus species.",

SSRIDDs are associated with the BAF (Brahma-Related Gene-1 Associated Factor) complex, whereas CdLS is a disorder of chromatin modification associated with the cohesin complex. Here, we used RNA interference in Drosophila melanogaster to reduce expression of six genes (brm, osa, Snrl, SMC1, SMC3, vtd) orthologous to human genes associated with SSRIDDs and CdLS. These fly models exhibit changes in sleep, activity, startle behavior (a proxy for sensorimotor integration) and brain morphology. Whole genome RNA sequencing identified 9,657 differentially expressed genes (FDR < 0.05), 156 of which are differentially expressed in both sexes in SSRIDD- and CdLS-specific analyses, including Bap60, which is orthologous to SMARCD1, a SSRIDD-associated BAF component, k-means clustering reveals genes co-regulated within and across SSRIDD and CdLS fly models. RNAi-mediated reduction of expression of six genes co-regulated with focal genes brm, osa, and/or Snrl recapitulated changes in behavior of the focal genes. Based on the assumption that fundamental biological processes are evolutionarily conserved, Drosophila models can be used to understand underlying molecular effects of variants in chromatin-modification pathways and may aid in discovery of drugs that ameliorate deleterious phenotypic effects.",

    "abstract": "Development of the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, is regulated by a limited number of sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs). However, the mechanisms by which these TFs recognize genome-wide binding sites is still largely unknown. To address TF specificity, we investigated the binding of two TF subsets that either bind CACACA or GTGCAC DNA sequence motifs and further characterized PfAP2-G and PfAP2-EXP which bind unique DNA motifs (GTAC and TGCATGCA). We interrogated the impact of DNA sequence and chromatin context on P. falciparum TF binding by integrating high-throughput in vitro and in vivo binding assays, DNA shape predictions, epigenetic post-translational modifications, and chromatin accessibility. We determined that DNA sequence context minimally impacts binding site selection for CACACA-binding TFs, while chromatin accessibility, epigenetic patterns, co-factor recruitment, and dimerization contribute to differential binding. In contrast, GTGCAC-binding TFs prefer different DNA sequence context in addition to chromatin dynamics. Finally, we find that TFs that preferentially bind divergent DNA motifs may bind overlapping genomic regions in vivo due to low-affinity binding to other sequence motifs. Our results demonstrate that TF binding site selection relies on a combination of DNA sequence and chromatin features, thereby contributing to the complexity of P. falciparum gene regulatory mechanisms.\n\nKey PointsO_LISequence and chromatin context determine differential DNA-binding specificity of P. falciparum TFs\nC_LIO_LITFs with paralogous DNA-binding domains in P. falciparum are not functionally redundant\nC_LIO_LITFs with differing sequence-specificity can co-occupy sites through low-affinity DNA interactions\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Treatment of tuberculosis continues to be challenging due to the widespread latent form of the disease and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of the pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Bacterial ribosomes are a common and effective target for antibiotics. Several second line anti-tuberculosis drugs, e.g. kanamycin, amikacin, and capreomycin, target ribosomal RNA to inhibit protein synthesis. However, M. tuberculosis can acquire resistance to these drugs, emphasizing the need to identify new drug targets. Previous cryo-EM structures of the M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis ribosomes identified two novel ribosomal proteins, bS22 and bL37, in the vicinity of two crucial drug-binding sites: the mRNA-decoding center on the small (30S), and the peptidyl-transferase center on the large (50S) ribosomal subunits, respectively. The functional significance of these two small proteins is unknown. In this study, we observe that an M. smegmatis strain lacking the bs22 gene shows enhanced susceptibility to kanamycin compared to the wild-type strain. Cryo-EM structures of the ribosomes lacking bS22 in the presence and absence of kanamycin suggest a direct role of bS22 in modulating the 16S rRNA kanamycin-binding site. Our structures suggest that amino-acid residue Lys-16 of bS22 interacts directly with the phosphate backbone of helix 44 of 16S rRNA to influence the micro-configuration of the kanamycin-binding pocket. Our analysis shows that similar interactions occur between eukaryotic homologues of bS22, and their corresponding rRNAs, pointing to a common mechanism of aminoglycoside resistance in higher organisms.",

In humans, H2B monoubiquitination is catalyzed by the heterodimeric Bre1 complex composed of Bre1A/RNF20 and Bre1B/RNF40. The Bre1 proteins generally function as tumor suppressors, while in certain cancers, they facilitate cancer cell proliferation. To reveal the structural basis of H2BK120 ubiquitination and its regulation, we determined the cryo-EM structure of the human Bre1 complex bound to the nucleosome. The two RING domains of Bre1A and Bre1B recognize the acidic patch and the nucleosomal DNA phosphates around SHL 6.0, which are ideally located to recruit the E2 enzyme and ubiquitin for H2BK120-specific ubiquitination. Mutational experiments suggest that the two RING domains bind in both orientations and that ubiquitination occurs when Bre1A binds to the acidic patch. Our results provide insights into the relationships between Bre1 proteins and cancer and suggest that H2B monoubiquitination can be regulated by nuclesomal DNA flexibility.",

    "abstract": "Loss-of-function mutations in the human PINK1 kinase (hPINK1) are causative of early-onset Parkinsons disease (PD). Activation of hPINK1 induces phosphorylated ubiquitin to initiate removal of damaged mitochondria by autophagy. Previously we solved the structure of the insect PINK1 orthologue, Tribolium castaneum PINK1, and showed that autophosphorylation of Ser205 was critical for ubiquitin interaction and phosphorylation (Kumar, Tamjar, Waddell et al., 2017). In this advance, we report new findings on the regulation of hPINK1 by phosphorylation. We reconstitute E. coli expressed hPINK1 activity in vitro by direct incorporation of phosphoserine at the equivalent site Serine 228 (pSer228), providing direct evidence for a role for Ser228 phosphorylation in hPINK1 activation. Furthermore, using mass spectrometry, we identify six novel Ser/Thr autophosphorylation sites including regulatory Serine167 phosphorylation (pSer167), which in addition to pSer228 is required for ubiquitin recognition and phosphorylation. Strikingly, we also detect phosphorylation of a conserved Cysteine412 (pCys412) residue in the hPINK1 activation segment. Structural modelling suggests that pCys412 inhibits ubiquitin recognition and we demonstrate that mutation of Cys412 to Ala renders hPINK1 more active towards ubiquitin when expressed in human cells. These results outline new insights into hPINK1 activation by pSer167 and pSer228 and a novel inhibitory mechanism mediated by pCys412. These findings will aid in the development of small molecule activators of hPINK1.",

Being able to account for the effect of genetic variation on the proteome holds great promises towards this goal. However, identifying the protein products of genetic variation using mass spectrometry has proven very challenging. Here we show that the identification of variant peptides can be improved by the integration of retention time and fragmentation predictors into a unified proteogenomic pipeline. By combining these intrinsic peptide characteristics using the search-engine post-processor Percolator, we demonstrate improved discrimination power between correct and incorrect peptide-spectrum matches. Our results demonstrate that the drop in performance that is induced when expanding a protein sequence database can be compensated, and hence enabling efficient identification of genetic variation products in proteomics data. We anticipate that this enhancement of proteogenomic pipelines can provide a more refined picture of the unique proteome of patients, and thereby contribute to improving patient care.",

    "abstract": "Monitoring of DNA-protein interactions is essential in understanding many biological processes. Proteins must find their target site on a DNA molecule to perform their function, and the mechanisms for target search differ across proteins. Revealing temporal interactions with two target sites, both in Cis and in Trans, is crucial in target search mechanisms studies. Here, we present two single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET)-based assays to study BfiI-DNA interactions. The first assay, smFRET-based DNA looping assay, detects both \"Phi\" and \"U\"-shaped DNA looping events. We modified it to only allow in Trans BfiI-target DNA interactions to improve specificity and reduce limitations in the observation time. Our TIRF microscopy measurements directly observe the on- and off-target binding events and characterize BfiI binding events. Our results show that BfiI binding events last longer on target sites and that the BfiI rarely changes conformations during binding. This newly developed assay could be useful for other two-targets-binding DNA-interacting proteins and could be employed for dsDNA substrate BfiI-PAINT, which is useful for DNA stretch-assays and other super-resolution fluorescence microscopy studies.",

    "abstract": "An imbalance in the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pool caused by an increase or decrease in the levels of any of the four dNTPs leads to increased DNA mutations, overloading DNA repair mechanisms. The human protein SAMHD1 (Sterile alpha motif and histidine-aspartate domain containing protein 1) functions as a dNTPase to maintain the balance of the dNTP pool, as well as in DNA repair. In eukaryotes, the limiting step in de novo dNTP synthesis is catalyzed by RIBONUCLEOTIDE REDUCTASE (RNR), which consists of two R1 and two R2 subunits. In Arabidopsis, RNR1 is encoded by CRINKLED LEAVES 8 (CLS8) and RNR2 by three paralogous genes, including TSO2 (TSO MEANING UGLY IN CHINESE 2). In plants, the de novo biosynthesis of purines occurs within the chloroplast, and DOV1 (DIFFERENTIAL DEVELOPMENT OF VASCULAR ASSOCIATED CELLS 1) catalyzes the first step of this pathway. Here, to explore the role of VENOSA4 (VEN4), the most likely Arabidopsis ortholog of human SAMHD1, we studied the ven4-0 mutant. The mutant leaf phenotype caused by the ven4-0 point mutation was stronger than those of T-DNA insertional ven4 mutations. Structural predictions suggested that the E249L amino acid substitution in the mutated VEN4-0 protein rigidifies its 3D structure compared to wild-type VEN4. The morphological phenotypes of the ven4, cls8, and dov1 single mutants were similar, and those of the ven4 tso2 and ven4 dov1 double mutants were synergistic. The ven4-0 mutant had reduced levels of four amino acids related to dNTP biosynthesis, including glutamine and glycine, which are precursors in the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway. Finally, despite its annotation in some databases, At5g40290, a paralog of VEN4, is likely a pseudogene. These observations support the previously proposed role of VEN4 in dNTP metabolism. Our results reveal a high degree of cross-kingdom functional conservation between VEN4 and SAMHD1 in dNTP homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) in the bovine is one of the most predominant chronic debilitating infectious diseases primarily caused by Mycobacterium bovis. Besides, the incidence of TB in humans due to M. bovis, and that in bovines due to M. tuberculosis-indicates cattle as a major reservoir of zoonotic TB. While India accounts for the highest global burden of both TB and multidrug-resistant TB in humans, systematic evaluation of bovine TB (bTB) prevalence in India is largely lacking. Recent reports emphasized markedly greater bTB prevalence in exotic and crossbred cattle compared to indigenous cattle breeds that represent more than one-third of the total cattle population in India, which is the largest globally. This study aimed at elucidating the immune responses underlying the differential bTB incidence in prominent indigenous (Sahiwal), and crossbred (Sahiwal x Holstein Friesian) cattle reared in India. Employing the standard Single Intradermal Tuberculin Test (SITT), and mycobacterial gene-targeting single as well as multiplex-PCR-based screening revealed higher incidences of bovine tuberculin reactors as well as Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex specific PCR positivity amongst the crossbred cattle. Further, ex vivo mycobacterial infection in cultures of bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from SITT, and myco-PCR negative healthy cattle exhibited significantly higher intracellular growth of M. bovis BCG, and M. tuberculosis H37Ra in the crossbred cattle PBMCs compared to native cattle. In addition, native cattle PBMCs induced higher pro-inflammatory cytokines and signaling pathways, such as interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}), interleukin-17 (IL-17), and tank binding kinase-1 (TBK-1) upon exposure to live mycobacterial infection in comparison to PBMCs from crossbred cattle that exhibited higher expression of IL-1{beta} transcripts. Together, these findings highlight that differences in the innate immune responses of these cattle breeds might be contributing to the differential susceptibility to TB infection, and the resultant disparity in bTB incidence amongst indigenous, and crossbred cattle.",

    "abstract": "Van Gogh-like 2 (Vangl2), a core planar cell polarity (PCP) component, plays an important role in polarized cellular and tissue morphology induction, growth development and cancer. However, its role in regulating inflammatory responses remains elusive. Here, we report that Vangl2 is upregulated in patients with sepsis and identify Vangl2 as a negative regulator of NF-{kappa}B signaling by regulating the protein stability and activation of the core transcription component p65. Mice with myeloid-specific deletion of Vangl2 (Vangl2{Delta}M) are hypersusceptible to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic shock. Vangl2 deficient myeloid cells exhibit enhanced phosphorylation and expression of p65, therefore, promoting the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines after LPS stimulation. Mechanistically, NF-{kappa}B signaling-induced-Vangl2 recruits E3 ubiquitin ligase PDLIM2 to catalyze K63-linked ubiquitination on p65, which serves as a recognition signal for cargo receptor NDP52-mediated selective autophagic degradation. Taken together, these findings demonstrate Vangl2 as a suppressor of NF-{kappa}B mediated inflammation and provide insights into the crosstalk between autophagy and inflammatory diseases.",

Among these, the induction of cell proliferation by antibiotics is critical, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we showed that sulfonyl-containing chemicals (e.g., sulfonamides) can induce cell-proliferation hormesis of Comamonas testosteroni. Investigation of the hormesis mechanism revealed that low-dose sulfonamides bind to the LuxR-type quorum sensing protein LuxR solo, thereby triggering the transcription of 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, a key enzyme of the fatty acid {beta}-oxidation. This provides additional ATP, NADPH, and acetyl-CoA for purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis, allowing cells to synthesize sufficient nucleotides to support rapid cell growth. Our work reports on a previously unknown mechanism for the hormetic effect and highlights its generality in the Comamonadaceae family.",

The mechanism of secretion and the roles of numerous conserved genes within T7SSb gene clusters remain unknown. EsaD is a nuclease toxin secreted by the Staphylococcus aureus T7SSb, which forms a complex with its cognate immunity protein, EsaG, and chaperone EsaE. Encoded upstream of EsaD are three small secreted proteins, EsxB, EsxC and EsxD. Here we show that EsxBCD bind to the transport domain of EsaD and function as EsaD export factors. We report the first structural information for a complete T7SSb substrate pre-secretion complex. Cryo-EM of the EsaDEG trimer and the EsaDEG-EsxBCD hexamer shows that incorporation of EsxBCD confers a conformation comprising a flexible globular cargo domain attached to a long narrow shaft that is likely to be crucial for efficient toxin export.",

In this regard, the role of the spatial organization of the genome on gene expression and vice versa remains practically unexplored. The genome of these parasites is partitioned into core (highly conserved syntenic) and species-specific disruptive regions (synteny disruption), containing multigene families encoding for surface glycoproteins. By mapping genome-wide chromatin interactions we demonstrate that these regions constitute 3D compartments (C and D). These chromatin compartments present significant differences in DNA methylation, nucleosome positioning and chromatin interactions, affecting genome expression dynamics. We show that the genome is organized into chromatin folding domains and transcription is dramatically determined by the local chromatin structure. Our results support a model in which epigenetic mechanisms dramatically impact gene expression in these eukaryotic pathogens.",

RNA G-quadruplexes are important regulatory elements occurring in both coding and non-coding transcripts, yet our knowledge of their structure-based interactions is limited. Here starting from theoretical prediictions, we show experimentally that a large number of chromatin-binding proteins bind to RNA G-quadruplexes and we classify these based on their RNA G-quadruplex-binding potential. Combining experimental identification of nuclear RNA G-quadruplex-binding proteins with computational analysis, we create a prediction tool that can assign probability score for a protein that it binds RNA G-quadruplexes. We show that predicted G-quadruplex RNA-binding proteins exhibit high degree of protein disorder and hydrophilicity, and suggest involvement in both transcription and phase-separation into membrane-less organelles, particularly the nucleolus.

VMap 2.0 contains 195.96 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 2.22 million insertions, and 4.72 million deletions, achieving a high density of variation map in which one variant exists in every 73 base pairs on average. By systematically analyzing the phylogenetic relationships and genetic diversity of tetraploid wheat, hexaploid wheat, and diploid goatgrass (Aegilops tauschii), we found that the genetic diversity of wild emmer wheat was 2.4 times higher than that of common wheat. In contrast, the genetic diversity of diploid goatgrass is 7.8 times higher than the D subgenome of hexaploid wheat. With the high-density genetic variations, VMap 2.0 is anticipated to facilitate high-resolution trait dissection and expedite prediction-based breeding of wheat.",

    "abstract": "Talaromycosis, a severe and invasive fungal infection caused by Talaromyces marneffei, is difficult to treat and impacts those living in endemic regions of southeast Asia, India, and China. While 30% of infections result in mortality, our understanding of the genetic basis of pathogenesis for this fungus is limited. To address this, we apply population genomics and genome wide association study approaches to a cohort of 336 T. marneffei isolates collected from patients who enrolled in the Itraconazole versus Amphotericin B for Talaromycosis (IVAP) trial in Vietnam. We find that isolates from northern and southern Vietnam form two distinct geographical clades, with isolates from southern Vietnam associated with increased disease severity. Leveraging longitudinal isolates, we identify multiple instances of disease relapse linked to unrelated strains, highlighting the potential for multi-strain infections. In more frequent cases of persistent talaromycosis caused by the same strain, we identify variants arising over the course of patient infections that impact genes predicted to function in the regulation of gene expression and secondary metabolite production. By combining genetic variant data with patient metadata for all 336 isolates, we identify pathogen variants significantly associated with multiple clinical phenotypes. In addition, we identify genes and genomic regions under selection across both clades, highlighting loci undergoing rapid evolution, potentially in response to external pressures. With this combination of approaches, we identify links between pathogen genetics and patient outcomes and identify genomic regions that are altered during T. marneffei infection, providing an initial view of how pathogen genetics affects disease outcomes.",

However, technical challenges in membrane protein overexpression, purification, and reconstitution hinder our understanding of lysosome transporter function. Here, we developed a platform to overexpress and purify the putative lysine transporter Ypq1 using a constitutive overexpression system in protease- and ubiquitination-deficient yeast vacuoles. Using this method, we purified and reconstituted Ypq1 into proteoliposomes and showed lysine transport function, supporting its role as a basic amino acid transporter on the vacuole membrane. We also found that the absence of lysine destabilizes purified Ypq1 and causes it to aggregate, consistent with its propensity to be downregulated in vivo upon lysine starvation. Our approach may be useful for the biochemical characterization of many transporters and membrane proteins to understand organellar transport and regulation.",

    "abstract": "The oxidant hydrogen peroxide serves as a signaling molecule that alters many aspects of cardiovascular functions. Recent studies suggest that cytoglobin - a hemoglobin expressed in the vasculature - may promote electron transfer reactions with proposed functions in hydrogen peroxide decomposition. Here, we determined the extent to which cytoglobin regulates intracellular hydrogen peroxide and established mechanisms. We found that cytoglobin decreased the hyperoxidation of peroxiredoxins and maintained the activity of peroxiredoxin 2 following challenge with exogenous hydrogen peroxide. Cytoglobin promoted a reduced intracellular environment and facilitated the reduction of the thiol-based hydrogen peroxide sensor Hyper7 after bolus addition of hydrogen peroxide. Cytoglobin also limited the inhibitory effect of hydrogen peroxide on glycolysis and reversed the oxidative inactivation of the glycolytic enzyme GAPDH. Our results indicate that cytoglobin in cells exists primarily as oxyferrous cytoglobin (CygbFe2+-O2) with its cysteine residues in the reduced form. We found that the specific substitution of one of two cysteine residues on cytoglobin (C83A) inhibited the reductive activity of cytoglobin on Hyper7 and GAPDH. Carotid arteries from cytoglobin knockout mice were more sensitive to glycolytic inhibition by hydrogen peroxide than arteries from wildtype mice. Together, these results support a role for cytoglobin in regulating intracellular redox signals associated with hydrogen peroxide through oxidation of its cysteine residues, independent of hydrogen peroxide reaction at its heme center.",

Consideration of genomic context can provide clues to infer possible enzyme activities for proteins of unknown function.

This cluster lacks a gene encoding a classical family GH31 sulfoquinovosidase candidate, but which instead includes an uncharacterized family GH13 protein (MsGH13) that we hypothesized could be a non-classical sulfoquinovosidase. Surprisingly, recombinant MsGH13 lacks sulfoquinovosidase activity and is a broad spectrum -glucosidase that is active on a diverse array of -linked disaccharides, including: maltose, sucrose, nigerose, trehalose, isomaltose, and kojibiose. Using AlphaFold, a 3D model for the MsGH13 enzyme was constructed that predicted its active site shared close similarity with an -glucosidase from Halomonas sp.

    "abstract": "Gene regulation plays a critical role in the cellular processes that underlie human health and disease. The regulatory relationship between transcription factors (TFs), key regulators of gene expression, and their target genes, the so called TF regulons, can be coupled with computational algorithms to estimate the activity of TFs. However, to interpret these findings accurately, regulons of high reliability and coverage are needed. In this study, we present and evaluate a collection of regulons created using the CollecTRI meta-resource containing signed TF-gene interactions for 1,183 TFs. In this context, we introduce a workflow to integrate information from multiple resources and assign the sign of regulation to TF-gene interactions that could be applied to other comprehensive knowledge bases. We find that the signed CollecTRI-derived regulons outperform other public collections of regulatory interactions in accurately inferring changes in TF activities in perturbation experiments. Furthermore, we showcase the value of the regulons by investigating hallmarks of TF activity profiles inferred from the transcriptomes of three different cancer types. Overall, the CollecTRI-derived TF regulons enable the accurate and comprehensive estimation of TF activities and thereby help to interpret transcriptomics data.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=139 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/534849v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ad6521org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ca8f37org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1808ccdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9c2613_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Microtubule asters are essential in localizing the action of microtubules in processes including mitosis and organelle positioning. In large cells, such as the one-cell sea urchin embryo, aster dynamics are dominated by hydrodynamic pulling forces. However, in systems with more densely positioned nuclei such as the early Drosophila embryo, which packs around 6000 nuclei within the syncytium in a crystalline-like order, it is unclear what processes dominate aster dynamics. Here, we take advantage of a cell cycle regulation Drosophila mutant to generate embryos with multiple asters, independent from nuclei. We use an ex vivo assay to further simplify this biological system to explore the forces generated by and between asters. Through live imaging, drug and optical perturbations, and theoretical modelling, we demonstrate that these asters likely generate an effective pushing force over short distances.\n\nSignificance StatementUsing cytosolic explants from Drosophila syncytial embryos combined with quantitative microscopy and perturbations, de-Carvalho et al., reveal the mechanical forces separating Drosophila microtubule asters. Aster separation drives precise nuclear positioning in multinucleated embryo cells, a vital process for tissue formation and gene expression during subsequent embryo development.",

    "abstract": "APOBEC3 (A3) enzymes deaminate cytosine to uracil in viral single-stranded DNA as a mutagenic barrier for some viruses. A3-induced deaminations can also occur in human genomes resulting in an endogenous source of somatic mutations in multiple cancers. However, the roles of each A3 are unclear since few studies have assessed these enzymes in parallel. Thus, we developed stable cell lines expressing A3A, A3B, or A3H Hap I using non-tumorigenic MCF10A and tumorigenic MCF7 breast epithelial cells, to assess their mutagenic potential and cancer phenotypes in breast cells. The activity of these enzymes was characterized by {gamma}H2AX foci formation and in vitro deamination. Cell migration, and soft agar colony formation assays assessed cellular transformation potential. We found that all three A3 enzymes had similar {gamma}H2AX foci formation, despite different deamination activity in vitro. Notably, in nuclear lysates the in vitro deaminase activity of A3A, A3B, and A3H did not require digestion of cellular RNA, in contrast to A3B and A3H in whole cell lysates. Their similar activities in cells nonetheless resulted in distinct phenotypes where A3A decreased colony formation in soft agar, A3B decreased colony formation in soft agar after hydroxyurea treatment, and A3H Hap I promoted cell migration. Overall, we show that in vitro deamination data does not always reflect in cell deamination, all three A3s induce somatic mutagenesis, and the impact of each is different.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundParkinsons disease (PD) is a progressive late-onset neurodegenerative disease leading to physical and cognitive decline. Mutations of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common genetic cause of PD. LRRK2 is a complex scaffolding protein with known regulatory roles in multiple molecular pathways. Two prominent examples of LRRK2-modulated pathways are Wingless/Int (Wnt) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) signaling. Both are well described key regulators of immune and nervous system development as well as maturation. The aim of this study was to establish the physiological and pathogenic role of LRRK2 in Wnt and NFAT signaling in the brain, as well as the potential contribution of the non-canonical Wnt/Calcium pathway.\n\nMethodsIn vivo cerebral Wnt and NFATc1 signaling activity was quantified in LRRK2 G2019S mutant knock-in (KI) and LRRK2 knockout (KO) male and female mice with repeated measures over 28 weeks, employing lentiviral luciferase biosensors, and analyzed using a mixed-effect model. To establish spatial resolution, we investigated tissues, and primary neuronal cell cultures from different brain regions combining luciferase signaling activity, immunohistochemistry, qPCR and western blot assays. Results were analyzed by unpaired t-test with Welchs correction or 2-way ANOVA with post hoc corrections.\n\nResultsIn vivo Wnt signaling activity in LRRK2 KO and LRRK2 G2019S KI mice was increased significantly [~]3-fold, with a more pronounced effect in males ([~]4-fold) than females ([~]2-fold). NFATc1 signaling was reduced [~]0.5-fold in LRRK2 G2019S KI mice. Brain tissue analysis showed region-specific expression changes in Wnt and NFAT signaling components. These effects were predominantly observed at the protein level in the striatum and cerebral cortex of LRRK2 KI mice. Primary neuronal cell culture analysis showed significant genotype-dependent alterations in Wnt and NFATc1 signaling under basal and stimulated conditions. Wnt and NFATc1 signaling was primarily dysregulated in cortical and hippocampal neurons respectively.\n\nConclusionsOur study further built on knowledge of LRRK2 as a Wnt and NFAT signaling protein. We identified complex changes in neuronal models of LRRK2 PD, suggesting a role for mutant LRRK2 in the dysregulation of NFAT, and canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling.",

    "abstract": "Recently discovered ability of various RNA polymerases (RNAPs) of bacteria and eukaryotes to initiate RNA synthesis with cofactors such as NAD+/NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide). This phenomenon was quickly dubbed \"non-canonical capping\" as the extra 5 moieties of RNA resemble eukaryotic m7G cap superficially. NAD must outcompete abundant ATP, to serve as initiating nucleotide. It is still unclear which physiological conditions permit significant RNA NADylation and to what degree NADylation serves typical functions of a canonical cap in bacteria.\n\nHere we found that the extent of NADyation depends primarily on fidelity of transcription initiation -NAD concentration, specific contacts of RNAP active site with NAD/ATP alternative substrates, and genomic DNA supercoiling. It is much less affected by posttranscriptional processes such as de-capping, processing by main 5-dependent ribonucleases RNaseE and oligoribonuclease. 5-NAD inhibits neither translation of a leaderless 5-NAD-RNA nor a physiological base-pairing of small regulatory NADylated RNA with its antisense target RNA. Translation exposes 5-NAD for de-capping by NudC enzyme.",

    "abstract": "Cranial ganglia are aggregates of sensory neurons that mediate distinct types of sensation. It is little understood how individual neurons coalesce, distribute and shape the ganglion. The statoacoustic ganglion (SAG) displays several lobes spatially arranged to properly connect with hair cells of the inner ear. To investigate the cellular behaviors involved in the 3D organization of the SAG, we use high resolution confocal imaging of single cell labeled zebrafish neuroblasts (NB), photoconversion, photoablation and genetic perturbations. We find that otic NB delaminate out of the otic epithelium in an EMT-like manner, rearranging apical polarity and primary cilia proteins. We also show that, once delaminated, NB migrate directionally and actively, requiring RhoGTPases. Interestingly, cell tracking of individual delaminated NB reveals that NB migrate and coalesce around a small population of pioneer SAG neurons. These pioneer SAG neurons are not from otic placode origin and populate the coalescence region before otic neurogenesis begins. Upon ablation of these cells, migratory pathways of delaminated NB are disrupted and, consequently, SAG shape is affected. Altogether, this work shows for the first time the role of pioneer SAG neurons in orchestrating SAG development.\n\nSummary StatementLittle is known how cranial sensory ganglia organize in 3D. We unveil the repertoire of cellular behaviours underlying statoacoustic morphogenesis and its dependence on relevant pioneer neurons.",

    "abstract": "The human malaria vector Anopheles gambiae is becoming increasingly resistant to insecticides, spurring the development of genetic control strategies. CRISPR-Cas9 gene drives can modify a population by creating double-stranded breaks at highly specific targets, triggering copying of the gene drive into the cut site ( homing), ensuring its inheritance. The DNA repair mechanism responsible requires homology between the donor and recipient chromosomes, presenting challenges for the invasion of lab-developed gene drives into wild populations of target species An. gambiae species complex, which show high levels of genome variation.\n\nTwo gene drives (vas2-5958 and zpg-7280) were introduced into three An. gambiae strains collected across Africa with 5.3-6.6% variation around the target sites, and the effect of this variation on homing was measured. Gene drive homing across different karyotypes of the 2La chromosomal inversion was also assessed. No decrease in gene drive homing was seen despite target site heterology, demonstrating the applicability of gene drives to wild populations.",

    "abstract": "Bradykinin is a peptide implicated in inflammatory pain in both humans and rodents. In rodent sensory neurons, activation of B1 and B2 bradykinin receptors induces neuronal hyperexcitability. Recent evidence suggests that human and rodent dorsal root ganglia (DRG), which contain the cell bodies of sensory neurons, differ in the expression and function of key GPCRs and ion channels; whether BK receptor expression and function are conserved across species has not been studied in depth. In this study, we used human DRG tissue from organ donors to provide a detailed characterization of bradykinin receptor expression and bradykinin-induced changes in the excitability of human sensory neurons. We found that B2 and, to a lesser extent, B1 receptors are expressed by human DRG neurons and satellite glial cells. B2 receptors were enriched in the nociceptor subpopulation. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology, we found that acute bradykinin increases the excitability of human sensory neurons, while prolonged exposure to bradykinin decreases neuronal excitability in a subpopulation of human DRG neurons. Finally, our analyses suggest that donors history of chronic pain and age may be predictors of higher B1 receptor expression in human DRG neurons. Together, these results indicate that acute BK-induced hyperexcitability, first identified in rodents, is conserved in humans and provide further evidence supporting BK signaling as a potential therapeutic target for treating pain in humans.",

    "abstract": "The human Factor VIII (F8) protein is essential for the blood coagulation cascade and specific F8 mutations cause the rare bleeding disorder Hemophilia A (HA). Here, we investigated the impact of HA-causing single-nucleotide mutations on F8 pre-mRNA splicing. We found that 14/97 ([~]14.4%) coding sequence mutations tested in our study induced exon skipping. Splicing patterns of 4/11 ([~]36.4%) F8 exons tested were especially sensitive to the presence of common disease-causing mutations. RNA-chemical probing analyses revealed a three-way junction structure at the 3' end of intron 15 (TWJ-3-15). TWJ-3-15 sequesters the polypyrimidine tract, a key determinant of 3' splice site strength. Using exon-16 of the F8 gene as a model, we designed specific antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that target TWJ-3-15 and identified three that promote the splicing of F8 exon-16. Interaction of TWJ-3-15 with ASOs increases accessibility of the polypyrimidine tract and inhibits the binding of hnRNPA1-dependent splicing silencing factors. Moreover, ASOs targeting TWJ-3-15 rescue diverse splicing-sensitive HA-causing mutations, most of which are distal to the 3 splice site being impacted. The TWJ-3-15 structure and its effect on mRNA splicing provide a model for HA etiology in patients harboring specific F8 mutations and provide a framework for precision RNA-based HA therapies.",
