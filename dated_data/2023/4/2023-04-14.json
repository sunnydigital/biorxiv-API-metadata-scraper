    "abstract": "Obesity is increasing worldwide, particularly in rural communities, where people are likely exposed to high levels of pesticides. We here investigated whether six commonly used agricultural pesticides on corn and soy fields have adipogenic activity and act as obesogens. Exposure to two pesticides, the herbicides acetochlor and metolachlor, induced adipogenesis in vitro in mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. The most potent compound, acetochlor, was selected for further studies in zebrafish. Acetochlor exposure caused morphological malformations and lethality in zebrafish larvae with an EC50 of 7.8 {micro}M and an LC50 of 12 {micro}M. Acetochlor exposure also resulted in lipid accumulation is zebrafish larvae when simultaneously fed a high cholesterol diet. To decipher the molecular mechanisms behind acetochlor action, we preformed transcriptomic and targeted lipidomic analysis of exposed animals. The combined omics results suggested that acetochlor exposure increased Nrf2 activity in response to reactive oxygen species, as well as induced lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. We further discovered that acetochlor structurally shares a chloroacetamide group with known inhibitors of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Computational docking analysis suggested that acetochlor covalently binds to the active site of GPX4. Consequently, Gpx4 activity was efficiently repressed by acetochlor, and lipid peroxidation was increased in zebrafish. We propose that acetochlor disrupts lipid homeostasis by inhibiting Gpx4, resulting in accumulation of lipid peroxidation, 4-hydroxynonenal, and reactive oxygen species in the cells, which in turn activate Nrf2. Because metolachlor, among other acetanilide herbicides, also contain the chloroacetamide group, inhibition of Gpx4 activity may represent a novel, common molecular initiating event of obesogens.\n\nSynopsisRural populations have a high prevalence of metabolic disease and are highly exposed to pesticides. This study reports that the herbicide acetochlor, heavily used on soy and corn fields, inhibits an enzyme that protects from oxidation of lipids in the cell membrane, oxidative stress and a type of cell death called ferroptosis, features that are linked to metabolic disruption and obesity.",

This administration greatly reduces perinatal and neonatal mortality and respiratory distress syndrome associated with prematurity, but preclinical evidence warns for an adverse effect of sGC in the developing brain.\n\nIn this work we evaluated the long-term effects of prenatal exposure to sGC in the brain of 17 years-old adolescents using multimodal MRI. From 4607 birth registrations from Hospital de Braga - Portugal, we selected participants that were born with similar gestational age, but that were either exposed during pregnancy to sGC (n=21) or non-exposed (n=24).

    "abstract": "BackgroundAccumulation of lipid in the liver is the first hallmark of both alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) and non-alcohol-related fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Recent studies indicate that specific mutations in lipid genes confer risk and might influence disease progression to irreversible liver cirrhosis. This study aimed to understand the function/s of lipid risk genes driving disease development in zebrafish genetic models of alcohol- and non-alcohol related fatty liver.\n\nMethodsWe used zebrafish larvae to investigate the effect of alcohol and high fat to model fatty liver and tested the utility of this model to study lipid risk gene functions. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing was used to create knockdowns in 5 days post-fertilization zebrafish larvae for the available orthologs of human cirrhosis risk genes (pnpla3, faf2, tm6sf2). To establish fatty liver models, larvae were exposed to ethanol and a high fat diet (HFD) consisting of chicken egg yolk. Changes in morphology (imaging), survival, liver injury (biochemical tests, histopathology), gene expression (qPCR) and lipid accumulation (dye specific live imaging) were analysed across treatment groups to test the functions of these genes.\n\nResultsExposure of 5-day post-fertilization (dpf) WT larvae to 2% ethanol or HFD for 48 hours developed measurable hepatic steatosis. CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing depleted pnpla3, faf2 and tm6sf2 gene expression in these CRISPR knockdown larvae (crispants). Knockdown significantly increased effects of ethanol and HFD toxicity by increasing hepatic steatosis and hepatic neutrophil recruitment [&ge;]2-fold in all three crispants. Furthermore, ethanol or HFD exposure significantly altered the expression of genes associated with ethanol metabolism (cyp2y3) and lipid metabolism-related gene expression, including atgl (triglyceride hydrolysis), axox1, echs1 (fatty acid {beta}-oxidation), fabp10a (transport), hmgcra (metabolism), notch1 (signaling) and srebp1 (lipid synthesis), in all three pnpla3, faf2 and tm6sf2 crispants. Nile Red staining in all three crispants revealed significantly increased lipid droplet size and triglyceride accumulation in the livers following exposure to ethanol or HFD.\n\nConclusionsWe identified roles for pnpla3, faf2 and tm6sf2 genes in triglyceride accumulation and fatty acid oxidation pathways in a zebrafish larvae model of fatty liver.",

    "abstract": "Terminally differentiated cells are regarded as the most stable and common cell state in adult organisms as they reside in growth arrest and carry out their cellular function. Improving our understanding of the mechanisms involved in promoting cell cycle exit would facilitate our ability to manipulate pluripotent cells into mature tissues for both pharmacological and therapeutic use. Here, we demonstrated that a hyperosmolar environment enforced a protective p53-independent quiescent state in dedifferentiated hepatoma cells and pluripotent stem cells (PSCs)-derived models of human hepatocytes and endothelial cells, representing the endodermal and mesodermal lineages. Prolonged culture in hyperosmolar conditions stimulated transcriptional and functional cell maturation. Interestingly, hyperosmolar conditions did not only trigger cell cycle exit and cellular maturation but were also necessary to maintain this maturated state, as switching back to plasma osmolarity caused the loss of maturation markers and the gain of proliferative markers. Transcriptome analysis revealed activation of NF-{kappa}[V] and repression of WNT signaling as the two main pathways downstream of osmolarity-regulated growth arrest and cell maturation, respectively. This study revealed that increased osmolarity serves as a biochemical signal to promote long-term growth arrest, transcriptional changes, and maturation into different lineages, serving as a practical method to generate differentiated hiPSCs that resemble their mature counterpart more closely.",

    "abstract": "Wnt signaling is involved in the differentiation of eyespot color patterns on the wings of butterflies, but the identity and spatio-temporal regulation of specific Wnt pathway members remains unclear. Here we explore the localization and function of armadillo/{beta}-catenin dependent (canonical) and armadillo/{beta}- catenin independent (non-canonical) Wnt signaling in eyespot development in Bicyclus anynana by localizing Armadillo (Arm), the expression of all seven wnt ligand and four frizzled receptor transcripts present in the genome of this species, and testing the function of arm and frizzled4 using CRISPR-Cas9. During mid to late larval wing development, Arm protein was present in cells at the center of the future eyespots, the foci, and the wing margin, but wnts expressed on the wing, wnt1 (wingless), wnt6, and wnt10 showed expression only some distance away from the foci, along the wing margin. The receptor frizzled9 was expressed in the wing margin and in finger-like projections leading to the foci during early larval wing development, overlapping in expression with Arm. At the same time, the receptor frizzled4 showed a novel expression pattern, anti-localized with Arm, where it is likely transducing non-canonical Wnt signaling. In the early pupal stage, wnt1 was newly expressed in the foci, as previously shown, along with Arm. In addition, frizzled4 and frizzled9-mediated Wnt signaling is likely repressing the expression of frizzled2, as these receptors have anti-colocalized expression domains. Arm had a conserved expression in three other nymphalid butterflies, and functional knockouts of arm and frizzled4 in B. anynana showed that both genes are essential for the differentiation of eyespots. These results show that distinct Wnt signaling pathways are essential for eyespot development in butterflies and are likely interacting to control their active domains.",

Thus, we optimized the rearing conditions for the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, a cnidarian research model to study embryonic and post-metamorphic processes, such as regeneration.\n\nWe adopted a semi-automated aquaculture system for N. vectensis and developed a dietary protocol optimized for the different life stages. Thereby, we increased spawning efficiencies and post-spawning survival rates, and considerably reduced the overall life cycle down to two months. To further improve the obtention of CRISPR-Cas9 mutants, we optimized the design of sgRNAs leading to full KO animals in F0 polyps using a single sgRNA. Finally, we show that NHEJ-mediated transgene insertion is possible in N. vectensis. In sum our study provides additional resources for the scientific community that uses or will use N. vectensis as a research model.\n\nSummary statementOptimized life cycle, in combination with efficient gene-editing approaches facilitates the establishment of genetic tools in N. vectensis, an emerging model for environmental stress response, regeneration, and longevity.",

    "abstract": "Toehold switches are biosensors useful for the detection of endogenous and environmental RNAs. They have been engineered to detect virus RNAs in cell-free gene expression reactions. Their inherent sequence programmability makes engineering a fast and predictable process. Despite improvements in the design, toehold switches suffer from leaky translation in the OFF state, which compromises the fold change and sensitivity of the biosensor. To address this, we constructed and tested signal amplification circuits for three toehold switches triggered by Dengue and Sars-CoV-2 RNAs and an artificial RNA. The serine integrase circuit efficientl contained leakage, boosted the expression fold-change from OFF to ON, and decreased the detection limit of the switches by three to four orders of magnitude. Ultimately, the integrase circuit converted the analog switches signals into digital-like output. The circuit is broadly useful for biosensors and eliminates the hard work of designing and testing multiple switches to find the best possible performer.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=171 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/536885v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f62b1borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@882ad5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b4138eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17001be_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "C-di-GMP is a bacterial second messenger that regulates diverse processes in response to environmental or cellular cues. The nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) CdbA in Myxococcus xanthus binds c-di-GMP and DNA in a mutually exclusive manner in vitro. CdbA is essential for viability, and CdbA depletion causes defects in chromosome organization, leading to a block in cell division and, ultimately, cell death. Most NAPs are not essential; therefore, to explore the paradoxical cdbA essentiality, we isolated suppressor mutations that restored cell viability without CdbA. Most mutations mapped to cdbS, which encodes a stand-alone c-di-GMP binding PilZ domain protein, and caused loss-of-function of cdbS. Cells lacking CdbA and CdbS or only CdbS were fully viable and had no defects in chromosome organization. CdbA depletion caused post-transcriptional upregulation of CdbS accumulation, and this CdbS over-accumulation was sufficient to disrupt chromosome organization and cause cell death. CdbA depletion also caused increased accumulation of CsdK1 and CsdK2, two unusual PilZ-DnaK chaperones. During CdbA depletion, CsdK1 and CsdK2, in turn, stabilized CdbS, thereby enabling its increased accumulation and toxicity. Moreover, we demonstrate that heat stress, possibly involving an increased cellular c-di-GMP concentration, induces the CdbA/CsdK1/CsdK2/CdbA system, causing a CsdK1- and CsdK2-dependent increase in CdbS accumulation. Thereby this system accelerates heat stress-induced chromosome mis-organization and cell death. Collectively, this work describes a unique system that contributes to regulated cell death in M. xanthus and suggests a link between c-di-GMP signaling and regulated cell death in bacteria.\n\nAuthor summaryThe nucleotide-based second messenger c-di-GMP in bacteria controls numerous processes in response to environmental or cellular cues. Typically, these processes are related to lifestyle transitions between motile and sessile behaviors. However, c-di-GMP also regulates other processes. In Myxococcus xanthus, CdbA is a DNA-binding and nucleoid-associated protein that helps to organize the large chromosome. CdbA binds c-di-GMP and DNA in a mutually exclusive manner. While other nucleoid-associated proteins are not essential, CdbA is essential. Here, we show that the crucial function of CdbA is to maintain the level of the c-di-GMP-binding PilZ-domain protein CdbS appropriately low. The CdbS level is not only increased upon depletion of CdbA but also in response to heat stress. Under both conditions, the increased CdbS level perturbs chromosome organization and ultimately causes cell death. The CdbA/CdbS system represents a unique system that contributes to regulated cell death in M. xanthus and suggests a link between c-di-GMP signaling and regulated cell death.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDetection of viruses by host pattern recognition receptors induces the expression of type I interferon (IFN) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which suppress viral replication. Retroviruses such as HIV-1 are subject to sensing by both RNA and DNA sensors, and whether there are any particular features of the viral genome or reverse transcripts that facilitate or enhance this sensing is currently unknown.\n\nResultsWhilst investigating the determinants of innate detection of HIV-1 we noticed that infection of THP-1 cells or primary macrophages with a virus expressing Gag fused to a reporter gene (luciferase or GFP) induced a robust IFN and ISG response that was not observed with an equivalent virus with similar genome length and composition, but expressing wild-type Gag. Innate immune activation by Gag-fusion HIV-1 was dependent on reverse transcription and DNA sensor cGAS, suggesting activation of an IFN response by viral DNA. Further investigation of the Gag-fusion viral particles revealed maturation defects, as evidenced by incomplete Gag cleavage and a diminished capacity to saturate restriction factor TRIM5, likely due to aberrant particle formation. We propose that expression of the Gag fusion protein disturbs the correct cleavage and maturation of wild-type Gag, yielding viral particles that are unable to effectively shield viral DNA from detection by innate sensors including cGAS.\n\nConclusionsThese data highlight the crucial role of capsid in innate evasion and support growing literature that disruption of Gag cleavage and capsid formation induces a viral DNA- and cGAS-dependent innate immune response. Together these data demonstrate a protective role for capsid and suggest that antiviral activity of capsid-targeting antivirals may benefit from enhanced innate and adaptive immunity in vivo.",

Previous studies have used genome sequence data to suggest that transmission bottlenecks for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 involve few viral particles, but the general principles underlying these bottlenecks are not fully understood. Here we show that, across a broad range of circumstances, tight transmission bottlenecks arise as a consequence of the physical process underlying airborne viral transmission. We use a mathematical model to describe the process of infectious particles being emitted by an infected individual and inhaled by others nearby. The extent to which exposure to particles translates into infection is determined by an effective viral load, which is calculated as a function of the epidemiological parameter R0. Across multiple scenarios, including those present at a superspreading event, our model suggests that the great majority of transmission bottlenecks involve few viral particles, with a high proportion of infections being caused by a single viral particle. Our results provide a physical explanation for previous inferences of bottleneck size and predict that tight transmission bottlenecks prevail more generally in respiratory virus transmission.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between species have catalyzed the evolution of multiscale ecological networks-including both nested and modular elements that regulate the function of diverse communities. One common assumption is that such complex pattern formation requires long evolutionary timescales, spatial isolation, or other exogenous processes. Here we show that multiscale network structure can evolve rapidly under simple ecological conditions without spatial structure. In just 21 days of laboratory coevolution, Escherichia coli and bacteriophage {Phi}21 coevolve and diversify to form elaborate cross-infection networks. By measuring [~]10,000 phage-bacteria infections and testing the genetic basis of interactions, we identify the mechanisms that create each component of the multiscale pattern. Initially, nested patterns form through an arms race where hosts successively lose the original receptor (LamB) and phages evolve to use a second (OmpC) and then a third (OmpF) receptor. Next, modules form when the cost of losing the third receptor, OmpF, increases and bacteria evolve resistance mutations that modify the OmpF receptors extramembrane loops. In turn, phages evolve adaptations that facilitate specialized interactions with different OmpF variants. Nestedness reemerges within modules as bacteria evolve increased resistance and phages enhance infectivity against module-specific receptor variants. Our results demonstrate how multiscale networks evolve in parasite-host systems, illustrating Darwins idea that simple adaptive processes can generate entangled banks of ecological interactions.",

We generated iPSC-cardiomyocytes (CMs) from four children with HCM harboring variants in MYH7 (V606M; R453C) or MYBPC3 (G148R; P955fs and TNNI3_A157P), variant-corrected controls, and a healthy individual. All CMs showed hypertrophy and sarcomere disorganization. All 3 single variant CMs showed higher contractility, slower relaxation, higher calcium transients and higher ATPase activity. Only MYH7 variant CMs showed stronger myosin-actinin binding. Targeted myosin ATPase inhibitor showed complete rescue of the phenotype in affected CMs and in cardiac Biowires to mirror isogenic controls. The response was stronger compared to verapamil or metoprolol, highlighting the need for clinical trials of myosin targeted therapy in pediatric HCM patients. The phenotype and response to drug therapy are influenced by the underlying genotype.",

    "abstract": "Sorbitol is a critical photosynthate and storage substance in the Rosaceae family. Sorbitol transporters (SOTs) play a vital role in facilitating sorbitol allocation from source to sink organs and sugar accumulation in sink organs. Despite observing gene duplications in the SOT gene family, the origin and evolutionary process of these duplications are unclear, due to the complicated interplay of whole genome duplications and tandem duplications. Here, we investigated the synteny relationships of all detected Polyol/Monosaccharide Transporter (PLT) genes in 61 angiosperm genomes and SOT genes in major representative Rosaceae genomes. Combining phylogenetic analysis, we elucidated the lineage-specific expansion and syntenic conservation of PLTs and SOTs across different plant lineages. We found that Rosaceae SOTs, as PLT family members, originated from a pair of PLT tandem duplicating genes belonging to Class III-A. Additionally, lineage-specific and synergistic duplications in Amygdaloideae had contributed to the expansion of SOTs in Rosaceae plants. Overall, our findings provide insights into the genomic origins, duplication, and divergence of SOT gene family members, which are fundamental for further functional characterizations of each member.",

    "abstract": "Butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) are one of the most ecologically diverse and speciose insect orders, with more than 157,000 described species. However, the abundance and diversity of Lepidoptera are declining worldwide at an alarming rate. As few Lepidoptera are explicitly recognised as at risk globally, the need for conservation is neither mandated nor well-evidenced. Large-scale biodiversity genomics projects that take advantage of the latest developments in long-read sequencing technologies offer a valuable source of information. We here present a comprehensive, reference-free, whole-genome, multiple sequence alignment of 88 species of Lepidoptera. We show that the accuracy and quality of the alignment is influenced by the contiguity of the reference genomes analysed. We explored genomic signatures that might indicate conservation concern in these species. In our dataset, which is largely from Britain, many species, in particular moths, display low heterozygosity and a high level of inbreeding, reflected in medium (0.1 - 1 Mb) and long (> 1 Mb) runs of homozygosity. Many species with low inbreeding display a higher masked load, estimated from the sum of rejected substitution scores at heterozygous sites. Our study shows that the analysis of a single diploid genome in a comparative phylogenetic context can provide relevant genetic information to prioritise species for future conservation investigation, particularly for those with an unknown conservation status.",

    "abstract": "Boronic acid-containing fluorescent molecules have been widely used to sense hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite, which are important reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in biological systems. However, it has been challenging to gain specificity. Our previous studies developed genetically encoded, green fluorescent peroxynitrite biosensors by genetically incorporating a boronic acid-containing noncanonical amino acid (ncAA), p-boronophenylalanine (pBoF), into the chromophore of circularly permuted green fluorescent proteins (cpGFPs). In this work, we introduced pBoF to amino acid residues spatially close to the chromophore of an enhanced circularly permuted red fluorescent protein (ecpApple). Our effort has resulted in two responsive ecpApple mutants: one bestows reactivity toward both peroxynitrite and hydrogen peroxide, while the other, namely pnRFP, is a selective red fluorescent peroxynitrite biosensor. We characterized pnRFP in vitro and in live mammalian cells. We further studied the structure and sensing mechanism of pnRFP using X-ray crystallography, 11B-NMR, and computational methods. The boron atom in pnRFP adopts an sp2-hybridization geometry in a hydrophobic pocket, and the reaction of pnRFP with peroxynitrite generates a product with a twisted chromophore, corroborating the observed \"turn-off\" fluorescence response. Thus, this study extends the color palette of genetically encoded peroxynitrite biosensors, provides insight into the response mechanism of the new biosensor, and demonstrates the versatility of using protein scaffolds to modulate chemoreactivity.",

To date such studies have focused largely on bacteria and eukaryotes, with little attention given to the third domain of life, archaea. Furthermore, functional RNAs have not been extensively studied in archaea, leaving open questions about RNA structure and function within this domain of life. With archaeal species being diverse and having many similarities to both bacteria and eukaryotes, the archaea domain has the potential to be an evolutionary bridge. In this study, we introduce a method for probing RNA structure in vivo in the archaea domain of life. We investigated the structure of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) from Methanosarcina acetivorans, a well-studied anaerobic archaeal species, grown with either methanol or acetate. After probing the RNA in vivo with dimethyl sulfate (DMS), Structure-seq2 libraries were generated, sequenced, and analyzed. We mapped the reactivity of DMS onto the secondary structure of the ribosome, which we determined independently with comparative analysis, and confirmed the accuracy of DMS probing in M. acetivorans. Accessibility of the rRNA to DMS in the two carbon sources was found to be quite similar, although some differences were found. Overall, this study establishes the Structure-seq2 pipeline in the archaea domain of life and informs about ribosomal structure within M. acetivorans.",

Geobacillus thermoglucosidasius is a thermophilic bacterial chassis with industrial potential.

We obtained optically pure L-lactic acid- and D-lactic acid-producing strains, GTD17 and GTD7, respectively, via rational strategies: constructing a lactic acid synthesis module, deleting by-product synthesis, and enhancing lactic acid production. At an extremely high temperature (60{degrees}C), the engineered strain GTD17 produced 94.2 g L-1 of L-lactic acid with an overall yield and productivity of 91.5% and 2.0 g L-1 h-1, respectively, and the optical purity of L-lactic acid was 99.5%. We then performed semi-rational adaptive evolution on the engineered strain GTD7 to obtain an optically pure D-lactic acid-producing strain GTD7-144; at the extremely high temperature (60{degrees}C), it produced 153.1 g L-1 of D-lactic acid with an overall yield and productivity of 93.0% and 3.2 g L-1 h-1, respectively.

    "abstract": "Recent clinical observations highlight the importance of the spatial organization of immune cells into lymphoid structures for the success of cancer immunotherapy and patient survival. Sequential chromogenic immunohistochemistry (scIHC) supports the analysis of multiple biomarkers on a single tissue section thus providing unique information about relative location of cell types and assessment of disease states. Unfortunately, widespread implementation of scIHC is limited by lack of a standardized, rigorous guide to the development of customized biomarker panels and by the need for user-friendly analysis pipelines able to streamline the extraction of meaningful data. Here, we examine major steps from classical IHC protocols and highlight the impact they have on the scIHC procedure. We report practical examples and illustrations of the most common complications that can arise during the setup of a new biomarker panel and how to avoid them. We described in detail how to prevent and detect cross- reactivity between secondary reagents and carry over between detection antibodies. We developed a novel analysis pipeline based on non-rigid tissue deformation correction, Cellpose-inspired automated cell segmentation and computational network masking of low-quality data. The resulting biomarker panel and pipeline was used to study regional lymph nodes from head and neck cancer patients. We identified contact interactions between plasmablasts and plasmacytoid dendritic cells in vivo. Given that TLR receptors, which are highly expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic cells play a key role in vaccine efficacy, the significance of this cell-cell interaction decisively warrants further studies. In conclusion, this work streamlines the development of novel biomarker panels for scIHC, which will ultimately improve our understanding of immune responses in cancer.",

Here, we introduce paired yeast one-hybrid (pY1H) assays to detect cooperativity and antagonism across hundreds of TF-pairs at DNA regions of interest. We provide evidence that a wide variety of TFs are subject to modulation by other TFs in a DNA sequence-specific manner. We also demonstrate that TF-TF relationships are often affected by alternative isoform usage, and identify cooperativity and antagonism between human TFs and viral proteins. pY1H assays provide a broadly applicable framework to study how different functional relationships affect protein occupancy at regulatory DNA regions.",

A T cell-specific deletion of Hdac1 (HDAC1cKO) protects mice against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). However, it remains elusive whether inhibition of HDAC1 enzymatic activity, which could be achieved therapeutically by HDAC1 inhibitor treatment, is sufficient to block EAE induction. In order to address this question, we generated a novel mouse strain that expresses catalytically inactive HDAC1 (HDAC1Off) from the Rosa26 locus in HDAC1cKO CD4+ T cells to mimic selective inhibition of HDAC1 enzymatic activity in vivo. Mice expressing wildtype HDAC1 in HDAC1cKO CD4+ T cells (HDAC1On) were generated as corresponding controls. In contrast to HDAC1On mice, HDAC1Off mice did not develop EAE, and this correlated with diminished leukocyte CNS infiltration. HDAC1Off CD4+ T cells in the CNS displayed a severe reduction of IFN{gamma}, IL-17A and TNF proinflammatory cytokine expression, and in vivo activated HDAC1Off CD4+ T cells downregulated gene sets associated with T cell activation, cytokine expression and cell migration. This indicates impaired effector functions of HDAC1Off CD4+ T cells. Taken together, our study demonstrates that the inhibition of the catalytic activity of HDAC1 in T cells is sufficient to achieve a clinical benefit in EAE disease development.

    "abstract": "SummarySporulation in Bacillus subtilis has long been a model of cellular differentiation, many aspects of which are well understood. The early stage of this process is of particular interest, especially the interrelationship of regulatory processes with metabolism in response to environmental changes. We analyzed cellular fatty acids as their methyl esters using capillary gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry during the transition from vegetative growth to early sporulation phase. Measurement of changes in the content of heavy fatty acid analogs in cultures supplemented with deuterium-labeled valine or methionine, or 13C-labeld valine, showed that label was incorporated into the backbone of 12-methyltridecanoic and 14-methylpentadecanoic acid, in both sporulating and{Delta} spo0A cultures. These fatty acids were formed starting with isobutyryl-CoA apparently originating only from L-valine-d8 in cultures so supplemented. Our observations indicate that following vegetative growth a pathway exists from certain amino acids into fatty acid methylene groups, evidently passing through propionyl-CoA. This finding has the potential to deepen understanding of the metabolic basis of cellular differentiation and identify new targets for antibiotics. We also observed a significant, continuous increase in the proportion of 13-methyltetradecanoic acid in fatty acids during the same period in which the pre-spore membrane would be formed.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=142 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/536918v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (17K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bdebe0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c8de47org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17934daorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7d0b55_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Abbreviated SummaryEarly in at least some Bacillus subtilis differentiation scenarios, a straight-chain metabolite derived from propionyl-CoA is incorporated into fatty acids primed with isobutyryl-CoA possibly derived from cellular protein valine.

These domain-inlaid Nme2Cas9 variants exhibited shifted editing windows and increased activity in comparison to the N-terminally fused Nme2-ABE. We next expanded the editing scope by swapping the Nme2Cas9 PAM-interacting domain with that of SmuCas9, which we had previously defined as recognizing a single-cytidine PAM. We used these enhancements to correct two common MECP2 mutations associated with Rett syndrome with little or no bystander editing.

We designed and refined a bioinformatic pipeline to predict candidate microRNAs that potentially interfere with pre-mRNA stem-loop structures, and experimentally verified splicing predictions of three different long-range pre-mRNAs in the Drosophila model system. Specifically, we observed that microRNAs can either disrupt or stabilize stem-loop structures to influence splicing outcomes. Our study suggests that MicroRNA-Mediated Obstruction of Stem-loop Alternative Splicing (MIMOSAS) is a novel regulatory mechanism for the transcriptome-wide regulation of alternative splicing, increases the repertoire of microRNA function and further indicates cellular complexity of post-transcriptional regulation.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryMicroRNA-Mediated Obstruction of Stem-loop Alternative Splicing (MIMOSAS) is a novel regulatory mechanism for the transcriptome-wide regulation of alternative splicing.",

    "abstract": "Worsening marine hypoxia has had severe negative consequences for fish communities across the globe. While individual{-} and population{-}level impacts of deoxygenation have been identified, it is unknown how they interact to drive changes in food webs. To address this, we incorporated several major impacts of hypoxia, including declines in benthic re{-} sources, habitat shifts, increasing mortality, and changes to rates of feeding, assimilation, and reproductive efficiency, into an existing size spectrum food web modeling framework. We used this structure to ask the following questions: which of these direct effects are most critical to capturing population and community dynamics in a representative hypoxic system, how do they interact to result in community responses to deoxygenation, and what are the potential consequences of these effects in the context of accelerating deoxygenation? We tested the effect of different combinations of oxygen{-}dependent processes, driven by observed oxygen levels, on the food web models ability to explain time series of observed somatic growth, diets, biomass, and fishery yields of commercially relevant species in the Baltic Sea. Model results suggest that food availability is most critical to capturing observed dynamics. There is also some evidence for oxygen{-}dependent habitat use and physological rates as drivers of observed dynamics. Deoxygenation results in declining growth both of benthic and benthopelagic fish species, as the latter are unable to compensate for the loss of benthic resources by consuming more pelagic fish and resources. Analysis of scenarios of ideal, declining, and degraded oxygen conditions show that deoxygenation results in a decline in somatic growth of predators, an altered habitat occupancy resulting in changing species interactions, and a shift in energy flow to benthopelagic predators from benthic to pelagic resources. This may have important implications for management as oxygen declines or improves.",

    "abstract": "Organisms have evolved a range of constitutive (always active) and inducible (elicited by parasites) defence mechanisms, but we have limited understanding of what drives the evolution of these orthogonal defence strategies. Bacteria and their phages offer a tractable system to study this: bacteria can acquire constitutive resistance by mutation of the phage receptor (surface mutation, sm) or induced resistance through their CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune system. Using a combination of theory and experiments we demonstrate that the mechanism that establishes first has a strong advantage because it weakens selection for the alternative resistance mechanism. As a consequence, ecological factors that alter the relative frequencies at which the different resistances are acquired have a strong and lasting impact: high growth conditions promote the evolution of sm resistance by increasing the influx of receptor mutation events during the early stages of the epidemic, whereas a high infection risk during this stage of the epidemic promotes the evolution of CRISPR immunity, since it fuels the (infection-dependent) acquisition of CRISPR immunity. This work highlights the strong and lasting impact of the transient evolutionary dynamics during the early stages of an epidemic on the long-term evolution of constitutive and induced defences, which may be leveraged to manipulate phage resistance evolution in clinical and applied settings.",

    "abstract": "Plants can not move automatically, thus they have to perceive the changing environment (light, temperate and so on) by developing the adapted phenotypes. Light-induced hypocotyl length is an ideal phenotype for studying how plants response to light. So far, many signaling components in light-induced hypocotyl growth have been reported. Here, we focused on identifying transcription factors (TFs) involved in blue light-induced hypocotyl growth by constructing Arabidopsis TFs overexpressing lines and screening blue light-induced hypocotyl length. Finally, we found that three NF-YC proteins, NF-YC7, NF-YC5 and NF-YC8 (NF-YCs as short name), develop longer hypocotyls than the wild type under blue light. While deficient mutants, nf-yc5nf-yc7 and nf-yc7nf-yc8, fail to promote the hypocotyl elongation under blue light.\n\nNF-YCs physically interacted with CRY2 and PIF4/5, while the NF-YCs-PIF4/5 interactions were repressed by CRY2. Moreover, overexpression of CRY2 or deficiency of PIF4/5 repressed the hypocotyl elongation induced by NF-YC7 under blue light. Further investigation revealed that NF-YC7 increased the blue light-induced CRY2 degradation and regulated the activities of PIF4/5.\n\nTaking together, this study provided a new insight into that NF-YCs function as CRY2-and PIF4/5-interacting proteins and modulate their stabilization to repress the blue light-mediated hypocotyl growth.\n\nAuthor SummaryLight is an essential environmental factor for plants growth and development. Plants response to light signaling by displaying short hypocotyls, green leaves, and so on. The mechanisms of light responding to light have aroused extensive attention. In this study, we clarified that NF-YC family members NF-YC5/7/8 interact with CRY2, PIF4/5 and modulate their stabilization to repress the blue light-mediated hypocotyl growth. It was the first time for reporting NF-Y family members function as CRY2-and PIF4/5-interacting proteins. Therefore, this study provides a novel understanding how plants adapt to light.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative analysis depends on pure-substance primary calibrators with known mass fractions of impurity. Here, label-free quantification (LFQ) is being evaluated as a readily available, reliable method for determining the mass fraction of host-cell proteins (HCPs) in bioengineered proteins. For example, hemoglobin-A2 (HbA2) is being used as obtained through overexpression in E.coli. Two different materials had been produced: natural, and U-15N-labeled HbA2. For quantification of impurity, precursorion (MSl-) intensities were integrated over all E.coli -proteins identified, and divided by the intensities obtained for HbA2. This ratio was calibrated against the corresponding results for E.coli-cell lysate, which had been spiked at known mass-ratios to pure HbA2. To demonstrate the universal applicability of LFQ, further proteomes (yeast and human K562) were then alternatively used for calibration and found to produce comparable results. Valid results could also be obtained when the complexity of the calibrator is reduced to a mix of nine proteins, and a minimum of five proteins is estimated to be sufficient to keep the sampling error below l5%. For the studied materials, HbA2-mass fractions of 916{+/-}15 mg/g and 922{+/-}11 mg/g were found. Value assignment by LFQ thus contributes 1-2% to the overall uncertainty of HbA2-quantification when these materials are used as calibrators. Further purification of the natural HbA2 yielded 999.1{+/-} 0.15 mg/g, corresponding to {approx} 0.2% of uncertainty contribution, though at a significant loss of material. If an overall-uncertainty of 5% is acceptable for protein-quantification, working with the original materials would definitely be viable, therefore.",

Currently, structural and functional studies of TREM2 mainly rely on recombinant TREM2 proteins expressed from mammalian cells. However, using this method, it is difficult to achieve site-specific labeling. Here we present the total chemical synthesis of the 116 amino-acid TREM2 ectodomain. Rigorous structural analysis ensured correct structural fold after refolding. Treating microglial cells with refolded synthetic TREM2 enhanced microglial phagocytosis, proliferation, and survival. We also prepared TREM2 constructs with defined glycosylation patterns and found that glycosylation at N79 is critical to the thermal stability of TREM2. This method will provide access to TREM2 constructs with site-specific labeling, such as fluorescent labeling, reactive chemical handles, and enrichment handles, to further advance our understanding of TREM2 in Alzheimers disease.",

Comparisons on simulated data show that mvSuSiE is competitive in speed, power and precision with existing multi-trait methods, and uniformly improves on single-trait fine-mapping (SuSiE) in each trait separately. We applied mvSuSiE to jointly fine-map 16 blood cell traits using data from the UK Biobank. By jointly analyzing the traits and modeling heterogeneous effect sharing patterns, we discovered a much larger number of causal SNPs (>3,000) compared with single-trait fine-mapping, and with narrower credible sets. mvSuSiE also more comprehensively characterized the ways in which the genetic variants affect one or more blood cell traits; 68% of causal SNPs showed significant effects in more than one blood cell type.",
