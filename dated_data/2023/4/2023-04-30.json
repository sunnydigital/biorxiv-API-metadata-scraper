    "abstract": "Multivariate statistics and machine learning methods have become a common tool to extract information represented in the brain. What is less recognized is that, in the process, it has become more difficult to perform data-driven discovery and functional localization. This is because multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) studies tend to restrict themselves to a subset of the available data, or because sound inference to map model parameters back to brain anatomy is lacking. Here, we present a high-dimensional (including brain-wide) multivariate classification pipeline for the detection and localization of brain functions during tasks. In particular, we probe it at visual and socio-affective states in a task-oriented functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment. Classification models for a group of human participants and existing rigorous cluster inference methods are used to construct group anatomical-statistical parametric maps, which correspond to the most likely neural correlates of each psychological state. This led to the discovery of a multidimensional pattern of macroscale brain activity which reliably encodes for the perception of happiness in the visual cortex, lingual gyri and the posterior perivermian cerebellum. We failed to find similar evidence for sadness and anger. Anatomical consistency of discriminating features across subjects and contrasts despite the high number of dimensions suggests MVPA is a viable tool for a complete functional mapping pipeline, and not just the prediction of psychological states.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=134 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/438425v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (34K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1961forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@26d25aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bc4b35org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1eda0a6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "AbstractDuring apoptosis, caspases degrade 8 out of [~]30 nucleoporins to irreversibly demolish the nuclear pore complex. However, for poorly understood reasons, caspases are also activated during cell differentiation. Here, we show that sublethal activation of caspases during myogenesis results in the transient proteolysis of four peripheral Nups and one transmembrane Nup. \"Trimmed\" NPCs become nuclear export-defective, and we identified in an unbiased manner several classes of cytoplasmic, plasma-membrane, and mitochondrial proteins that rapidly accumulate in the nucleus. NPC trimming by non-apoptotic caspases was also observed in neurogenesis and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Our results suggest that caspases can reversibly modulate nuclear transport activity, which allows them to function as agents of cell differentiation and adaptation at sublethal levels.",

    "abstract": "The linear mixed-effects model (LME) is a versatile modeling approach to deal with correlations among observations. Many large-scale neuroimaging datasets with complex designs have increased the need for LME, however LME has seldom been used in whole-brain imaging analyses due to its heavy computational requirements. In this paper, we introduce a fast and efficient mixed-effects algorithm (FEMA) that makes whole-brain vertex-wise, voxel-wise, and connectome-wide LME analyses in large samples possible. We validate FEMA with extensive simulations, showing that the estimates of the fixed effects are equivalent to standard maximum likelihood estimates but obtained with orders of magnitude improvement in computational speed. We demonstrate the applicability of FEMA by studying the cross-sectional and longitudinal effects of age on region-of-interest level and vertex-wise cortical thickness, as well as connectome-wide functional connectivity values derived from resting state functional MRI, using longitudinal imaging data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM Study release 4.0. Our analyses reveal distinct spatial patterns for the annualized changes in vertex-wise cortical thickness and connectome-wide connectivity values in early adolescence, highlighting a critical time of brain maturation. The simulations and application to real data show that FEMA enables advanced investigation of the relationships between large numbers of neuroimaging metrics and variables of interest while considering complex study designs, including repeated measures and family structures, in a fast and efficient manner.

However, the role of VEGF-C in regulating tumor cell dissemination to distant organs is currently unclear. Perivascular tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are key regulators of hematogenous cancer cell spreading, forming tumor microenvironment of metastasis (TMEM) doorways for breast cancer cells to intravasate tumor blood vessels and fuel distant metastases. Using an experimental breast cancer (BC) model, we show here that TAMs expressing VEGF-C decrease cancer cell dissemination to the lung while enhancing lymph node metastasis. These TAMs express podoplanin and LYVE-1 and associate with normalized tumor blood vessels expressing VEGFR3. Further clinical data reveal that VEGF-C+ TAMs correlate inversely with malignant grade and with the occurrence of TMEM complexes in a cohort of BC patients. Thus, our study displays an apparently paradoxical role of TAM-derived VEGF-C in redirecting cancer cells to preferentially disseminate to the lymph nodes, at least in part, by normalizing tumor blood vessels.",

    "abstract": "AimThe coexistence and turnover of species along elevation gradients makes tropical mountains hotspots of biodiversity. However, understanding the historical processes through which species arising in geographic isolation (i.e. allopatry) assemble along the same mountain slope (i.e. sympatry) remains a major challenge. Multiple models have been proposed including, (1) the sorting of already elevationally divergent species, (2) the displacement of elevation upon secondary contact, potentially followed by convergence, or (3) elevational conservatism, in which ancestral elevational ranges are retained. However, the relative contribution of these processes to generating patterns of elevational overlap and turnover is unknown.\n\nLocationTropical mountains of Central- and South-America.\n\nTime periodThe last 12 myr.\n\nMajor taxa studiedBirds.\n\nMethodsWe collate a dataset of 165 avian sister pairs containing estimates of phylogenetic age, geographical and regional elevational range overlap. We develop a framework based on continuous-time Markov models to infer the relative frequency of different historical pathways in explaining present day overlap and turnover of sympatric species along elevational gradients.\n\nResultsWe show that the turnover of closely related bird species across elevation can predominantly be explained by displacement of elevation ranges upon contact (81%) rather than elevational divergence in allopatry (19%). In contrast, overlap along elevation gradients is primarily (88%) explained by conservatism of elevational ranges rather than displacement followed by elevational expansion (12%).\n\nMain conclusionsBird communities across tropical elevation gradients are assembled through a mix of processes, including the sorting, displacement and conservatism of species elevation ranges. The dominant role of conservatism in explaining co-occurrence of species on mountain slopes rejects more complex scenarios requiring displacement followed by subsequent expansion. The ability of closely related species to coexist without elevational divergence provides a direct and thus faster pathway to sympatry and may help explain the exceptional species richness of tropical mountains.",

Here, we explore the characteristics of events while subjects watch movies. Using two independently-acquired imaging datasets in which participants passively watched movies, we find that events synchronize across individuals and based on the level of synchronization, can be categorized into three distinct classes: those that synchronize at the boundaries between movies, those that synchronize during movies, and those that do not synchronize at all. We find that boundary events, compared to the other categories, exhibit greater amplitude, distinct co-fluctuation patterns, and temporal propagation. We show that underlying boundary events is a specific mode of co-fluctuation involving the activation of control and salience systems alongside the deactivation of visual systems. Events that synchronize during the movie, on the other hand, display a pattern of co-fluctuation that is time-locked to the movie stimulus. Finally, we found that subjects time-varying brain networks are most similar to one another during these synchronous events.",

    "abstract": "Previous literature suggests that a balance between Pavlovian and instrumental decision-making systems is critical for optimal decision-making. Pavlovian bias (i.e., approach toward reward-predictive stimuli and avoid punishment-predictive stimuli) often contrasts with the instrumental response. Although recent neuroimaging studies have identified brain regions that may be related to Pavlovian bias, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), it is unclear whether a causal relationship exists. Therefore, we investigated whether upregulation of the dlPFC using transcranial current direct stimulation (tDCS) would reduce Pavlovian bias. In this double-blind study, participants were assigned to the anodal or the sham group; they received stimulation over the right dlPFC for 3 successive days. On the last day, participants performed a reinforcement learning task known as the orthogonalized go/no-go task; this was used to assess each participants degree of Pavlovian bias in reward and punishment domains. We used computational modeling and hierarchical Bayesian analysis to estimate model parameters reflecting latent cognitive processes, including Pavlovian bias, go bias, and choice randomness. Several computational models were compared; the model with separate Pavlovian bias parameters for reward and punishment domains demonstrated the best model fit. When using a behavioral index of Pavlovian bias, the anodal group showed significantly lower Pavlovian bias in the punishment domain, but not in the reward domain, compared with the sham group. In addition, computational modeling showed that Pavlovian bias parameter in the punishment domain was lower in the anodal group than in the sham group, which is consistent with the behavioral findings. The anodal group also showed a lower go bias and choice randomness, compared with the sham group. These findings suggest that anodal tDCS may lead to behavioral suppression or change in Pavlovian bias in the punishment domain, which will help to improve comprehension of the causal neural mechanism.\n\nAuthor summaryA decision-making bias guided by the Pavlovian system (i.e., approach reward and avoid punishment) is often useful and predominant across species but it is also related to several psychiatric conditions. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is known to be related to such \"Pavlovian bias\" but it is unclear whether a causal relationship exists between them. Here, we evaluated whether decision-making biases including Pavlovian bias could be modulated by exogenous brain stimulation, transcranial current direct stimulation, over the right dlPFC for 3 successive days. A combination of behavioral analysis and computational modeling revealed that the anodal group had lower Pavlovian bias in the punishment domain compared with the sham group. In addition, the anodal group showed lower go bias and choice randomness than the sham group, which can also hamper instrumental learning. These findings suggest a causal role for the dlPFC in modulating the balance between the Pavlovian and instrumental decision-making systems.",

    "abstract": "Vibrio cholerae is a facultative pathogen that primarily occupies marine environments. In this niche, V. cholerae commonly interacts with the chitinous shells of crustacean zooplankton. As a chitinolytic microbe, V. cholerae degrades insoluble chitin into soluble oligosaccharides. Chitin oligosaccharides serve as both a nutrient source and an environmental cue that induces a strong transcriptional response in V. cholerae. Namely, these oligosaccharides induce the chitin sensor, ChiS, to activate the genes required for chitin utilization and horizontal gene transfer by natural transformation. Thus, interactions with chitin impact the survival of V. cholerae in marine environments. Chitin is a complex carbon source for V. cholerae to degrade and consume, and the presence of more energetically favorable carbon sources can inhibit chitin utilization. This phenomenon, known as carbon catabolite repression (CCR), is mediated by the glucose-specific Enzyme IIA (EIIAGlc) of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS). In the presence of glucose, EIIAGlc becomes dephosphorylated, which inhibits ChiS transcriptional activity by an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that dephosphorylated EIIAGlc interacts with ChiS. We also isolate ChiS suppressor mutants that evade EIIAGlc-dependent repression and demonstrate that these alleles no longer interact with EIIAGlc. These findings suggest that EIIAGlc must interact with ChiS to exert its repressive effect. Importantly, the ChiS suppressor mutations we isolated also relieve repression of chitin utilization and natural transformation by EIIAGlc, suggesting that CCR of these behaviors is primarily regulated through ChiS. Together, our results reveal how nutrient conditions impact the fitness of an important human pathogen in its environmental reservoir.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYVibrio cholerae is a facultative human pathogen that most commonly inhabits aquatic environments and can cause the disease cholera when ingested in the form of contaminated food or drinking water. The survival of this pathogen in the marine environment is dependent upon its ability to colonize chitin, an insoluble polysaccharide that is the main constituent of the shells of crustacean zooplankton. V. cholerae degrades chitin into soluble oligomers, which can be taken up by this microbe and used as a nutrient. Importantly, chitin oligomers also induce the activity of a chitin-sensing protein, ChiS, to activate the expression of genes required for both (1) eating chitin and (2) undergoing horizontal gene transfer by natural transformation. Previous work demonstrated that more energetically favorable carbon sources, like glucose, can inhibit chitin-induced behaviors. However, the mechanism underlying this response remained unclear. Here, we show how a dephosphorylated intermediate in the glucose uptake pathway - EIIAGlc - interacts with ChiS to repress its activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this repression of ChiS by EIIAGlc is responsible for inhibiting both growth on chitin and natural transformation. Together, our results reveal how nutrient conditions impact the fitness of a major human pathogen in its environmental reservoir.",

    "abstract": "Perception and adaptive decision making rely on the integration of incoming sensory input with prior knowledge or expectations. While tactile stimuli play a significant role in shaping our perception and decision making, if and how prior information modulates the representation of tactile stimuli in early somatosensory cortices is largely unknown. Here, we employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a vibrotactile detection paradigm to study the effect of prior information on tactile perception and tactile stimulus representation in early somatosensory areas. The supra-voxel somatotopic organization of early somatosensory areas allowed us to assess the effect of prior information on finger-specific representations. We found that vibrotactile stimuli congruent with expectations are associated with improved vibrotactile detection performance and a decrease of the mean blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal in the contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Concurrently, finger-specific activity associated with anticipated vibrotactile stimulation revealed higher multivariate decoding accuracies and better alignment with S1s somatotopic organization. In addition, we observed that prior information induced somatotopically organized activity in contralateral S1 even before tactile stimulation onset. The accuracy of the multivariate decoding of stimulus-specific expectations was therefore strongly associated with upcoming behavioral detection performance. Thus, our results reveal a role for S1 in the integration of upcoming tactile stimuli with prior information based on its somatotopic organization as well as the presence of behaviorally relevant activity in S1 before stimulation onset.",

Oligomeric amyloid beta (oA{beta}) is considered a major synaptotoxic trigger for AD. Recent studies have implicated hyperactivation of the complement cascade as the driving force for loss of synapses caused by oA{beta}. However, the initial synaptic cues that trigger pathological complement activity remain elusive. Here, we examined a form of synaptic long-term depression (LTD) mediated by metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) which is disrupted in rodent models of AD. Exogenous application of oA{beta} (1-42) to mouse hippocampal slices enhanced the magnitude of mGlu subtype 5 receptor (mGlu5R)-dependent LTD. We found that the enhanced synaptic weakening occurred via both NMDARs and complement C3aR/C5aR signaling.

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that posttranscriptional control of gene expression, including RNA splicing, transport, modification, translation, and degradation, primarily relies on RNA binding proteins (RBPs). However, the functions of many RBPs remain understudied. Here, we characterized the function of a novel RBP, Proline-Rich Coiled-coil 2B (PRRC2B). Through photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation and sequencing (PAR-CLIP-seq), we identified transcriptome-wide CU- or GA-rich PRRC2B binding sites near the translation initiation codon on a specific cohort of mRNAs in HEK293T cells. These mRNAs, including oncogenes and cell cycle regulators such as CCND2 (cyclin D2), exhibited decreased translation upon PRRC2B knockdown as revealed by polysome-associated RNA-seq, resulting in reduced G1/S phase transition and cell proliferation. Antisense oligonucleotides blocking PRRC2B interactions with CCND2 mRNA decreased its translation, thus inhibiting G1/S transition and cell proliferation. Mechanistically, PRRC2B interactome analysis revealed RNA-independent interactions with eukaryotic translation initiation factors 3 (eIF3) and 4G2 (eIF4G2). The interaction with translation initiation factors is essential for PRRC2B function since the eIF3/eIF4G2-interacting defective mutant, unlike wild-type PRRC2B, failed to rescue the translation deficiency or cell proliferation inhibition caused by PRRC2B knockdown. Altogether, our findings reveal that PRRC2B is essential for efficiently translating specific proteins required for cell cycle progression and cell proliferation.\n\nGraphic Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=190 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/520836v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cc9385org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e92f55org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1228c7corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1352179_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Unlike protein-coding regions, enhancers generally evolve rapidly. By examining enhancer turnover across mammalian species and in multiple tissue-types, we uncovered a relationship between the emergence of novel enhancers and genome organization, reflected by DNA replication time. While enhancers are most abundant in euchromatic regions, new enhancers emerged almost twice as often in late compared to early replicating regions, independent of transposable elements. Using a deep learning model, we demonstrate that new enhancers are enriched for mutations that alter transcription factor (TF) binding. Overall recent enhancers often exhibit neutral evolution, eQTL enrichment, and greater tissue specificity than their evolutionarily conserved counterparts. Accordingly, transcription factors that bind to these enhancers, inferred by their binding sequences, are also more recently evolved and more tissue-specific in gene expression. A similar relationship with DNA replication time is observed in multiple cancer types. Somatic mutations in cancer are consistently elevated in enhancers that have undergone turnover compared to those that remain unchanged. These results demonstrate a relationship between DNA replication time and enhancer evolution across diverse time scales, suggesting that these observations may be time-invariant principles of genome evolution.",

    "abstract": "How cells coordinate their metabolism with division determines the rate of cell proliferation. Dynamic patterns of metabolite synthesis during the cell cycle are unexplored. We report the first isotope tracing analysis in synchronous, growing budding yeast cells. Synthesis of leucine, a branched-chain amino acid (BCAA), increased through the G1 phase of the cell cycle, peaking later during DNA replication. Cells lacking Bat1, a mitochondrial aminotransferase that synthesizes BCAAs, grew slower, were smaller, and were delayed in the G1 phase, phenocopying cells in which the growth-promoting kinase complex TORC1 was moderately inhibited. Loss of Bat1 lowered the levels of BCAAs and reduced TORC1 activity. Exogenous provision of BCAAs to cells lacking Bat1 promoted cell division and increased TORC1 activity. In wild-type cells, TORC1 activity was dynamic in the cell cycle, starting low in early G1 but increasing later in the cell cycle. These results suggest a link between BCAA synthesis from glucose to TORC1 activation in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.",

Such competitive exclusion mechanisms potentially underly microbiome dynamics, causing breakdowns of communities composed of species with similar genetic backgrounds of resource utilization. Although genes responsible for competitive exclusion among a small number of species have been investigated in pioneering studies, it remains a major challenge to integrate genomics and ecology for understanding stable coexistence in species-rich communities. Here, we show that community-scale analyses of functional gene redundancy can provide a useful platform for interpreting and predicting collapse of bacterial communities. Through 110-day time-series of experimental microbiome dynamics, we analyzed the metagenome-assembled genomes of co-occurring bacterial species. We then inferred ecological niche space based on the multivariate analysis of the genome compositions. The analysis allowed us to evaluate potential shifts in the level of niche overlap between species through time. We hypothesized that community-scale pressure of competitive exclusion could be evaluated by quantifying overlap of genetically determined resource-use profiles (metabolic pathway profiles) among coexisting species. We found that the degree of community compositional changes observed in the experimental microbiome was explained by the magnitude of gene-repertoire overlaps among bacterial species. The metagenome-based analysis of genetic potential for competitive exclusion will help us forecast major events in microbiome dynamics such as sudden community collapse (i.e., dysbiosis).",

    "abstract": "Intracellular plant immune receptors, termed NLRs, respond to pathogen effectors delivered into plant cells. Activation of NLRs typically confers immunity. Sensor NLRs, involved in effector recognition, are either TIR-NLRs (TNLs) or CC-NLRs (CNLs). Helper NLRs, required for sensor NLR signaling, include CCR-NLRs (RNLs) and a special class of CNLs known as NRCs. Activated TNLs produce small molecules that induce an association between the EDS1/SAG101 heterodimer and the NRG1s helper RNLs. Auto active NRG1s oligomerize and form calcium signaling channels largely localized at the plasma membrane (PM). The molecular mechanisms of helper NLR PM association and effector induced NRG1 oligomerization are not well characterized. We find that both RNLs and NRCs require positively charged residues in the second and fourth helices of their CCR or CC domain for phospholipid binding and PM association before and after activation, despite conformational changes that accompany activation. We demonstrate that effector activation of TNLs induces NRG1 oligomerization at the PM and that the cytoplasmic pool of EDS1/SAG101 is critical for cell death function. EDS1/SAG101 cannot be detected in the oligomerized NRG1 resistosome, suggesting that additional unknown triggers might be required to induce the dissociation of EDS1/SAG101 from the previously described NRG1/EDS1/SAG101 heterotrimer before subsequent NRG1 oligomerization, or that the conformational changes resulting from NRG1 oligomerization abrogate the interface for EDS1/SAG101 association. Our data provide new observations regarding dynamic PM association during helper NLR activation and underpin an updated model for effector induced NRG1 resistosome formation.",

    "abstract": "Insulin-mTOR signaling drives anabolic growth during organismal development, while its late-life dysregulation may detrimentally contribute to aging and limit lifespans. Age-related regulatory mechanisms and functional consequences of insulin-mTOR remain incompletely understood. Here we identify LPD-3 as a megaprotein that orchestrates the tempo of insulin-mTOR signaling during C. elegans aging. We find that an agonist insulin INS-7 is drastically over-produced in early life and shortens lifespan in lpd-3 mutants, a C. elegans model of human Alkuraya-Ku[c]inskas syndrome. LPD-3 forms a bridge-like tunnel megaprotein to facilitate phospholipid trafficking to plasma membranes. Lipidomic profiling reveals increased abundance of hexaceramide species in lpd-3 mutants, accompanied by up-regulation of hexaceramide biosynthetic enzymes, including HYL-1 (Homolog of Yeast Longevity). Reducing HYL-1 activity decreases INS-7 levels and rescues the lifespan of lpd-3 mutants through insulin receptor/DAF-2 and mTOR/LET-363. LPD-3 antagonizes SINH-1, a key mTORC2 component, and decreases expression with age in wild type animals. We propose that LPD-3 acts as a megaprotein brake for aging and its age-dependent decline restricts lifespan through the sphingolipid-hexaceramide and insulin-mTOR pathways.",

    "abstract": "Genomics has strongly increased the available experimental strategies to identify the elements involved in regulatory networks, particularly those of the regulation of transcription initiation. As new methodologies emerge, a natural step is to compare their results with available knowledge obtained by previously established methodologies, such as the classic methods of molecular biology used to characterize transcription factor binding and regulatory sites, promoters, and transcription units.\n\nSuch previous knowledge is dispersed in the scientific literature, limiting their accessibility. Fortunately, in the case of Escherichia coli K-12, the best studied microorganism, we have been continuously gathering this knowledge from original scientific publications for the last 30 years, and have made it available to the public in two databases, RegulonDB and EcoCyc. More recently, we have also gathered knowledge generated by genomic high throughput (HT) methodologies as can be appreciated in the latest RegulonDB version 11.0, where, in addition to the objects and interactions identified by methods of molecular biology, users can find datasets of binding sites from ChIP-seq, ChIP-exo, gSELEX and DAP-seq HT technologies. This has motivated us to work on improving our evidence codes to facilitate their use as gold standards. In order to enhance the precision of knowledge representation, we implemented three alternatives to curate regulatory interactions, based on the level of detail provided by the experiments. We present them in a way that users can select different versions of objects based on properties such as the methods used to identify them (classic, computational predictions, HT methods); in vivo vs in vitro approaches; and degree of confidence (weak, strong, confirmed) of the evidence supporting them. The collection of regulatory interactions is analyzed based on their supporting evidence, showing how classic methods still provide for the largest fraction of strong and confirmed sites, a distribution likely to change in the years to come as HT methods may become the dominant strategies to identify regulatory genomic components. We plan to keep updating and expanding these gold standard datasets as part of future RegulonDB releases.",

    "abstract": "Acquired ribosomal RNA (rRNA) methylation has emerged as a significant mechanism of aminoglycoside resistance in pathogenic bacterial infections. Modification of a single nucleotide in the ribosome decoding center by the aminoglycoside-resistance 16S rRNA (m7G1405) methyltransferases effectively blocks the action of all 4,6-deoxystreptamine ring-containing aminoglycosides, including the latest generation of drugs. To define the molecular basis of 30S subunit recognition and G1405 modification by these enzymes, we used a S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) analog to trap the complex in a post-catalytic state to enable determination of an overall 3.0 [A] cryo-electron microscopy structure of the m7G1405 methyltransferase RmtC bound to the mature Escherichia coli 30S ribosomal subunit. This structure, together with functional analyses of RmtC variants, identifies the RmtC N-terminal domain as critical for recognition and docking of the enzyme on a conserved 16S rRNA tertiary surface adjacent to G1405 in 16S rRNA helix 44 (h44). To access the G1405 N7 position for modification, a collection of residues across one surface of RmtC, including a loop that undergoes a disorder to order transition upon 30S subunit binding, induces significant distortion of h44. This distortion flips G1405 into the enzyme active site where it is positioned for modification by two almost universally conserved RmtC residues. These studies expand our understanding of ribosome recognition by rRNA modification enzymes and present a more complete structural basis for future development of strategies to inhibit m7G1405 modification to re-sensitize bacterial pathogens to aminoglycosides.\n\nSignificanceIncreasing prevalence of bacterial antibiotic resistance threatens our ability to treat bacterial infections and with it, many other facets of modern healthcare. For the ribosome-targeting aminoglycoside antibiotics, diverse pathogenic bacteria have acquired ribosomal RNA (rRNA) methyltransferase enzymes that confer exceptionally high-level resistance through site-specific modification of the drug binding site. Here, we define the molecular basis for ribosomal substrate recognition and modification by an enzyme (RmtC) representing the most clinically prevalent methyltransferase family. Specifically, RmtC exploits a conserved rRNA surface for binding and induces significant disruption of the rRNA structure to capture the target nucleotide for modification via a \"base flipping\" mechanism. These insights also present a platform for methyltransferase inhibitor development to extend usefulness of aminoglycoside antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "Cell division is fundamental to all healthy tissue growth, as well as being rate-limiting in the tissue repair response to wounding and during cancer progression. However, the role that cell divisions play in tissue growth is a collective one, requiring the integration of many individual cell division events. It is particularly difficult to accurately detect and quantify multiple features of large numbers of cell divisions (including their spatio-temporal synchronicity and orientation), over extended periods of time. It would thus be advantageous to perform such analyses in an automated fashion, which can naturally be much enabled using Deep Learning. Hence, here we have developed a pipeline of Deep Learning Models that accurately identify dividing cells in timelapse movies of epithelial tissues in vivo. Our pipeline also determines their axis of division orientation, as well as their shape changes before and after division. This strategy has enabled us to analyse the dynamic profile of cell divisions within the Drosophila pupal wing epithelium, both as it undergoes developmental morphogenesis, and as it repairs following laser wounding. We show that the axis of division is biased according to lines of tissue tension and that wounding triggers a synchronised (but not oriented) wave of cell divisions back from the leading edge.\n\nHighlightsO_LIAccurate and efficient detection of epithelial cell divisions can be automated by deep learning of dynamic time-lapse imaging data\nC_LIO_LIOptimal division detection is achieved using multiple timepoints and dual channels for visualisation of nuclei and cell boundaries\nC_LIO_LIEpithelial cell divisions are orientated according to lines of tissue tension\nC_LIO_LISpatio-temporal cell division analyses following wounding reveal spatial synchronicity that scales with wound size\nC_LIO_LIAdditional deep learning tools enable rapid analysis of cell division orientation\nC_LI",

Using an original consumption test device that takes into account the variability of larvae behaviour, we were able to phenotype the resistance of the 18 maize lines. We matched consumption data to existing enzymatic and metabolomic data that characterized the maize core-collection and identified some metabolites such as caffeoyl-lquinate, trocopherol, digalactosylglycerol and tyrosine that are positively or negatively correlated with the palatability to ECB larvae. Altogether, our results confirm the metabolic complexity involved in the establishment of plant defenses.

We firstly conducted contrastive learning-based pre-training on tessellated tiles to extract histopathological features, which are then aggregated by attention pooling and adapted to downstream tasks. Our extensive experiments showed that our method achieved state-of-the-art performance in tumor diagnostic task, and also performed well in predicting clinically relevant protein levels and drug response. To show the model interpretability, we spatially visualized the WSIs colored the tiles by their attention scores, and found that the regions with high scores were highly consistent with the tumor and necrotic regions annotated by a 10-year experienced pathologist. Moreover, spatial transcriptomic data further verified that the heatmap generated by attention scores agree greatly with the spatial expression landscape of two typical tumor biomarker genes. In particular, our method achieved 0.79 AUC value in predicting the response of breast cancer patients to the drug trastuzumab treatment.

Here we use extensive transcriptome datasets from 20 krill species collected across the Atlantic, Indian, Pacific and Southern Oceans and compare genetic variation both within and between species across thousands of genes. We resolve phylogenetic interrelationships and uncover genomic evidence in support of elevating the cryptic Euphausia similis var. armata into species. We estimate levels of genetic variation and rates of adaptive protein evolution among species and find that these are comparably low in large Southern Ocean species endemic to cold environments, including the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, suggesting their adaptive potential to rapid climate change may also be low. We uncover hundreds of candidate loci with signatures of adaptive divergence between krill native to cold and warm waters and identify candidates for cold-adaptation that have also been detected in Antarctic fish, including genes that govern thermal reception such as TrpA1. Our results suggest parallel genetic responses to similar selection pressures across Antarctic taxa and provide new insights into the adaptive potential of important zooplankton that are already strongly affected by climate change.",

    "abstract": "Selective macroautophagy of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the nucleus, known as ER-phagy and nucleophagy respectively, are processes whose mechanisms remain inadequately understood. Through an imaging-based screen, we find that fission yeast Yep1, the ortholog of human REEP1-4, is essential for ER-phagy and nucleophagy, but not for bulk autophagy. In the absence of Yep1, the initial phase of ER-phagy and nucleophagy proceeds normally, with the ER-phagy/nucleophagy receptor Epr1 co-assembling with Atg8. However, ER-phagy/nucleophagy cargos fail to reach the vacuole. Instead, nucleus- and cortical-ER-derived membrane structures not enclosed within autophagosomes accumulate in the cytoplasm. This previously unobserved phenotype indicates that ER-phagy/nucleophagy cargo separation from the source compartments is not accompanied by autophagosomal enclosure. We find that the ER-phagy role of Yep1 relies on its abilities to self-interact and shape membranes, and requires its C-terminal amphipathic helices. Moreover, we show that human REEP1-4 and budding yeast Atg40 can functionally substitute for Yep1 in ER-phagy, and Atg40 is a divergent homolog of Yep1 and REEP1-4. Our findings uncover an unexpected mechanism governing the autophagosomal enclosure of ER-phagy/nucleophagy cargos and shed new light on the functions and evolution of REEP family proteins.",

    "abstract": "MAP2 has been widely used as a marker of neuronal dendrites because of its extensive restriction in the somatodendritic region of neurons. Despite that, how the precise localization of such a soluble protein is established and maintained against thermal forces and diffusion has been elusive and long remained a mystery in neuroscience. In this study, we aimed to uncover the mechanism behind how MAP2 is retained in the somatodendritic region. Using GFP-tagged MAP2 expressed in cultured hippocampal neurons, we discovered a crucial protein region responsible for the localization of MAP2, the serine/proline-rich (S/P) region. Our pulse-chase live-cell imaging revealed the slow but steady migration of MAP2 toward distal dendrites, which was not observed in a MAP2 mutant lacking the S/P region, indicating that S/P-dependent transport is vital for the proper localization of MAP2. Furthermore, our experiments using an inhibitor of cytoplasmic Dynein, ciliobrevin D, as well as Dynein knockdown, showed that cytoplasmic Dynein is involved in the transport of MAP2 in dendrites. We also found that Dynein complex binds to MAP2 through the S/P region in heterologous cells. Using mathematical modeling based on experimental data, we confirmed that an intermittent active transport mechanism is essential. Thus, we propose that the cytoplasmic Dynein recruits and transports free MAP2 toward distal dendrites, thereby maintaining the precise dendritic localization of MAP2 in neurons. Our findings shed light on the previously unknown mechanism behind MAP2 localization and provide a new direction for soluble protein trafficking research in the field of cell biology of neurons.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThe performances of popular Genome-wide association study (GWAS) models havent been examined yet in a consistent manner under the scenario of genetic admixture, which introduces several challenging aspects such as heterogeneity of minor allele frequency (MAF), a wide spectrum of case-control ratio, and varying effect sizes etc.\n\nMethodsWe generated a cohort of synthetic individuals (N=19,234) that simulates 1) a large sample size; 2) two-way admixture [Native American-European ancestry] and 3) a binary phenotype. We then examined the inflation factors produced by three popular GWAS tools: GMMAT, SAIGE, and Tractor. We also computed power calculations under different MAFs, case-control ratios, and varying ancestry percentages. Then, we employed a cohort of Peruvians (N=249) to further examine the performances of the testing models on 1) real genetic data and 2) small sample sizes. Finally, we validated these findings using an independent Peruvian cohort (N=109) included in 1000 Genome project (1000G).\n\nResultIn the synthetic cohort, SAIGE performed better than GMMAT and Tractor in terms of type-I error rate, especially under severe unbalanced case-control ratio. On the contrary, power analysis identified Tractor as the best method to pinpoint ancestry-specific causal variants, but showed decreased power when no adequate heterogeneity of the true effect sizes was simulated between ancestries. The real Peruvian data showed that Tractor is severely affected by small sample sizes, and produced severely inflated statistics, which we replicated in the 1000G Peruvian cohort.\n\nDiscussionThe current study illustrates the limitations of available GWAS tools under different scenarios of genetic admixture. We urge caution when interpreting results under complex population scenarios.",

In cell-free DNA from neuroblastoma patients with high-risk disease, we found increased 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) deposition on Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) target genes, a finding previously described in the context of bivalent genes. As bivalent genes, defined as genes bearing both activating (H3K4me3) and repressive (H3K27me3) chromatin modifications, have been shown to play an important role in development and cancer, we investigated the potential role of bivalent genes in maintaining a de-differentiated state in neuroblastoma and their potential use as a biomarker. We identified 313 genes that bore bivalent chromatin marks, were enriched for mediators of neuronal differentiation, and were transcriptionally repressed across a panel of heterogenous neuroblastoma cell lines. Through gene set variance analysis, we developed a clinically implementable bivalent signature. In three distinct clinical cohorts, low bivalent signature was significantly and independently associated with worse clinical outcome in high-risk neuroblastoma patients. Thus, low expression of bivalent genes is a biomarker of ultra-high-risk disease and may represent a therapeutic opportunity in neuroblastoma.",

    "abstract": "In layer 5 of the neocortex, ACh promotes cortical output to the thalamus and brainstem by preferentially enhancing the postsynaptic excitability of pyramidal tract (PT) neurons relative to neighboring intratelencephalic (IT) neurons. Less is known about how ACh regulates the excitatory synaptic drive of IT and PT neurons. To address this question, spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic potentials (sEPSPs) were recorded in pairs of IT and PT neurons in slices of prelimbic cortex from adult female and male mice. ACh (20 {micro}M) enhanced sEPSP amplitudes, frequencies, rise-times, and half-widths preferentially in PT neurons. These effects were blocked by the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist atropine (1 {micro}M). When challenged with pirenzepine (1 {micro}M), an antagonist selective for M1-type muscarinic receptors, ACh instead reduced sEPSP frequencies. The cholinergic increase in sEPSP amplitudes and frequencies in PT neurons was not sensitive to blockade of GABAergic receptors with gabazine (10 {micro}M) and CGP52432 (2.5 {micro}M), but was blocked by tetrodotoxin (1 {micro}M), suggesting that ACh enhances action-potential-dependent excitatory synaptic transmission in PT neurons. ACh also preferentially promoted the occurrence of synchronous sEPSPs in pairs of PT neurons relative to IT-PT and IT-IT pairs. Finally, selective chemogenetic silencing of hM4Di-expressing PT, but not IT, neurons with clozapine-N-oxide (5 {micro}M) blocked cholinergic enhancement of sEPSP amplitudes and frequencies in PT neurons. These data suggest that, in addition to enhancing the postsynaptic excitability of PT neurons, M1 receptor activation promotes corticofugal output by preferentially amplifying recurrent excitation within networks of PT neurons.",

    "abstract": "The Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) mediates epigenetic maintenance of gene silencing in eukaryotes via methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27). This complex interacts with sets of accessory factors to form two distinct subtypes, PRC2.1 and PRC2.2, that differ in their actions and chromatin targeting mechanisms. The underlying molecular mechanisms orchestrating PRC2 assembly are not yet fully understood. Here, we report that alternative splicing (AS) of the PRC2 core component SUZ12 generates an uncharacterised isoform SUZ12-S, which co-exists with the canonical SUZ12-L isoform in the same cell in virtually all tissues and developmental stages. We show that SUZ12-S drives PRC2.1 subtype formation and favours PRC2 dimerisation. While SUZ12-S is necessary and sufficient to ensure correct repression of Polycomb target genes via promoter-proximal H3K27me3 deposition, SUZ12-L is needed for maintaining global H3K27 methylation levels. Lastly, we show that mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) lacking either of the two isoforms have a slower exit from pluripotency upon differentiation stimulus. Our findings thus reveal a physiological mechanism regulating PRC2 assembly and higher-order interactions, with impacts on H3K27 methylation and gene repression.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWIn recent years, the study of hybridization and introgression has made significant progress, with ghost introgression - the transfer of genetic material from extinct or unsampled lineages to extant species - emerging as a key area for research. Accurately identifying ghost introgression, however, presents a challenge. To address this issue, we focused on simple cases involving three species with a known phylogenetic tree. Using mathematical analyses and simulations, we evaluated the performance of popular phylogenetic methods, including HyDe and PhyloNet/MPL, and the full-likelihood method, Bayesian Phylogenetics and Phylogeography (BPP), in detecting ghost introgression. Our findings suggest that heuristic approaches relying on site patterns or gene tree topologies struggle to differentiate ghost introgression from introgression between sampled non-sister species, frequently leading to incorrect identification of donor and recipient species. The full-likelihood method BPP using multilocus sequence alignments, by contrast, is capable of detecting ghost introgression in phylogenomic datasets. We analyzed a real-world phylogenomic dataset of 14 species of Jaltomata (Solanaceae) to showcase the potential of full-likelihood methods for accurate inference of introgression.",

Identification of TE-derived functional elements, however, has relied on TE annotations in individual species, which limits its scope to relatively intact TE sequences and misses elements derived from evolutionarily old TEs. Here, we report a novel approach to uncover previously unannotated degenerate TEs (degTEs) by probing multiple ancestral genomes reconstructed from hundreds of species. We applied this method to the human genome and discovered 1,452,810 degTEs, representing a 10.8% increase over the most recent human TE coverage. Further, we discovered that degTEs contribute to various cis-regulatory elements as well as transcription factor binding sites, including those of a known TE-controlling family, the KRAB zinc-finger proteins. We also report unannotated chimeric transcripts between degTEs and human genes expressed in embryos. This study provides a novel methodology and a freely available resource that will facilitate the investigation of TE co-option events on a full scale.",

    "abstract": "Ankle dorsiflexion function during swing phase of the gait cycle contributes to foot clearance and plays an important role in walking ability post-stroke. Commonly used biomechanical measures such as foot clearance and ankle joint excursion have limited ability to accurately evaluate dorsiflexor function in stroke gait. We retrospectively evaluated ankle angular velocity and ankle angular acceleration as direct measures for swing phase dorsiflexor function in post-stroke gait of 61 chronic stroke survivors. Our linear regression models revealed that peak ankle angular velocity (AAVP), peak ankle angular acceleration (AAAP), peak dorsiflexion angle (DFAP) and peak foot clearance (FCLP) during swing had a significant relationship (p < 0.05) with impaired dorsiflexion function. AAAP and DFAP accounted for the most variance of dorsiflexion function. Additionally, AAVP, AAAP, FCLP during swing, correlated significantly with all clinical outcome measures of walking ability. DFAP during swing had a positive correlation only with FMA-LE. Post-hoc Williams t-tests, used to compare the magnitude of difference between two non-independent correlations, revealed that the correlation between all clinical measures and DFAP were significantly weaker than with AAVP and AAAP. We also found that correlation between FMA-LE and FCLP was weaker than with AAVP and AAAP. We found an excellent test-retest reliability for both AAVP (ICC = 0.968) and AAAP (ICC = 0.947). These results suggest that DFAP may only be associated with non-task specific isolated dorsiflexion movement, but not during walking. FCLP is associated with dorsiflexion function and walking ability measures but not as strongly as AAVP and AAAP possibly because FCLP is influenced by contribution from hip and knee joint movements during walking. Therefore, we believe that AAVP and AAAP both can be used as reliable measures of impaired dorsiflexion function in post-stroke gait.",

The segmentation of microvascular networks from these 3D image volumes and interpretation of their meaning in the context of physiological and pathological processes unfortunately remains a time consuming and error-prone task. Deep learning has the potential to solve this problem, but current supervised analysis frameworks require human-annotated ground truth labels. To overcome these limitations, we present an unsupervised image-to-image translation deep learning model called the vessel segmentation generative adversarial network (VAN-GAN). VAN-GAN integrates synthetic blood vessel networks that closely resemble real-life anatomy into its training process and learns to replicate the underlying physics of an imaging system in order to learn how to segment vasculature from 3D biomedical images. To demonstrate the potential of VAN-GAN, the framework was applied to the challenge of segmenting vascular networks from images acquired using mesoscopic photoacoustic imaging (PAI). With a variety of in silico, in vitro and in vivo pathophysiological data, including patient-derived breast cancer xenograft models, we show that VAN-GAN facilitates accurate and unbiased segmentation of 3D vascular networks from PAI volumes. By leveraging synthetic data to reduce the reliance on manual labelling, VAN-GAN lower the barriers to entry for high-quality blood vessel segmentation to benefit imaging studies of vascular structure and function.",

Institutional pathology archives contain thousands of paraffinized bone marrow core biopsy tissue specimens, providing a rich resource for studying the intact human bone marrow topography in a variety of physiologic states. Thus, we developed an end-to-end pipeline involving multiparameter whole tissue staining, in situ imaging at single-cell resolution, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based digital image analysis, and then applied it to a cohort of disease-free samples to survey alterations in the hematopoietic topography associated with aging. Our data indicate heterogeneity in marrow adipose tissue (MAT) content within each age group, and an inverse correlation between MAT content and proportions of early myeloid and erythroid precursors, irrespective of age. We identify consistent endosteal and perivascular positioning of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) with medullary localization of more differentiated elements and, importantly, uncover new evidence of aging-associated changes in cellular and vascular morphologies, microarchitectural alterations suggestive of inflammaging, and diminution of a potentially active megakaryocytic niche. Overall, our findings suggest that there is topographic remodeling of human hematopoiesis associated with aging.

Considering the application of EVs in diagnostic and therapeutic fields, it is of extreme importance to establish differentiating methods by which focused EV subclasses are operationally defined. Several differentiation protocols have been proposed; however, they have mainly focused on smaller types of EVs, and the heterogeneous nature of large EVs has not yet been fully explored. In this report, to classify large EVs into subgroups based on their physicochemical properties, we have developed a protocol, named EV differentiation by sedimentation patterns (ESP), in which entities in the crude large EV fraction are first moved through a density gradient of iodixanol with small centrifugation forces, and then the migration patterns of molecules through the gradients are analyzed using a non-hierarchical data clustering algorithm. Based on this method, proteins in the large EV fractions of oral fluids clustered into three groups: proteins shared with small EV cargos and enriched in immuno-related proteins (Group 1), proteins involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis (Group 2), and proteins required for vesicle trafficking (Group 3). These observations indicate that the physiochemical properties of EVs, which are defined through low-speed gradient centrifugation, are well associated with their functions within cells. This protocol enables the detailed subclassification of EV populations that are difficult to differentiate using conventional separation methods.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental assumption of functional ecology is that functional traits determine life-histories. Yet correlations between traits and life-history components are often weak, especially for long lived plants. This is because trade-offs, constraints, dynamic resource budgets and the scaling from single organs to entire plants cause complex relationships between traits and life-history. To elucidate these relationships, we present an integrated Trait-Resource-Life-History (TRL) framework that infers how functional traits affect organ-level costs and benefits of different life history components, how these costs and benefits shape the dynamics of whole-plant resource acquisition and allocation, and how these dynamics translate into life history. We illustrate this framework by developing a TRL model for a functionally diverse group of woody plants (22 species of the genus Protea from the South African Greater Cape Floristic Region). Using hierarchical Bayesian latent state-space modelling, we statistically parameterise this model from data on year-to-year variation in growth, reproduction and maternal care (serotiny) for 600 individuals. The parameterised model reveals that higher resource acquisition translates into both larger absolute resource pools and greater proportional resource allocation to reproduction. Accordingly, specific leaf area, a key trait increasing resource acquisition, is associated with larger resource pools, an earlier age of maturity as well as increased vegetative and reproductive performance at young to intermediate ages. In contrast, seed nitrogen content has opposing effects on the benefits of different organs and thus only shows weak correlations with life-history components. Importantly, the TRL model identifies trait and resource-mediated trade-offs at the level of organs, whole-plant resource budgets and life-histories. It can thus quantify key components of life-history theory that are so far largely inaccessible for long-lived plants. This permits novel insights into ecological and evolutionary mechanisms shaping life-histories. Application of the proposed framework to a broad range of plant systems should be facilitated by the increasing availability of trait and demographic data, whole-plant phenotyping and high resolution remote sensing. The integration of the TRL framework with models of biotic interactions further holds promise for a resource-based understanding of community dynamics across trophic levels and a closer integration of functional ecology, evolutionary ecology, community ecology and ecosystem science.",

This has made it difficult to fully explain the biological ageing process from first principles with a single definition. Lacking a clear description of the underlying root cause of biological age confounds clarity in this critical field. In this paper, we demonstrate that the epigenetic system has a built-in, unavoidable fidelity limitation and consequently demonstrate that there is a distinct class of DNA methylation loci that increases in variance in a manner tightly correlated with chronological age. We demonstrate the existence of epigenetic  activation functions and that topological features beyond these activation functions represent deregulation. We show that the measurement of epigenetic fidelity is an accurate predictor of cross-species age and present a deep-learning model that predicts exclusively from knowledge of variance. We find that the classes of epigenetic loci in which variation correlates with chronological age control genes that regulate transcription and suggest that the inevitable consequence of this is a feedback cycle of system-wide deregulation causing a progressive collapse into the phenotype of age. This paper represents a novel theory of biological systemic ageing with arguments as to why, how and when epigenetic ageing is inevitable.",

    "abstract": "Recalling a specific past episode that will enable us to decide which action is suited to a given present situation is a core element of everyday life. A wealth of research has demonstrated that such selective remembering is dependent upon a capacity to inhibit or provisionally  forget related yet inappropriate memory episodes which could orient behavior in unwilled directions. Everyday-like memory (EdM) refers to this type of common organizational mnemonic capacity, known to deteriorate significantly with age, putatively as a result of decline in the cognitive capacity for selective inhibition or  active forgetting. Moreover, this memory retrieval-concomitant active forgetting comes at the cost of genuine amnesic weakening of the inhibited episodes, a phenomenon referred to as retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF). In the present study, we introduce a novel characterization of our previously validated mouse model of EdM in terms of the existing active forgetting and RIF literature. We also introduce novel behavioral analyses of the deliberation processes elicited by EdM challenge and use detailed multi-factorial explorations to reveal how these processes are impacted by age, temporal retention demand, difficulty of EdM challenge, and anticipation of trial outcome. Our observations indicate that deliberation requires remembering while accurate anticipation--in which a critical age-related deficit is also observed--requires active forgetting. Our results represent a significant advance towards unifying our understanding of the neurocognitive processes underpinning everyday-like memory, RIF, mnemonic deliberation, anticipatory function, and how they all are impacted by the physiological ageing process. In parallel, we present preliminary results using a transgenic mouse model which point to a fundamental role for the endocannabinoid system (eCS) in active forgetting and EdM, thereby demonstrating that deeper investigation of previously characterized age-related decline of the eCS should be a pre-clinical priority with a view to developing treatments for age-related decline of EdM function.",

    "abstract": "Biosynthesis of phospholipids is fundamental for membrane biogenesis in all living organisms. As a member of the Glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) Acyltransferase (GPAT) family, PlsB is a crucial enzyme catalyzing the first step of phospholipid synthesis by converting G3P and fatty acyl-coenzyme A (CoA)/acyl-carrier protein (ACP) into lysophosphatidic acid and free CoA (CoASH)/ACP. In bacterial cells, PlsB participates in the formation of persister cells related to multidrug tolerance, and is hence considered as a potential target for anti-persister therapy. By using the single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) method, we have solved the structure of full-length PlsB from Themomonas haemolytica (ThPlsB) at 2.79 [A] resolution. The ThPlsB protein forms a homodimer with C2 symmetry and each monomer contains three distinct domains, namely the amino-terminal domain (NTD), the middle catalytic domain (MCD) and the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD). For the first time, we have unraveled the binding sites of a fatty acyl-CoA and a 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (DOPA) molecule in the MCD of PlsB. The interactions between ThPlsB and the membrane involve two surface-exposed amphipathic regions located in the NTD and MCD respectively. The results of structural and biochemical analyses suggest a membrane surface association-catalysis coupling model for the PlsB-mediated biosynthesis of lysophosphatidic acid occurring at the membrane-cytosol interface.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors is significantly influenced by the Tumor Immune Microenvironment (TIME). RNA sequencing of tumor biopsies or surgical specimens can offer valuable insights into TIME, but its high cost and long turnaround time seriously restrict its utility in routine clinical examinations. Recent studies have suggested that ultra-high resolution pathological images can infer cellular and molecular characteristics. Motivated by this, we propose a weakly supervised contrastive learning model to deduce tumor microenvironment features from whole slide images (WSIs) of H&E stained pathological sections. The high-resolution WSIs are split into tiles, and then contrastive learning is applied to extract features of each tile. Following the aggregation of tile-level features, weak supervisory signals are used to fine-tune the encoder. Comprehensive downstream experiments on two independent cohorts and spatial transcriptomics data corroborate that the computational pathological features effectively characterize the proportion of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, immune subtypes, and biomarker gene expression levels. These findings demonstrate that our model can effectively capture pathological features beyond human vision, establishing a mapping relationship between cellular compositions and histological morphology and thereby expanding the clinical practice of digital pathology images.",

    "abstract": "Next generation sequencing (NGS) has become a standard tool in the molecular diagnostics of Mendelian disease, and the precision of such diagnostics is greatly affected by the accuracy of variant calling from sequencing data. Recently, we have made a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of multiple variant calling pipelines, showing that state-of-the-art neural network-based methods show the best accuracy of variant discovery in the coding genome. In this work, we systematically evaluated the effects of adapters on the performance of variant calling tools using standard reference Genome-in-a-Bottle (GIAB) samples. We show that adapter trimming has no effect on the accuracy of the best-performing variant callers (e.g., DeepVariant) on whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. For whole-exome sequencing (WES) datasets subtle improvement of accuracy was observed in some of the samples. In high-coverage WES data ([~]200x mean coverage), adapter removal allowed for discovery of 2-4 additional true positive variants in only two out of seven datasets tested. Moreover, this effect was not dependent on the median insert size and proportion of adapter sequences in reads. Surprisingly, the effect of trimming on variant calling was reversed when moderate coverage ([~]80-100x) WES data was used. Finally, we show that some of the recently developed machine learning-based variant callers demonstrate greater dependence on the presence of adapters in reads. Taken together, our results indicate that adapter removal is unnecessary when calling germline variants, but suggest that preprocessing methods should be carefully chosen when developing and using machine learning-based variant analysis methods.",

    "abstract": "Many recently proposed structure-based virtual screening models appear to be able to accurately distinguish high affinity binders from non-binders. However, several recent studies have shown that they often do so by exploiting ligand-specific biases in the dataset, rather than identifying favourable intermolecular interactions in the input protein-ligand complex. In this work we propose a novel approach for assessing the extent to which machine learningbased virtual screening models are able to identify the functional groups responsible for binding. To sidestep the difficulty in establishing the ground truth importance of each atom of a large scale set of protein-ligand complexes, we propose a protocol for generating synthetic data where the label of an example is assigned by a 3-dimensional deterministic binding rule. This allows us to precisely quantify the ground truth importance of each atom and compare it to the model generated attributions.\n\nUsing our generated datasets, we demonstrate that a recently proposed deep learning-based virtual screening model, PointVS, identified the most important functional groups with 39% more efficiency than a fingerprint-based random forest, suggesting that it would generalise more effectively to new examples.\n\nIn addition, we found that ligand-specific biases, such as those present in widely used virtual screening datasets, substantially impaired the ability of all ML models to identify the most important functional groups.\n\nWe have made our synthetic data generation framework available to facilitate the benchmarking of new virtual screening models.

    "abstract": "In modern biology, new knowledge is generated quickly, making it challenging for researchers to efficiently acquire and synthesise new information from the large volume of primary publications. To address this problem, computational approaches that generate machine-readable representations of scientific findings in the form of knowledge graphs have been developed. These representations can integrate different types of experimental data from multiple papers and biological knowledge bases in a unifying data model, providing a complementary method to manual review for interacting with published knowledge. The Gene Ontology Consortium (GOC) has created a semantic modelling framework that extends individual functional gene annotations to structured descriptions of causal networks representing biological processes (Gene Ontology Causal Activity Modelling, or GO-CAM). In this study, we explored whether the GO-CAM framework could represent knowledge of the causal relationships between environmental inputs, neural circuits and behavior in the model nematode C. elegans (C. elegans Neural Circuit Causal Activity Modelling (CeN-CAM)). We found that, given extensions to several relevant ontologies, a wide variety of author statements from the literature about the neural circuit basis of egg-laying and carbon dioxide (CO2) avoidance behaviors could be faithfully represented with CeN-CAM. Through this process, we were able to generate generic data models for several categories of experimental results. We also generated representations of multisensory integration and sensory adaptation, and we discuss how semantic modelling may be used to functionally annotate the C. elegans connectome. Thus, Gene Ontology-based semantic modelling has the potential to support various machine-readable representations of neurobiological knowledge.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=103 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/538760v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (11K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5c138org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d047a5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10fbb2forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ca3c71_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

As experimental design complexity and sample numbers continue to increase in single-cell datasets, so does the need for generalizable methods to decipher cell-cell communication in such scenarios.

Additionally, thinning removes large portions of the specimen, restricting the imageable volume to the thickness of the final lamella, typically < 300 nm. Here, we introduce Serial Lift-Out, an enhanced lift-out technique that increases throughput and obtainable contextual information by preparing multiple sections from single transfers.

Mining existing data from ovarian carcinomas, we defined the BMP pathway among the key pathways enriched in tumours with elevated EMT signatures, with a significant correlation in the expression of EMT markers with BMP ligands and downstream targets of the BMP pathway. Functional inhibition of the BMP pathway in ovarian cancer cells by a small molecule inhibitor, DMH1, resulted in impaired migration and depressed EMT signatures in both in vitro and in vivo models. Finally, ectopic induction of EMT in ovarian cancer cells through activation of an independent pathway, TNF, resulted in the selective induction of Smad-mediated BMP pathway suggesting a role in maintenance of EMT, secondary to EMT induction.",

    "abstract": "Radiation-induced cell death is a complex process influenced by physical, chemical and biological phenomena. Strong dose gradient may intensify the complexity and reportedly creates significantly more cell death known as bystander effect. Although consensus on the nature and the mechanism of the bystander effect were not yet made, the immune process presumably plays an important role in many aspects of the radiotherapy including the bystander effect. Immune response of host body and immune suppression of tumor cells are modelled with four compartments in this study; viable tumor cells, T cell lymphocytes, immune triggering cells, and doomed cells. The growth of tumor was analyzed in two distinctive modes of tumor status (immune limited and immune escape) and its bifurcation condition. Tumors in the immune limited mode can grow only up to a finite size, named as terminal tumor volume analytically calculated from the model. The dynamics of the tumor growth in the immune escape mode is much more complex than the tumors in the immune limited mode especially when the status of tumor is close to the bifurcation condition. Radiation can kill tumor cells not only by radiation damage but also by boosting immune reaction. The model demonstrated that the highly heterogeneous dose distribution in spatially fractionated radiotherapy (SFRT) can make a drastic difference in tumor cell killing compared to the homogeneous dose distribution. SFRT can not only enhance but also moderate the cell killing depending on the immune response triggered by many factors such as dose prescription parameters, tumor volume at the time of treatment and tumor characteristics. The model was applied to the lifted data of 67NR tumors on mice and a sarcoma patient treated multiple times over 1200 days for the treatment of tumor recurrence as a demonstration.",

    "abstract": "RationalIn endothermic animals, body temperature (BT) is an evolutionary conserved and well characterized physical parameter that guarantees physiological functioning state. It results from the sum of bioenergetic processes of the body weighted by behavioral strategies, heat loss, and thermolytic processes. However, the intrinsic impact of temperature and temperature changes on the biology is far less understood. To date, the modification of the environmental temperature has constituted the main lever to evaluate the impact of thermic changes in small animal. However, studying intrinsic effect of temperature remains impossible using conventional laboratory equipment, mainly because hypothalamus instructed with information grabbed from the environmental temperature finely regulates and maintain body temperature around 37{degrees}C. Numerous pharmacological treatments have been used to block these thermoregulatory mechanisms, but confer high toxicity while dysregulating the central nervous responses and can potentially have confounding direct effects on studied peripheral tissues. Alternatively, physical methods using energy irradiation were reported, but they remain expensive and usually involve animal immobilization. We aimed at designing a simple and affordable device to adjust and maintain body temperature on the long course in conscious and free-moving animals.\n\nMethodWe developed an electromagnetic LC resonant circuit (ELM circuit) producing a radio frequency signal (64 kHz) inside a copper coil refrigerated with a water circuit. This setting is powered by a simple a 0-48V AC generator, allowing the use of a domestic electrical network. This setting can accommodate metal-free 3D-printed circular cages, where adult mice, previously implanted with thermometric ID transponders, are monitored remotely for intraperitoneal temperature over time.\n\nResultsThe BT of mice placed in the ELM circuit could be regulated in a reproducible fashion. Healthy mice increased their BT from 37 to 39.8{+/-}1{degrees}C, upon power supply ranging from 0 to 48V, respectively. In septic mice developing hypothermia (33{+/-}1 {degrees}C), BT could be either normalized to normothermia (37{degrees}C, 24V), or increased to fever-range hyperthermia (40{degrees}C, 48V) as a function of radiofrequency energy. BT tuning was accurate and stable for at least 12h. Blood count after 6 or 12 hours showed no modifications between groups, cardiomyocyte displayed heat shock response within the first hour in mice exposed to the maximal dose (BT=41{degrees}C). MALDI TOF imaging on brain microsections revealed modifications of the brain proteome, as suggested by differential PKC-theta, and prolactin 7B1 load in heated mice, as compared to controls.\n\nConclusionPrecise body temperature tuning is achievable in small animals, and could be of high interest to understand the impact of temperature in (patho)physiology.",

    "abstract": "Brain stimulation has become an important treatment option for a variety of neurological and psychiatric diseases. A key challenge in improving brain stimulation is selecting the optimal set of stimulation parameters for each patient, as parameter spaces are too large for brute-force search and their induced effects can exhibit complex subject-specific behavior. To achieve greatest effectiveness, stimulation parameters may additionally need to be adjusted based on an underlying neural state, which may be unknown, unmeasurable, or challenging to quantify a priori. In this study, we first develop a simulation of a state-dependent brain stimulation experiment using rodent optogenetic stimulation data. We then use this simulation to demonstrate and evaluate two implementations of an adaptive Bayesian optimization algorithm that can model a dynamically changing response to stimulation parameters without requiring knowledge of the underlying neural state. We show that, while standard Bayesian optimization converges and overfits to a single optimal set of stimulation parameters, adaptive Bayesian optimization can continue to update and explore as the neural state is changing and can provide more accurate optimal parameter estimation when the optimal stimulation parameters shift. These results suggest that learning algorithms such as adaptive Bayesian optimization can successfully find optimal state-dependent stimulation parameters, even when brain sensing and decoding technologies are insufficient to track the relevant neural state.",

    "abstract": "The meningeal space is an important structure in the brain borders, which provides immunosurveillance for the central nervous system, but the impact of infections on the meningeal immune landscape is far from being fully understood. The extracellular protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which causes Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) or sleeping sickness, accumulate in the meningeal spaces, ultimately inducing severe meningitis and resulting in death if left untreated. Thus, sleeping sickness represents an attractive model to study immunological dynamics in the meninges during infection. Here, combining single cell transcriptomics and mass cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF), coupled with in vivo interventions, we found that chronic T. brucei infection triggers the development of ectopic lymphoid aggregates (ELAs) in the murine meninges during chronic infection. These infection-induced ectopic structures are defined by the presence of ER-TR7+ fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) that initiate a signalling cascade driving local T cell activation towards a T follicular helper (TFH)-like phenotype, as well as B cell class switching. Furthermore, the GC-like B cells found in the infected meninges produce high-affinity autoantibodies able to recognise mouse brain antigens. We found that systemic lymphotoxin {beta} (LT{beta}) signalling blockade led to a significant depletion of meningeal FDC-like cells and autoreactive B cells, indicating that LT{beta} signalling is critical to induce and maintain local responses in the meninges. In humans, we identified the presence of autoreactive IgG antibodies able to recognise human brain lysates in the cerebrospinal fluid of second stage HAT patients compared to first stage HAT patients, consistent with our findings in experimental infections. Taken together, our data provide evidence that the meningeal immune response results in the acquisition of lymphoid tissue-like properties during chronic T. brucei infection, broadening our understanding of meningeal immunity in the context of chronic infections. These findings have wider implications for understanding the mechanisms underlying the formation ELAs during chronic inflammation resulting in autoimmunity in mice and humans, as observed in other autoimmune neurodegenerative disorders such as neuropsychiatric lupus and multiple sclerosis.",

Downstream of fate specification, transcriptional mechanisms that drive establishment of epithelial morphology through MET are poorly understood. We used human renal organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, which recapitulate nephrogenesis, to investigate mechanisms controlling the renal MET programme. Multi-ome profiling of organoids revealed dynamic changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility driven by transcriptional activators and repressors throughout renal MET. CRISPR-interference-based gene perturbation revealed that PAX8 is essential for initiation of MET in human renal organoids, contrary to mouse, by activating a cell adhesion programme. Furthermore, while Wnt/{beta}-Catenin signalling specifies nephron fate, we find that it must be attenuated to allow HNF1B and TEAD transcription factors to drive completion of MET. These results reveal how the developing kidney balances fate-commitment and morphogenesis with implications for understanding both developmental kidney diseases and aberrant epithelial plasticity following adult renal tubular injury.",

Mathematical and computational models are essential to unravel the mechanisms of self-organization that underlie the emergence of collective migration from the interactions among individual cells. Recently, guidance-by-followers was identified as one such underlying mechanism of collective cell migration in the zebrafish embryo. This poses the question how guidance stimuli are integrated when multiple cells interact simultaneously. Here, we extend a recent individual-based model by an integration step of the vectorial guidance stimuli and compare model predictions obtained for various variants of the mechanism (arithmetic mean of stimuli, dominance of stimulus with largest transmission interface, dominance of most head-on stimulus). Simulations are carried out and quantified within the modeling and simulation framework Morpheus. Collective cell migration is sfound to be robust and qualitatively identical for all considered variants of stimulus integration. Moreover, this study highlights the role of individual-based modeling approaches for understanding collective phenomena at the population scale that emerge from cell-cell interactions.",

Here, using data on bird species elevational distributions from all 46 of the worlds major mountain ranges, bird species dietary traits, and the distribution of the low-elevation ant genus Oecophylla, we show that global patterns in bird elevational diversity are likely to be affected by competition with ants. Oecophylla is an exceptionally abundant and aggressive predator of invertebrates, which preys on the same species that sympatric invertivorous bird species feed on. In mountain ranges with Oecophylla present in the foothills, maximum species richness of invertivorous birds occurs, on average, at 960m, [~]450m higher than in mountain ranges without Oecophylla. Further, in mountain ranges with Oecophylla, species richness of invertivorous birds increases initially with with elevation to produce a mid-elevation peak in invertivore bird species richness. Where Oecophylla is absent, invertivore bird species richness generally shows monotonic declines with increasing elevation. We attribute the pattern to the following mechanism: first, Oecophylla reduces prey density for invertivorous birds; second, low invertebrate prey abundance reduces invertivorous bird density and third, lower bird density is correlated with lower bird species richness. Because invertivores dominate montane bird communities, global elevational bird diversity patterns are also driven by Oecophylla. The findings emphasize how competitive interactions between distantly related taxa set geographical range limits.",

    "abstract": "Wetlands store 20-30% of the worlds soil carbon, and identifying the microbial controls on these carbon reserves is essential to predicting feedbacks to climate change. Although viral infections likely play important roles in wetland ecosystem dynamics, we lack a basic understanding of wetland viral ecology. Here 63 viral size-fraction metagenomes (viromes) and paired total metagenomes were generated from three time points in 2021 at seven fresh- and saltwater wetlands in the California Bodega Marine Reserve. We recovered 12,826 viral population genomic sequences (vOTUs), 4.4% of which were also detected at the same field site two years prior, indicating a small degree of population stability or recurrence. Viral communities differed most significantly across the seven wetland sites and were also structured by habitat (plant community composition and salinity). Read mapping to a new version of our reference database, PIGEONv2.0 (now with 515,763 vOTUs), revealed 196 vOTUs present over large geographic distances, often reflecting shared habitat characteristics. Wetland vOTU microdiversity was significantly lower locally than globally and lower within than between time points, indicating greater divergence with increasing spatiotemporal distance. Viruses tended to have broad predicted host ranges via CRISPR spacer linkages to metagenome-assembled genomes (whether this reflects true biology remains to be seen), and increased SNP frequencies in CRISPR-targeted major tail protein genes suggest viral eco-evolutionary dynamics, potentially in response to both immune targeting and to changes in host cell receptors involved in viral attachment. Together, these results highlight the importance of dispersal, environmental selection, and eco-evolutionary dynamics as drivers of local and global wetland viral biogeography.",

    "abstract": "Whole genome duplication has long been appreciated for its role in driving phenotypic novelty in plants, often altering the way organisms interface with the abiotic environment. Only recently, however, have we begun to investigate how polyploidy influences interactions of plants with other species, despite the biotic niche being predicted as one of the main determinants of polyploid establishment. Nevertheless, we lack critical information about how polyploidy affects the diversity and composition of the microbial taxa that colonize plants, and whether this is genotype-dependent and repeatable across natural environments. This information is a critical first step toward understanding whether the microbiome contributes to polyploid establishment. We thus tested the immediate effect of polyploidy on the diversity and composition of the bacterial microbiome of the aquatic plant Spirodela polyrhiza using four pairs of diploids and synthetic autotetraploids. Under controlled conditions, axenic plants were inoculated with pond waters collected from 10 field sites across a broad environmental gradient. Autotetraploids hosted 4-11 % greater bacterial taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity than their diploid progenitors. Polyploidy, along with its interactions with the inoculum source and genetic lineage, collectively explained 7 % of the total variation in microbiome composition. Furthermore, polyploidy broadened the core microbiome, with autotetraploids having 15 unique bacterial taxa in addition to the 55 they shared with diploids. Our results show that whole genome duplication directly leads to novelty in plant microbiome and importantly, that the effect is dependent on the genetic ancestry of the polyploid and generalizable over many environmental contexts.",

However, there is considerable evidence that brain activity in these conditions varies according to this cycle, with discrete patterns of dysfunction linked to loss of circadian rhythmicity, worse clinical outcomes and impaired patient quality of life. We present a targeted concept of circadian neuromodulation using a novel device platform. This system utilises stimulation of circuits important in sleep and wake regulation, delivering bioelectronic cues (Zeitgebers) aimed at entraining rhythms to more physiological patterns in a personalised and fully configurable manner. Preliminary evidence from its first use in a clinical trial setting, with brainstem arousal circuits as a surgical target, further supports its promising impact on sleep/wake pathology. Data included in this paper highlight its versatility and effectiveness on two different patient phenotypes. In addition to exploring acute and long-term electrophysiological and behavioural effects, we also discuss current caveats and future feature improvements of our proposed system, as well as its potential applicability in modifying disease progression in future therapies.",

    "abstract": "Standard-of-care treatment regimes have long been designed to for maximal cell kill, yet these strategies often fail when applied to treatment-resistant tumors, resulting in patient relapse. Adaptive treatment strategies have been developed as an alternative approach, harnessing intra-tumoral competition to suppress the growth of treatment resistant populations, to delay or even prevent tumor progression. Following recent clinical implementations of adaptive therapy, it is of significant interest to optimise adaptive treatment protocols. We propose the application of deep reinforcement learning models to provide generalised solutions within adaptive drug scheduling, and demonstrate this framework can outperform the current adaptive protocols, extending time to progression by up to a quarter. This strategy is robust to varying model parameterisations, and the underlying tumor model. We demonstrate the deep learning framework can produce interpretable, adaptive strategies based on a single tumor burden threshold, replicating and informing a novel, analytically-derived optimal treatment strategy with no knowledge of the underlying mathematical tumor model. This approach is highly relevant beyond the simple, analytically-tractable tumor model considered here, demonstrating the capability of deep learning frameworks to help inform and develop treatment strategies in complex settings. Finally, we propose a pathway to integrate mechanistic modelling with DRL to tailor generalist treatment strategies to individual patients in the clinic, generating personalised treatment schedules that consistently outperform clinical standard-of-care protocols.",

    "abstract": "Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is one of the most aggressive and lethal tumor types, characterized by loss of differentiation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, extremely high proliferation rate, and generalized resistance to therapy. To identify novel relevant, targetable molecular alterations, we analyzed gene expression profiles from a genetically engineered ATC mouse model and from human patient datasets, and found consistent upregulation of genes encoding enzymes involved in the one-carbon metabolic pathway, which uses serine and folates to generate both nucleotides and glycine.\n\nGenetic and pharmacological inhibition of SHMT2, a key enzyme of the mitochondrial arm of the one-carbon pathway, rendered ATC cells glycine auxotroph and led to significant inhibition of cell proliferation and colony forming ability, which was primarily caused by depletion of the purine pool. Notably, these growth-suppressive effects were significantly amplified when cells were grown in the presence of physiological types and levels of folates. Genetic depletion of SHMT2 dramatically impaired tumor growth in vivo, both in xenograft models and in an immunocompetent allograft model of ATC.\n\nTogether, these data establish the upregulation of the one-carbon metabolic pathway as a novel and targetable vulnerability of ATC cells, which can be exploited for therapeutic purposes.",

However, the identities of the assembled tau species and the EVs, as well as how they associate, are not known. Here, we combined quantitative mass spectrometry, cryo-electron tomography and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy to study brain EVs from AD patients. We found filaments of truncated tau enclosed within EVs enriched in endo-lysosomal proteins. We observed multiple filament interactions, including with molecules that tethered filaments to the EV limiting membrane, suggesting selective packaging.

Modern platforms can automate collection of high-throughput microbial growth curves, necessitating the development of computational tools to handle and analyze these data to produce insights. However, existing tools are limited. Many use parametric analyses that require mathematical assumptions about the microbial growth characteristics. Those that use non-parametric or model-free analyses often can only quantify a few traits of interest, and none are capable of importing and reshaping all known growth curve data formats. To address this gap, here I present a newly-developed R package: gcplyr. gcplyr can flexibly import growth curve data in every known format, and reshape it under a flexible and extendable framework so that users can design custom analyses or plot data with popular visualization packages. gcplyr can also incorporate metadata and generate or import experimental designs to merge with data. Finally, gcplyr carries out model-free and non-parametric analyses, extracting a broad range of clinically and ecologically important traits, including initial density, lag time, growth rate and doubling time, carrying capacity, diauxie, area under the curve, extinction time, and more. In sum, gcplyr makes scripted analysis of growth curve data in R straightforward, streamlines common data wrangling and analysis steps, and easily integrates with common visualization and statistical analyses.",

A conserved class of HP1 proteins are critically required to establish and maintain heterochromatin. HP1 proteins bind to H3K9me, recruit factors that promote heterochromatin formation, and oligomerize to form phase-separated condensates. We do not understand how HP1 protein binding to heterochromatin establishes and maintains transcriptional silencing. Here, we demonstrate that the S.pombe HP1 homolog, Swi6, can be completely bypassed to establish silencing at ectopic and endogenous loci when an H3K4 methyltransferase, Set1 and an H3K14 acetyltransferase, Mst2 are deleted. Deleting Set1 and Mst2 enhances Clr4 enzymatic activity, leading to higher H3K9me levels and increased spreading. In contrast, Swi6 and its capacity to oligomerize were indispensable during epigenetic maintenance. Our results demonstrate the role of HP1 proteins in regulating histone modification crosstalk during establishment and identifies a genetically separable function in maintaining epigenetic memory.",

The structure reveals conformation of the structure motifs in the active site of Pol V that accounts for its inferior RNA-extension ability. The structure further reveals structural features of Pol V that prevent it from interacting with the general transcription factors of Pol II and Pol IV. The KOW5 domain of KTF1 binds near the RNA exit channel of Pol V, where it provides a scaffold for the proposed recruitment of Argonaute proteins to initiate the assembly of DNA methylation machinery.

    "abstract": "Catalytic RNAs or ribozymes are considered to be central to primordial biology. Most ribozymes require moderate to high concentrations of divalent cations such as Mg2+ to fold into their catalytically competent structures and perform catalysis. However, undesirable effects of Mg2+ such as hydrolysis of reactive RNA building blocks and degradation of RNA structures are likely to undermine its beneficial roles in ribozyme catalysis. Further, prebiotic cell-like compartments bounded by fatty acid membranes are destabilized in the presence of Mg2+, making ribozyme function inside prebiotically relevant protocells a significant challenge. Therefore, we sought to identify conditions that would enable ribozymes to retain activity in low concentrations of Mg2+. Inspired by the ability of ribozymes to function inside crowded cellular environments with <1 mM free Mg2+, we tested molecular crowding as a potential mechanism to lower the Mg2+ concentration required for ribozyme-catalyzed RNA assembly. Here, we show that the ribozyme-catalyzed ligation of phosphorimidazolide RNA substrates is significantly enhanced in the presence of the artificial crowding agent polyethylene glycol. We also found that molecular crowding preserves ligase activity under denaturing conditions such as alkaline pH and the presence of urea. We also show that crowding-induced stimulation of RNA-catalyzed RNA assembly is not limited to phosphorimidazolide ligation but extends to the RNA-catalyzed polymerization of nucleoside triphosphates. RNA-catalyzed RNA ligation is also stimulated by the presence of prebiotically relevant small molecules such as ethylene glycol, ribose, and amino acids, consistent with a role for molecular crowding in primordial ribozyme function and more generally, in the emergence of RNA-based cellular life.\n\nTable of Contents Graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=94 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/538884v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (19K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17d282borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d8531aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1380f7borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@180708f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG SYNOPSISMolecular crowding enables ribozyme-catalyzed RNA assembly under low Mg2+ conditions, and consequently may have played an essential role in the origin and evolution of RNA-based primordial life.",

The diameter of these microgels directly determines the size of the interconnected void space between particles where infiltrating or encapsulated cells reside. This tunable porosity allows us to use MAP scaffolds to study the impact of spatial confinement (SC) on both cellular behaviors and the host response to biomaterials. Despite previous studies showing that pore size and SC influence cellular phenotypes, including mitigating the macrophage inflammatory response, there is still a gap in knowledge regarding how SC within a biomaterial modulates immune cell recruitment in vivo in wounds and implants. Thus, we studied the immune cell profile within confined and unconfined biomaterials using small (40 m), medium (70 m), and large (130 m) diameter spherical microgels, respectively. We discovered that MAP scaffolds imparted regenerative wound healing with an IgG1-biased Th2 response.

Both wild type and truncated mutants of GES (without signal peptide targeting chloroplast) were examined by co-expressing with MVA pathway enzymes tHMG1 and IDI1. Truncated CrGES (tCrGES) produced the most geraniol and thus was used for further experimentation. The initial strain was obtained by overexpression of the truncated HMG1, IDI and tCrGES. The acetyl-CoA precursor pool was enhanced by overexpressing mevalonate pathway genes such as ERG10, HMGS or MVK, PMK. The final strain overexpressing 3 copies of tCrGES and single copies of ERG10, HMGS, tHMG1, IDI produced approximately 1 g/L in shake-flask fermentation.

    "abstract": "A key goal in agriculture is to create pathogen-resistant crop species via breeding or biotechnological approaches. Plant resistance (R) and pathogen avirulence (Avr) gene interactions play a vital role in pathogen resistance. Efficient molecular screening tools for crops lack far behind their model organism counterparts, yet they are essential to rapidly identify agriculturally important molecular interactions that trigger host resistance. To fill this important gap, we have developed a novel wheat protoplast assay that enables efficient screening of Avr/R interactions at scale. Our assay allows access to the extensive gene pool of phenotypically described R genes because it does not require the overexpression of cloned R genes. It is suitable for multiplexed Avr screening, with interactions tested in pools of up to fifty Avr candidates. Our assay is based on newly identified Avr/R-induced defense genes which we used to create promoter-luciferase reporter constructs. We combined these reporter constructs with a synthetic biology based dual-color ratiometric reporter system that normalizes read-outs accounting for experimental variability and Avr/R-induced cell-death. In addition, we introduced a replicon-based plasmid derived from the wheat dwarf virus, which self-replicates in wheat reducing the amount of plasmid used in the assay. Our new assay increases the throughput of Avr candidate screening, accelerating the study of cellular defense signaling and resistance gene identification in wheat. We anticipate that the uptake of our assay by the community will significantly accelerate Avr identification for many wheat pathogens, leading to improved genome-guided pathogen surveillance and breeding of disease-resistant crops.",

    "abstract": "As one of the top value-added chemicals, succinic acid has been the focus of numerous metabolic engineering campaigns since the 1990s. However, microbial production of succinic acid at an industrially relevant scale has been hindered by high downstream processing costs arising from neutral pH fermentation. Here we describe the metabolic engineering of Issatchenkia orientalis, a non-conventional yeast with superior tolerance to highly acidic conditions, for cost-effective succinic acid production. Through deletion of byproduct pathways, transport engineering, and expanding the substrate scope, the resulting strains could produce succinic acid at the highest titers in sugar-based media at low pH (pH 3) in fed-batch fermentations using bench-top reactors, i.e. 109.5 g/L in minimal medium and 104.6 g/L in sugarcane juice medium. We further performed batch fermentation in a pilot-scale fermenter with a scaling factor of 300x, achieving 63.1 g/L of succinic acid using sugarcane juice medium. A downstream processing comprising of two-stage vacuum distillation and crystallization enabled direct recovery of succinic acid, without further acidification of fermentation broth, with an overall yield of 64.0%. Finally, we simulated an end-to-end low-pH succinic acid production pipeline, and techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment indicate our process is financially viable and can reduce life cycle greenhouse gas emissions by 34-90% relative to fossil-based production processes. We expect I. orientalis can serve as a general industrial platform for the production of a wide variety of organic acids.",

    "abstract": "Model development is essential to gain a mathematical understanding of the underlying phenomena in systems biology. In most models, it is typically hard to estimate the values of the biophysical/phenomenological parameters that characterize the model. The parameters are estimated by minimizing a function that reduces a measure of the error between model predictions and experimental data. In this work, we build on an algorithm for function minimization proposed by Runnarson and Yao, named Improved Evolutionary Strategy by Stochastic Ranking (ISRES), that finds a best-fit individual by evolving a population in the direction of minimizing error by using information at most from a pair of individuals in any generation to create a new population. Our algorithm, named ISRES+, builds on it by combining information from all individuals across the population and across all generations to gain a better sense of direction to evolve the population. ISRES+ makes use of the additional information generated by the creation of a large population in the evolutionary methods to approximate the local neighborhood around the best-fit individual using linear least squares fit in one and two dimensions. We compared the performance of the two algorithms on three systems biology models with varying complexities and found that not only does the ISRES+ lead to fitter individuals, but it also leads to a tighter distribution of fittest individuals over successive runs.",

In allo-HCT, intestinal damage is an important factor in the development of Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD), an immune complication in which donor immune cells attack the recipients tissues. Here, we developed a novel human intestinal organoid-based 3D model system to study the direct effect of chemotherapy-induced intestinal epithelial damage on T cell behavior. Chemotherapy treatment using busulfan, fludarabine, and clofarabine led to damage responses in organoids resulting in increased T cell migration, activation, and proliferation in ex-vivo co-culture assays. We identified galectin-9 (Gal-9), a beta-galactoside-binding lectin released by damaged organoids, as a key molecule mediating T cell responses to damage. Increased levels of Gal-9 were also found in the plasma of allo-HCT patients who later developed acute GVHD, supporting the predictive value of the model system in the clinical setting. This study highlights the potential contribution of chemotherapy-induced epithelial damage to the pathogenesis of intestinal GVHD through direct effects on T cell activation and trafficking promoted by galectin-9.",

    "abstract": "Stomata are epidermal pores that facilitate plant gas exchange. Grasses have fast stomatal movements, likely due to their dumbbell-shaped guard cells and lateral subsidiary cells. Subsidiary cells reciprocally exchange water and ions with guard cells. However, the relative contribution of subsidiary cells to stomatal closure is unresolved. We compared stomatal gas exchange and stomatal aperture dynamics in wild type and pan1, pan2, and pan1;pan2 maize (Zea mays) mutants, which have varying percentages of aberrantly formed subsidiary cells. Stomata with 1 or 2 defective subsidiary cells cannot close properly, indicating that subsidiary cells are essential for stomatal function. Even though the percentage of aberrant stomata is similar in pan1 and pan2, pan2 showed a more severe defect in stomatal closure. In pan1, only stomata with abnormal subsidiary cells fail to close normally. In pan2, all stomata have stomatal closure defects, indicating that PAN2 has an additional role in stomatal closure. Maize Pan2 is orthologous to Arabidopsis thaliana GHR1, which is also required for stomatal closure. PAN2 acts downstream of Ca2+ in maize to promote stomatal closure. This is in contrast to GHR1, which acts upstream of Ca2+, and indicates differently wired pathways in maize and Arabidopsis.",
