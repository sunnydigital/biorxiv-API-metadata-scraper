    "abstract": "Stargardt disease is a currently untreatable, inherited neurodegenerative disease that leads to macular degeneration and blindness due to loss-of-function mutations in the ABCA4 gene. We have designed a dual adeno-associated viral vector split-intein adenine base-editing strategy to correct the most common mutation in ABCA4 (c.5882G>A, p.G1961E). We optimized ABCA4 base editing in human models, including retinal organoids, iPSC-derived retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, as well as adult human retinal- and RPE/choroid explants in vitro. The resulting gene therapy vectors achieved high levels of gene correction in mutation-carrying mice and in non-human primates, with an average editing of 37% of photoreceptors and 73% of RPE cells in vivo. The high editing rates in primates make way for precise and efficient gene editing in other neurodegenerative ocular diseases.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that perceptual and cognitive functions are codetermined by rhythmic bodily states. Prior investigations have focused on the cardiac and respiratory rhythms, both of which are also known to synchronise with locomotion - arguably our most common and natural of voluntary behaviours. Unlike the cardiorespiratory rhythms, walking is entirely under voluntary control, enabling a test of how natural and voluntary rhythmic action may affect sensory function. Here, we show that the speed and phase of human locomotion constrains sensorimotor performance. We used a continuous visuo-motor tracking task in a wireless, body-tracking virtual environment, and found that the accuracy and reaction time of continuous reaching movements were decreased at slower walking speeds, and rhythmically modulated according to the phases of the step-cycle. Decreased accuracy when walking at slow speeds suggests an advantage for interlimb coordination at normal walking speeds, in contrast to previous research on dual-task walking and reach-to-grasp movements. Phasic modulations of reach precision within the step-cycle also suggest that the upper limbs are affected by the ballistic demands of motor-preparation during natural locomotion. Together these results show that the natural phases of human locomotion impose constraints on sensory function and demonstrate the value of examining dynamic and natural behaviour in contrast to the traditional and static methods of psychological science.",

    "abstract": "RhoA plays a crucial role in neuronal polarization, where its action restraining axon outgrowth has been thoroughly studied. We now report that RhoA has not only inhibitory but also a stimulatory effect on axon development depending on when and where exerts its action and the downstream effectors involved. In cultured hippocampal neurons, FRET imaging revealed that RhoA activity selectively localizes in growth cones of undifferentiated neurites, while in developing axons it displays a biphasic pattern, being low in nascent axons and high in elongating ones. RhoA-Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling prevents axon initiation but has no effect on elongation, while formin inhibition reduces axon extension without significantly altering initial outgrowth. Besides, RhoA-mDia promotes axon elongation by stimulating growth cone microtubule stability and assembly, as opposed to RhoA-ROCK that restrains growth cone microtubule assembly and protrusion. Finally, we show that similar mechanisms might operate during axonal regeneration, with RhoA-ROCK slowing axon regrowth after axotomy and RhoA-mDia favoring extension of regenerated axons.",

We identify important caveats and strengths for these lines which will provide broad significance for researchers interested in performing conditional gene deletion in microglia.

    "abstract": "The spiking activity of neocortical neurons exhibits a striking level of variability, even when these networks are driven by identical stimuli. The approximately Poisson firing of neurons has led to the hypothesis that these neural networks operate in the asynchronous state. In the asynchronous state neurons fire independently from one another, so that the probability that a neuron experience synchronous synaptic inputs is exceedingly low. While the models of asynchronous neurons lead to observed spiking variability, it is not clear whether the asynchronous state can also account for the level of subthreshold membrane potential variability. We propose a new analytical framework to rigorously quantify the subthreshold variability of a single conductance-based neuron in response to synaptic inputs with prescribed degrees of synchrony. Technically we leverage the theory of exchangeability to model input synchrony via jump-process-based synaptic drives; we then perform a moment analysis of the stationary response of a neuronal model with all-or-none conductances that neglects post-spiking reset. As a result, we produce exact, interpretable closed forms for the first two stationary moments of the membrane voltage, with explicit dependence on the input synaptic numbers, strengths, and synchrony. For biophysically relevant parameters, we find that the asynchronous regime only yields realistic subthreshold variability (voltage variance [~=] 4 - 9mV2) when driven by a restricted number of large synapses, compatible with strong thalamic drive. By contrast, we find that achieving realistic subthreshold variability with dense cortico-cortical inputs requires including weak but nonzero input synchrony, consistent with measured pairwise spiking correlations. We also show that without synchrony, the neural variability averages out to zero for all scaling limits with vanishing synaptic weights, independent of any balanced state hypothesis. This result challenges the theoretical basis for mean-field theories of the asynchronous state.",

    "abstract": "Throughout the day, humans show natural fluctuations in arousal that impact cognitive function. To study the behavioural dynamics of cognitive control during high and low arousal states, healthy participants performed an auditory conflict task during high-intensity physical exercise (N = 39) or drowsiness (N = 33). In line with the pre-registered hypothesis, conflict and conflict adaptation effects were preserved during both altered arousal states. Overall task performance was markedly poorer during low arousal, but not for high arousal. Modelling behavioural dynamics with drift-diffusion analyses revealed evidence accumulation and non-decision time decelerated, and decisional boundaries became wider during low arousal, whereas high arousal was unexpectedly associated with a decrease in the interference of task-irrelevant information processing. These findings show how arousal differentially modulates cognitive control at both sides of normal alertness, and further validates drowsiness and physical exercise as key experimental models to disentangle the interaction between physiological fluctuations on cognitive dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Biophysically detailed neural models are a powerful technique to study neural dynamics in health and disease with a growing number of established and openly available models. A major challenge in the use of such models is that parameter inference is an inherently difficult and unsolved problem. Identifying unique parameter distributions that can account for observed neural dynamics, and differences across experimental conditions, is essential to their meaningful use. Recently, simulation based inference (SBI) has been proposed as an approach to perform Bayesian inference to estimate parameters in detailed neural models. SBI overcomes the challenge of not having access to a likelihood function, which has severely limited inference methods in such models, by leveraging advances in deep learning to perform density estimation. While the substantial methodological advancements offered by SBI are promising, their use in large scale biophysically detailed models is challenging and methods for doing so have not been established, particularly when inferring parameters that can account for time series waveforms. We provide guidelines and considerations on how SBI can be applied to estimate time series waveforms in biophysically detailed neural models starting with a simplified example and extending to specific applications to common MEG/EEG waveforms using the the large scale neural modeling framework of the Human Neocortical Neurosolver. Specifically, we describe how to estimate and compare results from example oscillatory and event related potential simulations. We also describe how diagnostics can be used to assess the quality and uniqueness of the posterior estimates. The methods described provide a principled foundation to guide future applications of SBI in a wide variety of applications that use detailed models to study neural dynamics.\n\nAuthor summaryA central problem in computational neural modeling is estimating model parameters that can account for observed activity patterns. While several techniques exist to perform parameter inference in special classes of abstract neural models, there are comparatively few approaches for large scale biophysically detailed neural models. In this work, we describe challenges and solutions in applying a deep learning based statistical framework to estimate parameters in a biophysically detailed large scale neural model, and emphasize the particular difficulties in estimating parameters for time series data. Our example uses a multi-scale model designed to connect human MEG/EEG recordings to the underlying cell and circuit level generators. Our approach allows for crucial insight into how cell-level properties interact to produce measured neural activity, and provides guidelines for diagnosing the quality of the estimate and uniqueness of predictions for different MEG/EEG biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "Restoring function in chronic stages of spinal cord injury (SCI) has often been met with failure or reduced efficacy when regenerative strategies are delayed past the acute or sub-acute stages of injury. Restoring function in the chronically injured spinal cord remains a critical challenge. We found that a single injection of retrogradely transported adeno-associated viruses (AAVrg) to knockout the phosphatase and tensin homolog protein (PTEN) in chronic SCI can effectively target both damaged and spared axons and restore locomotor functions in near-complete injury models. AAVrgs were injected to deliver cre recombinase and/or a red fluorescent protein (RFP) under the human Synapsin 1 promoter (hSyn1) into the spinal cords of C57BL/6 PTENFlox{Delta}/{Delta} mice to knockout PTEN (PTEN-KO) in a severe thoracic SCI crush model at both acute and chronic time points. PTEN-KO improved locomotor abilities in both acute and chronic SCI conditions over a 9-week period. Regardless of whether treatment was initiated at the time of injury (acute), or three months after SCI (chronic), mice with limited hindlimb joint movement gained hindlimb weight support after treatment. Interestingly, functional improvements were not sustained beyond 9 weeks coincident with a loss of RFP reporter-gene expression and a near-complete loss of treatment-associated functional recovery by 6 months post-treatment. Treatment effects were also specific to severely injured mice; animals with weight support at the time of treatment lost function over a 6-month period. Retrograde tracing with Fluorogold revealed viable neurons throughout the motor cortex despite a loss of RFP expression at 9 weeks post-PTEN-KO. However, few Fluorogold labeled neurons were detected within the motor cortex at 6 months post-treatment. BDA labeling from the motor cortex revealed a dense corticospinal tract (CST) bundle in all groups except chronically treated PTEN-KO mice indicating a potential long-term toxic effect of PTEN-KO to neurons in the motor cortex. PTEN-KO mice had significantly more {beta}-tubulin III labeled axons within the lesion when treatment was delivered acutely, but not chronically post-SCI. In conclusion, we have found that using AAVrgs to knockout PTEN is an effective manipulation capable of restoring motor functions in chronic SCI and can enhance axon growth of currently unidentified axon populations when delivered acutely after injury. However, the long-term consequences of PTEN-KO may exert neurotoxic effects.",

    "abstract": "Neuroplasticity is the ability of the human brain to reorganize and modify its activity throughout life. In congenital deafness, sensory-deprived cortex can be recruited to represent sensory information belonging to other modalities, a process known as cross-modal plasticity. Previous studies have indicated that the auditory cortex of congenitally deaf, but not of hearing individuals, is recruited during visual tasks. However, it is not clear to what extent, and how, these cross-modal responses in the deprived auditory cortex represent low-level visual spatial information or map the visual field. Here, we addressed this question directly in an fMRI case-study, aiming to map retinotopic features in the auditory cortex. Two congenitally deaf and one hearing participant went through a conventional retinotopy fMRI experiment with visual stimuli designed to map the visual system. Using population receptive field (pRF) modelling, we revealed retinotopic-related responses in the auditory cortex of the deaf, but not in the hearing. These responses, that were mostly lateralized to the right hemisphere, represented the contralateral visual field, and were characterized by large receptive fields, centred to near foveal areas. Interestingly, we found that these responses to visual stimuli predominantly reflected negative BOLD signals in the auditory cortex of the deaf, suggesting that visual information might be represented through cross-modal deactivation signals.",

Here, using the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS, we performed an integrated single-nucleus RNA and ATAC-seq analysis of the cortex. We identify cell type-specific transcriptional and chromatin-associated changes in the Ts65Dn cortex, including regulators of neuroinflammation, transcription and translation, myelination, and mitochondrial function. We discover enrichment of a senescence-associated transcriptional signature in Ts65Dn oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and epigenetic changes consistent with a loss of heterochromatin. We find that senescence is restricted to a subset of cortical OPCs concentrated in deep cortical layers. Treatment of Ts65Dn mice with a senescence-reducing flavonoid rescues cortical OPC proliferation, restores microglial homeostasis, and improves contextual fear memory. Together, these findings suggest that cortical OPC senescence may be an important driver of neuropathology in DS.",

    "abstract": "In severe epileptic encephalopathies, epileptic activity contributes to progressive cognitive dysfunction. Several epileptic encephalopathies share the trait of spike-wave activation during non-rapid eye movement sleep (EE-SWAS), a state dominated by sleep oscillations known to coordinate offline memory consolidation. How epileptic activity impacts these thalamocortical sleep oscillations has not been directly observed in humans. Using a unique dataset of simultaneous human thalamic and cortical recordings in subjects with and without EE-SWAS, we reconcile prior conflicting observations about how epileptic spikes coordinate with sleep oscillations and provide direct evidence for epileptic spike interference of sleep spindle production. We find that slow oscillations facilitate both epileptic spikes and sleep spindles during stage 2 sleep (N2) at different phases of the slow oscillation. We show that sleep activated cortical epileptic spikes propagate to the thalamus (thalamic spike rate is increased after a cortical spike, p[~]0). Thalamic spikes increase the spindle refractory period (p<1.5e-21). In patients with EE-SWAS, the abundance of thalamic spikes result in downregulation of spindles for 30 seconds after each thalamic spike (p=3.4e-11) and decreased overall spindle rate across N2 (p=2e-7). These direct human thalamocortical observations identify a novel mechanism through which epileptiform spikes could impact cognitive function, wherein sleep-activated epileptic spikes inhibit thalamic sleep spindles in epileptic encephalopathy.",

    "abstract": "Separable striatal circuits have unique functions in Pavlovian and instrumental behaviors but how these roles relate to performance of sequences of actions with and without associated cues is less clear. Here we tested whether dopamine release and neural activity more generally in three striatal subdomains are necessary for performance of an action chain leading to reward delivery. Male and female Long-Evans rats were trained to press a series of three spatially-distinct levers to receive reward. We assessed the contribution of neural activity or dopamine release within each striatal subdomain when progression through the action sequence was explicitly cued and in the absence of cues. Behavior in both task variations was substantially impacted following microinfusion of the dopamine antagonist, flupenthixol, into nucleus accumbens core (NAc) or dorsomedial striatum (DMS), with impairments in sequence timing and a strong impact on motivation after NAc flupenthixol. In contrast, after pharmacological inactivation to suppress overall activity, there was minimal impact on motivation, except within the uncued task after DMS inactivation. Inactivation of both NAc and DMS impaired sequence timing and led to sequence errors in the uncued, but not cued task. There was virtually no impact of dopamine antagonism or reversible inactivation of dorsolateral striatum on either cued or uncued action sequence completion. These results highlight an essential contribution of NAc and DMS dopamine systems in motivational and performance aspects of chains of actions, whether cued or internally generated, as well as the impact of intact NAc and DMS function for correct sequence performance.",

    "abstract": "Hearing is an active process and recent studies show that even the ear is affected by cognitive states or motor actions. One example are movements of the eardrum induced by saccadic eye movements - known as \"eye movement-related eardrum oscillations\" (EMREOs). While these are systematically shaped by the direction and size of saccades, the consequences of saccadic eye movements and their resulting EMREOs for hearing remain unclear. We here studied their implications for the detection of near-threshold clicks in human participants. Across three experiments sound detection was not affected by their time of presentation relative to saccade onset, by saccade amplitude or direction. While the EMREOs were shaped by the direction and amplitude of the saccadic movement, inducing covert shifts in spatial attention did not affect the EMREO, suggesting that this signature of active sensing is restricted to overt changes in visual focus. Importantly, in our experiments fluctuations in the EMREO amplitude were not related to detection performance, at least when monaural cues are sufficient. Hence while eye movements may shape the transduction of acoustic information the behavioral implications remain unclear.",

    "abstract": "When the eyes view separate and incompatible images, the brain suppresses one image and promotes the other into visual awareness. Periods of interocular suppression can be prolonged during continuous flash suppression (CFS) - when one eye views a static  target while the other views a complex dynamic stimulus. Measuring the time needed for a suppressed image to break CFS (bCFS) has been widely used to investigate unconscious processing, and the results have generated controversy regarding the scope of visual processing without awareness. Here, we address this controversy with a new  CFS tracking paradigm (tCFS) in which the suppressed monocular target steadily increases in contrast until breaking into awareness (as in bCFS) after which it decreases until it again disappears (reCFS), with this cycle continuing for many reversals. Unlike bCFS, tCFS provides a measure of suppression depth by quantifying the difference between breakthrough and suppression thresholds. tCFS confirms that: (i) breakthrough thresholds indeed differ across target types (e.g., faces vs gratings, as bCFS has shown) - but (ii) suppression depth does not vary across target types. Once the breakthrough contrast is reached for a given stimulus, all stimuli require a strikingly uniform reduction in contrast to reach the corresponding suppression threshold. This uniform suppression depth points to a single mechanism of CFS suppression, one that likely occurs early in visual processing that is not modulated by target salience or complexity. More fundamentally, it shows that variations in breakthrough thresholds alone are insufficient for inferring unconscious or preferential processing of given image categories.\n\nSignificance statementResearch on unconscious vision has proliferated recently, often employing the continuous flash suppression (CFS) method in which flicker in one eye suppresses the other eyes image from awareness. That image is strengthened progressively until it breaks into visibility. Low breakthrough thresholds are claimed to indicate unconscious processing during suppression. We introduce a method that quantifies breakthrough and also suppression thresholds, thus providing a lower bound missing from previous CFS research. Comparing various image types, including those claimed to undergo unconscious processing, all images show equal suppression when both thresholds are measured. We thus find no evidence of differential unconscious processing and conclude reliance on breakthrough thresholds is misleading without considering suppression thresholds and leads to spurious claims about unconscious processing.",

    "abstract": "Modelling peri-implantation mammalian development using the self-organising properties of stem cells is a rapidly growing field that has advanced our understanding of cell fate decisions occurring in the early embryo. Matrigel, a basement membrane matrix, is a critical substrate used in various protocols for its efficacy in promoting stem cell growth and self-organization. However, its role in driving stem cell lineage commitment, and whether this effect is driven by biochemical or physical cues is not being clearly defined. Here, we grow embryoid bodies in suspension, Matrigel, and agarose, an inert polysaccharide, to attempt to decouple the physical and biochemical roles of Matrigel and better understand how it drives stem cell differentiation. We show that stem cell aggregates in Matrigel are hindered in their ability to elongate compared to those grown in agarose or in suspension indicating that prohibitive role in self-organisation. Aggregates in Matrigel are also driven to differentiate into endoderm with ectoderm differentiation inhibited. Furthermore, these effects are not due to the physical presence of Matrigel as the same effects are not witnessed in aggregates grown in agarose. Our results thus indicate that Matrigel has a significant and complex effect on the differentiation and morphology of embryoid bodies.",

Here, we find that SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers a change in the transcriptional start site of the zddhc20 gene, both in cells and in an in vivo infection model, resulting in a 67-amino-acid-long N-terminally extended protein with 37-times higher Spike acylating activity, leading to enhanced viral infectivity.

However, the ontogeny of individual specialization, as well as the underlying social learning, genetic, and environmental drivers remain poorly understood. Using a multigenerational dataset of female European brown bears (Ursus arctos) followed since birth, we discerned the relative contributions of social learning, genetic predisposition, environment forcings, and maternal effects to individual dietary specialization. Individual specialization varied from omnivorous to carnivorous diets spanning half a trophic position. The main determinants of this dietary specialization were maternal learning during rearing (11%), environmental similarity (12%), and maternal effects (11%), whereas the contribution of genetic heritability was negligible. Importantly, the offsprings trophic position closely resembled the trophic position of their mother during the first 3-4 years after separation from the mother, but this relationship ceased with increasing time since separation. Our study reveals that social learning and maternal effects are as important for individual dietary specialization as environmental forcings. We propose a tighter integration of social effects into future studies of range expansion and habitat selection under global change, that to date are mostly explained by environmental drivers.",

    "abstract": "Poultry industry in Nepal has experienced remarkable growth in the last decade, but farm biosafety and biosecurity measures are often overlooked by farmers due to lack of knowledge or to save cost. As a result, farms often suffer from sporadic and regular outbreaks of many zoonotic diseases such as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), impacting production and creating public health challenges. Poor farm management practices, including overuse of antibiotics for prophylaxis and therapeutics, can complicate the spread of poultry diseases by creating and enhancing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) that is threating to both, poultry, and human health.\n\nWe assessed biosafety, biosecurity risks and AMR stewardship in sixteen poultry farms located in four districts (Ramechhap, Nuwakot, Sindhupalchowk, and Kavre) surrounding densely populated Kathmandu valley. Risk assessment and AMR stewardship evaluation questionnaire were administered to formulate biosafety and biosecurity compliance matrix (BBCM). Risk assessment checklist assessed facility operations, personnel and standard operating procedures, water supply, cleaning and maintenance, rodent/pest control and farm record keeping. Oral and cloacal samples from the poultry were collected, pooled, and screened for eight poultry pathogens using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests.\n\nBased on BBCM, we identified one of the farms in Sindhupalchowk (Farm 4) having the most (BBCM score= 67%) and a farm in Kavre (Farm 3) to having the least (BBCM score= 12%) biosafety and biosecurity compliance. Although most of the farms (61.6%) followed general poultry farming practices, only half had clean and well-maintained farms. Personal safety standard procedure compliance (BBCM score = 42.4%) and rodent control (BBCM score = 3.1%) were the biggest gaps. At least one of either bacterial or viral pathogen was detected in all farms. Mycoplasma gallisepticum was the most common disease detected in all but one farm, followed by Mycoplasma synoviae. Although more than half of the farmers considered AMR a threat, over 26% of them used antibiotics as a preventive measure and 81% did not consider withdrawal period for antibiotics prior to processing of their meat products. Additionally, antibiotics classified as Watch and Restrict by the WHO were frequently used by the farmers to treat bacterial infections in their farms. Lack of awareness and inadequate enforcement of regulations have exacerbated the risk of disease transmission in farms and compromised antimicrobial stewardship.",

    "abstract": "The human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum requires exogenous fatty acids to support its growth during the pathogenic, asexual erythrocytic stage. Host serum lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) is a significant fatty acid source, yet the metabolic processes responsible for the liberation of free fatty acids from exogenous LPC are unknown. Using a novel assay for LPC hydrolysis in P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes, we have identified small-molecule inhibitors of key in situ lysophospholipase activities. Competitive activity-based profiling and generation of a panel of single-to-quadruple knockout parasite lines revealed that two enzymes of the serine hydrolase superfamily, termed exported lipase (XL) 2 and exported lipase homolog (XLH) 4, are the dominant lysophospholipase activities in parasite-infected erythrocytes. The parasite ensures efficient exogenous LPC hydrolysis by directing these two enzymes to distinct locations: XL2 is exported to the erythrocyte, while XLH4 is retained within the parasite. While XL2 and XLH4 were individually dispensable with little effect on LPC hydrolysis in situ, loss of both enzymes resulted in a strong reduction in fatty acid scavenging from LPC, hyperproduction of phosphatidylcholine, and an enhanced sensitivity to LPC toxicity. Notably, growth of XL/XLH- deficient parasites was severely impaired when cultured in media containing LPC as the sole exogenous fatty acid source. Furthermore, when XL2 and XLH4 activities were ablated by genetic or pharmacologic means, parasites were unable to proliferate in human serum, a physiologically-relevant fatty acid source, revealing the essentiality of LPC hydrolysis in the host environment and its potential as a target for anti-malarial therapy.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophages are proposed to drive bacterial population dynamics, yet direct evidence of their impact on natural populations is limited. Here we identified phages in a metapopulation of wild plant-associated Pseudomonas genomes, including historical herbarium specimens. We discovered a viral cluster shared amongst pathogenic Pseudomonas isolates, which encodes a tailocin - a phage-derived element utilized for interbacterial warfare. Each pathogenic Pseudomonas strain carries one of a few distinct tailocin variants, which selectively kill other co-occurring pathogenic strains. Herbarium-derived genomes revealed that the same tailocin variants have persisted in the Pseudomonas populations for at least two centuries, suggesting the continued use of a defined set of variants. These results indicate that tailocin genetic diversity can be mined to develop targeted \"tailocin cocktails\" for microbial control.",

    "abstract": "Low recycling rates have resulted in the alarming rate of accumulation of a widely used plastic material, polyethylene terephthalate (PET). With the build-up of plastics in our environment, there is an urgent need to source for more sustainable solutions to process them. Biological methods such as enzyme-catalyzed PET recycling or bioprocessing are seen as a potential solution to this problem. Actinobacteria, known for producing enzymes involved in the degradation of complex organic molecules, are of particular interest due to their potential to produce PET degrading enzymes. The highly thermostable enzyme, leaf-branch compost cutinase (LCC) found in Actinobacteria is one such example. This work expands on the discovery and characterization of new PET degrading enzymes from Microbispora, Nonomuraea, and Micromonospora genus. Within this genus, we analyzed enzymes from the polyesterase-lipase-cutinase family, which have [~]60% similarity to LCC, where one of the enzymes was found to be capable of breaking down PET and BHET at 45-50 {degrees}C. Moreover, we were able to enhance the enzymes depolymerization rate through further engineering, resulting in a two-fold increase in activity.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe proliferation of PET plastic waste poses a significant threat to human and environmental health, making it an issue of increasing concern. In response to this challenge, scientists are investigating eco-friendly approaches, such as bioprocessing and microbial factories, to sustainably manage the growing quantity of plastic waste in our ecosystem. Despite the existence of enzymes capable of degrading PET, their scarcity in nature limits their applicability. The objective of this study is to enhance our understanding of this group of enzymes by identifying and characterizing novel ones that can facilitate the breakdown of PET waste. This data will expand the enzymatic repertoire and provide valuable insights into the prerequisites for successful PET degradation.",

    "abstract": "The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway plays crucial roles in cell viability and protein synthesis and is frequently co-opted by viruses to support their replication. Although many viruses maintain high levels of AKT activity during infection, other viruses, such as vesicular stomatitis virus and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), cause AKT to accumulate in an inactive state. To efficiently replicate, HCMV requires FoxO transcription factors to localize to the infected cell nucleus (Zhang et. al. mBio 2022), a process directly antagonized by AKT. Therefore, we sought to investigate how HCMV inactivates AKT to achieve this. Subcellular fractionation and live cell imaging studies indicated that AKT failed to recruit to membranes upon serum-stimulation of infected cells. However, UV-inactivated virions were unable to render AKT non-responsive to serum, indicating a requirement for de novo viral gene expression. Interestingly, we were able to identify that UL38 (pUL38), a viral activator of mTORC1, is required to diminish AKT responsiveness to serum. mTORC1 contributes to insulin resistance by causing proteasomal degradation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins, such as IRS1, which are necessary for the recruitment of PI3K to growth factor receptors. In cells infected with a recombinant HCMV disrupted for UL38, AKT responsiveness to serum is retained and IRS1 is not degraded. Furthermore, ectopic expression of UL38 in uninfected cells induces IRS1 degradation, inactivating AKT. These effects of UL38 were reversed by the mTORC1 inhibitor, rapamycin. Collectively, our results demonstrate that HCMV relies upon a cell-intrinsic negative feedback loop to render AKT inactive during productive infection.",

    "abstract": "Metabolism provides the foundation for all cellular functions. During persistent infections, in adapted pathogenic bacteria it functions radically differently compared with more naive strains. However, whether this is simply a necessary accommodation to the persistence phenotype or if metabolism plays a direct role in achieving persistence in the host is still unclear. Here, we characterize a shift in metabolic functions aligned with a persistence phenotype occurring in eight infection scenarios of Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization of people with cystic fibrosis. We identify clinical mutations in the key metabolic enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase leading to a host specialized metabolism together with a lower virulence and immune response recruitment. This is mediated by impaired type III secretion system activity and by secretion of the antioxidant metabolite, pyruvate. These results provide evidence for the direct adaptiveness of metabolism during a persistent infection and its intrinsic role in supporting pathogenicity.",

    "abstract": "Ubiquitylation is a post-translational modification promoting protein degradation. Within the endomembrane system ubiquitylation marks proteins for lysosomal processing. Deubiquitinases (DUBs) cleave ubiquitin from modified proteins and, in the case of surface proteins, prevent lysosomal targeting and thus play a major role in controlling turnover. In Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease, acquisition of nutrients in parasites proliferating within the blood meal of insect vectors occurs via the cytostome, a unique structure connected to a long tubular cytopharynx. Contents are delivered to late endosomes and accumulate in reservosomes, equivalent to lysosomes. When starved, T. cruzi differentiates into mammalian infective trypomastigotes, which are cell cycle arrested. Here we asked what roles ubiquitylation plays in this unique endocytic process by interrogation of the T. cruzi ortholog of VDU (von Hippel-Lindau-interacting deubiquitylating enzyme)/USP33 (ubiquitin-specific protease). We found that TcVDU expression level inversely correlated with transferrin endocytosis, and that overexpression led to a longer retention of the endocytic cargo near the cytostome. TcVDU itself was found enriched in the anterior region of the parasite, in proximity to endocytic cargo. Most importantly, TcVDU overexpression reduced parasite invasion capacity and led to increased release of trans-sialidase. These alterations in the abundance of multiple surface proteins in TcVDU mutants indicate a key role of TcVDU in modulating the T. cruzi surface by affecting the endosomal traffic and consequently the host-parasite interface.\n\nAuthor summaryTrypanosoma cruzi is the cause of Chagas disease that affects large populations of Central and South America. Disease is spreading to other continents due to poor control of blood transfusion from donors with chronic and undiagnosed infection, migration and drug treatment with limited performance and undesired side effects. Proliferating forms of T. cruzi acquire nutrients through the cytostome, a cell surface opening connected to a long tubular cytopharynx. Internalized material is endocytosed in the cytopharynx. This is distinct from other members of the Trypanosomatids, which endocytose material exclusively through the flagellar pocket. By using CRISPR gene editing and overexpression we demonstrated that a conserved deubiquitinase (VDU) is a key control element for traffic from the cytopharynx to endosomal compartments in T. cruzi. Changed levels of VDU modify endosomal traffic and largely impact the parasite surface, causing changes in infectivity.",

    "abstract": "The composition of the microbiome is shaped by both environment and host genetic background in most organisms, but in the mosquito Aedes aegypti the role of host genetics in shaping the microbiome is poorly understood. Previously, we had shown that four lines of Ae. aegypti harbored different microbiomes when reared in the same insectary under identical conditions. To determine whether these lines differed from each other across time and in different environments, we characterized the microbiome of the same four lines of Ae. aegypti reared in the original insectary and at another institution. While it was clear that the environment influenced the microbiomes of these lines, we did still observe distinct differences in the microbiome between lines within each insectary. Clear differences were observed in alpha diversity, beta diversity, and abundance of specific bacterial taxa. To determine if the line specific differences in the microbiome were maintained across environments, pair-wise differential abundances of taxa was compared between insectaries. Lines were most similar to other lines from the same insectary than to the same line reared in a different insectary. Additionally, relatively few differentially abundant taxa identified between pairs of lines were shared across insectaries, indicating that line specific properties of the microbiome are not conserved across environments, or that there were distinct microbiota within each insectary. Overall, these results demonstrate that mosquito line can shape the microbiome across microbially- diverse environments and host by microbe interactions affecting microbiome composition and abundance is dependent on environmentally available bacteria.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe mosquito microbiome plays a critical role in shaping interactions with human pathogens. The factors that contribute to shaping the composition of the mosquito microbiome are of high importance due to its role in pathogen interactions and the successful development of control strategies. In other organisms, both host genetics and environment shape the microbiome composition, but the role of host genetics in shaping the mosquito microbiome is less clear. Previously, we have shown that different lines of Aedes aegypti harbor different microbiomes when reared in the same environment. We were curious to see if these differences could still be detected after further generations in the same insectary and across environments in a different insectary. We found that found that the microbiome differed between these lines in each insectary indicating an element of both host genetic background and environment play a role in establishing the microbiome. Our results indicate that different genetic backgrounds of Ae. aegypti will interact with their environment differently to shape their microbiome, which could potentially influence interactions with human pathogens and/or the effectiveness of control strategies. More broadly, our results are of interest for the ecology of host-microbe interactions.",

A recent study detected DNA polymerase genes that originated from large dsDNA viruses in the genomes of basal fungi, suggestive of the existence of dsDNA viruses capable of infecting fungi. In this study, we searched for viral infection signatures in chromosome-level genome assemblies of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Rhizophagus irregularis. We identified a continuous 1.5 Mb putative viral region on a chromosome in R. irregularis strain 4401. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the viral region is related to viruses in the family Asfarviridae of the phylum Nucleocytoviricota. Single-copy marker genes from Nucleocytoviricota were detected as single-copy genes in the viral region. Furthermore, this viral region was absent in the genomes of four other R. irregularis strains and had fewer signals of fungal transposable elements than the other genomic regions. These results suggest a recent and single insertion of a large dsDNA viral genome in the genome of this fungal strain, providing strong evidence of the recent infection of the fungus by a dsDNA virus.",

    "abstract": "Organohalide-respiring bacteria (OHRB) are keystone microbes in bioremediation of sites contaminated with organohalides and in natural halogen cycling. Known OHRB belong to distinct genera within the phyla Chloroflexota, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, whereas information about novel OHRB mediating natural halogen cycling remains scarce. In this study, we applied a genome-resolved transcriptomic approach to characterize the identity and activity of OHRB from PCE-respiring cultures previously enriched from sediments of Aarhus Bay. Combining short- and long-read sequencing approaches, we assembled 37 high quality bins with over 75 % completeness and less than 5 % contamination. Sixteen bins harbored RDase genes, and were affiliated taxonomically to the class of Bacilli, and phyla of Bacteroidota, Synergistota, and Spirochaetota, that have not been reported to catalyze reductive dehalogenation. Among the 16 bins, bin.26, phylogenetically closely related to the genus Vulcanibacillus, contained an unprecedented 97 RDase genes. Of these, 84 RDase genes of bin.26 were transcribed during PCE dechlorination in addition to RDase genes from members of Synergistales (bin.15 and bin.32) and Bacteroidales (bin.18 and bin.24). Moreover, metatranscriptome analysis suggested the RDase genes were likely under the regulation of transcriptional regulators not previously associated with OHR, such as HrcA and SigW, which are known to respond to abiotic environmental stresses, such as temperature changes. Combined application of genomic methods enabled us to pinpoint novel OHRB from pristine environments not previously known to mediate reductive dechlorination and to provide evidence towards the diversity, activity and regulation of reductive dehalogenases.",

Commensal bacteria can reestablish microbiota-mediated colonization resistance after completion of antibiotic therapy, but they cannot engraft during antibiotic prophylaxis. Here we use a mouse model to provide a proof of concept for an alternative approach, which replaces commensal bacteria functionally with drugs to restore colonization resistance against C. albicans. Streptomycin treatment, which depletes Clostridia from the gut microbiota, disrupted colonization resistance against C. albicans and increased epithelial oxygenation in the large intestine. Inoculating mice with a defined community of commensal Clostridia species reestablished colonization resistance and restored epithelial hypoxia. Notably, these functions of commensal Clostridia species could be replaced functionally with the drug 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), which activates mitochondrial oxygen consumption in the epithelium of the large intestine. When streptomycin-treated mice received 5-ASA, the drug reestablished colonization resistance against C. albicans and restored physiological hypoxia in the epithelium of the large intestine. We conclude that 5-ASA treatment is a non-biotic intervention that restores colonization resistance against C. albicans without requiring the administration of live bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing is catalyzed by nuclear ADAR1 p110 and ADAR2, and cytoplasmic ADAR1 p150 in mammals, all of which recognize double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) as targets. Although its frequency is quite rare, RNA editing occurs in coding regions, which alters protein functions by exchanging amino acid sequences, and is therefore physiologically significant. In general, such coding sites are edited by ADAR1 p110 and ADAR2 prior to splicing, given that the corresponding exon forms a dsRNA structure with an adjacent intron. We previously found that RNA editing at two coding sites of antizyme inhibitor 1 (AZIN1) is sustained in Adar1 p110/Aadr2 double knockout mice. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying RNA editing of AZIN1 remain unknown. Here, we showed that Azin1 editing levels were increased upon type I interferon treatment, which activated Adar1 p150 transcription, in mouse Raw264.7 cells. Azin1 RNA editing was observed in mature mRNA but not precursor mRNA. Furthermore, we revealed that the two coding sites were editable only by ADAR1 p150 in both mouse Raw264.7 and human HEK293T cells. This unique editing was achieved by forming a dsRNA structure with a downstream exon after splicing and the intervening intron suppressed RNA editing. Therefore, deletion of a nuclear export signal from ADAR1 p150, shifting its localization to the nucleus, decreased Azin1 editing levels. Finally, we demonstrated that Azin1 RNA editing was completely absent in Adar1 p150 knockout mice. Thus, these findings indicate that RNA editing of AZIN1 coding sites is exceptionally catalyzed by ADAR1 p150 after splicing.",

    "abstract": "Transcription of tRNA genes by RNA Polymerase III (RNAPIII) is tightly regulated by signaling cascades in response to nutrient availability. The emerging notion of differential tRNA gene regulation implies the existence of additional regulatory mechanisms. However, tRNA gene-specific regulatory factors have not been described. For that reason, we decoded the proteome of a single native tRNA gene locus in yeast. We observed dynamic reprogramming of the core RNAPIII transcription machinery upon nutrient perturbation. In addition, we identified Fpt1, a protein of unknown function. Fpt1 uniquely occupied tRNA genes but its occupancy varied and correlated with the efficiency of RNAPIII eviction upon nutrient perturbation. Decoding the proteome of a tRNA gene in the absence of Fpt1 revealed that Fpt1 promotes eviction of RNAPIII. Cells without Fpt1 also showed impaired shutdown of ribosome biogenesis genes upon nutrient perturbation. Our findings provide support for a chromatin-associated mechanism required for RNAPIII eviction from tRNA genes and for tuning an integrated physiological response to changing metabolic demands.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=118 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/534528v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (34K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b2ef53org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7e6234org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1614b5borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9a4933_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The duplex telomere repeat binding protein TRF2 stabilizes chromosome ends by suppressing DNA damage response and aberrant DNA repair. Herein we report our analysis of the Trf2 ortholog in Ustilago maydis (a basidiomycete fungus that bears strong resemblances to mammals with regard to telomere regulation), which underscores the suppression of Blm helicase as a key protective mechanism. Trf2 binds to Blm in vitro and inhibits Blm-mediated unwinding of telomeric DNA substrates. Notably, while the loss of Trf2 engenders growth arrest and a multiplicity of telomere aberrations, these defects are fully suppressed by concurrent deletion of blm and mre11 (but not other DNA repair factors). Over-expression of Trf2 induces telomere shortening through a pathway that is epistatic to blm{Delta} . Moreover, over-expression of Blm alone triggers aberrant telomere recombination as evidenced by the accumulation ECTRs and C-circles, and these aberrations can be ameliorated by concurrent over-expression of Trf2. Together, these observations reveal a new mechanism for telomere protection by Trf2, namely through the repression of Blm activity. Interestingly, U. maydis harbors a second double-strand telomere repeat-binding protein (Tay1), which promotes Blm function at telomeres to ensure efficient replication. Our results thus point to opposing regulation of Blm helicase by telomere proteins as a strategy for fine-tuning Blm function - such that this helicase is able to promote telomere maintenance without triggering telomere de-protection.",

    "abstract": "Host-parasite interactions exert strong selection pressures on the genomes of both host and parasite. These interactions can lead to increased fitness of rare alleles, resulting in negative frequency-dependent selection, a form of balancing selection that is hypothesised to explain the high levels of polymorphism seen in many host immune and parasite antigen loci. Despite their economic and ecological importance, there is limited evidence for balancing selection in parasitism-relevant genes in parasitic nematodes. Here, we sequenced the genomes of several individuals of Heligmosomoides bakeri, a parasite of house mice that is a well-established model parasitic nematode, and Heligmosomoides polygyrus, a closely related parasite of wood mice. We combined our single nematode genome assemblies with chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) libraries derived from pools of individuals to generate chromosome-level reference genomes for both species. Although H. bakeri is commonly referred to as H. polygyrus in the literature, their genomes show levels of divergence that are consistent with millions of years of independent evolution. We found that the H. bakeri genome, which we expected to be highly homozygous through inbreeding, contained hundreds of hyper-divergent haplotypes, similar to those recently reported in free-living nematodes. Within these haplotypes, we found an enrichment of protein families that interact with the host immune response, including protease inhibitors and transthyretin-related proteins. We also found that many of these haplotypes originated prior to the divergence between H. bakeri and H. polygyrus, suggesting that they have been maintained since the last common ancestor of the two species by long-term balancing selection. Together, our results suggest that selection pressures exerted on parasites by their hosts have led to unexpected modes and levels of genetic diversity in the genomes of these economically and ecologically important species.",

    "abstract": "Peptidoglycan (PGN), a net-like polymer constituted by muropeptides, provides protection for microorganisms and has been a major target for antibiotics for decades. Researchers have explored host-microbiome interactions through PGN recognition systems and discovered key muropeptides modulating host responses. However, most common characterization techniques for muropeptides are labor-intensive and require manual analysis of mass spectra due to the complex cross-linked PGN structures. Each species has unique moiety modifications and inter-/intra-bridges, which further complicates the structural analysis of PGN. Here, we developed a high-throughput automated muropeptide analysis (HAMA) platform leveraging tandem mass spectrometry and in silico muropeptide MS/MS fragmentation matching to comprehensively identify muropeptide structures, quantify their abundance, and infer PGN cross-linking types. We demonstrated the effectiveness of HAMA platform using well-characterized PGNs from E. coli and S. aureus and further applied it to common gut bacteria including Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, and Akkermansia muciiniphila. Specifically, we found that the stiffness and strength of the cell envelopes may correspond to the lengths and compositions of interpeptide bridges within Bifidobacterium species. In summary, the HAMA framework exhibits an automated, intuitive, and accurate analysis of PGN compositions, which may serve as a potential tool to investigate the post-synthetic modifications of saccharides, the variation in interpeptide bridges, and the types of cross-linking within bacterial PGNs.",

    "abstract": "The spirochete bacterial pathogen Borrelia (Borreliella) burgdorferi (Bbu) affects more than 10% of the world population and causes Lyme disease in about half a million people in the US annually. Therapy for Lyme disease includes antibiotics that target the Bbu ribosome. We determined the structure of the Bbu 70S ribosome by single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) at a resolution of 2.9 [A], revealing its distinctive features. In contrast to a previous study suggesting that the single hibernation promoting factor protein present in Bbu (bbHPF) may not bind to its ribosome, our structure reveals a clear density for bbHPF bound to the decoding center of the small ribosomal 30S subunit. The 30S subunit has a non-annotated ribosomal protein, bS22, that has been found only in mycobacteria and Bacteroidetes so far. The protein bL38, recently discovered in Bacteroidetes, is also present in the Bbu large 50S ribosomal subunit. The protein bL37, previously seen only in mycobacterial ribosomes, is replaced by an N-terminal -helical extension of uL30, suggesting that the two bacterial ribosomal proteins uL30 and bL37 may have evolved from one longer uL30 protein. The longer uL30 protein interacts with both the 23S rRNA and the 5S rRNA, is near the peptidyl transferase center (PTC), and could impart greater stability to this region. Its analogy to proteins uL30m and mL63 in mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes also suggests a plausible evolutionary pathway for expansion of protein content in mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes. Computational binding free energies are predicted for antibiotics, bound to the decoding center or PTC and are in clinical use for Lyme disease, that account for subtle distinctions in antibiotic-binding regions in the Bbu ribosome structure. Besides revealing unanticipated structural and compositional features for the Bbu ribosome, our study thus provides groundwork to enable ribosome-targeted antibiotic design for more effective treatment of Lyme disease.",

Unusually, histones from kinetoplastids are highly divergent. The structural and functional consequences of this variation are unknown. Here, we have biochemically and structurally characterised nucleosome core particles (NCPs) from the kinetoplastid parasite Trypanosoma brucei. A structure of the T. brucei NCP reveals that global histone architecture is conserved, but specific sequence alterations lead to distinct DNA and protein interaction interfaces. The T. brucei NCP is unstable and has weakened overall DNA binding. However, dramatic changes at the H2A-H2B interface introduce local reinforcement of DNA contacts. The T. brucei acidic patch has altered topology and is refractory to known binders, indicating that the nature of chromatin interactions in T. brucei may be unique.

    "abstract": "The RNA exosome is a ribonuclease complex that mediates both RNA processing and degradation. This complex is evolutionarily conserved, ubiquitously expressed, and required for fundamental cellular functions, including rRNA processing. The RNA exosome plays roles in regulating gene expression and protecting the genome, including modulating the accumulation of RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops). The function of the RNA exosome is facilitated by cofactors, such as the RNA helicase MTR4, which binds/remodels RNAs. Recently, missense mutations in RNA exosome subunit genes have been linked to neurological diseases. One possibility to explain why missense mutations in genes encoding RNA exosome subunits lead to neurological diseases is that the complex may interact with cell- or tissue-specific cofactors that are impacted by these changes. To begin addressing this question, we performed immunoprecipitation of the RNA exosome subunit, EXOSC3, in a neuronal cell line (N2A) followed by proteomic analyses to identify novel interactors. We identified the putative RNA helicase, DDX1, as an interactor. DDX1 plays roles in double-strand break repair, rRNA processing, and R-loop modulation. To explore the functional connections between EXOSC3 and DDX1, we examined the interaction following double-strand breaks, and analyzed changes in R-loops in N2A cells depleted for EXOSC3 or DDX1 by DNA/RNA immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (DRIP-Seq). We find that EXOSC3 interaction with DDX1 is decreased in the presence of DNA damage and that loss of EXOSC3 or DDX1 alters R-loops. These results suggest EXOSC3 and DDX1 interact during events of cellular homeostasis and potentially suppress unscrupulous expression of genes promoting neuronal projection.",

    "abstract": "Vascular compliance is considered both a cause and a consequence of cardiovascular disease and a significant factor in the mid- and long-term patency of vascular grafts. However, the biomechanical effects of localised changes in compliance, such as during plaque development or after bypass grafting and stenting, cannot be satisfactorily studied with the available medical imaging technologies or surgical simulation materials. To address this unmet need, we developed a coupled silico-vitro platform which allows for the validation of numerical fluid-structure interaction (FSI) results as a numerical model and physical prototype. This numerical one-way and two-way FSI study is based on a three-dimensional computer model of an idealised femoral artery which is validated against patient measurements derived from the literature. The numerical results are then compared with experimental values collected from compliant arterial phantoms. Phantoms within a compliance range of 1.4 - 68.0%/100mmHg were fabricated via additive manufacturing and silicone casting, then mechanically characterised via ring tensile testing and optical analysis under direct pressurisation with differences in measured compliance ranging between 10 - 20% for the two methods. One-way FSI coupling underestimated arterial wall compliance by up to 14.71% compared to two-way FSI modelling. Overall, Smooth-On Solaris matched the compliance range of the numerical and in vivo patient models most closely out of the tested silicone materials. Our approach is promising for vascular applications where mechanical compliance is especially important, such as the study of diseases which commonly affect arterial wall stiffness, such as atherosclerosis, and the model-based design, surgical training, and optimisation of vascular prostheses.",

Analysis of pooled CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function gene deletion screen datasets, identified PIK3CA and MTOR as targetable molecular dependencies across DIPG patient derived models, highlighting the therapeutic potential of the blood-brain barrier penetrant PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitor paxalisib. At the human equivalent maximum tolerated dose, mice treated with paxalisib experienced systemic feedback resulting in increased blood glucose and insulin levels, commensurate with DIPG patients in Phase 1b clinical trials who experienced hyperglycemia/hyperinsulinemia. To exploit genetic dependences, but maintain compliance and benefit, we optimized a paxalisib treatment regimen that employed reduced dosing more frequently, in combination with the anti-hyperglycemic drug, metformin. Combining optimized dosing with metformin restored glucose homeostasis and decreased phosphorylation of the insulin receptor in vivo, a common mechanism of PI3K-inhibitor resistance, extending the survival of DIPG xenograft models. RNA sequencing and phosphoproteomic profiling of DIPG models treated with paxalisib identified increased calcium-activated PKC signaling. Using the brain penetrant PKC inhibitor, enzastaurin in combination with paxalisib, we synergistically extended the survival of orthotopic xenograft models, benefits further promoted by metformin; thus, identifying a clinically relevant DIPG combinatorial approach.\n\nBrief SummaryDiffuse intrinsic pontine glioma is a lethal childhood brain tumor.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa PlpD is the prototype of an Omp85 protein family that contains an N-terminal patatin-like (PL) domain that is thought to be translocated across the OM by a C-terminal {beta}-barrel domain. Challenging the current dogma, we found that the PlpD PL-domain resides exclusively in the periplasm and, unlike previously studied Omp85 proteins, PlpD forms a homodimer. Remarkably, the PL-domain contains a segment that exhibits unprecedented dynamicity by undergoing transient strand-swapping with the neighboring {beta}-barrel domain.

    "abstract": "Modern diets typically contain dramatically lower fiber content compared to traditional hunter-gatherer and agrarian diets, and this trend is paralleled by an enhanced frequency of chronic diseases. Despite national nutrition policy and education instructing Americans on the beneficial health value of increasing daily fiber consumption, a \"fiber gap\" still persistently exists. Fortification of product groups frequently consumed by a large proportion of society provides an attractive strategy to close this \"fiber gap\" and may have the potential to concomitantly reverse the detrimental health effects exacerbated by our modern diets.Besides prebiotic fibers, products can contain several other functional components, such as botanicals. However, the vast majority of studies have investigated functional components in isolation. For instance, preferential fermentation of specific prebiotic fibers by bifidobacteria has been clearly established, both in terms of their increased abundance in the gut microbiome and the elevated levels of beneficial metabolites, including short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced directly (acetate) or through interactions with other microbiota members (resulting in butyrate and propionate production). The impact of other components present in functional product blends on this bifidogenic effect are largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the fiber and botanical blends included in OLIPOP, a functional soda, in an in vitro gut fermentation model. Our data revealed that the blend of inulins and resistant dextrins promoted growth of bifidobacteria across gut microbiota from four donors, even those with small initial populations. In addition, botanicals interacted with fiber fermentation in donor-specific ways, in some cases strongly enhancing fermentation rate and production of SCFAs. Our data suggest that botanicals can modify the rate and microbial and metabolic fates of prebiotic fiber fermentation, and suggest that future studies should examine such interactions in greater detail.",

    "abstract": "In a recent work we studied an artificial bacterial community where resistant bacteria assisted sensitive bacteria in surviving in the presence of antagonistic bacteria. Typically, this behavior is attributed to lateral gene exchange. However, we identified evidence of a distinct mechanism, which operates on the principle of \"the enemy of my enemy is my friend\". Here, we explore the viability of this mechanism by means of a reaction-diffusion mathematical model. Our findings suggest that this mechanism is feasible under specific circumstances, particularly when bacteria undergo significant metabolic changes at high population densities.\n\nAuthor summaryThe importance of studying the formation of bacterial communities cannot be overstated. Initially, it was believed that the environment alone determined the assembly of these communities, but recent research has demonstrated that interactions among members of the community also have a crucial impact. For instance, it has been observed in some cases that, even when susceptible bacteria are confronted with antagonism, they can survive with the aid of resistant bacteria. Lateral gene exchange is typically considered the underlying mechanism responsible for this phenomenon. However, we identified in a recent work an alternative mechanism that does not involve gene exchange but operates on the principle of \"the enemy of my enemy is my friend\". Using a mathematical model, we examine the plausibility of this mechanism in a small artificial bacterial community. Our results indicate that this mechanism alone cannot account for all the experimental observations, but including the assumption that bacteria undergo significant metabolic changes at high concentrations may suffice.",

To do this temsavir relies on the presence of a residue with small side chain at position 375 in Env and is unable to neutralize viral strains like CRF01_AE carrying His375. Here we investigate the mechanism of temsavir-resistance and show that residue 375 is not the sole determinant of resistance. At least six additional residues within the gp120 inner domain layers, including five distant from the drug-binding pocket, contribute to resistance. A detailed structure-function analysis using engineered viruses and soluble trimer variants reveal that the molecular basis of resistance is mediated by crosstalk between His375 and the inner domain layers. Furthermore, our data confirm that temsavir can adjust its binding mode to accommodate changes in Env conformation, a property that likely contributes to its broad-antiviral activity.",

    "abstract": "The clinical development of Natural Killer (NK) cell-mediated immunotherapy marks a milestone in the development of new cancer therapies and has gained traction due to the intrinsic ability of the NK cell to target and kill tumour cells. To fully harness the tumour killing ability of NK cells, we need to improve NK cell persistence and overcome suppression of NK cell activation in the tumour microenvironment. The trans-membrane, protein tyrosine phosphatase CD45, regulates NK cell homeostasis, with genetic loss of CD45 in mice resulting in increased numbers of mature NK cells [1-3]. This suggests that CD45-deficient NK cells might display enhanced persistence following adoptive transfer. However, here we demonstrated that adoptive transfer of CD45-deficiency did not enhance NK cell persistence in mice, and instead, the homeostatic disturbance of NK cells in CD45-deficient mice stemmed from a developmental defect in the common lymphoid progenitor population. The enhanced maturation within the CD45-deficient NK cell compartment was intrinsic to the NK cell lineage, and independent of the developmental defect. CD45 is not a conventional immune checkpoint candidate, as systemic loss is detrimental to T and B cell development [4-6], compromising the adaptive immune system. Nonetheless, this study suggests that inhibition of CD45 in progenitor or stem cell populations may improve the yield of in vitro generated NK cells for adoptive therapy.",

    "abstract": "Cultured meat is a promising technology that faces substantial cost barriers which are currently driven largely by the price of media components. Growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) drive the cost of serum-free media for relevant cells including muscle satellite cells. Here, we engineered immortalized bovine satellite cells (iBSCs) for inducible expression of FGF2 and/or mutated RasG12V in order to overcome media growth factor requirements through autocrine signaling. Engineered cells were able to proliferate over multiple passages in FGF2-free medium, thereby eliminating the need for this costly component. Additionally, cells maintained their myogenicity, albeit with reduced differentiation capacity. Ultimately, this offers a proof-of-principle for lower-cost cultured meat production through cell line engineering.",

    "abstract": "Cellular processes are regulated by the formation of specific membrane domains with different lipid and protein compositions. Small GTPases play a role in symmetry breaking and compartmentalization, with early endosomes presenting Rab5-enriched domains that regulate vesicle tethering and fusion. Rabaptin5, which binds activated Rab5 and forms dimers, is essential for endosome fusion and promotes Rab5 recruitment to membranes. Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is a mechanism for the biogenesis and maintenance of membrane-less organelles and intracellular organization. We show that several partners of Rab proteins, such as Rabaptin5, have phase-separation properties. In particular, Rabaptin5 form condensates close to membranes, while promoting the enrichment of several Rabs involved in early steps of endocytosis. We propose that phase separation of Rab partners ensures efficient recruitment of their respective Rabs and domain formation and maintenance.",

    "abstract": "Oligodendrocytes are generated via a two-step mechanism from pluripotent neural stem cells (NSCs): after differentiation of NSCs to oligodendrocyte precursor/NG2 cells (OPCs), they further develop into mature oligodendrocytes. The first step of this differentiation process is only incompletely understood. In this study, we utilized the neurosphere assay to investigate NSC to OPC differentiation in a time course-dependent manner by mass spectrometry-based (phospho-) proteomics. We identify double cortin like kinase 1 (Dclk1) as one of the most prominently regulated proteins in both datasets, and show that it undergoes a gradual transition between its short/long isoform during NSC to OPC differentiation. This is regulated by phosphorylation of its SP-rich region, resulting in inhibition of proteolytic Dclk1 long cleavage, and therefore Dclk1 short generation. Through interactome analyses of different Dclk1 isoforms by proximity biotinylation, we characterize their individual putative interaction partners and substrates.",

    "abstract": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is marked with the replacement of normal alveolar tissue by thicker and harder fibrous material, damaged exchange ability. Currently, nintedanib and pirfenidone, are the only FDA-approved drugs with limited efficacy for IPF, which indicated an urgent need to explore new therapies. Disulfiram (DSF), an acetaldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor, used as anti-alcohol treatment. Despite reported with anti-hepatic fibrosis effect of DSF, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In our study, DSF exhibited regulative impact on abnormal proliferation, EMT and ECM production in cell models of IPF including primary DHLF-IPF cells and TGF-{beta}1-stimulated A549 cells. The absence of COX-2 was restored by DSF treatment, together with elevated prostaglandin biosynthesis both in vitro and in vivo models of IPF. Furthermore, the anti-fibrotic effect of DSF was impeded with COX-2 knockdown or pharmacological inhibition in TGF-{beta}1-stimulated A549 cells, however, exogenous PGE2 reclaimed with anti-EMT function. In established animal model of IPF, DSF ameliorated declined lung function and histopathological changes, and restrained the lung hydroxyproline content. Together, these findings suggest that the anti-fibrotic effect of DSF was achieved through re-activation of COX-2 mediated PGE2 biosynthesis. The above results suggest that DSF can be applied therapeutically in fibrotic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Cell motility requires strict spatiotemporal control of protein expression. During cell migration, mRNA localization and local translation in subcellular areas like the leading edge and protrusions are particularly advantageous for regulating the reorganization of the cytoskeleton. Fidgetin-Like 2 (FL2), a microtubule severing enzyme (MSE) that restricts migration and outgrowth, localizes to the leading edge of protrusions where it severs dynamic microtubules. FL2 is primarily expressed during development but in adulthood, is spatially upregulated at the leading edge minutes after injury. Here, we show mRNA localization and local translation in protrusions of polarized cells are responsible for FL2 leading edge expression after injury. The data suggests that the RNA binding protein IMP1 is involved in the translational regulation and stabilization of FL2 mRNA, in competition with the miRNA let-7. These data exemplify the role of local translation in microtubule network reorganization during migration and elucidate an unexplored MSE protein localization mechanism.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=83 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/537087v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@139f4e5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fd1a4eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ca17b4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@da2b56_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIThe microtubule severing enzyme FL2 RNA is localized to the leading edge\nC_LIO_LIFL2 mRNA localization leads to FL2 translation within protrusions\nC_LIO_LIThe IMP family works in concert with Let-7 miRNA to regulate FL2 mRNA\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic beta cells are among the slowest replicating cells in the human body. Human beta cells usually do not increase in number with exceptions being during the neonatal period, in cases of obesity, and during pregnancy. This project explored maternal serum for stimulatory potential on human beta cell proliferation and insulin output. Gravid, full-term women who were scheduled to undergo cesarean delivery were recruited for this study. A human beta cell line was cultured in media supplemented with serum from pregnant and non-pregnant donors and assessed for differences in proliferation and insulin secretion. A subset of pregnant donor sera induced significant increases in beta cell proliferation and insulin secretion. Pooled serum from pregnant donors also increased proliferation in primary human beta cells but not primary human hepatocytes indicating a cell-type specific effect. This study suggests stimulatory factors in human serum during pregnancy could provide a novel approach for human beta cell expansion.",

    "abstract": "Microtubules regulate cell polarity and migration by local activation of focal adhesion turnover, but the mechanism of this process is insufficiently understood. Molecular complexes containing KANK family proteins connect microtubules with the major component of focal adhesions, talin. Local optogenetic activation of KANK1-mediated links which promoted microtubule targeting to individual focal adhesion resulting in its centripetal sliding and rapid disassembly. The sliding is preceded by a local increase of traction force due to accumulation of myosin-II and actin in the proximity of the focal adhesion. Knockdown of Rho activator GEF-H1 prevented development of traction force and abolished sliding and disassembly of focal adhesion upon KANK activation. Other players participating in microtubule-driven KANK-dependent focal adhesion disassembly include kinases ROCK and PAK, as well as microtubules/focal adhesions associated proteins Kinesin-1, APC and TAT. Finally, we propose a physical model of a microtubule-driven focal adhesion disruption involving local GEF-H1/RhoA/ROCK dependent activation of contractility which is consistent with experimental data.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are essential eukaryotic double-membrane organelles. The convoluted mitochondrial inner membrane forms highly organized invaginations, termed cristae, which are crucial for energy metabolism. Cristae formation requires MICOS, a conserved hetero-oligomeric inner membrane complex. The MICOS core subunit MIC10 is a small transmembrane protein that oligomerizes through highly conserved glycine-rich motifs to control cristae formation. Sequence alignments show that D. melanogaster exhibits three MIC10-like proteins with different tissue-specific expression patterns. Here, we show that the ubiquitously expressed Dmel_CG41128/MINOS1b/DmMIC10b is the major MIC10 orthologue in flies. Loss of DmMIC10b disturbs cristae architecture of mitochondria and reduces the life-span and fertility of flies. Moreover, using fluorescence nanoscopy and electron tomography, we demonstrate that despite its high similarity to the MIC10 proteins from yeast and humans, DmMIC10b exhibits the unique ability to polymerize into elongated filaments upon overexpression. DmMIC10b filaments form bundles which accumulate in the intermembrane space and alter the shape of mitochondrial cristae membranes. We show that the formation of the filaments relies on conserved glycine and cysteine residues and is suppressed by co-expression of other MICOS proteins. Thereby, our findings provide new insights into the regulation of MICOS in flies.",
