    "abstract": "Ocean warming, disease, and pollution contributed to global declines in coral abundances and diversity. In the Caribbean, corals previously dominated reefs, providing an architectural framework for diverse ecological habitats, but have significantly declined due to infectious microbial disease. Key species like coral Acropora cervicornis, are now considered critically endangered, prompting researchers to focus on scientific endeavors to identify factors that influence coral disease resistance and resilience. We previously showed that disease susceptibility, growth rates, and bleaching risk were all associated with the abundance of a single bacterial parasite,  Ca. Aquarickettsia rohweri which proliferates in vivo under nutrient enrichment. Yet how nutrients influence parasite physiology and life history strategies within its host are unknown. We performed microscopy and transcriptomic analyses of  Ca. A. rohweri populations during a 6-week nutrient exposure experiment. Microscopy showed that this parasite was abundant in coral tissue and densely packed in mucocytes prior to nutrient enrichment.  Ca. A. rohweri energy scavenging genes and those potentially involved in this habitat transition are significantly upregulated during enrichment. Specifically, transcripts involved in signaling, virulence, two-component systems, and nutrient import genes are elevated under higher nutrients. These data support the predicted role of  Ca. A. rohweri as a highly active nutrient-responsive A. cervicornis parasite, and provide a glimpse at the mechanism of induced disease susceptibility while implicating nutrient exposure in its horizontal transmission.\n\nSignificanceThe coral disease crisis has contributed to global declines in coral abundance and diversity and is exacerbated by environmental stressors like eutrophication. Thus, identifying factors that influence coral disease resistance and resilience is a top priority. The Rickettsiales-like bacterium,  Candidatus Aquarickettsia rohweri is ubiquitous coral symbiont that is strongly linked to coral disease susceptibility in staghorn coral, and is undergoing positive selection across the Caribbean. Although  Ca. A. rohweri is a putative parasite, little is known about the activity of this bacterium in coral tissue. This work supports the role of  Ca. A. rohweri as a highly active, nutrient-responsive parasite and proposes a mechanism for how  Ca. A. rohweri contributes to coral disease susceptibility, parasite expansion, and horizontal transmission.",

    "abstract": "Exocrine cells utilize large secretory vesicles (LSVs) up to 10 m in diameter. LSVs fuse with the apical surface, often recruiting actomyosin to extrude their content through dynamic fusion pores. The molecular mechanism regulating pore dynamics remains largely uncharacterized. We observe that the fusion pore of LSVs in the Drosophila larval salivary glands expand, stabilize, and constrict. Arp2/3 is essential for pore expansion and stabilization, while myosin II is essential for pore constriction. We identify several Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs (BAR) homology domain proteins that regulate fusion pore expansion and stabilization. We show that the I-BAR protein Missing-in-Metastasis (MIM) localizes to the fusion site and is essential for pore expansion and stabilization. The MIM I-BAR domain is essential but not sufficient for localization and function. We conclude that MIM acts in concert with actin, myosin II, and additional BAR-domain proteins to control fusion pore dynamics, mediating a distinct mode of exocytosis that facilitates actomyosin-dependent content release that maintains apical membrane homeostasis during secretion.",

    "abstract": "Modulations in chromatin structure orchestrate gene expression and direct stem cell fate. More specifically, the Histone 3 Lysine 9 Methyltransferase SETDB1 controls transcriptional repression to regulate pluripotency and self-renewal. While SETDB1 functions have been extensively studied in embryonic stem cells and in cancer cells, less is known on the role of SETDB1 in adult stem cells in vivo. Here, we show that SETDB1 expression by adult muscle stem cells (MuSCs) is absolutely required for muscle tissue regeneration following acute injury. We find that SETDB1 represses the expression of the endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) family of transposable elements in MuSCs. ERV re-expression in Setdb1-null MuSCs prevents their amplification following exit from quiescence and promotes cell death. Multi-omics profiling further shows that the absence of SETDB1 in MuSCs leads to the activation of the DNA-sensing cGAS-STING pathway, entailing activation of the Interferon pathway and increased cytokine expression. In vivo, the cytokine storm triggered by MuSCs devoid of Setdb1 provokes aberrant infiltration of inflammatory cells including the appearance of a pathological macrophage lineage. The ensuing histiocytosis results in necrosis of the newly formed muscle fibers and completely abolishes skeletal muscle tissue repair. In contrast, disruption of Setdb1 gene in another muscle-resident cell type, the fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs), does not lead to any phenotype. In conclusion, the control of genome stability by SETDB1 in an adult somatic stem cell is necessary for both its regenerative potential and its adequate communication with the inflammatory cells regulating tissue repair.",

    "abstract": "The delicate balance of protein homeostasis can be disturbed by mutations that affect folding and stability of the encoded protein. More than half of disease-causing missense variants are thought to lead to protein degradation, but determining which and the molecular mechanisms involved remain enigmatic. To examine these issues, we selected the ubiquitin-protein ligase Parkin, where known missense variants result in an autosomal recessive, early onset Parkinsonism. We used the variant abundance by massively parallel sequencing (VAMP-seq) approach to quantify the abundance of Parkin missense variants in cultured human cells. The resulting mutational map, covering 9219 out of the 9300 possible single-site amino acid substitutions and nonsense Parkin variants, show that most low abundance variants are located within the structured domains of the protein, while the flexible linker regions are more tolerant. The vast majority of low abundance Parkin variants are degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome system and are stabilized at a lowered temperature. The cellular abundance data correlate with thermodynamic stability, evolutionary conservation, and show that half of the known disease-linked variants are found at low abundance. Systematic mapping of degradation signals (degrons) shows that inherent primary degrons in Parkin largely overlap with regions that are buried, and highly sensitive to mutations. An exposed degron region proximal to the so-called \"activation element\" is enhanced by substitutions to hydrophobic residues and destroyed by introduction of hydrophilic residues. The data provide examples of how missense variants may cause degradation either via destabilization of the native protein, or by introducing local signals for degradation. Combined with the computational methods based on Parkin structure and conservation, our abundance map sheds light on the mechanisms that cause loss of function, and points to variants where function potentially can be restored.",

    "abstract": "DNA-protein interactions are pervasive in a number of biophysical processes ranging from transcription, gene expression, to chromosome folding. To describe the structural and dynamic properties underlying these processes accurately, it is important to create transferable computational models. Toward this end, we introduce Coarse grained force field for energy estimation, COFFEE, a robust framework for simulating DNA-protein complexes. To brew COFFEE, we integrated the energy function in the Self-Organized Polymer model with Side Chains for proteins and the Three Interaction Site model for DNA in a modular fashion, without re-calibrating any of the parameters in the original force-fields. A unique feature of COFFEE is that it describes sequence-specific DNA-protein interactions using a statistical potential (SP) derived from a dataset of high-resolution crystal structures. The only parameter in COFFEE is the strength ({lambda}DNAPRO) of the DNA-protein contact potential. For an optimal choice of{lambda} DNAPRO, the crystallographic B-factors for DNA-protein complexes, with varying sizes and topologies, are quantitatively reproduced. Without any further readjustments to the force-field parameters, COFFEE predicts the scattering profiles that are in quantitative agreement with SAXS experiments as well as chemical shifts that are consistent with NMR. We also show that COFFEE accurately describes the salt-induced unraveling of nucleosomes. Strikingly, our nucleosome simulations explain the destabilization effect of ARG to LYS mutations, which does not alter the balance of electrostatic interactions, but affects chemical interactions in subtle ways. The range of applications attests to the transferability of COFFEE, and we anticipate that it would be a promising framework for simulating DNA-protein complexes at the molecular length-scale.\n\nGraphical TOC Entry\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=81 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/544064v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (22K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1190c18org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@169098eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f24e75org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fd0bd1_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Vesicular trafficking facilitates material transport between membrane-bound organelles. Membrane protein cargos are trafficked for relocation, recycling, and degradation during various physiological processes. In vitro fusion studies utilized synthetic lipid membranes to study the molecular mechanisms of vesicular trafficking and to develop synthetic materials mimicking the biological membrane trafficking. Various fusogenic conditions which can induce vesicular fusion have been used to establish synthetic systems that can mimic biological systems. Despite these efforts, the mechanisms underlying vesicular trafficking of membrane proteins remain limited and robust in vitro methods that can construct synthetic trafficking systems for membrane proteins between large membranes (>1 m2) are unavailable. Here, we provide data to show the spontaneous transfer of small membrane-bound peptides ([~]4 kD) between a supported lipid bilayer (SLB) and giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). We found that the contact between the SLB and GUVs led to the occasional but notable transfer of membrane-bound peptides in a physiological saline buffer condition (pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl). Quantitative and dynamic time-lapse analyses suggested that the observed exchange occurred through the formation of hemi-fusion stalks between the SLB and GUVs. Larger protein cargos with a size of [~]77 kD could not be transferred between the SLB and GUVs, suggesting that the larger-sized cargos limited diffusion across the hemi-fusion stalk, which was predicted to have a highly curved structure. Our system serves as an example synthetic platform that enables the investigation of small-peptide trafficking between synthetic membranes and reveals hemi-fused lipid bridge formation as a mechanism of peptide transfer.\n\nGraphical abstracts\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=56 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/544237v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (21K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f72d8corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cf7ed5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8fee0forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1565484_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

However, the functional consequences and histopathological manifestation of concomitant p53 and Pten loss of function alterations in the development of endometrial cancer is still controversial. Here, we demonstrate that simultaneous Pten and p53 deletion is sufficient to cause epithelial to mesenchymal transition phenotype in endometrial organoids. By a novel TAT-fused Cre intravaginal delivery method, we achieved local ablation of both p53 and Pten specifically in the uterus. These mice developed high-grade endometrial carcinomas and a high percentage of uterine carcinosarcomas resembling those found in humans. To further demonstrate that carcinosarcomas arise from epithelium, double Pten/p53 deficient epithelial cells were mixed with wild type stromal and myometrial cells and subcutaneously transplanted to Scid mice. All xenotransplants resulted in the development of uterine carcinosarcomas displaying high nuclear pleomorphism and metastatic potential. Accordingly, in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 disruption of Pten and p53 also triggered the development of metastatic carcinosarcomas. Our results unfadingly demonstrate that simultaneous deletion of p53 and Pten in endometrial epithelial cells is enough to trigger epithelial to mesenchymal transition that is consistently translated to the formation of uterine carcinosarcomas in vivo.",

In this study, we investigated the trophic ecology and potential trophic niche partitioning of eleven mormyrid fish species from the Sanaga River system (Cameroon) using the stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen of muscles and of trophic prey samples. Albeit mormyrids mainly feed on invertebrates, we found differences in isotope signals and the trophic niche partitioning in the studied species. We further show that species with elongated snout tend to show higher carbon and nitrogen isotope signals, suggesting a potential role of snout shape in their trophic preferences. Furthermore, we found significant differences in isotopic signatures within the Mormyrus genus, highlighting ecological niche diversification among three closely related species. We also report on different isotopic signals between seasons of the year in four species, possibly caused by species migration and/or anthropogenic agricultural activities. Overall, our research presents robust evidence of the trophic niche partitioning within the entire mormyrid species community, shedding light on the enigmatic evolutionary history of these fascinating African fishes.",

    "abstract": "Foam cells are dysfunctional, lipid-laden macrophages associated with chronic inflammation of infectious and non-infectious origin. For decades, the paradigm underlying foam cell biology has been based on atherogenesis, a disease in which macrophages are cholesterol-enriched. Our previous work showed that foam cells in tuberculous lung lesions surprisingly accumulate triglycerides, suggesting multiple modalities of foam cell biogenesis. In the present study, we used matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging to assess the spatial distribution of storage lipids relative to foam-cell-rich areas in murine lungs infected with the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans and in human papillary renal cell carcinoma resection tissues. We also analyzed neutral lipid content and the transcriptional program of lipid-laden macrophages generated under corresponding in vitro conditions. The in vivo data were consistent with in vitro findings showing that C. neoformans-infected macrophages accumulated triglycerides, while macrophages exposed to human renal cell carcinoma-conditioned medium accumulated both triglycerides and cholesterol. Moreover, macrophage transcriptome analyses provided evidence for condition-specific metabolic remodeling. The in vitro data also showed that although both Mycobacterium tuberculosis and C. neoformans infections induced triglyceride accumulation in macrophages, they did so by different molecular mechanisms, as evidenced by different sensitivity of lipid accumulation to the drug rapamycin and the characteristics of macrophage transcriptome remodeling. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the mechanisms of foam cell formation are specific to the disease microenvironment. Since foam cells have been regarded as targets of pharmacological intervention in several diseases, recognizing that their formation is disease-specific opens new research directions of biomedical significance.\n\nSignificance statementChronic inflammatory states of infectious and non-infectious etiology are associated with dysfunctional immune responses. Primary contributors are foam cells, lipid-laden macrophages exhibiting impaired or pathogenic immune functions. In contrast with the long-standing paradigm derived from atherosclerosis, a disease in which foam cells are cholesterol-laden, our work demonstrates that foam cells are heterogeneous. Utilizing bacterial, fungal, and cancer models, we show that foam cells may accumulate various storage lipids (triglycerides and/or cholesteryl esters) by mechanisms that depend on disease-specific microenvironments. Thus, we present a new framework for foam cell biogenesis in which the atherosclerosis paradigm represents only a specific case. Since foam cells are potential therapeutic targets, understanding their mechanisms of biogenesis will provide knowledge needed for novel therapeutic approaches.",

    "abstract": "2.Viruses emerging from wildlife can cause outbreaks in humans and domesticated animals. Predicting the emergence of future pathogens and mitigating their impacts requires an understanding of what shapes virus diversity and dynamics in wildlife reservoirs. In order to better understand coronavirus ecology in wild species, we sampled birds within a coastal freshwater lagoon habitat across five years, focussing on a large population of mute swans (Cygnus olor) and the diverse species that they interact with. We discovered and characterised the full genome of a divergent gammacoronavirus belonging to the Goose coronavirus CB17 species. We investigated the genetic diversity and dynamics of this gammacoronavirus using untargeted metagenomic sequencing of 223 fecal samples from swans of known age and sex, and RT-PCR screening of 1632 additional bird samples. The virus circulated persistently within the bird community; virus prevalence in mute swans exhibited seasonal variations, but did not change with swan age-class or epidemiological year. One whole genome was fully characterised, and revealed that the virus originated from a recombination event involving an undescribed gammacoronavirus species. Multiple lineages of this gammacoronavirus co-circulated within our study population. Viruses from this species have recently been detected in aquatic birds from both the Anatidae and Rallidae families, implying that host species habitat sharing may be important in shaping virus host range. As the host range of the Goose coronavirus CB17 species is not limited to geese, we propose that this species name should be updated to \"Waterbird gammacoronavirus 1\". Non-invasive sampling of bird coronaviruses may provide a tractable model system for understanding the evolutionary and cross-species dynamics of coronaviruses.",

    "abstract": "Recombination is an ongoing and increasingly important feature of circulating lineages of SARS-CoV-2, challenging how we represent the evolutionary history of this virus and giving rise to new variants of potential public health concern by combining transmission and immune evasion properties of different lineages. Detection of new recombinant strains is challenging, with most methods looking for breaks between sets of mutations that characterise distinct lineages. In addition, many basic approaches fundamental to the study of viral evolution assume that recombination is negligible, in that a single phylogenetic tree can represent the genetic ancestry of the circulating strains. Here we present an initial version of sc2ts, a method to automatically detect recombinants in real time and to cohesively integrate them into a genealogy in the form of an ancestral recombination graph (ARG), which jointly records mutation, recombination and genetic inheritance. We infer two ARGs under different sampling strategies, and study their properties. One contains 1.27 million sequences sampled up to June 30, 2021, and the second is more sparsely sampled, consisting of 657K sequences sampled up to June 30, 2022. We find that both ARGs are highly consistent with known features of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, recovering the basic backbone phylogeny, mutational spectra, and recapitulating details on the majority of known recombinant lineages. Using the well-established and feature-rich tskit library, the ARGs can also be stored concisely and processed efficiently using standard Python tools. For example, the ARG for 1.27 million sequences--encoding the inferred reticulate ancestry, genetic variation, and extensive metadata--requires 58MB of storage, and loads in less than a second. The ability to fully integrate the effects of recombination into downstream analyses, to quickly and automatically detect new recombinants, and to utilise an efficient and convenient platform for computation based on well-engineered technologies makes sc2ts a promising approach.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic flagella collectively form metachronal waves and exhibit the ability to swim or cause flow. Large volvocine genera such as Eudorina, Pleodorina, and Volvox form bundles of small male gametes (sperm) called \"sperm packets\" for sexual reproduction. Although sperm packets have been reported to have flagella and the ability to swim, there has been no quantitative analysis of the motility of sperm packets. Moreover, describing motility of sperm packets is important in the context of collective motion and low Reynolds-number biofluid dynamics. In this study, we quantitatively described the swimming behavior of the sperm packets of a male strain of Pleodorina starrii. Although smaller, sperm packets swam faster than the asexual colonies of the same male strain. Sperm packets swam approximately 1.4 times faster than asexual colonies. Body length was approximately 2.3 times larger in the asexual colonies than in the sperm packets. Analysis of flagellar waveforms revealed that flagella from sperm packets and asexual colonies showed ciliary-type motion, whereas flagella from dissociated single sperm showed flagellar-type motion, suggesting the presence of a switching mechanism between sperm packets and dissociated sperm. Flagella from sperm packets were approximately 0.5 times shorter and had a beat period approximately twice as long as those from asexual colonies. The flagella of sperm packets were densely distributed over the anterior part of the body, whereas the flagella of asexual colonies were sparse and evenly distributed. The effect of the distribution of flagella, but not the number of flagella, seemed to illustrate the significant difference in the speeds between sperm packets and asexual colonies.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivePancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) can develop from precursor lesions, such as pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN), and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), with IPMN having a more favorable prognosis. Previous studies indicated that loss of Acvr1b accelerates the development of Kras-induced IPMN in the mouse pancreas, however, the cell type predominantly affected by these genetic changes remains unclear.\n\nDesignWe investigated the contribution of cellular origin by inducing IPMN associated mutations-KRASG12D expression and Acvr1b loss specifically in acinar (Ptf1aCreER;KrasLSL-G12D;Acvr1bfl/fl mice) or ductal (Sox9CreER;KrasLSL-G12D;Acvr1bfl/fl mice) cells in mice. We then performed MRI imaging and a thorough histopathological analysis of their pancreatic tissues.\n\nResultsThe loss of Acvr1b increased the risk of developing PanIN from cells with a Kras mutation. This was more pronounced in the context of acinar cells, which progressed faster and formed cysts that developed into IPMN and tumors. Ductal cells developed fewer PanIN lesions, and progressed less frequently into cysts, but were associated with dilation of the main pancreatic duct. Immunohistochemistry revealed that lesions arising from both cell types exhibited features of gastric or pancreatobiliary epithelium. The caerulein treatment further accelerated the development of IPMN from acinar cells with mutant Kras and loss of Acvr1b, but had no effect in ductal cells.\n\nConclusionThese findings indicate that loss of Acvr1b in the presence of the Kras oncogene promotes the development of precancerous lesions from both ductal and acinar cells, with lesions being more prevalent from acinar cells. Our study underscores the significance of the cellular context in the initiation and progression of precursor lesions from adult exocrine cells.",

Here, we report the isolation of an Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans strain from extremely low pH snottite biofilms in the karst at Frasassi, Italy. The strain grew to cell densities of >107 cells mL-1 in autotrophic sulfur comproportionation medium. Whole genome sequencing of the isolate revealed the presence of numerous genes involved in sulfur transformations that could be linked in a sulfur comproportionation pathway. We describe an experimental framework, including measurements of sulfate, sulfide, and S0 concentrations, electron microscopy, and stable and radioisotope incubations coupled with NanoSIMS, scintillation counting and isotope ratio mass spectrometry, for future searches of sulfur comproportionators.\n\nSignificanceThe prediction of and search for novel microbial catabolic reactions can be streamlined by using thermodynamics to identify energy-yielding redox reactions that may be catalyzed by microorganisms. This strategy has been used to successfully predict several previously overlooked microbial catabolic reactions, including anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox), anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM), and complete ammonia oxidation (comammox). Sulfur comproportionation, or the coupled reduction of sulfate and oxidation of sulfide to form elemental sulfur, was predicted by thermodynamic calculations to exist as a microbial catabolism in low pH, low-temperature environments. In this study, we describe the isolation of the first putative sulfur comproportionating microorganism and provide a detailed experimental approach that can be applied to future investigations of this novel link in the biogeochemical sulfur cycle.",

    "abstract": "The agr quorum-sensing system links Staphylococcus aureus metabolism to virulence, in part by increasing bacterial survival during exposure to lethal concentrations of H2O2, a crucial host defense against S. aureus. We now report that protection by agr surprisingly extends beyond post-exponential growth to the exit from stationary phase when the agr system is no longer turned on. Thus, agr can be considered a constitutive protective factor. Deletion of agr increased both respiration and aerobic fermentation but decreased ATP levels and growth, suggesting that {Delta}agr cells assume a hyperactive metabolic state in response to reduced metabolic efficiency. As expected from increased respiratory gene expression, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulated more in the agr mutant than in wild-type cells, thereby explaining elevated susceptibility of {Delta}agr strains to lethal H2O2 doses. Increased survival of wild-type agr cells during H2O2 exposure required sodA, which detoxifies superoxide. Additionally, pretreatment of S. aureus with respiration-reducing menadione protected {Delta}agr cells from killing by H2O2. Thus, genetic deletion and pharmacologic experiments indicate that agr helps control endogenous ROS, thereby providing resilience against exogenous ROS. The long-lived \"memory\" of agr-mediated protection, which is uncoupled from agr activation kinetics, increased hematogenous dissemination to certain tissues during sepsis in ROS-producing, wild-type mice but not ROS-deficient (Nox2-/-) mice. These results demonstrate the importance of protection that anticipates impending ROS-mediated immune attack. The ubiquity of quorum sensing suggests that it protects many bacterial species from oxidative damage.",

Molecular signaling cascade and target genes upon AHR activation and their contribution to cell and tissue function are however not fully understood. Multi-omics analyses using human skin keratinocytes revealed that, upon ligand activation, AHR binds open chromatin to induce expression of transcription factors (TFs), e.g., Transcription Factor AP-2 (TFAP2A), as a swift response to environmental stimuli. The terminal differentiation program including upregulation of barrier genes, filaggrin and keratins, was mediated by TFAP2A as a secondary response to AHR activation. The role of AHR-TFAP2A axis in controlling keratinocyte terminal differentiation for proper barrier formation was further confirmed using CRISPR/Cas9 in human epidermal equivalents. Overall, the study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanism behind AHR-mediated barrier function and potential novel targets for the treatment of skin barrier diseases.",

Previous work has shown that junction reinforcement at the furrow in Xenopus laevis epithelia regulates the speed of furrowing1. This suggests the cytokinetic array that drives cell division is subject to resistive forces from epithelial neighbor cells. We show here that contractility factors accumulate in neighboring cells near the furrow during cytokinesis. Additionally, increasing neighbor cell stiffness, via [a]-actinin overexpression, or contractility, through optogenetic Rho activation in one neighbor cell, slows or asymmetrically pauses furrowing, respectively. Notably, optogenetic stimulation of neighbor cell contractility on both sides of the furrow induces cytokinetic failure and binucleation. We conclude that forces from the cytokinetic array in the dividing cell are carefully balanced with restraining forces generated by neighbor cells, and neighbor cell mechanics regulate the speed and success of cytokinesis.\n\nHighlightsO_LINeighboring cells assemble actomyosin arrays adjacent to the cytokinetic furrow\nC_LIO_LIOverexpression of an F-actin cross-linker in neighbor cells slows furrowing\nC_LIO_LIOptogenetic activation of contractility in one neighbor pauses furrow ingression\nC_LIO_LIHyper-contractility in both neighbors restrains furrowing & cells fail cytokinesis\nC_LI",

The mutation causes abnormal hemorheological properties, mechanical hemolysis, and adhesion. The chronic vascular inflammation observed in SCD and hemolysis-related endothelium activation may trigger the vaso-occlusion of blood vessels.\n\nThe prothrombotic and pro-inflammatory LIGHT/TNFSF14 is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- superfamily cytokine implicated in various inflammatory diseases. It is expressed by various immune cells and is considered an actor in T cell-mediated immunity and immune cell recruitment. LIGHT has also been shown to activate endothelial cells (ECs) strongly. LIGHT levels are high in the plasma of SCD patients, and platelets are a major source of its circulating form.\n\nWe studied a cohort of 82 homozygous adult patients with SCD (n=108 samples) to determine whether LIGHT levels were linked to the clinical state of patients included in the  Basal steady state or during an  Acute crisis. Soluble LIGHT levels were high in the plasma of SCD patients during acute phases of the disease, particularly during painful occlusive crises. LIGHT levels were associated with Hb levels and inflammatory markers (mainly interferon-{gamma} and tumor necrosis factor-, specifically in acute SCD patients). Our findings confirm that LIGHT is a strong activator of cultured ECs, inducing a type II inflammatory cytokine profile and the expression of adhesion molecules. Using a physiological flow adhesion test on biochips, we showed that the LIGHT-induced activation of ECs led to the adhesion of both sickle platelets (but not their AA counterparts), and in a less extend sickle RBCs to activated HUVECs, potentially constituting the first step in vaso-occlusion. Indeed, the pretreatment of HUVECs with neutralizing polyclonal Abs against LIGHT, but not the non-specific counterpart, showed a reversal of both the inflammation process activated by LIGHT treatment and platelet adhesion to endothelial cells.\n\nSoluble LIGHT appears to be a promising therapeutic target for preventing adverse occlusive events in SCD through the blockade of its receptor, to prevent the adhesion of blood cell components to the endothelium.

    "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) affects over 13 million people world-wide annually and is associated with a fourfold increase in mortality. Our lab and others have shown that DNA damage response (DDR) governs the outcome of AKI in a bimodal manner. Activation of DDR sensor kinases protects against AKI, while hyperactivation of DDR effector proteins, such as p53, induces to cell death and worsens AKI. The factors that trigger the switch from pro-reparative to pro-cell death DDR remain to be resolved. Here we investigate the role of interleukin 22 (IL-22), an IL-10 family member whose receptor (IL-22RA1) is expressed on proximal tubule cells (PTCs), in DDR activation and AKI. Using cisplatin and aristolochic acid (AA) induced nephropathy as models of DNA damage, we identify PTCs as a novel source of urinary IL-22, making PTCs the only epithelial cells known to secret IL-22, to our knowledge. Functionally, IL-22 binding its receptor (IL-22RA1) on PTCs amplifies the DDR. Treating primary PTCs with IL-22 alone induces rapid activation of the DDR in vitro. The combination of IL-22 + cisplatin or AA treatment on primary PTCs induces cell death, while the same dose of cisplatin or AA alone does not. Global deletion of IL-22 protects against cisplatin or AA induced AKI. IL-22 deletion reduces expression of components of the DDR and inhibits PTC cell death. To confirm PTC IL-22 signaling contributes to AKI, we knocked out IL-22RA1 in renal epithelial cells by crossing IL-22RA1floxed mice with Six2-Cre mice. IL-22RA1 KO reduced DDR activation, cell death, and kidney injury. These data demonstrate that IL-22 promotes DDR activation in PTCs, switching pro-recovery DDR responses to a pro-cell death response and worsening AKI. Targeting IL-22 represents a novel therapeutic approach to prevent the negative consequences of the DDR activation while not interfering with the processes necessary for repair of damaged DNA.\n\nTranslational statementAcute kidney injury, which affects 10-20% of hospitalized patients, is associated with a fourfold increase in mortality and predisposes patients to chronic kidney disease. In the present study, we identify interleukin 22 as a cofactor which worsens acute kidney injury. Interleukin 22 activates the DNA damage response, which in combination with nephrotoxic drugs amplifies the injury response in kidney epithelial cells and increases cell death. Deletion of interleukin 22 from mice or its receptor from mouse kidneys ameliorates cisplatin induced nephropathy. These findings may help clarify the molecular mechanisms of DNA damage induced kidney injury and identify interventions that can help treat acute kidney injury.",

In patient-derived tumoroids, FGF19 provided a required growth signal for FGF19-negative cells, and its expression depended on both Wnt/-catenin and the biliary transcription factor SOX4. Our results reveal that a biliary lineage program induces FGF19 as a paracrine signal for tumor growth, thereby modulating the transcriptional outcome of constitutive Wnt activation and tumor cell proliferation.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to identify and evaluate the differences between the microbiome composition of the ileum and ceca of 1940 and 2016 genetic strains of white leghorns fed representative contemporary diets from those times. Ileal and cecal samples were aseptically collected from both genetic lines at 69 weeks of age. The genomic DNA of the ileal and cecal contents were extracted and the V4 region of the 16S rDNA was sequenced on an Illumina Miseq. Microbiota data were filtered and aligned using the QIIME2 2020.2 pipeline. Alpha and beta diversity metrics were generated and the Analysis of Composition of Microbiomes (ANCOM) was utilized to determine significantly different taxa. Data were considered significant at P [&le;] 0.05 for main effects and Q [&le;] 0.05 for pairwise differences. Alpha diversity of the ileum and ceca were significantly different (P = 0.001; Q = 0.001; however, no differences between genetic lineage were observed (P > 0.05; Q > 0.05). The beta diversity between the ileum and ceca, as well as between the genetic lines (1940 vs. 2016) were significantly different from one another (P = 0.001; Q = 0.001). Using ANCOM, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteriota were significantly different than other phyla (P 0.05) with a higher relative abundance of Proteobacteria being observed among treatment groups 2 and 3, while Actinobacteriota had higher relative abundance in treatment groups 1 and 4. Among the significantly different genera in the ileum, Pseudomonas, Rhizobiaceae, Leuconostoc, and Aeriscardovia were different (P 0.05) with treatment groups 1 and 4 having a higher relative abundance of Aeriscardovia, while treatment groups 2 and 3 had higher relative abundance in both Pseudomonas and Leuconostoc. In the ceca, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteriota, and Euryarchaeota were significantly different phyla (P 0.05) with Firmicutes having the highest relative abundance across all treatment groups. Among the significantly different genera (Pseudomonas, Leuconostoc, Alloprevotella, and Aeriscardovia), Alloprevotella had the highest relative abundance across all treatment groups 1 and 2, while Leuconostoc and Pseudomonas had the highest relative abundance in treatment group 4. Results from this study suggest that genetic makeup in conjunction with the nutritional composition of laying hens influences the cecal and ileal microbiota of corresponding hens.",

    "abstract": "Faithful segregation of chromosomes into daughter cells during mitosis requires formation of attachments between kinetochores and mitotic spindle microtubules. Chromosome alignment on the mitotic spindle, also referred to as congression, is facilitated by translocation of side-bound chromosomes along the microtubule surface, which allows the establishment of end-on attachment of kinetochores to microtubule plus ends. Spatial and temporal constraints hinder observation of these events in live cells. Therefore, we used our previously developed reconstitution assay to observe dynamics of kinetochores, the yeast kinesin-8, Kip3, and the microtubule polymerase, Stu2, in lysates prepared from metaphase-arrested budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to observe kinetochore translocation on the lateral microtubule surface toward the microtubule plus end, motility was shown to be dependent on both Kip3, as we reported previously, and Stu2. These proteins were shown to have distinct dynamics on the microtubule. Kip3 is highly processive and moves faster than the kinetochore. Stu2 tracks both growing and shrinking microtubule ends but also colocalizes with moving lattice-bound kinetochores. In cells, we observed that both Kip3 and Stu2 are important for establishing chromosome biorientation, Moreover, when both proteins are absent, biorientation is completely defective. All cells lacking both Kip3 and Stu2 had declustered kinetochores and about half also had at least one unattached kinetochore. Our evidence argues that despite differences in their dynamics, Kip3 and Stu2 share roles in chromosome congression to facilitate proper kinetochore-microtubule attachment.",

    "abstract": "The observed mutational spectrum of adaptive outcomes can be constrained by many factors. For example, mutational biases can narrow the observed spectrum by increasing the rate of mutation at isolated sites in the genome. In contrast, complex environments can shift the observed spectrum by defining fitness consequences of mutational routes. We investigate the impact of different nutrient environments on the evolution of motility in the bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-2x (an engineered non-motile derivative of Pf0-1) in the presence and absence of a strong mutational hotspot. Previous work has shown that this mutational hotspot can be built and broken via six silent mutations, which provide rapid access to a mutation that rescues swimming motility and confers the strongest swimming phenotype in specific environments. Here, we evolved a hotspot and non-hotspot variant strain of Pf0-2x for motility under nutrient rich (LB) and nutrient limiting (M9) environmental conditions. We observed the hotspot strain consistently evolved faster across all environmental conditions and its mutational spectrum was robust to environmental differences. However, the non-hotspot strain had a distinct mutational spectrum that changed depending on the nutrient environment. Interestingly, while alternative adaptive mutations in nutrient-rich environments were equal to, or less effective than, the hotspot mutation, the majority of these mutations in nutrient-limited conditions produced superior swimmers. Our competition experiments mirrored these findings, underscoring the role of environment in defining both the mutational spectrum and the associated phenotype strength. This indicates that while mutational hotspots working in concert with natural selection can speed up access to robust adaptive mutations (which can provide a competitive advantage in evolving populations) they can limit exploration of the mutational landscape, restricting access to potentially stronger phenotypes in specific environments.\n\nDATA SUMMARYAll data is available at OSF: DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/8BT2W, and in supplementary materials.",

    "abstract": "Two prokaryotic defence systems, Argonautes (pAgos) and CRISPR-Cas, detect invader nucleic acids using complementary guides. Upon recognition, the target is cleaved through nuclease activities of pAgo or Cas proteins thus protecting the cell from invasion. However, not all pAgos are active nucleases. Members of a large clade of short pAgos bind nucleic acid guides but lack nuclease activity suggesting a different mechanism of action. Here, we have investigated short pAgo from Novosphingopyxis baekryungensis (NbaAgo). We have shown that NbaAgo forms a heterodimeric complex, SPARDA, with a co-encoded effector nuclease. RNA-guided target DNA recognition unleashes the nuclease activity of SPARDA leading to indiscriminate collateral cleavage of DNA and RNA. Activation of SPARDA results in cell death during plasmid transformation or phage infection, thus protecting bacterial population from invaders. The collateral activity of SPARDA allows highly sensitive detection of specific DNA targets. SPARDA expands the list of prokaryotic immune systems that elicit suicidal cell response with a unique range of nuclease activities, creating additional opportunities for biotechnologies.",

    "abstract": "The CD93/IGFBP7 axis are key factors expressed in endothelial cells (EC) that mediate EC angiogenesis and migration. Upregulation of them contributes to tumor vascular abnormality and blockade of this interaction promotes a favorable tumor microenvironment for therapeutic interventions. However, how these two proteins associated to each other remains unclear. In this study, we solved the human CD93-IGFBP7 complex structure to elucidate the interaction between the EGF1 domain of CD93 and the IB domain of IGFBP7. Mutagenesis studies confirmed the binding interactions and specificities. Cellular and mouse tumor studies demonstrated the physiological relevance of the CD93-IGFBP7 interaction in EC angiogenesis. Our study provides hints for development of therapeutic agents to precisely disrupt unwanted CD93-IGFBP7 signaling in the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, analysis of the CD93 full-length architecture provides insights into how CD93 protrudes on the cell surface and forms a flexible platform for binding to IGFBP7 and other ligands.",

    "abstract": "Most mitochondrial proteins originate from the cytosol and require active transport into the organelle. Such precursor proteins must be largely unfolded to pass through translocation channels in mitochondrial membranes. Misfolding of transported proteins can result in their arrest and translocation failure. Arrested proteins block further import, disturbing mitochondrial functions and cellular proteostasis. Cellular responses to translocation failure have been defined in yeast. To discover molecular mechanisms that resolve failed import events in human cells, we developed the translocase clogging model using a fusion protein with a rigid domain. The mechanism we uncover differs significantly from these described in fungi, where ATPase-driven extraction of blocked protein is directly coupled with proteasomal processing. We found human cells to rely primarily on mitochondrial factors to clear translocation channel blockage. The mitochondrial membrane depolarization triggered proteolytic cleavage of the stalled protein, which involved mitochondrial protease OMA1. The cleavage allowed releasing the protein fragment that blocked the translocase. The released fragment was further cleared in the cytosol by the valosin containing protein (VCP)/p97 and proteasome.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis (AS), the molecular mechanisms of its pathogenesis are not fully understood. Endothelial dysfunction is the key initiating link in AS. However, whether endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is involved in the regulation of HHcy-induced endothelial dysfunction and the role of catalpol in it remain unexplored.\n\nMethods and ResultsIn vitro HHcy-treated primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were used to construct a model of endothelial dysfunction, and the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and catalase alcohol were administered. The endothelial dysfunction model was constructed by observing cell morphological changes, measuring intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) content, quantifying EndMT marker proteins (VE-cadherin, -SMA, N-cadherin) and p-p65 and p65 protein expression by western blot, and detecting VE-cadherin and -SMA fluorescence intensity by immunofluorescence. In vivo C57BL/6N mice were given a diet fed with 4.4% high methionine chow to construct a HHcy mice model and were treated with catalpol. The model was further validated by measuring the concentration of homocysteinemia (Hcy) in mice, HE and Masson staining to observe the pathological changes in the endothelium of aortic roots, immunohistochemistry to detect the expression of EndMT marker protein, immunofluorescence to detect the fluorescence intensity of p-p65, and fluorescent probe method to detect the content of ROS in the endothelium of aorta. The results showed that catalpol significantly inhibited HHcy-induced endothelial cell morphological transformation, reduced HHcy-induced increase in intracellular ROS content and -SMA, N-cadherin, p-p65 protein expression, increased HHcy-induced decrease in VE-cadherin, CD31 protein expression, and was able to protect against endothelial pathological changes in the aortic root and reduce aortic endothelial ROS content.\n\nConclusionsCatalpol inhibits HHcy-induced EndMT, and the underlying mechanism may be related to the ROS/NF-{kappa}B signaling pathway. Catalpol may be a potential drug for the treatment of HHcy-related AS.",
