    "abstract": "In environments with multiple predators, the vulnerabilities attached to the spatial positions of group-living prey are not uniform and depend on the hunting styles of the predators. Coursing predators, mainly canids and hyenas, follow their prey over long distances and attack open areas, making individuals at the edge of the group more dangerous than those at the center (marginal predation). In contrast, ambush predators, mainly cats, approach their prey undetected and appear randomly anywhere in the group; therefore, isolated individuals are at a greater risk of predation. However, identifying individuals at high risk of predation requires the simultaneous recording of predator locations and direct observation of predation events, which are both difficult. Therefore, several theoretical methods have been proposed to assess predation risk (predation risk proxies). In a group of wild anubis baboons exposed to predation by leopards, lions, and hyenas, we calculated predation risk proxies using movement data collected from global positioning system (GPS) collars and found that adult males were on the edge of the group with a higher risk of predation (Hypothesis 1). In addition, adult males were more isolated within this group (Hypothesis 2). None of the predation risks differed among the other age-sex classes. The most dominant male was expected to be in the safety center of the group (Hypothesis 3) but was isolated on the periphery, like the other males. Therefore, we discussed why adult males were more peripheral and isolated.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling is a key contributor to immune cell-mediated neuropathology in neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, we demonstrated a robust upregulation of type I interferon-stimulated genes in microglia and astrocytes following experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI). The specific molecular and cellular mechanisms by which IFN-I signaling impacts the neuroimmune response and neuropathology following TBI remains unknown. Using the lateral fluid percussion injury model (FPI) in adult male mice, we demonstrated that IFN /{beta} receptor (IFNAR) deficiency resulted in selective and sustained blockade of type I interferon-stimulated genes following TBI as well as decreased microgliosis and monocyte infiltration. Phenotypic alteration of reactive microglia also occurred with diminished expression of molecules needed for MHC class I antigen processing and presentation following TBI. This was associated with decreased accumulation of cytotoxic T cells in the brain. The IFNAR-dependent modulation of the neuroimmune response was accompanied by protection from secondary neuronal death, white matter disruption, and neurobehavioral dysfunction. These data support further efforts to leverage the IFN-I pathway for novel, targeted therapy of TBI.",

    "abstract": "As decisions require the gathering of relevant information, eye-tracking measures that capture the way visual information is typically acquired offer powerful indices of the dynamic decision-making process. This study is the second of a pair of studies that explore continuous measures of decision-making using remote, online tools in naturalistic settings. While cursor-tracking, used in the companion paper (Ouellette Zuk et al., 2023), enabled access to dynamic decision processes expressed during movement, in the present study, we now employ webcam eye-tracking to examine the dynamics of information gathering during decision making prior to movement initiation. Using three previously published binary choice tasks, we explored indices of decision difficulty in the gaze dynamics that would complement the motor measures in our companion paper. We find that harder choices elicit more eye dwells and longer final dwells, reflecting a decision resolution process that Ouellette Zuk et al. index during the final choice movement. Beyond this, we identify distinct gaze patterns uniquely employed in each task, revealing the utility and sensitivity of gaze metrics in illuminating the early difficulty-independent information gathering processes at play. Together, this paper series demonstrates the power of remote, online methods as tools for deeply understanding the complete, dynamic and continuous decision process, from the first glance to the final response.",

During periods of fasting, ketone bodies from the liver are transported into circulation and utilized as crucial fuel for peripheral tissues. However, the effects of fasting or ketogenesis on erythroid behavior remain unknown. Here, we generated a mouse model with insufficient ketogenesis by conditionally knocking out the gene encoding the hepatocyte-specific ketogenic enzyme hydroxymethylglutary-CoA synthase 2 (Hmgcs2 KO). Intriguingly, erythroid maturation was enhanced with boosted fatty acid synthesis in bone marrow of hepatic Hmgcs2 KO mouse under fasting condition, suggesting that systemic ketogenesis has a profound effect on erythropoiesis. Moreover, we observed significantly activated fatty acids synthesis and mevalonate pathway along with reduced histone acetylation in immature erythrocytes under less systemic ketogenesis condition. Our findings revealed an innovative insight to erythroid differentiation, in which metabolic homeostasis and histone acetylation mediated by ketone bodies are essential factors in adaptation towards nutrient deprivation and stressed erythropoiesis.",

    "abstract": "Neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) are pluripotent stem cells derived from the \"fourth germ layer\". Similar to mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), NCSCs can differentiate into a variety of cell types, such as adipocytes. However, the mechanism of NCSCs adipogenesis remains unclear. Previously, we have revealed that primary cells have neural crest and stem cell properties and can differentiate into adipocytes. Therefore, in this study, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of NCSCs at specific time points of adipogenesis were predicted by mRNA sequencing, the key genes of adipogenesis were predicted by principal component analysis, heat map, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis, and the expression of DEGs was verified by RT-qPCR. RNA interference (RNAi) technology was used to inhibit the expression of DEGs, and RT-qPCR and Western blot were used to explore the regulatory mechanism between DEGs. Sequencing results indicated a possible regulatory relationship between C/EBP, C/EBP{beta}, C/EBP{delta} and PPAR{gamma}. The results of RT-qPCR were consistent with those of mRNA sequencing. Combined with RT-qPCR and western blot results, we found that C/EBP{beta} and PPAR{gamma} regulated the transcription of C/EBP during NCSCs adipogenesis, and C/EBP{beta} and PPAR{gamma} formed positive feedback loop.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional regulation of azole resistance in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus is a key step in development of this problematic clinical phenotype. We and others have previously described a C2H2-containing transcription factor called FfmA that is required for normal levels of voriconazole susceptibility and expression of an ATP-binding cassette transporter gene called abcG1. Null alleles of ffmA exhibit a strongly compromised growth rate even in the absence of any external stress. Here we employ an acutely repressible doxycycline-off form of ffmA to rapidly deplete FfmA protein from the cell. Using this approach, we carried out RNA-seq analyses to probe the transcriptome of A. fumigatus cells that have been deprived of normal FfmA levels. We found that 2000 genes were differentially expressed upon depletion of FfmA, consistent with the wide-ranging effect of this factor on gene regulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high throughput DNA sequencing analysis (ChIP-seq) identified 530 genes that were bound by FfmA using two different antibodies for immunoprecipitation. More than 300 of these genes were also bound by AtrR demonstrating the striking regulatory overlap with FfmA. However, while AtrR is clearly an upstream activation protein with clear sequence specificity, our data suggest that FfmA is a chromatin-associated factor that may bind to DNA in a manner dependent on other factors. We provide evidence that AtrR and FfmA interact in the cell and can influence one anothers expression. This interaction of AtrR and FfmA is required for normal azole resistance in A. fumigatus.",

    "abstract": "The actomyosin cytoskeleton generates mechanical forces that power important cellular processes, such as cell migration, cell division, and mechanosensing. Actomyosin self-assembles into contractile networks and bundles that underlie force generation and transmission in cells. A central step is the assembly of the myosin II filament from myosin monomers, regulation of which has been extensively studied. However, myosin filaments are almost always found as clusters within the cell cortex. While recent studies characterized cluster nucleation dynamics at the cell periphery, how myosin clusters grow on stress fibers remains poorly characterized. Here, we utilize a U2OS osteosarcoma cell line with endogenously tagged myosin II to measure the myosin cluster size distribution in the lamella of adherent cells. We find that myosin clusters can grow with Rho-kinase (ROCK) activity alone in the absence of myosin motor activity. Time-lapse imaging reveals that myosin clusters grow via increased myosin association to existing clusters, which is potentiated by ROCK-dependent myosin filament assembly. Enabling myosin motor activity allows further myosin cluster growth through myosin association that is dependent on F-actin architecture. Using a toy model, we show that myosin self-affinity is sufficient to recapitulate the experimentally observed myosin cluster size distribution, and that myosin cluster sizes are determined by the pool of myosin available for cluster growth. Together, our findings provide new insights into the regulation of myosin cluster sizes within the lamellar actomyosin cytoskeleton.",

    "abstract": "Turtles and tortoises (Order Testudines) are facing an extinction crisis, and ecosystems are at risk of collapsing with the loss of key roles they play. Hatching failure is a crucial barrier to population growth and persistence, but its causes are poorly understood, and it is unknown whether fertilisation rates are declining as many populations become smaller and more female-biased. Here, we first show that fertilisation rates are considered in only a very small proportion of studies of turtle and tortoise hatching success, and those studies that do attempt to measure fertilisation rates use unreliable methods. We also show that studies of hatching success are biased towards marine turtles, as opposed to freshwater and terrestrial species, and wild rather than captive populations. We address the lack of reliable methods for assessing fertilisation rates in turtles and tortoises by developing and testing a microscopy-based method for detecting perivitelline membrane (PVM) bound sperm and embryonic nuclei in the germinal disc of unhatched eggs. We demonstrate that this method can provide unequivocal evidence of egg fertilisation in three different turtle and tortoise species from both captive and wild populations, even after eggs have been left in the nest for the full incubation period. This approach therefore represents a valuable new tool for monitoring egg fertility and embryo survival rates in turtles and tortoises, with the potential to provide important insights into the underlying drivers of reproductive failure in threatened populations.",

    "abstract": "Imidacloprid is a global health threat that severely poisons the economically and ecologically important honeybee pollinator, Apis mellifera. However, its effects on developing bee larvae remain largely unexplored. Our pilot study showed that imidacloprid causes developmental delay in bee larvae, but the underlying toxicological mechanisms remain incompletely understood. In this study, we exposed bee larvae to imidacloprid at environmentally relevant concentrations of 0.7, 1.2, 3.1, and 377 ppb. There was a marked dose-dependent delay in larval development, characterized by reductions in body mass, width, and growth index. However, imidacloprid did not affect on larval survival and food consumption. The primary toxicological effects induced by elevated concentrations of imidacloprid (377 ppb) included inhibition of neural transmission gene expression, induction of oxidative stress, gut structural damage, and apoptosis, inhibition of developmental regulatory hormones and genes, suppression of gene expression levels involved in proteolysis, amino acid transport, protein synthesis, carbohydrate catabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolysis energy production. In addition, we found that the larvae may use antioxidant defenses and P450 detoxification mechanisms to mitigate the effects of imidacloprid. Ultimately, this study provides the first evidence that environmentally exposed imidacloprid can affect the growth and development of bee larvae by disrupting molting regulation and limiting the metabolism and utilization of dietary nutrients and energy. These findings have broader implications for studies assessing pesticide hazards in other juvenile animals.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=104 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/543803v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (48K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1159d2borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@174a8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@191e99aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7f9f17_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the functional network underlying response inhibition in the human brain, particularly the role of the basal ganglia in successful response inhibition. We provide evidence that the canonical inhibition pathways may not be recruited during successful response inhibition during the stop signal task (SST). Instead, subcortical nodes including the substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus, thalamus, and ventral tegmental area are more likely to be activated during failed stop trials, suggesting that successful inhibition does not rely on the recruitment of these nodes. The findings challenge previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of the SST and suggest the need to ascribe a separate function to these networks. We also highlight the substantial effect smoothing can have on the conclusions drawn from task-specific GLMs. This study presents a proof of concept for meta-analytical methods that enable the merging of extensive, unprocessed or unreduced datasets. It demonstrates the significant potential that open-access data sharing can offer to the research community.

We find the VPS35[D620N] mutation alters expression of [~]350 lysosomal proteins and stimulates LRRK2 phosphorylation of Rab proteins at the lysosome. This recruits the phosphoRab effector protein RILPL1 to the lysosome where it binds to the lysosomal integral membrane protein TMEM55B. We identify highly conserved regions of RILPL1 and TMEM55B that interact and design mutations that block binding. In mouse fibroblasts, brain, and lung, we demonstrate that the VPS35 [D620N] mutation reduces RILPL1 levels, in a manner reversed by LRRK2 inhibition. Knock-out of RILPL1 enhances phosphorylation of Rab substrates and knock-out of TMEM55B increases RILPL1 levels.

Here we provide novel insights into the temporospatial requirement for cilia in SBDs arising from deficiency in Ift140, an intraflagellar transport protein regulating ciliogenesis. Ift140 deficient mice exhibit cilia defects accompanied by wide spectrum of SBDs including macrostomia (craniofacial defects), exencephaly, body wall defects, tracheoesophageal fistula, randomized heart looping, congenital heart defects (CHD), lung hypoplasia, renal anomalies, and polydactyly. Tamoxifen inducible CAG-Cre deletion of a floxed Ift140 allele between E5.5 to 9.5 revealed early requirement for Ift140 in left-right heart looping regulation, mid to late requirement for cardiac outflow septation and alignment, and late requirement for craniofacial development and body wall closure. Surprisingly, CHD was not observed with four Cre drivers targeting different lineages essential for heart development, but craniofacial defects and omphalocele were observed with Wnt1-Cre targeting neural crest and Tbx18-Cre targeting epicardial lineage and rostral sclerotome through which trunk neural crest cells migrate. These findings revealed cell autonomous role of cilia in cranial/trunk neural crest mediated craniofacial and body wall closure defects, while non-cell autonomous multi-lineage interactions underlie CHD pathogenesis, revealing unexpected developmental complexity for CHD associated with ciliopathy.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionDuchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a X-linked fatal myogenic disorder, in which lack of dystrophin leads to significant fibrosis and a progressive loss of muscle mass. Regeneration of the muscles in response to the degeneration is not adequate to contribute to restoration of muscle function. Having proven the anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties of the 1,3-1,6 B-glucan (Neu REFIX) produced by the N-163 strain of Aureobasidium Pullulans in clinical and pre-clinical studies, we have now examined its effects on muscle regeneration in a DMD animal model of mdx mice.\n\nMethodsForty-five mice were divided into the three groups, Gr. 1 (n=15): normal mice, Gr.2 (n=15): mdx mice as vehicle, Gr.3 (n=15) mdx mice administered the N-163 {beta}-glucan for 45 days. Expression of CD44 and Myosin heavy chain (MYH3) were evaluated in the skeletal muscles.\n\nResultsIn the Gr.3 (N-163 group), CD44+ve staining in immunohistochemistry was more intense, with an H-score of > 2.0 as opposed to 1.0 in Gr. 2 and 0.1 in Gr. 1. Immunofluorescence staining showed 20% higher MYH3-staining positive area in Gr.3 (N-163 group) than that in the Gr.2.\n\nConclusionSuccessful muscle regeneration indicated by (i) increased MYH3 expression, characteristic of early myosin and muscle formation, followed by (ii) differentiation evident by an increase in CD44, upon oral feeding of N-163 B-Glucan, have been proven in this study. The earlier reported anti-fibrosis and anti-inflammatory effects in pre-clinical and human clinical studies along with the present studys findings, unravel the potentials of this safe B-Glucan food supplement as a disease modifying adjunct in the management of DMD and other muscular dystrophies.",

    "abstract": "Voltage-gated sodium channels are crucial to action potential propagation in excitable tissues. Voltage-clamp measurements of sodium current are very challenging and are usually performed at room temperature due to the high amplitude and fast activation of the current. In this study, we measured sodium currents voltage dependence in stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes at physiological temperature. Although apparent activation and inactivation curves measured as the sodium current amplitude dependence on voltage step is within the range reported in previous studies, we demonstrate a systematic error in our measurements that is due to deviation of membrane potential from the command potential of the amplifier. We show how this artifact can be accounted for by the computer simulation of the patch-clamp experiment. This patch-clamp model optimization technique yields a surprising result: -11.5 mV half-activation and -87 mV half-inactivation of the sodium current. Although the half-activation is strikingly different from what was previously believed to be typical for the cardiac sodium current, we show that this estimate explains conduction velocity dependence on extracellular potassium in hyperkalemic conditions.\n\nKey pointsO_LIVoltage gated sodium currents play a crucial role in excitable tissues including neurons, cardiac and skeletal muscles.\nC_LIO_LIMeasurement of sodium current is challenging because of its high amplitude and rapid kinetics, especially at physiological temperature.\nC_LIO_LIWe have used the patch-clamp technique to measure human sodium current voltage-dependence in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.\nC_LIO_LIThe patch-clamp data was processed by optimization of the model accounting for voltage-clamp experiment artifacts, revealing a large difference between apparent parameters of sodium current and the results of the optimization.\nC_LIO_LIWe conclude that actual sodium current activation is extremely depolarized in comparison to previous studies.\nC_LIO_LIThe new sodium current model provides a better understanding of action potential propagation, we demonstrate that it explains propagation in hyperkalemic conditions.\nC_LI",

Here we mapped the distribution of pTau at various stages of cortical pathology in post-mortem human thalamus. We found that calretinin-expressing neurons of the anterodorsal nucleus are highly vulnerable to pTau even at the earliest stage. At the subcellular level, pTau filaments were detected in cell bodies and at both postsynaptic and presynaptic sites. Moreover, pTau accumulated in large presynaptic vesicular-glutamate-transporter-2-containing terminals arising from the mammillary body, but not in small corticothalamic terminals, suggesting that Tau crosses synapses at select glutamatergic synaptic sites. These data define a subcortical route of Tau propagation that may drive pathology via the thalamus to the cortex.\n\nOne-Sentence SummarySynaptic terminals containing vesicular glutamate transporter 2 preferentially accumulate pathological Tau proteins in the human thalamus.",

    "abstract": "Grey matter heterotopia (GMH) are neurodevelopmental disorders associated with abnormal cortical function and epilepsy. Subcortical band heterotopia (SBH) and periventricular nodular heterotopia (PVNH) are two well-recognized GMH subtypes in which neurons are misplaced, either forming nodules lining the ventricles in PVNH, or forming bands in the white matter in SBH. Although both PVNH and SBH are commonly associated with epilepsy, it is unclear whether these two GMH subtypes differ in terms of pathological consequences or, on the contrary, share common altered mechanisms. Here, we studied two robust preclinical models of SBH and PVNH, and performed a systematic comparative assessment of the physiological and morphological diversity of heterotopia neurons, as well as the dynamics of epileptiform activity and input connectivity. We uncovered a complex set of altered properties, including both common and distinct physiological and morphological features across heterotopia subtypes, and associated with specific dynamics of epileptiform activity. Taken together, these results suggest that pro-epileptic circuits in GMH are, at least in part, composed of neurons with distinct, subtype-specific, physiological and morphological properties depending on the heterotopia subtype. Our work supports the notion that GMH represent a complex set of disorders, associating both shared and diverging pathological consequences, and contributing to forming epileptogenic networks with specific properties. A deeper understanding of these properties may help to refine current GMH classification schemes by identifying morpho-electric signatures of GMH subtypes, to potentially inform new treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "Psoriatic arthritis mutilans (PAM) is the rarest and most severe form of psoriatic arthritis. PAM is characterized by erosions of the small joints of hands and feet and osteolysis leading to joint disruption. Despite its severity, the underlying mechanisms are unknown, and no candidate susceptibility genes have hitherto been identified. We aimed to investigate the genetic basis of PAM. We performed massive parallel sequencing of sixty-one patients genomes from the PAM Nordic cohort. We validated the rare variants found by Sanger sequencing and genotyped additional psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and control cohorts. We then tested the role of the variants using in vivo and in vitro models. We found rare variants with a minor allele frequency (MAF) below 0.0001 in the NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) in four patients. In silico predictions show that the identified variants are potentially damaging. NOXs are the only enzymes producing reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are highly reactive molecules important role in the regulation of signal transduction. NOX4 is specifically involved in the differentiation of osteoclasts, the cells implicated in bone resorption. Functional follow-up studies using cell culture, zebrafish models, and measurement of ROS in patients uncovered that the NOX4 variants found in this study increase the levels of ROS both in vitro and in vivo. We propose NOX4 as the first candidate susceptibility gene for PAM. Our study links high levels of ROS caused by NOX4 variants to the development of PAM, opening the possibility for a potential therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is the primary method that can measure the levels of metabolites in the brain in vivo. To achieve its potential in clinical usage, the reliability of the measurement requires further articulation. Although there are many studies that investigate the reliability of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), comparatively few studies have investigated the reliability of other brain metabolites, such as glutamate (Glu), N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), phosphocreatine (PCr), or myo-inositol (mI), which all play a significant role in brain development and functions. In addition, previous studies which predominately used only two measurements (two datapoints) failed to provide the details of the time effect (e.g., time-of-day) on MRS measurement within subjects. Therefore, in this study, MRS data located in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) were repeatedly recorded across one year leading to at least 25 sessions for each subject with the aim of exploring the variability of other metabolites by using the index coefficient of variability (CV); the smaller the CV, the more reliable the measurements. We found that the metabolites of NAA, tNAA, and tCr showed the smallest CVs (between 1.61 and 4.90 %), and the metabolites of Glu, Glx, mI, and tCho showed modest CVs (between 4.26 and 7.89 %). Furthermore, we found that the concentration reference of the ratio to water with tissue correction results in smaller CVs compared to the ratio to tCr. In addition, we did not find any time-of-day effect on the MRS measurements. Collectively, the results of this study indicate that the MRS measurement is reasonably reliable in quantifying the levels of metabolites.\n\nKey pointsThe MRS measurement is reliable within subject.\n\nThe ratio to water provides more reliable results compared to the ratio to tCr.\n\nThe ratio to water is recommended as the internal concentration reference.",

    "abstract": "Decision-making often manifests in behavior, typically yielding overt motor actions. This complex process requires the registration of sensory information with ones internal representation of the current context, before a categorical judgment of the most appropriate motor behavior can be issued. The construct concept of embodied decision-making encapsulates this sequence of complex processes, whereby behaviorally salient information from the environment is represented in an abstracted space of potential motor actions rather than only in an abstract cognitive \"decision\" space. Theoretical foundations and some empirical evidence account for support the involvement of premotor cortical circuits in embodied cognitive functions. Animal models show that premotor circuits participate in the registration and evaluation of actions performed by peers in social situations, that is, prior to controlling ones voluntary movements guided by arbitrary stimulus-response rules. However, such evidence from human data is currently limited. Here we used time-resolved magnetoencephalography imaging to characterize activations of the premotor cortex as human participants observed arbitrary, non-biological visual stimuli that either respected or violated a simple stimulus-response association rule. The participants had learned this rule previously, either actively, by performing a motor task (active learning), or passively, by observing a computer perform the same task (passive learning). We discovered that the human premotor cortex is activated during the passive observation of the correct execution of a sequence of events according to a rule learned previously. Premotor activation also differs when the subjects observe incorrect stimulus sequences. These premotor effects are present even when the observed events are of a non-motor, abstract nature, and even when the stimulus-response association rule was learned via passive observations of a computer agent performing the task, without requiring overt motor actions from the human participant. We found evidence of these phenomena by tracking cortical beta-band signaling in temporal alignment with the observation of task events and behavior. We conclude that premotor cortical circuits that are typically engaged during voluntary motor behavior are also involved in the interpretation of events of a non-ecological, unfamiliar nature but related to a learned abstract rule. As such, the present study provides the first evidence of neurophysiological processes of embodied decision-making in human premotor circuits when the observed events do not involve motor actions of a third party.",

    "abstract": "Tissue iron overload is a frequent pathologic finding in multiple disease states including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), neurodegenerative disorders, cardiomyopathy, diabetes, and some forms of cancer. The role of iron, as a cause or consequence of disease progression and observed phenotypic manifestations, remains controversial. In addition, the impact of genetic variation on iron overload related phenotypes is unclear, and the identification of genetic modifiers is incomplete. Here, we used the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP), consisting of over 100 genetically distinct mouse strains optimized for genome-wide association studies and systems genetics, to characterize the genetic architecture of dietary iron overload and pathology. Dietary iron overload was induced by feeding male mice (114 strains, 6-7 mice per strain on average) a high iron diet for six weeks, and then tissues were collected at 10-11 weeks of age. Liver metal levels and gene expression were measured by ICP-MS/ICP-AES and RNASeq, and lipids were measured by colorimetric assays. FaST-LMM was used for genetic mapping, and Metascape, WGCNA, and Mergeomics were used for pathway, module, and key driver bioinformatics analyses. Mice on the high iron diet accumulated iron in the liver, with a 6.5 fold difference across strain means. The iron loaded diet also led to a spectrum of copper deficiency and anemia, with liver copper levels highly positively correlated with red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit. Hepatic steatosis of various severity was observed histologically, with 52.5 fold variation in triglyceride levels across the strains. Liver triglyceride and iron mapped most significantly to an overlapping locus on chromosome 7 that has not been previously associated with either trait. Based on network modeling, significant key drivers for both iron and triglyceride accumulation are involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and oxidative stress management. To make the full data set accessible and useable by others, we have made our data and analyses available on a resource website.\n\nAuthor summaryThe response to a high iron diet is determined in part by genetic factors. We now report the responses to such a diet in a diverse set of inbred strains of mice, known as the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel, that enables high resolution genetic mapping and systems genetics analyses. The levels of iron in the liver varied about >5 fold across the strains, with genetic variation explaining up to 74% of the variation in liver iron. Pathologies included copper deficiency, anemia, and fatty liver, with liver triglycerides varying over 50 fold among the strains. Genetic mapping and network modeling identified significant genetic loci and pathways underlying the response to diet.",

    "abstract": "Membrane transporters play a fundamental role in the tissue distribution of endogenous compounds and xenobiotics and are major determinants of efficacy and side effects profiles. Polymorphisms within these drug transporters result in inter-individual variation in drug response, with some patients not responding to the recommended dosage of drug whereas others experience catastrophic side effects. For example, variants within the major hepatic Human organic cation transporter OCT1 (SLC22A1) can change endogenous organic cations and many prescription drug levels. To understand how variants mechanistically impact drug uptake, we systematically study how all known and possible single missense and single amino acid deletion variants impact expression and substrate uptake of OCT1. We find that human variants primarily disrupt function via folding rather than substrate uptake. Our study revealed that the major determinants of folding reside in the first 300 amino acids, including the first 6 transmembrane domains and the extracellular domain (ECD) with a stabilizing and highly conserved stabilizing helical motif making key interactions between the ECD and transmembrane domains. Using the functional data combined with computational approaches, we determine and validate a structure-function model of OCT1s conformational ensemble without experimental structures. Using this model and molecular dynamic simulations of key mutants, we determine biophysical mechanisms for how specific human variants alter transport phenotypes. We identify differences in frequencies of reduced function alleles across populations with East Asians vs European populations having the lowest and highest frequency of reduced function variants, respectively. Mining human population databases reveals that reduced function alleles of OCT1 identified in this study associate significantly with high LDL cholesterol levels. Our general approach broadly applied could transform the landscape of precision medicine by producing a mechanistic basis for understanding the effects of human mutations on disease and drug response.",

Using lesion network mapping, we examined whether alterations in NS were causally associated with lesions to specific brain networks. We assessed for strength of replication across datasets and specificity against other personality traits.\n\nResultsLesion locations that are linked to NS map to a common brain with its largest cluster in the dorsal cingulate.

    "abstract": "As decisions require actions to have an effect on the world, measures derived from movements such as using a mouse to control a cursor on a screen provide powerful and dynamic indices of decision-making. In this first of a set of two studies, we replicated classic reach-decision paradigms across computers, tablets, and smartphones, we show that portable touch-devices can sensitively capture decision-difficulty. We see this in pre- and during-movement temporal and motoric measures across diverse decision domains. We found touchscreen interactions to more sensitively reflect decision-difficulty during movement compared to computer interactions, and the latter to be more sensitive before movement initiation. Paired with additional evidence for the flexibility and unique utility of pre- and during-movement measures, this substantiates the use of widely available touch-devices to massively extend the reach of decision science. We build upon this in the second study in this series (Bertrand et al., 2023) with the use of webcam eye-tracking to further elucidate, earlier in time, the decision process. This subsequent work provides additional support for tools that enable remote collection of rich decision data in ecologically-valid environments.",

    "abstract": "Many pathogens evolved compartmentalized genomes with conserved core and variable accessory regions which carry effector genes mediating virulence. The fungal plant pathogen Fusarium oxysporum has such accessory regions, often spanning entire chromosomes, yet understanding of their evolution in strains that infect the same host remains limited. Here, we define the pan-genome of 69 diverse Fusarium strains that cause Fusarium wilt of banana, a significant constraint to global banana production, and demonstrate that segmental duplications drive the evolution of accessory regions. Accessory regions are highly variable and encode distinct gene repertories, with evolutionarily less constrained, younger genes and in planta- induced effectors, which differ between strains infecting the same banana cultivars. We show that recent segmental duplications and aneuploidy of accessory chromosomes cause the expansion of accessory regions in some Fusarium species. Taken together we conclude that extensive recent duplications drive the evolution of accessory regions in Fusarium, which contribute to the evolution of virulence.",

    "abstract": "Malfunction of the CFTR protein results in cystic fibrosis, one of the most common hereditary diseases. CFTR functions as an anion channel, the gating of which is controlled by long-range allosteric communications. Allostery also has direct bearings on CF treatment: CFTR drugs bind at the periphery of the protein yet affect the gating residues that lie at the center of it. Herein, we combined two computational approaches; Anisotropic Normal Mode-Langevin dynamics (ANM-LD) and Transfer Entropy (TE) and investigated the allosteric communications network of CFTR. The results are in excellent agreement with experimental observations and provide extensive novel insight. We identified residues that serve as pivotal allosteric sources and transducers, many of which correspond to disease causing mutations. We observe that the degenerate and catalytic ATP sites asymmetrically contribute to the allosteric communication, and that the catalytic site provides the greater allosteric input. We demonstrate that drugs that potentiate CFTRs conductance do so not by directly acting on the gating residues, but rather by mimicking the allosteric signal sent by the ATP binding sites. We identify a hitherto unknown allosteric hotspot near the docking site of the phosphorylated R domain, providing a molecular basis for its phosphorylation dependent excitatory role. This study uncovers the molecular basis of allosteric connectivity in CFTR and reveals a novel allosteric hotspot that can serve as a target for the development of novel therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "The crosstalk between prostate cancer (PCa) cells and the tumor microenvironment plays a pivotal role in disease progression and metastasis and could provide novel opportunities for patient treatment. Macrophages are the most abundant immune cells in the prostate tumor microenvironment (TME) and are capable of killing tumor cells. To identify genes in the tumor cells that are critical for macrophage-mediated killing, we performed a genome-wide co-culture CRISPR screen and identified AR, PRKCD, and multiple components of the NF-{kappa}B pathway as hits, whose expression in the tumor cell are essential for being targeted and killed by macrophages. These data position AR signaling as an immunomodulator, and confirmed by androgen-deprivation experiments, that rendered hormone-deprived tumor cells resistant to macrophage-mediated killing. Proteomic analyses showed a downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation in the PRKCD- and IKBKG-KO cells compared to the control, suggesting impaired mitochondrial function, which was confirmed by electron microscopy analyses. Furthermore, phosphoproteomic analyses revealed that all hits impaired ferroptosis signaling, which was validated transcriptionally using samples from a neoadjuvant clinical trial with the AR-inhibitor enzalutamide.\n\nCollectively, our data demonstrate that AR functions together with the PRKCD and the NF-{kappa}B pathway to evade macrophage-mediated killing. As hormonal intervention represents the mainstay therapy for treatment of prostate cancer patients, our findings may have direct implications and provide a plausible explanation for the clinically observed persistence of tumor cells despite androgen deprivation therapy.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has attributed to stress not only by the infection itself but also by social isolation owing to self-quarantine and social distancing. Stress has adverse effects on the mental health and chronic medical diseases; the potential of stress-induced somatic mutations in the brain to cause psychiatric disorders is being studied. Here we conducted behavioral studies, protein expression studies, single-nucleus sequencing (snRNAseq), and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of the hippocampus of mice that underwent early maternal separation and social isolation, and a demographic study of community populations who had been self-quarantined owing to COVID-19 exposure to investigate the link between somatic mutations and stress due to social isolation. The demographic study demonstrated more negative mental health findings among individuals who live alone or are single. Mice subjected to early maternal separation and social isolation demonstrated increased anxiety-like behaviors and stress-related corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1, and neurogenesis-related sex-determining region Y-box 2 and doublecortin expression. In snRNA-seq, differences, such as transthyretin increase, were observed in the maternal separation group, and somatic mutations, including insertion in the intron site of Tmem267, were observed in the social isolation group on WGS. The results of this study suggest that stress, such as social isolation, can cause changes at the genetic level, as well as behavioral and brain protein changes.",

    "abstract": "According to predictive processing theories of perception, the brain generates predictions to prepare for sensory input, and calibrates certainty of predictions based on their likelihood. When an input doesnt match the prediction, an error signal leads to updating of the predictive model. Prior research suggests altered prediction certainty in autism, but predictive processing occurs across the cortical hierarchy, and the stage(s) of processing where prediction certainty breaks down is unknown. We therefore tested the integrity of prediction certainty in autism at pre-attentive and relatively automatic processing stages using the pre-attentive Mismatch Negativity (MMN) brain response. The MMN occurs in response to a \"deviant\" presented in a stream of \"standards\" and is measured while the participant performs an orthogonal task. Most critically, MMN amplitude typically varies with the level of certainty associated with the prediction. We recorded high-density EEG while presenting adolescents and young adults with and without autism with repetitive tones every half second (the standard) interspersed with infrequent pitch and inter-stimulus-interval (ISI) deviants. Pitch and ISI deviant probabilities were manipulated at 4, 8, or 16% within a block of trials to test whether MMN amplitude varied in a typical manner with respect to probability. For both groups, Pitch-MMN amplitude increased as the probability of deviance decreased. Unexpectedly, ISI-MMN amplitude did not reliably vary by probability in either group. Our Pitch-MMN findings suggest intact neural representation of pre-attentive prediction certainty in autism, addressing a critical knowledge gap in autism research. The implications of these findings are considered.\n\nLAY SUMMARYOur brains are always trying to predict what will happen next. For example, when you open your utensil drawer, it would be surprising to see books because your brain expected to see utensils. In our study, we looked at whether the brains of autistic individuals automatically and accurately recognize when something unexpected happens. Results showed similar brain patterns in individuals with and without autism, suggesting that responses to prediction violations are generated in a typical manner during early cortical information processing.",

    "abstract": "Piperaquine (PPQ) is widely used in combination with dihydroartemisinin (DHA) as a first-line treatment against malaria parasites. Resistance to this artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) has emerged in Cambodia and threatens to spread to other malaria-endemic regions. Multiple drivers of PPQ resistance have been reported, including mutations in the Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) and increased copies of plasmepsin II/III (pm). Experimental genetic crosses allow for the precise quantification of the relative contributions of specific loci to a phenotype and have the distinct advantage of assaying the effects of naturally evolved genetic variation. We generated a cross between a Cambodia-derived multi-drug resistant KEL1/PLA1 lineage parasite isolate (KH004) and a drug susceptible parasite isolated in Malawi (Mal31). Mal31 harbors a wild-type (3D7-like) pfcrt allele and a single copy of pm, while KH004 has a chloroquine-resistant (Dd2-like) pfcrt allele with an additional G367C substitution and four copies of pm. We cloned 101 unique recombinant progeny from this cross, and from this pool, we identified a targeted set of progeny representing all possible combinations of variants at pfcrt and pm for detailed analysis of a range of PPQ response and competitive fitness phenotypes. Fortuitously, progeny clones that inherited the KH004 pm allele displayed a range of different copies, allowing us to directly test the role of pm copy number on a range of resistance phenotypes, including IC50, area under the curve (AUC), and PSA as well as competitive fitness. We find that all progeny inheriting both pfcrt and pm alleles from KH004 are PPQ resistant by (PSA and AUC) and that inheritance of KH004 pfcrt is required for resistance (including progeny that inherited the single copy pm from Mal31). Our findings clearly display how progeny clones from experimental crosses can be used to parse apart the contributions of pfcrt, pm, and parasite genetic background, to a range of PPQ-related traits and confirm the critical role of the PfCRT G367C substitution on PPQ resistance.",

    "abstract": "CTLA-4 is a crucial immune checkpoint receptor involved in the maintenance of immune homeostasis, tolerance, and tumour control. Antibodies targeting CTLA-4 have been promising treatment for numerous cancers, but the mechanistic basis of their anti-tumoral immune boosting effects are poorly understood. Although the ctla4 gene also encodes an alternatively-spliced soluble variant (sCTLA-4), preclinical/clinical evaluation of anti-CTLA-4-based immunotherapies have not considered the contribution of this isoform. Here, we explore the functional properties of sCTLA-4 and evaluate the efficacy of isoform-specific anti-sCTLA-4 antibody targeting in murine cancer model. We show that expression of sCTLA-4 in tumour cells suppresses CD8+ T-cells in vitro, and accelerates growth and experimental metastasis of murine tumours in vivo. These effects were accompanied by modification of the immune infiltrate, notably restraining CD8+ T-cells in a non-effector state. sCTLA-4 blockade with isoform-specific antibody reversed this restraint, enhancing intratumoural CD8+ T-cell activation and cytolytic potential, correlating with therapeutic efficacy and tumour control. This previously unappreciated role of sCTLA-4 suggests that better understanding of the biology and function of multi-gene products of immune checkpoint receptors needs to be fully elucidated for improved cancer immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Despite overall good prognosis associated to thyroid cancer (TC), poorly differentiated carcinomas (PDTC) and anaplastic carcinomas (ATC, one of the most lethal human malignancies) represent major clinical challenges. We have shown that the presence of active T172-phosphorylated CDK4 predicts sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitory drugs (CDK4/6i) including palbociclib. Here, CDK4 phosphorylation was detected in all well-differentiated TC (n=29), 19/20 PDTC, 16/23 ATC, and 18/21 TC cell lines including 11 ATC-derived ones. The cell lines lacking CDK4 phosphorylation were insensitive to CDK4/6i. RNA-sequencing and immunohistochemistry revealed that tumors and cell lines without phosphorylated CDK4 presented very high p16CDKN2A levels that were associated with proliferative activity. No RB1 mutations were found in 5 of these 7 tumors. p16/KI67 immunohistochemistry and a previously developed 11-gene signature identified the likely insensitive tumors lacking CDK4 phosphorylation. In cell lines, palbociclib synergized with dabrafenib/trametinib, completely and irreversibly arresting proliferation. The combined drugs prevented resistance mechanisms induced by palbociclib, most notably Cyclin E1-CDK2 activation and a paradoxical stabilization of phosphorylated CDK4 complexes. Our study supports the evaluation of CDK4/6i for ATC/PDTC treatment, including in combination with MEK/BRAF inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Dominance status has extensive effects on physical and mental health, and an individuals relative position can be shaped by experiential factors. A variety of considerations suggest that the experience of behavioral control over stressors should produce winning in dominance tests and that winning should blunt the impact of later stressors, as does prior control. To investigate the interplay between competitive success and stressor control, we first examined the impact of stressor controllability on subsequent performance in a warm spot competition test modified for rats. Prior experience of controllable, but not physically identical uncontrollable, stress increased later effortful behavior and occupation of the warm spot. Controllable stress subjects consistently ranked higher than did uncontrollable stress subjects. Pharmacological inactivation of the prelimbic (PL) cortex during behavioral control prevented later facilitation of dominance. Next, we explored whether repeated winning experiences produced later resistance against the typical sequelae of uncontrollable stress. To establish dominance status, triads of rats were given five sessions of warm spot competition. Reversible inactivation of the PL or NMDA receptor blockade in the dorsomedial striatum led to a long-term reduction in social rank. Stable dominance blunted the later stress-induced increase in dorsal raphe nucleus serotonergic activity, as well as prevented stress-induced social avoidance. In contrast, endocrine and neuroimmune responses to uncontrollable stress were unaffected, indicating a selective impact of prior dominance. Together, these data demonstrate that instrumental control over stress promotes later dominance, but also reveal that winning experiences buffer against the neural and behavioral outcomes of future adversity.",

However, the impacts of these variants on gene regulation have not been investigated in cattle. Here, we genotyped and characterized 19,408 SVs and 374,821 STRs in 183 bovine genomes and investigated their impact on molecular phenotypes derived from testis transcriptomes. We found that 71% STRs were multiallelic. The vast majority (95%) of STRs and SVs were in intergenic and intronic regions. Only 37% SVs and 40% STRs were in high LD (R2>0.8) with surrounding SNPs/Indels, indicating that SNP-based association testing and genomic prediction are blind to a non-negligible portion of genetic variation. We showed that both SVs and STRs were more than two-fold enriched among expression and splicing QTL (e/sQTL) relative to SNPs/Indels and were often associated with differential expression and splicing of multiple genes. Deletions and duplications had larger impacts on splicing and expression than any other type of structural variant. Exonic duplications predominantly increased gene expression either through alternative splicing or other mechanisms, whereas expression- and splicing-associated STRs primarily resided in intronic regions and exhibited bimodal effects on the molecular phenotypes investigated. Most e/sQTL resided within 100 kb of the affected genes or splicing junctions. We pinpoint candidate causal STRs and SVs associated with the expression of SLC13A4 and TTC7B, and alternative splicing of a lncRNA and CAPP1. We provide a catalogue of STRs and SVs for taurine cattle and show that these variants contribute substantially to gene expression and splicing variation.",

Recently, we developed a mouse model of the variant SCN2A-p.K1422E that was maintained as an isogenic line on the C57BL/6J (B6) strain. Our initial characterization of NDD phenotypes in heterozygous Scn2aK1422E mice revealed alterations in anxiety-related behavior and seizure susceptibility. To determine if background strain affects phenotype severity in the Scn2aK1422E mouse model, phenotypes of mice on B6 and [DBA/2JxB6]F1 hybrid (F1D2) strains were compared.\n\nConvergent evidence from neurobehavioral assays demonstrated lower anxiety-like behavior in Scn2aK1422E mice compared to wild-type and further suggested that this effect is more pronounced on the B6 background compared to the F1D2 background. Although there were no strain-dependent differences in occurrence of rare spontaneous seizures, response to the chemoconvulsant kainic acid revealed differences in seizure generalization and lethality risk, with variation based on strain and sex. Continued examination of strain-dependent effects in the Scn2aK1422E mouse model could reveal genetic backgrounds with unique susceptibility profiles that would be relevant for future studies on specific traits and enable the identification of highly penetrant phenotypes and modifier genes that could provide clues about the primary pathogenic mechanism of the K1422E variant.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for biomarkers important for clinical phenotypes can lead to clinically relevant discoveries. GWAS for quantitative traits are based on simplified regression models modeling the conditional mean of a phenotype as a linear function of genotype. An alternative and easy to apply approach is quantile regression that naturally extends linear regression to the analysis of the entire conditional distribution of a phenotype of interest by modeling conditional quantiles within a regression framework. Quantile regression can be applied efficiently at biobank scale using standard statistical packages in much the same way as linear regression, while having some unique advantages such as identifying variants with heterogeneous effects across different quantiles, including non-additive effects and variants involved in gene-environment interactions; accommodating a wide range of phenotype distributions with invariance to trait transformation; and overall providing more detailed information about the underlying genotype-phenotype associations. Here, we demonstrate the value of quantile regression in the context of GWAS by applying it to 39 quantitative traits in the UK Biobank (n > 300, 000 individuals). Across these 39 traits we identify 7,297 significant loci, including 259 loci only detected by quantile regression. We show that quantile regression can help uncover replicable but unmodelled gene-environment interactions, and can provide additional key insights into poorly understood genotype-phenotype correlations for clinically relevant biomarkers at minimal additional cost.",

    "abstract": "The dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) has long been held to act as a basic relay for visual information travelling from the retina to cortical areas, but recent findings suggest a largely underestimated functional plasticity of dLGN neurons. However, the cellular mechanisms supporting this functional plasticity have not been yet explored. In particular, it remains to elucidate whether intrinsic neuronal excitability change upon visual stimuli. We show here that monocular deprivation for 10 days reduces the intrinsic excitability of dorsal LGN relay cells. Furthermore, dLGN neurons exhibit long-term potentiation of their intrinsic excitability (LTP-IE) when suprathreshold afferent retinal inputs are stimulated at 40 Hz or when spikes are induced with direct somatic current injection to reproduce patterns of retinal activity. LTP-IE is observed after eye opening and requires calcium influx mediated by L-type calcium channels. It involves activation of PKA and is expressed through the down-regulation of Kv1 potassium channels. In conclusion, our study provides the first evidence for intrinsic plasticity in dLGN relay cells, thus further pointing the role of thalamic neurons in activity-dependent visual plasticity and amblyopia.",

    "abstract": "Hearing involves analyzing the physical attributes of sounds and integrating the results of this analysis with other sensory, cognitive and motor variables in order to guide adaptive behavior. The auditory cortex is considered crucial for the integration of acoustic and contextual information and is thought to share the resulting representations with subcortical auditory structures via its vast descending projections. By imaging cellular activity in the corticorecipient shell of the inferior colliculus of mice engaged in a sound detection task, we show that the majority of neurons encode information beyond the physical attributes of the stimulus and that the animals behavior can be decoded from the activity of those neurons with a high degree of accuracy. Surprisingly, this was also the case in mice in which auditory cortical input to the midbrain had been removed by bilateral cortical lesions. This illustrates that subcortical auditory structures have access to a wealth of non-acoustic information and can, independently of the auditory cortex, carry much richer neural representations than previously thought.",

Herein, we provide a single nuclei atlas of PAD limb muscle to facilitate a better understanding of the composition of cells and transcriptional differences that comprise the diseased limb muscle.\n\nMethodsWe obtained gastrocnemius muscle specimens from 20 PAD patients and 12 non-PAD controls. Nuclei were isolated and single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) was performed. The composition of nuclei was characterized by iteraOve clustering via principal component analysis, differenOal expression analysis, and the use of known marker genes. BioinformaOcs analysis was performed to determine differences in gene expression between PAD and non-PAD nuclei, as well as subsequent analysis of intercellular signaling networks. Additional histological analyses of muscle specimens accompany the snRNAseq atlas.\n\nResultssnRNAseq analysis indicated a fiber type shim with PAD paOents having fewer Type I (slow/oxidaOve) and more Type II (fast/glycolyOc) myonuclei compared to non-PAD, which was confirmed using immunostaining of muscle specimens. Myonuclei from PAD displayed global upregulation of genes involved in stress response, autophagy, hypoxia, and atrophy. Subclustering of myonuclei also idenOfied populations that were unique to PAD muscle characterized by metabolic dysregulation. PAD muscles also displayed unique transcriptional profiles and increased diversity of transcriptomes in muscle stem cells, regeneraOng myonuclei, and fibro-adipogenic progenitor (FAPs) cells. Analysis of intercellular communication networks revealed FAPs as a major signaling hub in PAD muscle, as well as deficiencies in angiogenic and bone morphogeneOc protein signaling which may contribute to poor limb function in PAD.\n\nConclusionsThis reference snRNAseq atlas provides a comprehensive analysis of the cell composition, transcriptional signature, and intercellular communication pathways that are altered in the PAD condition.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOptic neuropathy (ON) is a major cause of irreversible blindness, yet the molecular determinants that contribute to neuronal demise have not been fully elucidated. Several studies have identified  ephrin signaling as one of the most dysregulated pathways in the early pathophysiology of ON with varied etiologies. Developmentally, gradients in ephrin signaling coordinate retinotopic mapping via repulsive modulation of cytoskeletal dynamics in neuronal membranes. Little is known about the role ephrin signaling played in the post-natal visual system and its correlation with the onset of optic neuropathy.\n\nMethodsPostnatal mouse retinas were collected for mass spectrometry analysis for Eph receptors. Optic nerve crush (ONC) model was employed to induce optic neuropathy, and proteomic changes during the acute phase of neuropathic onset were analyzed. Confocal and super-resolution microscopy determined the cellular localization of activated Eph receptors after ONC injury. Eph receptor inhibitors assessed the neuroprotective effect of ephrin signaling modulation.\n\nResultsMass spectrometry revealed expression of seven Eph receptors (EphA2, A4, A5, B1, B2, B3, and B6) in postnatal mouse retinal tissue. Immunoblotting analysis indicated a significant increase in phosphorylation of these Eph receptors 48 hours after ONC. Confocal microscopy demonstrated the presence of both subclasses of Eph receptors in the inner retinal layers. STORM super-resolution imaging combined with optimal transport colocalization analysis revealed a significant co-localization of activated Eph receptors with injured neuronal processes, compared to uninjured neuronal and/or injured glial cells, 48 hours post-ONC. Eph receptor inhibitors displayed notable neuroprotective effects after 6 days of ONC injury.\n\nConclusionsOur findings demonstrate the functional presence of diverse Eph receptors in the postnatal mammalian retina, capable of modulating multiple biological processes. Pan-Eph receptor activation contributes to the onset of neuropathy in ONs, with preferential activation of Eph receptors on neuronal processes in the inner retina following optic nerve injury. Notably, Eph receptor activation precedes neuronal loss. We observed neuroprotective effects upon inhibiting Eph receptors. Our study highlights the importance of investigating this repulsive pathway in early optic neuropathies and provides a comprehensive characterization of the receptors present in the developed retina of mice, relevant to both homeostasis and disease processes.",

    "abstract": "The zinc transporter Slc30a1 plays an essential role in maintaining cellular zinc homeostasis; however, its functional role in macrophages remains largely unknown. Here, we systematically examined the expression and function of Slc30a1 in macrophages upon Salmonella infection in both Slc30a1 reporter mice and in macrophage-specific Slc30a1 knockout (Slc30a1fl/flLysMCre) mice. We found that Slc30a1fl/flLysMCremice have an increased susceptibility to Salmonella infection compared to control littermates. Mechanistically, we found that loss of Slc30a1 in macrophages reduced their bactericidal activity via reduced iNOS and NO production due to intracellular zinc accumulation. In addition, we observed significantly increased expression of Mt1 (metallothionein 1) in Salmonella-infected Slc30a1-deficient macrophages, suggesting that Mt1 may serve as a compensatory zinc reservoir. Interestingly, macrophages lacking both Mt1 and Slc30a1 expression (Slc30a1fl/flLysMCre; Mt1-/-) had increased cell death upon Salmonella infection due to excess zinc-induced oxidative stress. Taken together, our results show that Slc30a1 in macrophages can protect against Salmonella infection, providing mechanistic insights into the role of Slc30a1-mediated zinc homeostasis in macrophages in response to infectious disease.",

We report that the V{gamma}9+V{delta}2+ T cells efficiently purge such cultures from infected cells. This effector function requires the expression of members of the BTN3A family on epithelial cells. Specifically, the BTN3A1 and BTN3A3 are redundant in their ability to present antigen to V{gamma}9+V{delta}2+ T cells.

    "abstract": "Background: Natural killer (NK) cell-based immunotherapies, currently under investigation, appear to be safe, efficient treatments in patients with haematological tumours. Nevertheless, the short-lived nature of these cells combined with the need to infuse large number of cells for efficient tumour elimination represent important challenges for the development of NK cell-based therapies. Although NK cell anti-tumour activity is regulated by cytokines, constant stimulation together with the immunosuppressive tumour environment can result in NK cell exhaustion. Therefore, improved approaches to produce highly cytotoxic and longer-lived NK cells are of considerable clinical interest.\n\nMethods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are primed in vitro with a pulse of either Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine or a cell wall extract of M. bovis, followed by weekly stimulations with low doses of IL12, 15 and 21. The phenotype and anti-tumour fitness of the activated NK cell culture were examined using scRNA-seq, flow cytometry and functional assays, including degranulation, specific cytotoxicity and IFN{gamma} release.\n\nResults: we describe a novel strategy for the generation of long-lived activated NK cells capable of killing a broad range of solid tumours. A unique subset of cytotoxic NK cells (CD56high CD16+ NKG2A+) specifically proliferated in vitro, and was further expanded without functional exhaustion under minimal survival cytokine combinations. Mycobacterial cell-wall fractions also activated NK cells that recognised tumours efficiently, and proliferated well, and this approach has the advantage that no live bacteria are present in the cultures.\n\nConclusions: We propose that BCG-priming to expand anti-tumour NK cells, without cell sorting, could be a scalable and economical basis for the development of safe and universal cellular immunotherapies against solid tumours.\n\nKey messagesAdoptive therapy with sorted NK cells grown in IL12, 15, 18 are being tested in clinical trials, but are only efficient for haematological tumours. In addition, their survival in vivo is limited. Here, we define culture conditions that drive the selective proliferation of long-lived natural killer (NK) cells, without the need of cell sorting, in minimal doses of cytokines, after priming with BCG or mycobacteria components. BCG-primed NK cells grow and maintain effective cytotoxic function against a variety of solid tumours in vitro, without exhaustion for at least 28 days of culture. This new approach provides the basis for the generation of innate adoptive cell therapy tools.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCD3 bispecific antibodies (CD3-bsAbs) require binding of both a tumor-associated surface antigen and CD3 for their immunotherapeutic effect. Their efficacy is, therefore, influenced by the absolute tumor uptake and the extracellular dose. To optimize their currently limited efficacy in solid tumors, increased understanding of their pharmacokinetics and in vivo internalization is needed.\n\nMethodsHere were studied the pharmacokinetics and in vivo internalization of CD3xTRP1, a fully murine Fc-inert bsAb, in endogenous TRP1-expressing immunocompetent male C57BL/6J mice bearing TRP1-positive and negative tumors over time. Matching bsAbs lacking TRP1- or CD3-binding capacity served as controls. BsAbs were radiolabeled with 111In to investigate their pharmacokinetics, target binding, and biodistribution through SPECT/CT imaging and ex vivo biodistribution analyses. Co-injection of 111In- and 125I-labeled bsAb was performed to investigate the in vivo internalization by comparing tissue concentrations of cellular residing 111In versus effluxing 125I. Anti-tumor therapy effects were evaluated by monitoring tumor growth and immunohistochemistry.\n\nResultsSPECT/CT and biodistribution analyses showed that CD3xTRP1 specifically targeted TRP1-positive tumors and CD3-rich lymphoid organ and uptake peaked 24 hours pi (KPC3-TRP1: 37.7{+/-}5.3 %ID/g, spleen: 29.0{+/-}3.9 %ID/g). Studies with control bsAbs demonstrated that uptake of CD3xTRP1 in TRP1-positive tumors and CD3-rich tissues was primarily receptor-mediated. Together with CD3xTRP1 in the circulation being mainly unattached, this indicates that CD3+ T cells are generally not traffickers of CD3-bsAbs to the tumor. Additionally, \"antigen-sink\" effects by TRP1-expressing melanocytes were not observed. We further demonstrated rapid internalization of CD3xTRP1 in KPC3-TRP1 tumors (24h pi: 54.9{+/-}2.3% internalized) and CD3-rich tissues (spleen, 24h pi: 79.7{+/-}0.9% internalized). Therapeutic effects by CD3xTRP1 were observed for TRP1-positive tumors and consisted of high tumor influx of CD8+ T cells and neutrophils, which corresponded with increased necrosis and growth delay.\n\nConclusionsWe show that CD3xTRP1 efficiently targets TRP1-positive tumors and CD3-rich tissues primarily through receptor-mediated targeting. We further demonstrate rapid receptor-mediated internalization of CD3xTRP1 in TRP1-positive tumors and CD3-rich tissues. Even though this significantly decreases the therapeutical available dose, CD3xTRP1 still induced effective anti-tumor T-cell responses and inhibited tumor growth.

Neutropenic patients are at high risk for fungal and bacterial infections and can benefit from granulocyte transfusion therapy. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) could provide a robust source of neutrophil-like cells for infusion as they can be generated in large quantities and do not require a donor. However, dampened intracellular signaling limits their cellular activation and response. Here, we show that we can engineer iPSC-derived neutrophils (iNeutrophils) for enhanced motility and anti-microbial functions. Deletion of the PTP1B phosphatase increased iNeutrophil PI3K and ERK signaling and was associated with increased F-actin polymerization, cell migration and phagocytosis. PTP1B deletion also increased production of inflammatory cytokines, including the neutrophil chemoattractant IL-8. Furthermore, PTP1B-KO iNeutrophils displayed a highly activated morphology and were more responsive to the fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. KO iNeutrophils efficiently migrated to and swarmed hyphae resulting in inhibition of fungal growth.

    "abstract": "Autoimmune diseases of the central nervous system such as multiple sclerosis (MS) are only partially represented in current experimental models and the development of humanized immune mice is crucial for better understanding of immunopathogenesis and testing of novel therapeutics. We describe a humanized mouse model with several key MS features. Severely immunodeficient B2m-NOG mice were transplanted with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from MS and healthy (HI) donors and showed rapid engraftment by human T and B lymphocytes. DR13-positive MS PBMC mice developed low levels of graft versus host disease (GVHD) and no CNS inflammation. Both DR15 MS and DR15 HI mice developed spontaneous and EAE-inducible infiltration of CNS barriers and parenchyma by CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. DR15 MS mice uniquely developed spontaneous T cell lesions in brainstem and spinal cord grey matter, and large EAE-inducible lesions in the brain corpus callosum, with relatively low GVHD levels compared to DR15 HI mice. Main limitations of this model for further development are poor monocyte engraftment, lack of demyelination and of lymph node organization and IgG responses. These results show that PBMC humanized mice represent promising experimental tools for MS immunopathology and for testing experimental immunotherapeutics in a patient-specific approach.",

Our results show that A. sinensis is a complex autooctoploid species containing four kinds of octovalents (8 n), a hexavalent (6 n), two tetravalents (4 n), and a divalent (2 n). We propose based on an analysis taking into account delayed rediploidization that its octoploid genome composition results from two rounds of homologous whole genome duplications (WGDs), and further provide insight into the timing of its ploidy evolution.

    "abstract": "Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) is a mosquito-borne disease in the family Flaviviridae. We have previously shown that DENV-2 can infect C6/36 mosquito cells and cause initial cytopathic effects that dissipate upon serial split-passage to yield persistently infected cultures with normal growth and morphology. In other words, the cell line accommodated persistent DENV-2 infections. It has recently been found that insect viral infections induce production of viral copy DNA (vcDNA) fragments via host reverse transcriptase (RT). The vcDNA occurs in both linear (lvcDNA) and circular (cvcDNA) forms and produces small interfering RNA (siRNA) transcripts that can result in an immediate protective RNA interference (RNAi) response. The vcDNA can also result in host acquisition of endogenous viral elements (EVE) in genomic DNA. Thus, we hypothesized that DENV-2 cvcDNA and DENV-2-EVE would arise in C6/36 insect cells challenged with DENV-2 virus in vitro. Here we describe the successful isolation and characterization of cvcDNA constructs homologous to DENV-2 from laboratory challenges with C6/36 cells. At least 1 of these appeared to arise from a DENV-2-EVE. We also show that a linear vcDNA preparation derived from the DENV-2-EVE sequence by PCR significantly reduced DENV-2 replication when applied to naive C6/36 cells prior to DENV-2 challenge. This is preliminary work designed to lay the groundwork for further studies on use of the C6/36 cell model for screening and characterization of protective EVE against both insect and shrimp viruses.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCellular identity is determined partly by cell type-specific epigenomic profiles that regulate gene expression. In neuroscience, there is a pressing need to isolate and characterize the epigenomes of specific CNS cell types in health and disease. This is especially true as for DNA modifications where most data are derived from bisulfite sequencing that cannot differentiate between DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation. In this study, we developed an in vivo tagging mouse model (Camk2a-NuTRAP) for paired isolation of neuronal DNA and RNA without cell sorting and then used this model to assess epigenomic regulation of gene expression between neurons and glia.\n\nResultsAfter validating the cell-specificity of the Camk2a-NuTRAP model, we performed TRAP-RNA-Seq and INTACT whole genome oxidative bisulfite sequencing to assess the neuronal translatome and epigenome in the hippocampus of young mice (3 months old). These data were then compared to microglial and astrocytic data from NuTRAP models. When comparing the different cell types, microglia had the highest global mCG levels followed by astrocytes and then neurons, with the opposite pattern observed for hmCG and mCH. Differentially modified regions between cell types were predominantly found within gene bodies and distal intergenic regions, with limited differences occurring within proximal promoters. Across cell types there was a negative correlation between DNA modifications (mCG, mCH, hmCG) and gene expression at proximal promoters. In contrast, a negative correlation of mCG with gene expression within the gene body while a positive relationship between distal promoter and gene body hmCG and gene expression was observed. Furthermore, we identified a neuron-specific inverse relationship between mCH and gene expression across promoter and gene body regions.\n\nConclusionsIn this study, we identified differential usage of DNA modifications across CNS cell types, and assessed the relationship between DNA modifications and gene expression in neurons and glia. Despite having different global levels, the general modification-gene expression relationship was conserved across cell types. The enrichment of differential modifications in gene bodies and distal regulatory elements, but not proximal promoters, across cell types highlights epigenomic patterning in these regions as potentially greater determinants of cell identity.",

    "abstract": "Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a life-threatening infection caused by species in the ubiquitous fungal genus Aspergillus. While leukocyte-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) are critical for the clearance of fungal conidia from the lung and resistance to IPA, the processes that govern ROS-dependent fungal cell death remain poorly defined. Using a flow cytometric approach that monitors two independent cell death markers, an endogenous histone H2A:mRFP nuclear integrity reporter and Sytox Blue cell impermeable (live/dead) stain, we observed that loss of A. fumigatus cytochrome c (cycA) results in reduced susceptibility to cell death from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment. Consistent with these observations in vitro, loss of cycA confers resistance to both NADPH-oxidase -dependent and -independent killing by host leukocytes. Fungal ROS resistance is partly mediated in part by Bir1, a homolog to survivin in humans, as Bir1 overexpression results in decreased ROS-induced conidial cell death and reduced killing by innate immune cells in vivo. We further report that overexpression of the Bir1 N-terminal BIR domain in A. fumigatus conidia results in altered expression of metabolic genes that functionally converge on mitochondrial function and cytochrome c (cycA) activity. Together, these studies demonstrate that cycA in A. fumigatus contributes to cell death responses that are induced by exogenous H2O2 and by host leukocytes.\n\nImportanceAspergillus fumigatus can cause a life-threatening infection known as invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), which is marked by fungus-attributable mortality rates of 20%-30%. Individuals at risk of IPA harbor genetic mutations or incur pharmacologic defects that impair myeloid cell numbers and/or function, exemplified by bone marrow transplant recipients, patients that receive corticosteroid therapy, or patients with Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD). However, treatments for Aspergillus infections remains limited, and resistance to the few existing drug classes is emerging. Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) classified A. fumigatus as a critical priority fungal pathogen. Our research identifies an important aspect of fungal biology that impacts susceptibility to leukocyte killing. Furthering our understanding of mechanisms that mediate the outcome of fungal-leukocyte interactions will increase our understanding of both the underlying fungal biology governing cell death and innate immune evasion strategies utilized during mammalian infection pathogenesis. Consequently, our studies are a critical step toward leveraging these mechanisms for novel therapeutic advances.",

    "abstract": "Critical stages of lytic Herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) replication are marked by the sequential expression of immediate early (IE) to early (E), then late (L) viral genes. HSV-1 also persists in neuronal tissues via a non-replicative, transcriptionally repressed infection called latency. Understanding the regulation of lytic and latent transcriptional profiles provides focused insight into HSV-1 infection and disease. We sought a fluorescence-based approach to observe temporal progression of HSV-1 infection at the single-cell level. We constructed and characterized a novel HSV-1 recombinant that reports IE and L gene expression by fluorescent protein detection. The dual-reporter HSV-1 visualizes IE gene expression by a CMV promotor-driven YFP, and L gene expression by an endogenous mCherry-VP26 fusion. We confirmed that viral gene expression, replication and spread of infection in epithelial cells is not altered by the incorporation of the fluorescent reporters. Interference with viral DNA polymerase activity abolishes VP26-mCherry detection late in HSV-1 infection, visually reporting the failure to complete viral replication. Viral replication in primary neurons is not altered, but retrograde-directed inoculation of the dual-reporter HSV-1 exhibits a modest reduction in titer, compared to unlabeled HSV-1. Low-dose axonal inoculation in the presence of small molecule modulation of neuronal signaling results in divergent outcomes of YFP and mCherry detection, suggesting different states of latent and lytic replication. Rigorous characterization of this dual-reporter HSV-1 recombinant has demonstrated the utility of temporal observation of HSV-1 replication in live cells and the potential for further insight into the dynamics of infection.\n\nImportanceHerpes simplex virus-type 1 (HSV-1) is a prevalent human pathogen that infects approximately 67% of the global population. HSV-1 invades the peripheral nervous system, where latent HSV-1 infection persists within the host for life. Immunological evasion, viral persistence, and herpetic pathologies are determined by regulation of HSV-1 gene expression. Studying HSV-1 gene expression during neuronal infection is challenging but essential for the development of antiviral therapeutics and interventions. We constructed and characterized a dual-fluorescent HSV-1 recombinant that enables visualization of IE and L gene expression. The recombinant HSV-1 is used to observe the progression and outcome of infection. We demonstrate that drug treatments targeting cellular pathways can manipulate latent HSV-1 infection in neurons to achieve divergent outcomes of infection.",

The Anatolian wild ass whole genome profiles fall outside the genomic diversity of other extant and past Asiatic wild ass (E.hemionus) lineages. These observations strongly suggest that the three Anatolian wild asses represent E.hydruntinus, making them the latest recorded survivors of this lineage, about a millennium later than the latest observations in the zooarchaeological record. Comparative genomic analyses suggest that E.hydruntinus was a sister clade to all ancient and present-day E.hemionus lineages, representing an early split. We also find indication of gene flow between hydruntines and Middle Eastern wild asses. Analyses of genome-wide heterozygosity and runs of homozygosity reveal that the Anatolian wild ass population had severely lost genetic diversity by the mid-1st millennium BCE, a likely omen of its eventual demise.",

    "abstract": "Ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) are widespread and highly abundant in nature. Despite their typical aerobic metabolism, they can be abundant in ecosystems where oxygen is scarce. Recent observations revealed that the AOA isolate Nitrosopumilus maritimus produces oxygen and dinitrogen at nanomolar concentrations, upon oxygen depletion through nitric oxide (NO) dismutation. Here, we explore NO dismutation capability in other ammonia oxidizers with different phylogenetic affinities and from different environmental settings. The organisms explored include three marine AOA, one soil AOA and two soil ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). Upon oxygen depletion all isolates accumulated oxygen. In incubations with 15N tracers with ongoing oxygen accumulation, the AOA strains Nitrosopumilus adriaticus and Nitrosopumilus viennensis produced 46N2O from nitrite. Transient 46N2O accumulation followed by 30N2 production was detected in the AOA strains Nitrosopumilus piranensis and Nitrosopumilus sp. CCS1, supporting the earlier observation that NO-dismutation is a common metabolism in AOA, albeit with physiological variations between different strains. An important physiological variable is the capability to reduce N2O to N2. The finding of oxygen production in several AOA, as well as AOB, indicates that this process is widely distributed among the tree of life and adds an explanation for their abundance in oxygen-depleted environments.",

    "abstract": "Oncogenic Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) consists of latent and lytic replication phases, both of which are important for the development of KSHV- related cancers. As one of the most abundant RNA modifications, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and its related complexes regulate KSHV life cycle. However, the role of METTL16, a new RNA methyltransferase, in KSHV life cycle remains unknown. In this study, we have identified a suppressive role of METTL16 in KSHV lytic replication. METTL16 knockdown increased while METTL16 overexpression reduced KSHV lytic replication. METTL16 binding to and writing of m6A on MAT2A transcript are essential for its splicing, maturation and expression. As a rate-limiting enzyme in the methionine- S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) cycle, MAT2A catalyzes the conversion of L-methionine to SAM required for the transmethylation of protein, DNA and RNA, transamination of polyamines, and transsulfuration of cystathionine. Consequently, knockdown or chemical inhibition of MAT2A reduced intracellular SAM level and enhanced KSHV lytic replication. In contrast, SAM treatment was sufficient to inhibit KSHV lytic replication and reverse the effect of the enhanced KSHV lytic program caused by METTL16 or MAT2A knockdown. Mechanistically, METTL16 or MAT2A knockdown increased while SAM treatment decreased the intracellular reactive oxygen species level by altering glutathione level, which is essential for efficient KSHV lytic replication. These findings demonstrate that METTL16 suppresses KSHV lytic replication by modulating the SAM cycle to maintain intracellular SAM level and redox homeostasis, thus illustrating the linkage of KSHV life cycle with specific m6A modifications, and cellular metabolic and oxidative conditions.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) causes pneumonia that kills millions through acute toxicity and invasion of the lung parenchyma. During aerobic respiration, Spn releases hydrogen peroxide (Spn-H2O2), as a by-product of enzymes SpxB and LctO, and causes cell death with signs of both apoptosis and pyroptosis by oxidizing unknown cell targets. Hemoproteins are molecules essential for life and prone to oxidation by H2O2. We recently demonstrated that during infection-mimicking conditions, Spn-H2O2 oxidizes the hemoprotein hemoglobin (Hb), releasing toxic heme. In this study, we investigated details of the molecular mechanism(s) by which the oxidation of hemoproteins by Spn-H2O2 causes human lung cell death. Spn strains, but not H2O2-deficient Spn{Delta}spxB{Delta}lctO strains caused time-dependent cell cytotoxicity characterized by the rearrangement of the actin, the loss of the microtubule cytoskeleton and nuclear contraction. Disruption of the cell cytoskeleton correlated with the presence of invasive pneumococci and an increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species. In cell culture, the oxidation of Hb or cytochrome c (Cytc) caused DNA degradation and mitochondrial dysfunction from inhibition of complex I-driven respiration, which was cytotoxic to human alveolar cells. Oxidation of hemoproteins resulted in the creation of a radical, which was identified as a protein derived side chain tyrosyl radical by using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Thus, we demonstrate that Spn invades lung cells, releasing H2O2 that oxidizes hemoproteins, including Cytc, catalyzing the formation of a tyrosyl side chain radical on Hb and causing mitochondrial disruption, that ultimately leads to the collapse of the cell cytoskeleton.",

    "abstract": "A significant part of the human genome consists of endogenous retroviruses sequences. Human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) is the most recently acquired endogenous retrovirus, is activated and expressed in many cancers and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and possibly contributes to the aging process. To understand the molecular architecture of endogenous retroviruses, we determined the structure of immature HERV-K from native virus-like particles (VLPs) using cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging (cryoET STA). The HERV-K VLPs show a greater distance between the viral membrane and immature capsid lattice, correlating with the presence of additional peptides, SP1 and p15, between the capsid (CA) and matrix (MA) proteins compared to the other retroviruses. The resulting cryoET STA map of the immature HERV-K capsid at 3.2 [A] resolution shows a hexamer unit oligomerized through a 6-helix bundle which is further stabilized by a small molecule in the same way as the IP6 in immature HIV-1 capsid. The HERV-K immature CA hexamer assembles into the immature lattice via highly conserved dimmer and trimer interfaces, whose interactions were further detailed through all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and supported by mutational studies. A large conformational change mediated by the flexible linker between the N-terminal and the C-terminal domains of CA occurs between the immature and the mature HERV-K capsid protein, analogous to HIV-1. Comparison between HERV-K and other retroviral immature capsid structures reveals a highly conserved mechanism for the assembly and maturation of retroviruses across genera and evolutionary time.",

    "abstract": "Latent HIV-1 provirus represents a barrier towards a cure for infection, but is dependent upon the host RNA Pol II machinery for expression. We find that inhibitors of the RNA Pol II mediator kinases CDK8/19, Senexin A and BRD6989, inhibit induction of HIV-1 expression in response to latency reversing agents and T cell signaling agonists. These inhibitors were found to impair recruitment of RNA Pol II to HIV-1 LTR. HIV-1 expression in response to several latency reversal agents was impaired upon disruption of CDK8 by shRNA or gene knockout. However, the effects of CDK8 depletion did not entirely mimic CDK8/19 kinase inhibition suggesting that the mediator kinases are not functionally redundant. Furthermore, treatment of CD4+ PBMCs isolated from people living with HIV-1 and who are receiving ART with Senexin A inhibited induction of virus replication in response to T cell stimulation by PMA and ionomycin. These observations indicate that the mediator kinases CDK8 and CDK19, play a significant role for regulation of HIV-1 transcription, and that small molecule inhibitors of these enzymes may contribute to therapies designed to promote deep latency involving the durable suppression of provirus expression.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) is the causative agent of Johnes Disease, a chronic granulomatous enteritis of ruminants. MAP establishes an infection in the host via the small intestine. This requires the bacteria to adhere to and be internalised by cells of the intestinal tract. The effector molecules expressed by MAP for this remain to be fully identified and understood. The mammalian cell entry (Mce) proteins play an essential role for other Mycobacterial species to facilitate the attachment and invasion of host epithelial cells. Here, we have expressed Mce1A, Mce1D, Mce3C and Mce4A proteins derived from MAP on the surface of a non-invasive E. coli host to characterise their role in the initial interaction between MAP and the host. To this end, mce1A was found to significantly increase the ability of the E. coli to attach and survive intracellularly in THP-1 cells, and mce1D was found to significantly increase attachment and invasion of MDBK cells. Both genes were implicated in the increased ability of E. coli to infect 3D bovine basal-out enteroids. Together, these results have identified two effector molecules used by MAP with a degree of cell-type specificity.",

Typhi Type 3 secretion systems (T3SSs) encoded on Salmonella Pathogenicity Islands (SPI) -1 (T3SS-1) and -2 (T3SS-2) during human macrophage infection. We found that mutants of S. Typhi deficient for both T3SSs were defective for intramacrophage replication as measured by flow cytometry, viable bacterial counts, and live time-lapse microscopy. T3SS-secreted proteins PipB2 and SifA contributed to S. Typhi replication and were translocated into the cytosol of human macrophages through both T3SS-1 and -2, demonstrating functional redundancy for these secretion systems. Importantly, an S. Typhi mutant strain that is deficient for both T3SS-1 and -2 was severely attenuated in the ability to colonize systemic tissues in a humanized mouse model of typhoid fever. Overall, this study establishes a critical role for S. Typhi T3SSs during its replication within human macrophages and during systemic infection of humanized mice.\n\nImportanceSalmonella enterica serovar Typhi is a human-restricted pathogen that causes typhoid fever. Understanding the key virulence mechanisms that facilitate S. Typhi replication in human phagocytes will enable rational vaccine and antibiotic development to limit spread of this pathogen. While S. Typhimurium replication in murine models has been studied extensively, there is limited information available about S. Typhi replication in human macrophages, some of which directly conflicts with findings from S. Typhimurium murine models. This study establishes that both of S.

We found that the marine model bacterium Phaeobacter inhibens achieves shorter lag times in the presence of nano-to micromolar concentrations of N-or S-methylated compounds, which are abundantly produced by microalgae. To understand the underlying mechanism, we studied algal-bacterial co-cultures and bacterial pure cultures during their lag phase using transcriptomics analyses, 13C-labeled metabolomics, gene knock-out experiments and enzymatic characterizations.

    "abstract": "Despite the fact that Cladosporium sp. are ubiquitous fungi, their viromes have been little studied. By analysing a collection of Cladosporium fungi, two new partitiviruses named Cladosporium cladosporioides partitivirus 1 (CcPV1) and Cladosporium cladosporioides partitivirus 2 (CcPV2) co-infecting a strain of Cladosporium cladosporioides were identified. Their complete genome consists in two monocistronic dsRNA segments (RNA1 and RNA2) with a high percentage of pairwise identity on 5 and 3 end. The RNA dependant RNA polymerase (RdRp) of both viruses and the capsid protein (CP) of CcPV1 display the classic characteristics required for their assignment to the Gammapartitivirus genus. In contrast, CcPV2 RNA2 encodes for a 41 KDa CP that is unusually small with a low percentage of amino acid identity as compared to CPs of other viruses classified in this genus. This sequence was used to annotate fifteen similar viral sequences with unconfirmed function. The phylogeny of the CP was highly consistent with the phylogeny of their corresponding RdRp, supporting the organization of gammapartitiviruses into three distinct clades despite stretching the current demarcation criteria.",

    "abstract": "We provide an overview of a protein, IEE (Insertion Sequence Excision Enhancer), which was originally observed to facilitate high levels of excision of the IS3 family member, IS629, from clinically important Escherichia coli O157:H7. IEE was subsequently shown to affect a large class of bacterial insertion sequences which all transpose by producing a circular intermediate and presumably use the copy-out-paste-in transposition mechanism. Excision is dependent on both IEE and transposase indicating that it is associated with the transposition process itself. We propose that IEE serves to immobilize genes carried by compound transposons by removing the flanking IS copies, an activity which would explain the presence of certain of these genes without associated IS copies in plasmids and chromosomes. The biochemical activities of IEE as a primase with the capacity to recognize microhomologies, together with the observation that its effect appears to be restricted to those IS families which probably use the copy-out-paste-in transposition pathway, suggests a strand switch mechanism during the copy-out step leading to abortive transposition. This reinforces the proposal made for understanding the loss of the IS30 family member, ISApl1, which flanks the mcr-1 gene in the compound transposon Tn6330.",

    "abstract": "Winged helix (wH) domains, also termed winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) domains, are widespread in all kingdoms of life, and have diverse roles. In the context of DNA binding and DNA modification sensing, some eukaryotic wH domains are known as sensors of non-methylated CpG. In contrast, the prokaryotic wH domains in DpnI and phi.HhiV4I act as sensors of adenine methylation in 6mApT (6mA = N6mA) context. DNA binding modes and interactions with the probed dinucleotide are vastly different in the two cases. Here, we show that the role of the wH domain as a sensor of adenine methylation is widespread in prokaryotes. We present previously uncharacterized examples of PD-(D/E)XK--wH (FcyTI, Psp4BI), PUA--wH--HNH (HtuIII, Hsa13891I), wH--GIY-YIG (Ahi29725I, Apa233I) and PLD--wH (Aba4572I, CbaI) fusion endonucleases that sense adenine methylation in the Dam G6mATC, and possibly other, slightly more relaxed contexts. Representatives of the wH domain endonuclease fusion families with the exception of the PLD--wH family could be purified, and an in vitro preference for adenine methylation in the Dam context could be demonstrated. Like most other MDREs, the new fusion endonucleases except those in the PD-(D/E)XK--wH family cleave close to, but outside the recognition sequence. Taken together, our data illustrate the widespread combinatorial use of prokaryotic wH domains as adenine methylation sensors.",

The bioactive eicosanoid, prostaglandin F2, and its cognate receptor FPr (Ptfgr) are implicated as a TGF{beta}1 independent signaling hub for IPF. To assess this, we leveraged our published murine PF model (IER -SftpcI73T) expressing a disease-associated missense mutation in the surfactant protein C (Sftpc) gene. Tamoxifen treated IER -Sftpc I73T mice develop an early multiphasic alveolitis and transition to spontaneous fibrotic remodeling by 28 days. IER -Sftpc I73T mice crossed to a Ptgfr null (FPr-/-) line showed attenuated weight loss and gene dosage dependent rescue of mortality compared to FPr+/+ cohorts. IER -Sftpc I73T /FPr-/- mice also showed reductions in multiple fibrotic endpoints for which administration of nintedanib was not additive. Single cell RNA sequencing, pseudotime analysis, and in vitro assays demonstrated Ptgfr expression predominantly within adventitial fibroblasts which were reprogrammed to an \"inflammatory/transitional\" cell state in a PGF2/ FPr dependent manner. Collectively, the findings provide evidence for a role for PGF2 signaling in IPF, mechanistically identify a susceptible fibroblast subpopulation, and establish a benchmark effect size for disruption of this pathway in mitigating fibrotic lung remodeling.",

    "abstract": "Exosomopathies are a collection of rare diseases caused by mutations in genes that encode structural subunits of a ribonuclease complex termed the RNA exosome. The RNA exosome mediates both RNA processing and degradation of multiple classes of RNA. This complex is evolutionarily conserved and required for fundamental cellular functions, including rRNA processing. Recently, missense mutations in genes encoding structural subunits of the RNA exosome complex have been linked to a variety of distinct neurological diseases, many of them childhood neuronopathies with at least some cerebellar atrophy. Understanding how these missense mutations lead to the disparate clinical presentations that have been reported for this class of diseases necessitates investigation of how these specific changes alter cell-specific RNA exosome function. Although the RNA exosome complex is routinely referred to as ubiquitously expressed, little is known about the tissue- or cell-specific expression of the RNA exosome complex or any individual subunit. Here, we leverage publicly available RNA-sequencing data to analyze RNA exosome subunit transcript levels in healthy human tissues, focusing on those tissues that are impacted in exosomopathy patients described in clinical reports. This analysis provides evidence to support the characterization of the RNA exosome as ubiquitously expressed with transcript levels for the individual subunits that vary in different tissues. However, the cerebellar hemisphere and cerebellum have high levels of nearly all RNA exosome subunit transcripts. These findings could suggest that the cerebellum has a high requirement for RNA exosome function and potentially explain why cerebellar pathology is common in RNA exosomopathies.",

    "abstract": "Following the development of high-throughput sequencers, environmental prokaryotic communities can be described by metabarcoding with genetic markers on the 16s domain. However, usual short-read sequencing encounters a limitation in phylogenetic coverage and taxonomic resolution, due to the primers choice and read length. On these critical points, nanopore sequencing, a rising technology, suitable for long-read metabarcoding, was much undervalued because of its relatively higher error rate per read. Here we compared the prokaryotic community structure in samples obtained by short-read metabarcoding on 16sV4-V5 marker (ca. 0.4kbp) analyzed by sequencing-by-synthesis (Illumina dye sequencing, MiSeq), with those obtained by nanopore long-read metabarcoding on bacterial nearly complete 16s (ca. 1.5 kbp, Oxford Nanopore, MinION, R9.2), i.e. a mock community and 52 sediment samples from two contrasted mangrove sites. Nanopore and Illumina retrieved all the bacterial genus from the mock, although both showing similar deviations from the awaited proportions. From the sediment samples, with a coverage-based rarefaction of reads and after singleton filtering, Illumina and Nanopore recorded 34.7% and 35.4% of unknown OTUs, respectively. Nanopore detected 92.2% of the 309 families detected by Illumina, 87.7% of the 448 genus, and recorded 973 additional taxa not detected by Illumina, among which 91.7% were identified to the genus rank. In spite of primer specificities and read length, probably accountable for these discrepancies, co-inertia and Procrustean tests showed that community structures were significantly similar between technologies, showing both a marked contrast between sites and a coherent sea-land orientation within sites.",
