    "abstract": "COVID-19 is associated with diverse neurological abnormalities, which predict poor outcome in patients. However, the mechanisms whereby infection-induced inflammation could affect complex neuropathologies in COVID-19 are unclear. We hypothesized that microglia, the resident immune cells of brain, are centrally involved in this process. To study this, we developed an autopsy platform allowing the integration of molecular anatomy-, protein- and mRNA data sets in post-mortem mirror blocks of brain and peripheral organ samples from COVID-19 cases. Nanoscale microscopy, single-cell RNA sequencing and analysis of inflammatory and metabolic signatures revealed distinct mechanisms of microglial dysfunction associated with cerebral SARS-CoV-2 infection. We observed focal loss of microglial P2Y12R at sites of virus-associated vascular inflammation together with dysregulated microglia-vascular-astrocyte interactions, Cx3Cr1-fractalkine axis deficits and mitochondrial failure in severely affected medullary autonomic nuclei and other brain areas. Microglial dysfunction occurs at sites of excessive synapse- and myelin phagocytosis and loss of glutamatergic terminals. While central and systemic viral load is strongly linked in individual patients, the regionally heterogenous microglial reactivity in the brain correlated with the extent of central and systemic inflammation related to IL-1 / IL-6 via virus-sensing pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and inflammasome activation pathways. Thus, SARS-CoV-2-induced central and systemic inflammation might lead to a primarily glio-vascular failure in the brain, which could be a common contributor to diverse COVID-19-related neuropathologies.",

    "abstract": "The impact of Clostridioides difficile strain diversity on the severity of intestinal infection and diarrhea remains unclear. The RT027/ST1 strain is highly prevalent and has been associated with more severe disease and increased toxin production. Previous studies using antibiotic-treated mice, however, have demonstrated that the severity of diarrhea and colonic inflammation caused by clinical RT027/ST1 C. difficile isolates cultured from different patients is isolate-specific and varies from avirulent to lethal. Herein we demonstrate that increased flagellar expression is associated with increased in vivo virulence. While sequencing the flagellar operon did not identify differences between high and low virulence isolates, high virulence was associated with strains encoding higher proportions of the phase variable flagellar switch in the ON mode. We found that the proportion of bacteria with the switch in the ON mode correlates with maximum weight loss, a readout for virulence in mice. Further analysis of flagellar switch sequences identified variant inverted repeat (IR) sequences, with 40% of isolates having lost one A or T in the IR compared to the genome of C. difficile R20291. The isolates with the R20291 IR sequence have increased virulence compared to those with variant IR (p = 3.2e-05) and these isolates have markedly reduced ability to invert the flagellar switch. Our results suggest that a restricted capacity to invert the flagellar switch during infection is associated with reduced virulence of C. difficile RT027/ST1 strains and may account for some of the inconsistent associations between C. difficile infection and disease severity in patients.\n\nIMPORTANCEC. difficile RT027/ST1 has been associated with high virulence. However, variable virulence among ST1 isolates has also been observed. Recent studies have shed light on the impacts of the gut microbiota and host immunity during Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Beyond that, determining the genetic factors of C. difficile regulating virulence is essential for a successful CDI diagnosis and treatment. Here, we report a strong association between the flexibility of the flagellar switch and the virulence of C. difficile. Specifically, the inverted repeats of the flagellar switch correlate with switch flexibility. Overall, our study explores variations in C. difficile virulence and highlights the potential of using flagellar switch inverted repeats as an easily accessible genetic trait to predict pathogen virulence.",

    "abstract": "Successful nuclear migration through constricted spaces between cells or in the extracellular matrix relies on the ability of the nucleus to deform. Little is known of how this takes place in vivo. We study confined nuclear migration in Caenorhabditis elegans larval P-cells, which is mediated by the LINC complex to pull nuclei towards the minus ends of microtubules. Null mutations of LINC component unc-84 lead to a temperature-dependent phenotype, suggesting a parallel pathway for P-cell nuclear migration. A forward genetic screen for enhancers of unc-84 identified cgef-1 (CDC-42 Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor). Knockdown of CDC-42 in the absence of the LINC complex led to a P-cell nuclear migration defect. Expression of constitutively active CDC-42 rescued nuclear migration in cgef-1; unc-84 double mutants suggesting CDC-42 functions downstream of CGEF-1. The Arp2/3 complex and non-muscle myosin II (NMY-2) were also found to function parallel to the LINC pathway. In our model, CGEF-1 activates CDC-42, induces actin polymerization through the Arp2/3 complex to deform the nucleus during nuclear migration while NMY-2 helps push the nucleus through confined spaces.",

    "abstract": "Microbiomes mediate important ecosystem functions, yet it has proven difficult to determine the relationship between microbiome composition and the rate of ecosystem functions. This challenge remains because it is difficult to manipulate microbiome composition directly, we often cannot know a priori which microbiome members influence the rate of an ecosystem function, and microbiomes can covary strongly with other drivers of ecosystem function, such as the environment. To address these challenges, we imposed artificial selection on whole soil ecosystems over multiple generations to select for microbial communities with a high rate of CH4 oxidation. This approach is potentially powerful because it is biologically \"agnostic\" in that it makes few assumptions about which taxa are important to function, and repeated passaging with fresh substrate weakens the covariance between microbes and the environment. As a response to selection, we observed a 50.7% increase in CH4 oxidation rate per passage relative to a control that experienced random selection. We estimated that 31.5% of the variation in CH4 oxidation rate in these soils can be attributed to microbiome variation (though this was not significant). We also found that selection did not enrich for known CH4 oxidizers; instead, 12 families not known to oxidize CH4, including Fimbriimonadaceae, Cytophagaceae, and Diplorickettsiaceae, were enriched by selection. This result is in contrast to the typical assumption that the rate of an ecosystem function is limited by the final step in the associated microbial pathway. Our study demonstrates that variation in microbiome composition can contribute to variation in the rate of ecosystem function independent of the environment and that this may not always be limited by the final step in a pathway. This suggests that manipulating microbiome composition directly without altering the environment could be a viable strategy for managing ecosystem functions.",

    "abstract": "Human activity is altering the environment in a rapid pace, challenging the adaptive capacities of genetic variation within animal populations. Animals also harbor extensive gut microbiomes, which play diverse roles in host health and fitness and may help expanding host capabilities. The unprecedented scale of human usage of xenobiotics and contamination with environmental toxins describes one challenge against which bacteria with their immense biochemical diversity would be useful, by increasing detoxification capacities. To explore the potential of bacteria-assisted rapid adaptation, we used Caenorhabditis elegans worms harboring a defined microbiome, and neomycin as a model toxin, harmful for the worm host and neutralized to different extents by some microbiome members. Worms raised in the presence of neomycin showed delayed development and decreased survival but were protected when colonized by neomycin-resistant members of the microbiome. Two distinct mechanisms facilitated this protection: gut enrichment driven by altered bacterial competition for the strain best capable of modifying neomycin; and host avoidance behavior, which depended on the conserved JNK homolog KGB-1, enabling preference and acquisition of neomycin-protective bacteria. We further tested the consequences of adaptation, considering that enrichment for protective strains may represent dysbiosis. We found that neomycin-adapted gut microbiomes caused increased susceptibility to infection as well as an increase in gut lipid storage, suggesting metabolic remodeling. Our proof-of-concept experiments support the feasibility of bacteria-assisted host adaptation and suggest that it may be prevalent. The results also highlight trade-offs between toxin adaptation and other traits of fitness.",

    "abstract": "The biodiversity of hydrogenases, the enzymes that oxidize and produce H2, is only just beginning to be explored. Here we use direct electrochemistry to characterize two enzymes from a subgroup of ancestral FeFe hydrogenases, defined by the presence of three adjacent cysteine residues near the active site: the third FeFe hydrogenase from Clostridium pasteurianum (CpIII) and the second from Megasphaera elsdenii (MeII). To examine the functional role of the unusual TSCCCP motif, which defines the group B2 and is replaced with TSCCP in group A hydrogenases, we also produced a CpIII variant where the supernumerary cysteine is deleted. CpIII and MeII inactivate under oxidative conditions in a manner that is distinct from all other previously characterized hydrogenases from group A. Our results suggest that the supernumerary cysteine allows the previously observed sulfide-independent formation of the Hinact state in these enzymes. We also evidence a second reversible, oxidative inactivation process. Because of their inactivation under oxidative conditions, these enzymes are inefficient H2 oxidation catalysts, but their active site itself is not tuned to make them more active in one particular direction.",

    "abstract": "Plastics are pervasive in marine ecosystems and ubiquitous in both shallow and deep oceans. Microfibers, amongst other microscopic plastics, accumulate in deep sea sediments at concentrations up to four orders of magnitude higher than in surface waters. This is at odds with the fact that most microfibers are positively buoyant; therefore, it is hypothesized that settling aggregates are vectors for downward transport of microfibers in the ocean. However, little is known about the impact of microfibers on carbon export. We formed diatom aggregates with differing concentrations of microfibers using roller tanks and observed that microfiber addition stimulated aggregate formation, but decreased their structural cohesion and caused them to break apart more readily, resulting in smaller average sizes. Incorporation of positively buoyant microfibers into settling aggregates reduced their size-specific sinking velocities proportional to the microfiber concentration. Slower sinking may extend aggregate retention time in the upper ocean, thereby increasing the time available for organic matter remineralization in the upper water column. Here, we show that microfiber concentrations typical of those in the English Channel and Atlantic Ocean decrease potential export flux by 15-50%. Present day microfiber concentrations in surface waters may therefore be substantially reducing the efficiency of the biological carbon pump relative to the pre-plastic era.",

Small-angle X-ray scattering and synchrotron radiation circular dichroism suggested a disordered conformation for the TAD.

Proline (Pro) analogues, especially C4-substituted fluoroprolines, have been widely used in protein engineering to enhance the thermodynamic stability of peptides and proteins and to investigate folding kinetics. 4-thiaproline (Thp) has been shown to bias the ring pucker of Pro, to increase the cis population percentage of model peptides in comparison to Pro, and to diminish the activation energy barrier for the cis/trans isomerization reaction. Despite its intriguing properties, Thp has been seldom incorporated into proteins. Moreover, the impact of Thp on the folding kinetics of globular proteins has never been reported. In this study, we show that upon incorporation of Thp at cisPro76 into the thioredoxin variant Trx1P the half-life of the refolding reaction decreased from [~]2 hours to [~]35 seconds. A dramatic acceleration of the refolding rate could be observed also for the protein pseudo wild-type barstar upon replacement of cisPro48 with Thp. Quantum chemical calculations revealed that the replacement of the C{gamma}H2 group by a sulfur atom in the pyrrolidine ring, lowers the barrier for cis/trans rotation due to a weakened peptide bond. The protein variants retained their thermodynamic stability upon incorporation of Thp, while the catalytic and enzymatic activities of the modified Trx1P remained unchanged. Our results show that the Pro isostere Thp might eliminate the bottleneck of the refolding reaction of proteins containing cis proline residues in the native state, independent from the local structural environment.",

Despite tremendous excitement related to extracellular vesicles-associated miRNAs as biomarkers or having therapeutic potential, the mechanism of selective packaging of miRNAs into endosomes and multivesicular bodies for subsequent extracellular export is a poorly studied area due to lack of assay system to study such processes in vitro. We have developed an in vitro assay with endosomes isolated from mammalian macrophage cells to follow miRNA packaging into endocytic organelles. The synthetic miRNAs, used in the assay, get imported inside the isolated endosomes during the in vitro reaction and become protected from RNase in a time and concentration dependent manner. The selective miRNA accumulation inside endosomes requires both ATP and GTP hydrolysis and the miRNA binding protein HuR. The HuR-miRNA complex binds and stimulates the endosomal RalA GTPase to facilitate the import of miRNAs into endosomes and their subsequent export as part of the extracellular vesicles. The endosomal targeting of miRNAs is also very much dependent on endosome maturation process that is controlled by Rab5 protein and ATP.\n\nGraphical Abstract{whitebullet} miRNAs get imported to endosomes in vitro and are become protected to RNase\n{whitebullet}Endosomal miRNA import is sequence specific and requires miRNA exporter protein HuR\n{whitebullet}HuR-miRNA complex activates RalA GTPases to complete miRNA import.\n{whitebullet}Rab5 protein and ATP hydrolysis is required for endosome maturation and miRNA import\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=149 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/546187v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@217e52org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ec6190org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f972f5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ea67a4_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Avian haemosporidians are vector-borne blood parasites, which infect a great variety of avian host species. The order Passeriformes has the highest average infection probability; nevertheless, some common species of this order have been rather poorly studied in terms of haemosporidian prevalence and diversity. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of haemosporidians in one of such species, the Eurasian Jay Garrulus glandarius (Corvidae), from a forest population in Hesse, Central Germany. All individuals were infected with at least one haemosporidian genus, i.e. an overall prevalence of 100%. The most common infection pattern was a mixed infection with Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon, whereas no Plasmodium infection was detected. Our results regarding lineage diversity combined with data from other studies indicate a rather pronounced host-specificity of Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon lineages infecting birds of the family Corvidae.",

    "abstract": "Land plants undergo indeterminate growth by the activity of meristems in both gametophyte (haploid) and sporophyte (diploid) generations1-3. In the sporophyte of the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the apical meristems are located at the shoot and root tips, in which a number of regulatory gene homologs are shared for their development, implying deep evolutionary origins4-7. However, little is known about their functional conservation with gametophytic meristems in distantly related land plants such as bryophytes8-17, even though genomic studies have revealed the subfamily-level diversity of regulatory genes is mostly conserved throughout land plants18-23. Here we show that a NAM/ATAF/CUC (NAC) domain transcription factor, JINGASA (MpJIN), acts downstream of CLV3/ESR-related (CLE) peptide signaling and controls stem cell behavior in the gametophytic shoot apical meristem of the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha. We found that MpJIN shows heterogeneous expression in space and time within the stem cell zone, associated with the loss and de novo specification of stem cell identity at the branching event. Consistent with the expression pattern, induction of MpJIN results in ectopic periclinal cell division in the stem cell zone and meristem termination. Comparative expression analysis suggests that the function of JIN/FEZ subfamily genes was shared between the shoot apical meristems in the gametophyte and sporophyte generations in early land plants but was lost in certain lineages including the flowering plant A. thaliana.",

    "abstract": "In the dairy industry bacteriophage (phage) contamination significantly impairs the production and quality of products like yogurt and cheese. To combat this issue, the strains of bacteria used as starter cultures possess mechanisms that make them resistant to phage infection, such as envelope resistance, or processes that render them immune to phage infection, such as restriction-modification and CRISPR-Cas. Lactococcus lactis, used to manufacture cheese and other dairy products, can also block the reproduction of infecting phages by abortive infection (Abi), a process in which phage-infected cells die before the phage replicate. We employ mathematical-computer simulation models and experiments with two Lactococcus lactis strains and two lytic phages to investigate the conditions under which Abi can limit the proliferation of phages in L. lactis populations and prevent the extinction of their populations by these viruses. According to our model, if Abi is almost perfect and there are no other populations of bacteria capable of supporting the replication of the L. lactis phages, Abi can protect bacterial populations from succumbing to infections with these viruses. This prediction is supported by the results of our experiment, which indicate that Abi can help protect L. lactis populations from extinction by lytic phage infections. However, our results also predict abortive infection is only one element of L. lactis defenses against phage infection. Mutant phages that can circumvent the Abi systems of these bacteria emerge. The survival of L. lactis populations then depends on the evolution of envelope mutants that are resistant to the evolved host-range phage.",

    "abstract": "Horizontal transfer of F-like plasmids by bacterial conjugation is responsible for disseminating antibiotic resistance and virulence determinants among pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae species, a growing health concern worldwide. Central to this process is the conjugative F pilus, a long extracellular filamentous polymer that extends from the surface of plasmid donor cells, allowing it to probe the environment and make contact with the recipient cell. It is well established the F pilus can retract to bring mating pair cells in tight contact before DNA transfer. However, whether DNA transfer can occur through the extended pilus has been a subject of active debate. In this study, we use live-cell microscopy to show that the F pilus can indeed serve as a conduit for the DNA during transfer between physically distant cells. Our findings enable us to propose a new model for conjugation that revises our understanding of the DNA transport mechanism and the dissemination of drug resistance in complex bacterial communities.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryPlasmid DNA passes through the F pilus during conjugational transfer between physically distant bacteria.",

GDM mice had greater GBS in utero dissemination and subsequently worse neonatal outcomes. Dual-RNA sequencing revealed differential GBS adaptation to the GDM reproductive tract, including a putative glycosyltransferase (yfhO), and altered host responses. GDM disruption of immunity included reduced uterine natural killer cell activation, impaired recruitment to placentae, and altered vaginal cytokines. Lastly, we observed distinct vaginal microbial taxa associated with GDM status and GBS invasive disease status.

    "abstract": "Type IV-A CRISPR-Cas systems are primarily encoded on plasmids and form multi-subunit ribonucleoprotein complexes with unknown biological functions. In contrast to other CRISPR-Cas types, they lack the archetypical CRISPR acquisition module and encode a DinG helicase instead of a nuclease component. Type IV-A3 systems are carried by large conjugative plasmids that often harbor multiple antibiotic-resistance genes. Although their CRISPR array contents suggest a role in inter-plasmid conflicts, this function and the underlying mechanisms have remained unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that a plasmid-encoded type IV-A3 CRISPR-Cas system co-opts the type I-E adaptation machinery from its clinical Klebsiella pneumoniae host to update its CRISPR array. Furthermore, we demonstrate that robust interference of conjugative plasmids and phages is elicited through CRISPR RNA-dependent transcriptional repression. By targeting plasmid core functions, type IV-A3 can prevent the uptake of incoming plasmids, limit their horizontal transfer, and destabilize co-residing plasmids, altogether supporting type IV-A3s involvement in plasmid competition. Collectively, our findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms and ecological function of type IV-A3 systems and have broad implications for understanding and countering the spread of antibiotic resistance in clinically relevant strains.",

    "abstract": "The coexistence of multiple bacterial species during infection can have significant impacts on pathogenesis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are opportunistic bacterial pathogens that can co-infect hosts and cause serious illness. The factors that dictate whether one species will outcompete the other or whether the two species can coexist are not fully understood. We investigated the role of surfactants in the interactions between these two species on a surface that enables P. aeruginosa to swarm. We found that P. aeruginosa swarms are repelled by colonies of clinical S. aureus isolates, creating physical separation between the two strains. This effect was abolished in mutants of S. aureus that were defective in the production of phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs), which form amyloid fibrils around wild-type colonies. We investigated the mechanism that establishes physical separation between the two species using the Imaging of Reflected Illuminated Structures (IRIS) method, which tracks the flow of the rhamnolipid surfactant layer produced by P. aeruginosa. We found that PSMs produced by S. aureus deflected the rhamnolipid surfactant layer flow, which in turn, altered the direction of P. aeruginosa swarms. These findings show that rhamnolipids mediate physical separation between P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, which enables these species to coexist in distinct microenvironments. Additionally, we found that a Bacillus subtilis surfactant and abiotic hydrophobic molecules repelled P. aeruginosa swarms through surfactant deflection. Our results suggest that surfactant interactions could have major impacts on bacteria-bacteria and bacteria-host relationships. In addition, our findings uncover a mechanism responsible for P. aeruginosa swarm development that does not rely on sensing but instead is guided largely by the flow of the surfactant layer and its boundaries.",

The activation of vUNG protected HSV-1 genomes from APOBEC1-mediated DNA editing, allowing efficient viral replication to occur. The presence of APOBEC1 markedly improved lethal encephalitis in mice infected with an HSV-1 mutant carrying a mutation in the phosphorylation site and an UNG inhibitor protected wild-type HSV-1-infected mice from lethal encephalitis. These findings re-define vUNG as an important factor that allows evasion from intrinsic anti-viral immunity mediated by APOBEC1 in the CNS, and suggest a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of fetal and critical HSV-1 encephalitis.",

    "abstract": "Listeria monocytogenes is an opportunistic food-borne bacterium that is capable of infecting humans with high rates of hospitalisation and mortality. Natural populations are genotypically and phenotypically variable, with some lineages being responsible for most human infections. The success of L. monocytogenes is linked to its capacity to persist on food and in the environment. Biofilms are an important feature that allow these bacteria to persist and infect humans, therefore, understanding the genetic basis of biofilm formation is key to understanding transmission. We sought to investigate the biofilm forming ability of L. monocytogenes by identifying genetic variation that underlies biofilm formation in natural populations using genome-wide association studies. Changes in gene expression of specific strains during biofilm formation were then investigated using RNAseq. Genetic variation associated with enhanced biofilm formation was identified in 273 genes by GWAS and differential expression in 220 genes by RNAseq. Statistical analyses show that number of overlapping genes flagged by either type of experiment is less than expected by random sampling. This is consistent with an evolutionary scenario where rapid adaptation is driven by variation in gene expression of pioneer genes, and this is followed by slower adaptation driven by nucleotide changes within the core genome.\n\nImpact statementListeria monocytogenes is a problematic food-borne bacterium that can cause severe illness and even death in humans. Some strains are known to be more common in disease and biofilms are crucial for survival in the environment and transmission to humans. To unravel the genetic basis of biofilm formation, we undertook a study employing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and gene transcription profiling. We identified 273 genes associated with robust biofilm formation through GWAS and discovered differential expression in 220 genes through RNAseq. Statistical analysis revealed fewer overlapping genes than expected by chance, supporting an evolutionary scenario where initial adaptation relies on gene expression variation, followed by slower adaptation through genetic changes within the core genome.\n\nData summaryShort read genome data are available from the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) SRA (Sequence Read Archive), associated with BioProject PRJNA971143 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA971143).

    "abstract": "Considering it is common to find as much as 100-fold variation in the number of 16S rRNA gene sequences found across samples in a study, researchers need to control for the effect of uneven sequencing effort. How to do this has become a contentious question. Some have argued that rarefying or rarefaction is \"inadmissible\" because it omits valid data. A number of alternative approaches have been developed to normalize and rescale the data that purport to be invariant to the number of observations. I generated community distributions based on 12 published datasets where I was able to assess the ability of multiple methods to control for uneven sequencing effort. Rarefaction was the only method that could control for variation in uneven sequencing effort when measuring commonly used alpha and beta diversity metrics. Next, I compared the false detection rate and power to detect true differences between simulated communities with a known effect size using various alpha and beta diversity metrics. Although all methods of controlling for uneven sequencing effort had an acceptable false detection rate when samples were randomly assigned to two treatment groups, rarefaction was consistently able to control for differences in sequencing effort when sequencing depth was confounded with treatment group. Finally, the statistical power to detect differences in alpha and beta diversity metrics was consistently the highest when using rarefaction. These simulations underscore the importance of using rarefaction to normalize the number of sequences across samples in amplicon sequencing analyses.\n\nImportanceSequencing 16S rRNA gene fragments has become a fundamental tool for understanding the diversity of microbial communities and the factors that affect their diversity. Due to technical challenges, it is common to observe wide variation in the number of sequences that are collected from different samples within the same study. However, the diversity metrics used by microbial ecologists are sensitive to differences in sequencing effort. Therefore, tools are needed to control for the uneven levels of sequencing. This simulation-based analysis shows that despite a longstanding controversy, rarefaction is the most robust approach to control for uneven sequencing effort. The controversy started because of confusion over the definition of rarefaction and violation of assumptions that are made by methods that have been borrowed from other fields. Microbial ecologists should use rarefaction.",

Multiple cofactors, including exposure conditions and host traits, influence culture predictions for total RNA quantities spanning twelve orders of magnitude.

    "abstract": "Reduced oxygen availability (hypoxia) triggers adaptive cellular responses via hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-dependent transcriptional activation. Adaptation to hypoxia also involves transcription-independent processes like post-translational modifications, however these mechanisms are poorly characterized. Investigating the involvement of protein SUMOylation in response to hypoxia, we discovered that hypoxia strongly decreases the SUMOylation of Exosome subunit 10 (EXOSC10), the catalytic subunit of the RNA exosome, in a HIF-independent manner. EXOSC10 is a multifunctional exoribonuclease enriched in the nucleolus that mediates the processing and degradation of various RNA species. We demonstrate that the Ubiquitin-specific protease 36 (USP36) SUMOylates EXOSC10 and we reveal SUMO1/sentrin-specific peptidase 3 (SENP3) as the enzyme mediating deSUMOylation of EXOSC10. Under hypoxia, EXOSC10 dissociates from USP36 and translocates from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm concomitant with its deSUMOylation. Loss of EXOSC10 SUMOylation does not detectably affect rRNA maturation but affects the mRNA transcriptome by modulating the expression levels of hypoxia-related genes. Our data suggest that dynamic modulation of EXOSC10 SUMOylation and localization under hypoxia regulates the RNA degradation machinery to facilitate cellular adaptation to low oxygen conditions.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria play a pivotal role in lifespan regulation, though the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. As ageing progresses, damaged mitochondria with reduced ATP production and increased Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) generation accumulate, yet mitochondrial depletion extends the lifespan of various animal models. Our previous research demonstrated that complex I (CI) activity during development but not adulthood is crucial for determining the lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster. Still, CI-deficient mitochondria do not generate excessive ROS, failing to recapitulate mitochondrial ageing. In this study, we focus on complex IV (CIV), whose depletion leads to the accumulation of \"old-mitochondria\", i.e. producing less ATP and more ROS. We reveal that CIVs role in longevity is more intricate than CIs, shaping lifespan through two \"windows of opportunity\". The first window, shared by CI and CIV, occurs during development. Small perturbations in CIV during development lead to the emergence of short-lived flies. These flies exhibit an adult phenotype reminiscent of mitochondrial- associated diseases, primarily characterised by their inability to store fat efficiently. Accordingly, partial complementation of CIV function using an alternative oxidase (AOX) restores molecular and physiological phenotypes. The second window emerges during fly senescence, where CIV deficiency curtails lifespan without hastening ageing--flies die earlier but not more rapidly. Notably, only the developmental phenotype is associated with TOR dysregulation and altered autophagy, emphasising that developmental dysfunction uniquely interferes with nutrient sensing and the main cellular recycling pathway. This study sheds light on the multifaceted role of mitochondrial complex IV in modulating lifespan, providing potential targets for interventions to foster healthy ageing.",

    "abstract": "The PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway is an adaptive defense system wherein piRNAs guide PIWI-family Argonaute proteins to recognize and silence ever-evolving selfish genetic elements and ensure genome integrity. Driven by this intensive host-pathogen arms race, piRNA pathway and its targeted transposons have co-evolved rapidly in a species-specific manner, but how the piRNA pathway specifically adapts to target silencing in mammals remains elusive. Here, we show that mouse MILI and human HILI piRISCs bind and cleave targets more efficiently than their invertebrate counterpart from sponge Ephydatia fluviatilis. The inherent functional differences comport with structural features identified by cryo-EM studies of piRISCs. In the absence of target, MILI and HILI piRISCs adopt a wider nucleic-acid-binding channel and display an extended prearranged piRNA seed as compared to EfPiwi piRISC, consistent with their ability to capture targets more efficiently than EfPiwi piRISC. In the presence of target, the seed gate--which enforces seed-target fidelity in microRNA RISC--adopts a relaxed state in mammalian piRISC, revealing how MILI and HILI tolerate seed-target mismatches to broaden the target spectrum. A vertebrate-specific lysine distorts the piRNA seed, shifting the trajectory of the piRNA-target duplex out of the central cleft and toward the PAZ lobe. Functional analyses reveal that this lysine promotes target binding and cleavage. Our study therefore provides a molecular basis for the piRNA targeting mechanism in mouse and human, and suggests that mammalian piRNA machinery can achieve broad target silencing using a limited supply of piRNA species.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIt is well recognized that obesity leads to arterial endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease. However, the progression to endothelial dysfunction is not clear. Endothelial cells (ECs) adapt to the unique needs of their resident tissue and respond to systemic metabolic perturbations. We sought to better understand how obesity affects EC phenotypes in different tissues specifically focusing on mitochondrial gene expression.\n\nMethodsWe performed bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) on mesenteric and adipose ECs isolated from normal chow (NC) and high fat diet (HFD) fed mice. Differential gene expression, gene ontology pathway, and transcription factor analyses were performed. We further investigated our hypothesis in humans using published human adipose single nuclei RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) data.\n\nResultsBulk RNA-seq revealed higher mitochondrial gene expression in adipose ECs compared to mesenteric ECs in both NC and HFD mice. We then performed scRNA-seq and categorized EC clusters as arterial, capillary, venous, or lymphatic. HFD decreased the number of differentially expressed genes between mesenteric and adipose ECs in all subtypes, but the largest effect was seen in arterial ECs. Further analysis of arterial ECs revealed genes coding for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation proteins were enriched in adipose compared to mesentery under NC conditions. In HFD mice, these genes were decreased in adipose ECs becoming similar to mesenteric ECs. Transcription factor analysis revealed C/EBP and PPAR{gamma}, both known to regulate lipid handling and metabolism, had high specificity scores in the NC adipose artery ECs. These findings were recapitulated in snRNA-seq data from human adipose.\n\nConclusionsThese data suggest mesenteric and adipose arterial ECs metabolize lipids differently and the transcriptional phenotype of these two vascular beds converge in obesity, in part, due to downregulation of PPAR{gamma} and C/EBP in adipose artery ECs. This work lays the foundation for investigating vascular bed specific adaptations to obesity.",

A global genome-resolved co-activity network revealed a significant number of inter-lineage associations across large phylogenetic distances. Identified co-active communities included species displaying smaller genomes but encoding a higher potential for quorum sensing, biofilm formation, and secondary metabolism. Community metabolic modelling revealed a higher potential for interaction within co-active communities and pointed towards conserved metabolic cross-feedings, in particular of specific amino acids and group B vitamins.

    "abstract": "Transcriptional regulation is a complex process that is controlled by a variety of factors, including enhancers and silencers. Silencers, also known as repressor elements, play a crucial role in the fine-tuning of gene expression by inhibiting or suppressing transcription in the human genome. Although significant progresses have been made, genome-wide silencer research is still in its early stages. Here, we used a genome-wide method called massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) to identify silencers in three human cell lines: K562, LNCap, and HEK293T. We identified 739,434, 643,484, and 491,952 silencer regions in these cell lines, respectively. We found that most of the silencers we identified had inhibitory activity and significantly enriched inhibitory motifs. These results confirm that silencers are ubiquitous in the human genome and play an important role in regulating gene expression. Therefore, our study provides a general strategy for genome-wide functional identification of silencer elements. This information could be used to better understand the mechanisms of gene regulation and to develop new therapeutic strategies for diseases that are caused by dysregulation of gene expression.",

Here, we present the structural analysis of the endogenous TREX complex of S. cerevisiae purified from its native environment. To this end, we used cross-linking mass spectrometry to gain structural information on regions of the complex that are not accessible to classical structural biology techniques. We also used negative-stain electron microscopy to investigate the organization of the cross-linked complex used for XL-MS by comparing our endogenous TREX complex with recently published structural models of recombinant THO-Sub2 complexes. According to our analysis, the endogenous yeast TREX complex preferentially assembles into a dimer. The overall structures of the recombinant yeast THO-Sub2 complexes strongly resemble the structural conformation of the monomers and the dimer interface of the endogenous TREX complex.",

    "abstract": "Type III CRISPR-Cas systems provide a sequence-specific adaptive immune response that protects prokaryotic hosts against viruses and other foreign genetic invaders. These crRNA-guided Cas effector complexes bind and cleave complementary RNA targets. Specific target binding stimulates the Cas10 subunit to generate cyclic oligoadenylate (cOA) signaling molecules, that in turn allosterically activate proteins carrying cognate sensory domains: CARF or SAVED. Here, we characterize an elaborate set of genes associated with the type III-B CRISPR-Cas system from Haliangium ochraceum, which includes a signal transduction module of a CBASS defense system with two caspase-like proteases, SAVED-CHAT and PCaspase (Prokaryotic Caspase). We show that binding of a 3-nucleotide cOA (cA3) to the SAVED domain of SAVED-CHAT induces its oligomerization into long filaments that activate the proteolytic activity of the CHAT domain. Surprisingly, we find that activated SAVED-CHAT specifically cleaves and activates the second protease, PCaspase. In turn, activated PCaspase cleaves a multitude of other proteins, including a putative sigma factor and a PCaspase-inhibitor. We expressed the type III-B system and its associated genes in E. coli and observed a strong abortive phenotype when offering a complementary target RNA, but only in the presence of both SAVED-CHAT and PCaspase. Together, our findings show an intriguing cascade of proteolytic activities (conceptually similar to eukaryotic caspases) in this bacterial immune system that reveals yet another strategy to effectively defend against mobile genetic elements.",

    "abstract": "The demographic and genetic impacts of powdery mildew on the early stages of an oak population were studied in an ad hoc field design with two disease exposures. This enabled a detailed phenotypic monitoring of 1,733 emerging individuals from 15 progenies over nine years, and the genotyping of 68% of them. The pathogen induced high levels of seedling mortality several years after sowing, associated with reduced growth and capacity to overwinter. The probability of juvenile survival could be predicted from mean disease severity in early years and acorn weight. Fast-growing families showed the highest survival rate under both natural and protected disease exposure. Correlatively, no equalizing effect of increased powdery mildew pressure on the relative contribution of mother trees to the next generation could be detected. Contrary to a possible trade-off hypothesis between growth and defense, family height potential was not negatively related to disease resistance across the studied oak mother trees. Overall, our results suggest that in Quercus robur natural populations, infection levels (related to resistance sensu stricto) may be less determinant than growth-related tolerance to infection for the fate of seedlings. However, an equalizing effect of powdery mildew on relative oak genotype performances cannot be excluded at later stages since such an effect was already visible on height. Average genomic diversity was not significantly affected by mortality associated with powdery mildew. However, our study brings support to a deleterious effect of very low individual heterozygosity on the probability of survival across the different families. Finally, our study points to a few candidate genes for several fitness-related traits.",

Disrupted functional connectivity between the thalamus and somatomotor/frontoparietal cortex has been implicated in cross-sectional studies of 22qDel, idiopathic schizophrenia, and youth at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis. Here, we use a novel functional atlas approach to investigate longitudinal age-related changes in network-specific thalamocortical functional connectivity (TCC) in 22qDel and typically developing (TD) controls.\n\nMethodsTCC was calculated for nine functional networks derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) scans collected from n=65 22qDel participants (63.1% female) and n=69 demographically matched TD controls (49.3% female), ages 6 to 23 years. Analyses included 86 longitudinal follow-up scans. Non-linear age trajectories were characterized with general additive mixed models (GAMMs).\n\nResultsIn 22qDel, TCC in the frontoparietal network increases until approximately age 13, while somatomotor and cingulo-opercular TCC decrease from age 6 to 23. In contrast, no significant relationships between TCC and age were found in TD controls. Somatomotor connectivity in 22qDel is significantly higher than TD in childhood, but lower in late adolescence. Frontoparietal TCC shows the opposite pattern.\n\nConclusions22qDel is associated with aberrant development of functional network connectivity between the thalamus and cortex. Younger individuals with 22qDel have lower frontoparietal connectivity and higher somatomotor connectivity than controls, but this phenotype may normalize or partially reverse by early adulthood. Altered maturation of this circuitry may underlie elevated neuropsychiatric disease risk in this syndrome.",

As experimentally derived cell counts are often unavailable, computational solutions have been adopted to estimate the proportion of different cell-types using DNA methylation data. Here, we validate and profile the use of an expanded reference DNA methylation dataset incorporating two neuronal- and three glial-cell subtypes for quantifying the cellular composition of the human cortex.\n\nResultsWe tested eight reference panels containing different combinations of neuronal- and glial-cell types and characterized their performance in deconvoluting cell proportions from computationally reconstructed or empirically-derived human cortex DNA methylation data. Our analyses demonstrate that these novel brain deconvolution models produce accurate estimates of cellular proportions from profiles generated on postnatal human cortex samples, they are not appropriate for the use in prenatal cortex or cerebellum tissue samples. Applying our models to an extensive collection of empirical datasets, we show that glial cells are twice as abundant as neuronal cells in the human cortex and identify significant associations between increased Alzheimers disease neuropathology and the proportion of specific cell types including a decrease in NeuNNeg/SOX10Neg nuclei and an increase of NeuNNeg/SOX10Pos nuclei.\n\nConclusionsOur novel deconvolution models produce accurate estimates for cell proportions in the human cortex.

    "abstract": "Lesch-Nyhan disease (LND) is a rare genetic disorder induced by deficiency in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), an enzyme of the purine salvage pathway. This leads in early age to hyperuricemia and severe neurobehavioral disturbances, including dystonia, spasticity and compulsive self-injury. To date, no treatment is available for these neurological symptoms and no animal model recapitulates all the defects observed in LND patients. Here we studied LND-related mechanisms in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. We confirmed that no HGPRT activity is expressed in this organism, where the only purine-recycling enzyme is adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (Aprt). This enzyme is also present in humans but its deficiency does not trigger neurological defects. In contrast, we observed that Drosophila Aprt mutants showed both metabolic and neurobehavioral disturbances, including increased uric acid levels, locomotor reactivity impairments, sleep alterations, seizure-like behavior, reduced lifespan, and reduction of adenosine signaling and content. Locomotor defects could be rescued by neuronal Aprt re-expression in mutant context and reproduced by knocking down Aprt selectively in the protocerebral anterior medial (PAM) clusters of dopaminergic neurons, the mushroom bodies and glia subsets. Ingestion of allopurinol normalized uric acid levels in Aprt mutants but not their neurological defects, as is the case in LND patients, whereas feeding adenosine or N6-methyladenosine during development fully rescued the epileptic behavior. Intriguingly, pan-neuronal expression of an LND-associated mutant form of human HGPRT (I42T), but not the wild-type enzyme, resulted in early locomotor defects and seizure in flies, similar to Aprt deficiency. Overall, this shows that Drosophila can be used as a new model in different ways to better understand LND and seek a cure for this dramatic disease.",

    "abstract": "Myelination is the terminal step in a complex and precisely timed program that orchestrates the proliferation, migration and differentiation of oligodendroglial cells. It is thought that Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) acting on Smoothened (Smo) participates in regulating this process, but that these effects are highly context dependent. Here, we investigate oligodendroglial development and remyelination from three specific transgenic lines: NG2-CreERT2 (control), Smofl/fl/NG2-CreERT2 (loss of function) and SmoM2/NG2-CreERT2 (gain of function), as well as pharmacological manipulation that enhance or inhibit the Smo pathway (SAG or cyclopamine treatment respectively). To explore the effects of Shh/Smo on differentiation and myelination in vivo, we developed a highly quantifiable model by transplanting OPCs in the retina. We find that myelination is greatly enhanced upon cyclopamine treatment and hypothesize that Shh/Smo could promote OPC proliferation to subsequently inhibit differentiation. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that the genetic activation of Smo significantly increased numbers of OPCs and decreased oligodendrocyte differentiation when we examined the corpus callosum during development and after cuprizone demyelination and remyelination. However, upon loss of function with the conditional ablation of Smo, myelination in the same scenarios are unchanged. Taken together, our present findings suggest that the Shh pathway is sufficient to maintain OPCs in an undifferentiated state, but is not necessary for myelination and remyelination.",
