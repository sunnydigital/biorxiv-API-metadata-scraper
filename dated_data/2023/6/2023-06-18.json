    "abstract": "P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is a prototypical ABC transporter of great biological and clinical significance that confers cancer multidrug resistance and mediates the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of many drugs1-3. Decades of structural and biochemical studies have provided insights into how Pgp binds diverse compounds4-9, but how they are translocated through the membrane has remained elusive. Here, we covalently attached a cyclic substrate to discrete sites of Pgp and determined multiple complex structures in inward- and outward-facing states by cryoEM. In conjunction with molecular dynamics simulations, our structures trace the substrate passage across the membrane and identify conformational changes in transmembrane helix 1 (TM1) as regulators of substrate transport. In mid-transport conformations, TM1 breaks at glycine 72. Mutation of this residue significantly impairs drug transport of Pgp in vivo, corroborating the importance of its regulatory role. Importantly, our data suggest that the cyclic substrate can exit Pgp without the requirement of a wide-open outward-facing conformation, diverting from the common efflux model for Pgp and other ABC exporters. The substrate transport mechanism of Pgp revealed here pinpoints critical targets for future drug discovery studies of this medically relevant system.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescence nanoscopy has become increasingly powerful for biomedical research, but it has historically afforded a small field-of-view (FOV) around 50 {micro}m x 50 {micro}m at once and more recently up to ~200 {micro}m x 200 {micro}m. Efforts to further increase the FOV in fluorescence nanoscopy have thus far relied on the use of fabricated waveguide substrates, adding cost and sample constraints on the applications. Here we report PRism-Illumination and Microfluidics-Enhanced DNA-PAINT (PRIME-PAINT) for multiplexed fluorescence nanoscopy across millimeter-scale FOVs. Built upon the well-established prism-type total internal reflection microscopy, PRIME-PAINT achieves robust single-molecule localization with up to ~520 {micro}m x 520 {micro}m single FOVs and 25-40 nm lateral resolutions. Through stitching, nanoscopic imaging over mm2 sample areas can be completed in as little as 40 minutes per target. An on-stage microfluidics chamber facilitates probe exchange for multiplexing and enhances image quality particularly for formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections. We demonstrate the utility of PRIME-PAINT by analyzing ~106 caveolae structures in ~1,000 cells and imaging entire pancreatic cancer lesions from patient tissue biopsies. By imaging from nanometers to millimeters with multiplexity and broad sample compatibility, PRIME-PAINT will be useful for building multiscale, Google-Earth-like views of biological systems.",

    "abstract": "Microbial electrosynthesis is an emerging biosynthesis technology that produces value-added chemicals and fuels and, at the same time, reduces the environmental carbon footprint. However, constraints, such as low current densities and high inner resistance, disfavor this technology for industrial-scale purposes. The cathode performance has been strongly improved in recent years, while the anode performance has not been given enough attention despite its importance in closing the electric circuit. For traditional water electrolysis, O2 is produced at the anode, which is toxic to the anaerobic autotrophs that engage in microbial electrosynthesis. To overcome O2 toxicity in conventional microbial electrosynthesis, the anode and the cathode chamber have been separated by an ion-exchange membrane to avoid contact between the microbes and O2. However, ion-exchange membranes increase the maintenance costs and compromise the production efficiency by introducing an additional internal resistance. Furthermore, O2 is inevitably transferred to the catholyte due to diffusion and electro-osmotic fluxes that occur within the membrane. Here, we proved the concept of integrating carbon oxidation with sacrificial anodes and microbes to simultaneously inhibit the O2 evolution reaction (OER) and circumvent membrane application, which allows microbial electrosynthesis to proceed in a single chamber. The carbon-based anodes performed carbon oxidation as the alternative reaction to the OER. This enables microbial electrosynthesis to be performed with cell voltages as low as 1.8-2.1 V at 10 A{middle dot}m-2. We utilized Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus {Delta}H in a single-chamber Bioelectrochemical system (BES) with the best performing carbon-based anode (i.e., activated-carbon anode with soluble iron) to achieve a maximum cathode-geometric CH4 production rate of 27.3 L{middle dot}m-2{middle dot}d-1, which is equal to a volumetric methane production rate of 0.11 L{middle dot}L-1{middle dot}d-1 in our BES, at a coulombic efficiency of 99.4%. In this study, Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus {Delta}H was majorly limited by sulfur that inhibited electromethanogenesis. However, this proof-of-concept study allows microbial electrosynthesis to be performed more energy-efficiently and can be immediately utilized for research purposes in microbial electrosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "Combinatoric linguistic operations underpin human language processes, but how meaning changes over time is not well understood. We address this puzzle by exploiting the ubiquitous function of negation. We track the online effects of negation (\"not\") and intensifiers (\"really\") on the representation of scalar adjectives (e.g., \"good\") in parametrically designed behavioral and neurophysiological (MEG) experiments. The behavioral data show that participants first interpret negated adjectives as affirmative and then modify their interpretation towards, but never exactly as, the opposite meaning. Decoding analyses of neural activity further reveal that negation does not invert the representation of adjectives (i.e., \"not bad\" represented as \"good\") but rather mitigates their representation, at early lexical-semantic processing stages. This putative suppression mechanism of negation is supported by increased synchronization of beta-band neural activity in sensorimotor areas. The analysis of negation provides a steppingstone to understand how the human brain represents changes of meaning over time.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic placement, the problem of placing sequences into phylogenetic trees, has been limited either by the number of sequences placed in a single run or by the size of the placement tree. The most accurate scalable phylogenetic placement method with respect to the number of query sequences placed, EPA-ng, has a runtime that scales sub-linearly to the number of query sequences. However, larger phylogenetic trees cause an increase in EPA-ngs memory usage, limiting the method to placement trees of up to 10,000 sequences. Our recently designed SCAMPP framework has been shown to scale EPA-ng to larger placement trees of up to 200,000 sequences by building a subtree for the placement of each query sequence. The approach of SCAMPP does not take advantage of EPA-ngs parallel efficiency since it only places a single query for each run of EPA-ng. Here we present BATCH-SCAMPP, a new technique that overcomes this barrier and enables EPA-ng and other phylogenetic placement methods to scale to ultra-large backbone trees and many query sequences.

    "abstract": "Glial cells in the peripheral nerve wrap axons to insulate them and ensure efficient conduction of neuronal signals. In the myelin sheath, it is proposed that the autotypic tight junctions and adherens junctions form glia-glia complexes that stabilize the glia sheath in myelinating glia. Yet the role of adhesion junctions in non-myelinating glia of vertebrates or invertebrates has not been clearly established. Many components of adhering junctions contain PDZ (PSD-95, Dlg, ZO1) domains or are recruited to these junctions by PDZ binding motifs. To test for the role of PDZ domain proteins in glial sheath formation, we carried out an RNAi screen using Drosophila melanogaster to knockdown each of the 66 predicted PDZ domain proteins in the peripheral glia. We identified six PDZ genes with potential roles in glial morphology, and further investigated Discs-large 5 (Dlg5), a scaffolding protein with no previously known function in glia. Knockdown of Dlg5 disrupts subperineurial glia (SPG) morphology, including gaps in the membrane that coincide with disruption of septate junction proteins. To further our investigation of Dlg5, we focused on cadherins and found both N-Cadherin and E-Cadherin are expressed throughout peripheral glia. Knockdown of E-Cadherin phenocopied the loss of Dlg5 leading to gaps in the SPG and septate junctions while only simultaneous loss of both N-Cadherins (NCad, and CadN2) had the same effect. The loss of all three Cadherins enhanced these phenotypes as did loss of Dlg5 when paired with cadherin knockdown. This leads to a model where Dlg5 plays a role in conjunction with cadherins in glial membrane stabilization and septate junction formation in the subperineurial glia.",

Strengthening the consolidation of the fear-inhibitory safety memory formed during extinction is one way to counteract return of fear. In this preregistered direct replication study in male participants, we confirm that spontaneous post-extinction reactivations of a neural activation pattern evoked in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) during extinction predict extinction memory retrieval 24 h later. We do not confirm that L-DOPA administration after extinction enhances retrieval and that this is mediated by enhancement of the number of vmPFC reactivations. However, additional non-preregistered analyses reveal a beneficial effect of L-DOPA on extinction retrieval when controlling for the trait-like stable baseline levels of salivary alpha-amylase enzymatic activity (trait sAA) levels that participants show on the three experimental days. Further, trait sAA negatively predicts retrieval, and this effect is rescued by L-DOPA treatment. Our results suggest that individuals with high basal levels of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity may have poor extinction and that L-DOPA may be selectively beneficial for these individuals, which holds potential for clinical applications.",

This systematic review analyzed the diversity of metastrongyles in marine mammals and the host and parasite traits associated with virulence. There have been at least 40 species of metastrongyles described in 66 species of marine mammals. After penalization for study biases, Halocercus hyperoodoni, Otostrongylus circumlitus, Parafilaroides gymnurus, Halocercus brasiliensis, and Stenurus minor were the metastrongyles with the widest host range. Most studies (80.12%, n=133/166) reported that metastrongyles caused bronchopneumonia, while in the cardiovascular system metastrongyles caused vasculitis in nearly half of the studies (45.45%, n=5/11) that assessed these tissues. Metastrongyles were associated with otitis in 23.08% (n=6/26) of the studies. Metastrongyle infection was considered a potential contributory to mortality in 44.78% (n=90/201) of the studies while 10.45% (n=21/201) of these studies considered metastrongyles the main cause of death. Metastrongyle species with a wider host range were more likely to induce pathogenic effects. Metastrongyles can cause significant tissue damage and mortality in marine mammals although virulent host-parasite relationships are dominated by a few metastrongyle species with wider host ranges.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=96 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/527020v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (23K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9a3e28org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@66c8eborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10cffforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c781df_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) are cold-water stenotherms in the northern hemisphere. As they are long-lived and have a complex life history, developing an operational model of population dynamics has been a challenge, especially in the context of an ever increasing and varied human footprint upon nature. Here we review past efforts at understanding the population dynamics of snow crab in an environmentally and spatiotemporally heterogeneous area, the Scotian Shelf of the northwest Atlantic of Canada. We address these difficulties with a moderately complex multi-stage, delay differential model and parameterize it leveraging Bayesian techniques. Operational solutions were stable and reasonable and permitted inference upon the intra-annual dynamics of snow crab. Further, a concept of a Fisheries footprint, akin to instantaneous fishing mortality rate, can be elucidated that directly addresses the conceptual impact of a fishery upon a non-stationary population. The approach is promising. The model suggests additional processes need to be accounted. We hypothesize that seasonal, interannual movement and spatiotemporally structured predation are key processes that require further attention. However, as computational costs are significant, these additional processes will need to be parameterized carefully.",

    "abstract": "Hemodynamics is crucial for the activation and aggregation of platelets in response to flow-induced shear. In this paper, a novel image-based computational model simulating blood flow through and around platelet aggregates is presented. The microstructure of aggregates was captured by two different modalities of microscopy images of in vitro whole blood perfusion experiments in microfluidic chambers coated with collagen. One set of images captured the geometry of the aggregate outline, while the other employed platelet labelling to infer the internal density. The platelet aggregates were modelled as a porous medium, the permeability of which was calculated with the Kozeny-Carman equation. The computational model was subsequently applied to study hemodynamics inside and around the platelet aggregates. The blood flow velocity, shear stress and kinetic force exerted on the aggregates were investigated and compared under 800 s-1, 1600 s-1 and 4000 s-1 wall shear rates. The advection-diffusion balance of agonist transport inside the platelet aggregates was also evaluated by local Peclet number. The findings show that the transport of agonists is not only affected by the shear rate but also significantly influenced by the microstructure of the aggregates. Moreover, large kinetic forces were found at the transition zone from shell to core of the aggregates, which could contribute to identifying the boundary between the shell and the core. The shear rate and the rate of elongation flow were investigated as well. The results imply that the emerging shapes of aggregates are highly correlated to the shear rate and the rate of elongation. The framework provides a way to incorporate the internal microstructure of the aggregates into the computational model and yields a better understanding of the hemodynamics and physiology of platelet aggregates, hence laying the foundation for predicting aggregation and deformation under different flow conditions.\n\nAuthor summaryThe initial step in the formation of an arterial thrombus is the rapid aggregation of the tiny blood particles called platelets. This process significantly influences the formation and structure of the resulting thrombi. The mechanical properties of the aggregates depend on their microstructure, which in turn is dictated by their interaction with the flow during formation. However, due to currently existing technological limitations, it is not possible to measure these interactions in sufficient detail experimentally. In this paper, an image-based computational model is proposed based on two different modalities of experimental images, that can complement the experiments and give detailed information on hemodynamics during the aggregation. The image sets are captured from whole blood perfused microfluidic chambers coated with collagen. One modality of images captured the shape of the aggregate outline with high contrast, while the other employed platelet labeling to infer the internal density. The platelet aggregates are considered as porous media in the simulations, informed by the images. This framework incorporates the internal microstructure of the aggregates into the computational model and yields a better understanding of the hemodynamics and physiology of platelet aggregates, hence laying the foundation for predicting aggregation and deformation under different flow conditions.",

The purpose of this study was to reveal the relationship between medial meniscus degeneration and characteristics of subchondral bone changes in different models\n\nDesignWe used the anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACL-T) model, destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) model, controlled abnormal tibial translation (CATT) model and a controlled abnormal tibial rotation (CATR) model with different mechanical stresses. We performed histological analysis and micro computed tomography analysis, at 4 and 6 weeks. In addition, we divided the tibial subchondral bone into four compartments and set the regions of interest\n\nResultsMeniscus degeneration was observed in all groups, but there was no significant difference. The ACL-T group showed posterior displacement of the contact area, and the DMM and CATR groups showed lateral deviation of the medial meniscus. The region-specific subchondral bone changes in each model showed that changes in mechanical stress due to ACL and meniscus dysfunction, as well as changes in the contact area, affect the bony structure of the subchondral bone differently in each region.\n\nConclusionsSubchondral bone changes in different models of mechanical stress were different in each region. In particular, changes in the contact area and increased compressive stress due to meniscus dysfunction were suggested to promote bone formation. The results of this study indicate that changes in alignment and contact area in the PTOA model may cause region-specific characteristics of the subchondral bone changes.",

Conventionally, Pearson correlation between regional time-courses is used as a pairwise measure for each edge weight of the connectome. Building upon recent advances in graph signal processing, we propose here to estimate the graph structure as a whole by considering all time-courses at once.

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, has had an enduring impact on global public health. However, SARS-CoV-2 is only one of multiple pathogenic human coronaviruses (CoVs) to have emerged since the turn of the century. CoVs encode for several nonstructural proteins (NSPS) that are essential for viral replication and pathogenesis. Among them is nsp15, a uridine-specific viral endonuclease that is important in evading the host immune response and promoting viral replication. Despite the established function of nsp15 as a uridine-specific endonuclease, little is known about other determinants of its cleavage specificity. In this study we investigate the role of RNA secondary structure in SARS-CoV-2 nsp15 endonuclease activity.\n\nUsing a series of in vitro endonuclease assays, we observed that thermodynamically stable RNA structures were protected from nsp15 cleavage relative to RNAs lacking stable structure. We leveraged the s2m RNA from the SARS 3UTR as a model for our structural studies as it adopts a well-defined structure with several uridines, two of which are unpaired and thus high probably targets for nsp15 cleavage. We found that SARS-CoV-2 nsp15 specifically cleaves s2m at the unpaired uridine within the GNRNA pentaloop of the RNA. Further investigation revealed that the position of uridine within the pentaloop also impacted nsp15 cleavage efficiency, suggesting that positioning within the pentaloop is necessary for optimal presentation of the scissile uridine and alignment within the nsp15 catalytic pocket. Our findings indicate that RNA secondary structure is an important determinant of nsp15 cleavage and provides insight into the molecular mechanisms of recognition of RNA by nsp15.",

    "abstract": "The expansion and intensification of livestock production is predicted to promote the emergence of pathogens. As pathogens sometimes jump between species this can affect the health of humans as well as livestock. Here we investigate how livestock microbiota can act as a source of these emerging pathogens through analysis of Streptococcus suis, a ubiquitous component of the respiratory microbiota of pigs that is also a major cause of disease on pig farms and an important zoonotic pathogen. Combining molecular dating, phylogeography and comparative genomic analyses of a large collection of isolates, we find that several pathogenic lineages of S. suis emerged in the 19th and 20th centuries, during an early period of growth in pig farming. These lineages have since spread between countries and continents, mirroring trade in live pigs. They are distinguished by the presence of three genomic islands with putative roles in metabolism and cell adhesion, and an ongoing reduction in genome size, which may reflect their recent shift to a more pathogenic ecology. Reconstructions of the evolutionary histories of these islands reveal constraints on pathogen emergence that could inform control strategies, with pathogenic lineages consistently emerging from one subpopulation of S. suis and acquiring genes through horizontal transfer from other pathogenic lineages. These results shed light on the capacity of the microbiota to rapidly evolve to exploit changes in their host population and suggest that the impact of changes in farming on the pathogenicity and zoonotic potential of S. suis is yet to be fully realised.",

    "abstract": "In vertebrates, folliculogenesis and ovulation are regulated by two distinct pituitary gonadotropins: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Today, there is an intriguing consensus that a single hypothalamic neurohormone, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), regulates the secretion of both FSH and LH, although the required timing and functions of FSH and LH are different. However, recent studies in vertebrates other than mammals indicate that the effect of GnRH on FSH is too weak to explain its regulation. Therefore, to challenge this \"solo GnRH model,\" we aimed to identify the other gonadotropin regulator, FSH-releasing hormone (FSH-RH), in vertebrates. Here, by using the model teleost medaka, we successfully identified cholecystokinin as the FSH-RH. Our histological and in vitro analyses demonstrated that hypothalamic cholecystokinin-expressing neurons directly affect FSH cells through the cholecystokinin receptor, Cckbr1, thereby increasing the expression and release of FSH. Remarkably, the knockout of cholecystokinin ligand or cckbr1 minimized FSH expression and resulted in a complete failure of folliculogenesis. Our results challenge the longstanding consensus of the solo GnRH model in all vertebrates; instead, we propose the existence of a \"dual GnRH model\" group in vertebrates that utilizes both FSH-RH and LH-RH. The discovery of the FSH-RH in vertebrates opens not only a new era in neuroendocrinology but also possible applications involving vertebrate reproduction.",

Despite remarkable recent progress in accurately designing new self-assembling proteins, the size and complexity of these assemblies has been limited by a reliance on strict symmetry 4,5. Inspired by the pseudosymmetry observed in bacterial microcompartments and viral capsids, we developed a hierarchical computational method for designing large pseudosymmetric self-assembling protein nanomaterials. We computationally designed pseudosymmetric heterooligomeric components and used them to create discrete, cage-like protein assemblies with icosahedral symmetry containing 240, 540, and 960 subunits. At 49, 71, and 96 nm diameter, these nanoparticles are the largest bounded computationally designed protein assemblies generated to date. More broadly, by moving beyond strict symmetry, our work represents an important step towards the accurate design of arbitrary self-assembling nanoscale protein objects.",

    "abstract": "Endogenous NAD(P)H and FAD two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) images provide functional metabolic information with high spatial resolution for a wide range of living specimens. Preservation of metabolic function optical metrics upon fixation would facilitate studies which assess the impact of metabolic changes in the context of numerous diseases. However, robust assessments of the impact of formalin fixation, paraffin embedding, and sectioning on the preservation of optical metabolic readouts are lacking. Here, we evaluate intensity and lifetime images at excitation/emission settings optimized for NAD(P)H and FAD TPEF detection from freshly excised murine oral epithelia and corresponding bulk and sectioned fixed tissues. We find that fixation impacts the overall intensity as well as the intensity fluctuations of the images acquired. Accordingly, the depth-dependent variations of the optical redox ratio (defined as FAD/(NAD(P)H + FAD)) across squamous epithelia are not preserved following fixation. This is consistent with significant changes in the 755 nm excited spectra, which reveal broadening upon fixation and additional distortions upon paraffin embedding and sectioning. Analysis of fluorescence lifetime images acquired for excitation/emission settings optimized for NAD(P)H TPEF detection indicate that fixation alters the long lifetime of the observed fluorescence and the long lifetime intensity fraction. These parameters as well as the short TPEF lifetime are significantly modified upon embedding and sectioning. Thus, our studies highlight that the autofluorescence products formed during formalin fixation, paraffin embedding and sectioning overlap highly with NAD(P)H and FAD emission and limit the potential to utilize such tissues to assess metabolic activity.",

However, microbial synthesis of vanillin is hindered by the host native metabolism that could rapidly degrade vanillin to the byproducts. Here, we report that the industrial workhorse Saccharomyces cerevisiae was engineered by systematic deletion of oxidoreductases to improve the vanillin accumulation. Subsequently, we harnessed the reduced aromatic aldehyde reduction (RARE) yeast platform for de novo synthesis of vanillin from glucose. We investigated multiple coenzyme-A free pathways to improve vanillin production in yeast. The vanillin productivity in yeast was further enhanced by systems engineering to optimize the supply of cofactors (NADPH and S-adenosylmethionine) together with metabolic reconfiguration of yeast central metabolism. The final yeast strain with overall 24 genetic modifications produced 365.55 {+/-} 7.42 mg L-1 under shake-flasks, which represents the highest vanillin titer from glucose achieved to date. Taken together, our work lays a foundation for the future implementation of vanillin production from glucose in budding yeast.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=109 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/545388v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19c47dcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@131eb80org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5c5a8forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13d6485_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG TOC\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy has shown limited success in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients. To improve clinical management of cancer, it is crucial to identify alternative immunostimulatory targets associated with mechanisms of tumor evolution to facilitate the development of novel combination immunotherapies. Here we categorized PDACs and other cancers (n>7,500) into subgroups based on immunostimulatory glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-related ligand (GITRL) and receptor (GITR) expression: GITRLhigh+GITRhigh and GITRLhigh/low+GITRlow. We characterized immune evasion mechanisms using immunotherapy preclinical trials in four representative immunocompetent mouse models, finding that the GITR agonist, DTA-1 significantly improved responses in GITRLhigh(+GITRhigh) tumors (n=2). Further characterization revealed increased activation of CD8+ T-cells (but not T-regulatory; Tregs cells) and enhanced interferon-{gamma}, immunoproteosome, antigen presentation, and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene expression in DTA-1 responders. In vivo clonal tracking using DNA barcoding showed that GITR agonist therapy significantly reduced tumor burden by targeting expansion of heterogeneous PDAC clones and not clone-initiating cells (representing potential resistance). However, emerging GITRLhigh+GITRhigh epithelial-like oligoclones from the responder model escaped immune surveillance to GITR agonist treatment via increased PD-L1, offering a combined anti-PD-L1, CD40 agonist and DTA-1 immunotherapy regimens (with/without chemotherapy) that further improved responses by decreasing PD-L1+ myeloid cells. Conversely, mesenchymal-enriched GITRLlow models exhibited primary (intrinsic) resistance to GITR agonist treatment due to reduced T-cells and increased myeloid and/or PD-L1+ non-immune cells. These results provide pre-clinical context for GITR+PD-L1+CD40- based personalized immuno-chemotherapy combinations for PDAC.",

The amount of each variant depends on the cell type, the cell cycle phase, and the time of development and can be altered in disease. However, the mechanisms regulating H1 protein levels have not been described. We have analyzed the contribution of the proteasome to the degradation of H1 variants in human cells using two different inhibitors, MG132 and bortezomib. H1 variants accumulate upon treatment with both drugs indicating the role of the proteasome in the regulation of H1 protein levels. The global increase in histone H1 caused slight changes in chromatin as the excess is accumulated in the cytoplasm, presumably to prevent alterations in the nuclear processes. We analyzed the pathway of H1 degradation by the proteasome. Our results suggest that H1 degradation is ubiquitin-independent, whereas the whole protein and its C-terminal domain can be degraded by 20S proteasome. Our findings revealed a new regulatory mechanism for histone H1 degradation, where its basicity and intrinsically disordered domains are responsible for its targeting and degradation by the 20S proteasome.",

The visual system estimates an objects lightness from the light reflected off its surface. The light reflected also depends on object extrinsic properties of the scene. For stable perception, the visual system needs to discount variations due to extrinsic properties. We characterize this perceptual stability for variation in two spectral properties of the scene: the reflectance spectra of background objects and the intensity of light sources. We use a two-alternative forced-choice task to measure human observers thresholds of discriminating computer-generated images of 3D scenes based on the lightness of a spherical target object in the scene. We measured how the discrimination thresholds changed as we varied the reflectance spectra of the objects and the intensity of the light sources in the scene, both individually and simultaneously. For small amounts of extrinsic variations, the thresholds of discrimination remained constant indicating that the thresholds were dominated by observers intrinsic representation of lightness. As extrinsic variation increased, it started affecting observers lightness judgment and the thresholds increased. We estimated that the effects of extrinsic variations were comparable to observers intrinsic variation in the representation of object lightness. Moreover, for simultaneous variation of these spectral properties, the increase in threshold square compared to no variation condition was a linear sum of the corresponding increase in threshold squares for the individual properties, indicating that the variation from these independent sources combines linearly.",

We observe numerous Arabidopsis clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) around B. cinerea infection sites and the colocalization of B. cinerea EV marker BcPLS1 and Arabidopsis CLATHRIN LIGHT CHAIN 1, one of the core components of CCV. Meanwhile, BcPLS1 and the B. cinerea-secreted sRNAs are detected in purified CCVs after infection. Arabidopsis knockout mutants and inducible dominant-negative mutants of key components of CME pathway exhibit increased resistance to B. cinerea infection. Furthermore, Bc-sRNA loading into Arabidopsis AGO1 and host target gene suppression are attenuated in those CME mutants.

    "abstract": "The self-organization of the serotonergic matrix, a massive axon meshwork in all vertebrate brains, is driven by the structural and dynamical properties of its constitutive elements. Each of these elements, a single serotonergic axon (fiber), has a unique trajectory and can be supported by a soma that executes one of many available transcriptional programs. It necessitates the development of specialized methods for single-fiber analyses, both at the experimental and theoretical levels. We developed an integrated system that facilitates experimental isolation of single serotonergic fibers in brain tissue, including regions with high fiber densities, and demonstrated the potential of their quantitative analyses based on stochastic modeling. Single fibers were visualized using two transgenic mouse models, one of which is the first implementation of the Brainbow toolbox in this system. The trajectories of serotonergic fibers were automatically traced in the three spatial dimensions with a novel algorithm, and their properties were captured with a single parameter associated with the directional von Mises-Fisher probability distribution. The system represents an end-to-end workflow that can be imported into various studies, including those investigating serotonergic dysfunction in brain disorders. It also supports new research directions inspired by single-fiber analyses in the serotonergic matrix, including supercomputing simulations and modeling in physics.",

    "abstract": "The phoretic mite assemblage of the Douglas-fir beetle, Dendroctonus pseudotsugae Hopkins (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) has not been as thoroughly documented as that of some other ecologically and economically important bark beetle species. Phoretic mites can impact individual fitness and population dynamics of their hosts and documenting the mite assemblage associated with a bark beetle may provide information on their ecological and interactive roles. We caught Douglas-fir beetles over two summers in central British Columbia, Canada and sorted the associated mites into morphospecies. Representatives of the morphospecies were DNA barcoded (cytochrome oxidate I barcode region) which indicated at least nine distinct Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs). There was a mean of 50.5 {+/-} 4.7 mites per beetle with both females and males carrying similar numbers of most mite species. However one OTU (Sarcoptiformes: Hemisarcoptidae) was found in substantially higher numbers than all other OTUs, and was always clustered in large aggregations in an anterior pocket on the sub-elytral surface. When B1 was removed from the mean, there were only 1.3 {+/-} 0.2 mites per beetle. The consistent high numbers of that OTU in conjunction with its consistent anatomical aggregation suggests an important interaction between that mite species and the Douglas-fir beetle.",

    "abstract": "As humans increasingly modify the natural world, many animals have responded by changing their behaviour. Predicting the extent of these responses is a key step in conserving these species. For example, the tendency for some species of birds to incorporate anthropogenic items - particularly plastic material - into their nests is of increasing concern, as in some cases this behaviour has harmful effects on both adults and young. Studies of this phenomenon, however, have to date been limited in geographic and taxonomic scope. To investigate the global correlates of anthropogenic (including plastic) nest material use, we used Bayesian phylogenetic mixed models and a dataset of recorded nest materials in 6,147 species of birds. We find that after controlling for research effort, anthropogenic nest material use is correlated with proximity to human landscape modification, synanthropic (artificial) nesting locations, breeding environment, and the number of materials that has been recorded within the species nest. We also demonstrate that anthropogenic nest material use is unrelated to body mass, range size, or conservation status. These results indicate that anthropogenic materials are more likely to be included in nests when they are more readily available, as well as potentially by species who have more flexibility in nest material choice.",

    "abstract": "1In animal species with fission-fusion dynamics, individuals can split from or follow others during collective movements. In spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) this decision depends in part on the information they have about the location of available feeding trees. Foraging widely and continuously splitting and joining from others, individuals could be pooling their partial information such that the group as a whole has a more complete picture of a heterogeneous foraging environment. Here we use individual utilization areas over a realistic foraging landscape to infer the sets of potentially known trees by each individual. Then we measure the spatial entropy of these areas, considering tree species diversity and spatial distribution. We measure how complementary pairs of areas are, by decomposing the spatial entropy into redundant and unique components. We find that the areas uniquely known by each pair member still contain considerable amounts of information, but there is also a high redundancy in the information that a pair has about the foraging landscape. The networks joining individuals based on the unique information components seem to be structured efficiently for information transmission. Distributed foraging in fission-fusion dynamics would be an example of adaptive pooling of information and thus, collective intelligence.",

Today, hemodiafiltration (HDF) which combines HD and hemofiltration has been widely used as an alternative to conventional HD in many countries. HDF is known to outperform conventional HD, offering more effective waste clearance and better fluid balance to patients. However, HDF requires newer-generation machines that are not accessible in many under-resourced geographical regions and societies. This study investigates a facile adaptation of conventional HD machines to achieve HDF. The objectives are to address the premature obsolescence of older but fully functional machines and to advocate for equal access to improved medical care and treatment.\n\nMethodsA bench-top experimental setup was established to evaluate the performance of HDF using a two-filter adaptation in comparison to that of standard HD. Urea clearance, human serum album loss, and hemolysis were assessed under identical operational conditions for both configurations.\n\nFindingsOur results show that the HDF configuration outperformed the HD configuration, with significantly higher urea clearance (268.31{+/-}44.17 mL/min via HDF vs. 53.33{+/-}13.20 mL/min via HD), but comparable human serum albumin loss and hemolysis levels.\n\nDiscussionThe explored two-filter adaptation presents a cost-effective method to achieve HDF with improved performance using conventional HD machines, with no added risk to patients. Further validation on patients in a hospital setting is necessary.",

We evaluate DINO on a wide variety of tasks across three publicly available imaging datasets of diverse specifications and biological focus. We find that DINO encodes meaningful features of cellular morphology at multiple scales, from subcellular and single-cell resolution, to multi-cellular and aggregated experimental groups. Importantly, DINO successfully uncovers a hierarchy of biological and technical factors of variation in imaging datasets. The results show that DINO can support the study of unknown biological variation, including single-cell heterogeneity and relationships between samples, making it an excellent tool for image-based biological discovery.",

This paper presents results of a systematic analysis of the 3D structure of proteins with 6-crossings knots predicted by the artificial intelligence program AlphaFold 2. Furthermore, using a coarse-grained native based model, we found that three representative proteins can self tie to a 63 knot, the most complex knot found in a protein thus far. Because it is not a twist knot, the 63 knot cannot be folded via a simple mechanism involving the threading of a single loop. Based on successful trajectories for each protein, we determined that the 63 knot is formed after folding a significant part of the protein backbone to the native conformation. Moreover, we found that there are two distinct knotting mechanisms, which are described here. Also, building on a loop flipping theory developed earlier, we present two new theories of protein folding involving the creation and threading of two loops, and explain how our theories can describe the successful folding trajectories for each of the three representative 63-knotted proteins.",

    "abstract": "By sensing changes in intracellular Ca2+, small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) channels dynamically regulate the dynamics of the cardiac action potential (AP) on a beat-to-beat basis. Given their predominance in atria vs. ventricles, SK channels are considered a promising atrial-selective pharmacological target against atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common cardiac arrhythmia. However, the precise contribution of SK current (ISK) to atrial arrhythmogenesis is poorly understood, and may potentially involve different mechanisms that depend on species, heart rates, and degree of AF-induced atrial remodeling. Both reduced and enhanced ISK have been linked to AF. Similarly, both SK channel up- and downregulation have been reported in chronic AF (cAF) vs. normal sinus rhythm (nSR) patient samples. Here, we use our multi-scale modeling framework to obtain mechanistic insights into the contribution of ISK in human atrial myocyte electrophysiology. We simulate several protocols to quantify how ISK modulation affects the regulation of AP duration (APD), Ca2+ transient, refractoriness, and occurrence of alternans and delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs). Our simulations show that ISK activation shortens the APD and atrial effective refractory period, limits Ca2+ cycling, and slightly increases the propensity for alternans in both nSR and cAF conditions. We also show that increasing ISK counteracts DAD development by reducing the coupling between transmembrane potential and intracellular Ca2+. Taken together, our results suggest that increasing ISK in human atrial myocytes could promote reentry, while protecting against triggered activity. Depending on the leading arrhythmogenic mechanism, ISK inhibition may thus be a beneficial or detrimental anti-AF strategy.",

    "abstract": "Tef (Eragrostis tef (Zucc.) Trotter) is an important staple crop in Ethiopia and Eritrea. Its grains are gluten-free and protein rich, so it is considered as a \"super-food\". Adapting tef to modern farming practices could allow its intensive growth in other regions and enable larger communities to gain from its nutritional values. However, high lodging susceptibility prevents the application of mechanical harvest and causes significant yield losses. Lodging describes the displacement of roots (root lodging) or fracture of culms (stem lodging), forcing plants to bend or fall from their vertical position. Lodging is facilitated by various abiotic and biotic factors, and the lodging severity is increased in overpopulated fields. In this study, we aimed to understand the microstructural properties of crown roots, underlining tef tolerance/susceptibility to lodging. We analyzed plants at 5 and 10 weeks after emergence and compared trellised to lodged plants. Root cross sections from different tef genotypes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, micro computed tomography and Raman micro spectroscopy. Lodging susceptible genotypes exhibited early tissue maturation, including developed aerenchyma, intensive lignification, and lignin with high levels of crosslinks. A comparison between trellised and lodged plants suggested that lodging itself does not affect the histology of root tissue. Furthermore, cell wall composition along plant maturation was typical to each of the tested genotypes independently of trellising. Our results suggest that it is possible to select lines that exhibit slow maturation of crown roots. Such lines are predicted to show reduction in lodging and facilitate mechanical harvest.",

    "abstract": "Construction of organ-specific gene expression datasets that include hundreds to thousands of experiments would greatly aid reconstruction of gene regulatory networks with organ-level spatial resolution. However, creating such datasets is greatly hampered by the requirements of extensive and tedious manual curation. Here we trained a supervised classification model that can accurately classify the organ-of-origin for a plant transcriptome. This K-Nearest Neighbor-based multiclass classifier was used to create organ-specific gene expression datasets for the leaf, root, shoot, flower, seed, seedling, silique, and stem in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. In the leaf, root, flower, seed and, a gene regulatory network (GRN) inference approach was used to determine: i. influential transcription factors (TFs) in that organ and, ii. the most influential TFs for specific biological processes in the organ. These genome-wide, organ-delimited GRNs (OD-GRNs), identified de novo many known regulators of organ development and processes operating in those organs. Moreover, many previously unknown TF regulators were highly ranked as potential master regulators of organ development or organ-specific processes. As a proof-of-concept, we focused on experimentally validating the predicted TF regulators of lipid biosynthesis in seeds, with relevance to food and biofuel production. Of the top twenty candidate TFs, eight (e.g., WRI1, LEC1, and FUS3) are known regulators of seed oil content. Importantly, we validated that seven more candidate TFs, whose role was previously unknown in seed lipid biosynthesis, indeed affect this process by genetics and physiological approaches, thus yielding a net accuracy rate of >75% for the de novo TF predictions. The general approach developed here could be extended to any species with sufficiently large gene expression datasets to speed up hypothesis generation and testing for constructing gene regulatory networks at a high spatial resolution.\n\nSignificance StatementOur study develops a machine-learning framework for building extremely large gene expression datasets for each organ, and to infer organ-delimited gene regulatory networks. We show that this approach is very successful at predicting which transcription factors are going to regulate processes at an organ level. We validated the accuracy of the predictions for transcription factor regulators using the seed lipid synthesis pathway as a case study. We demonstrated a very high success rate for uncovering both known and novel transcription factor regulators for the seed lipid biosynthesis pathway. The approach described in this study is broadly applicable across any organism (plant or animal) that has a large body of public gene expression data.",

Small oval cutouts were made from leaves of the grasshoppers preferred food source, Iochroma arborescens (Solanaceae), and were combined with small pieces of tape and dry grass to construct artificial leaves resembling the day and night form of A. pintoi. In the experiment, groups of three grasshoppers were starved for 24 hours and then placed in petri dishes containing one closed and one open artificial leaf. After 30 six-hour trials, the average herbivory of open leaves was 12.3%, while closed leaves was 5.2% (p = 0.00145), indicating a significant preference for open leaves.

Application of NMF on gene expression data has been limited by its computationally intensive nature, which hinders its use on large datasets such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) count matrices. We have implemented NMF based clustering to run on high performance GPU compute nodes using CuPy, a GPU backed python library, and the Message Passing Interface (MPI). This reduces the computation time by up to three orders of magnitude and makes the NMF Clustering analysis of large RNA-Seq and scRNA-seq datasets practical. We have made the method freely available through the GenePattern gateway, which provides free public access to hundreds of tools for the analysis and visualization of multiple  omic data types. Its web-based interface gives easy access to these tools and allows the creation of multi-step analysis pipelines on high performance computing (HPC) clusters that enable reproducible in silico research for non-programmers.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationNMFClustering is freely available on the public GenePattern server at https://genepattern.ucsd.edu.

    "abstract": "As single-cell sequencing data sets grow in size, visualizations of large cellular populations become difficult to parse and require extensive processing to identify subpopulations of cells. Managing many of these charts is laborious for technical users and unintuitive for non-technical users. To address this issue, we developed TooManyCellsInteractive (TMCI), a browser-based JavaScript application for visualizing hierarchical cellular populations as an interactive radial tree. TMCI allows users to explore, filter, and manipulate hierarchical data structures through an intuitive interface while also enabling batch export of high-quality custom graphics. Here we describe the software architecture and illustrate how TMCI has identified unique survival pathways among drug-tolerant persister cells in a pan-cancer analysis. TMCI will help guide increasingly large data visualizations and facilitate multi-resolution data exploration in a user-friendly way.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe 3 end of a gene, often called a terminator, modulates mRNA stability, localization, translation, and polyadenylation. Here, we adapted Plant STARR-seq, a massively parallel reporter assay, to measure the activity of over 50,000 terminators from the plants Arabidopsis thaliana and Zea mays. We characterize thousands of plant terminators, including many that outperform bacterial terminators commonly used in plants. Terminator activity is species-specific, differing in tobacco leaf and maize protoplast assays. While recapitulating known biology, our results reveal the relative contributions of polyadenylation motifs to terminator strength. We built a computational model to predict terminator strength and used it to conduct in silico evolution that generated optimized synthetic terminators. Additionally, we discover alternative polyadenylation sites across tens of thousands of terminators; however, the strongest terminators tend to have a dominant cleavage site. Our results establish features of plant terminator function and identify strong naturally occurring and synthetic terminators.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary compromises are thought to be common under fluctuating selection because the mutations that best enable adaptation to one environmental context can often be detrimental in others. Yet, prior experimental work has shown that generalists can sometimes perform as well as specialists in their own environments. Here we use a highly replicated evolutionary experiment (N = 448 asexual lineages of the brewers yeast) to show that even though fluctuation between two environmental conditions often induces evolutionary compromises (at least early on), it can also help reveal difficult to reach adaptive outcomes that ultimately improve performance in both environments. Specifically, we begin by showing that yeast adaptation to chemical stress can involve fitness tradeoffs with stress-free environments and that, accordingly, lineages that are repeatedly exposed to occasional stress tend to respond by trading performance for breadth of adaptation. We then show that on rare occasions, fluctuating selection leads to the evolution of no-cost generalists that can even outcompete constant selection specialists in their own environments. We propose that the discovery of these broader and more effective adaptive outcomes under fluctuating selection could be partially facilitated by changes in the adaptive landscape that result from having to deal with fitness tradeoffs across different environmental conditions. Overall, our findings indicate that reconciling the short- and long-term evolutionary consequences of fluctuating selection could significantly improve our understanding of the evolution of specialization and generalism.",

    "abstract": "Long-read RNA sequencing is essential to produce accurate and exhaustive annotation of eukaryotic genomes. Despite advancements in throughput and accuracy, achieving reliable end-to-end identification of RNA transcripts remains a challenge for long-read sequencing methods. To address this limitation, we developed CapTrap-seq, a cDNA library preparation method, which combines the Cap-trapping strategy with oligo(dT) priming to detect 5capped, full-length transcripts, together with the data processing pipeline LyRic. We benchmarked CapTrap-seq and other popular RNA-seq library preparation protocols in a number of human tissues using both ONT and PacBio sequencing. To assess the accuracy of the transcript models produced, we introduced a capping strategy for synthetic RNA spike-in sequences that mimics the natural 5cap formation in RNA spike-in molecules. We found that the vast majority (up to 90%) of transcript models that LyRic derives from CapTrap-seq reads are full-length. This makes it possible to produce highly accurate annotations with minimal human intervention.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionTumor-associated macrophages may act to either limit or promote tumor growth, yet the molecular basis for either path is poorly characterized.\n\nMethodsWe use a larval Drosophila model that expresses a dominant-active version of the Rasoncogene (RasV12) to study dysplastic growth during early tumor progression. We performed single-cell RNA-sequencing of macrophage-like hemocytes to characterize these cells in tumor-compared to wild type larvae. Hemocytes included manually extracted tumor-associated-as well as circulating cells.\n\nResults and discussionWe identified 5 distinct hemocyte clusters. In addition to RasV12 larvae we included a tumor model where the activation of effector caspases was inhibited, mimicking an apoptosis-resistant setting. Circulating hemocytes from both tumor models differ qualitatively from control wild-type cells - they display an enrichment for genes involved in cell division, which was confirmed using proliferation assays. Split analysis of the tumor models further reveals that proliferation is strongest in the caspase-deficient setting. Similarly, depending on the tumor model, hemocytes that attach to tumors activate different sets of immune effectors - antimicrobial peptides dominate the response against the tumor alone, while caspase inhibition induces a shift toward members of proteolytic cascades. Finally, we provide evidence for transcript transfer between hemocytes and possibly other tissues. Taken together, our data support the usefulness of Drosophila to study the response against tumors at the organismic level.",

    "abstract": "Small colony variants (SCVs) are relatively common among some bacterial species and are associated with poor prognosis and recalcitrant infections. Similarly, Candida glabrata - a major intracellular fungal pathogen - produces small and slow-growing respiratory-deficient colonies, termed \"petite.\" Despite reports of clinical petite C. glabrata strains, our understanding of petite behavior in the host remains obscure. Moreover, controversies exist regarding in-host petite fitness and its clinical relevance. Herein, we employed whole-genome sequencing (WGS), dual-RNAseq, and extensive ex vivo and in vivo studies to fill this knowledge gap. WGS identified multiple petite-specific mutations in nuclear and mitochondrially-encoded genes. Consistent with dual-RNAseq data, petite C. glabrata cells did not replicate inside host macrophages and were outcompeted by their non-petite parents in macrophages and in gut colonization and systemic infection mouse models. The intracellular petites showed hallmarks of drug tolerance and were relatively insensitive to the fungicidal activity of echinocandin drugs. Petite-infected macrophages exhibited a pro-inflammatory and type I IFN-skewed transcriptional program. Interrogation of international C. glabrata blood isolates (n=1000) showed that petite prevalence varies by country, albeit at an overall low prevalence (0-3.5%). Collectively, our study sheds new light on the genetic basis, drug susceptibility, clinical prevalence, and host-pathogen responses of a clinically overlooked phenotype in a major fungal pathogen.\n\nImportanceCandida glabrata is a major fungal pathogen, which is able to lose mitochondria and form small and slow-growing colonies, called \"petite\". This attenuated growth rate has created controversies and questioned the clinical importance of petiteness. Herein, we have employed multiple omicstechnologies and in vivo mouse models to critically assess the clinical importance of petite phenotype. Our WGS identifies multiple genes potentially underpinning petite phenotype. Interestingly, petite C. glabrata cells engulfed by macrophages are dormant and therefore are not killed by the frontline antifungal drugs. Interestingly, macrophages infected with petite cells mount distinct transcriptomic responses. Consistent with our ex-vivo observations, mitochondrial-proficient parental strains outcompete petites during systemic and gut colonization. Retrospective examination of C. glabrata isolates identified petite prevalence a rare entity, can significantly vary from country to country. Collectively, our study overcomes the existing controversies and provides novel insights regarding the clinical relevance of petite C. glabrata isolates.",

    "abstract": "As one of the earliest livestock, Sheep (Ovis aries) were domesticated in the Fertile Crescent about 12000 - 10000 years ago and have a nearly worldwide distribution today. Most of our knowledge about the timing of their expansions stems from archaeological data but it is unclear how the genetic diversity of modern sheep fits with these dates. We used whole-genome sequencing data of 63 domestic breeds and their wild relatives, the Asiatic mouflon (O. gmelini), to explore the demographic history of sheep. On the global scale, our analysis revealed geographic structuring among breeds with unidirectional recent gene flow from domestics into Asiatic mouflons. We then selected four representative breeds from Spain, Morocco, the UK and Iran to build a comprehensive demographic model of the Western sheep expansion. We inferred a single domestication event around 9000 years ago, slightly later than archaeological evidence suggests which might reflect uncertainties in the generation time used for these estimates. The westward expansion is dated to approximately 5000 years ago, later than the original Neolithic expansion of sheep and approximately matching the Secondary Product Revolution associated with woolly sheep. We see some signals of recent gene flow from an ancestral population into Southern European breeds which could reflect admixture with feral European mouflon. Furthermore, our results indicate that many breeds experienced a reduction of their effective population size during the last centuries, probably associated with modern breed development. Our study provides insights into the complex demographic history of Western Eurasian sheep, highlighting interactions between breeds and their wild counterparts.",

    "abstract": "SummaryO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSWith the emergence of microglia-modulating therapies there is an urgent need for reliable biomarkers to evaluate microglial activation states.\n\nMethodsUsing mouse models and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia (hiMGL), which were genetically modified to yield the most opposite homeostatic (TREM2- knockout) and disease-associated (GRN-knockout) states, we identified microglia activity-dependent markers. Non-targeted mass spectrometry was used to identify changes in microglial and cerebrospinal (CSF) proteome of Grn- and Trem2-knockout mice. Additionally, we analyzed the proteome of GRN- and TREM2-knockout hiMGL and their conditioned media. Candidate marker proteins were tested in two independent patient cohorts, the ALLFTD cohort with 11 GRN mutation carriers and 12 non-carriers, as well as the proteomic data set available from the European Medical Information Framework Alzheimers Disease Multimodal Biomarker Discovery (EMIF-AD MBD).\n\nFindingsWe identified proteomic changes between the opposite activation states in mouse microglia and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as well as in hiMGL cell lysates and conditioned media. For further verification, we analyzed the CSF proteome of heterozygous GRN mutation carriers suffering from frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We identified a panel of six proteins (FABP3, MDH1, GDI1, CAPG, CD44, GPNMB) as potential indicators for microglial activation. Moreover, we confirmed three of these proteins (FABP3, GDI1, MDH1) to be significantly elevated in the CSF of AD patients. In AD, these markers differentiated amyloid-positive cases with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from amyloid-negative individuals.\n\nInterpretationThe identified candidate proteins reflect microglia activity and may be relevant for monitoring the microglial response in clinical practice and clinical trials modulating microglial activity and amyloid deposition. Moreover, the finding that three of these markers differentiate amyloid-positive from amyloid-negative MCI cases in the AD cohort suggests that these marker proteins associate with a very early immune response to seeded amyloid. This is consistent with our previous findings in the DIAN (Dominantly Inherited Alzheimers Disease Network) cohort, where soluble TREM2 increases as early as 21 years before symptom onset. Moreover, in mouse models for amyloidogenesis, seeding of amyloid is limited by physiologically active microglia further supporting their early protective role. The biological functions of some of our main candidates (FABP3, CD44, GPNMB) also further emphasize that lipid dysmetabolism may be a common feature of neurodegenerative disorders.\n\nFundingThis work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germanys Excellence Strategy within the framework of the Munich Cluster for Systems Neurology (EXC 2145 SyNergy - ID 390857198 to CH, SFL and DP) and a Koselleck Project HA1737/16-1 (to CH).",

    "abstract": "The highly conserved eukaryotic histone chaperone ASF1 is involved in the assembly and disassembly of nucleosomes during transcription, DNA replication and repair. It was the first chaperone discovered to be involved in all three of these processes. The filamentous fungus Sordaria macrospora is one of only two multicellular organisms where asf1 deletions are viable, which makes it useful for in vivo analysis of this central part of eukaryotic chromatin structure. Deletion of asf1 in S. macrospora leads to sterility, a reduction of DNA methylation, and upregulation of genes that are usually weakly expressed in the wild type. Here, we focused on the functions of the highly conserved core and the divergent C-terminal tail of ASF1, studied the effects of ASF1 on histone modifications and tested its relevance for genomic stability. By Co-IP and complementation analysis we showed that substitutions of amino acid V94 or truncations of the C-terminal tail abolish histone binding and do not complement the sterile mutant phenotype. {Delta}asf1 is sensitive to the DNA damaging agent MMS, while complementation strains, even those with non-histone-binding variants, regain wild type-like resistance. To aid in subsequent ChIP-seq and Hi-C analyses, we generated a chromosome-resolved genome assembly of S. macrospora. ChIP-Seq analysis revealed a global increase of H3K27me3 in {Delta}asf1, accompanied by a global decrease of H3K56ac. By using Hi-C we detected a tandem duplication of around 600 kb on chromosome 2 in the mutant. Crossing experiments indicated linkage between the viability of {Delta}asf1 strains and the presence of the duplication.\n\nImportanceHistone chaperones are proteins that are involved in nucleosome assembly and disassembly and can therefore influence all DNA-dependent processes including transcription, DNA replication and repair. ASF1 is a histone chaperone that is conserved throughout eukaryotes. In contrast to most other multicellular organisms, a deletion mutant of asf1 in the fungus Sordaria macrospora is viable; however, the mutant is sterile. In this study, we could show that the histone binding ability of ASF1 is required for fertility in S. macrospora, whereas the function of ASF1 in maintenance of genome stability does not require histone binding. We also showed that the histone modifications H3K27me3 and H3K56ac are misregulated in the {Delta}asf1 mutant. Furthermore, we identified a large duplication on chromosome 2 of the mutant strain that is genetically linked to the {Delta}asf1 allele present on chromosome 6, suggesting that viability of the mutant might depend on the presence of the duplicated region.",

    "abstract": "Suppression of immune response is a phenomenon that enables biological processes such as gamete fertilization, cell growth, cell proliferation, endophyte recruitment, parasitism, and pathogenesis. Here, we show for the first time that the Plasminogen-Apple-Nematode (PAN) domain present in G-type lectin receptor-like kinases is essential for immunosuppression in plants. Defense pathways involving jasmonic acid and ethylene are critical for plant immunity against microbes, necrotrophic pathogens, parasites, and insects. Using two Salix purpurea G-type lectin receptor kinases, we demonstrated that intact PAN domains suppress jasmonic acid and ethylene signaling in Arabidopsis and tobacco. Variants of the same receptors with mutated residues in this domain could trigger induction of both defense pathways. Assessment of signaling processes revealed significant differences between receptors with intact and mutated PAN domain in MAPK phosphorylation, global transcriptional reprogramming, induction of downstream signaling components, hormone biosynthesis and resistance to Botrytis cinerea. Further, we demonstrated that the domain is required for oligomerization, ubiquitination, and proteolytic degradation of these receptors. These processes were completely disrupted when conserved residues in the domain were mutated. Additionally, we have tested the hypothesis in recently characterized Arabidopsis mutant which has predicted PAN domain and negatively regulates plant immunity against root nematodes. ern1.1 mutant complemented with mutated PAN shows triggered immune response with elevated WRKY33 expression, hyperphosphorylation of MAPK and resistant to necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea. Collectively, our results suggest that ubiquitination and proteolytic degradation mediated by the PAN domain plays a role in receptor turn-over to suppress jasmonic acid and ethylene defense signaling in plants.",

The advances in studies of {Psi} in less abundant messenger RNA species have been hindered by a lack of suitable methods to precisely and sensitively map their distributions. Here we show that a methyltransferase from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii can label RNA {Psi} efficiently and specifically with various functional groups, both in isolated RNA and inside cells. We leveraged this enzymatic labeling strategy to develop ELAP-seq as a facile method to enrich {Psi}-modified transcripts for the detection of {Psi} modifications at single base resolution with high sensitivity and low background. Using this method, we identified over 10, 000 candidate {Psi} sites from human transcripts, which provides new insights into {Psi} biosynthesis and function. Our study provides a chemical biology method that specifically labels {Psi} for its detection and functional alteration.",

    "abstract": "Membrane proteins are difficult to isolate and purify due to their dependence on the surrounding lipid membrane for structural stability. Detergents are often used to solubilize these proteins, with this approach requiring a careful balance between protein solubilization and denaturation. Determining which detergent is most appropriate for a given protein has largely been done empirically through screening, which requires large amounts of membrane protein and associated resources. Here we describe an alternative to conventional detergent screening using a computational modeling approach to identify the most likely candidate detergents for solubilizing a protein of interest. We demonstrate our approach using ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT), a member of the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) family of integral membrane enzymes that has not been solubilized or purified in active form. A computationally derived GOAT structural model provides the only structural information required for this approach. Using computational analysis of detergent ability to penetrate phospholipid bilayers and stabilize the GOAT structure, a panel of common detergents were rank ordered for their proposed ability to solubilize GOAT. Independently, we biologically screened these detergents for their solubilization of fluorescently tagged GOAT constructs. We found computational prediction of protein structural stabilization was the better predictor of detergent solubilization ability, but neither approach was effective for predicting detergents that would support GOAT enzymatic function. The current rapid expansion of membrane protein computational models lacking experimental structural information and our computational detergent screening approach can greatly improve the efficiency of membrane protein detergent solubilization supporting downstream functional and structural studies.",

    "abstract": "Membrane proteins play crucial roles in numerous biological processes and are important drug targets. However, structural studies of memebrane proteins heavily rely on solubilization by detergents, which may not reflect their native states in the cellular context. Moreover, identifying suitable detergents for individual membrane proteins is a tedious and costly screening process. Here, we developed a vesicle-based method that enables membrane protein structure determination in their native lipid environment, thereby bypassing the limitations of detergent solubilization. Using this approach, we isolated vesicles containing the multidrug efflux transporter AcrB and solved its structure by cryo-electron microscopy. Intriguingly, the AcrB trimer in the vesicle exhibited a loose assembly compared to the detergent-solubilized and nanoparticle structures. Our method presents a promising approach for studying structure and function of membrane protein in their native environment without the need for detergent screening and protein purification.",

Here, using cell-layer-specific transcriptomic analysis, reverse genetics by VIGS and CRISPR, and metabolomics we identified EPIDERMIS VOLATILE EMISSION REGULATOR (EVER)--a petal adaxial epidermis-specific MYB activator that affects the emission of volatiles. Using a three-step viral-based CRISPR/Cas9 editing system, ever knockout lines were generated and together with transient suppression assays, revealed EVERs involvement in the repression of low-vapor-pressure volatiles. Internal pools and annotated scent-related genes involved in production and emission were not affected by EVER. RNA-Seq analyses of petals of ever knockout lines and EVER-overexpressing flowers revealed enrichment in wax-related biosynthesis genes. LC/GC-MS analyses of petal epicuticular waxes revealed substantial reductions in wax loads in ever petals, particularly of monomers of fatty acids and wax esters. These results implicate EVER in the emission of volatiles by fine-tuning the composition of petal epicuticular waxes. Thus, we reveal a petunia MYB regulator that interlinks epicuticular wax composition and volatile emission, thus unraveling a new regulatory layer in the scent-emission machinery in petunia flowers.",

How such modest, cell-type-selective changes can meaningfully shape organismal disease risk remains unclear. To explore this issue, we experimentally manipulated species-conserved enhancers within the disease-associated IL2RA locus and studied accompanying changes in the progression of autoimmunity. Perturbing distinct enhancers with restricted activity in conventional T cells (Tconvs) or regulatory T cells (Tregs)--two functionally antagonistic T cell subsets--caused only modest, cell-type-selective decreases in IL2ra expression parameters. However, these same perturbations had striking and opposing effects in vivo, completely preventing or severely accelerating disease in a murine model of type 1 diabetes. Quantitative tissue imaging and computational modelling revealed that each enhancer manipulation impinged on distinct IL-2-dependent feedback circuits. These imbalances altered the intracellular signaling and intercellular communication dynamics of activated Tregs and Tconvs, producing opposing spatial domains that amplified or constrained ongoing autoimmune responses. These findings demonstrate how subtle changes in gene regulation stemming from non-coding variation can propagate across biological scales due to non-linearities in intra- and intercellular feedback circuitry, dramatically shaping disease risk at the organismal level.",

    "abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease (LD), has evolved immune evasion mechanisms to establish a persistent infection in their vertebrate hosts, resulting in chronic inflammation and autoimmune T and B cell reactivity in many B. burgdorferi-infected individuals. In this study, we used an unbiased immunopeptidomics approach to identify foreign and self MHC class II peptides isolated from inguinal and popliteal lymph nodes from B. burgdorferi- infected C57BL/6 (B6) mice, which develop mild, self-limiting LD; and from infected B6 Il10-/- mice, which develop severe, persistent LD. Nearly 10,000 MHC-II peptides were identified by LC-tandem MS analysis which included many peptides derived from proteins abundant in arthritic joints that are associated with inflammation, tissue repair, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Notably, the number and variety of unique peptides derived from apolipoprotein B- 100 (apoB-100); a validated autoantigen in human Lyme arthritis (LA), atherosclerosis, and liver disease; was greatly expanded in lymph nodes of infected mice, particularly in Il10-/- mice at 4 weeks (6-fold increase) and 16 weeks (15-fold increase) post-infection, compared with uninfected mice, indicating epitope spreading. One of the apoB-100 peptides identified in infected, but not uninfected, B6 and Il10-/- mice was APOB3500-3515, an immunogenic cryptic epitope in murine autoimmune atherosclerosis. No apoB-100 peptides had sequence homology to any B. burgdorferi antigens. Surprisingly, only six peptides derived from B. burgdorferi proteins were validated in this study. One of these B. burgdorferi epitopes, derived from methyl- accepting chemotaxis protein Mcp4 (BB0680), was an immunogenic target of CD4+ T cell responses in B. burgdorferi-infected Il10-/- mice, but not in B6 mice. In conclusion, this study has shed light on the importance of IL-10 in suppressing epitope spreading and limiting B. burgdorferi-specific CD4+ T cell responses. Furthermore, this study supports epitope spreading and exposure of cryptic antigens as likely mechanisms of infection-induced apoB-100 autoimmunity in LD.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYLyme disease is caused by infection with the spirochetal pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi, and affects [~]500,000 individuals in the U.S. annually. T cell responses to both host and pathogen are dysregulated during infection, resulting in chronic infection and frequent development of autoimmunity. To assess the immune-relevant CD4+ T cell epitopes presented during development of Lyme disease, we used an unbiased, immunopeptidomics approach to characterized the MHC class II immunopeptidome in mice infected with Borrelia burgdorferi. We identified nearly 10,000 unique peptides. Peptides derived from apoB-100, a known human Lyme autoantigen, were highly enriched in infected mice, compared with uninfected controls, and showed evidence of epitope spreading. Furthermore, we identified several peptides derived from Borrelia burgdorferi, including one immunogenic peptide from a methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein, Mcp4. Interestingly, both apoB-100 epitope spreading and immune responses to Mcp4 were observed in mice lacking the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, indicating an important role of IL-10 in suppressing T cell responses to Mcp4 and epitope spreading of Lyme autoantigen apoB-100.",

    "abstract": "The KEAP1-Nrf2 axis is essential for the cellular response against metabolic and oxidative stress. KEAP1 is an adaptor protein of Cullin-3 ubiquitin ligase that controls the cellular levels of Nrf2, a critical transcription factor of several cytoprotective genes. Oxidative stress, defective autophagy and pathogenic infections activate Nrf2 signaling through phosphorylation of the adaptor protein p62, which competes with Nrf2 for binding to KEAP1. Here we show that phosphoribosyl-linked serine ubiquitination of p62 catalyzed by SidE effectors of Legionella pneumophila controls Nrf2 signaling and cell metabolism upon Legionella infection. Serine ubiquitination of p62 sterically blocks its binding to KEAP1, resulting in Nrf2 ubiquitination and degradation. This reduces Nrf2-dependent antioxidant synthesis in the early phase of infection. Levels of serine ubiquitinated p62 diminish in the later stage of infection allowing the expression of Nrf2-target genes; resulting in a differential regulation of the host metabolome and proteome in a Nrf2 dependent manner.",

However, whether corals can adapt to ocean acidification and how remains unclear. We addressed these questions by re-examining transcriptome and genome data of Acropora millepora coral holobionts from volcanic CO2 seeps with end-of-century pH levels. We show that adaptation to ocean acidification is a wholistic process involving the three main compartments of the coral holobiont. We identified 441 coral host candidate adaptive genes involved in calcification, response to acidification, and symbiosis; population genetic differentiation in dinoflagellate photosymbionts; and consistent transcriptional microbiome activity despite microbial community shifts. Coral holobionts from natural analogues to future ocean conditions harbor beneficial genetic variants with far-reaching rapid adaptation potential. In the face of climate change, these populations require immediate conservation strategies as they could become key to coral reef survival.",

Here, we introduce phase-shifting mid-infrared optothermal microscopy (PSOM) which interprets molecular-vibrational information as the optical path difference (OPD) induced by mid-infrared absorption and is capable of taking snapshot vibrational images over broad mid-infrared excitation areas at high live-cell confluency. By means of phase-shifting, PSOM suppresses noise to a quarter of current optothermal microscopy modalities to allow capturing live-cell vibrational images at FOVs up to 50 times larger than state-of-the-art.

Strategies to block CLas transmission by D. citri remain the best way to prevent the spread of the disease into new citrus growing regions. However, identifying control strategies to block HLB transmission poses significant challenges, such as the discovery and delivery of antimicrobial compounds targeting the bacterium and overcoming consumer hesitancy towards accepting the treatment. Here, we computationally identified and tested a series of 20-mer nodule-specific cysteine-rich peptides (NCRs) derived from the Mediterranean legume, Medicago truncatula Gaertn. (barrelclover) to identify those peptides that could effectively prevent or reduce CLas infection in citrus leaves and/or prevent CLas acquisition by the bacteriums insect vector, D. citri. A set of NCR peptides were tested in a screening pipeline involving three distinct assays: a bacterial culture assay, a CLas-infected excised citrus leaf assay, and a CLas-infected nymph acquisition assay that included D. citri nymphs, the only stage of D. citris life-cycle that can acquire CLas leading to the development of vector competent adult insects. We demonstrate that a subset of M. truncatula-derived NCRs inhibit both CLas growth in citrus leaves and CLas acquisition by D. citri from CLas-infected leaves. These findings reveal NCR peptides as a new class and source of biopesticide molecules to control CLas for the prevention and/or treatment of HLB.",

Since stress response is associated with changes in body temperature, the use of body surface temperature through thermal imaging could help to measure acute and chronic stress responses non-invasively. We used thermal imaging, acute handling-stress protocol and an experimental manipulation of glucocorticoid hormone levels in breeding king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus), to assess: 1. the potential contribution of the Hypothalamo-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis in mediating chronic and acute stress-induced changes in adult surface temperature, 2. the influence of HPA axis manipulation on parental investment through thermal imaging of eggs and brooded chicks, and 3. the impact of parental treatment on offspring thermals response to acute handling.\n\nEye temperature (Teye) increased and beak temperature (Tbeak) decreased in response to handling stress in adults, but neither basal nor stress-induced surface temperatures were significantly affected by glucocorticoid implants. While egg temperature was not significantly influenced by parental treatment, we found a surprising pattern for chicks: chicks brooded by the (non-implanted) partner of glucocorticoid-implanted individuals exhibited higher surface temperature (both Teye and Tbeak) than those brooded by glucocorticoid-implanted or control parents. Chicks response to handling in terms of surface temperature was characterized by a drop in both Teye and Tbeak independently of parental treatment.\n\nWe conclude that the HPA seems unlikely to play a major role in determining chronic or acute changes in surface temperature in king penguins. Changes in surface temperature may primarily be mediated by the Sympathetic-Adrenal-Medullary axis (SAM) in response to stressful situations.

Combining these data, we explored population-level ecology using genomic representation from 9,560 viral operational taxonomic units (vOTUs); nearly a 4-fold expansion from permafrost-associated soils, and 97% of which were novel when compared against large datasets from soils, oceans, and the human gut. In silico predictions identified putative hosts for 44% (4,149 dsDNA + 17 ssDNA) of the identified vOTUs spanning 2 eukaryotic, 12 archaeal, and 30 bacterial phyla. The recovered vOTUs encoded 1,684 putative auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) and other metabolic genes carried by [~]10% of detected vOTUs, of which 46% were related to carbon processing and 644 were novel. These AMGs grouped into five functional categories and 11 subcategories, and nearly half (47%) of the AMGs were involved in carbon utilization. Of these, 112 vOTUs encoded 123 glycoside hydrolases spanning 15 types involved in the degradation of polysaccharides (e.g., cellulose) to monosaccharides (e.g., galactose), or further monosaccharide degradation, which suggests virus involvement in myriad metabolisms including fermentation and central carbon metabolism. These findings expand the scope of viral roles in microbial carbon processing and suggest viruses may be critical for understanding the fate of soil organic carbon in peatlands.",

    "abstract": "Arboleda-Tham Syndrome (ARTHS, OMIM#616268) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by de novo mutations in KAT6A. Individuals with ARTHS typically exhibit varying degrees of intellectual disability, speech and language deficits and clinical manifestations across multiple systems that lead to abnormal: vision, craniofacial features, cardiac morphology, and gastrointestinal function. To gain insight into the potential neuropathological mechanisms underlying ARTHS, we investigate how KAT6A mutations disrupt in vitro brain development using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and cerebral organoids (COs) derived from ARTHS patients harboring KAT6A nonsense mutations. In this study, we conducted comprehensive transcriptomic profiling by performing time-course experiments and generating short-read and long-read RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from undifferentiated iPSCs and COs at 15 and 25 days of neural differentiation. Our analysis revealed abnormal expression of 235 genes in ARTHS across all three timepoints examined. Notably, we observed persistent dysregulation of genes such as CTSF, ZNF229, PCDHB12, and PAK3. Additionally, we found a consistent enrichment of PTBP1-target genes among the upregulated genes in ARTHS at all three stages assessed by RNA-seq. During neural differentiation, we identified 980 genes that consistently display aberrant transcription in ARTHS at both CO stages. These genes are enriched for genes involved in cell fate determination through modulation of cell-cycle dynamics (e.g. E2F family) and cell-adhesion molecules (e.g. PCDH genes). Our findings indicate that ARTHS COs exhibit slower downregulation of pluripotency and cell cycle genes compared to controls and that this delay led to an overrepresentation of cycling human neural progenitor markers during neural differentiation in ARTHS. Finally, matching the variable neurodevelopment phenotypes in ARTHS, we discovered that the aberrantly expressed genes in ARTHS are enriched for genes associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder and Epilepsy, with a subset showing isoform-specific dysregulation. Strikingly, the same PTBP1-target genes were enriched amongst the genes that display differential isoform usage in ARTHS. For the first time, we demonstrate that KAT6A mutations lead to a delay in repressing pluripotency and cell cycle genes during neural differentiation, suggesting that prolonged activation of these gene networks disrupts the temporal dynamics of human brain development in ARTHS.",

    "abstract": "Fractures caused by bone overloading are a leading cause of euthanasia in Thoroughbred racehorses. The risk of fatal fracture has been shown to be influenced by both environmental and genetic factors but, to date, no specific genetic mechanisms underpinning fracture have been identified. The aim of this study was to utilise a genome-wide polygenic risk score to establish an in vitro cell system to study bone gene regulation in horses at high and low genetic risk of fracture. Candidate gene expression analysis revealed differential expression of COL3A1 and STAT1 genes in osteoblasts derived from high and low risk horses. Whole genome sequencing of fracture case and control horses revealed a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) upstream of COL3A1 that was confirmed in a larger cohort to be significantly associated with fracture. Bioinformatics tools predicted that this SNP may impact the binding of the transcription factor SOX11. Gene modulation demonstrated SOX11 is upstream of COL3A1 and the region binds to nuclear proteins. Furthermore, luciferase assays demonstrated that the region containing the SNP has promoter activity. However, the specific effect of the SNP depends on the broader genetic background of the cells and suggest other factors may also be involved in regulating COL3A1 expression. In conclusion, this approach provides a powerful means to identify novel DNA variants and understand their mechanism of action to enable the development of new ways to identify and treat horses at high risk of a catastrophic fracture.",

    "abstract": "Dense microbial communities, like the gut and soil microbiomes, are dynamic societies. Bacteria can navigate these environments by deploying proteins (effectors) that alter foreign cells behavior. Immunity proteins preferentially protect neighboring sibling cells, in contrast to canonical toxin-antitoxin systems. A prevailing hypothesis is that when immunity proteins are bound to specific (cognate) protein partners, it is sufficient to disrupt their function; further, there is little-to-no crosstalk with other (non-cognate) effectors. Here, we build on sporadic reports challenging these hypotheses. We show that immunity proteins from a newly defined protein family can bind and protect against non-cognate PD-(D/E)XK-containing effectors from diverse phyla. We describe the domains essential for binding and function and show that binding alone is insufficient for protective activity. Moreover, we found that these effector and immunity genes co-occur in individual human microbiomes. These results expand the growing repertoire of bacterial protection mechanisms and force us to reconsider how non-cognate interactions impact community structure within complex ecosystems.",

Many of the variants altered DNA binding affinity and/or specificity. Biochemical analysis and structural modeling identified 14 novel specificity-determining positions, 5 of which do not contact DNA. The same missense substitution at analogous positions within different HDs often exhibited different effects on DNA binding. Variant effect prediction tools perform moderately well in distinguishing variants with altered binding affinity, but poorly in identifying those with altered specificity.

    "abstract": "The target of the rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway is highly conserved and important in eukaryotes. It is involved in the regulation of various biological processes. However, systematic studies on this pathway in the genus Aspergillus have not been reported. Here, we identified and characterized nine genes encoding components of the TOR pathway in A. flavus, and investigated their biological, genetic and biochemical functions. The FK506-binding protein FKBP3 and its lysine succinylation are important for aflatoxin production and rapamycin resistance. The Tor kinase plays a central role in the global regulation of growth, spore production, aflatoxin biosynthesis and rapamycin stress. As a major downstream effector molecule of Tor kinase, the Sch9 kinase might regulate the calcium and osmotic stress, AFB1 synthesis of A. flavus by its S_TKc, S_TK_X domains and ATP binding site at K340. We also showed that Sch9 kinase might mediate crosstalk between the TOR and the HOG signaling pathways. TapA and TipA, the other downstream components of Tor kinase, play important roles in regulating mycelial growth and sclerotia formation in A. flavus. The member of the TapA-phosphatase complexes Sit4 and Ppg1 are important for hyphal development, sexual reproduction, sclerotia formation, AFB1 biosynthesis, activation of the CWI and TOR signaling pathways in A. flavus. In addition, the another phosphatase complex Nem1/Spo7 play critical role in vegetative growth, conidiation, aflatoxin and LD biogenesis. This study provide new insights into constructing the regulatory network of the TOR signaling pathway and revealing the molecular mechanism of the pathogenicity in A. flavus.",

    "abstract": "Ocean warming has caused coral mass bleaching and mortality worldwide and the persistence of symbiotic reef-building corals requires rapid acclimation or adaptation. Experimental evolution of the corals microalgal symbionts followed by their introduction into coral is one potential method to enhance coral thermotolerance. Heat-evolved microalgal symbionts of the generalist species, Cladocopium proliferum (strain SS8), were exposed to elevated temperature (31{degrees}C) for [~]10 years, and were introduced into chemically bleached adult fragments of the scleractinian coral, Galaxea fascicularis. The new symbionts persisted for the five months of the experiment and enhanced adult coral thermotolerance compared with corals that were inoculated with the wild-type C. proliferum strain. Thermotolerance of SS8-corals was similar to that of coral fragments from the same colony hosting the homologous symbiont, Durusdinium sp., which is naturally heat-tolerant. However, SS8-coral fragments exhibited faster growth and recovered cell density and photochemical efficiency more quickly following chemical bleaching and inoculation under ambient temperature relative to Durusdinium-corals. Mass spectrometry imaging suggests that algal pigments involved in photobiology and oxidative stress were the greatest contributors to the thermotolerance differences between coral hosting heat-evolved versus wild-type C. proliferum. These pigments may have increased photoprotection in the heat-evolved symbionts. Our findings show that adult coral thermotolerance can be enhanced via the uptake of exogenously supplied, heat-evolved symbionts, without a trade-off against growth under ambient temperature. Heat-evolved C. proliferum remains in the corals in moderate abundance two years after its first inoculation, suggesting long-term stability of this novel symbiosis.",

    "abstract": "How neurons accomplish the growth of an axon, and several dendrites sequentially is a cellular process not well understood. Here, we show that preferential somatic F-actin delivery to neurites inhibits neurite growth during axon formation. Thus, the neurite receiving less somatic F-actin is growing as an axon. During dendrites outgrowth, radial somatic F-actin translocation into all neurites is drastically diminished suggesting that cellular growth is restricted by the somatic F-actin flow into the growing neurites. Mechanistically, we report that radial somatic F-actin translocation is mediated via the Myosin II motor. Pharmacological inhibition of these molecular motors promotes neurite elongation and precludes F-actin translocation into neurites. Moreover, we show that actin phosphorylation at Y53, which promotes F-actin instability, is enriched selectively in some neurite shafts to exclude/minimize translocation of somatic F-actin only into those neurites. Therefore, enrichment of actin pY53 in the neurite shaft correlates with the longer neurite during axon formation. Accordingly, the Kinesin-1 motor domain, which accumulates transiently in neurites of stage 2 neurons and only in the emerging axon of stage 3 neurons, localizes preferentially in the neurite with the increased actin pY53 signal in the neurite shaft. Finally, we demonstrate that microtubule acetylation promotes actin phosphorylation, and these cytoskeleton modifications coexist in the longest neurite that grows as an axon. Collectively, our data support a model in which somatic F-actin translocation into undifferentiated neurites impedes growth counteracted by actin pY53, consequently, supporting neuronal polarization during axon formation.",

However, genetic manipulation of haematopoietic progenitor cells and subsequent directed differentation into neutrophils represents a potential avenue to study the contributions of individual genes and pathways to human neutrophil function. Here we present a method of directed granulocytic CD34+ progenitor differentiation into neutrophils capable of key functions such as priming and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation. We further show that differentiating progenitors can be efficiently and stably modified by lentiviral gene delivery and Cas9-gRNP nucleofection to produce potent and activation-free gene knockdown in mature neutrophils, thereby providing new tools for understanding the contribution of neutrophils to health and disease. Using this model we have shown that, contrary to previous reports, CD11b is not required for phagocytosis of serum-opsonised bacterial particles.",

    "abstract": "The honey bee trypanosomatid parasite, Lotmaria passim, contains two genes that encode the flagellar calcium binding protein (FCaBP) through tandem duplication in its genome. FCaBPs localize in the flagellum and cell body of L. passim through specific N-terminal sorting sequences. This finding suggests that this is an example of protein subcellular relocalization resulting from gene duplication, altering the intracellular localization of FCaBP. However, this phenomenon may not have occurred in Leishmania, as one or both of the duplicated genes have become pseudogenes. Multiple copies of the FCaBP gene are present in several Trypanosoma species and Leptomonas pyrrhocoris, indicating rapid evolution of this gene in trypanosomatid parasites. The N-terminal flagellar sorting sequence of L. passim FCaBP1 interacts with the BBSome complex, while those of Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania donovani FCaBPs do not direct GFP to the flagellum in L. passim. These results suggest that the N-terminal flagellar sorting sequence of FCaBP1 has co-evolved with the BBSome complex in each trypanosomatid species. Deletion of the two FCaBP genes in L. passim affected growth and impaired flagellar morphogenesis and motility, but it did not impact host infection. Therefore, FCaBP represents a duplicated gene with a rapid evolutionary history that is essential for flagellar structure and function in a trypanosomatid parasite.",

Resistance to TDF and ISL is conferred by K65R and M184V, respectively. Furthermore, K65R and M184V increase sensitivity to ISL and TDF, respectively. Therefore, these two nucleoside analogs have opposing resistance profiles and could present a high genetic barrier to resistance. To explore resistance to TDF and ISL in combination, we performed passaging experiments with HIV-1 WT, K65R, or M184V in the presence of ISL and TDF. We identified K65R, M184V, and S68G/N mutations. The mutant most resistant to ISL was S68N/M184V, yet it remained susceptible to TDF. To further confirm our cellular findings, we implemented an endogenous reverse transcriptase assay to verify in vitro potency. To better understand the impact of these resistance mutations in the context of global infection, we determined potency of ISL and TDF against HIV subtypes A, B, C, D, and circulating recombinant forms (CRF) 01_AE and 02_AG with and without resistance mutations. In all isolates studied, we found K65R imparted hypersensitivity to ISL whereas M184V conferred resistance. We demonstrated that the S68G polymorphism can enhance fitness of drug-resistant mutants in some genetic backgrounds. Collectively, the data suggest that the opposing resistance profiles of ISL and TDF suggest that a combination of the two drugs could be a promising drug regimen for the treatment of patients infected with any HIV-1 subtype, including those who have failed 3TC/FTC-based therapies.",

    "abstract": "The Hippo pathway is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of tissue growth. Multiple Hippo signaling components are regulated via proteolytic degradation. However, how these degradation mechanisms are themselves modulated remains unexplored. Kibra is a key upstream pathway activator that promotes its own ubiquitin-mediated degradation upon assembling a Hippo signaling complex. Here, we demonstrate that Hippo complex-dependent Kibra degradation is modulated by cortical tension. Using classical genetic, osmotic, and pharmacological manipulations of myosin activity and cortical tension, we show that increasing cortical tension leads to Kibra degradation, whereas decreasing cortical tension increases Kibra abundance. Our study also implicates Par-1 in regulating Kib abundance downstream of cortical tension. We demonstrate that Par-1 promotes ubiquitin-mediated Kib degradation in a Hippo complex-dependent manner and is required for tension-induced Kib degradation. Collectively, our results reveal a previously unknown molecular mechanism by which cortical tension affects Hippo signaling and provide novel insights into the role of mechanical forces in growth control.",

    "abstract": "Toxic cellular insults activate the nuclear protein poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) to initiate parthanatos, a regulated cell death program. PAR acts as a death signal by translocating from the nucleus to the cytosol, where it activates the next steps in the parthanatic cell death cascade. How PAR translocates from the nucleus to the cytosol is not known. Here we show that PARylation and PAR binding to histone H1.2 enables it to act as a carrier, transporting PAR out of the nucleus to the cytosol. Knocking down the expression of histone H1.2 via CRISPR/Cas9 and knockout of histone H1.2 reduces the translocation of PAR to the cytosol after treatment of human cortical neurons with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) or following oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). The PAR-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase, Iduna (RNF146) ubiquitinates PARylated H1.2. Overexpression of Iduna reduces the expression levels of cytosolic histone H1.2, preventing the translocation of PAR following NMDA or OGD exposure, similar to inhibition of PAR formation by the PARP inhibitor, DPQ. Whereas, the catalytically null variant Iduna C60A, or the PAR binding mutant Iduna Y156A and R157A (YRAA) was ineffective in ubiquitinating histone H1.2 and preventing the reduction in cytosolic histone H1.2 levels and PAR translocation from the nucleus to the cytosol. Histone H1.2 heterozygote and homozygote knockout mice exhibited reduced infarct volume 24 hrs post middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and showed better recovery in motor deficits than wildtype littermates at day 3 and/or day 7 post MCAO. Collectively, these findings reveal histone H1.2 as the key carrier of PAR out of the nucleus to the cytosol where it participates in the next step of the parthanatic cell death cascade.",

    "abstract": "Post-translational covalent conjugation of ubiquitin onto proteins or ubiquitination is important in nearly all cellular processes. Steady-state ubiquitination of individual proteins in vivo is maintained by two countering enzymatic activities: conjugation of ubiquitin by E1, E2 and E3 enzymes and removal by deubiquitinases. Here, we deleted one or more genes encoding deubiquitinases in yeast and evaluated the requirements for ubiquitin conjugation onto a target protein. We verified our system using mutants lacking the deubiquitinases Ubp8 and/or Ubp10 that remove ubiquitin from histone H2B or PCNA. Our validation studies reveal that the N-terminal intrinsically disordered region and the C-terminal coiled-domain of the adapter protein Lge1 and the C-terminal acidic tail of Rad6 E2 contribute to monoubiquitination of histone H2BK123, whereas the distal acidic residues of helix-4 of Rad6, but not the acidic tail, is required for monoubiquitination of PCNA. Further, charged substitution at alanine-120 in the H2B C-terminal helix adversely affected histone H2BK123 monoubiquitination by inhibiting Rad6-Bre1-mediated ubiquitin conjugation and by promoting Ubp8/Ubp10-mediated deubiquitination. In summary, these proof-of-principle studies together demonstrate that absence of relevant deubiquitinase(s) provides a facile and versatile system that can be used to study the nuances of ubiquitin conjugation and deubiquitination of target proteins in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is a genetic disorder of intracellular endosomal trafficking defects associated with pulmonary fibrosis. Double mutant HPS1/2 mice exhibit spontaneous fibrosis and single mutant HPS1 and HPS2 mice display increased fibrotic sensitivity. To identify mechanisms of AT2 cell dysfunction contributing to fibrosis in HPS, we examined lungs from aged HPS1/2 mice and observed regions of AT2 cell loss adjacent to areas of marked AT2 cell hyperplasia as compared to wild type (WT). Overall, there was accelerated loss of AT2 cells in HPS1/2, HPS1, and HPS2 mice with aging based on immunohistochemistry and lineage tracing studies. Lung organoids generated with HPS2 AT2 cells with WT fibroblasts were smaller in size and displayed significantly decreased colony forming efficiency compared to organoids with WT AT2 cells. Utilizing an H1N1 PR8 influenza model to examine AT2 cell regeneration after injury, there was a significant decrease in the percentage of proliferating AT2 cells in HPS1 and HPS2 mice compared to WT mice. RNA sequencing of AT2 cells isolated from unchallenged mice demonstrated upregulation of genes associated with proliferation and cellular senescence in HPS AT2 cells. Collectively, AT2 cells in HPS mice exhibit dysregulated proliferation with transcriptomic features suggesting subpopulations of senescent and hyperproliferative cells. Dysregulated maintenance of the alveolar epithelium with accelerated senescence and aberrant proliferation of AT2 cells appears to be a shared pathway underlying HPS and other sporadic and genetic forms of pulmonary fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "Invadopodia are extracellular matrix (ECM) degrading structures, which promote cancer cell invasion. The nucleus is increasingly viewed as a mechanosensory organelle that determines migratory strategies. However, how the nucleus crosstalks with invadopodia is little known. Here, we report that the oncogenic septin 9 isoform 1 (SEPT9_i1) is a component of breast cancer invadopodia. SEPT9_i1 depletion diminishes invadopodia formation and the clustering of invadopodia precursor components TKS5 and cortactin. This phenotype is characterized by deformed nuclei, and nuclear envelopes with folds and grooves. We show that SEPT9_i1 localizes to the nuclear envelope and juxtanuclear invadopodia. Moreover, exogenous lamin A rescues nuclear morphology and juxtanuclear TKS5 clusters. Importantly, SEPT9_i1 is required for the amplification of juxtanuclear invadopodia, which is induced by the epidermal growth factor. We posit that nuclei of low deformability favor the formation of juxtanuclear invadopodia in a SEPT9_i1-dependent manner, which functions as a tunable mechanism for overcoming ECM impenetrability.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThe oncogenic SEPT9_i1 is enriched in breast cancer invadopodia in 2D and 3D ECM\nC_LIO_LISEPT9_i1 promotes invadopodia precursor clustering and invadopodia elongation\nC_LIO_LISEPT9_i1 localizes to the nuclear envelope and reduces nuclear deformability\nC_LIO_LISEPT9_i1 is required for EGF-induced amplification of juxtanuclear invadopodia\nC_LI\n\neTOC BlurbInvadopodia promote the invasion of metastatic cancers.

This is mysterious, because development of such animals is partly organized by homologous genes with similar complex expression patterns, termed \"deep homology\".\n\nHere we report twenty-five regulatory DNA segments conserved across bilaterian animals, of which seven are also conserved in cnidaria (coral and sea anemone). They control developmental genes (e.g. Nr2f, Ptch, Rfx1/3, Sall, Smad6, Sp5, Tbx2/3), including six homeobox genes: Gsx, Hmx, Meis, Msx, Six1/2, and Zfhx3/4. The segments contain perfectly or near-perfectly conserved CCAAT boxes, E-boxes, and other sequences recognized by regulatory proteins. More such DNA conservation will surely be found soon, as more genomes are published and sequence comparison is optimized. This reveals a control system for animal development conserved since the Precambrian.",

    "abstract": "Tunicates are the sister group to the vertebrates, yet most species have a life cycle split between swimming larva and sedentary adult phases. During metamorphosis, larval neurons are largely replaced by adult-specific ones. Yet the regulatory mechanisms underlying this neural replacement remain largely unknown. Using tissue-specific CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis in the tunicate Ciona, we show that orthologs of conserved hindbrain and branchiomeric neuron regulatory factors Pax2/5/8 and Phox2 are required to specify the \"Neck\", a compartment of cells set aside in the larva to give rise to cranial motor neuron-like neurons in the adult. Using bulk and single-cell RNAseq analyses, we also characterize the transcriptome of the Neck downstream of Pax2/5/8. Surprisingly, we find that Neck-derived adult ciliomotor neurons begin to differentiate in the larva, contrary to the long-held assumption that the adult nervous system is formed only after settlement and the death of larval neurons during metamorphosis. Finally, we show that manipulating FGF signaling during the larval phase alters the patterning of the Neck and its derivatives. Suppression of FGF converts Neck cells into larval neurons that fail to survive metamorphosis, while prolonged FGF signaling promotes an adult neural stem cell-like fate instead.",
