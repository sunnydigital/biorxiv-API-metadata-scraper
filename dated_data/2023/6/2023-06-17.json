    "abstract": "Neurons throughout the sensory pathway adapt their responses depending on the statistical structure of the sensory environment. Contrast gain control is a form of adaptation in the auditory cortex, but it is unclear whether the dynamics of gain control reflect efficient adaptation, and whether they shape behavioral perception. Here, we trained mice to detect a target presented in background noise shortly after a change in the contrast of the background. The observed changes in cortical gain and behavioral detection followed the dynamics of a normative model of efficient contrast gain control; specifically, target detection and sensitivity improved slowly in low contrast, but degraded rapidly in high contrast. Auditory cortex was required for this task, and cortical responses were not only similarly affected by contrast but predicted variability in behavioral performance. Combined, our results demonstrate that dynamic gain adaptation supports efficient coding in auditory cortex and predicts the perception of sounds in noise.",

    "abstract": "Intra-thymic T cell development is coordinated by the regulatory actions of SATB1 genome organizer. In this report, we show that SATB1 is involved in the regulation of transcription and splicing, both of which displayed deregulation in Satb1 knockout murine thymocytes. More importantly, we characterized a novel SATB1 protein isoform and described its distinct biophysical behavior, implicating potential functional differences compared to the commonly studied isoform. SATB1 utilized its prion-like domains to transition through liquid-like states to aggregated structures. This behavior was dependent on protein concentration as well as phosphorylation and interaction with nuclear RNA. Notably, the long SATB1 isoform was more prone to aggregate following phase separation. Thus, the tight regulation of SATB1 isoforms expression levels alongside with protein post-translational modifications, are imperative for SATB1s mode of action in T cell development. Our data indicate that deregulation of these processes may also be linked to disorders such as cancer.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundYolk sac (YS) progenitors are a source of macrophages and endothelial cells in some tissues that are thought to be maintained postnatally by self-renewal in their differentiated states. How this is achieved remains poorly understood.\n\nMethods and ResultsSingle-cell digests from mouse aortas selectively formed macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-M) in methylcellulose, which self-renewed in secondary cultures from single cells. CFU-M comprised a homogeneous population of Lin-CD45+/LoCD11b- F4/80-Sca-1+c-Kit+ progenitor cells that co-expressed fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) and colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R). These progenitors displayed high proliferative activity from adult aorta even at steady state. Flt3Cre lineage mapping revealed their independence from Flt3+ bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells. They were especially abundant in neonatal aorta, with subsequent age-related decline, suggesting prenatal seeding, which was confirmed by finding their emergence in YS after embryonic day (E) 7.5 and from aorta-gonad-mesonephros by E10.5. Inducible fate-mapping using Csf1rMer-iCre-Mer and Cx3cr1YFP-creER mice established that these progenitors originate from an E8.5 CSF1R+ and E8.5-9.5 CX3CR1+ source, together with macrophages and endothelial cells in the aortic wall. Complementary differentiation studies revealed aortic progenitors to be vasculogenic and bipotent for macrophages and endothelium, contributing to adventitial neovascularization in aortic ring assays and forming perfused blood vessels and macrophages after transfer into ischemic hindlimb. Single-cell RNA sequencing showed their relatively homogeneous myelopoietic and angiogenic gene expression profile without expression of mature myeloid or endothelial genes. Finally, we found that aortic progenitors also express angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin II receptor, AGTR2, and established regulatory roles for angiotensin II, which augmented their proliferative, self-renewal and differentiation properties in vitro and expansion in aorta in vivo.\n\nConclusionOur discovery of aortic endothelial-macrophage progenitors adds to the recognized fate of YS progenitors in postnatal tissues. These bipotent cells may help explain the local renewal of YS-derived tissue-resident macrophages and endothelial cells after birth.",

    "abstract": "The prevalent  core phonological deficit model of dyslexia proposes that the reading and spelling difficulties characterizing affected children stem from prior developmental difficulties in processing speech sound structure, for example perceiving and identifying syllable stress patterns, syllables, rhymes and phonemes. Yet spoken word production appears normal. This suggests an unexpected disconnect between speech input and speech output processes. Here we investigated the output side of this disconnect from a speech rhythm perspective by measuring the speech amplitude envelope (AE) of multisyllabic spoken phrases. The speech AE contains crucial information regarding stress patterns, speech rate, tonal contrasts and intonational information. We created a novel computerized speech copying task in which participants copied aloud familiar spoken targets like \"Aladdin\". Seventy-five children with and without dyslexia were tested, some of whom were also receiving an oral intervention designed to enhance multi-syllabic processing. Similarity of the childs productions to the target AE was computed using correlation and mutual information metrics. Similarity of pitch contour, another acoustic cue to speech rhythm, was used for control analyses. Children with dyslexia were significantly worse at producing the multi-syllabic targets as indexed by both similarity metrics for computing the AE. However, children with dyslexia were not different from control children in producing pitch contours. Accordingly, the spoken production of multisyllabic phrases by children with dyslexia is atypical regarding the AE. Children with dyslexia may not appear to listeners to exhibit speech production difficulties because their pitch contours are intact.\n\nResearch HighlightsO_LISpeech production of syllable stress patterns is atypical in children with dyslexia.\nC_LIO_LIChildren with dyslexia are significantly worse at producing the amplitude envelope of multi-syllabic targets compared to both age-matched and reading-level-matched control children.\nC_LIO_LINo group differences were found for pitch contour production between children with dyslexia and age-matched control children.\nC_LIO_LIIt may be difficult to detect speech output problems in dyslexia as pitch contours are relatively accurate.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The collective migration of keratinocytes during wound healing requires both the generation and transmission of mechanical forces for individual cellular locomotion and the coordination of movement across cells. Leader cells along the wound edge transmit mechanical and biochemical cues to ensuing follower cells, ensuring their coordinated direction of migration across multiple cells, or directionality. Despite the observed importance of mechanical cues in leader cell formation and controlling directionality, the underlying biophysical mechanisms remain elusive. The mechanically-activated ion channel PIEZO1 was recently identified to play an inhibitory role during the reepithelialization of wounds. Here, through an integrative experimental and mathematical modeling approach, we elucidate PIEZO1s contributions to collective migration. Time-lapse microscopy reveals that PIEZO1 activity inhibits leader cell formation along the wound edge. To probe the relationship between PIEZO1 activity, leader cell formation and inhibition of reepithelialization, we developed an integrative 2D-multiscale model of wound closure that links observations at the single cell and collective cell migration scales. Through numerical simulations and subsequent experimental validation, we found that directionality plays a key role during wound closure and is inhibited by upregulated PIEZO1 activity. We propose that PIEZO1-mediated retraction suppresses leader cell formation which inhibits coordination of directionality between cells during collective migration.",

    "abstract": "Predicting phenotypes from genotypes is a fundamental task in quantitative genetics. With technological advances, it is now possible to measure multiple phenotypes in large samples. Multiple phenotypes can share their genetic component; therefore, modeling these phenotypes jointly may improve prediction accuracy by leveraging effects that are shared across phenotypes. However, effects can be shared across phenotypes in a variety of ways, so computationally efficient statistical methods are needed that can accurately and flexibly capture patterns of effect sharing. Here, we describe new Bayesian multivariate, multiple regression methods that, by using flexible priors, are able to model and adapt to different patterns of effect sharing and specificity across phenotypes. Simulation results show that these new methods are fast and improve prediction accuracy compared with existing methods in a wide range of settings where effects are shared. Further, in settings where effects are not shared, our methods still perform competitively with state-of-the-art methods. In real data analyses of expression data in the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, our methods improve prediction performance on average for all tissues, with the greatest gains in tissues where effects are strongly shared, and in the tissues with smaller sample sizes. While we use gene expression prediction to illustrate our methods, the methods are generally applicable to any multi-phenotype applications, including prediction of polygenic scores and breeding values. Thus, our methods have the potential to provide improvements across fields and organisms.\n\nAuthor summaryPredicting phenotypes from genotypes is a fundamental problem in quantitative genetics. Thanks to recent advances, it is increasingly feasible to collect data on many phenotypes and genome-wide genotypes in large samples. Here, we tackle the problem of predicting multiple phenotypes from genotypes using a new method based on a multivariate, multiple linear regression model. Although the use of a multivariate, multiple linear regression model is not new, in this paper we introduce a flexible and computationally efficient empirical Bayes approach based on this model. This approach uses a prior that captures how the effects of genotypes on phenotypes are shared across the different phenotypes, and then the prior is adapted to the data in order to capture the most prominent sharing patterns present in the data. We assess the benefits of this flexible Bayesian approach in simulated genetic data sets, and we illustrate its application in predicting gene expression measured in multiple human tissues. We show that our methods can outperform competing methods in terms of prediction accuracy, and the computations involved in fitting the model and making the predictions scale well to large data sets.",

    "abstract": "Preterm birth (PTB) is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. The vaginal microbiome has been associated with PTB, yet the mechanisms underlying this association are not fully understood. Understanding microbial genetic adaptations to selective pressures, especially those related to the host, may yield new insights into these associations. To this end, we analyzed metagenomic data from 705 vaginal samples collected longitudinally during pregnancy from 40 women who delivered preterm spontaneously and 135 term controls from the Multi-Omic Microbiome Study-Pregnancy Initiative (MOMS-PI1). We find that the vaginal microbiome of pregnancies that ended preterm exhibits unique genetic profiles. It is more genetically diverse at the species level, a result which we validate in an additional cohort, and harbors a higher richness and diversity of antimicrobial resistance genes, likely promoted by transduction. Interestingly, we find that Gardnerella species, a group of central vaginal pathobionts, are driving this higher genetic diversity, particularly during the first half of the pregnancy. We further present evidence that Gardnerella spp. undergoes more frequent recombination and stronger purifying selection in genes involved in lipid metabolism. Overall, our results reveal novel associations between the vaginal microbiome and PTB using population genetics analyses, and suggest that evolutionary processes acting on the vaginal microbiome may play a vital role in adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth.",

There are indications that both receptors interact functionally and physically, but the precise role of this interdependence is poorly understood. Here, we analyzed the impact of GR co-expression on MR genome-wide chromatin binding and transcriptional responses to aldosterone and glucocorticoids, both physiological ligands of this receptor. Our data show that GR co-expression alters MR genome-wide binding to consensus DNA sequences in a locus-and ligand-specific way. MR binding to consensus DNA sequences is affected by GR. Transcriptional responses of MR in the absence of GR are weak and show poor correlation with chromatin binding. In contrast, co-expression of GR potentiates MR-mediated transcription, particularly in response to aldosterone. Finally, single-molecule tracking of MR suggests that the presence of GR contributes to productive binding of MR/aldosterone complexes to chromatin. Together, our data indicate that co-expression of GR potentiates aldosterone-mediated MR transcriptional activity, even in the absence of glucocorticoids.",

    "abstract": "The WASH1 gene produces a protein that forms part of the developmentally important WASH complex. The WASH complex activates the Arp2/3 complex to initiate branched actin networks at the surface of endosomes. As a curiosity, the human reference gene set includes nine WASH1 genes. How many of these are pseudogenes and how many are bona fide coding genes is not clear.\n\nEight of the nine WASH1 genes reside in rearrangement and duplication-prone subtelomeric regions. Many of these subtelomeric regions had gaps in the GRCh38 human genome assembly, but the recently published T2T-CHM13 assembly from the Telomere to Telomere (T2T) Consortium has filled in the gaps. As a result, the T2T Consortium has added four new WASH1 paralogues in previously unannotated subtelomeric regions.\n\nHere we show that one of these four novel WASH1 genes, LOC124908094, is the gene most likely to produce the functional WASH1 protein. We also demonstrate that the other twelve WASH1 genes derived from a single WASH8P pseudogene on chromosome 12. These 12 genes include WASHC1, the gene currently annotated as the functional WASH1 gene.\n\nWe propose LOC124908094 should be annotated as a coding gene and all functional information relating to the WASHC1 gene on chromosome 9 should be transferred to LOC124908094. The remaining WASH1 genes, including WASHC1, should be annotated as pseudogenes. This work confirms that the T2T assembly has added at least one functionally relevant coding gene to the human reference set. It remains to be seen whether other important coding genes are missing from the GRCh38 reference assembly.",

We demonstrate that a cohort of hiPSC lines from different donors can be screened efficiently in their pluripotent state using high-throughput cell painting assays, allowing detection of variable phenotypic responses to a wide range of clinically approved drugs, across multiple disease areas. Furthermore, we provide information on mechanisms of drug-cell interactions underlying the observed variable responses by using quantitative proteomic analysis to compare sets of hiPSC lines that had been stratified objectively using cell painting data.

Specifically, the aged alveolar epithelial cells, including both alveolar type II (AT2) and type I (AT1) cells, demonstrate loss of epithelial identities, heightened inflammaging characterized by increased expression of AP-1 transcription factor and chemokine genes, and significantly increased cellular senescence. Furthermore, the aged mesenchymal cells display a remarkable decrease in Collagen and Elastin transcription. The decline of the AT2 niche is further exacerbated by a weakened endothelial cell phenotype and a dysregulated genetic program in macrophages. These findings highlight the dysregulation observed in both AT2 stem cells and their supportive niche cells, potentially contributing to the increased susceptibility of aged populations to lung diseases.",

    "abstract": "-Helical coiled coils are common tertiary and quaternary elements of protein structure. In coiled coils, two or more  helices wrapped around each other to form bundles. This apparently simple structural motif can generate many architectures and topologies. Understanding the variety of and limits on coiled-coil assemblies and their sequence-to-structure relationships impacts on protein structure, design, and engineering. Coiled coil-forming sequences can be predicted from heptad repeats of hydrophobic and polar residues, hpphppp, although this is not always reliable. Alternatively, coiled-coil structures can be identified using the program SOCKET, which finds knobs-into-holes (KIH) packing between side chains of neighboring helices. SOCKET also classifies coiled-coil architecture and topology, thus allowing sequence-to-structure relationships to be garnered. In 2009, we used SOCKET to create a relational database of coiled-coil structures, CC+, from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB). Here we report an update of CC+ following the recent explosion of structural data and the success of AlphaFold2 in predicting protein structures from genome sequences. With the most-stringent SOCKET parameters, CC+ contains {approx}12,000 coiled-coil assemblies from experimentally determined structures, and {approx}120,000 potential coiled-coil structures within single-chain models predicted by AlphaFold2 across 48 proteomes. CC+ allows these and other less-stringently defined coiled coils to be searched at various levels of structure, sequence, and side-chain interactions. The identified coiled coils can be viewed directly from CC+ using the Socket2 application, and their associated data can be downloaded for further analyses. CC+ is available freely at http://coiledcoils.chm.bris.ac.uk/CCPlus/Home.html. It will be regularly updated automatically.\n\nFOR THE BROADER AUDIENCEProtein assemblies and protein-protein interactions are key to all biological processes. -Helical coiled coils are one of the most common modes of directing and stabilising these interfaces. Here, we report an updated CC+ database of structurally validated coiled coils from experimental protein structures and AlphaFold2 models. CC+ contains many thousands of coiled-coil structures and models, associated parameters, and sequences. It enables the compilation of rich datasets for advancing protein structure, design, and engineering research.",

Comparative structures, mutant recordings, and molecular simulations with and without GABA further explained the sensitized but slower activation of {rho}1 relative to canonical subtypes. Combining GABA with picrotoxin also captured an apparent uncoupled intermediate state.

    "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by HLA class I-mediated presentation of autoantigens on the surface of pancreatic {beta}-cells. Recognition of these autoantigens by CD8+ T cells results in the destruction of pancreatic {beta}-cells and, consequently, insulin deficiency. Most epitopes presented at the surface of {beta}-cells derive from the insulin precursor molecule proinsulin. The intracellular processing pathway(s) involved in the generation of these peptides are poorly defined. In this study, we show that a proinsulin B-chain antigen (PPIB5-14) originates from proinsulin molecules that are processed by ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) and thus originate from ER-resident proteins. Furthermore, screening genes encoding for E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes, we identified UBE2G2 to be involved in proinsulin degradation. These results indicate that insulin-derived peptides, presented by HLA-class I molecules at the cell surface, originate from ER-resident proinsulin that has been dislocated to the cytosol for subsequent degradation. These insights into the pathway involved in the generation of insulin-derived peptides emphasize the importance of proinsulin processing in the ER to T1D pathogenesis and identify novel targets for future therapies that may cure or even prevent T1D.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=172 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/545333v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (51K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@131d5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6eb4b3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@196674org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1957af6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The adaptive immune response eliminates infected and cancer cells through the recognition of antigenic peptides displayed by major compatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules1, 2. A single transporter, the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), supplies nearly the entire peptide repertoire for the many MHC-I alleles3-5. A fundamental unresolved question is how TAP transports peptides with vast sequence diversity. Here, using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we determined seven structures of human TAP in the presence and absence of peptides with different sequences and lengths. We observe that peptides are suspended in the transmembrane cavity of TAP with the peptide N-and C-termini anchored at two distal binding pockets. The central residues of the peptide are unrestricted, making few contacts with TAP. A minimum of eight residues is required to bridge the two binding pockets, aligning with the lower length limit for MHC-I binding6, 7. Mutations in TAP that disrupt hydrogen bonds with the peptide termini nearly abolish MHC-I surface expression, indicating that binding depends on interactions with mainchain atoms at the two termini. By utilizing two spatially separated binding pockets and concentrating interactions at the two ends of the peptide, TAP functions as a molecular caliper, selecting peptides for length while permitting sequence diversity.",

    "abstract": "The yeast mating response uses a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), Ste2, to detect mating pheromone and initiate mating projection morphogenesis. The septin cytoskeleton plays a key role in the formation of the mating projection, forming structures at the base of the projection. Desensitization of the G, Gpa1, by the Regulator of G-protein Signaling (RGS), Sst2, is required for proper septin organization and morphogenesis. In cells where the G is hyperactive, septins are mislocalized to the site of polarity, and the cells are unable to track a pheromone gradient. We set out to identify the proteins that mediate G control of septins during the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mating response by making mutations to rescue septin localization in cells expressing the hyperactive G mutant gpa1G302S. We found that single deletions of the septin chaperone Gic1, the Cdc42 GAP Bem3, and the epsins Ent1 and Ent2 rescued the polar cap accumulation of septins in the hyperactive G. We created an agent based model of vesicle trafficking that predicts how changes in endocytic cargo licensing alters localization of endocytosis that mirrors the septin localization we see experimentally. We hypothesized that hyperactive G may increase the rate of endocytosis of a pheromone responsive cargo, thereby altering where septins are localized. Both the GPCR and the G are known to be internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis during the pheromone response. Deletion of the GPCR C-terminus to block internalization partially rescued septin organization. However, deletion of the Gpa1 ubiquitination domain required for its endocytosis completely abrogated septin accumulation at the polarity site. Our data support a model where the location of endocytosis serves as a spatial mark for septin structure assembly and that desensitization of the G delays its endocytosis sufficiently that septins are placed peripheral to the site of Cdc42 polarity.",

    "abstract": "Notch signaling activity regulates hematopoiesis in Drosophila and vertebrates alike. Parasitoid wasp infestation of Drosophila larvae, however, requires a rapid downregulation of Notch activity to allow the formation of encapsulation-active blood cells. Here we show that the Drosophila CSL transcription factor Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)] is phosphorylated at Serine 269 in response to parasitoid wasp infestation. As this phosphorylation interferes with the DNA-binding of Su(H), it reversibly inhibits Notch activity. Accordingly, phospho-deficient Su(H)S269A mutants are immune compromised. A screen for kinases involved in Su(H) phosphorylation identified Pkc53E, required for normal hematopoiesis as well as for parasitoid immune response. Genetic and molecular interactions support the specificity of the Su(H)-Pkc53E relationship. Moreover, phorbol ester treatment inhibits Su(H) activity in vivo and in human cell culture. We conclude that Pkc53E targets Su(H) during parasitic wasp infestation, inducing downregulation of Notch activity, thereby remodeling the blood cell population required for wasp egg encapsulation.",

    "abstract": "A hallmark of age-associated neurodegenerative diseases is the aggregation of proteins. Aggregation of the protein tau defines tauopathies, which include Alzheimers disease and frontotemporal dementia. Specific neuronal subtypes are selectively vulnerable to the accumulation of tau aggregates, and subsequent dysfunction and death. The mechanisms underlying cell type-selective vulnerability are unknown. To systematically uncover the cellular factors controlling the accumulation of tau aggregates in human neurons, we conducted a genome-wide CRISPRi-based modifier screen in iPSC-derived neurons. The screen uncovered expected pathways, including autophagy, but also unexpected pathways including UFMylation and GPI anchor synthesis, that control tau oligomer levels. We identify the E3 ubiquitin ligase CUL5 as a tau interactor and potent modifier of tau levels. In addition, disruption of mitochondrial function increases tau oligomer levels and promotes proteasomal misprocessing of tau. These results reveal new principles of tau proteostasis in human neurons and pinpoint potential therapeutic targets for tauopathies.",

Our approach leverages Dynamic Differential Covariance to address the associated computational challenges. First, we analyze spike trains generated from Leaky Integrate-and-Fire network simulations and evaluate the performance of several off-the-shelf multivariate connectivity inference methods. Next, we introduce a new approach, Fractional Dynamic Differential Covariance (FDDC), and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms the other methods. Finally, we apply FDDC to experimental data to assess the topological organization of inferred graphs of in vitro neural network recordings obtained using high-density microelectrode arrays (HD-MEAs). Our results indicate that FDDC-derived graphs exhibit a significant negative correlation between small-worldness and measures of network synchrony. In contrast, graphs inferred through the well-established pairwise correlation method do not show such a correlation. This finding implies that the graphs obtained through FDDC provide stronger evidence in support of the theoretical notion that networks with clustered connections tend to exhibit higher levels of synchronizability.

While TCR sensitivity was greatly enhanced by CD2 ligand, CAR sensitivity to CD19 was primarily but more modestly enhanced by LFA-1 ligand.

Although trace metals are common contaminants in wastewater, the quantitative effects of trace metals on AMR in wastewater settings remain understudied. We experimentally determined the interactions between common antibiotic residues and metal ions found in wastewater and investigated their effects on the development of antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli over time. These data were then used to expand on a previously developed computational model of antibiotic resistance development in continuous flow settings to incorporate the effects of trace metals acting in combination with multiple antibiotic residues. We found that the common metal ions, copper and iron, interact with both ciprofloxacin and doxycycline at wastewater relevant concentrations. This can significantly affect resistance development due to antibiotic chelation of the metal ions causing a reduction in the antibiotics bioactivity. Furthermore, modeling the effect of these interactions in wastewater systems showed the potential for metal ions in wastewater to significantly increase the development of antibiotic resistant E. coli populations. These results demonstrate the need to quantitatively understand the effects of trace metal-antibiotic interactions on AMR development in wastewater.",

    "abstract": "ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTs) mediate the transfer of ADP-ribose from NAD+ to protein or nucleic acid substrates. This modification can be removed by several different types of proteins, including macrodomains. Several ARTs, also known as PARPs, are stimulated by interferon, indicating ADP-ribosylation is an important aspect of the innate immune response. All coronaviruses (CoVs) encode for a highly conserved macrodomain (Mac1) that is critical for CoVs to replicate and cause disease, indicating that ADP-ribosylation can effectively control coronavirus infection. Our siRNA screen indicated that PARP12 might inhibit the replication of a MHV Mac1 mutant virus in bone-marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs). To conclusively demonstrate that PARP12 is a key mediator of the antiviral response to CoVs both in cell culture and in vivo, we produced PARP12-/- mice and tested the ability of MHV A59 (hepatotropic/neurotropic) and JHM (neurotropic) Mac1 mutant viruses to replicate and cause disease in these mice. Notably, in the absence of PARP12, Mac1 mutant replication was increased in BMDMs and in mice. In addition, liver pathology was also increased in A59 infected mice. However, the PARP12 knockout did not restore Mac1 mutant virus replication to WT virus levels in all cell or tissue types and did not significantly increase the lethality of Mac1 mutant viruses. These results demonstrate that while PARP12 inhibits MHV Mac1 mutant virus infection, additional PARPs or innate immune factors must contribute to the extreme attenuation of this virus in mice.\n\nIMPORTANCEOver the last decade, the importance of ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTs), also known as PARPs, in the antiviral response has gained increased significance as several were shown to either restrict virus replication or impact innate immune responses. However, there are few studies showing ART-mediated inhibition of virus replication or pathogenesis in animal models. We found that the CoV macrodomain (Mac1) was required to prevent ART-mediated inhibition of virus replication in cell culture. Here, using knockout mice, we found that PARP12, an interferon-stimulated ART, was required to repress the replication of a Mac1 mutant CoV both in cell culture and in mice, demonstrating that PARP12 represses coronavirus replication. However, the deletion of PARP12 did not fully rescue Mac1 mutant virus replication or pathogenesis, indicating that multiple PARPs function to counter coronavirus infection.",

Importantly, the carbobicyclic core structure is critical for the potent antiviral efficacy, thus opening up ample opportunities for further lead optimization and mechanistic investigations.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=108 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/545395v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fbd078org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3399a9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ad5fcborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16c2f3d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Accurate assessments of vector occurrence and abundance, particularly in widespread vector-borne diseases such as malaria, is essential for efficient deployment of disease surveillance and control interventions. This study emphasizes the need for flexible spatial sampling designs that can capture the dynamic relationships between disease vector species and the environment. Although previous studies have examined the benefits of adaptive sampling for disease hotspot identification (mostly by simulations), limited research has been conducted on field surveillance of malaria vectors. Here, an adaptive spatial sampling design targeting potential and uncertain An. gambiae hotspots, a major malaria vector in sub-Saharan Africa, is presented. The first phase of the proposed design involved ecological zone delineation and a proportional lattice with close pairs sampling design to maximise spatial coverage, representativeness of ecological zones and vector spatial autocorrelation (by the employment of close pairs). In the second phase, a spatial adaptive sampling design targeted high-risk areas with the largest uncertainty. For the second phase, the sample size was reduced compared to the first phase, but predictions improved for out-of-sample and training data. However, the overall model uncertainty increased, highlighting the trade-off in multi-criteria adaptive sampling designs. It is important that future research focuses on these trade-offs to reduce the timescale for effective malaria control and elimination efforts.",

Here, we show deposition of one RNA modification-N2-methylguanosine (m2G)-on the G72 nucleoside of U6 snRNA (known to function as the catalytic center of the spliceosome) results in profoundly increased pre-mRNA splicing activity in human cells. This U6 m2G72 modification is conserved among vertebrates. Further, we demonstrate that THUMPD2 is the methyltransferase responsible for U6 m2G72 and show that it interacts with an auxiliary protein (TRMT112) to specifically recognize both sequence and structural elements of U6. THUMPD2 KO blocks U6 m2G72 and down-regulates the pre-mRNA splicing activity of major spliceosome, yielding thousands of changed alternative splicing events of endogenous pre-mRNAs. Notably, the aberrantly spliced pre-mRNA population of the THUMPD2 KO cells elicits the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway and restricts cell proliferation. Our study thus demonstrates how an RNA epigenetic modification of the major spliceosome differentially regulates global pre-mRNA splicing.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquitously expressed adaptor protein Growth factor receptor bound protein 2 (Grb2) plays an essential role in signal transduction by binding to activated receptor tyrosine kinases through its SH2 domain and to downstream effectors via its N- and C-terminal SH3 domains (nSH3, cSH3). Here we present the first structure of ligand-bound full length Grb2. The crystal structure of Grb2 in complex with a bidentate nSH3-cSH3-binding peptide, derived from the multi-site docking protein Grb2- associated binder-1 (Gab1), provides molecular insight into effector recognition by Grb2 and reveals the assembly of a two-dimensional meshwork, consisting of multimeric filament-like Grb2 chains linked to each other by the bivalent bound Gab1497-528 peptide. Dominant contacts between Grb2 molecules in the multimer are provided by an intermolecular SH2/cSH3 domain interface that is also present in the closed dimer of ligand-free Grb2. We further show that Grb2 is able to self-assemble to form phase-separated condensates in solution. The Grb2 SH2 domain phosphotyrosine binding site is freely accessible in the multimeric assembly, and phase separation is fostered by addition of Gab1497- 528, as expected from the crystal structure. Multimeric assembly is also observed using a Grb2 SH2- cSH3 didomain construct, and suppressed using a Grb2 Tyr60Glu mutant, a mimic of the in vivo phosphorylated Tyr160 central to the SH2/cSH3 interface, demonstrating that an intact SH2/cSH3 interface is needed for Grb2 assembly in solution.",

It is a highly dynamic structure and transitions between two stacked isomers through an intermediate open conformer. In a constrained cellular environment, HJ is expected to behave differently than in vitro. This can affect target recognition by junction-binding proteins and their subsequent functions. However, the studies on the effect of the confined environment on HJ is extremely scanty. In this work, by employing fluorescence-based techniques we investigated the effect of confinement on HJ conformation using reverse micelle encapsulation as a model for confined space. We observed that inside reverse micelle, HJ prefers to adopt stacked conformation. Most strikingly, even at lower divalent cation concentrations, the preference for stacked conformation is prevalent over an open conformation. Our finding suggests that such confinement-induced changes in the conformer population might affect the interaction and activity of the HJ-recognizing proteins in the cellular environment.",

    "abstract": "The genomes of most mesophilic organisms encode multiple ATP-Binding Cassette F (ABCF) proteins. EttA, one of four E. coli paralogs, regulates synthesis of the first peptide bond on the ribosome dependent on ATP/ADP ratio, while Antibiotic Resistance factors (AREs), paralogs in other organisms, both regulate and directly mediate resistance to ribosome-targeted antibiotics. However, the physiological functions remain unclear for most paralogs, and the mechanism-of-action has yet to be rigorously established for any paralog. We herein present single particle cryogenic electron microscopy structures of ribosome complexes of all four E. coli ABCF paralogs (EttA, Uup, YbiT, and YheS), which, together with previously determined ARE structures, show that ABCFs control the binding geometry of the tRNA in the peptidyl-tRNA-binding (P) site on the ribosome. They modulate the position of its acceptor stem relative to the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) in a manner that can either promote (EttA and Uup) or disrupt (YbiT, YheS, and the AREs) proper catalytic geometry. The YbiT/70S reconstructions include a conformation with no density for ribosomal protein bL33, and structural analyses support the exchange of this sub-stoichiometric ribosomal protein being functionally related to conformational changes in YbiT controlled by sequence variations in the strongly non-canonical Signature Sequence in its first ABC domain. Our studies establish general structural/enzymological principles by which the ATPase activity of ABCF proteins controls translation elongation coupled to modulation of conformation and stereochemistry in the catalytic core of the ribosome.",

Two types of cells within the heart pacemaker, sinoatrial node (SAN), and within the left ventricle (LV) control two crucial characteristics of heart function, heart beat rate and contraction strength. As age advances, the hearts structure becomes remodeled, and SAN and LV cell functions deteriorate, thus increasing the risk for CVDs. However, the different molecular features of age-associated changes in SAN and LV cells have never been compared in omics scale in the context of aging. We applied deep RNA sequencing to four groups of samples, young LV, old LV, young SAN and old SAN, followed by numerous bioinformatic analyses. In addition to profiling the differences in gene expression patterns between the two heart chambers (LV vs. SAN), we also identified the chamber-specific concordant or discordant age-associated changes in: (1) genes linked to energy production related to cardiomyocyte contraction, (2) genes related to post-transcriptional processing, (3) genes involved in KEGG longevity regulating pathway, (4) prolongevity and antilongevity genes recorded and curated in the GenAge database, and (5) CVD marker genes. Our bioinformatic analysis also predicted the regulation activities and mapped the expression of upstream regulators including transcription regulators and post-transcriptional regulator miRNAs. This comprehensive analysis promotes our understanding of regulation of heart functions and will enable discovery of gene-specific therapeutic targets of CVDs in advanced age.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDeveloping neurons have high thyroid hormone and iron requirements to support their metabolism and growth. Early-life iron and thyroid hormone deficiencies are prevalent, often coexist, and increase the risk of permanently impaired neurobehavioral function in children. Early-life dietary iron deficiency reduces thyroid hormone levels and impairs thyroid hormone-responsive gene expression in the neonatal rat brain.\n\nObjectiveThis study determined whether neuronal-specific iron deficiency alters thyroid hormone-regulated gene expression in developing neurons.\n\nMethodsIron deficiency was induced in primary mouse embryonic hippocampal neuron cultures with the iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO) beginning at 3 days in vitro (DIV). At 11DIV and 18DIV, mRNA levels for thyroid hormone-regulated genes indexing thyroid hormone homeostasis (Hr, Crym, Dio2, Slco1c1, Slc16a2) and neurodevelopment (Nrgn, Pvalb, Klf9) were quantified. To assess the effect of iron repletion, DFO was removed at 14DIV from a subset of DFO-treated cultures and gene expression and ATP levels were quantified at 21DIV.\n\nResultsAt 11DIV and 18DIV, neuronal iron deficiency decreased Nrgn, Pvalb, and Crym, and by 18DIV, Slc16a2, Slco1c1, Dio2, and Hr were increased; collectively suggesting cellular sensing of a functionally abnormal thyroid hormone state. Dimensionality reduction with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reveals that thyroid hormone homeostatic genes strongly correlate with and predict iron status (Tfr1 mRNA). Iron repletion from 14-21DIV restored neurodevelopmental genes, but not all thyroid hormone homeostatic genes, and ATP concentrations remained significantly altered. PCA clustering suggests that cultures replete with iron maintain a gene expression signature indicative of previous iron deficiency.\n\nConclusionsThese novel findings suggest there is an intracellular mechanism coordinating cellular iron/thyroid hormone activities. We speculate this is a part of homeostatic response to match neuronal energy production and growth signaling for these important metabolic regulators. However, iron deficiency may cause permanent deficits in thyroid hormone-dependent neurodevelopmental processes even after recovery from iron deficiency.",

    "abstract": "Rewards are a broad category of stimuli inducing approach behavior to aid survival. Extensive evidence from animal research has shown that wanting (the motivation to pursue a reward) and liking (the pleasure associated with its consumption) are mostly regulated by dopaminergic and opioidergic activity in dedicated brain areas. However, less is known about the neuroanatomy of dopaminergic and opioidergic regulation of reward processing in humans, especially when considering different types of rewards (i.e., social and non-social). To fill this gap of knowledge, we combined dopaminergic and opioidergic antagonism (via amisulpride and naltrexone administration) with functional neuroimaging to investigate the neurochemical and neuroanatomical bases of wanting and liking of matched non-social (food) and social (interpersonal touch) rewards, using a randomized, between-subject, placebo-controlled, double-blind design. While at the behavioral level no drug effect was observed, brain activity was modulated by the administered compounds. In particular, opioid antagonism, compared to placebo, was associated with reduced activity in the medial orbitofrontal cortex during consumption of the most valued social and non-social rewards. Dopamine antagonism, however, had no clear effects on brain activity in response to rewards anticipation. These findings provide insights into the neurobiology of human reward processing and suggest a similar opioidergic regulation of the neural responses to social and non-social reward consumption.",

Use of Clustered Regularly Interspersed Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 induced targeted DNA double-strand breakage has substantially simplified use of homology-directed repair to introduce specific perturbations in Drosophila, but existing platforms for CRISPR-Cas9-mediated HDR in Drosophila involve multiple cloning steps and have low efficiency. To simplify cloning of HDR plasmids, we designed a new plasmid platform, the Janelia Atalanta (pJAT) series, that exploits recent advances in dsDNA synthesis to facilitate Gateway cloning of gRNA sequences and homology arms in one step. Surprisingly, the pJAT plasmids yielded considerably higher HDR efficiency (approximately 25%) than we have observed with other approaches. pJAT plasmids work in multiple Drosophila species and exhibited such high efficiency that previously impossible experiments in Drosophila, such as driving targeted chromosomal inversions, were made possible. We provide pJAT plasmids for a range of commonly performed experiments including targeted insertional mutagenesis, insertion of phiC31-mediated attP landing sites, generation of strains carrying a germ-line source of Cas9, and induction of chromosomal rearrangements. We also provide \"empty\" pJAT plasmids with multiple cloning sites to simplify construction of plasmids with new functionality.

    "abstract": "The World Health Organization recently published the first list of priority fungal pathogens highlighting multiple Candida species including C. glabrata, C. albicans, and C. auris. The use of CRISPR-Cas9 and auxotrophic C. glabrata and C. albicans strains have been instrumental in the study of these fungal pathogens. Dominant drug resistance cassettes are also critical for genetic manipulation and eliminate the concern of altered virulence when using auxotrophic strains. However, genetic manipulation has been mainly limited to the use of two drug resistance cassettes, NatMX and HphMX. Using an in vitro assembled CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-based system and 130-150 bp homology regions for directed repair, we expand the drug resistance cassettes for Candida to include KanMX and BleMX, commonly used in S. cerevisiae. As a proof of principle, we demonstrated efficient deletion of ERG genes using KanMX and BleMX. We also showed the utility of the CRISPR-Cas9 RNP system for generating double deletions of genes in the ergosterol pathway and endogenous epitope tagging of ERG genes using an existing KanMX cassette. This indicates that CRISPR-Cas9 RNP can be used to repurpose the S. cerevisiae toolkit. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this method is effective at deleting ERG3 in C. auris using a codon optimized BleMX cassette and effective at deleting the epigenetic factor, SET1, in C. albicans using a recyclable SAT1. Using this expanded toolkit, we discovered new insights into fungal biology and drug resistance.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe increasing problem of drug resistance and emerging pathogens is an urgent global health problem that necessitates the development and expansion of tools for studying fungal drug resistance and pathogenesis.

Our approach is robust and efficient for making gene deletions in C. glabrata, C. auris and C. albicans as well as epitope tagging in C. glabrata. Furthermore, we demonstrated that KanMX and BleMX drug resistance cassettes can be repurposed in C. glabrata and BleMX in C. auris.

    "abstract": "Malate (2-hydroxysuccinic acid) and tartrate (2,3-dihydroxysuccinic acid) are chiral substrates; the former existing in two enantiomeric forms (R and S) while the latter exists as three stereoisomers (R,R; S,S; and R,S). Dehydration by stereospecific hydrogen abstraction and anti- elimination of the hydroxyl group yield the achiral products fumarate and oxaloacetate, respectively. Class-I fumarate hydratase (FH) and L-tartrate dehydratase (L-TTD) are two highly conserved enzymes belonging to the iron-sulfur cluster hydrolyase family of enzymes that catalyze reactions on specific stereoisomers of malate and tartrate. FH from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii accepts only S-malate and S,S-tartrate as substrates while the structurally similar L-TTD from Escherichia coli accepts only R-malate and R,R-tartrate as substrates. Phylogenetic analysis reveals a common evolutionary origin of L-TTDs and two-subunit archaeal FHs suggesting a divergence during evolution that may have led to the switch in substrate stereospecificity preference. Due to the high conservation of their sequences, a molecular basis for switch in stereospecificity is not evident from analysis of crystal structures of FH and predicted structure of L-TTD. The switch in enantiomer preference may be rationalised by invoking conformational plasticity of the amino acids interacting with the substrate, together with substrate reorientation and conformer selection about the C2-C3 bond of the dicarboxylic acid substrates. Although classical models of enzyme-substrate binding are insufficient to explain such a phenomenon, the enantiomer superposition model suggests that a minor reorientation in the active site residues could lead to the switch in substrate stereospecificity.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrial calcium uniporter (mtCU) is a multicomponent Ca2+-specific channel that imparts mitochondria with the capacity to sense the cytosolic calcium signals. The metazoan mtCU comprises the pore-forming subunit MCU and the essential regulator EMRE, arranged in a tetrameric channel complex, and the Ca2+ sensing peripheral proteins MICU1-3. The mechanism of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake by mtCU and its regulation is poorly understood. Our analysis of MCU structure and sequence conservation, combined with molecular dynamics simulations, mutagenesis, and functional studies, led us to conclude that the Ca2+ conductance of MCU is driven by a ligand-relay mechanism, which depends on stochastic structural fluctuations in the conserved DxxE sequence. In the tetrameric structure of MCU, the four glutamate side chains of DxxE (the E-ring) chelate Ca2+ directly in a high-affinity complex (site 1), which blocks the channel. The four glutamates can also switch to a hydrogen bond-mediated interaction with an incoming hydrated Ca2+ transiently sequestered within the D-ring of DxxE (site 2), thus releasing the Ca2+ bound at site 1. This process depends critically on the structural flexibility of DxxE imparted by the adjacent invariant Pro residue. Our results suggest that the activity of the uniporter can be regulated through the modulation of local structural dynamics.\n\nA preliminary account of this work was presented at the 67th Annual Meeting of the Biophysical Society in San Diego, CA, February 18-22, 2023",

    "abstract": "A multiple channel QRS detector is described. Separately for each channel, the detector generates sequences of peaks and statistically scores them according to: 1) peak prominence; 2) temporal regularity; 3) peak shape similarity; and 4) number of skipped beats. In the case of unstructured rhythms, the temporal regularity score is null and does not contribute to sequence quality. If at least one winning score from any channel exceeds a quality threshold, multi-channel sequences are generated from the winning sequences peaks and scored according to the above measures and peak time coherence across channels. The winning multi-channel sequence is then selected. The algorithm was applied to both channels of the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. Over the entire database, the sensitivity (SE) and positive predictive value (PPV) were 99.93% and 99.96% respectively. For record 203, generally considered the most difficult one in the database, the SE and PPV were 99.80% and 99.76% respectively. The present algorithm fits within the framework of a previously described algorithm that can detect sinus rhythm in high noise conditions (e.g. waist based textile electrode recordings of a jogging subject).",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRNA editing is a process that increases transcriptome diversity, often through Adenosine Deaminases Acting on RNA (ADARs) that catalyze the deamination of adenosine to inosine. ADAR editing plays an important role in regulating brain function and immune activation, and is dynamically regulated during brain development. Additionally, the ADAR1 p150 isoform is induced by interferons in viral infection and plays a role in antiviral immune response. However, the question of how virus-induced ADAR expression affects host transcriptome editing remains largely unanswered. This question is particularly relevant in the context of congenital infections, given the dynamic regulation of ADAR editing during brain development, the importance of this editing for brain function, and subsequent neurological symptoms of such infections, including microcephaly, sensory issues, and other neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Here, we begin to address this question, examining ADAR expression in publicly available datasets of congenital infections of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) microarray expression data, as well as mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and mouse/ human induced pluripotent neuroprogenitor stem cell (hiNPC) Zika virus (ZIKV) RNA-seq data.\n\nResultsWe found that in all three datasets, ADAR1 was overexpressed in infected samples compared to uninfected samples. In the RNA-seq datasets, editing rates were also analyzed. In all mouse infections cases, the number of editing sites was significantly increased in infected samples, albeit this was not the case for hiNPC ZIKV samples. Mouse ZIKV samples showed altered editing of well-established protein-recoding sites such as Gria3, Grik5, and Nova1, as well as editing sites that may impact miRNA binding.\n\nConclusionsOur findings provide evidence for changes in ADAR expression and subsequent dysregulation of ADAR editing of host transcriptomes in congenital infections. These changes in editing patterns of key neural genes have potential significance in the development of neurological symptoms, thus contributing to neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Further experiments should be performed to explore the full range of editing changes that occur in different congenital infections, and to confirm the specific functional consequences of these editing changes.",

    "abstract": "The contribution of progenitor subtypes to generate the billions of neurons during human cortical neurogenesis is not well understood. We developed the Cortical ORganoid Lineage Tracing (COR-LT) system for human cortical organoids. Differential fluorescent reporter activation in distinct progenitor cells leads to permanent reporter expression, enabling the progenitor cell lineage of neurons to be determined. Surprisingly, nearly all neurons produced in cortical organoids were generated indirectly from intermediate progenitor cells. Additionally, neurons of different progenitor lineages were transcriptionally distinct. Isogenic lines made from an autistic individual with and without a likely pathogenic variant in the CTNNB1 gene demonstrated that the variant substantially altered the proportion of neurons derived from specific progenitor cell lineages, as well as the lineage-specific transcriptional profiles of these neurons, suggesting a pathogenic mechanism for this mutation. These results suggest individual progenitor subtypes play unique roles in generating the diverse neurons of the human cerebral cortex.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=194 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/545314v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@da0038org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@44997dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b90ff2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c5dbcd_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOGraphic AbstractC_FLOATNO C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that auditory cortex activity can be influenced by cross-sensory visual inputs. Intracortical recordings in non-human primates (NHP) have suggested a bottom-up feedforward (FF) type laminar profile for auditory evoked but top-down feedback (FB) type for cross-sensory visual evoked activity in the auditory cortex. To test whether this principle applies also to humans, we analyzed magnetoencephalography (MEG) responses from eight human subjects (six females) evoked by simple auditory or visual stimuli. In the estimated MEG source waveforms for auditory cortex region of interest, auditory evoked responses showed peaks at 37 and 90 ms and cross-sensory visual responses at 125 ms. The inputs to the auditory cortex were then modeled through FF and FB type connections targeting different cortical layers using the Human Neocortical Neurosolver (HNN), which consists of a neocortical circuit model linking the cellular- and circuit-level mechanisms to MEG. The HNN models suggested that the measured auditory response could be explained by an FF input followed by an FB input, and the cross-sensory visual response by an FB input. Thus, the combined MEG and HNN results support the hypothesis that cross-sensory visual input in the auditory cortex is of FB type. The results also illustrate how the dynamic patterns of the estimated MEG/EEG source activity can provide information about the characteristics of the input into a cortical area in terms of the hierarchical organization among areas.\n\nSignificance statementLaminar intracortical profiles of activity characterize feedforward- and feedback-type influences in the inputs to a cortical area. By combining magnetoencephalography (MEG) and biophysical computational neural modeling, we obtained evidence of cross-sensory visual evoked activity in human auditory cortex being of feedback type. The finding is consistent with previous intracortical recordings in non-human primates. The results illustrate how patterns of MEG source activity can be interpreted in the context of the hierarchical organization among cortical areas.",

    "abstract": "All animals use the Polycomb system to epigenetically repress developmental genes. The repression requires tri-methylation of Lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) by Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), but the dynamics of this process is poorly understood. To bridge the gap, we developed a computational model that forecasts H3K27 methylation in Drosophila with high temporal resolution and spatial accuracy of contemporary experimental techniques. Using this model, we show that pools of methylated H3K27 in dividing cells are defined by the effective concentration of PRC2 and the replication frequency. We find that the allosteric stimulation by pre-existing H3K27me3 makes PRC2 better in methylating developmental genes as opposed to indiscriminate methylation throughout the genome. Applied to Drosophila development, our model argues that, in this organism, the intergenerationally inherited H3K27me3 does not \"survive\" rapid cycles of embryonic chromatin replication and is unlikely to transmit the memory of epigenetic repression to the offspring. We foresee that our model is adaptable to other organisms, including mice and humans.",

    "abstract": "Macular neovascularization is a relatively common and potentially visually devastating complication of age-related macular degeneration. In macular neovascularization, pathologic angiogenesis can originate from either the choroid or the retina, but we have limited understanding of how different cell types become dysregulated in this dynamic process. In this study, we performed spatial RNA sequencing on a human donor eye with macular neovascularization as well as a healthy control donor. We identified genes enriched within the area of macular neovascularization and used deconvolution algorithms to predict the originating cell type of these dysregulated genes. Within the area of neovascularization, endothelial cells were predicted to increase expression of genes related to Rho family GTPase signaling and integrin signaling. Likewise, VEGF and TGFB1 were identified as potential upstream regulators that could drive the observed gene expression changes produced by endothelial and retinal pigment epithelium cells in the macular neovascularization donor. These spatial gene expression profiles were compared to previous single-cell gene expression experiments in human age-related macular degeneration as well as a model of laser-induced neovascularization in mice. As a secondary aim, we also investigated spatial gene expression patterns within the macular neural retina and between the macular and peripheral choroid. We recapitulated previously described regional-specific gene expression patterns across both tissues. Overall, this study spatially analyzes gene expression across the retina, retinal pigment epithelium, and choroid in health and describes a set of candidate molecules that become dysregulated in macular neovascularization.",

However, the impact of cortical structural features on the computational properties of neural circuits remains poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that a simple structural feature - cortical surface area (SA) - relates to specific computational properties underlying human visual perception. By combining psychophysical, neuroimaging, and computational modeling approaches, we show that differences in SA in the parietal and frontal cortices are associated with distinct patterns of behavior in a motion perception task. These behavioral differences can be accounted for by specific parameters of a divisive normalization model, suggesting that SA in these regions contributes uniquely to the spatial organization of cortical circuitry.

Here, we combined mouse-tracking and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) together in a value-based moral decision task, which allows us to quantify accumulative history responses as self-consistency. Using a multi-attribute time-dependent drift-diffusion model (tDDM), we disentangled the role of consistency and self-interest, highlighting the dominant role of cognitive-control-related regions. The drift rate of self-consistency was directly associated with the brain activity responsible for cognitive control, while the relationship between the reward and the activity of the related brain regions was mediated by the mouse-tracking index area under the curve(AUC). Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was revealed as a hub connecting prACC and ventral striatum, whose functional connectivity was correlated with consistency drift rate and reward drift rate respectively. Furthermore, decision flexibility was quantified by choice entropy, which links to mouse tracking indices and the activity of cognitive -control related regions. Together, our study uncovers the interplay between self-consistency and reward in behavior, and highlights the key role of cognitive control in modulating these two attributes, thereby deepening our understanding of consistency and flexibility in moral decisions.",

    "abstract": "Candida albicans is a diploid human fungal pathogen that displays significant genomic and phenotypic heterogeneity over a range of virulence traits and in the context of a variety of environmental niches. Here, we show that the effects of Rob1 on biofilm and filamentation virulence traits is dependent on both the specific environmental condition and the clinical strain of C. albicans. The C. albicans reference strain SC5314 is a ROB1 heterozygote with two alleles that differ by a single nucleotide polymorphism at position 946 resulting in a serine or proline containing isoform. An analysis of 224 sequenced C. albicans genomes indicates that SC5314 is the only ROB1 heterozygote documented to date and that the dominant allele contains a proline at position 946. Remarkably, the ROB1 alleles are functionally distinct and the rare ROB1946Sallele supports increased filamentation in vitro and increased biofilm formation in vitro and in vivo, suggesting it is a phenotypic gain-of-function allele. SC5314 is amongst the most highly filamentous and invasive strains characterized to date. Introduction of the ROB1946Sallele into a poorly filamenting clinical isolate increases filamentation and conversion of an SC5314 laboratory strain to a ROB1946S homozygote increases in vitro filamentation and biofilm formation. In a mouse model of oropharyngeal infection, the predominant ROB1946P allele establishes a commensal state while the ROB1946S phenocopies the parent strain and invades into the mucosae. These observations provide an explanation for the distinct phenotypes of SC5314 and highlight the role of heterozygosity as a driver of C. albicans phenotypic heterogeneity.\n\nImportanceCandida albicans is a commensal fungus that colonizes human oral cavity and gastrointestinal tracts but also causes mucosal as well as invasive disease. The expression of virulence traits in C. albicans clinical isolates is heterogenous and the genetic basis of this heterogeneity is of high interest. The C. albicans reference strain SC5314 is highly invasive and expresses robust filamentation and biofilm formation relative to many other clinical isolates. Here, we show that SC5314 derivatives are heterozygous for the transcription factor Rob1 and contain an allele with a rare gain-of-function SNP that drives filamentation, biofilm formation, and virulence in a model of oropharyngeal candidiasis. These finding explain, in part, the outlier phenotype of the reference strain and highlight the role of heterozygosity plays in the strain-to-strain variation of diploid fungal pathogens.",

Scanning electron microscope images of the surfaces revealed a network of fungal hyphae with multiple diatom cells attached to them via the side or the tip of their body. Using DNA metabarcoding for the fungal Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) barcode locus, we found that the symbiotic fungus belongs to the phylum Ascomycota, and that it is more abundant on low density polyethylene (LDPE) surfaces compared to other plastic polymers and glass.

    "abstract": "Corynebacterium is a predominant genus in the skin microbiome, yet its genetic diversity on skin is incompletely characterized and lacks a comprehensive set of reference genomes. Our work aims to investigate the distribution of Corynebacterium species on the skin, as well as to expand the existing genome reference catalog to enable more complete characterization of skin metagenomes. We used V1-V3 16S rRNA gene sequencing data from 14 body sites of 23 healthy volunteers to characterize Corynebacterium diversity and distribution across healthy human skin. Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum is the predominant species found on human skin and we identified two distinct C. tuberculostearicum ribotypes (A & B) that can be distinguished by variation in the 16S rRNA V1-V3 sequence. One is distributed across all body sites and the other found primarily on the feet. We performed whole genome sequencing of 40 C. tuberculostearicum isolates cultured from the skin of five healthy individuals across seven skin sites. We generated five closed genomes of diverse C. tuberculostearicum which revealed that C. tuberculostearicum isolates are largely syntenic and carry a diversity of methylation patterns, plasmids and CRISPR/Cas systems. The pangenome of C. tuberculostearicum is open with a core genome size of 1806 genes and a pangenome size of 5451 total genes. This expanded pangenome enabled the mapping of 24% more C. tuberculostearicum reads from shotgun metagenomic datasets derived from skin body sites. Finally, while the genomes from this study all fall within a C. tuberculostearicum species complex, the ribotype B isolates may constitute a new species.\n\nIMPORTANCEAmplicon sequencing data combined with isolate whole genome sequencing has expanded our understanding of Corynebacterium on the skin. Human skin is characterized by a diverse collection of Corynebacterium species but C. tuberculostearicum predominates many sites. Our work supports the emerging idea that C. tuberculostearicum is a species complex encompassing several distinct species. We produced a collection of genomes that help define this complex including a potentially new species which we are calling C. hallux based on a preference for sites on the feet, whole-genome average nucleotide identity, pangenomics and growth in skin-like media. This isolate collection and high-quality genome resource sets the stage for developing engineered strains for both basic and translational clinical studies.\n\nMicrobiomes are shaped by taxa that are both characteristic to those sites and functionally important to that community. The genus Corynebacterium is one such taxa for the human skin and nares. Foundational studies using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and shotgun metagenomics by our lab (1, 2) and others (3) have established Corynebacterium as common members of the skin microbiome. While Corynebacterium have been positively correlated with the resolution of dysbiosis associated with eczema flares (4), the importance of the Corynebacterium spp. is less defined for skin disease severity in primary immune deficient patients (5, 6). Corynebacterium spp. are predominant members of the human aerodigestive tract microbiome (nares, oral cavity and respiratory tract) (3) and participate in microbe-microbe interactions with members of nasal microbiome (7, 8). Corynebacterium have been shown to engage with the host immune system, specifically C. accolens-promoted IL23-dependent inflammation in mice on a high-fat diet (9). C. bovis and C. mastiditis have been shown to predominate the microbiome of a ADAM10-deficient mouse model (10) as well as an ADAM17-deficient mouse model of eczema (11). Finally, C. tuberculostearicum has been shown to induce inflammation in human epidermal keratinocyte cell cultures (12). These studies establish Corynebacterium spp. as key members of the skin microbiome capable of both microbe-microbe and microbe-host interactions.\n\nA critical resource for understanding the biology of Corynebacterium on the skin is a robust collection of complete reference genomes, including isolates collected from a variety of individuals and body sites. Previously published genome collections from skin- or nares-resident species include Staphylococcus epidermidis (13), Cutibacterium acnes (14) and the recent comparative analysis of Dolosigranulum pigrum (15). Of note, while emerging bioinformatic methods and pipelines are now being employed to extract nearly-complete genomes (MAGs) from metagenomic assemblies of skin samples (16), MAGs are not yet a substitute for genomes from cultured isolates to understand strain level or pangenomic diversity. In addition to functional prediction, comparative genomics is increasingly being used to augment conventional microbiological methods to define or redefine taxonomic boundaries (17, 18), as well as describe the full extent of diversity within these boundaries (19). A pangenome, which encompasses the complete set of genes present within a set of genome sequences, enables the characterization of gene-level heterogeneity within a taxonomic group. The pangenome is commonly subdivided into the  core genome, referring to genes present in all strains, and the  accessory or  dispensable genome, referring to those present in only one or some isolates. (The accessory pangenome can be further subdivided to reflect a wider range of gene uniqueness, e.g. singletons.) Thorough characterization of taxa is limited by the availability of representative and high-quality genome assemblies. Unfortunately, with the exceptions of clinically relevant Corynebacterium spp. (e.g., C. diphtheriae, C. striatum and C. pseudotuberculosis), the genus is inadequately sequenced, with 75% of species having fewer than six genomes. This includes common skin-associated species like C. tuberculostearicum with just five unique isolate genomes, only two of which are from skin.\n\nThis work seeks first to characterize the distribution of Corynebacterium across 14 skin sites from 23 healthy volunteers. The second goal of this work focuses on what we identify as the predominant skin Corynebacterium species, C. tuberculostearicum. We have sequenced 23 distinct C. tuberculostearicum strains (n=40 genomes before dereplication), a five-fold increase in the number of publicly available, unique genomes (n=5). In addition to short-read assemblies, we generated five complete genomes which, along with the type strain (DSM44922), demonstrate that C. tuberculostearicum genomes are largely syntenic and carry a number of methylation systems as well as a CRISPR/Cas system. Genes from the C. tuberculostearicum genomes in our collection fall into 5451 gene clusters comprising the species pangenome. This expanded pangenome, as compared to existing public references, improved the mapping of C. tuberculostearicum metagenomic reads from unrelated healthy volunteers. In addition, we have identified a distinct C. tuberculostearicum clade that is highly enriched on the feet that may represent a new species, tentatively designated Corynebacterium hallux.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 1 is a major cause of invasive pneumococcal disease. Despite its high attack rate, serotype 1 exhibits a low carriage prevalence within the population, which raises important questions about the relationship between carriage and transmission of hypervirulent pneumococcal strains between individuals. We compared the transmission dynamics of serotype 1 sequence type ST217 to serotype 2 strain D39 using a novel model of transmission in young adult mice. Donor index mice were intranasally infected with ST217, D39 or isogenic pneumolysin-deficient mutants and co-housed with recipient naive contact mice. Three days later, all mice were infected with influenza A virus (IAV). Pneumococcal transmission was analysed during colonisation alone and co-infection with IAV by quantification of shedding and nasal colonisation in index and contact mice. The role of the toxin pneumolysin in shedding, transmission and colonisation, and the host nasopharyngeal immune response were investigated. We show that ST217 was shed in index mice at significantly greater levels compared to D39. Upon viral co-infection, ST217 was shed and transmitted at a faster rate to contact mice and displayed higher transmission levels compared to D39. Interestingly, the toxin pneumolysin did not play a role in shedding. However, upon acquisition by contact mice, pneumolysin-dependent macrophage recruitment was observed in the nasopharynx. Our results show that the rapid and high transmission rate of serotype 1 is a key factor in its ability to disseminate quickly within the population and cause disease outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "Genetic association studies have linked ATP10A and closely related type IV P-type ATPases (P4-ATPases) to insulin resistance and vascular complications, such as atherosclerosis. ATP10A translocates phosphatidylcholine and glucosylceramide across cell membranes, and these lipids or their metabolites play important roles in signal transduction pathways regulating metabolism. However, the influence of ATP10A on lipid metabolism in mice has not been explored. Here, we generated gene-specific Atp10A knockout mice and show that Atp10A-/- mice fed a high-fat diet did not gain excess weight relative to wild-type littermates. However, Atp10A-/-mice displayed female-specific dyslipidemia characterized by elevated plasma triglycerides, free fatty acids and cholesterol, as well as altered VLDL and HDL properties. We also observed increased circulating levels of several sphingolipid species along with reduced levels of eicosanoids and bile acids. The Atp10A-/- mice also displayed hepatic insulin resistance without perturbations to whole-body glucose homeostasis. Thus, ATP10A has a sex-specific role in regulating plasma lipid composition and maintaining hepatic liver insulin sensitivity in mice.",
