    "abstract": "The NLRP3 inflammasome is a key regulator of inflammation that responds to a broad range of stimuli. The exact mechanism of activation has not been determined, but there is a consensus on cellular potassium efflux as a major common denominator. Once NLRP3 is activated, it forms high-order complexes together with NEK7 that trigger aggregation of ASC into specks. Typically, there is only one speck per cell, consistent with the proposal that specks form - or end up at - the centrosome. ASC polymerisation in turn triggers caspase-1 activation, leading to maturation and release of IL-1{beta} and pyroptosis, i.e., highly inflammatory cell death. Several gain-of-function mutations in the NLRP3 inflammasome have been suggested to induce spontaneous activation of NLRP3 and hence contribute to development and disease severity in numerous autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Consequently, the NLRP3 inflammasome is of significant clinical interest, and recent attention has drastically improved our insight in the range of involved triggers and mechanisms of signal transduction. However, despite recent progress in knowledge, a clear and comprehensive overview of how these mechanisms interplay to shape the system level function is missing from the literature. Here, we provide such an overview as a resource to researchers working in or entering the field, as well as a computational model that allows for evaluating and explaining the function of the NLRP3 inflammasome system from the current molecular knowledge. We present a detailed reconstruction of the molecular network surrounding the NLRP3 inflammasome, which account for each specific reaction and the known regulatory constraints on each event as well as the mechanisms of drug action and impact of genetics when known. Furthermore, an executable model from this network reconstruction is generated with the aim to be used to explain NLRP3 activation from priming and activation to the maturation and release of IL-1{beta} and IL-18. Finally, we test this detailed mechanistic model against data on the effect of different modes of inhibition of NLRP3 assembly. While the exact mechanisms of NLRP3 activation remains elusive, the literature indicates that the different stimuli converge on a single activation mechanism that is additionally controlled by distinct (positive or negative) priming and licensing events through covalent modifications of the NLRP3 molecule. Taken together, we present a compilation of the literature knowledge on the molecular mechanisms on NLRP3 activation, a detailed mechanistic model of NLRP3 activation, and explore the convergence of diverse NLRP3 activation stimuli into a single input mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Recent reports documenting sporadic infections in carnivorous mammals worldwide with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b have raised concerns about the potential risk of adaptation to sustained transmission in mammals, including humans. We report H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b infection of two grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) from coastal waters of The Netherlands and Germany in December 2022 and February 2023, respectively. Histological and immunohistochemical investigations showed in both animals a non-suppurative and necrotizing encephalitis with viral antigen restricted to the neuroparenchyma. Whole genome sequencing showed the presence of HPAIV H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b strains in brain tissue, which were closely related to sympatric avian influenza viruses. Viral RNA was also detected in the lung of the seal from Germany by real-time quantitative PCR. No other organs tested positive. The mammalian adaptation PB2-E627K mutation was identified in approximately 40% of the virus population present in the brain tissue of the German seal. Retrospective screening for nucleoprotein specific antibodies, of sera collected from 251 seals sampled in this region from 2020 to 2023, did not show evidence of influenza A virus specific antibodies. Similarly, screening by reverse transcription PCR of lung and brain tissue of 101 seals that had died along the Dutch coast in the period 2020-2021, did not show evidence of influenza virus infection. Collectively, these results indicate that individual seals are sporadically infected with HPAIV-H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, resulting in an encephalitis in the absence of a systemic infection, and with no evidence thus far of onward spread between seals.",

    "abstract": "In prokaryotes, DNA methylation has been found to be involved in several mechanisms, such as DNA repair, DNA-protein interactions, gene expression, cell cycle progression and self-DNA recognition (the Restriction-Modification systems). Studies on representatives from the same bacterial species have found that genome-wide DNA methylation patterns can be highly variable and may affect phenotypic variation and gene transfer among closely related strains. However, broader evolutionary studies on such epigenomic variation in bacteria are still scarce.\n\nHere, we addressed this point by performing an epigenomic analysis on 21 strains of the facultative plant symbiotic nitrogen-fixing alphaproteobacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti. Strains of these species are characterized by a divided (multipartite) genome structure, including a chromosome, a chromid and a (more recently acquired) megaplasmid. Since these strains display extensive genomic and phenotypic variation, they are good models to test evolutionary hypotheses on the relationships among epigenomic signatures, genome structure evolution and phenotypic switches.\n\nResults showed the presence of a wide pan-epigenome with 16 DNA methylated motifs, including both 4mC and 6mA palindromic and nonpalindromic motifs. While 9 motifs have been found methylated by all strains, the remaining had differential methylation between S. meliloti strains, constituting a dispensable epigenome. Differences in frequency of methylation were found among replicons, with the megaplasmid and the additional plasmids displaying several motifs with different methylation frequency with respect to the chromosome and the chromid. Moreover, differences between coding, upstream and intergenic regions, were found, suggesting that DNA methylation at specific motifs may play a role in gene regulation and consequently in phenotypic variability among strains.\n\nAltogether, our data indicate the presence of a large epigenomic diversity in S. meliloti, with epigenome signatures differing between replicons, reflecting their timing of evolutionary acquisition in S. meliloti genomes and suggesting a role of DNA methylation in the variability of gene expression among strains.",

    "abstract": "Tankyrase 1 and 2 are ADP-ribosyltransferases that use NAD+ as a substrate to catalyze polyADP-Ribose (PAR) onto themselves and their protein binding partners. Tankyrases have diverse cellular functions, ranging from resolution of telomere cohesion to activation of the Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling pathway. Robust and specific small molecule tankyrase inhibitors have been developed and are being investigated for cancer therapies. Tankyrase is regulated by the PAR-binding E3 ligase RNF146, which promotes K48-linked polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of PARylated tankyrases and their PARylated partners. We have identified a novel interaction between tankyrase and a distinct class of E3 ligases: the RING-UIM (Ubiquitin-Interacting Motif) family. We show that RING-UIM E3 ligases (specifically RNF114 and RNF166) bind and stabilize monoubiquitylated tankyrase and promote K11-linked diubiquitylation. This action competes with RNF146-mediated K48-linked polyubiquitylation and degradation, leading to stabilization of tankyrase and to a subset of its binding partners, including Angiomotin, a protein that functions in cancer signaling pathways. Moreover, we identify multiple PAR-binding E3 ligases (in addition to RNF146) that promote ubiquitylation of tankyrase and induce stabilization or degradation. Discovery of this novel K11 ubiquitylation of tankyrase that opposes K48-mediated degradation along with identification of multiple PAR-binding E3 ligases that ubiquitylate tankyrase, provide new insights into mechanisms of tankyrase regulation and may offer new uses for tankyrase inhibitors in cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "The development of fluorescent light up RNA aptamers (FLAPs) has paved the way for the creation of sensors to track RNA in live cells. A major challenge with FLAP sensors is their brightness and their limited signal-to-background ratio both in vivo and in vitro. To address this, we develop sensors using the Pepper aptamer, which exhibits superior brightness and photostability when compared to other FLAPs. The sensors are designed to fold into a low fluorescence conformation, and to switch to a high fluorescence conformation through toehold or loop-mediated interactions with their RNA target. Our sensors detect RNA targets as short as 20 nucleotides in length with a wide dynamic range over 300-fold in vitro, and we describe strategies for optimizing the sensors performance for any given RNA targets. To demonstrate the versatility of our design approach, we generate Pepper sensors for a range of specific, biologically relevant RNA sequences. Our design and optimization strategies are portable to other FLAPs, and offer a promising foundation for future development of RNA sensors with high specificity and sensitivity for detecting RNA biomarkers with multiple applications.",

    "abstract": "Diverse methods have been proposed for protein secondary structure prediction. However, such task still presents a challenge in bioinformatics. In this article various of these methods are implemented and analysed. First, a baseline using Support Vector Machine. Then a convolutional neural network (CNN), a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and a strategy of Ensembling both of these methods. Lastly, a novel technique Secundary Structure of Physicochemical Clustered Proteins (SSPCP) is proposed, which combines multiple CNNs trained accordingly to a protein feature clustering and combined using a neural network. The rationale behind SSPCP is that amino acids from proteins which have similar physicochemical characteristics should have the same secondary structure prediction for similar amino acids, but amino acids from differing proteins might have different structures. All of these methods use as features PSSM matrices extracted from PSIBLAST. For performance evaluation, 25pdb dataset was split into training and validation and the same subsets were used on all these methods achieving the Q3 score of CNN: 70.11%, LSTM: 69.25%, Ensemble: 70.71%, SSPCP: 70.91%.\n\nThe experimental results show that the features extracted from clustering of physicochemical properties of proteins seem to improve the accuracy of highly specific CNN models for accurate protein secondary structure prediction.",

In this project some previously studied mutations were implemented and their performance was evaluated via computational methods with tools such as Modeller, HADDOCK, PyMOL and Gromacs. One possible mutation that could lead to improved catalytic activity was proposed.\n\nResultsPET hydrolase DM S209F W130H and I179 provide interesting binding results with studied ligands, however a solution that combines both mutations does not seem viable, since the binding cleft becomes occluded. Following the same rationale, the triple mutant S209F W130H I179Q is proposed but instead leaves space in the binding cleft for ligand to enter and might bond with the oxygen at the ester group. The experiments conducted with triple mutant S209F W130H I179Q failed to beat HADDOCK score for DM, however its experimental results could still increase PET degradation. Results from surface charge may indicate an increase in stability and binding affinity for the protein.\n\nConclusionsAmong models implemented, DM S209F W130H seems the best model studied regarding BHET or PET binding.

Very early differentiated stem cell memory T cells (TSCM) have superior self-renewal, engraftment, persistence, and anti-cancer efficacy, but their potential for anti-viral ACT remains unknown. Here, we developed a clinically-scalable protocol for expanding Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific TSCM-enriched T cells with high proportions of CD4+ T cells and broad EBV antigen coverage. These cells showed tumor control in a xenograft model of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) and were superior to previous ACT protocols in terms of tumor infiltration, in vivo proliferation, persistence, proportion of functional CD4+ T cells, and diversity of EBV antigen specificity. Thus, our new protocol may pave the way for the next generation of potent unmodified antigen-specific cell therapies for EBV-associated diseases, including tumors, and other indications.",

NINJ2 is a close paralog of NINJ1 but it failed to mediate PMR. By cryoEM, we found that both NINJ1 and NINJ2 were able to assemble into linear filament that binds strongly to lipids on one side but is water-soluble on the other side. The more-or-less straight NINJ1 filament was able to wrap around a membrane bleb and solubilize it from the plasma membrane to induce PMR; however, the intrinsically curved NINJ2 filament failed to do so, explaining its incapability of mediating PMR. We further demonstrated that binding to cholesterol at the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer was responsible for the curving of the NINJ2 filament, while strong lipid binding at the outer leaflet was contributing to NINJ1s capability of mediating PMR.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about how the spectrum and etiology of germline mutagenesis might vary among mammalian species. To shed light on this mystery, we quantify variation in mutational sequence context biases using polymorphism data from thirteen species of mice, apes, bears, wolves, and cetaceans. After normalizing the mutation spectrum for reference genome accessibility and k-mer content, we use the Mantel test to deduce that mutation spectrum divergence is highly correlated with genetic divergence between species, whereas life history traits like reproductive age are weaker predictors of mutation spectrum divergence. Potential bioinformatic confounders are only weakly related to a small set of mutation spectrum features. We find that clocklike mutational signatures previously inferred from human cancers cannot explain the phylogenetic signal exhibited by the mammalian mutation spectrum, despite the ability of these clocklike signatures to fit each species 3-mer spectrum with high cosine similarity. In contrast, parental aging signatures inferred from human de novo mutation data appear to explain much of the mutation spectrums phylogenetic signal when fit to non-context-dependent mutation spectrum data in combination with a novel mutational signature. We posit that future models purporting to explain the etiology of mammalian mutagenesis need to capture the fact that more closely related species have more similar mutation spectra; a model that fits each marginal spectrum with high cosine similarity is not guaranteed to capture this hierarchy of mutation spectrum variation among species.",

Genome-wide association studies have identified common genetic effects on handedness or brain asymmetry, which mostly involve variants outside protein-coding regions and may affect gene expression. Implicated genes include several that encode tubulins (microtubule components) or microtubule-associated proteins. Here we examined whether left-handedness is also influenced by rare coding variants (frequencies [&le;] 1%), using exome data from 38,043 left-handed and 313,271 right-handed individuals (UK Biobank). The beta-tubulin gene TUBB4B showed exome-wide significant association, with a rate of rare coding variants 2.7 times higher in left-handers (0.076%) than right-handers (0.028%). The TUBB4B variants were mostly heterozygous missense changes, but included two frameshifts found only in left-handers. Other TUBB4B variants have been linked to sensorineural and/or ciliopathic disorders, but not the variants found here. Among genes previously implicated in autism or schizophrenia by exome screening, DSCAM and FOXP1 showed evidence for rare coding variant association with left-handedness. The exome-wide heritability of left-handedness due to rare coding variants was 0.91%.

    "abstract": "Studies of the genetic basis of behavioral variation have emphasized gene cooperation within networks, often overlooking gene conflicts. The Kinship Theory of Intragenomic Conflict (KTIC) proposes that conflicts can occur within genes when parent-specific alleles have different strategies for maximizing reproductive fitness. Here, we test a prediction of the KTIC - that selection should favor alleles which promote \"altruistic\" behaviors that support the reproductive fitness of kin. In honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies, workers act altruistically when tending to the queen by performing a \"retinue\" behavior, distributing the queens mandibular pheromone (QMP) throughout the hive. Workers exposed to QMP do not activate their ovaries, ensuring they care for the queens brood instead of competing to lay unfertilized eggs. Thus, the KTIC predicts that response to QMP should be favored by the maternal genome. Using a reciprocal cross design, we tested for parent-of-origin effects on the workers 1) responsiveness to QMP, 2) ovary activation, and 3) brain transcriptome. We hypothesized that QMP-responsive workers have smaller and less active ovaries, influenced by the workers parent-of-origin. With an allele-specific transcriptomic analysis, we tested whether QMP-responsive workers show enriched maternal allele-biased gene expression compared to QMP-unresponsive workers. Finally, we explored how parent-of-origin gene expression patterns are associated with overall gene expression patterns and regulatory networks. We report evidence in support of the KTIC for the retinue behavior and associated conflicts within gene networks. Our study provides new insights into the genetic basis of behavior and the potential for behavioral variation influenced by intragenomic conflict.",

    "abstract": "The initiation of directional cell motion requires symmetry breaking that can happen both with or without external stimuli. During cell crawling, forces generated by the cytoskeleton and their transmission through mechanosensitive adhesions to the extracellular substrate play a crucial role. In a recently proposed 1D model (Sens, PNAS 2020), a mechanical feedback loop between force-sensitive adhesions and cell tension was shown to be sufficient to explain spontaneous symmetry breaking and multiple motility patterns through stick-slip dynamics, without the need to account for signaling networks or active polar gels. We extended this model to 2D to study the interplay between cell shape and mechanics during crawling. Through a local force balance along a deformable boundary, we show that the membrane tension coupled with shape change can regulate the spatiotemporal evolution of the stochastic binding of mechanosensitive adhesions. Linear stability analysis identified the unstable parameter regimes where spontaneous symmetry breaking can take place. Using simulations to solve the fully coupled nonlinear system of equations, we show that starting from a randomly perturbed circular shape, this instability can lead to keratocyte-like shapes. Simulations predict that different adhesion kinetics and membrane tension can result in different cell motility modes including gliding, zigzag, rotating, and sometimes chaotic movements. Thus, using a minimal model of cell motility, we identify that the interplay between adhesions and tension can select emergent motility modes.",

    "abstract": "Creatine transporter deficiency (CTD) is an X-linked disease caused by mutations in the SLC6A8 gene. The impaired creatine uptake in the brain results in intellectual disability, behavioral disorders, language delay, and seizures. In this work, we generated human brain organoids from induced pluripotent stem cells of healthy subjects and CTD patients. Brain organoids from CTD donors had reduced creatine uptake compared with those from healthy donors. The expression of neural progenitor cell markers SOX2 and PAX6 was reduced in CTD derived organoids, while GSK3{beta}, a key regulator of neurogenesis, was up-regulated. Shotgun proteomics combined with integrative bioinformatic and statistical analysis identified changes in abundance of proteins associated with intellectual disability, epilepsy, and autism. Re-establishment of the expression a functional SLC6A8 in CTD-derived organoids restored creatine uptake and normalized the expression of SOX2, GSK3{beta} and other key proteins associated with clinical features of CTD patients. Our brain organoid model opens new avenues for further characterizing the CTD pathophysiology and supports the concept that reinstating creatine levels in patients with CTD could result in therapeutic efficacy.\n\nSummary HeadingTherapeutic targets associated with Creatine Transporter Deficiency",

    "abstract": "Auditory exposure plays crucial roles in shaping healthy brain development and generating lateralization of functional network organization. However, little is known about whether and how an initial lack of auditory exposure in early infancy may disrupt development of functional network lateralization. We addressed this issue by recruiting 55 infants with congenital sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and 60 typically developing (TD) controls. Resting-state fNIRS imaging data were acquired to construct hemispheric cerebral networks, and graph theory was applied to quantify the topological characteristics of hemispheric networks. The infants with SNHL exhibited efficient small-world characteristic within each hemispheric network, however, the lateralization of functional network efficiency was substantially disrupted. Compared with TD infants with significantly increased network efficiency lateralized toward left hemisphere with age, the SNHL infants did not exhibit the emergence and development of such cerebral lateralization. Furthermore, the increased leftward asymmetry in nodal efficiency with age was found in TD but not in SNHL infants. Interestingly, the degree of hearing loss had no correlation with lateralization strength in the SNHL group. These results suggest that SNHL infants exhibited disrupted development of cortical lateralization in functional network organization, and highlight the importance of auditory stimulation-promoted multisensory functional integration in early infancy.",

EZH2 encodes the enzymatic subunit of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) which mediates methylation of histone H3 lysine residue 27 (H3K27). Although PRC2 has been extensively studied at the molecular level, the effects of WS-associated EZH2 mutations on cells remain poorly understood. In this study, we expressed WS-associated EZH2 variants in mouse embryonic stem cells and found that they have dominant negative effects on Polycomb repressive function. These EZH2 variants decrease H3K27me2/3 and increase H3K27ac levels at intergenic regions, causing global chromatin decompaction and transcriptional upregulation of sensitive Polycomb target genes. Interestingly, a contrasting EZH2 variant linked to growth restriction caused opposing changes in H3K27 methylation and acetylation, and repressed the same cohort of Polycomb target genes. Our study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of EZH2-mutant human growth disorders, revealing the opposing changes in chromatin and transcription associated with Weaver syndrome and growth restriction, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Transporters of the Resistance-Nodulation-cell Division (RND) superfamily of proteins are the dominant multidrug efflux power of Gram-negative bacteria. The major RND efflux pump of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is MexAB-OprM, in which the inner membrane transporter MexB is responsible for recognition and binding of compounds. The high importance of this pump in clinical antibiotic resistance made it a subject of intense investigations and a promising target for the discovery of efflux pump inhibitors. This study is focused on a series of peptidomimetic compounds developed as effective inhibitors of MexAB-OprM. Previous analyses of antibacterial and biochemical activities showed that these compounds vary broadly in their efficiency as inhibitors or substrates of MexAB and can be categorized into different functional classes. Here, we performed multi-copy molecular dynamics simulations, machine learning analyses and site-directed mutagenesis of MexB to investigate interactions of MexB with representatives of the various classes. The analysis of both direct and water-mediated protein-ligand interactions revealed characteristic patterns for each class, highlighting significant differences between them. We found that efflux avoiders poorly interact with the access binding site of MexB, and inhibition engages amino acid residues that are not directly involved in binding and transport of substrates. In agreement, machine learning models selected different residues predictive of MexB substrates and inhibitors. The differences in interactions were further validated by site-directed mutagenesis. We conclude that the substrate translocation and inhibition pathways of MexB split at the interface (between the main putative binding sites) and at the deep binding pocket, and that interactions outside of the hydrophobic patch contribute to the inhibition of MexB. This molecular-level information could help in the rational design of new inhibitors and antibiotics less susceptible to the efflux mechanism.\n\nImportanceMultidrug transporters recognize and expel from cells a broad range of ligands including their own inhibitors. The difference between the substrate translocation and inhibition routes remains unclear. In this study, machine learning, computational and experimental approaches were used to understand dynamics of MexB interactions with its ligands. Our results show that some ligands engage a certain combination of polar and charged residues in MexB binding sites to be effectively expelled into the exit funnel, whereas others engage aromatic and hydrophobic residues that slow down or hinder the next step in the transporter cycle. These findings suggest that all MexB ligands fit into this substrate-inhibitor spectrum depending on their physico-chemical structures and properties.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae, a common cause of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, can cross the respiratory epithelial barrier to cause lethal septicemia and meningitis. S. pneumoniae pore-forming toxin pneumolysin (PLY) triggers robust neutrophil (PMN) infiltration that promotes bacterial transepithelial migration in vitro and disseminated disease in mice. Apical infection of polarized respiratory epithelial monolayers by S. pneumoniae at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 20 resulted in recruitment of PMNs, loss of 50% of the monolayer, and PMN-dependent bacterial translocation. Reducing the MOI to 2 decreased PMN recruitment two-fold and preserved the monolayer, but apical-to-basolateral translocation of S. pneumoniae remained relatively efficient. At both MOI of 2 and 20, PLY was required for maximal PMN recruitment and bacterial translocation. Co-infection by wild type S. pneumoniae restored translocation by a PLY-deficient mutant, indicating that PLY can act in trans. Investigating the contribution of S. pneumoniae infection on apical junction complexes in the absence of PMN transmigration, we found that S. pneumoniae infection triggered the cleavage and mislocalization of the adherens junction (AJ) protein E-cadherin. This disruption was PLY-dependent at MOI of 2 and was recapitulated by purified PLY, requiring its pore-forming activity. In contrast, at MOI of 20, E-cadherin disruption was independent of PLY, indicating that S. pneumoniae encodes multiple means to disrupt epithelial integrity. This disruption was insufficient to promote bacterial translocation in the absence of PMNs. Thus, S. pneumoniae triggers cleavage and mislocalization of E-cadherin through PLY-dependent and PLY-independent mechanisms, but maximal bacterial translocation across epithelial monolayers requires PLY-dependent neutrophil transmigration.",

    "abstract": "To eradicate bacterial pathogens, neutrophils are recruited to the sites of infection, where they engulf and kill microbes through the production of reactive oxygen and chlorine species (ROS/RCS). The most prominent RCS is antimicrobial oxidant hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which rapidly reacts with various amino acids side chains, including those containing sulfur and primary/tertiary amines, causing significant macromolecular damage. Pathogens like uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), the primary causative agent of urinary tract infections (UTIs), have developed sophisticated defense systems to protect themselves from HOCl. We recently identified the RcrR regulon as a novel HOCl defense strategy in UPEC. The regulon is controlled by the HOCl-sensing transcriptional repressor RcrR, which is oxidatively inactivated by HOCl resulting in the expression of its target genes, including rcrB. rcrB encodes the putative membrane protein RcrB, deletion of which substantially increases UPECs susceptibility to HOCl. However, many questions regarding RcrBs role remain open including whether (i) the proteins mode of action requires additional help, (ii) rcrARB expression is induced by physiologically relevant oxidants other than HOCl, and (iii) expression of this defense system is limited to specific media and/or cultivation conditions. Here, we provide evidence that RcrB expression is sufficient to E. colis protection from HOCl and induced by and protects from several RCS but not from ROS. RcrB plays a protective role for RCS-stressed planktonic cells under various growth and cultivation conditions but appears to be irrelevant for UPECs biofilm formation.\n\nIMPORTANCEBacterial infections pose an increasing threat to human health exacerbating the demand for alternative treatment options. UPEC, the most common etiological agent of urinary tract infections (UTIs), are confronted by neutrophilic attacks in the bladder, and must therefore be well equipped with powerful defense systems to fend off the toxic effects of RCS. How UPEC deal with the negative consequences of the oxidative burst in the neutrophil phagosome remains unclear. Our study sheds light on the requirements for the expression and protective effects of RcrB, which we recently identified as UPECs most potent defense system towards HOCl-stress and phagocytosis. Thus, this novel HOCl-stress defense system could potentially serve as an attractive drug target to increase the bodys own capacity to fight UTIs.",

It binds defined sequences (virS) upstream of VirB-dependent promoters and counteracts their silencing by the nucleoid-organizing protein H-NS. However, its precise mode of action remains unclear. Notably, VirB is not a classical transcription factor but related to DNA partitioning proteins of the ParB family, which have recently been recognized as DNA-sliding clamps using CTP binding and hydrolysis to control their DNA entry gate. Here, we show that VirB binds CTP, embraces DNA in a clamp-like fashion upon its CTP-dependent loading at virS sites and slides laterally on DNA after clamp closure. Mutations that prevent CTP binding block the loading of VirB clamps in vitro and the formation of VirB nucleoprotein complexes in vivo.

    "abstract": "RNase R is a highly processive, 3 - 5 exoribonuclease involved in RNA degradation, maturation, and processing in bacteria. In Pseudomonas syringae Lz4W, RNase R interacts with the RNase E to form the RNA degradosome complex and is essential for growth at low temperature. RNase R is also implicated in general stress response in many bacteria. We show here that rnr gene (encoding RNase R) deletion mutant of P. syringae is highly sensitive to various DNA damaging agents and oxidative stress. RNase R is a multidomain protein comprised of CSD, RNB and S1 domains. We investigated the role of each domain of RNase R and its exoribonuclease activity in nucleic acid damage and oxidative stress response. Our results revealed that RNB domain alone without its exoribonuclease activity is sufficient to protect against DNA damage and oxidative stress. We also show that association of RNase R with degradosome complex is not required for this function. Our study for the first time has discovered a hitherto unknown role of RNase R in protecting P. syringae Lz4W against DNA damage and oxidative stress.\n\nImportanceBacterial exoribonucleases play a crucial role in RNA maturation, degradation, quality control and its turnover. In this study, we have uncovered a previously unknown role of 3-5 exoribonuclease RNase R of P. syringae Lz4W in DNA damage and oxidative stress response. Here, we show that neither the exoribonuclease function of RNase R, nor its association with the RNA degradosome is essential for this function. Interestingly, in P. syringae Lz4W, the hydrolytic RNase R exhibits physiological roles similar to phosphorolytic 3-5 exoribonuclease PNPase of E. coli. Our data suggests that during the course of evolution, mesophilic E. coli and psychrotrophic P. syringae have apparently swapped these exoribonucleases to adapt to their respective environmental growth conditions.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing loss of corals and their reef ecosystems hastens the need to develop approaches that mitigate the impacts of climate change. Given the strong reliance of corals on their associated prokaryotic and microalgal symbionts, microbiome-targeted interventions in the form of probiotics or microbiome transplants are emerging as potential solutions. Although inoculation with beneficial microorganisms was shown to improve coral bleaching recovery, the mechanistic underpinnings and extent to which microbiomes can be manipulated are largely unknown. Research progress in this regard is often hindered by coral holobiont complexity and a lack of standardized diagnostics to assess physiological and phenotypic changes following microbial manipulation. Here we address these shortcomings by establishing short-term acute thermal stress assays using the CBASS (Coral Bleaching Automated Stress System) as a standardized and reproducible experimental platform to assess the impact of microbiome manipulation on stress tolerance phenotypes of the coral model Aiptasia. We show that thermal tolerance phenotypes following acute heat stress assays are highly reproducible, host species-specific, and can exert legacy effects with consequences for long-term thermal resilience. We further demonstrate the ability to resolve phenotypic differences in thermal tolerance following microbiome manipulation through pathogen incubation. By employing acute heat stress assays in conjunction with a tractable model organism, we present a standardized experimental platform that allows functional screening for microbes that affect thermal stress tolerance. Such effort may accelerate the discovery of microbes and microbial mechanisms mediating thermal tolerance and our ability to harness them to increase stress resilience.",

Here we show that the recombinant Chaetomium thermophilum Atg15 lipase domain (CtAtg15(73-475)) possesses phospholipase activity that in acidic environments digests phospholipid to generate lysophospholipid and free fatty acid.

We inserted the human rhinovirus 3C protease recognition sequence into the two sites and found that cleavage between S159 and V160 was important to activate CtAtg15(73-475). We confirmed that CtAtg15 compensated for the absence of ATG15 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, indicating that CtAtg15 could disintegrate S. cerevisiae IAC in vivo.

    "abstract": "A major bottleneck in the development of detection assays is the availability of positive controls. Their acquisition can be problematic; their maintenance is expensive and without them assays cannot be validated. Herein we present a novel strategy for the development of virus-mimicking positive controls (ViMAPCs). The time between design and application is less than five days, unlike alternatives which normally take several weeks to obtain and implement. The ViMAPCs provide a realistic representation of natural infection unlike alternatives and allow for an effortless recognition of lab-based contamination. The feasibility and adaptability of the strategy was evaluated using several RNA and DNA viruses. ViMAPCs can be used in diagnostics labs but also in monitoring of pathogen outbreaks where rapid response is of utmost importance.",

    "abstract": "Cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABPC; Pab1 in yeast) is thought to be involved in multiple steps of post-transcriptional control, including translation initiation, translation termination, and mRNA decay. To understand these roles of PABPC in more detail for endogenous mRNAs, and to distinguish its direct effects from indirect effects, we have employed RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq to analyze changes in the abundance and translation of the yeast transcriptome, as well as mass spectrometry to assess the abundance of the components of the yeast proteome, in cells lacking the PAB1 gene. We observed drastic changes in the transcriptome and proteome, as well as defects in translation initiation and termination, in pab1{Delta} cells. Defects in translation initiation and the stabilization of specific classes of mRNAs in pab1{Delta} cells appear to be partly indirect consequences of reduced levels of specific initiation factors, decapping activators, and components of the deadenylation complex in addition to the general loss of Pab1s direct role in these processes. Cells devoid of Pab1 also manifested a nonsense codon readthrough phenotype indicative of a defect in translation termination, but this defect may be a direct effect of the loss of Pab1 as it could not be attributed to significant reductions in the levels of release factors.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYMany human diseases are caused by having too much or too little of certain cellular proteins. The amount of an individual protein is influenced by the level of its messenger mRNA (mRNA) and the efficiency of translation of the mRNA into a polypeptide chain by the ribosomes. Cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABPC) plays numerous roles in the regulation of this multi-staged process, but understanding its specific role has been challenging because it is sometimes unclear whether experimental results are related to PABPCs direct role in a specific biochemical process or to indirect effects of its other roles, leading to conflicting models of PABPCs functions between studies. In this study, we characterized defects of each stage of protein synthesis in response to loss of PABPC in yeast cells by measuring whole-cell levels of mRNAs, ribosome-associated mRNAs, and proteins. We demonstrated that defects in most steps of protein synthesis other than the last can be explained by reduced levels of mRNAs that code for proteins important for that step in addition to loss of PABPCs direct role on that step. Our data and analyses serve as resources for the design of future studies of PABPCs functions.",

    "abstract": "Gene knockout experiments have shown that many genes are dispensable for a given biological function. The Oogenesin/Pramel family contains almost 85 paralogs, about thirty of which are specific to female (as well as male for some of them) germ cells. In this paper, we show that the deletion of a block of around 1Mb containing sixteen paralogous genes of the Oogenesin/Pramel family specific to germ cells, including Oogenesin-2, -3 and -4, has no consequences on fertility or prolificacy in mouse both sexes. The dispensability of these genes is probably due to the compensation by the other germ-cell specific paralogs.",
