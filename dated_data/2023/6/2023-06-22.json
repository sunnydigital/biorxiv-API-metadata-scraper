    "abstract": "BackgroundFollicular lymphoma (FL) is an incurable B-cell malignancy that constitutes a quarter of all lymphomas. Although RCHOP immuno-chemotherapy induces high rates of complete remission, almost all FL patients experience multiple relapses post-treatment. The limited understanding of treatment response heterogeneity is due to the absence of in vitro or in vivo experimental models, primarily because tumor cells heavily rely on their microenvironment to survive. In this study, we present an innovative xenograft model of primary FL cells in avian embryos, circumventing these limitations.\n\nMethodsWe developed the FL-AVI-PDX model by transplanting 20 biopsy FL samples, including good (n=11) and poor clinical responders (POD24, n=9), into chicken embryos. Each set of embryos was treated with RCHOP or vehicle intravenously. We evaluated the effect of immuno-chemotherapy on tumor volume by light sheet microscopy and on tumor biology by transcriptomic analysis at the single-cell level.\n\nResultsWe successfully engrafted all samples in avian embryos. We found that RCHOP treatment in ovo led to tumor volume reduction, which predicted progression-free survival in multivariate analysis, demonstrating the models capacity to capture clinical heterogeneity at the patient level. The FL-AVI-PDX model also provided a unique opportunity to analyze the transcriptomic impact of RCHOP on FL cells using single-cell RNA sequencing. We identified a signature of 21 genes upregulated after RCHOP exposure, displaying significant intra-tumoral heterogeneity. As a proof of concept, we validated the functional involvement of BAX, a gene from the RCHOP-induced signature, as a critical effector of immuno- chemotherapy in vitro and in avian embryos.\n\nConclusionsThe FL-AVI-PDX model is a platform for functional precision oncology in primary FL cells that captures both inter- and intra-patient heterogeneity of clinical response to a complex therapeutic regimen. It offers a unique opportunity to better understand FL biology, opening perspectives for the development of new drugs.",

    "abstract": "Most mitochondrial proteins need to be imported from the cytosol. Over half of mitochondrial proteins are imported through the pre-sequence pathway that is controlled by the TOM complex in the outer membrane and the TIM23 complex in the inner membrane. It is unclear on the molecular level how proteins cross the mitochondrial double membranes through the TOM and TIM23 complexes. Here, we report the assembly of the active TOM-TIM23 supercomplex with translocating polypeptide substrates captured in the import pathway. Electron cryo-microscopy (Cryo-EM) analyses reveal that during translocation across the outer membrane, the polypeptide substrates pass through the center of the Tom40 channel while interacting with a glutamine-rich patch in the inner wall of Tom40. Structural and biochemical analyses show that the TIM23 complex contains a heterotrimer of the subunits Tim23, Tim17, and Mgr2 in the inner membrane. Tim17 and Mgr2 shield the polypeptide substrates from the lipid environment. The import pathway consists of two highly conserved residue patches of Tim17, one negatively charged patch at the entrance and one hydrophobic patch in the middle of the pathway. These data reveal an unexpected pre-sequence pathway mediated by the TOM-TIM23 supercomplex for facilitating protein import across the double membranes of mitochondria.",

    "abstract": "Many bacteriophages modulate the host transcription machinery for efficient expression of their own genomes. Phage P4 polarity suppression protein, Psu, is a building block of the viral capsid and inhibits the hexameric transcription termination factor, {rho}, by presently unknown mechanisms. We elucidated cryogenic electron microscopy structures of {rho}-Psu complexes, showing that Psu dimers laterally clamp two inactive, open {rho} rings and promote their expansion to higher-oligomeric states. Systematic ATPase, nucleotide binding and nucleic acid binding studies revealed that Psu hinders {rho} ring closure and traps nucleotides in their binding pockets on {rho}. Structure-guided mutagenesis in combination with growth, pull-down and termination assays further delineated the functional {rho}-Psu interfaces. Bioinformatic analyses suggested that, in addition to guarding its own genome against {rho}, Psu enables expression of diverse phage-defense systems commonly found in P4-like mobile genetic elements across bacteria. Thus, Psu is a widespread gene regulator that inhibits {rho} via forced hyper-oligomerization.",

In this study, we proposed that FSCN1 has a potential indication for prognosis and is essential for the migration of HNSCC.\n\nMethodsWe analyzed the expression and survival association of FSCN1 in HNSCC using TCGA data. We compared the expression of FSCN1 in tumors from primary and metastasis HNSCC patients using QPCR, western blotting, and immunochemistry staining. We determined the migration velocity of multiple HNSCC cell lines using a chemotaxis migration assay. We analyzed the correlation between FSCN1 expression and HNSCC cell migration. We also test the effect of FSCN1 knockdown and overexpression on HNSCC cell migration.\n\nResultsFSCN1 was overexpressed in HNSCC than pair normal tissues and metastasis HNSCC than primary HNSCC. FSCN1 expression was associated with significantly poorer overall survival of HNSCC patients. FSCN1 was potentially associated with immune cell infiltration and migration-associated genes. FSCN1 level was correlated with the migration in HNSCC cell lines. Knockdown of FSCN1 reduced the migration and the overexpression of FSCN1 promoted the migration of HNSCC cell lines.\n\nConclusionFSCN1 is a potential prognostic marker and a critical biomolecule for the migration of HNSCC",

    "abstract": "Tirzepatide, a drug used in management of type II diabetes, is an activator of both glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptors. Tirzepatide treatment leads to weight loss in murine models of obesity, and clinical trials have shown the drug can lead to weight loss up to [~] 20% in overweight patients. Obesity has been shown to increase risk and/or to worsen prognosis of certain common cancers, including colon cancer, but the effect of tirzepatide on neoplasia has not been examined in detail. We studied the effects of this drug on the murine MC38 colon cancer model, which has previously shown to exhibit accelerated growth in hosts with diet-induced obesity. Tirzepatide did not cause tumor regression, but reduced tumor growth rates by [~] 50%. This was associated with substantial reductions in food intake, and in circulating levels of insulin and leptin. Tirzepatide had no effect on MC38 cancer cell proliferation in vitro, and the effect of tirzepatide on tumor growth in vivo could be phenocopied in placebo treated mice simply by restricting food intake to the amount consumed mice receiving the drug. This provides evidence that the drug acts indirectly to inhibit tumor growth. Our findings raise the possibility that use of tirzepatide or similar agents may benefit patients with obesity-related cancers.",

They are, however, expensive, low throughput, and are constrained by animal welfare considerations. Here, we assessed the chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) as an alternative to mice for preclinical cancer imaging studies.\n\nMethodsGrowth of NCI-H460 Fluc tumors on the CAM was optimized using a range of physical and chemical supports. Tumor-bearing eggs were imaged by dynamic 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) or (4S)-4-(3-18F-fluoropropyl)-L-glutamate (18F-FSPG) PET/CT following intravenous injection, with mice bearing subcutaneous NCI-H460 Fluc xenografts imaged with 18F-FDG for comparison. The dependence of the transporter system xc- on in ovo 18F-FSPG tumor uptake was determined through treatment with imidazole ketone erastin. Additionally, 18F-FSPG PET/CT was used to monitor treatment response in ovo 24 h following external beam radiotherapy.\n\nResultsNCI-H460 Fluc cells grown in Matrigel formed vascularized tumors of reproducible size without compromising embryo viability. By designing a simple method for cannulation it was possible to perform dynamic PET imaging in ovo, producing high tumor-to-background signal for both 18F-FDG and 18F-FSPG. 18F-FDG tumor uptake kinetics were similar in ovo and in vivo, with 18F-FSPG providing an early marker of both treatment response and target inhibition in CAM-grown tumors.\n\nConclusionsThe CAM provides a low-cost alternative to tumor xenograft mouse models which may broaden access to PET and SPECT imaging. Rapid tumor growth and high-quality PET images that can be obtained with this model suggest its potential use for early radiotracer screening, pharmacological studies, and monitoring response to therapy.",

We developed two novel methodologies to test for depletion of predicted neoantigens in patient cohorts, which both compare patients in terms of their expected number of neoantigens per mutational event. Application of these strategies to TCGA patient cohorts showed that neither basic nor more extensive versions of the methodologies, controlling for confounding factors such as genomic loss of the HLA locus, provided statistically significant evidence for neoantigen depletion. In the subset of analyses that did show a trend towards neoantigen depletion, statistical significance was not reached and depletion was not consistently observed across HLA alleles. Our results challenge the notion that neoantigen depletion is detectable in cohorts of unmatched patient samples using HLA binding prediction-based methodology.",

    "abstract": "Metastasis represents the deadliest outcome in cancer, leading to the vast majority of cancer-related deaths. Understanding the progression from micro-to macro-metastasis might improve future therapeutic strategies aimed at blocking metastatic disease. However, the difficulty of investigating vital, clinically undetectable, micro-metastases hindered our capacity to unravel phenotypic determinants of micro-metastases. In this work, we leveraged indocyanine green (ICG) dye to detect small sized liver micro-metastases across several cancer models. We exploited a method for infrared fluorescence scanning of fresh tissue and coring of cancer micro-metastases and succeeded in processing them for single-cell RNA sequencing. Our analysis revealed that distinct liver micro-metastases upregulate both shared and specific genes that can successfully predict breast cancer patient prognosis. Moreover, the ontology classification of these genes allowed the validation of several pathways, namely interferon response, extracellular matrix remodeling, and antioxidant response in metastatic progression. Ultimately, we showed that ICG can be successfully used to quantify breast cancer micro- and macro-metastases to lungs, which we showed to be abrogated through inhibition of H2O2-producing enzyme monoamine oxidase. Therefore, the ICG approach allowed us to identify not only determinant of breast cancer metastatization, but also to assess the therapeutic efficacy of targeting these genes which can be further investigated in clinic.",

    "abstract": "The interaction between tumor-derived exosomes and stroma is crucial for tumor progression. However, the mechanisms by which tumor cells influence stromal changes are not yet fully understood. Our study revealed that high-metastatic renal cancer cells are more effective in converting normal fibroblasts into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) compared to low-metastatic renal cancer cells. Meanwhile, high-metastatic renal cancer cells secrete more exosomal miR-222-3p, which can directly target PANK3, activate NF-kB signaling pathway in fibroblasts and induce intracellular metabolic reprogramming to produce more lactic acid through Warburg effect. The activated CAFs further promote renal cancer progression by secreting lactic acid and inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-8. Patients with renal cancer who have high levels of serum exocrine miR-222-3p are more likely to experience progression. These findings suggest that the intercellular communication between renal cancer cells and fibroblasts is facilitated by tumor exosomes. Targeting this communication may hold promise for the prevention and treatment of renal cancer.",

Though studies investigating the factors associated with among-individual variation in microbiome structure in wild animal species are increasing, knowledge of this variation at the individual level is scarce, despite the clear link between microbiome and nutritional status uncovered in humans and model organisms. Here, we combine detailed life history, foraging preference, and faecal microbiome data to investigate the relationship between diet, microbiome stability and rates of body mass gain in a migratory capital-breeding bird, the light-bellied Brent goose (Branta bernicla hrota). Our findings suggest that there is a significant relationship between foraging and the diversity, composition and stability of the faecal microbiome. We also suggest a link between foraging phenotype and the rates of mass gain during the spring staging of a capital breeder. This study offers rare insight into individual-level temporal dynamics of the gut microbiome of a wild host. Further work is needed to uncover the functional link between individual dietary choices, gut microbiome structure and stability, and the implications this has for the reproductive success of this capital breeder.",

However, many species of parasitic lice (Insecta: Phthiraptera) are notable exceptions, having mitogenomes fragmented into multiple circular chromosomes. To further understand the process of mitogenome fragmentation, we conducted a large-scale genomic study of a major group of lice, Amblycera. Using genomic information on mitogenome structure and a phylogenomic tree for 90 samples of this group, we found evidence for multiple independent origins of mitogenome fragmentation, some inferred to have occurred less than five million years ago. In addition, the base composition of mitogenomes in Amblycera shows less AT bias than other insects, and fragmentation is related to this reduction of AT bias. By combining phylogenomics and mitochondrial genomics, we provide a detailed portrait of mitogenome evolution across this major group of insects. The evidence of repeated and ongoing fragmentation represents a substantial advance in understanding the repeated nature of this process in lice.",

While establishing an antigen presentation system to identify TCR-epitope pairs from large libraries of genetically templated, ectopically expressed antigens, we observed a longitudinal suppression of antigen processing in B cells, which we call antigen processing attenuation (APA). Beyond its potential role in regulating B cell-enforced peripheral tolerance, APA represents a bottleneck to sustained antigen presentation in screening and vaccination approaches. To overcome APA we screened several pathways which might enhance processing. Notably, we identified several sequences derived from transmembrane domains (TM) of endoplasmic reticulum-resident proteins which promote sustained minigene-encoded antigen presentation. In particular, the first TM domain of SYT6, a protein associated with synaptic vesicles, greatly enhances processing and ameliorates APA. These findings suggest a new entry point into antigen processing pathways, enabling the discovery of novel immune epitopes and improving T-cell based immunization strategies.",

Mechanistically, shifting orientation states of KRAS4B G-domain exposes residues, such as Arg 73, Arg 102 and Arg 135, to the PM, and contributes to PS acyl chain sorting. Oncogenic mutations may shift orientation states of G-domains. We show that G12V, G12D, G12C, G13D and Q61H mutants of KRAS4B sort distinct PS species.

Here we interrogate this relationship in human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs), a somatic model of brain development that tolerates removal of DNA methyltransferase DNMT1. Upon loss of MORC2 or HUSH subunit TASOR in hNPCs, L1s remain silenced by robust promoter methylation. However, genome demethylation and activation of evolutionarily-young L1s attracts MORC2 binding. Simultaneous depletion of DNMT1 and MORC2 causes massive accumulation of L1 transcripts. We identify the same mechanistic hierarchy at pericentromeric -satellites and clustered protocadherin genes, repetitive elements important for chromosome structure and neurodevelopment respectively. Our data delineate the independent epigenetic control of repeats in somatic cells, with implications for understanding the vital functions of HUSH-MORC2 in hypomethylated contexts throughout human development.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) pair to sites in mRNAs to direct the degradation of these RNA transcripts. Conversely, certain RNA transcripts can direct the degradation of particular miRNAs. This target-directed miRNA degradation (TDMD) requires the ZSWIM8 E3 ubiquitin ligase. Here, we report the function of ZSWIM8 in the mouse embryo. Zswim8-/- embryos were smaller than their littermates and died near the time of birth. This highly penetrant perinatal lethality was apparently caused by a lung sacculation defect attributed to failed maturation of alveolar epithelial cells. Some mutant individuals also had heart ventricular septal defects. These developmental abnormalities were accompanied by aberrant accumulation of >50 miRNAs observed across 12 tissues, which often led to enhanced repression of their mRNA targets. These ZSWIM8-sensitive miRNAs were preferentially produced from genomic miRNA clusters, and in some cases, ZSWIM8 caused a switch in the dominant strand that accumulated from a miRNA hairpin--observations suggesting that TDMD provides a mechanism to uncouple co-produced miRNAs from each other. Overall, our findings indicate that the regulatory influence of TDMD in mammalian biology is widespread and posit the existence of many yet-unidentified transcripts that trigger miRNA degradation.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has hastened the problem of nosocomial drug-resistant pathogens and is exerting a huge toll on hospitalized patients in critical care settings. Most small molecule antibiotics are susceptible to bacterial resistance mechanisms and constantly becoming ineffective leading to rapid shrinkage of the antibiotic armamentarium. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one of the most common pathogens in hospital-born infection and considered critically dangerous by WHO and CDC, is extremely difficult to treat with frontline drugs, the carbapenems. In this study, we developed a camelid antibody fragment (VHH) library against whole P. aeruginosa and isolated a highly potent neutralizing hit (PsC23) that selectively targets P. aeruginosa . At 25 {micro}g/mL, PsC23 inhibited growth of the ATCC 27853 and a locally isolated carbapenem resistant MCC 50428 P. aeruginosa. The target of PsC23 is the C4 dicarboxylate transporter that transports C4 metabolites to the glyoxylate shunt during oxidative stress that is present in pathogens but not the human host. This ultimately results in the blockade of the shunt affecting bacterial energy transduction that leads to disruption of drug efflux. Interestingly, in a neutropenic mouse with MCC 50428 systemic infection, PsC23 in combination with meropenem completely reversed the drug resistance and eliminated the pathogens from the blood. PsC23 was stable in human serum and had no hemolytic or cytotoxic effect on human cells. Taken together, this VHH if co administered with the currently available carbapenems would reverse carbapenem resistance and could be used to effectively control P. aeruginosa in critical care settings.",

    "abstract": "The Structural Maintenance of Chromosome (SMC) protein complexes cohesin, condensin and the Smc5/6 complex (Smc5/6) are essential for chromosome function. At the molecular level, these complexes fold DNA by loop extrusion. Accordingly, cohesin creates chromosome loops in interphase, and condensin compacts mitotic chromosomes. However, the role of Smc5/6s recently discovered DNA loop extrusion activity is unknown. Here, we uncover that Smc5/6 associates with transcription-induced positively supercoiled chromosomal DNA at cohesin-dependent chromosome loop boundaries. Mechanistically, single-molecule imaging reveals that dimers of Smc5/6 specifically recognize the tip of positively supercoiled DNA plectonemes, and efficiently initiates loop extrusion to gather the supercoiled DNA into a large plectonemic loop. Finally, Hi-C analysis shows that Smc5/6 links chromosomal regions containing transcription-induced positive supercoiling in cis. Altogether, our findings indicate that Smc5/6 controls the three-dimensional organization of chromosomes by recognizing and initiating loop extrusion on positively supercoiled DNA.",

    "abstract": "Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis is a useful method for detecting spawning behaviour by observing elevated eDNA concentrations and/or nuclear/mitochondrial DNA ratios. However, little is known about the characteristics and dynamics of sperm-derived eDNA, which is key to detection. This study focused on changes in eDNA particle size distribution (PSD) and concentrations pre-, post-, and during spawning of Plecoglossus altivelis, to investigate the potential for semi-selective recovery of sperm-derived eDNA and the importance of sampling time for improving detection sensitivity. Firstly, PSD changes between pre- and post-spawning were investigated by comparing concentrations and proportions of eDNA obtained from filters with different pore sizes. Secondly, the diurnal changes in eDNA concentration were monitored at the peak of the spawning season by collecting river water every 1-3 hours. Results showed that eDNA related to sperm-head size increased at post-spawning, and eDNA concentrations had significant diurnal changes with a peak during the spawning time window. These findings suggest that semi-selective recovery of sperm-derived eDNA based on particle size and/or sampling during the spawning time window with increased concentrations can improve the detection sensitivity of eDNA-based spawning surveys. This study provides essential fundamental information for advancing eDNA-based spawning surveys and contributes to their further development.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=107 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/545639v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@134432dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@267657org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1236480org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9b3503_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The mammalian respiratory chain complexes I, III2 and IV (CI, CIII2 and CIV) are critical for cellular bioenergetics and form a stable assembly, the respirasome (CI- CIII2-CIV), that is biochemically and structurally well documented. The role of the respirasome in bioenergetics and regulation of metabolism is subject to intense debate and is difficult to study because the individual respiratory chain complexes coexist together with high levels of respirasomes. To critically investigate the in vivo role of the respirasome, we generated homozygous knock-in mice that have normal levels of respiratory chain complexes but profoundly decreased levels of respirasomes. Surprisingly, the mutant mice are healthy, with preserved respiratory chain capacity and normal exercise performance. Our findings show that high levels of respirasomes are dispensable for maintaining bioenergetics and physiology in the mouse, but raises questions about their alternate functions, such as relating to regulation of protein stability and prevention of age-associated protein aggregation.",
