    "abstract": "Endothelin convert enzyme-1(ECE-1) plays a significant role in cardiovascular development including four isoforms with unclear function. Therefore, we are interested in studying the function of ECE-1 isoforms through mitochondria due to the high correlation between congenital heart disease (CHD) and apoptosis. Since the expression of human Bax and Bcl-xL in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) results in similar effects in mammalian cells, a yeast system was generated for mimicking human Bax-induced apoptosis and the expression of human ECE-1 isoforms was involved. The correlation between Bax-induced growth defect and the candidates of apoptosis via mitochondrial pathway was preliminarily investigated in this system. Furthermore, the phenotypes of ECE-1 isoforms have been identified through yeast growth defect. Individual ECE-1 isoform does not affect yeast growth but act as enhancers for the Bax-induced growth defect. ECE-1c is the strongest enhancer that affect the expression of candidates of outer membrane translocases. This study indicates that ECE-1 might play an important role in inducing apoptosis and we speculate these findings are possible to provide new perspectives with clarifying the mechanism of CHD.",

    "abstract": "tRNAs serve as a dictionary for the ribosome translating the genetic message from mRNA into a polypeptide chain. Besides this canonical role, tRNAs are involved in other processes like programmed stop codon readthrough (SC-RT). There, tRNAs with near-cognate anticodons to stop codons must outcompete release factors and incorporate into the ribosomal decoding center to prevent termination and allow translation to continue. However, not all near-cognate tRNAs promote efficient SC-RT. Here, we demonstrate that those that do, establish critical contacts between their anticodon stem and ribosomal proteins Rps30/eS30 and Rps25/eS25 forming the decoding site. Unexpectedly, the length and well-defined nature of the anticodon stem determines the strength of these contacts, which is reflected in organisms with reassigned stop codons. These findings open a new direction in tRNA biology that should facilitate the design of artificial tRNAs with specifically altered decoding abilities.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional activation domains (ADs) of gene activators remain enigmatic for decades as they are short, extremely variable in sequence, structurally disordered, and interact fuzzily to a spectrum of targets. We showed that the single required characteristic of the most common acidic ADs is an amphiphilic aromatic-acidic surfactant-like property which is the key for the local gene-promoter chromatin phase transition and the formation of \"transcription factory\" condensates. We demonstrate that the presence of tryptophan and aspartic acid residues in the AD sequence is sufficient for in vivo functionality, even when present only as a single pair of residues within a 20-amino-acid sequence containing only 18 additional glycine residues. We demonstrate that breaking the amphipathic -helix in AD by prolines increases AD functionality. The proposed mechanism is paradigm-shifting for gene activation area and generally for biochemistry as it relies on near-stochastic allosteric interactions critical for the key biological function.",

    "abstract": "The gastric human pathogen Helicobacter pylori has developed mechanisms to combat stress factors, including reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are present in the stomachs harsh environment. Here, we present a comprehensive study on the redox switch protein HP1021 regulon combining transcriptomic, proteomic and DNA-protein interactions analyses. Our results indicated that HP1021 decides about H. pylori response to oxidative stress. HP1021 regulon included 498 genes, of which 411 responded to oxidative stress. HP1021 controlled typical ROS response pathways (katA, rocF) and less canonical ones, particularly DNA uptake and central carbohydrate metabolism. We identified HP1021 as the first molecular regulator of competence in H. pylori, as HP1021-dependent repression of the comB DNA uptake genes was relieved under oxidative conditions, increasing natural competence. Furthermore, HP1021 controlled glucose consumption by directly regulating the gluP transporter and had an important impact on maintaining the energetic balance in the cell.",

    "abstract": "RAD51 forms nucleoprotein filaments to promote homologous recombination, replication fork reversal, and fork protection. Numerous factors regulate the stability of these filaments and improper regulation leads to genomic instability and ultimately disease including cancer. RADX is a single stranded DNA binding protein that modulates RAD51 filament stability. Here, we utilize a CRISPR-dependent base editing screen to tile mutations across RADX to delineate motifs required for RADX function. We identified separation of function mutants of RADX that bind DNA and RAD51 but have a reduced ability to stimulate its ATP hydrolysis activity. Cells expressing these RADX mutants accumulate RAD51 on chromatin, exhibit replication defects, have reduced growth, accumulate DNA damage, and are hypersensitive to DNA damage and replication stress. These results indicate that RADX must bind RAD51 and promote RAD51 ATP turnover to regulate RAD51 and genome stability during DNA replication.",
