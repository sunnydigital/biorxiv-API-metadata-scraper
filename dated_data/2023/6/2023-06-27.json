    "abstract": "Amplicon sequencing, metagenomics, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) are commonly used techniques to analyse microorganisms and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in activated sludge from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). However, the lack of workflow harmonisation poses challenges in comparing measurements across studies and research groups. To address this issue, we examined the impact of DNA extraction procedures on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, shotgun metagenomics, and qPCR analyses of activated sludge by combining two widely used DNA extraction kits (PowerSoil and FastDNA) and two commonly employed disruption instruments (bead-beater and vortex) through a 2x2 factorial experimental design involving four groups of three analysts performing DNA extractions in triplicates. Our findings revealed significant differences in DNA yield, purity, and reproducibility of amplicon sequencing profiles among the extraction kits. Operator variability also influenced the results. We compared microbiome profiles obtained by amplicon sequencing and metagenomics and observed that bead-beating introduced more variability among triplicates compared to vortexing. The combinations of extraction kits and disruption instruments impacted the relative abundances of specific phyla such as Actinobacteriota, Bacteroidota, and Nitrospirota. For resistome analysis, we employed metagenomics for high-resolution profiling and qPCR for high-sensitivity detection of ARGs. The compositions and diversities of resistome datasets were not significantly affected by the choice of extraction kits and disruption instruments. Although using the same method is ideal for accurate comparisons, our results suggest that acceptable reproducibility can still be achieved when using different methods. This finding encourages the implementation of ARG monitoring in wastewater treatment processes. However, it is important to consider biases introduced by DNA extraction workflows when designing analytical studies, interpreting their results, and comparing their findings. Striving for more harmonised molecular workflows is crucial in the field of wastewater microbiology and engineering.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=153 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/546617v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (33K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@caa36eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1afabfdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@448b9aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@296404_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOGraphical abstractC_FLOATNO C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Vitamin C (vitC) is a vital nutrient for health and also used as a therapeutic agent in diseases such as cancer. However, the mechanisms underlying vitCs effects remain elusive. Here we report that vitC directly modifies lysine without enzymes to form vitcyl-lysine, termed \"vitcylation\", in a dose-, pH-, and sequence-dependent manner across diverse proteins in cells. We further discover that vitC vitcylates K298 site of STAT1, which impairs its interaction with the phosphatase PTPN2, preventing STAT1 Y701 dephosphorylation and leading to increased STAT1-mediated IFN pathway activation in tumor cells. As a result, these cells have increased MHC/HLA class-I expression and activate immune cells in co-cultures. Tumors collected from vitC-treated tumor-bearing mice have enhanced vitcylation, STAT1 phosphorylation and antigen presentation. The identification of vitcylation as a novel PTM and the characterization of its effect in tumor cells opens a new avenue for understanding vitC in cellular processes, disease mechanisms, and therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Acyl-Coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) thioesters are compartmentalized intermediates that participate in in multiple metabolic reactions within the mitochondrial matrix. The limited availability of free CoA (CoASH) in the matrix raises the question of how the local acyl-CoA concentration is regulated to prevent trapping of CoASH from overload of any specific substrate. Acyl-CoA thioesterase-2 (ACOT2) hydrolyzes long-chain acyl-CoAs to their constituent fatty acids and CoASH, and is the only mitochondrial matrix ACOT refractory to inhibition by CoASH. Thus, we reasoned that ACOT2 may constitutively regulate matrix acyl-CoA levels. Acot2 deletion in murine skeletal muscle (SM) resulted in acyl-CoA build-up when lipid supply and energy demands were modest. When energy demand and pyruvate availability were elevated, lack of ACOT2 activity promoted glucose oxidation. This preference for glucose over fatty acid oxidation was recapitulated in C2C12 myotubes with acute depletion of Acot2, and overt inhibition of {beta}-oxidation was demonstrated in isolated mitochondria from Acot2-depleted glycolytic SM. In mice fed a high fat diet, ACOT2 enabled the accretion of acyl-CoAs and ceramide derivatives in glycolytic SM, and this was associated with worse glucose homeostasis compared to when ACOT2 was absent. These observations suggest that ACOT2 supports CoASH availability to facilitate {beta}-oxidation in glycolytic SM when lipid supply is modest. However, when lipid supply is high, ACOT2 enables acyl-CoA and lipid accumulation, CoASH sequestration, and poor glucose homeostasis. Thus, ACOT2 regulates matrix acyl-CoA concentration in glycolytic muscle, and its impact depends on lipid supply.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular levels of the amino acid aspartate are responsive to changes in metabolism in mammalian cells and can correspondingly alter cell function, highlighting the need for robust tools to measure aspartate abundance. However, comprehensive understanding of aspartate metabolism has been limited by the throughput, cost, and static nature of the mass spectrometry based measurements that are typically employed to measure aspartate levels. To address these issues, we have developed a GFP-based sensor of aspartate (jAspSnFR3), where the fluorescence intensity corresponds to aspartate concentration. As a purified protein, the sensor has a 20-fold increase in fluorescence upon aspartate saturation, with dose dependent fluorescence changes covering a physiologically relevant aspartate concentration range and no significant off target binding. Expressed in mammalian cell lines, sensor intensity correlated with aspartate levels measured by mass spectrometry and could resolve temporal changes in intracellular aspartate from genetic, pharmacological, and nutritional manipulations. These data demonstrate the utility of jAspSnFR3 and highlight the opportunities it provides for temporally resolved and high throughput applications of variables that affect aspartate levels.",

    "abstract": "SO_SCPLOWUMMARYC_SCPLOWType II topoisomerases effect topological changes in DNA by cutting a single duplex, passing a second duplex through the break, and resealing the broken strand in an ATP-coupled reaction. Curiously, most type II topoisomerases (topos II, IV, and VI) catalyze DNA transformations that are energetically favorable, such as the removal of superhelical strain; why ATP is required for such reactions is unknown. Here, using human topoisomerase II {beta} (hTOP2{beta}) as a model, we show that the ATPase domains of the enzyme are not required for DNA strand passage, but that their loss leads to increased DNA nicking and double strand break formation by the enzyme. The unstructured C-terminal domains (CTDs) of hTOP2{beta} strongly potentiate strand passage activity in the absence of the ATPase regions, as do cleavage-prone mutations that confer hypersensitivity to the chemotherapeutic agent etoposide. The presence of either the CTD or the mutations lead ATPase-less enzymes to promote even greater levels of DNA cleavaingevitro, as well as in vivo. By contrast, the aberrant cleavage phenotypes of these topo II variants is significantly repressed when the ATPase domains are restored. Our findings are consistent with the proposal that type II topoisomerases acquired an ATPase function to maintain high levels of catalytic activity while minimizing inappropriate DNA damage.",

    "abstract": "The inability to efficiently metabolize homocysteine (Hcy), which occurs in nutritional and genetic deficiencies, leads to hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) thereby causing endothelial dysfunction, a hallmark of atherosclerosis which underpins cardiovascular disease (CVD). The dysregulation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, and impaired autophagy play important roles in CVD. Biochemically, HHcy is characterized by elevated levels of Hcy and its metabolites, Hcy-thiolactone (HTL) and N-Hcy-protein (N-Hcy). However, whether these metabolites can dysregulate mTOR signaling and autophagy in endothelial cells is not known. Here, we examined the influence of HTL, N-Hcy, and Hcy on the PHF8/H4K20me1/mTOR/autophagy pathway in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). We found that treatments with HTL, N-Hcy, or Hcy significantly reduced PHF8 protein and mRNA expression, increased H4K20me1, and upregulated mTOR signaling. Autophagy was also impaired (significantly downregulated BECN1, ATG5, ATG7, and LC3 protein and mRNA levels). We also found that these changes were mediated by PHF8-targeting microRNA (miR): miR-22-3p and miR-1229-3p. The effects of HTL, N-Hcy, or Hcy on the miR expression and on the PHF8/H4K20me1/mTOR/autophagy pathway were abrogated by treatments with an inhibitor of miR-22 or miR-1229. Taken together, these findings show that Hcy metabolites can upregulate miR-22-3p and miR-1229-3p expression, which then dysregulate the PHF8/H4K20me1/mTOR/autophagy pathway, important for vascular homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "The glycoprofiling of two proteins, the free form of the prostate-specific antigen (fPSA) and zinc--2-glycoprotein (ZA2G), was assessed to determine their suitability as prostate cancer (PCa) biomarkers. The glycoprofiling of proteins was performed by analysing changes in the glycan composition on fPSA and ZA2G using lectins (proteins recognising glycans, i.e. complex carbohydrates). The specific glycoprofiling of the proteins was performed using magnetic beads (MBs) modified with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and antibodies that selectively enriched fPSA or ZA2G from human serum samples. Subsequently, the antibody-captured glycoproteins were incubated on lectin-coated ELISA plates. In addition, a novel glycoprotein standard (GPS) was used to calibrate the assay. The glycoprofiling of fPSA and ZA2G was performed in human serum samples obtained from men undergoing prostate biopsy after an elevated serum PSA, and prostate cancer patients with or without prior therapy. The results are presented in the form of a ROC (Receiver Operating Curve). A DCA (Decision Curve Analysis) to evaluate the clinical performance and net benefit of fPSA glycan-based biomarkers was also performed. While the glycoprofiling of ZA2G showed little promise as a potential PCa biomarker, the glycoprofiling of fPSA would appear to have significant clinical potential. Hence, the GIA (Glycobiopsy ImmunoAssay) test integrates the glycoprofiling of fPSA (i.e. two glycan forms of fPSA). The GIA test could be used for early diagnoses of PCa (AUC=0.84; n=501 samples) with a potential for use in therapy-monitoring (AUC=0.85; n=168 samples). Moreover, the analysis of a subset of serum samples (n=215) revealed that the GIA test (AUC=0.81) outperformed the PHI (Prostate Health Index) test (AUC=0.69) in discriminating between men with prostate cancer and those with benign serum PSA elevation.",

All participants were clinically unimpaired at baseline, and had subsequently undergone brain autopsy. Average age at baseline was 78.8 (6.92). A Bayesian regression analysis was carried out with global pathology as outcome; demographic, clinical and APOE data as covariates; and cognitive predictors, including delayed primacy.\n\nRESULTSGlobal AD pathology was best predicted by delayed primacy.

    "abstract": "CRISPR systems are widespread in the prokaryotic world, providing adaptive immunity against mobile genetic elements (MGE) 1, 2. Type III CRISPR systems, with the signature gene cas10, use CRISPR RNA (crRNA) to detect non-self RNA, activating the enzymatic Cas10 subunit to defend the cell against MGE either directly, via the integral HD nuclease domain 3-5 or indirectly, via synthesis of cyclic oligonucleotide (cOA) second messengers to activate diverse ancillary effectors 6-9. A subset of type III CRISPR systems encode an uncharacterised CorA-family membrane protein and an associated NrN family phosphodiesterase predicted to function in antiviral defence. Here, we demonstrate that the CorA associated type III-B (Cmr) CRISPR system from Bacteroides fragilis provides immunity against MGE when expressed inE. coli. However, B. fragilis Cmr does not synthesise cOA species on activation, instead generating a previously undescribed sigalling molecule, SAM-AMP (3-adenylyl-AdoMet) by conjugating ATP to S-adenosyl methionine via a phosphodiester bond. Once synthesised, SAM-AMP binds to the CorA effector, presumably leading to cell death by disruption of the membrane integrity. SAM-AMP is degraded by CRISPR associated phosphodiesterases or a SAM-AMP lyase, providing an \"off switch\" analogous to cOA specific ring nucleases 10. SAM-AMP thus represents a new class of second messenger for antiviral signalling, which may function in different roles in diverse cellular contexts.",

    "abstract": "The accurate distribution of genetic material is crucial for all organisms. In most bacteria, chromosome segregation is achieved by the ParABS system, in which the ParB-bound centromere parS is actively partitioned by ParA. While this system is highly conserved, its adaptation in organisms with unique lifestyles and its regulation between developmental stages remain unexplored. Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a predatory bacterium proliferating through polyploid replication and non-binary division inside other bacteria. Our study reveals the subcellular dynamics and multi-layered regulation of the ParABS system, coupled to the cell cycle of B. bacteriovorus. We found that ParA:ParB ratios fluctuate between predation stages, their balance being critical for cell cycle progression. Moreover, the parS chromosomal context in non-replicative cells, combined with ParB depletion at cell division, critically contribute to the unique cell cycle-dependent organization of the centromere in this bacterium, highlighting new levels of complexity in chromosome segregation and cell cycle control.\n\nAuthor summaryThe precise distribution of genetic material to the progeny is essential for all living organisms, and the ParABS system is critical for this process in bacteria. Our study provides novel insights into the regulation of this system in a predatory bacterium that exhibits a non-canonical cell cycle, in which the chromosome is copied and segregated multiple times during growth inside a prey bacterium. Our work reveals the subcellular dynamics and multi-level regulation of the ParABS system in this bacterium, which results in the unique cell-cycle dependent assembly of the segregation complex at the chromosomal centromere.

    "abstract": "The ability to form a dormant spore is essential for the survival of the anaerobic, gastrointestinal pathogen Clostridioides difficile outside of the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. The initiation of sporulation is governed by the master regulator of sporulation, Spo0A, which is activated by phosphorylation. Multiple sporulation factors control Spo0A phosphorylation; however, this regulatory pathway is not well defined in C. difficile. We discovered that RgaS and RgaR, a conserved orphan histidine kinase and orphan response regulator, function together as a cognate two-component regulatory system to directly activate transcription of several genes. One of these targets, agrB1D1, encodes gene products that synthesize and export a small quorum- sensing peptide, AgrD1, which positively influences expression of early sporulation genes. Another target, a small regulatory RNA now known as SrsR, impacts later stages of sporulation through an unknown regulatory mechanism(s). Unlike Agr systems in many organisms, AgrD1 does not activate the RgaS-RgaR two-component system, and thus, is not responsible for autoregulating its own production. Altogether, we demonstrate that C. difficile utilizes a conserved two-component system that is uncoupled from quorum-sensing to promote sporulation through two distinct regulatory pathways.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe formation of an inactive spore by the anaerobic gastrointestinal pathogen, Clostridioides difficile, is required for its survival outside of the mammalian host. The sporulation process is induced by the regulator, Spo0A; yet, how Spo0A is activated in C. difficile remains unknown. To address this question, we investigated potential activators of Spo0A. Here, we demonstrate that the sensor RgaS activates sporulation, but not by direct activation of Spo0A. Instead, RgaS activates the response regulator, RgaR, which in turn activates transcription of several genes. We found two direct RgaS- RgaR targets independently promote sporulation: agrB1D1, encoding a quorum-sensing peptide, AgrD1, and srsR, encoding a small regulatory RNA.

    "abstract": "IntroductionIn the light of the problem of antibiotic-resistance, the use of alternative combined therapies in combating bacterial-related issues has gained popularity. Therefore, using up-to-date laboratory techniques, possible interactions of lytic bacteriophages (MS2, T4 and Phi6), acetone and methanol S. rebaudiana extracts (SRa and SRm) in the bacterial environment have been examined.\n\nMaterial and MethodsUsing a microdilution method, phages-extracts coincubation assay, static interactions synographies and dynamic growth profile experiments in a bioreactor, it was found that the interactions in a static environment differ from interactions in a dynamic environment.\n\nResultsDynamic conditions alter the influence of extracts in a concentration-dependent manner. The effects of the SRa and SRm extracts on bacterial growth in a dynamic environment depend on the species of the phage and bacterial host. The greatest differences were observed for E. coli strains and their phages, whereas P. syringae and Phi6 phage reacted very similar to both extracts. The differences also emerged for single extracts within E. coli strains and their phages.\n\nConclusionsEvery extract type should be tested on a case-by-case basis and experiments outcomes should not be generalized before gathering data. Moreover, many varied experiments should be performed, especially when examining such multifactorial mixtures. Tested mixtures could be potentially used in multi-drug resistant bacterial infections treatments.",

    "abstract": "Comprehensive knowledge of mechanisms driving the acquisition of antimicrobial resistance is essential for the development of new drugs with minimized resistibility. To gain this knowledge, we combine experimental evolution in a continuous culturing device, the morbidostat, with whole genome sequencing of evolving cultures followed by characterization of drug-resistant isolates. Here, this approach was used to assess evolutionary dynamics of resistance acquisition against DNA gyrase/topoisomerase TriBE inhibitor GP6 in Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii. The evolution of GP6 resistance in both species was driven by a combination of two classes of mutational events: (i) amino acid substitutions near the ATP-binding site of the GyrB subunit of the DNA gyrase target; and (ii) various mutations and genomic rearrangements leading to upregulation of efflux pumps, species-specific (AcrAB/TolC in E. coli and AdeIJK in A. baumannii) and shared by both species (MdtK). A comparison with the experimental evolution of resistance to ciprofloxacin (CIP), previously performed using the same workflow and strains, revealed fundamental differences between these two distinct classes of compounds. Most notable were non-overlapping spectra of target mutations and distinct evolutionary trajectories that, in the case of GP6, were dominated by upregulation of efflux machinery prior to (or even in lieu) of target modification. Most of efflux-driven GP6-resistant isolates of both species displayed a robust cross-resistance to CIP, while CIP-resistant clones showed no appreciable increase in GP6-resistance.\n\nImportanceThe significance of this work is in assessing the mutational landscape and evolutionary dynamics of resistance acquisition against a novel antibiotic, GP6. This approach showed that, in contrast to ciprofloxacin (CIP), a previously studied a canonical DNA gyrase/topoisomerase-targeting clinical antibiotic, evolution of GP6-resistance is driven largely by early and most prominent mutational events leading to upregulation of efflux machinery. An identified asymmetry in cross-resistance of evolved GP6- vs CIP-resistant clones provides important guidelines for rational selection of potential treatment regimens. This study illustrates the utility of the established morbidostat-based comparative resistomics workflow for the assessment of new drug candidates and clinical antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "Legionella pneumophila grows within host cells by forming a specialized membrane-bound compartment via the Icm/Dot type IV secretion system (T4SS). T4SS translocated Sde proteins promote phosphoribosyl-linked ubiquitination (pR-Ub) of several mammalian cell proteins, including Rtn4. In response to modification, Rtn4 forms tubular ER aggregates around the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV). The loss of sde together with sdhA results in severe vacuole disruption at early infection timepoints. We tested if Rtn4 modification allowed it to serve as a physical barrier to protect its degradation from host-derived disruptive compartments. The challenge of the rtn4-/- macrophages with {Delta}sdhA partially phenocopied the challenge of rtn4+/+ with {Delta}sde{Delta}sdhA, indicating that Rtn4 plays a role in protecting LCV integrity. Depletion of rtn1 in rtn4-/- macrophages potentiated vacuole permeability when compared to rtn4-/- macrophages, consistent with Sde targeting multiple reticulon family members to support vacuole integrity. These results indicate that L. pneumophila exploits Rtn4 in cooperation with Rtn1 to establish a replication niche by promoting Sde-mediated tubular ER aggregates, arguing that these proteins function as a physical barrier during early steps of LCV biogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Giant viruses (phylum Nucleocytoviricota) are globally distributed in aquatic ecosystems1,2. They play major roles as evolutionary drivers of eukaryotic plankton3 and regulators of global biogeochemical cycles4. Recent metagenomic studies have significantly expanded the known diversity of marine giant viruses1,5-7, but we still lack fundamental knowledge about their native hosts, thereby hindering our understanding of their lifecycle and ecological importance. Here, we aim to discover the native hosts of giant viruses using a novel, sensitive single-cell metatranscriptomic approach. By applying this approach to natural plankton communities, we unraveled an active viral infection of several giant viruses, from multiple lineages, and identified their native hosts. We identify a rare lineage of giant virus (Imitervirales-07) infecting a minute population of protists (class Katablepharidaceae) and revealed the prevalence of highly expressed viral-encoded cell-fate regulation genes in infected cells. Further examination of this host-virus dynamics in a temporal resolution suggested this giant virus controls its host population demise. Our results demonstrate how single-cell metatranscriptomics is a sensitive approach for pairing viruses with their authentic hosts and studying their ecological significance in a culture-independent manner in the marine environment.",

However, there is a lack of systematic investigation into the kinetics of oxygen uptake ([Formula]O2) and extraction (HHb+Mb) during exercise in both sexes. Sixteen young adults (8 females, age: 27{+/-}5 years) completed three experimental visits. Incremental exercise testing was performed to obtain lactate threshold and [Formula]O2peak. Subsequent visits involved three six-minute cycling bouts at 80% of lactate threshold and one 30-minute bout at a work rate 30% between the lactate threshold and maximal ramp test power. Pulmonary gas exchange and near-infrared spectroscopy continuously sampled [Formula]O2 and HHb+Mb, respectively. The mean of six moderate and two heavy intensity transitions were modelled with mono-exponential curves to quantify the phase II response to exercise. Slow component amplitudes were also quantified for the heavy intensity domain.\n\nMales and females demonstrated similar relative [Formula]O2peak values (46.2{+/-}6.6 vs 40.5{+/-}6.7 ml.kg- 1.min-1, p=0.111), with males achieving [~]30% greater power outputs (p=0.002). In both the moderate and heavy intensity domains, the relative amplitude of the phase II transition was similar between sexes for [Formula]O2 (p[&ge;]0.179) and HHb+Mb (p[&ge;]0.193).

We show: (i) 19 out of 23 bacterial and 2 out of 4 archaeal phyla harbor uncharacterized SRM, (ii) four phyla including the Desulfobacterota harbor microorganisms with the genetic potential to switch between sulfate/sulfite reduction and sulfur oxidation, and (iii) the combination as well as presence/absence of different dsrAB-types, dsrL-types and dsrD provides guidance on the inferred direction of dissimilatory sulfur metabolism. We further provide an updated dsrAB database including >60% taxonomically resolved, uncultured family-level lineages and recommendations on existing dsrAB primers for environmental surveys.

    "abstract": "YisK is an uncharacterized protein in Bacillus subtilis previously shown to interact genetically with the elongasome protein Mbl. YisK overexpression leads to cell widening and lysis, phenotypes that are dependent on mbl and suppressed by mbl mutations. In the present work we characterize YisKs localization, structure, and enzymatic activity. We show that YisK localizes in a punctate and/or punctate-helical pattern that depends on Mbl, and that YisK interacts directly with another elongasome protein, FtsE. YisK belongs to the fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) superfamily and crystal structures revealed close structural similarity to two oxaloacetate (OAA) decarboxylases: human mitochondrial FAHD1 and Corynebacterium glutamicum Cg1458. We demonstrate that YisK can also catalyze the decarboxylation of OAA (Km = 134 {micro}M, Kcat = 31 min-1). A catalytic dead variant (YisK E148A, E150A) retains wild-type localization and still widens cells following overexpression, indicating these activities are not dependent on YisK catalysis. Conversely, a non-localizing variant (YisK E30A) retains wild-type enzymatic activity in vitro, but no longer widens cells following overexpression. Together these results suggest YisK may be subject to spatial regulation that depends on the cell envelope synthesis machinery.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe elongasome is a protein complex that guides lengthwise growth in some bacteria. We previously showed that in B. subtilis, overexpression of an uncharacterized enzyme (YisK), perturbed function of the actin-like elongasome protein Mbl. Here we show that YisK exhibits Mbl-dependent localization and interacts directly with another component of the elongasome, FtsE. Through biochemical and structural characterization, we demonstrate that like its mitochondrial homolog FAHD1, YisK can catalyze the decarboxylation of the oxaloacetate to pyruvate and CO2. YisK is the first example of an enzyme implicated in central carbon metabolism with subcellular localization that depends on Mbl.",
