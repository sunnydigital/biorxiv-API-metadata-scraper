    "abstract": "Myosin VI (Myo6) is the only minus-end directed nanomotor on actin, allowing it to uniquely contribute to numerous cellular functions. As for other nanomotors, proper functioning of Myo6 relies on precise spatio-temporal control of motor activity via a poorly defined off-state and interactions with partners. Our structural, functional, and cellular studies reveal key features of myosin regulation and indicate that not all partners can activate Myo6. TOM1 and Dab2 cannot bind the off-state while, GIPC1 binds Myo6, releases its auto-inhibition and triggers proximal dimerization. Myo6 partners thus differentially recruit Myo6. We solved a crystal structure of the proximal dimerization domain, and show that its disruption compromises endocytosis in HeLa cells, emphasizing the importance of Myo6 dimerization. Finally, we show that the L926Q deafness mutation disrupts Myo6 auto-inhibition and indirectly impairs proximal dimerization. Our study thus demonstrates the importance of partners in the control of Myo6 auto-inhibition, localization, and activation.",

    "abstract": "Although long read sequencing has enabled obtaining high-quality and complete prokaryotic genomes from metagenomes, many challenges still remain to completely decompose a metagenome into its constituent genomes. These challenges include obtaining enough biomass, high-molecular weight DNA extraction, determining the appropriate depth of sequencing, and bioinformatics challenges to separate closely related genomes. This study focuses on decomposing an estuarine water metagenome from USGS Station 36 in the South San Francisco Bay into its constituent genomes and counting the number of organisms present. To achieve this, we developed a new bead-based DNA extraction method, a novel bin refinement method, and sequenced the sample with 150 Gbases of nanopore sequencing. With our results, we were able to estimate that there are [~]500 bacteria and archaeal species in our sample, obtain 68 high-quality bins (>90% complete, <5% contamination, [&le;]5 contigs, no contigs shorter than 100 Kbases, and all ribosomal and necessary tRNA genes). Since we pre-filtered the sample at 11m and then collected directly on to a 0.1m filter, we also obtained many contigs of picoeukaryotes, environmental DNA of larger eukaryotes such as mammals, complete mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes, and detected [~]40,000 viral populations. This deep analysis of the taxonomy of the sample down to the strain and individual contig level allowed us to find that among picoeukaryotes, prokaryotes, and viruses there are likely only a few strains that comprise most of the species abundances. These results also indicate that to truly decompose a metagenome into its constituent genomes, we likely need 1Tbase of sequencing.\n\nIf you are reading this preprint, know that this is the paper we wanted to write, but it will likely be shortened for submission to a journal.",

    "abstract": "The competence of bacteria to colonize different environmental niches is often determined by their ability to form biofilms. This depends on both cellular and extracellular factors, such as individual characteristics of a strain, type of colonized surface (abiotic or biotic) or availability and source of nutrients. Pseudomonas donghuensis P482 efficiently colonizes rhizosphere of various plant hosts, but a connection between plant tissue colonization and biofilm formation has not been verified for P482 up to date. Here we demonstrate that the ability of P482 to form biofilm on abiotic surfaces and the structural characteristics of the biofilm are connected to the type of carbon source available to the bacteria, with glycerol promoting formation of developed biofilm at early stages. Also, the type of substratum, polystyrene or glass, significantly influences the ability of P482 to attach to the surface, possibly due to hydrophobic effects. Moreover, mutants in genes associated with motility or chemotaxis, synthesis of polysaccharides, and encoding proteases or regulatory factors, affected in biofilm formation on glass were fully capable of colonizing root tissue of both tomato and maize hosts. This indicates that the ability to form biofilm on distinct abiotic surfaces does not simply correlate with the efficient colonization of rhizosphere and formation of biofilm on plant tissue by P482.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe origin and genesis of highly malignant and heterogenous glioblastoma brain tumors remain unknown. We previously identified an enhancer-associated long non-coding RNA, LINC01116 (named HOXDeRNA here), that is absent in the normal brain but is commonly expressed in malignant glioma. HOXDeRNA has a unique capacity to transform human astrocytes into glioma-like cells. This work aimed to investigate molecular events underlying the genome-wide function of this lncRNA in glial cell fate and transformation.\n\nResultsUsing a combination of RNA-Seq, ChIRP-Seq, and ChIP-Seq, we now demonstrate that HOXDeRNA binds in trans to the promoters of genes encoding 44 glioma-specific transcription factors distributed throughout the genome and derepresses them by removing the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Among the activated transcription factors are the core neurodevelopmental regulators SOX2, OLIG2, POU3F2, and SALL2. This process requires an RNA quadruplex structure of HOXDeRNA that interacts with EZH2. Moreover, HOXDeRNA-induced astrocyte transformation is accompanied by the activation of multiple oncogenes such as EGFR, PDGFR, BRAF, and miR-21, and glioma-specific super-enhancers enriched for binding sites of glioma master transcription factors SOX2 and OLIG2.\n\nConclusionsOur results demonstrate that HOXDeRNA overrides PRC2 repression of glioma core regulatory circuitry with RNA quadruplex structure. These findings help reconstruct the sequence of events underlying the process of astrocyte transformation and suggest a driving role for HOXDeRNA and a unifying RNA-dependent mechanism of gliomagenesis.",

However, there are currently no methods for unbiased identification of RBPs that interact with specific RNA regions in living cells under endogenous settings. Here, we introduce TREX (Targeted RNase H-mediated extraction of crosslinked RBPs), a highly sensitive approach for identifying proteins that directly bind to specific RNA regions in living cells. We demonstrate that TREX outperforms existing methods in identifying known interactors of U1 snRNA, and reveals endogenous region-specific interactors of NORAD lncRNA. Using TREX, we generated a comprehensive region-by-region interactome for 45S rRNA, uncovering both established and novel interactions that regulate ribosome biogenesis. With its applicability to any RNA in any cell-type, TREX is the first RNA-centric tool for unbiased positional mapping of endogenous RNA-protein interactions in living cells.",

    "abstract": "A significant increase of hospital-acquired bacterial infections during the COVID-19 pandemic has become an urgent medical problem. Clostridioides difficile is an urgent antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogen and a leading causative agent of nosocomial infections. The increasing recurrence of C. difficile infection and antibiotic resistance in C. difficile has led to an unmet need for discovery of new compounds distinctly different from present antimicrobials, while antimicrobial peptides as promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics have attracted growing interest recently. Protein synthesis is an essential metabolic process in all bacteria and a validated antibiotic target. Initiation factor 1 from C. difficile (Cd-IF1) is the smallest of the three initiation factors that acts to establish the 30S initiation complex to initiate translation during protein biosynthesis. Here we report the solution NMR structure of Cd-IF1 which adopts a typical {beta}-barrel fold and consists of a five-stranded {beta}-sheet and one short -helix arranged in the sequential order {beta}1-{beta}2-{beta}3-1-{beta}4-{beta}5. The interaction of Cd-IF1 with the 30S ribosomal subunit was studied by NMR titration for the construction of a structural model of Cd-IF1 binding with the 30S subunit. The short -helix in IF1 was found to be critical for IF1 ribosomal binding. A peptide derived from this -helix was tested and displayed a high ability to inhibit the growth of C. difficile and other bacterial strains. These results provide a clue for rational design of new antimicrobials.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSynucleinopathies, including Parkinsons disease, multiple system atrophy, and dementia with Lewy bodies, are neurodegenerative disorders caused by the accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein protein. Developing effective vaccines against synucleinopathies has been challenging due to the difficulty of stimulating an immune-specific response against alpha-synuclein, conferring neuroprotection without causing harmful autoimmune reactions, and selectively targeting only pathological forms of alpha-synuclein. Previous attempts using linear peptides and epitopes without control of the antigen structure for immunization failed in clinical trials. The immune system was unable to distinguish between the native alpha-synuclein and its amyloid form.\n\nResultsThe prion domain of the fungal HET-s protein was selected as a scaffold to introduce select epitopes from the surface of alpha-synuclein fibrils. Four vaccine candidates were generated by introducing specific amino acid substitutions onto the surface of the scaffold protein in regions that showed structural similarity to alpha-synuclein fibril structures. Each vaccine candidate had unique amino acid substitutions that imitated a specific epitope from alpha-synuclein amyloid fibrils. The approach successfully mimicked the stacking of the parallel in-register beta-sheet structure seen in alpha-synuclein fibrils as the vaccine candidates were found to be structurally stable and self-assembling into the desired conformations. All vaccine candidates induced substantial levels of IgG antibodies that recognized pathological alpha-synuclein fibrils derived from a synucleinopathy mouse model. Furthermore, the resulting anti-sera recognized pathological alpha-synuclein aggregates in brain lysates from patients who died from dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, or Parkinsons disease, but did not recognize linear alpha-synuclein peptides. Each vaccine candidate induced a unique pattern of reactivity toward alpha-synuclein aggregates contained in distinct disease pathologies.\n\nConclusionsThis new approach, based on the rational design of vaccines using the secondary and tertiary structure of alpha-synuclein amyloid fibrils and strict control over the exposed antigen structure used for immunization, as well as the ability to mimic aggregated alpha-synuclein, provides a promising avenue towards developing effective vaccines against alpha-synuclein fibrils, which may be crucial for the prevention and treatment of synucleinopathies.",

    "abstract": "Colony screening in single and multi-species environments is an essential step for microbiome studies. However, it possesses a high possibility of inaccurately classifying the species of interest and demands a high degree of manpower and time. Thus, automating the classification of microbes is beneficial to minimize the time and inaccuracy in the colony screening/picking step. Here, we developed an automated microbial classification system for five target species, based on deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using images captured by an automated robotic colony picker. Multiple possible scenarios of colony culture and diverse morphologies of colonies were examined in building the training and test datasets to train and validate the model and performance on real-life implementations. The final model trained using 60,000 training images, with 12,000 images per species and 3-fold cross-validation, achieved a test accuracy of 94.2% and a test loss of 0.154. Upon testing using a deployment dataset of 4,500 images (900 images per species) with different methods of applying cells onto the agar plate, high accuracy of up to 96.6% was obtained. Five evaluation metrics were implemented to evaluate diverse scenarios of the test data to justify the validity of the model in real-life applications. This model forms a foundation for the classification of more species through transfer learning in the future.",

While nucleocytoviruses are known to be highly diverse in metagenomes, knowledge of their capsid structures is restricted to a few characterized representatives. Here, we visualize giant virus-like particles (VLPs, diameter >0.2 {micro}m) directly from the environment using transmission electron microscopy. We found that Harvard Forest soils contain a higher diversity of giant VLP morphotypes than all hitherto isolated giant viruses combined. These included VLPs with icosahedral capsid symmetry, ovoid shapes similar to pandoraviruses, and bacilliform shapes that may represent novel viruses. We discovered giant icosahedral capsids with structural modifications that had not been described before including tubular appendages, modified vertices, tails, and capsids consisting of multiple layers or internal channels. Many giant VLPs were covered with fibers of varying lengths, thicknesses, densities, and terminal structures. These findings imply that giant viruses employ a much wider array of capsid structures and mechanisms to interact with their host cells than is currently known. We also found diverse tailed bacteriophages and filamentous VLPs, as well as ultra-small cells. Our study offers a first glimpse of the vast diversity of unexplored viral structures in soil and reinforces the potential of transmission electron microscopy for fundamental discoveries in environmental microbiology.",

It employs a [~]750 kb construct that is sufficiently large to house the distinct chromatin types present at the inner and outer centromere, obviating the need to multimerize.

    "abstract": "Humans have the ability to craft abstract, temporally extended and hierarchically organized plans. For instance, when considering how to make spaghetti for dinner, we typically concern ourselves with useful \"subgoals\" in the task, such as cutting onions, boiling pasta, and cooking a sauce, rather than particulars such as how many cuts to make to the onion, or exactly which muscles to contract. A core question is how such decomposition of a more abstract task into logical subtasks happens in the first place. Previous research has shown that humans are sensitive to a form of hierarchical statistical learning named \"community structure\". Community structure is a common feature of abstract tasks characterized by a logical ordering of subtasks. This structure can be captured by a model where humans learn predictions of upcoming events multiple steps into the future, discounting predictions of events further away in time. One such model is the \"successor representation\", which has been argued to be useful for hierarchical abstraction. As of yet, no study has convincingly shown that this hierarchical abstraction can be put to use for goal-directed behavior. Here, we investigate whether participants utilize learned community structure to craft hierarchically informed action plans for goal-directed behavior. Participants were asked to search for paintings in a virtual museum, where the paintings were grouped together in \"wings\" representing community structure in the museum. We find that participants choices accord with the hierarchical structure of the museum and that their response times are best predicted by a successor representation. The degree to which the response times reflect the community structure of the museum correlates with several measures of performance, including the ability to craft temporally abstract action plans. These results suggest that successor representation learning subserves hierarchical abstractions relevant for goal-directed behavior.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYHumans have the ability to achieve a diverse range of goals in a highly complex world. Classic theories of decision making focus on simple tasks involving single goals. In the current study, we test a recent theoretical proposal that aims to address the flexibility of human decision making. By learning to predict the upcoming events, humans can acquire a  model of the world which they can then leverage to plan their behavior. However, given the complexity of the world, planning directly over all possible events can be overwhelming. We show that, by leveraging this predictive model, humans group similar events together into simpler \"hierarchical\" representations, which makes planning over these hierarchical representations markedly more efficient. Interestingly, humans seem to learn and remember both the complex predictive model and the simplified hierarchical model, using them for distinct purposes.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is a heterogenous disease in humans with individuals exhibiting a wide range of susceptibility. This heterogeneity is not captured by standard laboratory mouse lines. We used a new collection of 19 wild-derived inbred mouse lines collected from diverse geographic sites to identify novel phenotypes during Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. Wild-derived mice have heterogenous immune responses to infection that result in differential ability to control disease at an early timepoint. Correlation analysis with multiple parameters including sex, weight, and cellular immune responses in the lungs revealed that enhanced control of infection is associated with increased numbers of CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells and B cells. Surprisingly, we observed a negative correlation between IFN-{gamma} production and control of infection. Although in most lines high neutrophils were associated with susceptibility, we identified a mouse line that harbors high neutrophils numbers yet controls infection. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified a novel neutrophil signature associated with failure to control infection.\n\nSummaryInfection of a new collection of wild-derived mice with Mtb reveals differences in the outcome of infection associated with unique immunological phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Ancient DNA (aDNA) sequencing analysis typically involves alignment to a modern reference genome assembly from a related species. Since aDNA molecules are fragmentary, these alignments yield information about small-scale differences, but provide no information about larger features such as the chromosome structure of ancient species. We report the genome assembly of a female Late Pleistocene woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) with twenty-eight chromosome-length scaffolds, generated using mammoth skin preserved in permafrost for roughly 52,000 years. We began by creating a modified Hi-C protocol, dubbed PaleoHi-C, optimized for ancient samples, and using it to map chromatin contacts in a woolly mammoth. Next, we developed \"reference-assisted 3D genome assembly,\" which begins with a reference genome assembly from a related species, and uses Hi-C and DNA-Seq data from a target species to split, order, orient, and correct sequences on the basis of their 3D proximity, yielding accurate chromosome-length scaffolds for the target species. By means of this reference-assisted 3D genome assembly, PaleoHi-C data reveals the 3D architecture of a woolly mammoth genome, including chromosome territories, compartments, domains, and loops. The active (A) and inactive (B) genome compartments in mammoth skin more closely resemble those observed in Asian elephant skin than the compartmentalization patterns seen in other Asian elephant tissues. Differences in compartmentalization between these skin samples reveal sequences whose transcription was potentially altered in mammoth. We observe a tetradic structure for the inactive X chromosome in mammoth, distinct from the bipartite architecture seen in human and mouse. Generating chromosome-length genome assemblies for two other elephantids (Asian and African elephant), we find that the overall karyotype, and this tetradic Xi structure, are conserved throughout the clade. These results illustrate that cell-type specific epigenetic information can be preserved in ancient samples, in the form of DNA geometry, and that it may be feasible to perform de novo genome assembly of some extinct species.",

    "abstract": "MotivationUnderstanding the rules that govern enhancer-driven transcription remains a central unsolved problem in genomics. Now with multiple massively parallel enhancer perturbation assays published, there are enough data that we can utilize to learn to predict enhancer promoter relationships in a data driven manner.\n\nResultsWe applied machine learning to one of the largest enhancer perturbation studies integrated with transcription factor and histone modification ChIP-seq. Based on the learned model, we confirmed previously reported rules governing enhancer driven transcription, and we gained some insights that generated new hypotheses, such as a novel role for protecting against replication-transcription conflict at the active enhancers in CHAMP1. We also identified a distinct class of enhancers that drives target promoter transcription, but is not in strong contact with the promoters. There were two clusters of such enhancers that regulated ATG2A and the histone 1 cluster respectively. These enhancers were different from other typical enhancers, in that they had other strong enhancers nearby, and they also had strong H3K4me3 marks at the target promoters, both patterns that typically predict reduced enhancer influence, but here contributing in the opposite way. In summary, we find that integrating genomic assays with enhancer perturbation studies increases the accuracy of the model, and provides novel insights into the understanding of enhancer driven transcription.\n\nAvailabilitythe trained models and the source code are available at https://github.com/HanLabUNLV/abic.\n\nContactmira.han@unlv.edu",

    "abstract": "Striatal development is crucial for later motor, cognitive, and reward behavior, but age-related change in striatal physiology during the neonatal period remains understudied. An MRI-based measure of tissue iron deposition, T2*, is a non-invasive way to probe striatal physiology neonatally, linked to dopaminergic processing and cognition in children and adults. Striatal subregions have distinct functions that may come online at different time periods in early life. To identify if there are critical periods before or after birth, we measured if striatal iron accrued with gestational age at birth [range=34.57-41.85 weeks] or postnatal age at scan [range=5-64 days], using MRI to probe the T2* signal in N=83 neonates in three striatal subregions. We found iron increased with postnatal age in the pallidum and putamen but not the caudate. No significant relationship between iron and gestational age was observed. Using a subset of infants scanned at preschool age (N=26), we show distributions of iron shift between timepoints. In infants, the pallidum had the least iron of the three regions but had the most by preschool age. Together, this provides evidence of distinct change for striatal subregions, a possible differentiation between motor and cognitive systems, identifying a mechanism that may impact future trajectories.\n\nHighlightsO_LINeonatal striatal tissue iron can be measured using the T2* signal from rsfMRI\nC_LIO_LInT2* changed with postnatal age in the pallidum and putamen but not in the caudate\nC_LIO_LInT2* did not change with gestational age in any of the three regions\nC_LIO_LIPatterns of iron deposition (nT2*) among regions shift from infancy to preschool\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The P2 component of the auditory evoked potential is commonly thought to reflect acoustic stimulus properties as well as prior exposure to the materials, rather than change-related cortical activity. Here, we challenge this view by showing that the P2 is strongly increased in response to voice pitch changes with a stepwise pattern compared to changes in dynamic pitch contours typical for natural speech, and also reflects the magnitude of these pitch changes. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that neither the P2 nor any other component are affected by the harmonicity of the materials. Despite no prior exposure, artificially created inharmonic versions of the speech materials elicited similar activity throughout auditory cortex. This suggests that so-called harmonic template neurons observed in animal studies are either absent or do not exist in sufficient number in human auditory cortex to detect their activity extracranially. Crucially, both morphology and source reconstructions of the EEG data showed that the P2 appears to consist of two separate subcomponents. Whereas source activity for the \"P2a\" was strongest in right auditory cortex, the subsequent \"P2b\" included generators spread across auditory cortex and association areas, bilaterally. The two subcomponents thus likely reflect processing at different stages of the auditory pathway.",
