    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDResidues of pesticides on crops can result in mortality to foraging bees. The likelihood of mortality can be mitigated by applying pesticides in the evening so that their residues dissipate by the following morning when bees resume foraging. The dissipation rates of different pesticides, or their residual toxicity, is captured in a public-facing database compiled by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), but the database includes only a fraction pesticides bees are likely to encounter in the environment. Pesticide applicators in the U.S. encounter a Pollinating Insect Hazard Statement on pesticide labels, which coarsely indicate which products dissipate over the course of an evening. There is reason to suspect that these statements may not align with residual toxicity data, given previous findings of significant misalignment from published data discovered on the acute toxicity section of the Pollinating Insect Hazard Statement. Without a complete database of residual toxicity estimates, however, it is not possible to determine whether the residual toxicity components of the Pollinating Insect Hazard Statement similarly diverge from published studies.\n\nRESULTSWe compiled 48 studies and calculated the residual time to 25% mortality (RT25) of each assay for three different bee species (Apis mellifera, Nomia melanderi, and Megachile rotundata). Our findings were compared to the EPA published database of RT25 values. Of the RT25 values that we could compare, we found that over 90% of the values support a similar conclusion to EPA: that the active ingredient has extended residual toxicity (i.e., residues cause greater than 25% mortality for eight hours or more). Next, we compared our values and the EPAs values to the Pollinating Insect Hazard Statement in the Environmental Hazards sections of 155 EPA registered product labels. Of these labels, a little less than a third (27%) presented their residual toxicity in a manner inconsistent with their calculated RT25 and current EPA labeling guidelines. Moreover, over a third (33%) of labels contained an active ingredient which was neither listed under EPAs RT25 database nor had a published study to estimate this value.\n\nCONCLUSIONResidual toxicity of pesticides is a key parameter used by pesticide applicators to reduce impacts of their applications to bees. We provide the first evidence that many pesticide labels may convey residual toxicity information to applicators that is not correct and could lead to bees being exposed to toxic residues on plants. We also show large gaps in the availability of contemporary residual toxicity study for many pesticides, suggesting either researchers should conduct studies to estimate RT25 values for these products, or EPA should make data from registrants more readily available. Finally, our analysis identified significant variation found between RT25 values among different bee species tested, and different formulations of the same active ingredient, suggesting these factors should be incorporated into future bee residual toxicity studies.",

    "abstract": "Estimates of narrow sense heritability derived from genomic data that contain related individuals may be biased due to the within-family effects such as dominance, epistasis and common environmental factors. However, for many wild populations, removal of related individuals from the data would result in small sample sizes. In 2013, Zaitlen et al. proposed a method to estimate heritability in populations that include close relatives by simultaneously fitting an identity-by-state genomic relatedness matrix (GRM) and an identity-by-descent GRM. The IBD GRM is identical to the IBS GRM, except relatedness estimates below a specified threshold are set to 0. We applied this method to a sample of 8557 wild Soay sheep from St. Kilda, with genotypic information for 419,281 single nucleotide polymorphisms to investigate polygenic and monogenic traits. We also implemented a variant of the model in which the IBD GRM was replaced by a GRM constructed from SNPs with low minor allele frequency to examine whether any additive genetic variance is captured by rare alleles. Each model was compared to an animal model with a single GRM based on all genotyped markers (the IBS GRM) using a log likelihood ratio test. Whilst the inclusion of the IBD GRM did not significantly improve the fit of the model for the monogenic traits, it improved the fit for some of the polygenic traits, suggesting that dominance, epistasis and/or common environment not already captured by the non-genetic random effects fitted in our models may influence these traits.",

    "abstract": "Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) generated from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) have the potential for disease modeling to study disease pathogenesis and screening therapeutic interventions. In this study, we aimed to generate iPSCs from CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors of CML patients with varying responses to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. The generated CML-CD34-iPSC colonies displayed atypical \"dome-shaped\" morphology and underwent spontaneous differentiation in a few days. However, supplementation with imatinib (IM), the most widely used TKI to treat CML patients, in the culture medium improved the stability and maintenance of all isolated CML-CD34-iPSC colonies, allowing them to be maintained for more than 20 passages without significant differentiation. In contrast to previous studies, our results indicate that suppressing the BCR::ABL1 oncogenic pathway is essential for efficiently generating stable CML-iPSC colonies. Furthermore, we successfully differentiated these iPSCs to CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors both in the presence and absence of IM. This robust protocol for generating CML-iPSCs provides a valuable resource for disease modelling. The generated iPSCs will be a valuable tool for investigating CML pathophysiology, drug resistance mechanisms, and drug screening to identify novel and effective therapies for this disease.",

Dysfunctional epithelial compartment (EC) dynamics are implicated in UC pathogenesis although EC-specific studies are sparse.

Prominently, reduced frequencies of mature BEST4+OTOP2+ absorptive and BEST2+WFDC2+ secretory epithelial enterocytes were associated with the replacement of homeostatic, resident TRDC+KLRD1+HOPX+ {gamma}{delta}+ T cells with RORA+CCL20+S100A4+ TH17 cells and the influx of inflammatory myeloid cells.

Furthermore, therapeutic relevance of the observed cellular and transcriptomic changes was investigated in 3 additional published UC cohorts (n=23, 48 and 204 respectively) to reveal that non-response to anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor (anti-TNF) therapy was associated with EC related myeloid cell perturbations. Altogether, these data provide high resolution mapping of the EC to facilitate therapeutic decision-making and personalization of therapy in patients with UC.",

    "abstract": "Melanomas display high numbers of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which correlate with worse prognosis. Harnessing macrophages for therapeutic purposes has been particularly challenging due to their heterogeneity, based on their ontogeny and function and driven by the tissue-specific niche. In the present study, we used the YUMM1.7 model to better understand melanoma TAM origin and dynamics during tumor progression, with potential therapeutic implications. We identified distinct TAM subsets based on F4/80 expression, with the F4/80high fraction increasing over time and displaying tissue-resident-like phenotype. While skin-resident macrophages showed mixed on-togeny, F4/80+ TAM subsets in i.d. YUMM1.7 tumors originated almost exclusively from bone-marrow precursors. Mul-tiparametric analysis of macrophage phenotype showed a temporal divergence of F4/80+ TAM subpopulations, which also differed from skin-resident subsets, and from their monocytic precursors. Overall, F4/80+ TAMs displayed co-ex-pression of M1- and M2-like canonical markers, while RNA-seq and pathway analysis showed differential immunosup-pressive and metabolic profiles. GSEA showed F4/80high TAMs to rely on oxidative phosphorylation, with increased proliferation and protein secretion while F4/80low cells had high pro-inflammatory and intracellular signaling pathways, with lipid and polyamine metabolism. Overall, the present in-depth characterization provides further evidence of the ontogeny of the evolving melanoma TAMs, whose gene expression profiles matched recently-identified TAM clusters in other tumor models and human cancers. These findings provide evidence for potentially targeting specific immunosup-pressive TAMs in advanced tumor stages.",

The comparison of haploid and unphased genomes revealed structural differences between them, indicating distinct regions in each haploid. In addition, genetic linkage maps were constructed, and genetic and physical distances were compared. The results showed variations in polymorphism density across different regions of the chromosomes. Together, the obtained results provide valuable insights into the genomic characteristics and structural variations of satsuma mandarin and related citrus varieties.

    "abstract": "The early life environment can profoundly shape the trajectory of an animals life, even years or decades later. One mechanism proposed to contribute to these early life effects is DNA methylation. However, the frequency and functional importance of DNA methylation in shaping early life effects on adult outcomes is poorly understood, especially in natural populations. Here, we integrate prospectively collected data on fitness-associated variation in the early environment with DNA methylation estimates at 477,270 CpG sites in 256 wild baboons. We find highly heterogeneous relationships between the early life environment and DNA methylation in adulthood: aspects of the environment linked to resource limitation (e.g., low-quality habitat, early life drought) are associated with many more CpG sites than other types of environmental stressors (e.g., low maternal social status). Sites associated with early resource limitation are enriched in gene bodies and putative enhancers, suggesting they are functionally relevant. Indeed, by deploying a baboon-specific, massively parallel reporter assay, we show that a subset of windows containing these sites are capable of regulatory activity, and that, for 88% of early drought-associated sites in these regulatory windows, enhancer activity is DNA methylation-dependent. Together, our results support the idea that DNA methylation patterns contain a persistent signature of the early life environment. However, they also indicate that not all environmental exposures leave an equivalent mark and suggest that socioenvironmental variation at the time of sampling is more likely to be functionally important. Thus, multiple mechanisms must converge to explain early life effects on fitness-related traits.\n\nSignificance statementThe environment animals face when young can affect how they function throughout life. Long-lasting changes in DNA methylation--a chemical mark deposited on DNA that can affect gene activity--have been hypothesized to contribute to early life effects. But evidence for persistent, early environment-associated differences in DNA methylation is lacking in wild animals. Here, we show that early life adversity in wild baboons predicts DNA methylation levels in adulthood, especially for animals born in low resource environments and drought conditions. We also show that some of the changes we observe in DNA methylation have the capacity to influence gene activity levels. Together, our results support the idea that early experiences can become biologically embedded in the genomes of wild animals.",

    "abstract": "The latent human Cytomegalovirus (hCMV) infection can pose a serious threat of reactivation and disease occurrence in immune-compromised individuals, as well as burdens the immune system in immune-competent individuals. Though, T cells are at the core of the protective immune response to hCMV infection, a detailed characterization of different T cell subsets involved in protection against the hCMV infection is lacking. Here we analyzed the single-cell transcriptomes and the single-cell T cell antigen receptor (TCR) repertoires of over 8000 hCMV-reactive peripheral T cells isolated from different memory compartments. The hCMV-reactive T cells were highly heterogeneous and consisted of different developmental memory and functional T cell subsets such as, the long-term memory precursors and effectors, T helper-17, T regulatory cells (TREGs) and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). The hCMV-antigen specific TREGs were enriched for molecules linked to their suppressive function and interferon response genes. The CTLs were of two types, the pre-effector and effector like. Of particular interest was the mixture of both CD4-CTLs and CD8-CTLs in both the pre-effector and effector cytotoxic clusters, suggesting that both CD4-CTLs and CD8-CTLs share transcriptomic signatures. The huge TCR clonal expansion of both the cytotoxic clusters imply their predominant role in protective immune response to CMV. Further the clonotype sharing between the CTL clusters and the long-term memory clusters, indicate potential progenitors of CD4-CTLs. Together our study has identified many subsets of hCMV-specific memory T cells that may have implication in better understanding the hCMV-specific T cell immunity to design vaccination strategies and therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing antigen-specific B cells is a critical component of vaccine and infectious disease studies in rhesus macaques (RMs). However, it is challenging to capture immunoglobulin variable (IgV) genes from individual RM B cells using 5 multiplex (MTPX) primers in nested PCR reactions. In particular, the diversity within RM IgV gene leader sequences necessitates the use of large 5 MTPX primer sets to amplify IgV genes, decreasing PCR efficiency. To address this problem, we developed a switching mechanism at the 5 ends of the RNA transcript (SMART)-based method for amplifying IgV genes from single RM B cells, providing unbiased capture of Ig heavy and light chain pairs for cloning antibodies. We demonstrate this technique by isolating simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) envelope-specific antibodies from single-sorted RM memory B cells. This approach has several advantages over existing methods for PCR cloning antibodies from RMs. First, optimized PCR conditions and SMART 5 and 3 rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) reactions generate full-length cDNAs from individual B cells. Second, it appends synthetic primer binding sites to the 5 and 3 ends of cDNA during synthesis, allowing for PCR amplification of low-abundance antibody templates. Third, universal 5 primers are employed to amplify the IgV genes from cDNA, simplifying the primer mixes in the nested PCR reactions and improving the recovery of matched heavy and light chain pairs. We anticipate this method will enhance the isolation of antibodies from individual RM B cells, supporting the genetic and functional characterization of antigen-specific B cells.",

    "abstract": "Tryptophan is catabolized by gut microbes, resulting in a wide range of metabolites implicated in both beneficial and adverse host effects. However, it remains elusive how the gut microbial tryptophan metabolism is governed either towards indole, associated with adverse effects in chronic kidney disease, or towards indolelactic acid (ILA) and indolepropionic acid (IPA), associated with protective effects in type 2 diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease. Here, we used human fecal cultures in combination with a controlled three-species model to test competition for tryptophan, and measured the resulting metabolites both in vitro and in gnotobiotic mice colonized with the three species. We revealed that the generation of specific tryptophan-derived metabolites was not predominantly determined by the abundance of tryptophan metabolizing bacteria, but rather by substrate-dependent regulation of specific metabolic pathways. In vitro and in vivo, indole-producing Escherichia coli and ILA- and IPA-producing Clostridium sporogenes competed for tryptophan. Importantly, the fibre degrading Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron affected this competition by cross-feeding monosaccharides to E. coli, which inhibited indole production through catabolite repression, and thereby made more tryptophan available to C. sporogenes, increasing ILA and IPA production. We thus present the first mechanistic explanation for why consumption of fermentable fibres suppress indole production but promote the generation of other tryptophan metabolites associated with health benefits. We conclude that the availability of tryptophan and dietary fibre regulates gut microbiome tryptophan metabolism pathways, and consequently influences the balance between the different tryptophan catabolites generated. This balance has implications for host-microbial cross-talk affecting human health.",

    "abstract": "Corynebacterium species are globally ubiquitous in human nasal microbiota across the lifespan. Moreover, nasal microbiota profiles typified by higher relative abundances of Corynebacterium are often positively associated with health. Among the most common human nasal Corynebacterium species are C. propinquum, C. pseudodiphtheriticum, C. accolens, and C. tuberculostearicum. Based on the prevalence of these species, at least two likely coexist in the nasal microbiota of 82% of adults. To gain insight into the functions of these four species, we identified genomic, phylogenomic, and pangenomic properties and estimated the functional protein repertoire and metabolic capabilities of 87 distinct human nasal Corynebacterium strain genomes: 31 from Botswana and 56 from the U.S. C. pseudodiphtheriticum had geographically distinct clades consistent with localized strain circulation, whereas some strains from the other species had wide geographic distribution across Africa and North America. All four species had similar genomic and pangenomic structures. Gene clusters assigned to all COG metabolic categories were overrepresented in the persistent (core) compared to the accessory genome of each species indicating limited strain-level variability in metabolic capacity. Moreover, core metabolic capabilities were highly conserved among the four species indicating limited species-level metabolic variation. Strikingly, strains in the U.S. clade of C. pseudodiphtheriticum lacked genes for assimilatory sulfate reduction present in the Botswanan clade and in the other studied species, indicating a recent, geographically related loss of assimilatory sulfate reduction. Overall, the minimal species and strain variability in metabolic capacity implies coexisting strains might have limited ability to occupy distinct metabolic niches.\n\nIMPORTANCEPangenomic analysis with estimation of functional capabilities facilitates our understanding of the full biologic diversity of bacterial species. We performed systematic genomic, phylogenomic, and pangenomic analyses with qualitative estimation of the metabolic capabilities of four common human nasal Corynebacterium species generating a foundational resource. The prevalence of each species in human nasal microbiota is consistent with the common coexistence of at least two species. We identified a notably high level of metabolic conservation within and among species indicating limited options for species to occupy distinct metabolic niches and pointing to the importance of investigating interactions among nasal Corynebacterium species. Comparing strains from two continents, C. pseudodiphtheriticum had restricted geographic strain distribution characterized by an evolutionarily recent loss of assimilatory sulfate reduction in North American strains. Our findings contribute to understanding the functions of Corynebacterium within human nasal microbiota and to evaluating their potential for future use as biotherapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Enteric glial cells (EGCs) have been recently recognized as key components of the colonic tumor microenvironment (TME) indicating their potential role in colorectal cancer (CRC) pathogenesis. Although EGCs modulate immune responses in other intestinal diseases, their interaction with the CRC immune cell compartment remains unclear. Through a combination of single-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing, both in CRC murine models and patients, we found that EGCs acquire a reactive and immunomodulatory phenotype that drives tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) differentiation. Tumor-infiltrating monocytes direct CRC EGC phenotypic and functional switch via IL-1R signaling pathway. In turn, tumor EGCs promote monocyte differentiation towards pro-tumorigenic SPP1+ TAMs via secretion of IL-6. Finally, the distinct tumor EGC phenotype correlates with worse disease outcome in patients suffering from CRC. Our study reveals a previously unexplored and crucial neuroimmune interaction between EGCs and TAMs in the colorectal TME, providing important insights into CRC pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Bioengineering soil metabolism by inoculation is an emerging approach to enhance plant growth and strengthen specific functions such as N2O reduction in order to reduce climate forcing. The use of organic wastes as substrates and carriers of microbial biomass has proven to be a viable approach to improving effectiveness and economic viability. A key factor in the success of this approach lies in selection of microbes capable of growth and survival in both organic wastes as well as soils, and which are tolerant of the rapid environmental fluctuations such fertilisations involve. A dual substrate, N2O-enrichment experiment, switching between soil and organic waste as substrates has yielded Cloacibacterium isolates which grow well in organic wastes and retain significant N2O reduction capacity when applied to soils. However, an understanding of the genetic and phenotypic characteristics utilised by these enrichment winners to dominate under such conditions remains unexplored. Here we have performed a multi-omics examination of the enrichment cultures, using both metagenomics and metaproteomics to probe the genetic basis and expressed proteins which may contribute to the success of Cloacibacterium in the enrichments, and their survival in soil. These omics results show an increase in complex carbohydrate metabolism, chemotaxis and motility genes throughout the enrichment as well as the expression of gliding motility proteins and polysaccharide utilization loci proteins by Cloacibacterium organisms. Taken together this suggests that attachment and complex polysaccharide utilisation may be key processes allowing Cloacibacterium to tolerate the stresses of a changing environment during transfers between digestate and soil.",

We leveraged a long-term field study in Belize to uncover novel hemoplasma diversity in bats by analyzing 80 samples from 19 species, most of which are infrequently encountered. PCR targeting the partial 16S rRNA gene found 41% of bats positive for hemoplasmas. Phylogenetic analyses found two novel host shifts of hemoplasmas, four entirely new hemoplasma genotypes, and the first hemoplasma detections in four bat species. One of these novel hemoplasmas (from Neoeptesicus furinalis) shared 97.6% identity in the partial 16S rRNA gene to a human hemoplasma (Candidatus Mycoplasma haemohominis). Additional analysis of the partial 23S rRNA gene allowed us to also designate two novel hemoplasma species, in Myotis elegans and Phyllostomus discolor, with the proposed names Candidatus Mycoplasma haematomyotis sp. nov. and Candidatus Mycoplasma haematophyllostomi sp. nov., respectively.

    "abstract": "ENPP1 expression correlates with poor prognosis in many cancers, and we previously discovered that ENPP1 is the dominant hydrolase of extracellular cGAMP: a cancer-cell-produced immunotransmitter that activates the anticancer STING pathway. However, ENPP1 has other catalytic activities and the molecular and cellular mechanisms contributing to its tumorigenic effects remain unclear. Here, using single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), we show that ENPP1 overexpression drives primary breast tumor growth and metastasis by synergistically dampening extracellular cGAMP-STING mediated antitumoral immunity and activating immunosuppressive extracellular adenosine (eADO) signaling. In addition to cancer cells, stromal and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) also express ENPP1 that restrains their response to tumor-derived cGAMP. Enpp1 loss-of-function in both cancer cells and normal tissues slowed primary tumor initiation and growth and prevented metastasis in an extracellular cGAMP- and STING-dependent manner. Selectively abolishing the cGAMP hydrolysis activity of ENPP1 phenocopied total ENPP1 knockout, demonstrating that restoration of paracrine cGAMP-STING signaling is the dominant anti-cancer mechanism of ENPP1 inhibition. Strikingly, we find that breast cancer patients with low ENPP1 expression have significantly higher immune infiltration and improved response to therapeutics impacting cancer immunity upstream or downstream of the cGAMP-STING pathway, like PARP inhibitors and anti-PD1. Altogether, selective inhibition of ENPP1s cGAMP hydrolase activity alleviates an innate immune checkpoint to boost cancer immunity and is therefore a promising therapeutic approach against breast cancer that may synergize with other cancer immunotherapies.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophage lambda tunes its propensity to lysogenize based on the number of viral genome copies inside the infected cell. Viral self-counting is believed to serve as a way of inferring the abundance of available hosts in the environment. This interpretation is premised on an accurate mapping between the extracellular phage-to-bacteria ratio and the intracellular multiplicity of infection (MOI). However, here we show this premise to be untrue. By simultaneously labeling phage capsids and genomes, we find that, while the number of phages landing on each cell reliably samples the population ratio, the number of phages entering the cell does not. Single-cell infections, followed in a microfluidic device and interpreted using a stochastic model, reveal that the probability and rate of individual phage entries decrease with MOI. This decrease reflects an MOI-dependent perturbation to host physiology caused by phage landing, evidenced by compromised membrane integrity and loss of membrane potential. The dependence of phage entry dynamics on the surrounding medium is found to result in a strong impact of environmental conditions on the infection outcome, while the protracted entry of co-infecting phages increases the cell-to-cell variability in infection outcome at a given MOI. Our findings demonstrate the previously unappreciated role played by entry dynamics in determining the outcome of bacteriophage infection.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARYZoledronic acid (ZA) prevents muscle weakness in mice with bone metastases; however, its role in muscle weakness in non-tumor-associated metabolic bone diseases and as an effective treatment modality for the prevention of muscle weakness associated with bone disorders, is unknown. We demonstrate the role of ZA-treatment on bone and muscle using a mouse model of accelerated bone remodeling, which represents the clinical manifestation of non-tumor associated metabolic bone disease. ZA increased bone mass and strength and rescued osteocyte lacunocanalicular organization. Short-term ZA treatment increased muscle mass, whereas prolonged, preventive treatment improved muscle mass and function. In these mice, muscle fiber-type shifted from oxidative to glycolytic and ZA restored normal muscle fiber distribution. By blocking TGF{beta} release from bone, ZA improved muscle function, promoted myoblast differentiation and stabilized Ryanodine Receptor-1 calcium channel. These data demonstrate the beneficial effects of ZA in maintaining bone health and preserving muscle mass and function in a model of metabolic bone disease.\n\nContext and significanceTGF{beta} is a bone regulatory molecule which is stored in bone matrix, released during bone remodeling, and must be maintained at an optimal level for the good health of the bone. Excess TGF{beta} causes several bone disorders and skeletal muscle weakness. Reducing excess TGF{beta} release from bone using zoledronic acid in mice not only improved bone volume and strength but also increased muscle mass, and muscle function. Progressive muscle weakness coexists with bone disorders, decreasing quality of life and increasing morbidity and mortality. Currently, there is a critical need for treatments improving muscle mass and function in patients with debilitating weakness. Zoledronic acids benefit extends beyond bone and could also be useful in treating muscle weakness associated with bone disorders.",

Our aim is to define the contribution of eosinophils in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), since their role in ESCC is unknown.\n\nMethodsEosinophils were enumerated in tissues from two ESCC cohorts. Mice were treated with 4-nitroquinolone-1-oxide (4-NQO) for 8 weeks to induce pre-cancer or 16 weeks to induce carcinoma. Eosinophil number was modified by monoclonal antibody to IL-5 (IL5mAb), recombinant IL-5 (rIL-5), or genetically with eosinophil-deficient ({Delta}dblGATA) mice or mice deficient in eosinophil chemoattractant eotaxin-1 (Ccl11-/-). Esophageal tissue and eosinophil specific RNA-sequencing was performed to understand eosinophil function. 3-D co-culturing of eosinophils with pre-cancer or cancer cells was done to ascertain direct effects of eosinophils.\n\nResultsActivated eosinophils are present in higher numbers in early stage versus late stage ESCC. Mice treated with 4-NQO exhibit more esophageal eosinophils in pre-cancer versus cancer. Correspondingly, epithelial cell Ccl11 expression is higher in mice with pre-cancer. Eosinophil depletion using three mouse models (Ccl11-/- mice, {Delta}dblGATA mice, IL5mAb treatment) all display exacerbated 4-NQO tumorigenesis. Conversely, treatment with rIL-5 increases esophageal eosinophilia and protects against pre-cancer and carcinoma. Tissue and eosinophil RNA-sequencing revealed eosinophils drive oxidative stress in pre-cancer. In vitro co-culturing of eosinophils with pre-cancer or cancer cells resulted in increased apoptosis in the presence of a degranulating agent, which is reversed with N-acetylcysteine, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger. {Delta}dblGATA mice exhibited increased CD4 T cell infiltration, IL-17, and enrichment of IL-17 pro-tumorigenic pathways.\n\nConclusionEosinophils likely protect against ESCC through ROS release during degranulation and suppression of IL-17.",

    "abstract": "The intercellular space comprising the plant apoplast harbors a diverse range of microorganisms. The apoplastic interface represents the main compartment for interactions between proteins produced and secreted by the plant and the microbial endophytes. The outcomes of these interactions can play a role in plant cell wall metabolism, stress tolerance, and plant-pathogen resistance. So far the underlying factors that determine microbiota composition in the apoplast are not fully understood. However, it is considered that cell wall composition, nutrient availability, and the plant immune system are main determinants of microbiota composition. The plant immune system is considered to play a crucial role in modulating microbiota composition through the recognition of specific microbe-associated molecular patterns and the activation of defense responses. Hereby the plant may restrict non-beneficial microbial members and facilitate the propagation of beneficial ones. In this study, we investigated changes in the apoplastic environment during pathogen invasion using wheat as a model system. Infection of wheat with Zymoseptoria tritici, a fungal pathogen, resulted in notable alterations in the apoplast composition, reduced microbial diversity, and the accumulation of antimicrobial defense metabolites. Intriguingly, certain core microbial members persisted even in the presence of pathogen-induced immune responses, indicating their ability to evade or tolerate host immune defenses. To further explore these dynamics, we developed a protocol for extracting apoplastic fluids from wheat leaves and conducted proteome analyses to characterize the dynamic environment of the wheat leaves. Our findings uncovered a highly variable apoplastic environment that selects for microbes with specific adaptations. Notably, a core microbial community enriched in the resistant wheat cultivar exhibited antagonistic activity against Z. tritici, suggesting a potential role in conferring pathogen defense. This study advances our understanding of the dynamic interactions and adaptations of the wheat apoplastic microbiota during pathogen invasion, emphasizing the pivotal role of microbial interactions in pathogen defenses.",

    "abstract": "Fungal infections are of mounting global concern, and the current limited treatment arsenal poses challenges when treating such infections. In particular, infections by Cryptococcus neoformans are associated with high mortality, emphasizing the need for novel therapeutic options. Calcineurin is a protein phosphatase that mediates fungal stress responses, and calcineurin inhibition by the natural product FK506 blocks C. neoformans growth at 37{degrees}C. Calcineurin is also required for pathogenesis. However, because calcineurin is conserved in humans, and inhibition with FK506 results in immunosuppression, the use of FK506 as an anti-infective agent is precluded. We previously elucidated the structures of multiple fungal calcineurin-FK506-FKBP12 complexes and implicated the C-22 position on FK506 as a key point for differential modification of ligand inhibition of the mammalian versus fungal target proteins. Through in vitro antifungal and immunosuppressive testing of FK520 (a natural analog of FK506) derivatives, we identified JH-FK-08 as a lead candidate for further antifungal development. JH-FK-08 exhibited significantly reduced immunosuppressive activity and both reduced fungal burden and prolonged survival of infected animals. JH-FK-08 exhibited additive activity in combination with fluconazole in vivo. These findings further advance calcineurin inhibition as an antifungal therapeutic approach.\n\nImportanceFungal infections cause significant morbidity and mortality globally. The therapeutic armamentarium against these infections is limited and development of antifungal drugs has been hindered by the evolutionary conservation between fungi and the human host. With rising resistance to the current antifungal arsenal and an increasing at-risk population, there is an urgent need for the development of new antifungal compounds. The FK520 analogs described in this study display potent antifungal activity as a novel class of antifungals centered on modifying an existing orally-active FDA approved therapy. This research advances the development of much needed newer antifungal treatment options with novel mechanisms of action.",

    "abstract": "Quorum sensing (QS) is a chemical communication process that bacteria use to track population density and orchestrate collective behaviors. QS relies on the production, accumulation, and group-wide detection of extracellular signal molecules called autoinducers. Vibriophage 882 (phage VP882), a bacterial virus, encodes a homolog of the Vibrio QS receptor-transcription factor, called VqmA, that monitors the Vibrio QS autoinducer DPO. Phage VqmA binds DPO at high host-cell density and activates transcription of the phage gene qtip. Qtip, an antirepressor, launches the phage lysis program. Phage-encoded VqmA when bound to DPO also manipulates host QS by activating transcription of the host gene vqmR. VqmR is a small RNA that controls downstream QS target genes. Here, we sequence Vibrio parahaemolyticus strain O3:K6 882, the strain from which phage VP882 was initially isolated. The chromosomal region normally encoding vqmR and vqmA harbors a deletion encompassing vqmR and a portion of the vqmA promoter, inactivating that QS system. We discover that V. parahaemolyticus strain O3:K6 882 is also defective in its other QS systems, due to a mutation in luxO, encoding the central QS transcriptional regulator LuxO. Both the vqmR-vqmA and luxO mutations lock V. parahaemolyticus strain O3:K6 882 into the low-cell density QS state. Reparation of the QS defects in V. parahaemolyticus strain O3:K6 882 promotes activation of phage VP882 lytic gene expression and LuxO is primarily responsible for this effect. Phage VP882-infected QS-competent V. parahaemolyticus strain O3:K6 882 cells lyse more rapidly and produce more viral particles than the QS-deficient parent strain. We propose that, in V. parahaemolyticus strain O3:K6 882, constitutive maintenance of the low-cell density QS state suppresses the launch of the phage VP882 lytic cascade, thereby protecting the bacterial host from phage-mediated lysis.",

    "abstract": "ISG20 is an interferon-induced 3-to-5 RNA exonuclease that acts as a broad antiviral factor. At present, the features that expose RNA to ISG20 remain unclear, although recent studies have pointed to the modulatory role of epitranscriptomic modifications in the susceptibility of target RNAs to ISG20. These findings raise the question as to how cellular RNAs, on which these modifications are abundant, cope with ISG20. To obtain an unbiased perspective on this topic, we used RNAseq and biochemical assays to identify elements that regulate the behavior of RNAs against ISG20. The results we have obtained indicate that poly(A)-binding protein (PABP1) loading on the RNA 3 tail provides a primal protection against ISG20, easily explaining the overall protection of cellular mRNAs observed by RNAseq. The second element we uncovered is provided by terminal stem-loop RNA structures, that have been associated to ISG20 protection before, but that we re-examine here systematically to define the stabilities that tilt the balance between resistance and susceptibility to ISG20. Given that these elements are present on cellular mRNAs, but can be co-opted by viruses as well, these results shed new light on the complex interplay that regulates the susceptibility of different classes of viruses against ISG20.",

    "abstract": "Parasitic helminths influence the composition of the gut microbiome. However, the microbiomes of individuals living in helminth-endemic regions are understudied. The Orang Asli, an indigenous population in Malaysia with high burdens of the helminth Trichuris trichiura, displayed microbiotas enriched in Clostridiales, an order of spore-forming obligate anaerobes previously shown to have immunogenic properties. We previously isolated novel Clostridiales that were enriched in these individuals and found that a subset promoted the Trichuris life cycle. Here, we further characterized the functional properties of these bacteria. Enzymatic and metabolomic profiling revealed a range of activities associated with metabolism and host response. Consistent with this finding, monocolonization of mice with individual isolates identified bacteria that were potent inducers of regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation in the colon. Comparisons between variables revealed by these studies identified enzymatic properties correlated with Treg induction and Trichuris egg hatching. These results provide functional insights into the microbiotas of an understudied population.",

    "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate nearly every physiological process but our understanding of exactly how they function remains incomplete, particularly in the context of viral infection. Target prediction models are built on canonical miRNA interactions with 3untranslated regions (3UTRs) and post-transcriptional gene suppression, leaving a gap in knowledge on other types of targets and capacity for direct interactions with viral genomes. Here we adapt a biochemical method to globally identify targets of human miRNAs in lung cells including scope for direct interactions with Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). We show that RSV binds miR-26, miR-27, and let-7, leading to de-repression of miRNA targets associated with cell cycle regulation and immune signalling. Using our bioinformatics pipeline to determine high confidence targets in the human genome we further discover that pseudogenes which overlap transcriptional regulatory regions are functional miRNA targets. We identify and validate an interaction between miR-27 and a pseudogene-derived lncRNA that regulates transcription of Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1). This work demonstrates that RSV directly interacts with host miRNAs to de-regulate host gene expression and provides biochemical support for the ability of miRNAs to directly regulate gene transcription linked to immune signalling.",

    "abstract": "Sobemovirus ryegrass mottle virus (RGMoV) is a single-stranded positive virus with a 30 nm viral particle size. It exhibits T=3 symmetry, with 180 coat protein (CP) subunits forming the virus structure. The RGMoV genome comprises five open reading frames, encoding P1, Px, a membrane-anchored 3C-like serine protease, a virus genome-linked protein, P16, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and a coat protein. The RGMoV genome size varies, ranging from 4175 nt (MW411579.1) to 4253 nt (MW411579.1) in deposited sequences. An earlier deposited RGMoV complete genome sequence of 4212 nt length (EF091714.1) was utilized to develop an infectious complementary DNA (icDNA) construct for in vitro gRNA transcription from the T7 promoter. However, when the transcribed gRNA was introduced to oat plants, it failed to induce viral infection. This indicated the potential absence of certain sequences in either the 5 or 3 untranslated regions (UTR) or both. To resolve this, the complete sequence of the 3 UTR was determined through 3 end RACE, while the 5 UTR was identified using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) - 5 RACE-seq. Only the icDNA vector containing both newly identified UTR sequences proved infectious, resulting in classical viral infection symptoms and subsequent propagation of progeny viruses, exhibiting the ability to cause repeated infection in oat plants after at least one passage. The successful generation of the icDNA highlights the synergistic potential of utilizing both methods when one approach alone fails. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the reliability of HTS as a method for determining the complete genome sequence of viral genomes.",

    "abstract": "Knowing a patients genetic ancestry is crucial in clinical settings, providing benefits such as tailored genetic testing, targeted health screening based on ancestral disease-predisposition rates, and personalized medication dosages. However, self-reported ancestry can be subjective, making it difficult to apply consistently. Moreover, existing approaches utilize genome sequencing data to infer ancestry at the continental level, creating the need for methods optimized for individual ancestry assignment. We present SNVstory, a method built upon three independent machine learning models for accurately inferring the sub-continental ancestry of individuals. SNVstory includes a feature-importance scheme, unique among open-source ancestral tools, which allows the user to track the ancestral signal broadcast by a given gene or locus. We apply SNVstory to a clinical dataset, comparing self-reported ethnicity and race to our inferred genetic ancestry. SNVstory represents a significant advance in methods to assign genetic ancestry, predicting ancestry across 36 different populations with high accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Modern rose (Rosa hybrida) is a recently formed interspecific hybrid and has become one of the most important and widely cultivated ornamentals. Here, we report the haplotype-resolved chromosome-scale genome assembly of the tetraploid R. hybrida  Samantha and a genome variation map of 233 Rosa accessions involving various wild species, and old and modern cultivars. The two subgenomes of  Samantha show no significant global bias in gene loss but substantial expression bias, and homoeologous exchanges are frequently observed between subgenomes. Population genomic and genomic composition analyses reveal the contributions of wild Rosa species to modern roses, and highlight that R. odorata and its derived cultivars contribute more to modern roses than R. chinensis  Old Blush. Furthermore, selective sweeps during modern rose breeding associated with major agronomic traits, including continuous flowering, floral organ identity, flower senescence, and disease resistance, are identified. This study provides insights into the genetic basis of modern rose origin and breeding history, and offers unprecedented genomic resources for rose improvement.",

    "abstract": "Cellular perturbations underlying Alzheimers disease are primarily studied in human postmortem samples and model organisms. Here we generated a single-nucleus atlas from a rare cohort of cortical biopsies from living individuals with varying degrees of Alzheimers disease pathology. We next performed a systematic cross-disease and cross-species integrative analysis to identify a set of cell states that are specific to early AD pathology. These changes-which we refer to as the Early Cortical Amyloid Response--were prominent in neurons, wherein we identified a transient state of hyperactivity preceding loss of excitatory neurons, which correlated with the selective loss of layer 1 inhibitory neurons. Microglia overexpressing neuroinflammatory-related processes also expanded as AD pathological burden increased. Lastly, both oligodendrocytes and pyramidal neurons upregulated genes associated with amyloid beta production and processing during this early hyperactive phase. Our integrative analysis provides an organizing framework for targeting circuit dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and amyloid production early in AD pathogenesis.",
