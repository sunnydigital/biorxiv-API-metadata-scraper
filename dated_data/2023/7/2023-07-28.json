    "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique which was found to have a positive modulatory effect on online sequence acquisition or offline motor consolidation, depending on the relative role of the associated brain region. Primary motor regions (M1) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC) have both been related to sequential learning. However, research so far did not systematically disentangle their differential roles in online and offline learning especially in more complex sequential paradigms. In this study, the influence of M1-tDCS and DLPFC-tDCS on complex sequential learning (online and offline) was investigated using a complex whole body serial reaction time task (CWB-SRTT) in 42 healthy volunteers. TDCS groups did not differ from sham tDCS group regarding their total time to complete the sequence and reaction time (online) and also not in terms of over-night consolidation (offline). Results may be related to unspecific parameters such as timing of the stimulation or current intensity but can also be attributed to the relative role of M1 and DLPFC during early complex learning. Future studies should consider investigating neural parameters during early complex CWB-SRTT learning to gain information on changes in neural activation within sequence acquisition with a specific focus on M1 and DLPFC.",

    "abstract": "Applying artificial skin stretch with force feedback increases perceived stiffness and affects grip force. We explored if participants perceptual responses in a stiffness discrimination task could be predicted solely from their action signals using models and artificial neural networks. Successful prediction could indicate a relation between participants perception and action. We found that the skin stretch perceptual augmentation could be predicted to an extent from action signals alone. We predicted the general trend of increased predicted augmentation for increased real augmentation, and average augmentation effect across participants, but not the precise effect sizes of individual participants. This indicates some relation between participants perceptual reports and action signals, enabling the partial prediction. Furthermore, of the action signals examined, grip force was necessary for predicting the augmentation effect, and a motion signal (e.g., position) was needed for predicting human-like perception, shedding light on what information may be present in the different signals.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionRecent evidence suggests that the gut plays a vital role in the development and progression of Alzheimers disease (AD) by triggering systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. The well-established rat model of AD, induced by intracerebroventricular administration of streptozotocin (STZ-icv), provides valuable insights into the GI implications of neurodegeneration. Notably, this model leads to pathophysiological changes in the gut, including redox dyshomeostasis, resulting from central neuropathology. Our study aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying gut redox dyshomeostasis and assess the effects of D-galactose, which is known to benefit gut redox homeostasis and alleviate cognitive deficits in this model.\n\nMaterials and MethodsDuodenal rings isolated from STZ-icv animals and control groups were subjected to a prooxidative environment using AAPH or H2O2 with or without D-galactose in oxygenated Krebs buffer ex vivo. Redox homeostasis was analyzed through protein microarrays and functional biochemical assays, alongside cell survival assessment. Structural equation modeling, univariate, and multivariate models were employed to evaluate the differential response of STZ-icv and control samples to the controlled prooxidative challenge.\n\nResultsSTZ-icv samples showed suppressed expression of catalase and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and increased baseline activity of enzymes involved in H2O2 and superoxide homeostasis. The altered redox homeostasis status was associated with an inability to respond to oxidative challenges and D-galactose. Conversely, the presence of D-galactose increased antioxidant capacity, enhanced catalase and peroxidase activity, and upregulated superoxide dismutases in the control samples.\n\nConclusionSTZ-icv-induced gut dysfunction is characterized by a diminished ability of the redox regulatory system to maintain long-term protection through the transcription of antioxidant response genes, as well as compromised activation of enzymes responsible for immediate antioxidant defense. D-galactose can exert beneficial effects on gut redox homeostasis under physiological conditions.",

    "abstract": "A number of recent studies have sought to understand the behavior of artificial and biological neural networks by comparing representations across layers, networks and brain areas. Simultaneously, there has been growing interest in using dimensionality of a dataset as a proxy for computational complexity. At the intersection of these topics, studies exploring the dimensionality of shared computational and representational subspaces have relied on model-based methods, but a standard, model-free measure is lacking. Here we present a candidate measure for shared dimensionality that we call the effective number of shared dimensions (ENSD). The ENSD can be applied to data matrices sharing at least one dimension, reduces to the well-known participation ratio when both data sets are equivalent and has a number of other robust and intuitive mathematical properties. Notably, the ENSD can be written as a similarity metric that is a re-scaled version of centered kernel alignment (CKA) but additionally describes the dimensionality of the aligned subspaces. Unlike methods like canonical correlation analysis (CCA), the ENSD is robust to cases where data is sparse or low rank. We demonstrate its utility and computational efficiency by a direct comparison of CKA and ENSD on across-layer similarities in convolutional neural networks as well as by recovering results from recent studies in neuroscience on communication subspaces between brain regions. Finally, we demonstrate how the ENSD and its constituent statistics allow us to perform a variety of multi-modal analyses of multivariate datasets. Specifically, we use connectomic data to probe the alignment of parallel pathways in the fly olfactory system, revealing novel results in the interaction between innate and learned olfactory representations. Altogether, we show that the ENSD is an interpretable and computationally efficient model-free measure of shared dimensionality and that it can be used to probe shared structure in a wide variety of data types.",

    "abstract": "Changes in brain oscillatory activity are commonly used as biomarkers both in cognitive neuroscience and in neuropsychiatric conditions. However, little is known about how its profile changes across maturation. Here we use regression models to characterize magnetoencephalography power changes within classical frequency bands in a sample of 792 healthy participants, covering the range 13 to 80 years old.\n\nOur results reveal complex, non-linear trajectories of power changes that challenge the linear model traditionally reported. Moreover, these trajectories also exhibit variations across cortical regions. Remarkably, we observed that increases in slow wave activity are associated with a better cognitive performance across the lifespan, as well as with larger gray matter volume for elderlies, while fast wave activity decreases with adulthood.\n\nThese results suggest that elevated power in low-frequency resting-state activity during aging may reflect a proxy for deterioration, rather than serving as a compensatory mechanism, as usually interpreted. In addition, it enhances our comprehension of both neurodevelopment and the aging process by highlighting the complexity and regional specificity of changes in brain rhythms. Furthermore, our findings have potential implications for understanding cognitive performance and structural integrity.",

    "abstract": "The thalamus is primarily known as a relay for sensory information; however, it also critically contributes to higher-order cortical processing and coordination. Thalamocortical hyperconnectivity is associated with hallucinatory phenomena that occur in various psychopathologies (e.g., psychosis, migraine aura) and altered states of consciousness (ASC, e.g., induced by psychedelic drugs). However, the exact functional contribution of thalamocortical hyperconnectivity in forming hallucinatory experiences is unclear. Flicker light stimulation (FLS) can be used as an experimental tool to induce transient visual hallucinatory phenomena in healthy participants. Here, we use FLS in combination with fMRI to test how FLS modulates thalamocortical connectivity between specific thalamic nuclei and visual areas. We show that FLS induces thalamocortical hyperconnectivity between LGN, early visual areas and proximal upstream areas of ventral and dorsal visual streams (e.g., hV4, VO1, V3a). Further, an exploratory analysis indicates specific higher-order thalamic nuclei, such as anterior and mediodorsal nuclei, to be strongly affected by FLS. Here, the connectivity changes to upstream cortical visual areas directly reflect a frequency-dependent increase in experienced visual phenomena. Together these findings contribute to the identification of specific thalamocortical interactions in the emergence of visual hallucinations.\n\nHighlightsO_LIFlicker light stimulation (FLS) induces thalamocortical hyperconnectivity between the first-order thalamic LGN and early visual cortices, likely due to entrainment.\nC_LIO_LIThalamocortical connectivity between LGN and upstream visual areas, but not V1, is associated with the intensity of visual hallucinations.\nC_LIO_LIThalamocortical connectivity changes with higher-order thalamic nuclei, such as anterior and mediodorsal nuclei, show strongest modulation by flicker frequency, which corresponds to the intensity of visual hallucinations.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Astrocytes (the main glial cells in the brain) are highly ramified and send out perivascular processes (PvAPs) that entirely sheathe the brains blood vessels. PvAPs are equipped with an enriched molecular repertoire that sustains astrocytic regulatory functions at the vascular interface. In the mouse, PvAP development starts after birth and is essentially complete by postnatal day (P) 15. Progressive molecular maturation also occurs over this period, with the acquisition of proteins enriched in PvAPs. The mechanisms controlling the development and molecular maturation of PvAPs have not been extensively characterized. We reported previously that mRNAs are distributed unequally in mature PvAPs and are locally translated. Since dynamic mRNA distribution and local translation influence the cells polarity, we hypothesized that they might sustain the postnatal maturation of PvAPs. Here, we used a combination of molecular biology and imaging approaches to demonstrate that the development of PvAPs is accompanied by the transport of mRNA and polysomal mRNA into PvAPs, the development of a rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) network and Golgi cisternae, and local translation. By focusing on genes and proteins that are selectively or specifically expressed in astrocytes, we characterized the developmental profile of mRNAs, polysomal mRNAs and proteins in PvAPs from P5 to P60. Furthermore, we found that distribution of mRNAs in PvAPs is perturbed in a mouse model of megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts. Lastly, we found that some polysomal mRNAs polarized progressively towards the PvAPs. Our results indicate that dynamic mRNA distribution and local translation influence the postnatal maturation of PvAPs.\n\nSummary statementLocal translation operates during the postnatal development of perivascular astrocyte processes and might contribute to their molecular maturation.",

    "abstract": "The ability to perceive biological motion (BM) is crucial for human survival and social interaction. Plentiful studies have found impaired BM perception in autism spectrum disorder characterized by deficits in social interaction. Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often exhibit similar deficits in social interaction, but few studies have investigated BM perception in ADHD. Here, we compared the differences in abilities to process local kinematic and global configurational cues, two fundamental abilities of BM perception, between typically developing (TD) and ADHD children. Then, we further investigated the relationship between BM perception and social interaction skills measured by the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and examined the contributions of potential factors (e.g., gender, age, attention and intelligence) to BM perception. Results revealed that children with ADHD exhibited atypical BM perception with a clear dissociation between local and global BM information processing. Local BM processing ability was largely related to social interaction skills, whereas global BM processing ability would significantly improve with age. Critically, general BM perception (i.e., both local and global BM cues) was affected by sustained attention ability in ADHD. This relationship was mainly mediated by Reasoning Intelligence. These findings elucidate the atypical biological motion perception in ADHD and the potential factors related to BM perception. Moreover, this study provides new evidence for local BM perception as a hallmark of social cognition and advances the comprehensive understanding of the distinct roles of local and global processing in BM perception and social cognitive disorders.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDespite advances in therapy, inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system, such as multiple sclerosis, remain important causes of morbidity among young adults. Translation of remyelinating paradigms from current murine models is encumbered by the small size and low white matter content of the brains, limiting the spatial resolution of diagnostic imaging. Large animal models might be more suited for this purpose but pose significant technological, ethical and logistical challenges.\n\nMethodWe induced reversible and targeted cerebral demyelinating lesions by controlled injection of lysophosphatidylcholine in the minipig brain. One strength of the approach is the serial induction, allowing parallel imaging of successive stages of de-/remyelination.\n\nFindingsWe demonstrate controlled, clinically unapparent, reversible and multimodally trackable brain white matter demyelination in a large animal model. Lesions were amenable to follow-up using the same clinical imaging modalities (3T magnetic resonance imaging, 11C-PIB positron emission tomography) and standard histopathology protocols as for human diagnostics, as well as electron microscopy to compare against biopsy data from two patients with cerebral demyelination.\n\nInterpretationBy employing human diagnostic tools and validating the model against data from related human diseases, our platform overcomes one important translational barrier of current animal brain demyelination models while having the potential for developing diagnostic procedures and imaging biomarkers. Remyelination and axon preservation dynamics diverge from classical rodent models.\n\nFundingThis work was supported by the DFG under Germanys Excellence Strategy within the framework of the Munich Cluster for Systems Neurology (EXC 2145 SyNergy, ID 390857198) and TRR 274/1 2020, 408885537 (projects B03 and Z01).\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSInflammatory demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), targeting primarily the white matter (WM) of the brain and spinal cord, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), still represent some of the most important non-traumatic causes of disability in young adults. Current animal models based on murine species, for example, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, have been demonstrated to reliably depict pathophysiological facets of human disease. However, they are nevertheless encumbered by the low WM content and the small size of murine brains, which still pose a translational barrier to diagnostic imaging tools used in a clinical context in human patients. Minipigs are increasingly being used to model human neurological diseases, as yet primarily in the context of neurodegenerative disorders.\n\nAdded value of this studyHere, we establish a platform for Minipig Stereotactic White-matter Injection using Navigation by Electromagnetism (MiniSWINE) and validate such a tool in a clinical multimodal imaging and microscopy setting against biopsy and imaging data from human demyelinating disorders across different disease stages, as well as against existing and potentially emerging human diagnostic imaging. Moreover, in order to overcome the neuroanatomical challenges of stereotactic injection in the pig brain, we designed a new electromagnetic-guided tracking system whose key advantage is the direct measurement of the injection cannula tip position in situ. Another strength of our study lies in its setup, characterized by the serial induction of successive stages of de- and remyelination, allowing for multimodal assessment via imaging and histopathology or electron microscopy of multiple stages in parallel. The remyelination dynamics inferred in this context diverge from the classical rodent studies, by exhibiting incomplete remyelination at the subacute stage, persistent astroglial and microglial activation as well as a minor degree of secondary axonal degeneration. Thus, they more closely resemble human inflammatory demyelinating brain plaques.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceWe believe that MiniSWINE links evidence from well-established demyelination-induction methods from rodent models of CNS demyelinating disorders, as well as from human imaging and biopsy data, while at the same time providing a novel platform for the potential development of diagnostic procedures, discovery of imaging biomarkers and testing of remyelinating agents in diseases such as MS. Thus, it can have particular relevance to human health in the context of future translational animal model-based research in inflammatory demyelinating disorders of the CNS. Additionally, our electromagnetic-guided injection technique may enhance stereotactic substance delivery in human neurosurgery.",

Here, we exploited the fact that macaque monkeys experience robust saccadic inhibition to test the hypothesis that inhibition time and strength exhibit systematic visual feature tuning properties to a multitude of visual feature dimensions commonly used in vision science. We measured saccades in three monkeys actively controlling their gaze on a target, and we presented visual onset events at random times. Across six experiments, the visual onsets tested size, spatial frequency, contrast, motion direction, and motion speed dependencies of saccadic inhibition. We also investigated how inhibition might depend on the behavioral relevance of the appearing stimuli. We found that saccadic inhibition starts earlier, and is stronger, for large stimuli of low spatial frequencies and high contrasts. Moreover, saccadic inhibition timing depends on motion direction, with earlier inhibition systematically occurring for horizontally than for vertically drifting gratings. On the other hand, saccadic inhibition is stronger for faster motions, and when the appearing stimuli are subsequently foveated. Besides documenting a range of feature tuning dimensions of saccadic inhibition on the properties of exogenous visual stimuli, our results establish macaque monkeys as an ideal model system for unraveling the neural mechanisms underlying a highly ubiquitous oculomotor phenomenon in visual neuroscience.\n\nNew and noteworthyVisual onsets dramatically reduce saccade generation likelihood with very short latencies. Such latencies suggest that stimulus-induced visual responses, normally jumpstarting perceptual and scene analysis processes, can also directly impact the decision of whether to generate saccades or not, causing saccadic inhibition. Consistent with this, we found that changing the appearance of the visual onsets systematically alters the properties of saccadic inhibition. These results constrain neurally-inspired models of coordination between saccade generation and exogenous sensory stimulation.",

Noninvasive in vivo profiling of -syn aggregate accumulation and microgliosis by molecular imaging can provide insights on the underlying mechanisms of disease progression, facilitating the development of effective treatment. However, no classical imaging methods have been successful, despite several attempts. We demonstrate a novel method to noninvasive in vivo profiling of pathologic -syn in combination with microgliosis using molecular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), by targeting oligomeric -syn in cerebrospinal fluid with nano scavengers (T) bearing a T1-relaxive Gd(III) payload. In this proof-of-concept report we demonstrate, in vitro, that microglia and neuroblastoma cell lines internalize cross-linked T/oligomeric -syn agglomerates. Delayed in vivo T1-weighted MRI scans following intravenous administration in the M83 -syn transgenic mouse line show statistically significant T1 signal enhancement in test mice versus controls. The in vivo data was validated by ex-vivo immunohistochemical analysis which showed a strong correlation between in vivo MRI signal enhancement, Lewy pathology distribution, and microglia activity in the treated brain tissue. Furthermore, neuronal, and microglial cells in brain tissue from treated mice displayed strong cytosolic signal originating from T, confirming in vivo cell uptake of the nano scavengers.",

    "abstract": "Bovine colostrum (COL), the first milk secreted by lactating cows postpartum, is a rich source of bioactive compounds that exert significant role on the survival, growth, and immune development of neonatal calves [9,10]. This study investigated the immunomodulatory effects of COL on cytokine production in vitro using a Caco-2/THP-1 macrophage co-culture model stimulated with Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). COL pretreatment significantly reduced IL-6 production induced by PMA, while increasing IL-10 production. Further investigations revealed that the IL-6 suppressive effect of colostrum was heat-sensitive and associated with components of higher molecular mass (100 kDa). Moreover, colostrum primarily influenced THP-1 macrophages rather than Caco-2 epithelial cells. The effects of colostrum on IL-6 production were associated with reduced NF-{kappa}B activation in THP-1 macrophages. In calf-FMT transplanted C57BL/6 murine model, colostrum decreased intestinal permeability, reduced immune cell infiltration, and suppressed IL-6 production during S. typhimurium infection.

    "abstract": "Fine-scale resolution of spatial genetic structure is important for understanding a species evolutionary history and contemporary genetic diversity. For high-latitude species with high dispersal ability, such as long-distance migratory birds, populations typically exhibit little genetic structure due to high gene flow and recent postglacial expansion. Some migratory birds, however, show high breeding site fidelity, which might reduce gene flow such that population genetic structure could be detectable with sufficient genomic data. We sequenced over 120 low-coverage whole genomes from across the breeding range of a long-distance migratory bird, the Veery (Catharus fuscescens). As this species breeding range extends across both historically glaciated and unglaciated regions in North America, we evaluated whether contemporary patterns of structure and genetic diversity are consistent with historical population isolation in glacial refugia. We found strong evidence for isolation by distance across the breeding range, as well as significant population structure between southern Appalachian and northern populations. However, patterns of genetic diversity did not support southern Appalachia as a glacial refugium. Resolution of isolation by distance across the breeding range was sufficient to assign likely breeding origins of individuals sampled in this species poorly understood South American nonbreeding range, demonstrating the potential to assess migratory connectivity in this species using genomic data. Overall, our findings suggest that isolation by distance yields subtle associations between genetic structure and geography across the breeding range even in the absence of obvious historical vicariance or contemporary barriers to dispersal.",

Linking two disparate fields by their common use and application of the preservative formaldehyde, we present an approach to characterise chromatin architecture in formaldehyde-preserved specimens up to 117 years old. We characterise how over-fixation modulates but does not eliminate genome-wide patterns of differential chromatin accessibility. Our novel analytical approach identifies promoter regions enriched for gene ontology terms matching the tissue of origin, resulting in sex-specific and environment-dependent genome-wide profiles. Contrary to prevailing dogma, we show that over-fixation is essential for the successful recovery of historical chromatin architecture.

    "abstract": "High-grade endometrial cancer, like numerous other cancer types, exhibits clear racial disparities in the United States for both the incidence and outcomes of the disease. While institutional factors are likely the primary contributor to these disparities, other underlying causes cannot be ignored (i.e., molecular, genetic, and histopathologic factors). This study seeks to interrogate the role that germline genetic influences, specifically genetic ancestry, may play in contributing to characteristics of high-grade endometrial cancer. This is mainly accomplished by examining the relationship between local ancestry inferences and somatic mutation frequency as well as histologic subtypes. An association between clinical characteristics and patient survival was also interrogated, and while global ancestry was seen to have no significant effect, tumor mutation burden (TMB) did impact patient survival. Here, we identify associations between local ancestry segments on chromosomes 1 and 14 and an increased TMB in self-described (SD) Black patients. We also highlight a complex relationship between heterozygous ancestry combinations within genomic regions (i.e., [European/African] vs. [African/African]) and an increase in local somatic mutation frequency.\n\nFurthermore, we explore the relationship between local ancestry and histologic subtype. We identify one region (chr9q32) wherein the African/European local ancestry diplotype was associated with a higher incidence of serous carcinoma. We also underline a difference in somatic mutation frequency between endometrioid and serous carcinoma. While highly exploratory, these findings begin to characterize the complex relationship between genetic ancestry and characteristics of high-grade endometrial cancer, which may impact patient survival.",

    "abstract": "Marigold (Tagetes erecta L.) is a popular ornamental plant of the Asteraceae family, and its petals are considered the most abundant source of lutein. A low-continuity chromosome-level genome sequence of marigold was published recently, with poor annotation of the protein-coding genes, which hinders the studies of lutein biosynthesis. Here, we generated a near telomere-to-telomere level genome assembly of marigold based on highly accurate high-fidelity (HiFi) long reads and Hi-C sequencing data. Compared to the previously reported marigold genome, the current assembly had obviously higher contiguity and higher completeness of gene set. The current genome assembly has a 27-fold increase in contig N50 size, a 12.1% increase in chromosome anchoring rate, and a 9.0% increase in BUSCO complete rate for the gene set. Besides, the current assembly has much fewer assembly errors. Based on this high-quality genome assembly, we found that the 170-bp repeats are the most abundant centromeric unit and all centromeric regions are distributed along the whole chromosomes for all 12 centromeres, indicating the existence of the holocentromeres in marigold. In addition, we analyzed the structure and phylogenetic relationship of the four PSY genes, and revealed that these genes have diversified and possibly executed different functions in various tissues. Our near telomere-to-telomere level genome assembly and comprehensive gene annotation will greatly facilitate the breeding of marigold and researches aimed at improving lutein production.",

Studies have examined genetic and environmentally induced variations in resource utility and their ecological implications. However, few have explored developmental noise or instability as a factor contributing to variation in resource utility. Here, we studied genetic variation, and developmental noise in foraging traits of Drosophila lutescens, a wild fruit fly. Using 70 iso-female lines from a single population, we observed two foraging behavior traits - locomotive activity and resource preferences - in an experimental \"8\"-shaped arena with two different fruit juices in each chamber. The mean locomotive speed and relative preference for orange juice over grape juice varied significantly among iso-female lines, indicating genetic variation in foraging behavior. Additionally, the degree of variation within iso-female lines also varied, showing relatively higher heritability. While the locomotive speed and resource preferences of each line did not correlate with each other, the strength of variation within iso-female lines for locomotive speed showed a significant correlation with that for resource preferences. This suggests that the degree of developmental noise in both locomotive activity and resource preferences is governed by a shared genetic basis. Consequently, developmental noise can contribute to increased phenotypic variation in resource utility within a population and may evolve through natural selection.",

Local activation of the {beta}2 integrin initiates inter-cellular adhesion, while global soluble inhibitory factors maintain the steady-state domain pattern over days. Patterned domain formation generated by monocytes is unique among other key immune cells, including macrophages, B cells, T cells, and NK cells. While inhibiting their phagocytic capability, domain formation promotes monocytes survival. We develop a computational model based on the Cahn-Hilliard equation, which includes combined local activation and global inhibition mechanisms of intercellular adhesion suggested by our experiments, and provides experimentally validated predictions of the role of seeding density and both chemotactic and random cell migration on pattern formation.",

We observed dramatic nutrient-dependent changes in sensitivity to a variety of FDA-approved and clinically trialed compounds, including rigosertib, an experimental cancer therapeutic that has recently failed in phase 3 clinical trials. Mechanistically, we found that the ability of rigosertib to destabilize microtubules is strongly inhibited by the purine metabolism waste product uric acid, which is uniquely abundant in humans relative to traditional in vitro and in vivo cancer models. Structural modelling studies suggest that uric acid interacts with the tubulin-rigosertib complex and may act as an uncompetitive inhibitor of rigosertib. These results offer a possible explanation for the failure of rigosertib in clinical trials and demonstrate the utility of physiological media to achieve in vitro results that better represent human therapeutic responses.",

    "abstract": "The application of deep learning is rapidly transforming the field of bioimage analysis. While deep learning has shown great promise in complex microscopy tasks such as single-cell segmentation, the development of generalizable foundation deep learning segmentation models is hampered by the scarcity of large and diverse annotated datasets of cell images for training purposes. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can generate realistic images that can potentially be easily used to train deep learning models without the generation of large manually annotated microscopy images. Here, we propose a customized CycleGAN architecture to train an enhanced cell segmentation model with limited annotated cell images, effectively addressing the challenge of paucity of annotated data in microscopy imaging. Our customized CycleGAN model can generate realistic synthetic images of cells with morphological details and nuances very similar to that of real images. This method not only increases the variability seen during training but also enhances the authenticity of synthetic samples, thereby enhancing the overall predictive accuracy and robustness of the cell segmentation model. Our experimental results show that our CycleGAN-based method significantly improves the performance of the segmentation model compared to conventional training techniques. Interestingly, we demonstrate that our model can extrapolate its knowledge by synthesizing imaging scenarios that were not seen during the training process. Our proposed customized CycleGAN method will accelerate the development of foundation models for cell segmentation in microscopy images.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the heterogeneity of the immune cell compartment within the steady-state murine and human CNS. However it is not known whether this diversity is conserved among non mammalian vertebrates, especially in the zebrafish, a model system with increasing translational value. Here, we reveal the complexity of the immune landscape of the adult zebrafish brain. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we characterized these different immune cell subpopulations, including cell types that have not been -or have been poorly-characterized in zebrafish so far. By histology, we found that, despite microglia being the main immune cell type in the parenchyma, the zebrafish brain is also populated by a distinct myeloid population that shares a gene signature with mammalian dendritic cells (DC). Notably, zebrafish DC-like cells rely on batf3, a gene essential for the development of conventional DC1 in the mouse. Using specific fluorescent reporter lines that allowed us to reliably discriminate DC-like cells from microglia, we quantified brain myeloid cell defects in commonly used irf8-/-, csf1ra-/- and csf1rb-/- mutant fish, revealing previously unappreciated distinct microglia and DC-like phenotypes. Overall, our results suggest a conserved heterogeneity of brain immune cells across vertebrate evolution and also highlights zebrafish-specific brain immunity characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Apathy is a common and disabling complication of Parkinsons disease characterised by reduced goal-directed behaviour. Several studies have reported dysfunction within pre-frontal cortical regions and projections from brainstem nuclei whose neuromodulators include dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline. Work in animal and human neuroscience have confirmed contributions of these neuromodulators on aspects of motivated decision making. Specifically, non-dopaminergic neuromodulators, influence decisions to explore alternative courses of action or persist in an existing strategy to achieve a rewarding goal.\n\nBuilding upon this work, we hypothesised that Apathy in Parkinsons disease should be associated with a failure to adequately monitor and make adaptive choices when the rewarding outcome of decisions are uncertain. Using a 4-armed restless bandit reinforcement learning task, we studied decision making in 75 volunteers; 53 patients with Parkinsons disease, with and without clinical apathy, and 22 age matched healthy controls. Patients with Apathy exhibited impaired ability to choose the highest value bandit. Task performance predicted an individual patients apathy severity measured using the Lille Apathy Rating scale (R = -0.46, p<0.001). Computational modelling of the patients choices confirmed the apathy group made decisions that that were indifferent to the learnt value of the options, consistent with previous reports of reward insensitivity. Further analysis demonstrated a shift away from exploiting the highest value option and a reduction in perseveration which also correlated with apathy scores (R = -0.5, p<0.001).\n\nWe went on to acquire fMRI in 59 volunteers; a group of 19 patients with and 20 without apathy and 20 age matched controls performing the restless bandit task. Analysis of the fMRI signal at the point of reward feedback confirmed diminished signal within ventromedial prefrontal cortex in Parkinsons disease, which was more marked in Apathy, but not predictive of their individual Apathy severity. Using a model-based categorisation of choice type, decisions to explore lower value bandits in the apathy group activated pre-frontal cortex to a similar degree to the age-matched controls. In contrast, Parkinsons patients without apathy demonstrated significantly increased activation across a distributed thalamo-cortical network. Enhanced activity in the thalamus predicted individual apathy severity across both patient groups and exhibited functional connectivity with dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula.\n\nGiven that task performance in patients without apathy was no different to the age-matched controls, we interpret the recruitment of this network as a possible compensatory mechanism, which compensates against symptomatic manifestation of apathy in Parkinsons disease.",

    "abstract": "The median eminence (ME), located at the base of the hypothalamus, is an essential centre of information exchange between the brain and the pituitary. We and others previously showed that mutations and duplications affecting the transcription factor SOX3/Sox3 result in hypopituitarism, and this is likely of hypothalamic origin. We demonstrate here that the absence of Sox3 predominantly affects the ME with phenotypes that first occur in juvenile animals, despite the embryonic onset of SOX3 expression. In the pituitary, reduction in hormone levels correlates with a lack of endocrine cell maturation. In parallel, ME NG2-glia renewal and oligodendrocytic differentiation potential are affected. We further show that low-dose aspirin treatment, which is known to affect NG2-glia, or changes in gut microbiota, rescue both proliferative defects and hypopituitarism in Sox3 mutants. Our study highlights a central role of NG2-glia for ME function during a transitional period of post-natal development, and indicates their sensitivity to environmental signals.",

    "abstract": "Ibogaine is a potent atypical psychedelic that has gained considerable attention due to its antiaddictive and antidepressant properties in preclinical and clinical studies. Previous research from our group showed that ibogaine suppresses sleep and produces an altered wakefulness state which resembles natural REM sleep. However, after systemic administration, ibogaine is rapidly metabolized to noribogaine, which also shows antiaddictive effects and a distinct pharmacological profile, making this drug a promising therapeutic candidate. Therefore, whether the sleep/wake alterations depend on ibogaine or its principal metabolite noribogaine remains unknown. To answer this question, we conducted polysomnographic recordings in rats following the administration of pure noribogaine. Our results show that noribogaine promotes wakefulness while reducing slow-wave sleep and blocking REM sleep. Thus, like ibogaine, noribogaine significantly alters the sleep-wake architecture, highlighting the possible role of serotonin reuptake inhibition as a likely candidate underlying the wake-promoting and REM sleep-suppressing effects.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to determine whether intraspinal microstimulation (ISMS) intended to enhance voluntary motor output after spinal cord injury (SCI) modulates neural population-level spinal responsiveness to nociceptive sensory feedback. The study was conducted in vivo in three cohorts of rats: neurologically intact, chronic SCI without behavioral signs of neuropathic pain, and chronic SCI with SCI-related neuropathic pain (SCI-NP). Nociceptive sensory feedback was induced by application of graded mechanical pressure to the plantar surface of the hindpaw before, during, and after periods of sub-motor threshold ISMS delivered within the motor pools of the L5 spinal segment. Neural population-level responsiveness to nociceptive feedback was recorded throughout the dorso-ventral extent of the L5 spinal segment using dense multi-channel microelectrode arrays. Whereas motor-targeted ISMS reduced nociceptive transmission across electrodes in neurologically intact animals both during and following stimulation, it was not associated with altered nociceptive transmission in rats with SCI that lacked behavioral signs of neuropathic pain. Surprisingly, nociceptive transmission was reduced both during and following motor-targeted ISMS in rats with SCI-NP, and to an extent comparable to that of neurologically intact animals. The mechanisms underlying the differential anti-nociceptive effects of motor-targeted ISMS are unclear, although they may be related to differences in the intrinsic active membrane properties of spinal neurons across the cohorts. Nevertheless, the results of this study support the notion that it may be possible to purposefully engineer spinal stimulation-based therapies that afford multi-modal rehabilitation benefits, and specifically that it may be possible to do so for the individuals most in need - i.e., those with SCI-related movement impairments and SCI-NP.",

This study examines the influence of vision on the perception of postural instability onset. Previous research employing Temporal Order Judgment (TOJ) tasks to investigate the perceived timing of postural perturbation onset has not incorporated visual cues.\n\nResearch questionDoes the presence of visual feedback affect the point of subjective simultaneity (PSS) between postural perturbation onset and an auditory reference stimulus and does this additional sensory cue increase TOJ precision?\n\nMethodsUsing a lean-and-release paradigm, 10 participants were exposed to postural perturbations in both eyes closed (EC) and eyes open (EO) conditions using a TOJ task where they indicated whether they perceived postural instability onset or sound onset as occurring first for each trial. Separate paired t-tests between EC and EO PSS and just noticeable difference (JND) values were used. One-sample t-tests were also used on PSS values for both conditions, comparing them to 0ms (true simultaneity).\n\nResultsThe EC condition demonstrated a perceived delay of postural instability onset by 25.78 ms, while the EO condition showed a perceived delay of the auditory stimulus by 12.33 ms. However, no significant differences were found between the conditions or in comparison to true simultaneity. Mean JND values for EC (39.88 ms) and EO (46.48 ms) were not significantly different, suggesting visual information does not affect response precision for this task under these conditions.\n\nSignificanceThese findings indicate that visual information does not significantly affect the perception of postural instability onset.

Bilirubin induced neurological damage (BIND) can result in acute or chronic bilirubin encephalopathy, causing temporary or lasting neurological dysfunction or severe damage resulting in infant death. Although serum bilirubin levels are used as an indication of severity, known and unknown individual differences affect the severity of the symptoms. The mechanisms of BIND have not been fully understood yet. Here, a zebrafish newborn hyperbilirubinemia model is developed and characterized. Direct exposure to excess bilirubin induced dose and time dependent toxicity linked to the accumulation of bilirubin in the body and brain. Introduced bilirubin was processed by liver which increased the tolerance of larvae. BIND in larvae was demonstrated by morphometric measurements, histopathological analyses and functional tests. The larvae that survived hyperbilirubinemia displayed mild or severe morphologies associated with defects in eye movements, body posture and swimming problems. Interestingly, the plethora of mild to severe clinical symptoms were reproduced in the zebrafish model.\n\nSummary statementThis alternative newborn hyperbilirubinemia model in zebrafish, reports detailed analyses of bilirubin toxicity, recovery, and bilirubin induced neurological damage in varying degrees.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe transmission of heartbeat through the cerebral vascular system is known to cause intracranial pressure pulsations. Here we describe that arterial pressure pulsations within the brain can directly modulate central neuronal activity. In a semi-intact rat brain preparation, pressure pulsations elicit correlated local field oscillations in the olfactory bulb (OB) that are sensitive to hypoxia and block of mechanosensitive channels. We find that mitral cell spiking activity is in part synchronized to these oscillations. Indeed, in awake animals the firing of a subset of OB neurons is entrained to heartbeat within [~] 20 ms. Several lines of evidence indicate the expression of a mechanosensitive ion channel within the mitral cell membranes, most likely Piezo2, implementing a pressure pulsation transduction pathway and thus baroreception within the OB. We propose that this intrinsic interoceptive mechanism modulates OB neuronal activity e.g. during arousal and also could influence brain activity on a wider scale.",

    "abstract": "Modern neurophysiological recordings are performed using multichannel sensor arrays that are able to record activity in an increasingly high number of channels numbering in the 100s to 1000s. Often, underlying lower-dimensional patterns of activity are responsible for the observed dynamics, but these representations are difficult to reliably identify using existing methods that attempt to summarize multivariate relationships in a post-hoc manner from univariate analyses, or using current blind source separation methods. While such methods can reveal appealing patterns of activity, determining the number of components to include, assessing their statistical significance, and interpreting them requires extensive manual intervention and subjective judgement in practice. These difficulties with component selection and interpretation occur in large part because these methods lack a generative model for the underlying spatio-temporal dynamics. Here we describe a novel component analysis method anchored by a generative model where each source is described by a bio-physically inspired state space representation. The parameters governing this representation readily capture the oscillatory temporal dynamics of the components, so we refer to it as Oscillation Component Analysis (OCA). These parameters - the oscillatory properties, the component mixing weights at the sensors, and the number of oscillations - all are inferred in a data-driven fashion within a Bayesian framework employing an instance of the expectation maximization algorithm. We analyze high-dimensional electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography recordings from human studies to illustrate the potential utility of this method for neuroscience data.\n\nSignificance StatementNeuroscience studies often involve simultaneous recordings in a large number of sensors in which a smaller number of dynamic components generate the complex spatio-temporal patterns observed in the data. Current blind source separation techniques produce sub-optimal results and are difficult to interpret because these methods lack an appropriate generative model that can guide both statistical inference and interpretation. Here we describe a novel component analysis method employing a dynamic generative model that can decompose high-dimensional multivariate data into a smaller set of oscillatory components are learned in a data-driven way, with parameters that are immediately interpretable. We show how this method can be applied to neurophysiological recordings with millisecond precision that exhibit oscillatory activity such as electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography.",

In this study, we investigated the postmortem brains of a cohort of AsymAD cases to gain insight into the underlying mechanisms of resilience to AD pathology and cognitive decline. Our results showed that AsymAD cases exhibit an enrichment of core plaques and decreased filamentous plaque accumulation, as well as an increase in microglia surrounding this last type. In AsymAD cases we found less pathological tau aggregation in dystrophic neurites compared to AD and tau seeding activity comparable to healthy control subjects. We used spatial transcriptomics to further characterize the plaque niche and found autophagy, endocytosis, and phagocytosis within the top upregulated pathways in the AsymAD plaque niche, but not in AD. Furthermore, we found ARP2, an actin-based motility protein crucial to initiate the formation of new actin filaments, increased within microglia in the proximity of amyloid plaques in AsymAD. Our findings support that the amyloid-plaque microenvironment in AsymAD cases is characterized by microglia with highly efficient actin-based cell motility mechanisms and decreased tau seeding compared to AD.

    "abstract": "Stem cells and neurogenesis persist in the postnatal and adult brain. Adult brain stem cells can be neuroprotective in disease and augment hippocampal-dependent cognitive function and thus are an important therapeutic target. Although many molecules have been discovered that regulate neurogenesis, few studies have attempted to amplify the process pharmacologically as a therapeutic goal. To address this gap, we used murine neurosphere cultures from the two major stem cell niches: the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the subgranular zone (SGZ). We screened compounds sharing pharmacophores with known inducers of neurogenesis and found several dozen proneurogenic compounds in an in vitro phenotypic screen. One, OXS-N1 was stable, and had acceptable absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion profiles in animal studies. OXS-N1 could increase neurogenesis in the SVZ and SGZ in WT mice after both intraperitoneal and oral administration. The number of newborn neurons (BrdU+/NeuN+) was increased; however, the number of activated stem cells (BrdU+/GFAP+) was not, suggesting an effect on neurogenesis independent of stem cell activation. This was supported by OXS-N1 increasing neurosphere differentiation but not proliferation. OXS-N1 also increased neurogenesis and improved performance in a Y maze cognitive task in PDGF-APPSw,Ind mice, a model of Alzheimers disease. RNAseq of SVZ and SGZ neurospheres in turn showed that genes associated with synaptic function were significantly increased by OXS-N1. Our study demonstrates the utility of phenotypic screening for the identification of molecules that increase neurogenesis and might be of therapeutic relevance.",

    "abstract": "REM sleep has been hypothesized to promote emotional resilience, but any neuronal circuits mediating this have not been identified. We find that in mice, somatostatin (Som) neurons in the entopeduncular nucleus (EPSom)/internal globus pallidus are predominantly active selectively during REM sleep. This unique REM activity is necessary and sufficient for maintaining normal REM sleep. Inhibiting or exciting EPSom neurons reduced or increased REM sleep duration, respectively. Activation of the sole downstream target of EPSom neurons, Vglut2 cells in the lateral habenula (LHb), increased sleep via the ventral tegmental area (VTA). A simple chemogenetic scheme to periodically inhibit the LHb over 4 days selectively removed a significant amount of cumulative REM sleep. Chronic REM reduction correlated with mice becoming anxious and more sensitive to aversive stimuli. Therefore, we suggest that REM sleep, in part generated by the EP[-&gt;]LHb[-&gt;]VTA circuit identified here, could contribute to stabilizing reactions to habitual aversive stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Schemas allow us to make assumptions about the world based upon previous experiences and aid in memory organization and retrieval. However, a reliance on schemas may also result in increased rates of false memories. Prior neuroimaging work has linked schematic processing in memory tasks to activity in prefrontal, visual, and temporal regions. Yet, it is unclear what type of processing in these regions underlies memory errors. The current study examines whether similarity between neural patterns associated with schematic lures and that of schematic targets might underlie schematic false memories. Participants studied schematic scenes (e.g., bathroom) in which schema-related lures (e.g., sink) were missing from the scene. Pattern similarity analysis was used to determine whether schema membership or object history drove pattern similarity. The results suggest that in occipital and ventromedial prefrontal cortices, schematic similarity and not object history resulted in more similar neural processing. They also suggest that similarity in object history may not be a critical determinant of assessing novelty if the information is schematically related to targets. Overall, the results add knowledge to our understanding of the qualitative neural relationships underlying conceptual false memories and how schematically related information is viewed in the context of a schema.",

Via a field survey across South America, we discovered and documented patterns of biofluorescence in tropical amphibians. We more than tripled the number of species that have been tested for this trait and added representatives from previously untested anuran families. We found evidence for ecological tuning (i.e., the specific adaptation of a signal to the environment in which it is received) of the novel anuran biofluorescent signals. Across groups, the fluorescence excitation peak matches the wavelengths most available at twilight, the light environment in which most frog species are active. Additionally, biofluorescence emission spans both wavelengths of low availability in twilight and the peak sensitivity of green-sensitive rods in the anuran eye, likely increasing contrast of this signal for a conspecific receiver. With evidence of tuning to the ecology and sensory systems of frogs, our results suggest frog biofluorescence is likely functioning in anuran communication.",

Computational models capable of predicting gene expression directly from DNA sequence can assist in the interpretation of expression-modulating variants, and machine learning models now operate at the large sequence contexts required for capturing long-range human transcriptional regulation. However, existing predictors have focused on bulk transcriptional measurements where gene expression heterogeneity can be drowned out in broadly defined cell types. Here, we use a transfer learning framework, seq2cells, leveraging a pre-trained epigenome model for gene expression prediction from large sequence contexts at single-cell resolution. We show that seq2cells captures cell-specific gene expression beyond the resolution of pseudo-bulked data. Using seq2cells for variant effect prediction reveals heterogeneity within annotated cell types and enables in silico transfer of variant effects between cell populations. We demonstrate the challenges and value of gene expression and variant effect prediction at single-cell resolution, and offer a path to the interpretation of genomic variation at uncompromising resolution and scale.",

    "abstract": "Lipid metabolism is a complex and dynamic system involving numerous enzymes at the junction of multiple metabolic pathways. Disruption of these pathways leads to systematic dyslipidemia, a hallmark of many pathological developments, such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and diabetes. Recent advances in computational tools can provide insights into the dysregulation of lipid biosynthesis, but limitations remain due to the complexity of lipidomic data, limited knowledge of interactions among involved enzymes, and technical challenges in standardizing across different lipid types. In this study, we present a low-parameter, biologically interpretable framework named Lipid Synthesis Investigative Markov model (LipidSIM), which models and predicts the source of perturbations in lipid biosynthesis from lipidomic data. LipidSIM achieves this by accounting for the interdependency between the lipid species via the lipid biosynthesis network and generates testable hypotheses regarding changes in lipid biosynthetic reactions. This feature allows the integration of lipidomics with other omics types, such as transcriptomics, to elucidate the direct driving mechanisms of altered lipidomes due to treatments or disease progression. To demonstrate the value of LipidSIM, we first applied it to hepatic lipidomics following Keap1 knockdown and found changes in mRNA expression of the lipid pathways were consistent with the LipidSIM-predicted fluxes. Second, we used it to study lipidomic changes following intraperitoneal injection of CCl4 to induce fast NAFLD/NASH development and the progression of fibrosis and hepatic cancer. Finally, to show the power of LipidSIM for classifying samples with dyslipidemia, we used a Dgat2-knockdown study dataset. Thus, we show that as it demands no a priori knowledge of enzyme kinetics, LipidSIM is a valuable and intuitive framework for extracting biological insights from complex lipidomic data.",

    "abstract": "The identification of cell-type-specific 3D chromatin interactions between regulatory elements can help to decipher gene regulation and to interpret the function of disease-associated non-coding variants. However, current chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies are unable to resolve interactions at this resolution when only small numbers of cells are available as input. We therefore present ChromaFold, a deep learning model that predicts 3D contact maps and regulatory interactions from single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) data alone. ChromaFold uses pseudobulk chromatin accessibility, co-accessibility profiles across metacells, and predicted CTCF motif tracks as input features and employs a lightweight architecture to enable training on standard GPUs. Once trained on paired scATAC-seq and Hi-C data in human cell lines and tissues, ChromaFold can accurately predict both the 3D contact map and peak-level interactions across diverse human and mouse test cell types. In benchmarking against a recent deep learning method that uses bulk ATAC-seq, DNA sequence, and CTCF ChIP-seq to make cell-type-specific predictions, ChromaFold yields superior prediction performance when including CTCF ChIP-seq data as an input and comparable performance without. Finally, fine-tuning ChromaFold on paired scATAC-seq and Hi-C in a complex tissue enables deconvolution of chromatin interactions across cell subpopulations. ChromaFold thus achieves state-of-the-art prediction of 3D contact maps and regulatory interactions using scATAC-seq alone as input data, enabling accurate inference of cell-type-specific interactions in settings where 3C-based assays are infeasible.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe goal of protein structure refinement is to enhance the precision of predicted protein models, particularly at the residue level of the local structure. Existing refinement approaches primarily rely on physics, whereas molecular simulation methods are resource-intensive and time-consuming. In this study, we employ deep learning methods to extract structural constraints from protein structure residues to assist in protein structure refinement. We introduce a novel method, AnglesRefine, which focuses on a proteins secondary structure and employs a transformer model to refine various protein structure angles (psi, phi, omega, CA_C_N_angle, C_N_CA_angle, N_CA_C_angle), ultimately generating a superior protein model based on the refined angles.\n\nResultsWe evaluate our approach against other cutting-edge protein structure refinement methods using the CASP11-14 and CASP15 datasets. Experimental outcomes indicate that our method generally surpasses other techniques on the CASP11-14 test dataset, while performing comparably or marginally better on the CASP15 test dataset. Our method consistently demonstrates the least likelihood of model quality degradation, e.g., the degradation percentage of our method is less than 10%, while other methods are about 50%. Furthermore, as our approach eliminates the need for conformational search and sampling, it significantly reduces computational time compared to existing protein structure refinement methods.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/Cao-Labs/AnglesRefine.git\n\nContactcaora@plu.edu\n\nCCS CONCEPTS*Computing methodologies [-&gt;] Machine learning.\n\nACM Reference FormatLei Zhang, Junyong Zhu, Sheng Wang, Jie Hou, Dong Si, and Renzhi Cao. 2023.

    "abstract": "Persistent activity of neurons in the prefrontal cortex has been thought to represent the information maintained in working memory, though alternative models have recently challenged this idea. Activity-silent theories posit that stimulus information may be maintained by the activity pattern of neurons that do not produce firing rate significantly elevated about their baseline during the delay period of working memory tasks. We thus tested the ability of neurons that do and do not generate persistent activity in the prefrontal cortex of monkeys to represent spatial and object information in working memory. Neurons that generated persistent activity represented more information about the stimuli in both spatial and object working memory tasks. The amount of information that could be decoded from neural activity depended on the choice of decoder and parameters used but neurons with persistent activity outperformed non-persistent neurons consistently. Although averaged across all neurons and stimuli, firing rate did not appear clearly elevated above baseline during the maintenance of neural activity particularly for object working memory, this grant average masked neurons that generated persistent activity selective for their preferred stimuli, which carried the majority of information about the stimulus identity. These results reveal that prefrontal neurons with generate persistent activity constitute the primary mechanism of working memory maintenance in the cortex.\n\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYCompeting theories suggest that neurons that generate persistent activity or do not are primarily responsible for the maintenance of information, particularly regarding object working memory. While the two models have been debated on theoretical terms, direct comparison of empirical results have been lacking. Analysis of neural activity in a large database of prefrontal recordings revealed that neurons that generate persistent activity were primarily responsible for the maintenance of both spatial and object working memory.",

    "abstract": "How do we gain general insights from limited novel experiences? Humans and animals have a striking ability to learn relationships between experienced items, enabling efficient generalization and rapid assimilation of new information. One fundamental instance of such relational learning is transitive inference (learn A>B and B>C, infer A>C), which can be quickly and globally reorganized upon learning a new item (learn A>B>C and D>E>F, then C>D, and infer B>E). Despite considerable study, neural mechanisms of transitive inference and fast reassembly of existing knowledge remain elusive. Here we adopt a meta-learning (\"learning-to-learn\") approach. We train artificial neural networks, endowed with synaptic plasticity and neuromodulation, to be able to learn novel orderings of arbitrary stimuli from repeated presentation of stimulus pairs. We then obtain a complete mechanistic understanding of this discovered neural learning algorithm. Remarkably, this learning involves active cognition: items from previous trials are selectively reinstated in working memory, enabling delayed, self-generated learning and knowledge reassembly. These findings identify a new mechanism for relational learning and insight, suggest new interpretations of neural activity in cognitive tasks, and highlight a novel approach to discovering neural mechanisms capable of supporting cognitive behaviors.",

    "abstract": "The 8-12 Hz theta rhythm observed in hippocampal local field potentials of animals can be regarded as a \"clock\" that regulates the timing of spikes. While different interneuron sub-types synchronously phase lock to different phases for every theta cycle, the phase of pyramidal neurons spikes asynchronously vary in each theta cycle, depending on the animals position. On the other hand, pyramidal neurons tend to fire slightly faster than the theta oscillation in what is termed hippocampal phase precession. Chimera states are specific solutions to dynamical systems where synchrony and asynchrony coexist, similar to the hippocampal theta oscillation. Here, we test the hypothesis that the hippocampal theta oscillation emerges from chimera dynamics with computational modelling. We utilized multiple network topologies and sizes of Kuramoto oscillator networks that are known to collectively display chimera dynamics. We found that by changing the oscillators intrinsic frequency, the frequency ratio between the synchronized and unsynchronized oscillators can match the frequency ratio between the hippocampal theta oscillation ({approx}8 Hz) and phase precessing pyramidal neurons ({approx}9 Hz). The faster firing population of oscillators also displays theta-sequence-like behaviour and phase precession. Finally, we trained networks of spiking integrate-and-fire neurons to output a chimera state by using the Kuramoto-chimera system as a dynamical supervisor. We found that the firing times of subsets of individual neurons display phase precession. These results imply that the hippocampal theta oscillation may be a chimera state, further suggesting the importance of chimera states in neuroscience.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is able to re-structure chromatin organization and alters the epigenomic landscape of the host genome, though the mechanisms that produce such changes are still poorly understood. Here, we investigate with polymer physics chromatin re-organization of the host genome, in space and time upon SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. We show that re-structuring of A/B compartments is well explained by a re-modulation of intra-compartment homotypic affinities, which leads to the weakening of A-A interactions and enhances A-B mixing. At TAD level, re-arrangements are physically described by a general reduction of the loop extrusion activity coupled with an alteration of chromatin phase-separation properties, resulting in more intermingling between different TADs and spread in space of TADs themselves. In addition, the architecture of loci relevant to the antiviral interferon (IFN) response, such as DDX58 or IFIT, results more variable within the 3D single-molecule population of the infected model, suggesting that viral infection leads to a loss of chromatin structural specificity. Analysis of time trajectories of pairwise gene-enhancer and higher-order contacts reveals that such variability derives from a more fluctuating dynamics in infected case, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 alters gene regulation by impacting the stability of the contact network in time.\n\nOverall, our study provides the first polymer-physics based 4D reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 infected genome with mechanistic insights on the consequent gene mis-regulation.",

    "abstract": "The motifs involved in tropism and immunological interactions of SARS-CoV spike (S) protein were investigated utilizing the Qubevirus platform. We showed that separately, 14 overlapping peptide fragments representing the S protein (F1-14 of 100 residues each) could be inserted into the C-terminus of A1 on recombinant Qubevirus without affecting its viability. Additionally, recombinant phage expression resulted in the surface exposure of different engineered fragments in an accessible manner. The F6 from S425-525, was found to contain the binding determinant of the recombinant human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (rhACE2), with the shortest active binding motif situated between residues S437-492. Upstream, another fragment, F7, containing an overlapping portion of F6 would not bind to rhACE2, confirming not just only that residues were linear but equally also the appropriate structural orientation of F6 upon the Qubevirus. The F6 (S441-460) and other inserts, including F7/F8 (S601-620) and F10 (S781-800), were demonstrated to contain important immunological determinants through recognition and binding of S protein specific (anti-S) antibodies. An engineered chimeric insert bearing the fusion of all three anti-S reactive epitopes, improved substantially the recognition and binding to their cognate antibodies. These results provide insights into humoral immune relevant epitopes and tropism characteristics of the S protein with implications for the development of subunit vaccines or other biologics against SARS-CoV.\n\nSignificanceMapping epitopes within the receptor binding domains of viruses which are essential for viral tropism is critical for developing antiviral agents and subunit vaccines. In this study we have engineered the surface of Qubevirus to display a peptide library derived from the SARS-CoV S protein. In biopanning with S protein antibodies, we have identified three peptide fragments (EP1, EP2 and EP3) which reacted selectively with antibodies specific to the S protein. We demonstrated that all recombinant phage displayed peptide fragments both individually and as chimera exposed important immunological epitopes to their cognate antibodies. A peptide fragment F6 situated at S425-525, was found containing the binding determinant of the recombinant human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (rhACE2), with the shortest active binding motif situated between residues S437-492.

    "abstract": "The lack of available treatments for many antimicrobial resistant infections highlights the critical need for antibiotic discovery innovation. Peptides are an underappreciated antibiotic scaffold because they often suffer from proteolytic instability and toxicity towards human cells, making in vivo use challenging. To investigate sequence factors related to serum activity, we adapt an antibacterial display technology to screen a library of peptide macrocycles for antibacterial potential directly in human serum. We identify dozens of new macrocyclic peptide antibiotic sequences and find that serum activity within our library is influenced by peptide length, cationic charge, and the number of disulfide bonds present. Interestingly, an optimized version of our most active lead peptide permeates the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria without strong inner membrane disruption and kills bacteria slowly while causing cell elongation. This contrasts with traditional cationic antimicrobial peptides, which kill rapidly via lysis of both bacterial membranes. Notably, this optimized variant is not toxic to mammalian cells and retains its function in vivo, suggesting therapeutic promise. Our results support the use of more physiologically relevant conditions when screening peptides for antimicrobial activity which retain in vivo functionality.\n\nSignificanceTraditional methods of natural antibiotic discovery are low throughput and cannot keep pace with the development of antimicrobial resistance. Synthetic peptide display technologies offer a high-throughput means of screening drug candidates, but rarely consider functionality beyond simple target binding and do not consider retention of function in vivo. Here, we adapt a function-based, antibacterial display technology to screen a large library of peptide macrocycles directly for bacterial growth inhibition in human serum. This screen identifies an optimized non-toxic macrocyclic peptide antibiotic retaining in vivo function, suggesting this advancement could increase clinical antibiotic discovery efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Sickle cell trait (HbAS) confers protection against severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria but has little effect on infection rates per se. The reason for this is not fully understood. However, it appears to involve impaired parasite survival at the low oxygen tensions prevailing in the postcapillary venules where P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IEs) often accumulate. This IE sequestration is mediated by parasite-encoded IE surface ligands, primarily PfEMP1. Different variants of this family of proteins bind to host receptors with different tissue distributions. We hypothesized that P. falciparum parasites modulate PfEMP1 expression to enhance their survival by altering IE tissue distribution in HbAS hosts. To test this, we studied PfEMP1 expression in parasites maintained in vitro in HbAS and HbAA erythrocytes. We found that parasite survival and PfEMP1 expression were reduced in HbAS IEs, particularly at low oxygen tensions, without obvious qualitative differences in PfEMP1 expression between HbAA and HbAS IEs. In contrast, parasites growing in HbAS erythrocytes increased their transcription of pfsa2, a parasite gene hypothesized to be under HbS-dependent selection. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis of quantitative but not qualitative modulation of PfEMP1 expression as a parasite strategy for coping with HbAS-related host resistance. Moreover, it provides a hint at the role of Pfsa2 in parasite adaptation to HbAS and highlights the importance of further research.",

    "abstract": "Most bacterial cell envelopes contain a cell wall layer made of peptidoglycan. The synthesis of new peptidoglycan is critical for cell growth, division and morphogenesis, and is also coordinated with peptidoglycan hydrolysis to accommodate the new material. However, the enzymes that cleave peptidoglycan must be carefully controlled to avoid autolysis. In recent years, some control mechanisms have begun to emerge, although there are many more questions than answers for how most cell wall hydrolases are regulated. Here, we report a novel cell wall hydrolase control mechanism in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which we discovered during our characterization of a mutant sensitive to the overproduction of a secretin protein. The mutation affected an uncharacterized Sel1-like repeat protein encoded by the PA3978 locus. In addition to the secretin-sensitivity phenotype, PA3978 disruption also increased resistance to a {beta}-lactam antibiotic used in the clinic. In vivo and in vitro analysis revealed that PA3978 binds to the catalytic domain of the lytic transglycosylase MltF and inhibits its activity. {Delta}PA3978 mutant phenotypes were suppressed by deleting mltF, consistent with them having been caused by elevated MltF activity. We also discovered another interaction partner of PA3978 encoded by the PA5502 locus. The phenotypes of a {Delta}PA5502 mutant suggested that PA5502 interferes with the inhibitory function of PA3978 towards MltF, and we confirmed that activity for PA5502 in vitro. Therefore, PA3978 and PA5502 form an inhibitor/anti-inhibitor system that controls MltF activity. We propose to name these proteins Ilt (inhibitor of lytic transglycosylase) and Lii (lytic transglycosylase inhibitor, inhibitor).\n\nIMPORTANCEA peptidoglycan cell wall is an essential component of almost all bacterial cell envelopes, which determines cell shape and prevents osmotic rupture. Antibiotics that interfere with peptidoglycan synthesis have been one of the most important treatments for bacterial infections. Peptidoglycan must also be hydrolyzed to incorporate new material for cell growth and division, and to help accommodate important envelope-spanning systems. However, the enzymes that hydrolyze peptidoglycan must be carefully controlled to prevent autolysis. Exactly how this control is achieved is poorly understood in most cases, but is a highly active area of current research. Identifying hydrolase control mechanisms has the potential to provide new targets for therapeutic intervention. The work here reports the important discovery of a novel inhibitor/anti-nhibitor system that controls the activity of a cell wall hydrolase in the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and which also affects resistance to an antibiotic used in the clinic.",

    "abstract": "Butyrate, produced by gut microbe during dietary fiber fermentation, plays anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in chronic inflammation diseases, yet it remains to be explored whether butyrate has protective effects against viral infections. Here, we demonstrated that butyrate alleviated tissue injury in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected golden hamsters with supplementation of butyrate before and during the infection. Butyrate-treated hamsters showed augmentation of type I interferon (IFN) response and activation of endothelial cells without exaggerated inflammation. In addition, butyrate regulated redox homeostasis by enhancing the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) to inhibit excessive apoptotic cell death. Therefore, butyrate exhibited an effective prevention against SARS-CoV-2 by upregulating antiviral immune responses and promoting cell survival.\n\nIMPORTANCESince SARS-CoV-2 has caused severe disease characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in humans, it is essential to develop therapeutics based on relieving such severe clinical symptoms. Current therapy strategies mainly focus on individuals who have COVID-19, however, there is still a strong need for prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

    "abstract": "Even though Bacillus subtilis is one of the most studied organisms, no function has been identified for about 20% of its proteins. Among these unknown proteins are several RNA- and ribosome-binding proteins suggesting that they exert functions in cellular information processing. In this work, we have investigated the RNA-binding protein YlxR. This protein is widely conserved in bacteria and strongly constitutively expressed in B. subtilis suggesting an important function. We have identified the RNA subunit of the essential RNase P as the binding partner of YlxR. The main activity of RNase P is the processing of 5 ends of pre-tRNAs. In vitro processing assays demonstrated that the presence of YlxR results in reduced RNase P activity. Chemical cross-linking studies followed by in silico docking analysis and experiments with site-directed mutant proteins suggest that YlxR binds to the region of the RNase P RNA that is important for binding and cleavage of the pre-tRNA substrate. We conclude that the YlxR protein is a novel interaction partner of the RNA subunit of RNase P that serves to finetune RNase P activity to ensure appropriate amounts of mature tRNAs for translation. We rename the YlxR protein RnpM for RNase P modulator.",

    "abstract": "Cyclic lipopeptides are key bioactive secondary metabolites produced by some plant beneficial rhizobacteria such as Pseudomonas and Bacillus. They exhibit antimicrobial properties, promote induced systemic resistance in plants and support key developmental traits including motility, biofilm formation and root colonization. However, our knowledge about the fate of lipopeptides once released in the environment and especially upon contact with neighboring rhizobacteria remains limited. Here, we investigated the enzymatic degradation of Bacillus and Pseudomonas cyclic lipopeptides by Streptomyces venezuelae. We observed that Streptomyces is able to degrade the three lipopeptides surfactin, iturin and fengycin upon confrontation with of B. velezensis in vitro and in planta according to specific mechanisms. S. venezuelae was also able to degrade the structurally diverse sessilin, tolaasin, orfamide, xantholisin and putisolvin-type lipopeptides produced by Pseudomonas, indicating that this trait is likely engage in the interaction with various competitors.Furthermore, the degradation of CLPs is associated with the release of free amino and fatty acids and was found to enhance Streptomyces growth, indicating a possible nutritional utilization. Thereby, this work stresses on how the enzymatic arsenal of S. venezuelae may contribute to its adaptation to BSMs-driven interactions with microbial competitors. The ability of Streptomyces to degrade exogenous lipopeptides and feed on them adds a new facet to the implications of the degradation of those compounds by Streptomyces, where linearization of surfactin was previously reported as a detoxification mechanism. Additionally, we hypothesize that lipopeptide-producing rhizobacteria and their biocontrol potential are impacted by the degradation of their lipopeptides as observed with the polarized motility of B. velezensis, avoiding the confrontation zone with Streptomyces and the loss of antifungal properties of degraded iturin. This work illustrates how CLPs, once released in the environment, may rapidly be remodeled or degraded by members of the bacterial community, with potential impacts on CLP-producing rhizobacteria and the biocontrol products derived from them.",

    "abstract": "The pressing need for clinical diagnostics has required the development of novel nucleic acid-based detection technologies that are sensitive, fast, and inexpensive, and that can be deployed at point-of-care. Recently, the RNA-guided ribonuclease CRISPR-Cas13 has been successfully harnessed for such purposes. However, developing assays for detection of genetic variability, for example single-nucleotide polymorphisms, is still challenging and previously described design strategies are not always generalizable. Here, we expanded our characterization of LbuCas13a RNA-detection specificity by performing a combination of experimental RNA mismatch tolerance profiling, molecular dynamics simulations, protein, and crRNA engineering. We found certain positions in the crRNA-target-RNA duplex that are particularly sensitive to mismatches and establish the effect of RNA concentration in mismatch tolerance. Additionally, we determined that shortening the crRNA spacer or modifying the direct repeat of the crRNA leads to stricter specificities. Furthermore, we harnessed our understanding of LbuCas13a allosteric activation pathways through molecular dynamics and structure-guided engineering to develop novel Cas13a variants that display increased sensitivities to single-nucleotide mismatches. We deployed these Cas13a variants and crRNA design strategies to achieve superior discrimination of SARS-CoV-2 strains compared to wild-type LbuCas13a.

Model systems to study the role of mitochondrial gene expression in bronchial epithelium are lacking. Here, we create custom bronchial epithelial cell lines derived from primary airway epithelium that are depleted of mitochondrial DNA.\n\nMethodsWe treated BET-1A and BEAS-2B cells with ethidium bromide (EtBr) with or without 2,3-dideoxycytidine (ddC) to create cells lacking mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Cells mtDNA copy number were verified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in comparison to nuclear DNA (nDNA). Cells were also assessed for oxidative phosphorylation by measures of oxygen consumption using the Seahorse analyzer.\n\nResultsOne week of EtBr treatment led to [~]95% reduction of mtDNA copy number (mtDNA-CN) in cells (mtDNA-CN, mean{+/-}SE, baseline vs. treatment: BEAS-2B, 820 {+/-} 62 vs. 56 {+/-} 9; BET-1A, 957 {+/-} 52 vs. 73 {+/-} 2), which was further reduced by addition of 25 M ddC (mtDNA-CN: BEAS-2B, 2.8; BET-1A, 47.9). Treatment for up to three weeks with EtBr and ddC led to near complete loss of mtDNA (mtDNA-CN: BEAS-2B, 0.1; BET-1A, 0.3). The basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of mtDNA-depleted BET-1A and BEAS-2B cells dropped to near zero. Glycolysis measured by extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) increased [~]two-fold in cells when mtDNA was eliminated [ECAR (mpH/min/103 cells), baseline vs. treatment: BEAS-2B, 0.50 {+/-} 0.03 vs. 0.94 {+/-} 0.10 P=0.005; BET-1A, 0.80 {+/-} 0.04 vs. 1.14 {+/-} 0.06 P=0.001].\n\nConclusionMitochondrial DNA-depleted BET-1A {rho}0 and BEAS-2B {rho}0 cell lines are viable, lack the capacity for aerobic respiration, and increase glycolysis.

    "abstract": "In cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), purified macromolecules are typically applied to a grid bearing a holey carbon foil, blotted to remove excess liquid and rapidly frozen in a roughly 20-100 nm thick layer of vitreous ice that is suspended across roughly 1 m-wide foil holes. The resulting sample is then imaged using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and, after substantial image processing, near-atomic resolution structures can be determined. Despite cryo-EMs widespread adoption, sample preparation remains a severe bottleneck in cryo-EM workflows, with users often encountering challenges related to samples behaving poorly in the suspended vitreous ice. Recently, methods have been developed to modify cryo-EM grids with a single continuous layer of graphene, which acts as a support surface that often increases particle density in the imaged area and can reduce interactions between particles and the air-water interface. Here, we provide detailed protocols for the application of graphene to cryo-EM grids, and for rapidly assessing the relative hydrophilicity of the resulting grids. Additionally, we describe an EM-based method to confirm the presence of graphene by visualizing its characteristic diffraction pattern. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of these graphene supports by rapidly reconstructing a 2.7 [A] resolution density map of an exemplar Cas9 complex using a highly pure sample at a relatively low concentration.\n\nSUMMARYThe application of support layers, such as graphene, to cryo-electron microscopy grids can increase the density of particles imaged, limit particle interactions with the air-water interface, reduce the extent of beam-induced motion, and, in some instances, improve the distribution of particle orientations. This paper describes a robust protocol for coating cryo-EM grids with a monolayer of graphene for improved cryo-sample preparation.",

Furthermore, survivors of pneumonia from any cause have an elevated risk of dementia1-4. Dysfunction in microglia, the primary immune cell in the brain, has been linked to cognitive impairment in murine models of dementia and in humans5. Here, we report a transcriptional response in human microglia collected from patients who died following COVID-19 suggestive of their activation by TNF-[a] and other circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. Consistent with these findings, the levels of 55 alveolar and plasma cytokines were elevated in a cohort of 341 patients with respiratory failure, including 93 unvaccinated patients with COVID-19 and 203 patients with other causes of pneumonia. While peak levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were similar in patients with pneumonia irrespective of etiology, cumulative cytokine exposure was higher in patients with COVID-19. Corticosteroid treatment, which has been shown to be beneficial in patients with COVID-196, was associated with lower levels of CXCL10, CCL8, and CCL2--molecules that sustain inflammatory circuits between alveolar macrophages harboring SARS-CoV-2 and activated T cells7.

    "abstract": "In recent times, pathogen genome sequencing has become increasingly used to investigate infectious disease outbreaks. When genomic data is sampled densely enough amongst infected individuals, it can help resolve who infected whom. However, transmission analysis cannot rely solely on a phylogeny of the genomes but must account for the within-host evolution of the pathogen, which blurs the relationship between phylogenetic and transmission trees. When only a single genome is sampled for each host, the uncertainty about who infected whom can be quite high. Consequently, transmission analysis based on multiple genomes of the same pathogen per host has a clear potential for delivering more precise results, even though it is more laborious to achieve. Here we present a new methodology that can use any number of genomes sampled from a set of individuals to reconstruct their transmission network. We use simulated data to show that our method becomes more accurate as more genomes per host are provided, and that it can infer key infectious disease parameters such as the size of the transmission bottleneck, within-host growth rate, basic reproduction number and sampling fraction. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method in applications to real datasets from an outbreak of Pseudomonas aeruginosa amongst cystic fibrosis patients and a nosocomial outbreak of Klebsiella pneumoniae.",

    "abstract": "Increased levels of Fetal Hemoglobin reduce the severity of symptoms of patients with sickle cell disease and decrease the risk of death. An affordable, small molecule drug that stimulates HbF expression in vivo would be ideally suited to treat the large numbers of SCD patients that exist worldwide. Our previous work showed that administration of the LSD1 (KDM1A) inhibitor RN-1 to normal baboons increased Fetal Hemoglobin (HbF) and was tolerated over a prolonged treatment period. HbF elevations were associated with changes in epigenetic modifications that included increased levels of H3K4 di-and tri-methyl lysine at the {gamma}-globin promoter. While dramatic effects of the loss of LSD1 on hematopoietic differentiation have been observed in murine LSD1 gene deletion and silencing models, the effect of pharmacological inhibition of LSD1 in vivo on hematopoietic differentiation is unknown. The goal of these experiments was to investigate the in vivo mechanism of action of the LSD1 inhibitor RN-1 by determining its effect on {gamma}-globin expression in highly purified subpopulations of bone marrow erythroid cells enriched for varying stages of erythroid differentiation isolated directly from baboons treated with RN-1 and also by investigating the effect of RN1 on the global transcriptome in a highly purified population of proerythroblasts. Our results show that RN-1 administered to baboons targets an early event during erythroid differentiation responsible for {gamma}-globin repression and increases the expression of a limited number of genes including genes involved in erythroid differentiation such as GATA2, GFi-1B, and LYN.",

    "abstract": "Co-expression networks have recently emerged as a useful approach for updating and improving gene annotation at a near-genome level. This is based on the hypothesis that function can be inferred by delineating transcriptional networks in which a gene of interest is embedded. In this study, we generated a co-expression network for the filamentous cell factory Aspergillus niger from 128 RNA-seq experiments. We confirm that over 70% of the >14,000 A. niger genes are represented in this network and show that gene functions can be accurately predicted as evidenced by analysis of various control sub-networks. Our analyses further indicate that this RNA-seq co-expression network has a higher predictive power compared to the microarray co-expression network that we published in 2019. To demonstrate the potential of the new co-expression network to unveil complex and non-intuitive predictions for gene regulation phenomena, we provide here new insights into the temporal, spatial and metabolic expression profile that connects a secreted antifungal peptide with mycelial growth, asexual development, secondary metabolism and pectin degradation in A. niger. To empower biologists to generate or apply co-expression networks in the fungal kingdom and beyond, we also demonstrate that (i) high quality networks can be generated from only 32 transcriptional experiments; (ii) such low numbers of experiments can be safely compensated for by using higher thresholds for defining co-expression pairs; and (iii) a  safety in numbers rule applies, whereby experimental conditions have limited impacts on network content provided a certain number of experiments are included.",

    "abstract": "Protein glycosylation is one of the most common PTMs and many cell surface receptors, extracellular proteins and biopharmaceuticals are glycosylated. However, HDX-MS analysis of such important glycoproteins has so far been limited by difficulties in determining the HDX of the protein segments that contain glycans. We have developed a column containing immobilized PNGase Rc (from Rudaea cellulosilytica) that can readily be implemented into a conventional HDX-MS setup to allow improved analysis of glycoproteins. We show that HDX-MS with the PNGase Rc column enables efficient online removal of N-linked glycans and the determination of the HDX of glycosylated regions in several complex glycoproteins. Additionally, we use the PNGase Rc column to perform a comprehensive HDX-MS mapping of the binding epitope of a mAb to c-Met, a complex glycoprotein drug target. Importantly, the column retains high activity in the presence of common quench-buffer additives like TCEP and urea and performed consistent across 114 days of extensive use. Overall, our work shows that HDX-MS with the integrated PNGase Rc column can enable fast and efficient online deglycosylation at harsh quench conditions to provide comprehensive analysis of complex glycoproteins.",

Those with direct antibacterial activity often kill via cell membrane lysis, but have difficulty distinguishing between target cells and mammalian cells complicating therapeutic use. Here, we use a new technique called deep mutational surface localized antimicrobial display (dmSLAY) to rapidly elucidate single residue importance and flexibility for Protegrin-1, a potent yet toxic host-defense peptide. Subsequent biochemical analyses reveal that bacterial membrane selectivity is improved for Protegrin-1 variants which maintain membrane bound secondary structure, avoid large aromatic residues, and mutate cysteine pairs. Machine learning is used to expand our analysis to encompass over five million sequence variations and uncover full mutational profiles which promote antibacterial potency, toxicity, and specificity for bacterial or mammalian cell membranes.

    "abstract": "To improve understanding of the role of site-specific proline hydroxylation in controlling protein function, we have developed a robust workflow for the identification of proline hydroxylation sites in proteins using a combination of hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) enrichment and high-resolution nano-Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS). Using this approach, together with refining and filtering parameters during data analysis, by combining the results from cell lines being treated with either the prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor Roxadustat (FG-4592, FG) or the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (MG), or DMSO, a total of 4,993 and 3,247 proline hydroxylation sites were identified in HEK293 and RCC4 samples, respectively. A subset of 1,954 and 1,253 high confident proline hydroxylation sites (non-collagen) from HEK293 and RCC4 samples were inhibited by FG-4592 treatment. A set of features characteristic of proline hydroxylated peptides were identified in both datasets, which differ from either unmodified peptides, or oxidised peptides. Peptides containing hydroxyproline were enriched in the more hydrophilic HILIC fractions and showed characteristic differences in charge and mass distribution, as compared with unmodified or oxidised peptides. Furthermore, we discovered that the intensity of the diagnostic hydroxyproline immonium ion was greatly influenced by parameters including the MS collision energy setting, parent peptide concentration and the sequence of adjacent amino acids neighbouring the modified proline. We show using synthetic peptides that a combination of retention time in LC and optimised MS parameter settings allows reliable identification of proline hydroxylation sites in peptides, even when multiple prolines residues are present. By matching all the proline hydroxylated, non-collagen proteins to the Pfam database, the most common protein family domains identified in both HEK293 and RCC4 datasets were RNA recognition motif (RRM_1), WD40 repeat (WD40), and protein kinase domain (Pkinase). Sequence analysis of the hydroxylated peptides showed enrichment for the motif GxPGxx, including the Gxx repeats found in collagen proteins, as well as the protein kinase domain GTP motif. Glycine (G), serine (S) and glutamic acid (E) residues were found frequently in the sequence window from the hydroxylated peptides. Reactome pathway analysis for the proteins of these newly identified proline hydroxylation sites (FG inhibited), showed enrichment for proteins involved in metabolism of RNA, mRNA splicing and cell cycle regulation, potentially mediated by prolyl hydroxylase enzymes (PHDs).",

In this study, we identified three novel glycoside hydrolase families distributed among all three domains of life and characterized eight novel {beta}-N-acetylgalactosaminidases and {beta}-N-acetylhexosaminidase through sequence-based screening of deep-sea metagenomes and subsequent searching of public protein databases. Despite low sequence similarity, the crystal structures of these enzymes demonstrate that all enzymes share a prototype structure and diversify their substrate specificities (endo-, dual-endo/exo-, and exo-) through the accumulation of mutations and insertional amino acid sequences. The diverse {beta}-N-acetylgalactosaminidases reported in this study could facilitate the comprehension of their structures and functions and present novel evolutionary pathways for expanding their substrate specificity.",

    "abstract": "Urine provides a diverse source of information related to a patients health status and is ideal for clinical proteomics because of its ease of collection. To date, there is no standard operating procedure for reproducible and robust urine sample preparation for mass spectrometry-based clinical proteomics. To this end, a novel workflow was developed based on an on-bead protein capture, clean up, and digestion without the requirement for processing steps such as precipitation or centrifugation. The workflow was applied to an acute kidney injury (AKI) pilot study. Urine from clinical samples and a pooled sample were subjected to automated sample preparation in a KingFisher Flex magnetic handling station using a novel urine-HILIC (uHLC) approach based on MagReSyn(R) HILIC microspheres. For benchmarking, the pooled sample was also prepared using a published protocol based on an on-membrane (OM) protein capture and digestion workflow. Peptides were analysed by LCMS in data independent acquisition (DIA) mode using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 UPLC coupled to a Sciex 5600 mass spectrometer. Data was searched in Spectronaut 17. Both workflows showed similar peptide and protein identifications in the pooled sample. The uHLC workflow was easier to set up and complete, having less hands-on time than the OM method, with fewer manual processing steps. Lower peptide and protein CV was observed in the uHLC technical replicates. Following statistical analysis, candidate protein markers were filtered, at [&ge;] 2-fold change in abundance, [&ge;] 2 unique peptides and [&le;] 1% false discovery rate, and revealed many significant, differentially abundant kidney injury-associated urinary proteins. The pilot data derived using this novel workflow provides information on the urinary proteome of patients with AKI. Further exploration in a larger cohort using this novel high-throughput method is warranted.",

    "abstract": "TNT-based buried landmines are explosive devices consisting of mainly 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (2,4,6-TNT), but also a 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT) impurity. It is reported that some 2,4-DNT impurity vapors slowly leak through land mine covers and into the soil above them, making this compound a potential indicator for the presence of buried landmines. There are several approaches to identify the presence of chemicals in the environment, one of which is based on a microbial detection system. This approach was previously used to address the challenge of remotely identifying buried landmines by applying genetically engineered microbial whole cell biosensors capable of sensing trace signatures of the explosive compound 2,4,6-TNT and its degradation product, 2,4-DNT. Upon exposure to 2,4-DNT, the genetically engineered bacterial reporter strains, containing a genetic fusion between a sensing element for 2,4-DNT (yqjF gene promoter) and a fluorescence/ bioluminescence reporting element (GFP/ luxCDABE genes), generate a measurable dose-dependent signal within the whole cell biosensor system. This biological component of a comprehensive remote sensing solution was significantly improved after several rounds of random mutagenesis to the yqjF promoter region using a prone-to-error PCR and selection of the best mutants. In the present project further significant improvements were obtained in signal intensity, response time, and in the limit of detection, following an additional round of random mutagenesis. Two new mutants, named A10 and C5, were identified. The new mutants present high induction levels both in terms of Ratio (sample/control) and delta (sample-control), making these strains more amenable to remote detection. To isolate a more sensitive mutant, the 3rd round of random mutagenesis library (about 1000 strains) was re-exposed to lower concentration of 2,4-DNT, but no better candidate was isolated. Possible alternative approaches to lower the detection threshold of the system, such as the use of permeability mutants, are now being tested.",

    "abstract": "Tissue engineering strategies predominantly rely on the production of living substitutes, whereby implanted cells actively participate in the regenerative process. Beyond cost and delayed graft availability, the patient-specific performance of engineered tissues poses serious concerns on their clinical translation ability. A more exciting paradigm consist in exploiting cell-laid, engineered extracellular matrices (eECM), which can be used as off-the-shelf materials. Here, the regenerative capacity solely relies on the preservation of the eECM structure and embedded signals to instruct an endogenous repair. We recently described the possibility to exploit custom human stem cell lines for eECM manufacturing. In addition to the conferred standardization, the availability of such cell lines opened avenues for the design of tailored eECMs by applying dedicated genetic tools. In this study, we aim at demonstrating the possibility of exploiting CRISPR/Cas9 as a high precision system for editing the composition and function of eECMs. To this end, human mesenchymal stromal/stem cell (hMSC) lines were modified to knockout VEGF and RUNX2 and assessed for their capacity to generate osteoinductive cartilage matrices. We report the successful editing of hMSCs, subsequently leading to targeted VEGF and RUNX2-knockout cartilage eECMs. Despite the absence of VEGF, eECMs retained full capacity to instruct ectopic endochondral ossification. Conversely, RUNX2-edited eECMs exhibited impaired hypertrophy which resulted in delayed bone formation in vivo. In summary, our approach can be harnessed to identify the necessary eECM factors driving endogenous repair. Our work paves the road towards the compositional eECMs editing and their exploitation in broad regenerative contexts.",

    "abstract": "KCNMA1-linked channelopathy is a neurological disorder produced by malfunctioning of the BK channel, characterized by seizure, motor abnormalities, and neurodevelopmental disability. Twenty-one KCNMA1 patient-associated variants have been classified as gain-of-function (GOF) or loss-of-function (LOF) in BK channel activity, and the remaining [~]40% are variants of uncertain significance (VUS). To address the physical relationships, this study analyzed KCNMA1 missense variants within the context of BK channel cryoEM structures. Clusters of LOF variants were identified in the pore, within the AC region (RCK1), and near the Ca2+ bowl (RCK2), overlapping with sites of pharmacological or endogenous modulation. However, no clustering relationship was found for GOF variants. Next, variants were analyzed with widely used pathogenicity algorithms. The individual performances of REVEL, Mutpred, MetaLR, and CADD/PHRED were compared for each variant, incorporating them into a weighted summation model (WSM). The WSM component was integrated with BK channel structural parameters in a modular algorithm to generate a  KCNMA1 meta score (KMS). KMS performance showed a 7% difference from the highest performing individual algorithm (REVEL). Several functionally uncharacterized variants that showed different predictions between KMS and REVEL were assessed further using electrophysiological recordings of BK currents. Two KMS+; REVEL- variants were confirmed pathogenic (M578T and D965V), and one KMS-; REVEL+ variant was confirmed non-pathogenic (D800Y). However, KMS failed to accurately categorize two variants (E656A and K457E). Thus, although incorporation of structural data within the KMS algorithm results in a small performance improvement, its predictive capabilities will be increased as more disease-delineated variants are functionally tested, new structural components are available, and novel functional modules are developed.",

Protein translocation triggers intracellular signaling, and techniques such as chemically induced dimerization (CID) have been used to manipulate signaling pathways by altering the subcellular localization of signaling molecules.

We here applied our recently developed self-localizing ligand-induced protein translocation (SLIPT) system to S. pombe and successfully perturbed several cell cycle-related proteins. The SLIPT system utilizes self-localizing ligands to recruit binding partners to specific subcellular compartments, such as the plasma membrane or nucleus. We optimzed the self-localizing ligands to maintain long-term recruitment of target molecules to the plasma membrane. By knocking in genes encoding the binding partners for self-localizing ligands, we observed changes in the localization of several endogenous molecules and found perturbations in the cell cycle and associated phenotypes. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of the SLIPT system as a chemogenetic tool for rapid perturbation of endogenous molecules in S. pombe, providing a valuable approach for studying intracellular signaling and cell cycle regulation with improved temporal resolution.",

    "abstract": "Gain-of-function mutations in the dsDNA sensing adaptor STING lead to a severe autoinflammatory syndrome known as STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in Infancy (SAVI). SAVI patients develop interstitial lung disease (ILD) and commonly produce anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs), indicative of concomitant autoimmunity. Mice heterozygous for the most common SAVI mutation, V154M (VM), also develop ILD, triggered by nonhematopoietic VM cells, but exhibit severe peripheral lymphopenia, low serum Ig titers and fail to produce autoantibodies. In contrast, we now show that lethally irradiated VM mice reconstituted with WT stem cells (WT[-&gt;]VM chimeras) develop ANAs and lung-reactive autoantibodies associated with accumulation of activated lymphocytes and formation of germinal centers in lung tissues. Moreover, when splenocytes from WT[-&gt;]VM chimeras were adoptively transferred into unmanipulated Rag1-/- mice, donor T cells accumulated in the lung. Overall, these findings demonstrate that expression of the VM mutation in non-hematopoietic cells can promote the activation of immunocompetent autoreactive lymphocytes.\n\nSummaryChimeric mice expressing STING only in non-hematopoietic cells develop systemic and lung directed autoimmunity which recapitulates what is seen in pediatric patients with SAVI disease.",

    "abstract": "We sought to explore the hypothesis that host factors required for HIV-1 replication also play a role in latency reversal. Using a CRISPR gene library of putative HIV dependency factors, we performed a screen to identify genes required for latency reactivation. We identified several HIV-1 dependency factors that play a key role in HIV-1 latency reactivation including ELL, UBE2M, TBL1XR1, HDAC3, AMBRA1, and ALYREF. Knockout of Cyclin T1 (CCNT1), a component of the P-TEFb complex important for transcription elongation, was the top hit in the screen and had the largest effect on HIV latency reversal with a wide variety of latency reversal agents. Moreover, CCNT1 knockout prevents latency reactivation in a primary CD4+ T cell model of HIV latency without affecting activation of these cells. RNA sequencing data showed that CCNT1 regulates HIV-1 proviral genes to a larger extent than any other host gene and had no significant effects on RNA transcripts in primary T cells after activation. We conclude that CCNT1 function is redundant in T cells but is absolutely required for HIV latency reversal.",
