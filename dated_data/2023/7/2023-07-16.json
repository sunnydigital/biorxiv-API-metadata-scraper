    "abstract": "Studies of trait-mapping and local adaptation often identify signatures of genetically repeated evolution, where different species independently evolve similar phenotypes using the same genes. Such patterns appear incongruent with current estimations of quantitative trait architecture: with hundreds or thousands or genes contributing to a trait, why would selection make repeated use of the same genes? This incongruence is particularly puzzling in light of the Fisher-Orr model, which predicts that repeated use of the same gene should decrease with increasing trait dimensionality, as alleles of large-effect are unlikely to be beneficial when there is high pleiotropy. When adaptation occurs for a single trait in spatially heterogeneous environments with migration, large-effect alleles are more strongly favoured, but it is unclear whether this result would generalize to multiple traits, especially if there are trade-offs between them. Here, we explore this question using individual-based simulations of a two-patch model with multiple quantitative traits governed by mutations with pleiotropic effects. We first confirm that repeatability is lower in spatially homogeneous environments, and then explore the effect of trait dimensionality and pleiotropy in a spatially heterogeneous environment. While repeatability decreases with increasing trait dimensionality, trade-offs in mutation effects on traits do not strongly limit the contribution of a locus of large effect to repeated adaptation, particularly under increased migration. These results suggest that evolutionary convergence will be more pronounced for local rather than global adaptation. Whereas pleiotropy limits repeatability in a single-population model, when there is local adaptation with gene flow, repeatability can be increased if some loci are able to produce alleles of large effect, even with pleiotropic trade-offs.",

    "abstract": "Flash-induced absorption changes in the Soret region arising from the [PD1PD2]+ state, the chlorophyll cation radical formed upon light excitation of Photosystem II (PSII), were measured in Mn-depleted PSII cores at pH 8.6. Under these conditions, TyrD is i) reduced before the first flash, and ii) oxidized before subsequent flashes. In wild-type PSII, when TyrD[bullet] is present, an additional signal in the [PD1PD2]+-minus-[PD1PD2] difference spectrum was observed when compared to the first flash when TyrD is not oxidized. The additional feature was \"W-shaped\" with troughs at 434 nm and 446 nm. This feature was absent when TyrD was reduced, but was present i) when TyrD was physically absent (and replaced by phenylalanine) or ii) when its H-bonding histidine (D2-His189) was physically absent (replaced by a Leucine). Thus, the simple difference spectrum without the double trough feature at 434 nm and 446 nm, seemed to require the native structural environment around the reduced TyrD and its H bonding partners to be present. We found no evidence of involvement of PD1, ChlD1, PheD1, PheD2, TyrZ, and the Cytb559 heme in the W-shaped difference spectrum. However, the use of a mutant of the PD2 axial His ligand, the D2-His197Ala, shows that the PD2 environment seems involved in the formation of \"W-shaped\" signal.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how fish growth and reproduction will adapt to changing environmental conditions is a fundamental question in evolutionary ecology, but predicting the responses of specific taxa is challenging. Analyses of the physiological effects of climate change upon life histories and population demography rarely consider size-dependent foraging and risk of predation. We embedded a state-dependent energetic model in an ecosystem size spectrum to model prey availability (foraging) and risk of predation (fear) experienced by individual fish as they grow. We found that asymptotic growth emerged from size-based foraging and reproductive and mortality patterns in the context of ecosystem food web interactions, without a priori assumptions about the onset of reproduction. While more productive ecosystems led to larger maximum body sizes, the effects of temperature on body size were surprisingly small. To validate our model, we ran it for abiotic scenarios corresponding to the three ecological lifestyles of tunas, considering environments that included seasonal variation in temperature. We successfully predicted realistic patterns of growth, reproduction, and mortality of all three tuna species with distinct ecological lifestyles. Unexpectedly, we found that individuals grew larger when they experienced higher productivity or colder temperatures for part of the year, due to seasonal migrations. This increase in body size emerged because spawning opportunities were seasonally constrained, and explains the evolution of gigantism in temperate tunas. Our approach combines direct and indirect effects of productivity (foodscapes) and individual risk (fearscapes) with metabolic processes and offers a promising approach to understand fish life-history responses to changing ocean conditions.",

    "abstract": "A major unresolved question in the origin and evolution of life is whether a continuous path from geochemical precursors to the majority of molecules in the biosphere can be reconstructed from modern day biochemistry. Here we simulated the emergence of ancient metabolic networks and identified a feasible path from simple geochemically plausible precursors (e.g., phosphate, sulfide, ammonia, simple carboxylic acids, and metals) using only known biochemical reactions and models of primitive coenzymes. We find that purine synthesis constitutes a bottleneck for metabolic expansion, and that non-autocatalytic phosphoryl coupling agents are necessary to enable expansion from geochemistry to modern metabolic networks. Our model predicts punctuated phases of metabolic evolution characterized by the emergence of small molecule coenzymes (e.g., ATP, NAD+, FAD). Early phases in the resulting expansion are associated with enzymes that are metal dependent and structurally symmetric, supporting models of early biochemical evolution. This expansion trajectory produces distinct hypotheses regarding the timing and mode of metabolic pathway evolution, including a late appearance of methane metabolisms and oxygenic photosynthesis consistent with the geochemical record. The concordance between biological and geological analysis suggests that this trajectory provides a plausible evolutionary history for the vast majority of core biochemistry.",

    "abstract": "Previous research has demonstrated that humans combine multiple sources of spatial information such as self-motion and landmark cues, while navigating through an environment. However, it is unclear whether this involves comparing multiple representations obtained from different sources during navigation (parallel hypothesis) or building a representation first based on self-motion cues and then combining with landmarks later (serial hypothesis). We tested these two hypotheses (parallel vs. serial) in an active navigation task using wireless mobile scalp EEG recordings. Participants walked through an immersive virtual hallway with or without conflicts between self-motion and landmarks (i.e., intersections) and pointed toward the starting position of the hallway. We employed the oscillatory signals recorded during mobile wireless scalp EEG as means of identifying when participant representations based on self-motion vs. landmark cues might have first emerged. We found that path segments, including intersections present early during navigation, were more strongly associated with later pointing error, regardless of when they appeared during encoding. We also found that there was sufficient information contained within the frontal-midline theta and posterior alpha oscillatory signals in the earliest segments of navigation involving intersections to decode condition (i.e., conflicting vs. not conflicting). Together, these findings suggest that intersections play a pivotal role in the early development of spatial representations, suggesting that memory representations for the geometry of walked paths likely develop early during navigation, in support of the parallel hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "To make contextually appropriate predictions in a stochastic environment, the brain needs to take uncertainty into account. Prediction error neurons have been identified in layer 2/3 of diverse brain areas. How uncertainty modulates prediction error activity and hence learning is, however, unclear. Here, we use a normative approach to derive how prediction errors should be modulated by uncertainty and postulate that such uncertainty-modulated prediction errors (UPE) are represented by layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons. We further hypothesise that the layer 2/3 circuit calculates the UPE through the subtractive and divisive inhibition by different inhibitory cell types, such as somatostatin-positive (SST), and parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons. By implementing the calculation of UPEs in a microcircuit model, we show that different cell types in cortical circuits can compute the means and variances of the stimulus distribution. With local activity-dependent plasticity rules, these computations can be learned context-dependently, and allow the prediction of upcoming stimuli and their distribution. Finally, we show that the resulting UPEs allow an organism to optimise its learning strategy with respect to external circumstances by enabling adaptive learning rates.",

    "abstract": "Demographic studies that quantify species performances for survival, growth, and reproduction are powerful means to understand and predict how species and communities respond to environmental change through the characterization of population dynamics and sources of demographic bottlenecks. However, demographic studies require fine-scale surveys of populations in the field, and are often too effort-intensive to be replicable at large scale and in the long-term. To surpass this obstacle, we developed a digital approach for extracting demographic data on species abundances, sizes, and positions within video-transects, facilitating back-from-the-field data acquisitions on population and community dynamics from video surveys. The approach is based on manual coral identification, size-measurements, and mapping along video-transects, mimicking what is traditionally performed in the field, thought it can be automated in the future with the deployment of artificial intelligence. We illustrate our approach with the characterizations of species demographic performances using surveys of a reef-building coral community in New Caledonia recorded with underwater cameras, therefore optimizing time spent in the field. The results provide quantitative measures of coral community composition and demographic performances as key ecological indicators of coral reef health, shed light on species life strategies and constraints to their demographics, and open paths for further quantitative investigations. Key findings include the diversity of species life strategies in terms of relative investment in survival, growth, and reproduction found among taxa dominating the coral community, indicating the diversity of demographic paths to ecological success and that several species have adapted mechanisms to prevail under limiting hydrodynamic environments. Our approach facilitates image-based extractions of demographic data, helping to accelerate empirical endeavors in ecology and ecosystem management.\n\nAuthor summarySustainable ecosystem management requires comprehension of key ecological processes that affect species resilience. Accurate and reoccurring measurements of species helps us understand how they are responding to various environments and predict what might happen in the future. We developed a digital approach that mimics measurements traditionally performed in the field to measure species abundance, size, and distributions using video records of the ecosystems. This transition to imagery-based surveys helps researchers and managers acquire fine-scale ecological data while optimizing time spent in the field, particularly for studying remote and extreme environments where access is limited. We illustrate the application of our approach by characterizing the dynamics of a coral community in the vast tropical reef system of New Caledonia, where such evaluations of demographic processes controlling coral resilience are inexistent but necessary.",

    "abstract": "The neural tube (NT) has been a hallmark example of embryonic induction and patterning whereby the notochord induces an organiser, the floorplate, that secretes Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) to pattern the surrounding field of neural progenitors. On the other hand, NT organoids (NTOs) formed from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) undergo spontaneous floorplate formation and patterning in the absence of their normal embryonic inducers. Understanding how stem cells undergo regulative organiser formation is a central challenge in biology. Here, we investigated the self-organisation of a SHH-expressing floorplate organiser using clonal NTOs. Expression of FOXA2, a floorplate transcription factor, was initially spatially scattered before resolving into multiple clusters. These FOXA2+ clusters underwent competition and physical sorting, resulting in a stable \"winning\" floorplate. We identified BMP signalling as a key governor of long-range cluster competition. FOXA2+ clusters expressed BMP4 ligand suppressing FOXA2 in receiving cells, while simultaneously expressing the BMP-inhibitor NOGGIN to secure FOXA2+ cluster survival. Genetic mutation of Noggin perturbed the floorplate not only in NTOs but also in vivo at the mid-hindbrain region of the mouse NT. These results demonstrate how the floorplate can form autonomously without its well-known inducer, the notochord, suggesting redundant mechanisms ensuring robustness. Defining molecular pathways that govern organiser self-organisation is critical in harnessing the developmental plasticity of stem cells toward directed tissue engineering.",

Here, a software tool called Trace_y designed to reconstruct the three-dimensional (3D) surface envelopes of individual helical filament structures from topographical AFM height images is presented. Workflow using Trace_y is demonstrated on the structural analysis of individual helical amyloid protein fibrils where the assembly mechanism of heterogeneous, complex and diverse fibril populations from a single amino-acid sequence due to structural polymorphism is not fully understood. The software and the workflow presented here allows the structural information encoded in topographical AFM height images to be extracted and understood as 3D contact point clouds.

In mosquitoes, these cascades consist of clip domain serine proteases (cSPs) and/or their non-catalytic homologs (cSPHs), which form a complex network, whose molecular make-up is not fully understood. Using a systems biology approach, based on a co-expression network of gene family members that function in melanization and co-immunoprecipitation using the serine protease inhibitor (SRPN)2, a key negative regulator of the melanization response in mosquitoes, we identify the cSP CLIPB4 from the African malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae as a central node in this protease network. CLIPB4 is tightly co-expressed with SRPN2 and forms protein complexes with SRPN2 in the hemolymph of immune-challenged female mosquitoes. Genetic and biochemical approaches validate our network analysis and show that CLIPB4 is required for melanization and antibacterial immunity, acting as a prophenoloxidase (proPO)-activating protease, which is inhibited by SRPN2. In addition, we provide novel insight into the structural organization of the cSP network in An. gambiae, by demonstrating that CLIPB4 is able to activate proCLIPB8, a cSP upstream of the proPO-activating protease CLIPB9. These data provide the first evidence that, in mosquitoes, cSPs provide branching points in immune protease networks and deliver positive reinforcement in proPO activation cascades.",

We first developed a vacuole isolation method to identify lipidome changes during the onset of phase separation in early stationary stage cells. We found that phase separated vacuoles are characterized by increases in lipid raft-forming components not found in the whole cell, including a dramatic change in SL composition. Sorting of both SLs and ergosterol into the vacuole membrane is dependent on Npc2, the yeast homologue of the Niemann-Pick Type C2 lipid transporter. Genetic dissection of SL biosynthesis revealed that the composition of vacuole SLs modulates membrane phase separation and micro-lipophagy under glucose restriction.

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen but the immune factors that protect against it remain elusive. In particular, high opsonic IgG titers achieved in preclinical S. aureus animal immunization studies have consistently failed to translate to protection in human clinical trials. Here, we investigated the antibody responses to a conserved surface glycan, Wall Teichoic Acid (WTA). IgM and IgG antibodies specific to WTA were universally present in plasma from healthy individuals. Functionally, WTA-specific IgM outperformed IgG in opsonophagocytic killing of S. aureus and conferred passive protection against S. aureus infection in vivo. In the clinical setting, WTA-specific IgM responses, but not IgG responses, were significantly lower in S. aureus bacteremia patients compared to healthy individuals, correlated with mortality risk and showed impaired bacterial opsonization. Our findings can guide risk stratification of hospitalized patients and inform future design of antibody-based therapies and vaccines against serious S. aureus infection.",

    "abstract": "Gut microbiomes provide numerous physiological benefits for host animals. The role of bacterial members of microbiomes in host physiology is well-documented. However, much less is known about the contributions and interactions of fungal members of the microbiome even though fungi are significant components of many microbiomes, including those of humans and insects. Here, we used antibacterial and antifungal drugs to manipulate the gut microbiome of a Hawaiian picture-wing Drosophila species, D. grimshawi, and identified distinct, sex-specific roles for the bacteria and fungi in microbiome community stability and reproduction. Female oogenesis, fecundity and mating drive were significantly diminished when fungal communities were suppressed. By contrast, male fecundity was more strongly affected by bacterial but not fungal populations. For males and females, suppression of both bacteria and fungi severely reduced fecundity and altered fatty acid levels and composition, implicating the importance of interkingdom interactions on reproduction and lipid metabolism. Overall, our results reveal that bacteria and fungi have distinct, sexually-dimorphic effects on host physiology and interkingdom dynamics in the gut help to maintain microbiome community stability and enhance reproduction.",

    "abstract": "Loss of proteostasis is a highly conserved feature of aging across model organisms and typically results in the accumulation of insoluble protein aggregates. Protein insolubility is a central feature of major age-related neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimers Disease (AD), where hundreds of insoluble proteins associate with aggregated amyloid beta (A{beta}) in senile plaques. Despite the established connection between aging and AD risk, therapeutic approaches to date have overlooked aging and proteome-wide protein insolubility as causal factors, instead focusing on A{beta} and Tau. Here, using an unbiased proteomics approach, we questioned the relationship between A{beta} and age-related protein insolubility. We demonstrate that, in C. elegans, A{beta} expression is sufficient to drive proteome-wide protein insolubility. The A{beta}-driven insoluble proteome bears a highly significant overlap with the aging-driven insoluble proteome, suggesting there exists a core, sub-proteome which is vulnerable to insolubility. Using human genome-wide association studies (GWAS) we show that this insoluble sub proteome is replete with biological processes implicated across not only neurodegenerative diseases but also across a broad array of chronic, age-related diseases (CARDs), providing suggestive evidence that age-related loss of proteostasis could play a role in general CARD risk. Finally, we show that the gut metabolite, Urolithin A, relieves A{beta} toxicity supporting its use in clinical trials for dementia and other age-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "The brain modifies synaptic strengths to store new information via long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). Evidence has mounted that long-term plasticity is controlled via concentrations of calcium ([Ca2+]) in postsynaptic spines. Several mathematical models describe this phenomenon, including those of Shouval, Bear, and Cooper (SBC) (Shouval et al., 2002, 2010) and Graupner and Brunel (GB)(Graupner & Brunel, 2012). Here we suggest a generalized version of the SBC and GB models, based on a fixed point - learning rate (FPLR) framework, where the synaptic [Ca2+] specifies a fixed point toward which the synaptic weight approaches asymptotically at a [Ca2+]-dependent rate. The FPLR framework offers a straightforward phenomenological interpretation of calcium-based plasticity: the calcium concentration tells the synaptic weight where it is going and how fast it goes there. The FPLR framework can flexibly incorporate various experimental findings, including the existence of multiple regions of [Ca2+] where no plasticity occurs, or plasticity in cerebellar Purkinje cells, where the directionality of calcium-based synaptic changes is thought to be reversed relative to cortical and hippocampal neurons. We also suggest a modeling approach that captures the dependency of late-phase plasticity stabilization on protein synthesis. We demonstrate that due to the asymptotic, saturating nature of synaptic changes in the FPLR rule, the result of frequency- and spike-timing-dependent plasticity protocols are weight-dependent. Finally, we show how the FPLR framework can explain plateau potential-induced place field formation in hippocampal CA1 neurons, also known as behavioral time scale plasticity (BTSP).",

The Nitrosopumilus maritimus 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA synthetase (ADP-forming) (Nmar_0206) from this cycle represents one of a number of proteins that exhibit increased efficiency over its crenarchaeal counterparts. Nmar_0206 catalyzes the conversion of 4-hydroxybutyrate (4HB) and Coenzyme-A (CoA) to 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA through the dephosphorylation of ATP to ADP, as opposed to AMP as seen in Crenarchaeota. This enzyme reduces energy requirements on the cell, thus reflecting thaumarchaeal success in adapting to low-nutrient environments.\n\nThe first high-resolution structure of Nmar_0206 from Nitrosopumilus maritimus SCM1 reveals a highly conserved interdomain stabilizing loop between the CoA-binding and ATP-grasp domains. Phylogenetic analysis suggests the widespread prevalence of this loop and highlights its underrepresentation within the PDB and its structural importance within the ATP-forming Acetyl-CoA superfamily (ACD).",

    "abstract": "Recent work in the field of neural speech tracking provided evidence for a cortical rep-resentation of speech through superposition of event-related responses to acoustic edges, an idea closely related to the popular linear modeling approach to study cortical syn-chronization to speech via magneto- or electroencephalography (M/EEG). However, it is still unclear to what extent speech-evoked event-related potentials (ERPs) including well-established phenomena, e.g., the N1 selective attention effect, contribute to the regression-based analyses. Here, we addressed this question by analyzing an EEG dataset obtained during a simple multispeaker selective attention task in which participants were cued to attend to only one of two competing speakers. Segmenting the ongoing EEG based on acoustic edges, we were able to replicate previous findings of event-related responses to speech in MEG data with particularly clear P1-N1-P2 complexes. Crucially, speech-evoked ERPs exhibited significant effects of attention in line with the auditory N1 effect. Comparing speech-evoked ERPs to the linear regression results revealed two major find-ings. First, temporal response functions (TRFs) obtained from forward modeling were strongly temporally as well as spatially correlated with corresponding true ERPs. Sec-ond, effects of attention demonstrated by the stimulus reconstruction (SR) accuracies obtained from backward modeling appeared to be driven by a consistent generation of speech-evoked ERPs including the N1 effect. Taken together, our observations reveal a direct link between ERPs to acoustic edges in speech and the linear TRF and SR mod-eling techniques. We emphasize the enhancement in signal-to-noise ratio provided by repeatedly evoked N1 responses to be a critical factor in facilitating the tracking and subsequent higher-order processing of selectively attended speech. In addition to that, the findings imply a cortical speech representation through superimposed speech-evoked ERPs in accordance with recent arguments promoting the neural evoked-response speech tracking model.",

In insulin-secreting pancreatic {beta} cells, a longstanding model posits that the cortical actin layer primarily acts to restrict access of insulin granules to the plasma membrane. Here we test this model and find that stimulating {beta} cells with pro-secretory stimuli (glucose and/or KCl) has little impact on the cortical actin layer. Chemical perturbations of actin polymerization, by either disrupting or enhancing filamentation, dramatically enhances glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. We find that this enhancement does not correlate with the state of the cortical actin layer, suggesting filament disruptors act on insulin secretion independently of the cortical cytoskeleton.",

    "abstract": "There are strong potential benefits of incorporating assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) into conservation programs for the management of threatened amphibians as the global amphibian decline continues. As sperm cryopreservation and other ARTs advance in common species, focus on non-lethal sperm collection methods for threatened amphibians is imperative. We aimed to realise this goal by testing various doses of exogenous hormones for non-lethal induction of spermiation in a threatened frog (Litoria aurea) and develop cold storage and cryopreservation protocols following the recovery of urinic sperm. Our major findings include: (1) that sperm release could be induced in high concentrations with 20 IU/g bodyweight of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG); (2) high levels (>50%) of live, motile sperm could be recovered post-cryopreservation by treating the sperm with 15% v/v DMSO and 1% w/v sucrose pre-freeze; and (3) urinic sperm stored at 5{degrees}C retained motility over a 14-day period. Our findings demonstrate that it is possible to obtain and store large quantities of quality sperm from a threatened amphibian via non-lethal means, representing an important step forward for the use of ARTs in conservation programs for rare and threatened species.\n\nLay SummaryAmphibians are undergoing an extinction crisis unparalleled in any other taxa. The development of assisted reproductive technologies, such as sperm cryopreservation and IVF have an important role to play in the conservation management of amphibians globally. Here we report non-lethal methods of sperm collection and storage in a highly threatened amphibian. Major findings include successfully induced sperm release in high concentrations, retention of [~]50% live, motile sperm after 7 days storing it at 5{degrees}C, and successful recovery of of more than 50% live, motile sperm following cryopreservation. Our results demonstrate the viability of obtaining and storing sperm from rare and threatened species via non-lethal means, providing an important step forward for the use of ARTs in conservation programs around the globe.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with a hyperadrenergic state and paradoxically causes systemic bone loss while accelerating fracture healing. Here, we identify the beta2-adrenergic receptor (Adrb2) as a central mediator of these skeletal manifestations. While the negative effects of TBI on the unfractured skeleton can be explained by the established impact of Adrb2 signaling on bone formation, Adrb2 promotes neovascularization of the fracture callus under conditions of high sympathetic tone, including TBI and advanced age. Mechanistically, norepinephrine stimulates the expression of Vegfa and Cgrp primarily in periosteal cells via Adrb2, both of which synergistically promote the formation of osteogenic type-H vessels in the fracture callus. Accordingly, the beneficial effect of TBI on bone repair is abolished in mice lacking Adrb2 or Cgrp, and aged Adrb2-deficient mice without TBI develop fracture nonunions despite high bone formation in uninjured bone. Pharmacologically, the Adrb2 antagonist propranolol impairs, and the agonist formoterol promotes fracture healing in aged mice by regulating callus neovascularization. Clinically, intravenous beta-adrenergic sympathomimetics are associated with improved callus formation in trauma patients with long bone fractures. Thus, Adrb2 is a novel target for promoting bone healing, and widely used beta-blockers may cause fracture nonunion under conditions of increased sympathetic tone.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=95 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/548550v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cea57corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d29642org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@186ea5aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@83eaae_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Artwork was created in BioRender.\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the progranulin (PGRN) encoding gene, GRN, cause familial frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) and PGRN is also implicated in Parkinsons disease (PD). These mutations result in decreased PGRN expression. PGRN is highly expressed in peripheral immune cells and microglia and regulates cell growth, survival, repair, and inflammation. When PGRN is lost, the lysosome becomes dysfunctional, but the exact mechanism by which PGRN plays a role in lysosome function and how this contributes to inflammation and degeneration is not entirely understood. To better understand the role of PGRN in regulating lysosome function, this study examined how loss of GRN impacts total LAMP1 protein expression and cathepsin activities. Using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting assays were performed to analyze fluorescent signal from LAMP1 (lysosomal marker) and BMV109 (marker for pan-cathepsin activity). GRN-/- MEFs exhibit increased expression of pan-cathepsin activity relative to GRN+/+ MEFs, and significantly impacts expression of LAMP1. The significant increase in pan-cathepsin activity in the GRN-/- MEFs confirms that PGRN loss does alter cathepsin expression, which may be a result of compensatory mechanisms happening within the cell. Using NTAP PGRN added to GRN-/- MEFs, specific cathepsin activity is rescued. Further investigations should include assessing LAMP1 and BMV109 expression in microglia from GRN-/- mice, in the hopes of understanding the role of PGRN in lysosomal function in immune cells of the central nervous system and the diseases in which it is implicated.",

    "abstract": "Killer meiotic drivers (KMDs) skew allele transmission in their favor by killing meiotic progeny not inheriting the driver allele. Despite their widespread presence in eukaryotes, the molecular mechanisms behind their selfish behavior are poorly understood. Here we investigate how the poison and antidote products of a fission yeast wtf-family KMD gene can act antagonistically. Both the poison and the antidote are multi-transmembrane proteins, differing only in their N-terminal cytosolic tails. We find that the antidote employs N-terminal PY motifs to bind Rsp5/NEDD4 family ubiquitin ligases, which ubiquitinate the antidote. Mutating PY motifs or attaching a deubiquitinating enzyme transforms the antidote into a toxic protein. Ubiquitination promotes the transport of the antidote from the trans-Golgi network to the endosome, thereby neutralizing its toxicity and that of the bound poison. We propose that post-translational modification-mediated protein localization and/or activity changes may be a common mechanism governing the antagonistic duality of single-gene KMDs.",

    "abstract": "Molecular motors employ chemical energy to generate unidirectional mechanical output against a track. By contrast to the majority of macroscopic machines, they need to navigate a chaotic cellular environment, potential disorder in the track and Brownian motion. Nevertheless, decades of nanometer-precise optical studies suggest that myosin-5a, one of the prototypical molecular motors, takes uniform steps spanning 13 subunits (36 nm) along its F-actin track. Here, we use high-resolution interferometric scattering (iSCAT) microscopy to reveal that myosin takes strides spanning 22 to 34 actin subunits, despite walking straight along the helical actin filament. We show that cumulative angular disorder in F-actin accounts for the observed proportion of each stride length, akin to crossing a river on variably-spaced stepping stones. Electron microscopy revealed the structure of the stepping molecule. Our results indicate that both motor and track are soft materials that can adapt to function in complex cellular conditions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBulk cancer and minimal residual disease (MRD) are characterised by different molecular drivers and therefore necessitate different therapeutic strategies. However, there are currently no 3D models that can faithfully recapitulate MRD ex vivo for therapy development.\n\nMethodsA microfluidic technique was implemented to construct 3D microtumours, in which tumour cells, either by themselves or with fibroblasts, were encapsulated in viscous hydrogels. The 3D microtumours were analysed for their response to first-line chemotherapeutics and characterised through RNA-Seq, by comparing them to both 2D cultures and clinical samples.\n\nResultsOur microfluidic platform guarantees the fabrication of 3D microtumours of tailorable size and cell content, which recreate key features of tumours such as hypoxia, characteristic organization of the cytoskeleton and a dose-response to chemotherapeutics close to the physiological range. The 3D microtumours were also used to examine non-genetic heterogeneity in ovarian cancer and could fully reflect the recently described \"Oxford Classic\" five molecular signatures.\n\nThe gene expression profile of 3D microtumours following chemotherapy treatment closely resembled that of MRD in ovarian cancer patients, showing the upregulation of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism. We demonstrate that these 3D microtumours are ideal for drug development by showing how they support the identification of a promising inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation, perhexiline, which specifically targets chemotherapy-resistant MRD ovarian cancer cells and not bulk cancer cells.\n\nConclusionWe have obtained the first 3D model of ovarian cancer MRD by using microtumours generated through microfluidics. This system is ideal for high-throughput drug screening and, given its versatility, it can be readily extended to additional types of cancer, as well as accommodate multiple cell types to generate complex tumour microenvironments.",

However, they eventually develop accelerated cardiac aging and cardiac fibrosis, and experience reduced longevity.\n\nHere we show that young (3-month-old) TGAC8 animals are characterized by a broad and extensive inflammatory state, that precedes the development of cardiac fibrosis. We demonstrate that activation of ACVIII in the cardiomyocytes results in cell-autonomous RelA-mediated NF-{kappa}B signaling. This is associated with non-cell-autonomous activation of proinflammatory and age-associated signaling in myocardial endothelial cells, increases in serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, changes in myocardial immune cells, and changes in the size or composition of lymphoid organs. Finally, we provide evidence suggesting that ACVIII-driven RelA activation in cardiomyocytes might be mediated by calcium-Protein Kinase A (PKA) signaling.\n\nOur findings highlight a novel mechanistic connection between cardiomyocyte stress, myocardial para-inflammation, systemic inflammation, and aging, and therefore point to novel potential therapeutic targets to reduce age-associated myocardial deterioration.",

    "abstract": "TERT promoter mutations (TPMs) are frequently found in different cancer types, including approximately 70% of sun-exposed skin melanomas. In melanoma, TPMs are among the earliest mutations and can be present during the transition from nevus to melanoma. However, the specific factors that contribute to the selection of TPMs in certain nevi subsets are not well understood. To investigate this, we analyzed a group of dysplastic nevi (DN) by sequencing genes commonly mutated in melanocytic neoplasms. We examined the relationship between the identified mutations, patient age, telomere length, histological features, and the expression of p16. Our findings reveal that TPMs are more prevalent in DN from older patients and are associated with shorter telomeres. Importantly, these TPMs were not found in nevi with BRAF V600E mutations. Conversely, DN with BRAF V600E mutations were observed in younger patients, had longer telomeres, and a higher proportion of p16-positive cells. This suggests that these nevi arrest growth independently of telomere shortening through a mechanism known as oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). These characteristics extend to melanoma sequencing data sets, where melanomas with BRAF V600E mutations were more likely to have CDKN2A inactivation, overriding OIS. In contrast, melanomas without BRAF V600E mutations showed a higher frequency of TPMs. Our data imply that TPMs are selected to bypass replicative senescence (RS) in cells that were not arrested by OIS. Overall, our results indicate that a subset of melanocytic neoplasms face constraints from RS, while others encounter OIS and RS. The order in which these barriers are overcome during progression to melanoma depends on the mutational context.",

This solves a long standing problem in neuroscience of by 2 - 3 orders of magnitude discrepancy between the observed fast speed of the saltatory conduction in myelinated axons or in C fibers with the upper limit of diffusive ion current velocity in these axons. The latter, described in the framework of so-called cable model, is too low in axons because of poor conductivity of neuron inner cytosol. The compliance with observations has been achieved upon plasmonic model of ionic local oscillations synchronized in periodically corrugated axons and propagating with high speed in the form of wave-type plasmon-polariton without any net diffusion current, thus not limited by resistivity. The new model of stimulus in myelinated axons reveals the different controlling role of myelin than previously thought from cable model. The control mechanism in non-myelinated C fibers is also proposed in agreement with observations.

    "abstract": "Pollution is one of the major drivers of ecosystem change in the Anthropocene. Toxic chemicals are not constrained to their source of origin as they cross ecosystem boundaries via biotic (e.g., animal migration) and abiotic (e.g., water flow) vectors. Meta-ecology has led to important insights on how spatial flows or subsidies of matter across ecosystem boundaries can have broad impacts on local and regional ecosystem dynamics but has not yet addressed the dynamics of pollutants. Understanding how these meta-ecosystem processes on contaminant dynamics may reverberate up a food chain is important even if they might be difficult to predict. Here we derive a modelling framework to predict how spatial ecosystem fluxes can influence contaminant dynamics and how the severity of this impact is dependent on the type of ecosystem flux leading to the spatial coupling (e.g., herbivore movement vs abiotic chemical flows). We mix an analytical and numerical approach to analyze our integrative model which couples two distinct sub-components - an ecosystem model and a contaminant model. We observe an array of dynamics for how chemical concentrations change with increasing nutrient input and loss rate across trophic levels. When we tailor our range of chemical parameter values to specific organic chemicals our results demonstrate that increasing nutrient input rates can lead to trophic dilution in pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls across trophic levels. Yet, increasing nutrient loss rate causes an increase in concentrations of chemicals across all trophic levels. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates that nutrient recycling is an important ecosystem process impacting contaminant concentrations, generating predictions to be addressed by future empirical studies. Importantly, our model demonstrates the utility of our framework for identifying drivers of contaminant dynamics in connected ecosystems including the importance that a) ecosystem processes, and b) movement, especially movement of lower trophic levels, have on contaminant concentrations. For example, how increasing nutrient loss rate leads to increasing contaminant concentrations, or how movement of lower trophic levels contributes to elevated herbivore contaminant concentrations. This dynamic is particularly relevant given that the flow of matter between ecosystems also serves as a vector for the transport of contaminants.",

We found that NPP recovery often remains incomplete (42% of sites), except in cold precipitation regimes with low precipitation, and recovery of total shrub cover (median timing of 81 years) was faster on fine-textured soils. Locations with quick recovery of shrub cover were linked with a shift in dominant shrub species and incomplete NPP recovery.

The soybean genome is characterized by a large extent of duplicated genes. However, the extent and mechanisms of functional divergence among these duplicated genes in soybean remain poorly understood. In this study, we revealed that tandem duplication of MYB genes, which occurred specifically in the Phaseoleae lineage, exhibited a stronger purifying selection in soybean compared to common bean. To gain insights into the diverse functions of these MYB genes in anthocyanin biosynthesis, we examined the expression, transcriptional activity, metabolite, and evolutionary history of four MYB genes (GmMYBA5, GmMYBA2, GmMYBA1 and Glyma.09g235000), which were presumably generated by tandem duplication in soybean. Our data revealed that Glyma.09g235000 had become a pseudogene, while the remaining three MYB genes exhibited strong transcriptional activation activity and promoted anthocyanin biosynthesis in different soybean tissues. Furthermore, GmMYBA5 produced distinct compounds in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves compared to GmMYBA2 and GmMYBA1 due to variations in their DNA binding domains. The lower expression of anthocyanin related genes in GmMYBA5 resulted in lower levels of anthocyanins compared to GmMYBA2 and GmMYBA1. Metabolomics analysis further demonstrated the diverse and differential downstream metabolites, suggesting their functional divergence in metabolites following gene duplication. Together, our data provided evidence of functional divergence within the MYB gene cluster following tandem duplication, which shed light on the potential evolutionary direction of gene duplications during legume evolution.",

A successful pathogen undergoes a complex and well-timed sequence of regulatory changes to avoid detection by the host immune system, hence well-tuned gene regulation is essential for survival. However, the extent to which the regulatory polymorphisms in a pathogen population provide an adaptive advantage is poorly understood.\n\nResultsWe used Zymoseptoria tritici, one of the most important pathogens of wheat, to generate a genome-wide map of regulatory polymorphism governing gene expression. We investigated genome-wide transcription levels of 146 strains grown under nutrient starvation and performed expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping. We identified cis-eQTLs for 65.3% of all genes and the majority of all eQTL loci are within 2kb upstream and downstream of the transcription start site (TSS). We also show that polymorphism in different gene elements contributes disproportionally to gene expression variation. Investigating regulatory polymorphism in gene categories, we found an enrichment of regulatory variants for genes predicted to be important for fungal pathogenesis but with comparatively low effect size, suggesting a separate layer of gene regulation involving epigenetics. We also show that previously reported trait-associated SNPs in pathogen populations are frequently cis-regulatory variants of neighboring genes with implications for the trait architecture.\n\nConclusionsOverall, our study provides extensive evidence that single populations segregate large-scale regulatory variation and are likely to fuel rapid adaptation to resistant hosts and environmental change.",

The Macaronesian laurel forest (MLF), a relict subtropical evergreen forest of the North Atlantic islands, shares climatic and some taxonomic affinities with those areas affected by SOD. To assess the disease risk, we tested the foliage susceptibility of MLF species and their capacity to sustain Pr sporulation and compared the climatic suitability with other areas where the pathogen is established. Detached leaves of 15 species were inoculated with zoospores and mycelium (through wounding) with five Pr isolates belonging to the EU1 and NA1 clonal lineages. MLF species showed diverse responses to Pr, ranging from extensive necroses on Viburnum tinus to asymptomatic sporulation on Picconia excelsa. Eleven species developed necrotic lesions to different degrees through zoospore inoculation while this increased to 13 species through wound treatment. Overall, small necrotic lesions (i.e. tolerance) were predominant, but Pr was rather aggressive to V. tinus, Arbutus canariensis and Ilex canariensis. Although the mean sporangial production was generally low (25-201 sporangia) in all species, the number of sporangia per leaf in five MLF species was similar to those reported for Umbellularia californica, a key host driving the SOD epidemics in California. Climatic suitability indexes in MLF areas were similar to those where SOD is found in California. Our results indicate a moderate to high risk of Pr establishment if the pathogen is introduced in the MLF.",

    "abstract": "Although benzene degradation under strictly anoxic conditions was first reported over 25 years ago, the mechanism for benzene activation in the absence of oxygen is still elusive. A major limitation has been the difficulty to grow anaerobic benzene-degrading enrichment cultures. Our laboratory has maintained a methanogenic enrichment culture for decades, harboring a benzene fermenter referred to as Desulfobacterota ORM2. Recent genomic analyses indicate that ORM2 is not affiliated with any characterized genus, but it is phylogenetically similar to several other known and predicted benzene degraders. Desulfobacterota ORM2 has a doubling time of approximately 30 days and often enters a long lag or decay phase after inoculation into sterile pre-reduced anaerobic medium. A specific fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) probe was used to observe Desulfobacterota ORM2 cells during this decay phase, revealing a rod-shaped cell of variable length with a tendency to associate with other cells, particularly methanogens. Microscopic and genomic analyses indicate that Desulfobacterota ORM2 may produce extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that likely contribute to cell aggregation. The production of EPS may consume a significant amount of energy, perhaps contributing to the lag time before onset of growth of Desulfobacterota ORM2 post-inoculation. We observed little cell aggregation in a culture amended with very high concentrations of benzene (90-120 mg/L). This study visualized the cells of a novel clade within the Desulfobacterota for the first time, enabling monitoring of spatial organization within a methanogenic consortium and provides hints to improve the growth rate of ORM2.\n\nImportanceA specific FISH probe was designed for the poorly characterized benzene fermenter Desulfobacterota ORM2. This probe was used to monitor changes in spatial organization in a methanogenic benzene-degrading enrichment culture.

As suggested, exogenous maresin-2 supplement facilitated autophagosome formation by microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B (LC3) conjugation system under the modulation of O-GlcNAcylation dependent ULK1 activation, whereas reversed by ULK1 S409A and S422A mutagenesis, showcasing the potential O-GlcNAc (O-linked {beta}- N-acetylglucosamine) modifiable sites on ULK1. Moreover, we found that hereafter maresin-2 treatment glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase 1 (GFAT1) which is accessary to sense hexosamine biosynthesis influx is more likely the prime checkpoint for conjugating O-terminal {beta}-N-acetylglucosamine motif onto ULK1, rather than O-linked N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (OGT). Mechanistically, maresin-2 largely prohibits transforming growth factor-{beta} (TGF-{beta})-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), therefore increasing the availability of TAB1 for GFAT1, which encourages O-GlcNAcylation of ULK1.",

Differences in eye size within and between Drosophila species provide the opportunity to study the impact of eye structure on vision. Here we further explored differences in D. mauritiana and its sibling species D. simulans and confirmed that D. mauritiana have rapidly evolved larger eyes as a result of more and wider ommatidia than D. simulans since their recent common ancestor. The functional impact of eye size, and specifically ommatidia size, is often only estimated based on the rigid surface morphology of the compound eye. Therefore, we used 3D synchrotron radiation tomography to measure optical parameters in 3D, predict optical capacity, and compare the modelled vision to in vivo optomotor responses. Our optical models predicted higher contrast sensitivity for D. mauritiana, which we verified by presenting sinusoidal gratings to tethered flies in a flight arena. Similarly, we confirmed the higher spatial acuity predicted for Drosophila simulans with smaller ommatidia and found evidence for higher temporal resolution.",

    "abstract": "Arthropod vectors such as mites and ticks introduce an alternative viral transmission route between their hosts. The ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor is the leading threat to the health of Western honey bees (Apis mellifera) primarily through its action as a vector of viruses. However, it is unclear whether viruses transmitted by V. destructor actively infect and replicate in mites, which could facilitate increased transmission and select for more virulent strains. To better understand the role of V. destructor as a vector, we took advantage of differences between bee and mite antiviral RNA interference pathways to identify the host specificity of replicating viruses. We used small RNA sequencing of individual V. destructor mites to examine viral small interfering RNA (vsiRNA) profiles of Deformed wing virus genotypes (DWV-A and DWV-B), associated with colony declines, as well as nine other viruses present in our samples. We found active replication of six V. destructor-associated viruses, including a novel virus, Varroa destructor virus 9 (VDV-9), and replication of two honey bee associated viruses, including both DWV-A and -B genotypes, suggesting that mites are biological vectors for important bee pathogens. We show that the antiviral RNAi response can be used define the host range of viruses in host-parasite interactions, such as honey bees and their parasites, enabling a better understanding of the role of a vector in the evolution and spread of honey bee pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Stay green (SG) in wheat, a beneficial trait for increasing yield and stress resistance, needs to be supported by analysis of the underlying genetic basis. Spectral reflectance indices (SIs) provide non-destructive tools to evaluate crop temporal senescence. However, few SI-based SG quantification pipelines for analyzing diverse wheat panels in the field are available. Here, we first applied SIs to monitor the senescence dynamics of 565 diverse wheat accessions from anthesis to maturation stages during two field seasons. Based on over 12,000 SIs data set, four SIs (NDVI, GNDVI, NDRE and OSAVI) were selected to develop relative stay green scores (RSGS) and the senescence of wheat populations occurs mainly at four developmental stages stage 1 (S1) to S4, accounting for the final SG indicators. A RSGS-based genome-wide association study identified 47 high-confidence quantitative trait loci (QTL) harboring 3,079 SNPs significantly associated with RSGS and 1,085 corresponding candidate genes in the two seasons; 15 QTL overlapped or were adjacent to known SG-related QTL or genes and the remaining QTL were novel. Finally, we selected three superior candidate genes (TraesCS6B03G0356400, TraesCS2B03G1299500, and TraesCS2A03G1081100) as examples by transcriptomes, gene annotation, and gene-based association analysis for further analysis and found that utilization of superior SG-related variation in China gradually increased following the Green Revolution. The study provides a useful reference for further SG-related gene discovery of favorable variations in diverse wheat panels.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional enhancers must find their target genes both efficiently and specifically. Chromatin conformation capture revealed the critical function of three-dimensional chromosome segmentation by topologically associated domains (TADs) to limit the search space of enhancers for promoters in mammals. In nematodes, although more than 30000 sequences with characteristic enhancer chromatin features have been identified, the autosomal genome is not segmented by TADs, raising the question of the mechanism directing enhancer-promoter specificity. Using high-resolution HiC, we show that enhancer loci correlate with 3D hairpin-like structures extending 10-50 kb from the enhancers, hereafter designated as fountains. Fountains are specific to active enhancers, accumulate the major somatic cohesin and disappear when the latter is cleaved in vivo. Fountains accumulate topological constraints and are enriched for topoisomerases and the negatively-supercoiled DNA binder psoralen. Short-term topoisomerase depletion leads to small-scale structural changes at the fountain tip. Functionally, fountain disappearance correlates with enhancer-proximal gene activation, suggesting fountains play a similar role as TADs and direct enhancer-promoter interactions, in particular for genes expressed in neurons. We directly observe this cell-type specific upregulation for the skn-1/Nrf gene in a pair of head neurons. Phenotypically, cohesin cleavage has a major impact on nematode movement and foraging attitudes, demonstrating that changes in neuronal gene expression impact nervous system function, reminiscent of pathologies caused by cohesin mutations in humans. Together, this study highlights a clear link between 3D genome organization at enhancers by cohesin, transcriptional gene regulation and animal behavior.",

    "abstract": "RationaleADHD is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by inattention and impulsivity. Stimulants such as amphetamine are the most common pharmacological treatment for ADHD. However, such stimulants have substantial abuse and dependence risk. For example, stimulants (smart pills) are commonly used by students to enhance academic performance. Therefore, there is a pressing need for new therapeutic agents. Dysfunction of the dopaminergic system has been associated with ADHD symptoms. D1 receptors play an important role in the cognitive enhancing effects of stimulants and thus may provide a therapeutic target. Previous pre-clinical studies have shown that selective activation of D1 receptors improves sustained attention in the 5C-CPT without improving waiting impulsivity. The present study extends this work to investigate the effect of selective activation of D1 receptors on waiting impulsivity as measured by 5C-CPT.\n\nObjectiveThe aim of the present experiment was to compare the effects of the selective D1 receptor agonist SKF 38393 to a standard ADHD treatment (amphetamine) on waiting impulsivity in the 5C-CPT under extended inter-trial intervals.\n\nMethodsAdult female Lister hooded rats were trained to criterion in the 5C-CPT. After rats were able to distinguish target from non-target trials the effects of the selective D1 receptor agonist SKF 38393 (2-6 mg/kg) or amphetamine (0.1-0.4 mg/kg) were investigated under behavioural manipulations to challenge inhibitory response control and, to a lesser extent, attentional resources. The traditional method of analysing drug effects on group data (or sub-groups of high and low performers) was compared with correlational analysis using Oldham method to determine if drug treatment affected waiting impulsivity in a baseline dependent manner.\n\nResultsThe highest dose of SKF 38393 selectively improved waiting impulsivity in a baseline dependent manner without having a significant effect on sustained attention or response inhibition. The two highest doses of amphetamine improved waiting impulsivity in a baseline dependent manner without having a significant effect on sustained attention and response inhibition.\n\nConclusionsThe effects of AMPH on waiting impulsivity further supports the predictive validity of 5C-CPT. In addition, this study taken together with previous studies which report pro attentional effects of D1 receptor agonists suggests that D1 selective agonists could be therapeutically beneficial in ADHD patients. Clinical trials are needed to confirm these effects. This is the first study to take advantage of the variation in individual baseline waiting impulsivity to demonstrate the presence of a rate-dependent relationship between baseline waiting impulsivity and magnitude of improvement following stimulant or non-stimulant medications. Oldhams correlation method may present an opportunity to enhance the translational value of research in the preclinical laboratory to the clinic. Furthermore, these findings further support the ability of 5C-CPT to distinguish between response inhibition and waiting impulsivity and allow symptom specific treatment.",

    "abstract": "Sperm modulate their flagellar symmetry to navigate through complex physico-chemical environments and achieve reproductive function. Yet it remains elusive how sperm swim forwards despite the inherent asymmetry of several components that constitutes the flagellar engine. Despite the critical importance of symmetry, or the lack of it, on sperm navigation and its physiological state, there is no methodology to date that can robustly detect the symmetry state of the beat in free-swimming sperm in 3D. How does symmetric progressive swimming emerge even for asymmetric beating, and how can beating (a)symmetry be inferred experimentally? Here, we numerically resolve the fluid mechanics of swimming around asymmetrically beating spermatozoa. This reveals that sperm spinning critically regularizes swimming into persistently symmetric paths in 3D, allowing sperm to swim forwards despite any imperfections on the beat. The sperm orientation in three-dimensions, and not the swimming path, can inform the symmetry state of the beat, eliminating the need of tracking the flagellum in 3D. We report a surprising correspondence between the movement of sperm and spinning-top experiments, indicating that the flagellum drives \"spinning-top\" type rotations during sperm swimming, and that this parallel is not a mere analogy. These results may prove essential in future studies on the role of (a)symmetry in spinning and swimming microorganisms and micro-robots, as body orientation detection has been vastly overlooked in favour of swimming path detection. Altogether, sperm rotation may provide a foolproof mechanism for forward propulsion and navigation in nature that would otherwise not be possible for flagella with broken symmetry.",

    "abstract": "Filamentous multicellular cable bacteria perform centimeter-scale electron transport in a process that couples oxidation of an electron donor (sulfide) in deeper sediment to the reduction of an electron acceptor (oxygen or nitrate) near the surface. While this electric metabolism is prevalent in both marine and freshwater sediments, detailed electronic measurements of the conductivity previously focused on the marine cable bacteria (Candidatus Electrothrix), rather than freshwater cable bacteria, which form a separate genus (Candidatus Electronema) and contribute essential geochemical roles in freshwater sediments. Here, we characterize the electron transport characteristics of Ca. Electronema cable bacteria from Southern California freshwater sediments. Current-voltage measurements of intact cable filaments bridging interdigitated electrodes confirmed their persistent conductivity under a controlled atmosphere and the variable sensitivity of this conduction to air exposure. Electrostatic and conductive atomic force microscopies mapped out the characteristics of the cell envelopes nanofiber network, implicating it as the conductive pathway in a manner consistent with previous findings in marine cable bacteria. Four-probe measurements of microelectrodes addressing intact cables demonstrated nanoampere currents up to 200 m lengths at modest driving voltages, allowing us to quantify the nanofiber conductivity at 0.1 S/cm for freshwater cable bacteria filaments under our measurement conditions. Such a high conductivity can support the remarkable sulfide-to-oxygen electrical currents mediated by cable bacteria in sediments. These measurements expand the knowledgebase of long-distance electron transport to the freshwater niche while shedding light on underlying conductive network of cable bacteria.\n\nSignificanceCable bacteria are multicellular filaments composed of up-to-thousands of end-to-end cells and are found worldwide in both marine and freshwater sediments. Remarkably, these cells gain energy from a long-distance electron transport process that carries electrons generated by sulfide oxidation in deeper sediment layers to drive oxygen reduction near the sediment-water interface. This electric metabolism requires an unusually high electronic conductivity, previously thought impossible in natural biological materials. However, the underlying mechanism(s) remain poorly understood, and previous characterization of the conductivity largely focused on marine cable bacteria. Here, we characterize and quantify the electronic conductivity of freshwater cable bacteria from sediments in Southern California, with emphasis on the role of the conductive periplasmic fiber network in routing electron transport along cables.",

    "abstract": "Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common musculoskeletal disorder, characterized by fibrosis of the subsynovial connective tissue (SSCT) mediated by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-{beta}). Risk factors for CTS include metabolic dysfunction and age. Additionally, the incidence of CTS is higher in women. In this study we hypothesized that a high-fat diet (HFD), a common driver of metabolic dysfunction, would promote SSCT fibrosis found in CTS and that this response would be sex dependent. To test this, we examined the effects of HFD and sex on SSCT fibrosis using our established rabbit model of CTS. Forty-eight (24 male, 24 female) adult rabbits were divided into four groups including HFD or standard diet with and without CTS induction. SSCT was collected for histological and gene expression analysis. HFD promoted SSCT thickening and upregulated profibrotic genes, including TGF-{beta}. Fibrotic genes were differentially expressed in males and females. Interestingly while the prevalence of CTS is greater in women than in men, the converse is observed in the presence of metabolic dysfunction. This work recapitulates this clinical observation and begins to elucidate the sex-based differences found in SSCT fibrosis. This knowledge should drive further research and may lead to metabolic and sex specific therapeutic strategies for the treatment of patients with CTS.",

    "abstract": "We assessed the feasibility of using stop-codons as means to obtain polycistronic expression in eukaryotic cells. We show robust bicistronic expression of different open reading frames (ORFs), when these are cloned in-sequence and simply separated by stop codons (in-or out-of-frame), in heterologous expression systems and primary neurons. We further find this method to support polycistronic expression of three stop-codon-separated ORFs in vivo, which guided us to develop a technicolor Genetically-Encoded Functional Rainbow Indicators (GEFRIs) for monitoring cellular morphology and neuronal firing, concomitantly. These findings guided us to develop a new technique we denote SPLIT--Stop-codon mediated Polycistronic Induction in HeTerologous expression systems-- for rapid and easy development of fragmented proteins by the sole use of stop codons. We validated the SPLIT method by generating several new split-GFP variants, then engineer a palette of functional split-GCaMP6s variants and, lastly, generate a split ca2+-probe localized at ER and mitochondria junctions, denoted split-MEGIC. With the use of the probe, we show presence and activity of mito-ER contact sites within individual dendritic spines. Split-MEGIC can thereby be imaged by two-photon excitation in vivo in mice brains and, by standard confocal microscope in transgenic zebrafish larvae. Together, we explore non-canonical translation mechanisms and show these to be highly pervasive in various cell types in vitro and in vivo. We harness translation re-initiation to express multiple ORFs, to engineer rainbow indicators and to swiftly produce functional split-proteins and probes.",

    "abstract": "Cilia and flagella play a crucial role in the development and function of most eukaryotic organisms. The structural core of the flagellum, the axoneme, is conserved in most eukaryotes and careful regulation of dynein motors within the axoneme is required for proper ciliary beating. The sperm flagellum from the American eel (Anguilla rostrata) has been shown to lack many of the canonical axonemal proteins, including the radial spokes, the central pair complex, and possibly even the outer row of dynein arms, presenting a \"minimal\" flagellar system. Here, we present cryo-electron tomography analysis of the eel sperm flagellum. We identified two states for the eel sperm flagellum within our tomograms, narrow and wide, and found that the flagellum started narrow near the sperm head and widened distally. Subtomogram averages revealed that the eel sperm flagellum has retained remnants of the missing regulatory complexes, including a short radial spoke 3 complex, basal components of radial spokes 1 and 2, and an outer dynein arm docking complex. We also describe unique structural features of the A. rostrata sperm flagellum, such as a unique pattern of holes at the inner junction and an accessory complex located at the \"outer\" junction. Finally, we discuss the consequences of losing key regulatory factors for the eel sperm flagellum and hypothesize several evolutionary factors that may have led to their loss. Together, our results shed light onto the structure and function of the eel sperm axoneme and provide insight into the minimum requirements for proper ciliary beating.",

    "abstract": "Increasingly frequent marine heatwaves are devastating coral reefs. Corals that survive these extreme heat stress events must rapidly recover if they are to withstand subsequent events, and long-term survival in the face of rising ocean temperatures may hinge on recovery capacity and acclimatory gains in heat tolerance over an individuals lifespan. To better understand coral recovery trajectories in the face of successive marine heatwaves, we monitored the responses of bleaching-susceptible and bleaching-resistant individuals of two dominant coral species in Hawaii, Montipora capitata and Porites compressa, over a decade that included three marine heatwaves. Bleaching-susceptible colonies of P. compressa exhibited beneficial acclimatization to heat stress (i.e., less bleaching) following repeat heatwaves, becoming indistinguishable from bleaching-resistant conspecifics during and after the third heatwave. In contrast, bleaching-susceptible M. capitata repeatedly bleached during all successive heatwaves and exhibited seasonal bleaching for up to three years following the third heatwave. Encouragingly, bleaching-resistant individuals of both species remained pigmented across the entire time series; however, pigmentation did not necessarily indicate physiological resilience. Specifically, M. capitata displayed incremental yet only partial recovery of symbiont density and tissue biomass across both bleaching phenotypes up to 35 months following the third heatwave. Conversely, P. compressa appeared to recover across most physiological metrics within two years, reverting to predictable seasonal variability. Ultimately, these results indicate that even some visually robust, bleaching-resistant corals can carry the cost of recurring heatwaves over multiple years, leading to divergent recovery trajectories that may erode coral reef resilience in the Anthropocene.\n\nSignificance StatementCoral reefs are in jeopardy as climate change has led to increasingly frequent marine heatwaves. Some corals can survive these extreme heat stress events, thus acquiring environmental memory that may prime them for increased resistance and resilience in subsequent heatwaves via beneficial acclimatization. Yet, as the time between heatwaves decreases, the accumulation of stress experienced by some individuals may preclude opportunities for beneficial acclimatization. This nearly decade-long study revealed divergent recovery trajectories within and between species in response to successive marine heatwaves, ranging from costly to beneficial. As the climate continues to change, surviving corals must not only gain heat tolerance, but also rapidly recover to maintain the critically important ecosystem services that humanity relies on.",

    "abstract": "Gene drive systems could be a viable strategy to prevent pathogen transmission or suppress vector populations by propagating drive alleles with super-Mendelian inheritance. CRISPR-based homing gene drives, perhaps the most powerful gene drive strategy, convert wild type alleles into drive alleles in heterozygotes with the help of Cas9 and gRNA. However, achieving successful outcomes with these drives often requires high performance. Specifically, it is desirable to identify Cas9 promoters that yield high drive conversion rates, minimize the formation rate of resistance alleles in both the germline and the early embryo, and limit somatic Cas9 expression. Thus far, high-performance promoters have only been discovered in Anopheles species. In Drosophila, the nanos promoter avoids leaky somatic expression, but at the cost of high embryo resistance from maternally deposited Cas9. To improve drive efficiency, we tested eleven Drosophila melanogaster germline promoters in several configurations. Some of the new promoters achieved higher drive conversion efficiency with minimal embryo resistance, but none could completely avoid somatic expression like nanos. However, such somatic expression often did not carry detectable fitness costs when the promoter-Cas9 elements supported a rescue homing drive targeting a haplolethal gene, suggesting somatic drive conversion. Based on our findings, we selected two Cas9 promoter lines for cage experiments with a 4-gRNA suppression drive. While one promoter exhibited substantial somatic effects, leading to a low drive equilibrium frequency, the other outperformed nanos, resulting in the successful suppression of the cage population. Overall, these novel Cas9 promoters hold potential advantages for homing drives in Drosophila species and may also possess valuable homologs in other organisms.",

    "abstract": "The neural stimulation of the vagus nerve is able to modulate various functions of the parasympathetic response in different organs. The stimulation of the vagus nerve is a promising approach to treating inflammatory diseases, obesity, diabetes, heart failure, and hypertension. The complexity of the vagus nerve requires highly selective stimulation, allowing the modulation of target-specific organs without side effects. Here, we address this issue by adapting a neural stimulator and developing an intraneural electrode for the particular modulation of the vagus nerve. The neurostimulator parameters such as amplitude, pulse width, and pulse shape were modulated. Single-, and multi-channel stimulation was performed at different amplitudes. For the first time, I polyimide thin-film neural electrode was designed for the specific stimulation of the vagus nerve. In vivo experiments were performed in the adult minipig to validate to elicit electrically evoked action potentials and to modulate physiological functions selectively, validating the selectivity of intraneural stimulation. Electrochemical tests of the electrode and the neurostimulator showed that the stimulation hardware was working correctly. Stimulating the porcine vagus nerve resulted in selective modulation of the vagus nerve. Alpha, beta, and theta waves could be distinguished during single- and multi-channel stimulation. We have shown that the here presented system is able to activate the vagus nerve selectively and can therefore modulate the heart rate, diastolic pressure, and systolic pressure. The here presented system may be used to restore the cardiac loop after denervation by implementing biomimetic stimulation patterns. Presented methods may be used to develop intraneural electrodes adapted for various applications.",

Although approaches vary in their exploration of the sequence-structure-function paradigm, they are often hampered by the labor-intensive steps of protein expression and screening. In this work, we describe the development and testing of a high throughput in silico sequence-structure-function pipeline using AlphaFold2 and Fast Fourier Transform docking that is benchmarked with enantioselectivity and reactivity predictions for an ancestral sequence library of fungal flavin-dependent monooxygenases. The predicted enantioselectivities and reactivities correlate well with previously described screens of an experimentally available subset of these proteins and capture known changes in enantioselectivity across the phylogenetic tree representing ancestorial proteins from this family. With this pipeline established as our functional screen, we apply ensemble decision tree models and explainable AI techniques to build sequence function models and extract critical residues within the binding site and the second sphere residues around this site. We demonstrate that the top-identified key residues in the control of enantioselectivity and reactivity correspond to experimentally verified residues. The in silico sequence-to-function pipeline serves as an accelerated framework to inform protein engineering efforts.",

Current control strategies of the insect vector rely on mechanical management of nymphal stages and insecticide application against adult populations. Entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) are biological control agents naturally attacking spittlebugs and may effectively reduce population levels of host species. Different experimental trials in controlled conditions have been performed to i) identify naturally occurring EPF on P. spumarius in Northwestern Italy, and ii) evaluate the potential for biocontrol of the isolated strains on both nymphal and adult stages of the spittlebug. Four EPF species were isolated from dead P. spumarius cadavers collected in semi-field conditions: Beauveria bassiana, Conidiobolus coronatus, Fusarium equiseti and Lecanicillium aphanocladii. All the fungal isolates showed entomopathogenic potential against nymphal stages of P. spumarius ({approx} 45 % mortality), except for F. equiseti, in preliminary trials. No induced mortality was observed on the adult stage. Lecanicillium aphanocladii was the most promising fungus and its pathogenicity against spittlebug nymphs was further tested in different formulations (conidia vs blastospores) and with natural adjuvants. Blastospore formulation was the most effective in killing nymphal instars and reducing the emergence rate of P. spumarius adults, reaching mortality levels (90%) similar to those of the commercial product Naturalis(R), while no or adverse effect of natural adjuvants was recorded. The encouraging results of this study pave the way for testing EPF isolates against P. spumarius in field conditions and find new environmentally friendly control strategies against insect vectors of X. fastidiosa.",

    "abstract": "Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common cause of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). The leading cause of AKI worldwide is Ischaemia Reperfusion Injury (IRI), seen most commonly in the clinical setting as a result of sepsis-driven hypotension. We are increasingly recognising, however, that AKI and CKD are one closely associated continuum of disease, rather than distinct entities. Ischaemic Preconditioning (IPC) is a strategy aimed at reducing the deleterious effects of IRI. This study demonstrates an efficacious model of kidney IRI, and the protective influence of IPC in attenuating renal injury/fibrosis.\n\nA rat model of bilateral kidney IRI was used: Male Lewis rats (n=84) were assigned to IRI, sham or IPC. In IRI, renal pedicles were clamped for 45 minutes. IPC groups underwent pulsatile IPC prior to IRI. Kidneys were retrieved at 24-hours, 48-hours, 7-days, 14-days and 28-days, and assessed histologically.\n\nIRI led to marked histological damage and renal fibrosis development by 28 days. Histological injury scores and degree of fibrosis were significantly increased following IRI and attenuated with IPC. IPC resulted in a 66% reduction in renal fibrosis at 28 days (p<0.001). IRI also led to a significant increase in serum creatinine acutely, which was attenuated by IPC (p<0.0001). Interestingly at 14-days, there was limited histological damage and differentiation between IRI and IPC kidneys was difficult.\n\nIPC can protect from both acute and chronic kidney damage. 14-days post IRI represents a transitional phase, which maybe a timepoint for commitment to either fibrosis or recovery, and hence offers potential for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "With the increased demand of large-cohort proteomic analysis, fast and reproducible sample preparation has become the critical issue that needs to be solved. Herein, we developed a fully automated and integrated proteomics sample preparation workflow (autoSISPROT), enabling the simultaneous processing of 96 samples in less than 2.5 hours. Benefiting from its 96-channel all-in-tip operation, protein digestion, peptide desalting, and TMT labeling could be achieved in a fully automated manner. The autoSISPROT demonstrated good sample preparation performances, including >94% of digestion efficiency, nearly 100% of alkylation efficiency, >98% of TMT labeling efficiency, and >0.9 of intra- and inter-batch Pearson correlation coefficients. Furthermore, by combining with cellular thermal shift assay-coupled to mass spectrometry (CETSA-MS), the autoSISPROT was able to process and TMT-label 40 samples automatically and accurately identify the known target of methotrexate. Importantly, taking advantage of the data independent acquisition and isothermal CETSA-MS, the autoSISPROT was well applied for identifying known targets and potential off-targets of 20 kinase inhibitors by automatedly processing 87 samples, affording over a 10-fold improvement in throughput when compared to classical CETSA-MS. Collectively, we developed a fully automated and integrated workflow for high-throughput proteomics sample preparation and drug target identification.",
