    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWSeveral methods of ecological network inference have been proposed, but their consistency and applicability for use across ecologically relevant scales require further investigation. Here, we infer ecological networks using two data sets (YFDP, FIA) describing distributional and attribute information at local, regional, and continental scales for woody species across North America. We accomplish this inference using four different methodologies (COOCCUR, NETASSOC, HMSC, NDD-RIM), incorporating biological data along an occurrence-performance spectrum while accounting (or not) for various confounding parameters. We contrast 1-1 associations at each evaluated scale to quantify consistency amongst inference approaches. We also assess consistency across scales within each inference approach. Ultimately, we find that inferred networks are inconsistent across scales and methodologies, particularly at continental scales. We highlight how such inconsistencies between network inference methods may be linked to using occurrence or performance information and incorporating or not confounding factors. Finally, we argue that identifying the \"best\" inference method is non-trivial. Thus, to facilitate the choice of inference methods for a given purpose, we suggest aligning specific research questions and the scale applicability of the method when interpreting the inferred links, network topology, and ecological processes governing network assembly.",

    "abstract": "Rational scale-up strategies to accelerate bioprocess development, require sound knowledge of cellular behaviour under industrial conditions. In this study, the strictly aerobic yeast Yarrowia lipolytica is exposed to repeated oxygen limitations, approximated from a large-scale cultivation. A data-driven multi-omics strategy is deployed to elucidate its transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolic response. Throughout a single perturbation, metabolite and protein levels showed dynamic profiles while they returned to steady state values when aerobic conditions were restored. After repeated oscillations, significant cellular rearrangements were found, with a special focus on central carbon metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, lipid, and amino acid biosynthesis. Most notably, metabolite levels as well as the catabolic reduction charge are maintained at higher concentrations. Moreover, proteins involved in NADPH-consuming anabolic pathways showed an increased abundance, which is suggested to be compensated for through an increased pentose-phosphate pathway activity. Although dynamics were found on all three omics levels, the proteomic and metabolic changes were in most instances not supported by strong transcriptional changes. Thus, this work suggests that the response of Y. lipolytica to (repeated) oxygen oscillations is strongly regulated by post-transcriptional mechanisms. These findings provide novel insights into potential cellular regulation on an industrial scale, thereby facilitating a more efficient bioprocess development through mitigating any undesired behaviour.\n\nKey points- Dynamic response of Yarrowia lipolytica to industrial oxygen profiles.\n- New metabolic steady states are found after exposure to repeated oxygen oscillations.\n- A multi-omics strategy elucidates the importance of post-transcriptional mechanisms.",

To challenge this notion, we used the excellent temporal resolution of magnetoencephalography (MEG) to record the whole-brain activity of 39 older adults (over 60 years old) and 37 young adults (aged 18-25 years) during recognition of previously memorised and novel musical sequences. Our results demonstrate that independent of behavioural measures, older compared to young adults showed increased rapid auditory cortex responses (around 100 and 250 ms after each tone of the sequence) and decreased later responses (around 250 and 350 ms) in hippocampus, ventromedial prefrontal cortex and inferior frontal gyrus. Working memory abilities were associated with stronger brain activity for both young and older adults. Our findings unpick the complexity of the healthy aging brain, showing age-related neural transformations in predictive and memory processes and challenging simplistic notions that non-pathological aging merely diminishes neural predictive capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Activation of opioid receptors in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) mediates aspects of analgesia induced by both exogenous and endogenous opioids. We have previously shown that opioid signaling disrupts both afferent excitatory and indirect inhibitory synaptic transmission from the medial thalamus (MThal) to the ACC, but the effects of endogenous opioids within this circuit remain poorly understood. The goal of the current study was to understand how the endogenous opioid, [Met]5-enkephalin (ME), modulates thalamic-driven excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission onto layer V pyramidal neurons in the ACC. We used pharmacology, brain slice electrophysiology and optogenetic stimulation to study opioid-mediated modulation of optically evoked glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission. The results revealed that ME inhibited both AMPA-mediated excitatory and GABA-mediated inhibitory synaptic transmission in the ACC. However, inhibitory transmission was more potently inhibited than excitatory transmission by ME. This preferential reduction in GABAA-mediated synaptic transmission was primarily due to the activation of delta opioid receptors by ME and resulted in a net disinhibition of MThal-ACC excitatory pathway. These results suggest that moderate concentrations of ME can lead to net excitation of ACC circuitry and that analgesia may be associated with disinhibition rather than inhibition of ACC subcircuits.",

    "abstract": "1.Powassan virus (POWV) is an emergent tick-borne encephalitis virus of Lyme disease endemic sites in North America. Due to range expansion and local intensification of deer tick vector (Ixodes scapularis) populations in the northeastern and upper midwestern U.S., encephalitis cases are increasingly being reported. A better understanding of the transmission cycle of POWV may allow for predicting the eventual public health burden. Recent phylogeographic analyses of POWV have identified geographical structuring, with well-defined northeastern and midwestern clades of the deer tick virus subtype (lineage II); sublineages exist within each clade. It may be that the local sublineages differ in their capacity to be transmitted by the deer tick vector. Accordingly, we determined whether there are strain-dependent differences in transmission. Five recent, low passage POWV isolates were used to measure aspects of vector competence, using viremic and artificial infection methods. Infection rates in experimental ticks remained consistent between all five isolates tested, resulting in 12-20% infection rate and no clear differences in viral load. We conclude that there is a genotype independent ability of POWV to infect deer ticks, and that differences in transmission efficiency are not likely to serve as the basis for regional differences in apparent public health burden.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria utilize various strategies to prevent internal dehydration during hypertonic stress. A common approach to countering the effects of the stress is to import compatible solutes such as glycine betaine, leading to simultaneous passive water fluxes following the osmotic gradient. OpuA from Lactococcus lactis is a type I ABC-importer that uses two substrate-binding domains (SBDs) to capture extracellular glycine betaine and deliver the substrate to the transmembrane domains for subsequent transport. OpuA senses osmotic stress via changes in the internal ionic strength and is furthermore regulated by the 2nd messenger cyclic-di-AMP. We now show, by means of solution-based single-molecule FRET and analysis with multi- parameter photon-by-photon hidden Markov modeling, that the SBDs interact in an ionic strength-dependent manner. The smFRET data are in accordance with the apparent cooperativity in transport and supported by new cryo-EM data of OpuA. We propose that physical interactions between SBDs and cooperativity in substrate delivery could be more widespread than recognized thus far.",

    "abstract": "Acoustic telemetry provides valuable insights into behavioural patterns of aquatic animals such as downstream migrating European eels (Anguilla anguilla). The behaviour of silver eels during the migration is known to be influenced by environmental factors, yet so is the performance of acoustic telemetry networks. This study focusses on quantifying the impact of these environmental factors on both, migration behaviour and receiver performance, in order to determine possible limiting conditions for detecting tagged eels in tidal riverine areas and estuaries. A dominance analysis of the selected models describing migration speed, activity and receiver performance was conducted following 234 silver eels that were tagged with acoustic transmitters and observed by a receiver network in the Ems River during two subsequent migration seasons. The results suggest a passive locomotion of silver eels during their downstream migration by taking advantage of selective tidal stream transport (STST) It is further shown that water temperature, salinity, turbidity, precipitation, and especially current velocity were major parameters influencing migration activity and speed. At the same time, analyses of the detection probability of tagged eels under varying environmental conditions indicated a decreased receiver performance during high current velocities, resulting in a coincidence of high migration activity and reduced detection probability. Correspondingly, there is a risk that particularly during phases of increased activity, due to limited telemetry performance, not all fish will be detected, resulting in an underestimation of migration activity. To avoid misleading interpretations and underestimates of migration numbers of eels and other migratory fish using STST, this study highlights the need to conduct range tests and adjust the receiver placement in areas and conditions of high current velocities.",

    "abstract": "While many terrestrial animals use celestial and terrestrial cues for orientation, subterranean animals lack access to these cues. The geomagnetic field serves as a reliable alternative cue for underground navigation. Subterranean mammals use the geomagnetic field to burrow and navigate within their nests; however, whether subterranean insects possess magnetoreception remains unclear. Here, we investigated the influence of magnetic fields on burrowing directions in subterranean mole crickets (Gryllotalpa orientalis). Under an intact magnetic field, mole crickets predominantly burrow in the north-south direction. However, when the magnetic field was rotated by 90{degrees}, the preferred burrowing direction shifted to the east-west axis. Notably, when the horizontal component of the geomagnetic field was reduced to near 0 {micro}T, no preferred direction was observed. These results suggest that mole crickets have a magnetic sense and they align the direction at the beginning of burrowing. The study enhances our comprehension of underground orientation mechanisms in subterranean insects and reveals convergent evolution between insects and mammals in utilizing the geomagnetic field as a navigational cue.",

We first show that the Phyper-spank promoter from Bacillus subtilis is functional in L. gasseri, albeit with substantial leakage. We then construct and screen a semi-rational library of Phyper-spank variants to select a set of four IPTG-inducible promoters that span a range of expression levels and exhibit reduced leakages and operational dynamic ranges (from ca. 9 to 28 fold-change).

    "abstract": "Plasmodium falciparum is the deadliest causative agent of human malaria. This parasite has historically developed resistance to many drugs, including the current frontline treatments, so new therapeutic targets are needed. Our previous work on guanine quadruplexes (G4s) in the parasites DNA and RNA has highlighted their influence on parasite biology, and revealed G4 stabilising compounds as promising candidates for drug repositioning. In particular, quarfloxin, a former anticancer agent, kills blood-stage parasites at all developmental stages, with fast rates of kill and nanomolar potency. Here we explored the molecular mechanism of quarfloxin and its related derivative CX-5461. In vitro, both compounds bound to P. falciparum-encoded G4 sequences. In cellulo, quarfloxin was more potent than CX-5461, and could prevent establishment of blood-stage malaria in vivo in a murine model. CX-5461 showed clear DNA damaging activity, as reported in human cells, while quarfloxin caused weaker signatures of DNA damage. Both compounds caused transcriptional dysregulation in the parasite, but the affected genes were largely different, again suggesting different modes of action. Therefore, CX-5461 may act primarily as a DNA damaging agent in both Plasmodium parasites and mammalian cells, whereas the complete antimalarial mode of action of quarfloxin may be parasite-specific and remains somewhat elusive.",

While the need to control these factors is recognized, the relative effect on microbial community of duration at room temperature, time of day, and hindgut position, in the context of a known biological variable, is unclear. To answer these questions, and assess reproducibility of results across different microbiome compositions, parallel experiments were performed to investigate the effect of those factors on the microbiome of age- and sex-matched isogenic mice colonized with two different vendor-origin microbiomes.\n\nResults16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data from flash-frozen fecal samples showed no statistical difference in alpha or beta diversity compared to samples incubated for 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9 hours at room temperature. Overall, samples collected in the AM period showed greater richness and alpha-diversity compared to samples collected in the PM period. While a significant effect of time was detected in all hindgut regions, the effect increased from cecum to distal colon. When using two vendor-origin microbiomes as a biological variable, its effect size vastly outweighed the effect size of the time samples spent at room temperature, the time of day samples were collected, and the position within the colon from which samples were collected.\n\nConclusionsThis study has highlighted multiple scenarios encountered in microbiome research that may affect outcome measures of microbial diversity and composition. Unexpectedly, delayed time to sample cold storage up to nine hours did not affect the alpha or global beta diversity of fecal sample. We then presented evidence of location- and time-dependent effects within the hindgut on microbial richness, diversity, and composition. We finally demonstrated a relatively low effect size of these technical factors when compared to a primary experimental factor with large intergroup variability.",

    "abstract": "The replisome, a large multi-subunit assembly, carries out the process of chromosome replication, connecting the unwrapping of the parental DNA with the creation of new daughter strands. In Escherichia coli, it is debated whether the two replisomes move independently along the two chromosome arms during replication or if they remain in close proximity, with the DNA being pulled toward the replisomes as replication progresses. Here, we use fluorescence microscopy to determine the location and diffusivity of the replisome and various chromosomal loci throughout the cell cycle of the model organism E. coli. We find that (i) the two replisomes are confined to a region of 250 nm and 120 nm along the cell long and short axis respectively, and the chromosomal loci move through this region sequentially based on distance from the origin of replication. (ii) When a locus is being replicated, its diffusivity slows down. (iii) There is no indication that replication initiation occurs close to the cell membrane as has been proposed in a few previous studies. In conclusion, our data supports a model with DNA moving towards stationary replisomes at replication.",

    "abstract": "Photosynthesis (PS) in Purple Non-Sulphur Bacteria (PNSB) is strictly controlled to avoid energy consumption and to prevent oxidative stress when oxygen is present. PpsR, a transcriptional repressor codified in the Photosynthetic Gene Cluster (PGC), is one of the main players in the regulation of PS related genes. In some cases, PpsR do not sense the environmental cue by itself but delegates this task to another protein like PpaA/AerR anti-repressors, which can ultimately affect PpsR affinity to some promoter regions. In this work, the effects of locus Rru_A0625 product (HP1) on PS regulation of Rhodospirillum rubrum, were studied by mutation/complementation and transcriptomic strategies. Rru_A0625 is located next to ppsR gene, just like other PpaA/AerR members, and its deletion annuls pigment synthesis in dark micro/anaerobic growth conditions. HP1 shows similarity to PpaA/AerR anti-repressors family, although it does not possess their typical cobalamin binding domain. A transcriptomic analysis of Rru_A0625 deletion mutant showed that HP1 not only has effects on bacterioclorophyll and carotenoid biosynthesis, but also many other biological processes in the cell. The most notorious is the impact on the transcription of the nitrogenase complex components and some accessory proteins. Our results suggest that this new member of the PpaA/AerR family has evolved losing the canonical cobalamin binding domain, but not the redox sensing capability, conserving a not fully understood mechanism of PS regulation.\n\nIMPORTANCERhodospirillum rubrum vast metabolic versatility places it as a remarkable model bacterium and an excellent biotechnological chassis. The key component of PS studied in this work (HP1) stands out among the other members of PpaA/AerR anti-repressors family since it lacks the most conserved motif they all share: the cobalamin B-12 binding motif. Even with a minimized and barely recognizable aminoacidic sequence, HP1 stills controls PS as the other members of the family, allowing a fast response to changes in the redox state of the cell. This work also shows that HP1 absence affects genes form relevant biological processes other than PS, including nitrogen fixation and stress response. From a biotechnological perspective, HP1 could be manipulated in approaches where PS is not necessary, such hydrogen or polyhydroxyalkanoates production, to suppress unnecessary energy burden.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of ophidiomycosis (or snake fungal disease) in snakes has prompted increased awareness of the potential effects of fungal infections on wild reptile populations. Yet, aside from Ophidiomyces ophidiicola, little is known about other mycoses affecting wild reptiles. The closely related genus Paranannizziopsis has been associated with dermatomycosis in snakes and tuataras in captive collections, and P. australasiensis was recently identified as the cause of skin infections in non-native wild panther chameleons (Furcifer pardalis) in Florida, USA. Here we describe five cases of Paranannizziopsis spp. associated with skin lesions in wild snakes in North America and one additional case from a captive snake from Connecticut, USA. In addition to demonstrating that wild Nearctic snakes can serve as a host for these fungi, we also provide evidence that the genus Paranannizziopsis is widespread in wild snakes, with cases being identified in Louisiana (USA), Minnesota (USA), Virginia (USA), and British Columbia (Canada). Phylogenetic analyses conducted on multiple loci of the fungal strains we isolated identified P. australasiensis in Louisiana and Virginia; the remaining strains from Minnesota and British Columbia did not cluster with any of the described species of Paranannizziopsis, although the strains from British Columbia appear to represent a single lineage. Finally, we designed a pan-Paranannizziopsis real-time PCR assay targeting the internal transcribed spacer region 2. This assay successfully detected DNA of all described species of Paranannizziopsis and the two potentially novel taxa isolated in this study and did not cross-react with closely related fungi or other fungi commonly found on the skin of snakes. The assay was 100% sensitive and specific when screening clinical (skin tissue or skin swab) samples, although full determination of the assays performance will require additional follow up due to the small number of clinical samples (n=14 from 11 snakes) available for testing in our study. Nonetheless, the PCR assay can provide an important tool in further investigating the prevalence, distribution, and host range of Paranannizziopsis spp. and facilitate more rapid diagnosis of Paranannizziopsis spp. infections that are otherwise difficult to differentiate from other dermatomycoses.",

    "abstract": "Bacteroidota are abundant members of the human gut microbiota that shape the enteric landscape by modulating host immunity and degrading dietary- and host-derived glycans. These processes are at least partially mediated by Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs). In this work, we developed a high-throughput screen to identify genes required for OMV biogenesis and its regulation in Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bt). Our screening led us to the identification of a novel family of Dual Membrane-spanning Anti-sigma factors (Dma), which regulate OMV biogenesis in Bt. We employed molecular and multiomic analyses to demonstrate that deletion of Dma1, the founding member of the Dma family, results in hypervesiculation by modulating the expression of NigD1, which belongs to a family of uncharacterized proteins found throughout Bacteroidota. Dma1 has an unprecedented domain organization: it contains a C-terminal {beta}-barrel embedded in the OM; its N-terminal domain interacts with its cognate sigma factor in the cytoplasm, and both domains are tethered via an intrinsically disordered region that traverses the periplasm. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that the Dma family is a unique feature of Bacteroidota. This study provides the first mechanistic insights into the regulation of OMV biogenesis in human gut bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the functional profiles of cultivable bacterial communities is crucial for comprehending their ecological significance in marine environments. This study investigates the functional profiles of cultivable bacterial communities in the water and sediments during the productive, southwest monsoon season, along the west coast of India. The southwest monsoon plays a vital role in shaping the hydrological and biogeochemical characteristics of this region, making it an ideal period to study bacterial communities and their functions. Our study utilizes a cultivation techniques to study taxonomy as well as functional assays to elucidate the diverse organic substrates utilization capabilities of bacterial communities. Cultivable bacteria were isolated from discrete water depths and sediment samples from the coastal and off-shore region. Subsequently the carbohydrase, lipase and protease assays were performed to assess its functional potential. The results of this study reveal a rich diversity of cultivable bacterial communities including, representative from Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacterial phylum with diverse functional profiles. The functional analyses provide insights into the metabolic capabilities of the bacteria, including organic substrates degradation, processes. The bacterial taxonomic diversity and enzymes activities were significantly different (p < 0.001) among the water and sediment bacterial morphotypes. In conclusion, this research sheds light on the functional profiles of cultivable bacterial communities in the water and sediments along the west coast of India during the productive southwest monsoon season. The comprehensive analysis of their functional capabilities provides insights into their ecological roles and potential significance in organic matter recycling. These findings contribute to our understanding of microbial diversity and ecosystem functioning in coastal environments and lay the groundwork for further research on harnessing the significance of these bacteria in biogeochemical cycling.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the interaction between environmental conditions, crop yields, and soil health is crucial for sustainable agriculture in a changing climate. Management practices to limit disease are a balancing act. For example, in potato production, dry conditions favour common scab (Streptomyces spp.) and wet conditions favour blackleg disease (Pectobacterium spp.). The exact mechanisms involved and how these link to changes in the soil microbiome is unclear. Our objectives were to test how irrigation management and bacterial pathogen load in potato seed stocks impact: i) crop yields; ii) disease development (blackleg/common scab); and iii) soil microbial community dynamics. We used stocks of seed potatoes with varying Pectobacterium levels (Jelly [high load], Jelly [low load], and Estima [Zero - no Pectobacterium]). Stocks were grown under four irrigation regimes that differed in the timing and level of watering. The soil microbial communities were profiled using amplicon sequencing at 50% plant emergence and harvest and advanced bioinformatic analyses were used to correlate microbes to treatments and disease symptoms. Irrigation increased blackleg symptoms in the plots planted with stocks with low and high levels of Pectobacterium (22-34%) but not in the zero stock (2-6%). Not irrigating increased common scab symptoms (2-5%) and reduced crop yields. Irrigation did not impact the composition of the soil microbiome, but planting stock with a high Pectobacterium burden resulted in an increased abundance of Planctomycetota, Anaerolinea, and Acidobacteria species within the microbiome. Ensemble quotient analysis highlighted Anaerolinea as highly associated with blackleg symptoms in the field. We conclude that Pectobacterium pathogen load within seed stocks could have more substantial effects on soil communities than irrigation regimes.",

    "abstract": "Structured Abstract PurposeLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) show promise in their ability to introduce mRNA to drive protein expression in specific cell types of the mammalian eye. Here, we examined the ability of mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) with two distinct formulations to drive gene expression in mouse and human retina and other ocular tissues.\n\nMethodsWe introduced mRNA carrying LNPs into two biological systems. Intravitreal injections were tested to deliver LNPs into the mouse eye. Human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and retinal explants were used to assess mRNA expression in human tissue. We analyzed specificity of expression using histology, immunofluorescence, and imaging.\n\nResultsIn mice, mRNAs encoding GFP and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) were specifically expressed by Muller glia and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Acute inflammatory changes measured by microglia distribution (Iba-1) or interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression were not observed 6 hours post-injection. Human RPE also expressed high levels of GFP. Human retinal explants expressed GFP in cells with apical and basal processes consistent with Muller glia and in perivascular cells consistent with macrophages.\n\nConclusionsWe demonstrated the ability to reliably transfect subpopulations of retinal cells in mice eye tissues in vivo and in human ocular tissues. Of significance, intravitreal injections were sufficient to transfect the RPE in mice. To our knowledge we demonstrate delivery of mRNA using LNPs in human ocular tissues for the first time.\n\nTranslational RelevanceOcular gene-replacement therapies using non-viral vector methods are of interest as alternatives to adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. Our studies show that mRNA LNP delivery can be used to transfect retinal cells in both mouse and human tissues without inducing significant inflammation. This promising methodology could be used to transfect retinal cell lines, tissue explants, mice, or potentially as gene-replacement therapy in a clinical setting in the future.",

    "abstract": "The TATA-box binding protein (TBP) is the sole transcription factor common in the initiation complexes of the three major eukaryotic RNA Polymerases (Pol I, II, and III). Decades of research have shown that TBP is essential for proper transcription by the three RNA Pols, though the emergence of TBP paralogs throughout evolution have expanded the complexity in RNA Pol initiation. We have previously shown that acute TBP depletion in mouse embryonic stem cells led to a global decrease in Pol III activity, consistent with the requirement of TBP in Pol III inititation. In contrast, Pol II transcription remained unaffected in the absence of TBP and its paralogs. In this report, we show that, in contrast to Pol II-transcribed genes, the TBP paralog TRF2 does not bind to Pol I promoters, and therefore cannot functionally replace TBP upon depletion. Importantly, acute TBP depletion has no major effect on Pol I occupancy or activity on ribosomal RNA genes, but TBP binding in mitosis leads to efficient Pol I reactivation following cell division. These findings provide a more nuanced role for TBP in Pol I transcription in murine embryonic stem cells.\n\nSignificanceThe TATA-box binding protein (TBP) is a highly conserved and essential protein in eukaryotes. Decades of in vitro and yeast research have established its role in the initiation of the three main eukaryotic RNA polymerases. However, the ability to rapidly deplete proteins in vivo is revealing more nuance in the function of TBP in mammalian cells. Using this technology, we reassess the role of TBP in RNA Polymerase I (Pol I) transcription in mouse embryonic stem cells. We find that neither TBP nor its paralog TRF2 are required for Pol I recruitment or activity, but TBP binding during mitosis promotes efficient reactivation after cell division. Overall, these findings provide new evidence into the complex function of TBP in eukaryotic transcription.",

Therefore, molecules that modulate CRYs have the potential to regulate gluconeogenesis. In this study, we discovered a new molecule called TW68 that interacts with the primary pockets of mammalian CRY1/2, leading to reduced ubiquitination levels and increased stability. In cell-based circadian rhythm assays using U2OS:Bmal1-dLuc cells, TW68 extended the period length of the circadian rhythm. Additionally, TW68 decreased the transcriptional levels of two genes, Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PCK1) and Glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC), which play crucial roles in glucose biosynthesis during glucagon-induced gluconeogenesis in HepG2 cells. Oral administration of TW68 in mice showed good tolerance, a good pharmacokinetic profile, and remarkable bioavailability. Finally, when administered to fasting ob/ob and fat-induced diabetic animals, TW68 reduced blood glucose levels by enhancing CRY stabilization and subsequently decreasing the transcriptional levels of Pck1 and G6pc. These findings collectively demonstrate the antidiabetic efficacy of TW68 in vivo, suggesting its therapeutic potential for controlling fasting glucose levels in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

    "abstract": "The number of people suffering from scrub typhus, which is not of concern, is increasing year by year, especially in Yunnan Province, China. From June 1, 2021 to August 15, 2022, a total of 505 mammalian samples were collected from farm, forest, and residential habitats with high incidence of scrub typhus in Yunnan, China, for nPCR (nested PCR) and qPCR (quantitative real-time PCR) detection of Orientia tsutsugamushi. A total of 4 orders of murine-like animals, Rodentia (87.52%, n=442), Insectivora (10.29%, n=52), Lagomorpha (1.79%, n=9) and Scandentia (0.40%, n=2) were trapped. Comparing the qPCR infection rates in the three habitats, it was no significant difference that the infection rate of residential habitat (44.44%) and that of the farm habitat (45.05%, P>0.05), which is much larger than that of the forest habitat (3.08%) (P<0.001). Three genotypes (Karp, Kato and TA763) of O. tsutsugamushi were found from Yunnan, China in this study. We found a tendency for scrub typhus to migrate from forests to residential habitats.\n\nAuthor SummaryScrub typhus is acute febrile infectious disease caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi that threatens nearly 1 billion people. According to the data we have obtained, the incidence rate of infected people has reached 23.84/100,000 population until December 2022 in Yunnan, China. The incidence rate has increased non-negligibly Compared with 0.65/100,000 population in 2006. Among them, the incidence rate has increased by 71.14% from 2019 to 2022. Scrub typhus is transmitted by the bite of chigger larvae with murine-like animals as the main source of infection Rodentia are the most important reservoir hosts, followed by Insectivora. Therefore, in view of the influencing factor of human habitat, we used qPCR (quantitative real-time PCR) and nPCR (nested PCR) techniques to analyze the prevalence of O. tsutsugamushi in hosts of different human habitats from June 2021 to August 2022. Our research shows that the diversity of O. tsutsugamushi genotypes in Yunnan Province provides guidance for the prevention and Control of scrub typhus. And it was found that the infection rate of O. tsutsugamushi in murine-like animals is quite different in different human habitats, especially the high infection rate in residential habitat and farm habitat, suggesting that O. tsutsugamushi can be infected without wilderness history.",

Here, we discovered spermatocyte (SP) differentiated to round spermatid (RS) had equal regulation extent which may related to ribosomal behavior alteration. The change of ribosome occupancy was related to SP and RS specific function in spermatogenesis. Interactome of functional ribosome in SP and RS revealed the activated ribosome in SP but stalled and nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) associated ribosome in RS. Functional ribosomes of RS occupied 5untranslated regions (5UTR) of SP specific transcripts and correlated its RNA and protein downregulation. These findings suggested a branched NMD pathway was activated in RS to eliminate SP specific transcripts and keep them from being translated.

    "abstract": "The analysis of chromatin features in single cells centers around Tn5 transposase and exploits its activity to simultaneously fragment target DNA and integrate adapter sequences of choice. This reaction provides a direct readout in the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin in single cells (scATAC-seq) to map open chromatin regions. However, a current limitation is the sparse coverage of open chromatin loci that are detected in a given single cell by droplet-based methods. Thus, enhancing Tn5 activity to improve genomic coverage of scATAC-seq or facilitating multi-omics readouts of chromatin features via Tn5 together with the transcriptome is of great interest. Here, we address these issues by optimizing scATAC-seq for an increased number of integrations per cell. In addition, we provide a protocol that combines mapping of histone modification with scRNA-seq from the same cell by targeting Tn5 to antibody-bound chromatin epitopes. Our experimental workflows improve the results obtained from the downstream data analysis and serve to better resolve epigenetic heterogeneity and transcription regulation in single cells.",

    "abstract": "Animal development relies on complex gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that govern the nearly irreversible changes that occur during cell differentiation. In this work we aimed to determine key transcription factors (TFs) associated with the dissolution of the naive pluripotent state and the acquisition of a formative identity. We identified OCT6 as one of the earliest TFs induced during the onset of mouse embryonic stem cell (mESCs) differentiation. To investigate its role, we generated an Oct6 knockout mESC line, which failed to acquire the characteristic cell morphology associated with the formative state. Transcriptome analysis of differentiating cells revealed nearly 300 differentially expressed genes compared to wild-type cells, including pluripotency TFs Nanog, Klf2, Nr5a2, Prdm14, and Esrrb, that failed to correctly downregulate. Notably, premature expression of OCT6 in naive cells triggered a rapid morphological transformation mirroring differentiation, accompanied by self-induction of Oct6 and expression of TFs such as Sox3, Zic2/3, Foxp1, as well as the formative genes Dnmt3A and FGF5. Strikingly, the majority of OCT6 expressing cells did not express NANOG. Gene expression and single molecule RNA-FISH analysis confirmed that this regulation was at the transcriptional level. Collectively, our results establish OCT6 as a key TF in the dissolution of the naive pluripotent state and support a model where Oct6 and Nanog form a double negative feedback loop which could act as a toggle switch important for the transition to the formative state.\n\nHighlightsO_LIOct6 is rapidly induced as mESCs exit ground state pluripotency.\nC_LIO_LILoss of OCT6 negatively affects the transition to formative pluripotency.\nC_LIO_LIPremature expression of OCT6 in mESCs is sufficient to induce a formative-like phenotype.\nC_LIO_LIOCT6 and NANOG repress each other forming a double negative feedback loop.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) colonizes humans asymptomatically but can also cause opportunistic infections, ranging from mild skin infections to severe life-threatening conditions. Resistance and tolerance are two ways a host can survive an infection. Resistance is limiting the pathogen burden, while tolerance is limiting the health impact of a given pathogen burden. In previous work, we established that collaborative cross (CC) mouse line CC061 is highly susceptible to Methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection (MRSA, USA300), while CC024 is tolerant. To identify host genes involved in tolerance after S. aureus infection, we crossed CC061 mice and CC024 mice to generate F1 and F2 populations. Survival after MRSA infection in the F1 and F2 generations was 65% and 45% and followed a complex dominant-recessive inheritance pattern. Colonization in F2 animals was more extreme than in their parents, suggesting successful segregation of genetic factors. We identified a QTL peak on chromosome 7 for survival and weight change after infection. In this QTL, the WSB allele was present in CC024 mice and contributed to their MRSA tolerant phenotype. Two genes, C5ar1 and C5ar2, have high-impact variants in this region. The complement factor, C5a, is an anaphylatoxin that can trigger a massive immune response by binding to its receptors, C5ar1 and C5ar2. We hypothesize that C5a may have altered binding to variant receptors in CC024 mice, reducing damage caused by the cytokine storm and resulting in the ability to tolerate a higher pathogen burden and longer survival.\n\nImportanceStaphylococcus aureus causes a wide range of diseases in humans. Resistance and tolerance are two ways a host can survive an infection. Resistance is limiting the pathogen burden, while tolerance is limiting the health impact of a given pathogen burden. Tolerance mechanisms are poorly understood in context of host-pathogen interaction. To identify host genes involved in tolerance after S. aureus infection, we crossed CC061 mice and CC024 mice. The genetic factors controlling tolerance were well segregated in the F2 population. Using QTL mapping, we identified a significant peak on chromosome 7 for survival and weight change after infection. Two genes, C5ar1 and C5ar2, have high-impact variants in this region.

    "abstract": "Molecular mechanisms behind the reprogramming of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) remain poorly understood. While dynamic changes in gene expression are considered to drive reprogramming, the contribution of individual alleles of genes to reprogramming remains unexplored. It is thought that two alleles of a gene can transcribe independently or coordinatedly, which in turn can lead to temporal expression heterogeneity with potentially distinct impacts on cell fate. Here, we profiled genome-wide transcriptional burst kinetics with an allelic resolution during the reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) to iPSC. We show that many genes involved in iPSC reprogramming pathways exhibit bursty expression and contribute to dynamic autosomal random monoallelic expression (aRME). Moreover, we find that the degree of coordination of allelic bursting differs among genes and changes dynamically during iPSC reprogramming. Importantly, we show that alleles of many reprogramming-related genes burst in a highly coordinated fashion. ATAC-seq analysis revealed that coordination of allelic bursting is linked to allelic chromatin accessibility. Consistently, we show that highly coordinated genes are enriched with chromatin accessibility regulators such as H3K36me3, H3K27ac, histone variant H3.3 and BRD4. Collectively, our study demonstrates that chromatin states contribute to coordinated allelic bursting to fine-tune the expression of genes involved in iPSC reprogramming and provides insights into the implications of allelic bursting coordination in cell fate specification.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=195 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/548864v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (45K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@162ec20org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17c2db0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19b9d59org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1775052_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Aggregation of leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT2) causes ALECT2, a systemic amyloidosis that affects the kidney and liver. Homozygosity of the I40V LECT2 mutation is believed to be necessary but not sufficient for the disease. Previous studies established that LECT2 fibrillogenesis is greatly accelerated by loss of its single bound zinc ion and stirring or shaking. These forms of agitation are often used to facilitate protein aggregation, but they create heterogeneous shear conditions, including air-liquid interfaces that denature proteins, that are not present in the body. Here, we determined the extent to which a more physiological form of mechanical stress--shear generated by fluid flow through a network of artery and capillary-sized channels--drives LECT2 fibrillogenesis. To mimic blood flow through the human kidney, where LECT2 and other proteins form amyloid deposits, we developed a microfluidic device consisting of progressively branched channels narrowing from 5 mm to 20 m in width. Flow shear was particularly pronounced at the branch points and in the smallest capillaries, and this induced LECT2 aggregation much more efficiently than conventional shaking methods. EM images suggested the resulting fibril structures were different in the two conditions. Importantly, results from the microfluidic device showed the first evidence that the I40V mutation accelerated fibril formation and increased both size and density of the aggregates. These findings suggest that kidney-like flow shear, in combination with zinc loss, acts in combination with the I40V mutation to trigger LECT2 amyloidogenesis. These microfluidic devices may be of general use for uncovering the mechanisms by which blood flow induces misfolding and amyloidosis of circulating proteins.",

    "abstract": "Disulfide bond is important for maintaining the structural conformation and stability of the protein. Introducing new disulfide bond is a promising strategy for rational protein design. In this report, disulfide bond engineering has been applied to improve the stability of an industrially important enzyme, Glycoside Hydrolase family GH 7 cellobiohydrolase (GH7 CBHs) or Cel7A of A fumigatus origin. Disulfide by Design 2.0 (DbD2), an online tool, was used for the detection of the mutation sites and created four mutations (D276C-G279C; DSB1, D322C-G327C; DSB2, T416C-I432C; DSB3, G460C-S465C; DSB4) both inside and outside of the peripheral loops but, not in the catalytic region. The disulfide bond formed between the A2 and A4 loop of DSB3 showed higher thermostability (70% activity at 700C), higher substrate affinity (Km= 0.081mM) and higher catalytic activity (Kcat =9.75 min-1; Kcat/Km = 120.37 mM min-1) compared to wild type AfCel7A (50% activity at 700C; Km= 0.128mM; Kcat = 4.833 min-1; Kcat/Km = 37.75 mM min -1). The other three mutants with high B factor showed loss of thermostability and catalytic activity. Molecular dynamic simulations revealed that the mutation T416C-I432C makes the tunnel wider (DSB3:13.6 [A]; Wt: 5.3 [A]) at the product exit site; giving flexibility in the entrance region and mobility of the substrate. It may facilitate substrate entry into the catalytic tunnel and releases the product faster than the wild type. Whereas in other mutants, the tunnel is not prominent (DSB4), the exit is lost (DSB1), and the ligand binding site is absent (DSB2). This is the first report of the gain of function of both thermostability and enzyme activity of cellobiohydrolase Cel7A by disulfide bond engineering in the loop.\n\nImportanceCellulases are important for their role in the production of bioethanol, the cleanest renewable replacement of fossil fuels. Engineering of the cellulases is a chalange to increase their catalytic activity and thermostability for production of cheap ethanol. In this report we have introduced disulfide bond and successfully increased the both thermostabilty and catalytic activity of AfCel7A.",

    "abstract": "Current cancer immunotherapy (e.g., immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)) has only benefited a small subset of patients. Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) activation holds the potential to improve cancer immunotherapy by eliciting type-I interferon (IFN-I) responses in cancer cells and myeloid cells. Yet, current approaches to this end, mostly by targeting STING, have marginal clinical therapeutic efficacy. Here, we report a cGAS-specific agonistic oligonucleotide, Svg3, as a novel approach to cGAS-STING activation for versatile cancer immunotherapy. Featured with a hairpin structure with consecutive guanosines flanking the stem, Svg3 binds to cGAS and enhances cGAS-Svg3 phase separation to form liquid-like droplets. This results in cGAS activation by Svg3 for robust and dose-dependent IFN-I responses, which outperforms several state-of-the-art STING agonists in murine and human immune cells, and human tumor tissues. Nanocarriers efficiently delivers Svg3 to tissues, cells, and cytosol where cGAS is located. Svg3 reduces tumor immunosuppression and potentiates ICB therapeutic efficacy of multiple syngeneic tumors, in wildtype but neither cGas-/- nor goldenticket Sting-/- mice. Further, as an immunostimulant adjuvant, Svg3 enhances the immunogenicity of peptide antigens to elicit potent T cell responses for robust ICB combination immunotherapy of tumors. Overall, cGAS-agonistic Svg3 is promising for versatile cancer combination immunotherapy.",

Using fluorescence lifetime detection of FRET between RyR-bound FKBP and CaM, we resolved different structural states of CaM and Ca-driven shifts in the conformation of CaM bound to RyR. We found that CaM becomes more compact in contracting high-Ca2+ vs. relaxing low-Ca2+. Skeletal and cardiac RyR isoforms show different CaM-RyR conformations, and binding and structural kinetics reflect functional roles. Furthermore, our FRET methods provide insight representative of physiological CaM-RyR structure, in synergy and comparison with cryo-EM models, which result from more disrupted samples. This technology will drive future studies focusing on pathologic CaM-RyR interactions, and on RyR dynamics with other important modulators.",

In this study, we delve into the dynamics of a mixed bacterial population comprising two distinct species with different morphology and motility aspects. Employing agent-based modeling and computer simulations, we analyze the impacts of size ratios and packing fractions on dispersal patterns, aggregate formation, clustering, and spatial ordering. Notably, we find that motility and anisotropy of elongated bacteria significantly influence the distribution and spatial organization of nonmotile spherical species. Passive spherical cells display superdiffusive behavior, particularly at smaller size ratios, while active rod-like cells exhibit normal diffusive behavior in the diffusion regime. As the size ratio increases, clustering of passive cells is observed, accompanied by enhanced alignment and closer packing of active cells in the presence of higher passive cell area fractions. As the size ratio increases, clustering of passive cells is observed, accompanied by enhanced alignment and closer packing of active cells in the presence of higher passive cell area fractions. Additionally, we identify the pivotal role of passive cell area fraction in influencing the response of active cells toward nematicity, with its dependence on size ratio. These findings shed light on the significance of morphology and motility in shaping the collective behavior of microbial communities, providing valuable insights into complex microbial behaviors with implications for ecology, biotechnology, and bioengineering.",

Here we report that sorting of sphingolipids (SLs) into the vacuole membrane controls this process. We first developed a vacuole isolation method to identify lipidome changes during the onset of phase separation in early stationary stage cells. We found that phase separated vacuoles are characterized by increases in lipid raft-forming components not found in the whole cell, including a dramatic change in SL composition. Sorting of both SLs and ergosterol into the vacuole membrane is dependent on Npc2, the yeast homologue of the Niemann-Pick Type C2 lipid transporter. Genetic dissection of SL biosynthesis revealed that the composition of vacuole SLs modulates membrane phase separation and micro-lipophagy under glucose restriction. These results show that lipid trafficking can drive membrane phase separation in vivo and identify SLs as key mediators of this process in yeast.",

There are twenty different O antigens composed of different repeat sugars structures conferring serogroup specificity, and ten are found most frequently in infection. Thus, one approach to combat infection by P. aeruginosa could be to generate immunity with a vaccine cocktail that includes all these serogroups. Serogroup O9 is one of the ten serogroups commonly found in infection, but it has never been developed into a vaccine, likely due, in part, to the acid labile nature of the O9 polysaccharide. Our laboratory has previously shown that intranasal administration of an attenuated Salmonella strain expressing the P. aeruginosa serogroup O11 LPS O antigen was effective in clearing and preventing mortality in mice following intranasal challenge with serogroup O11 P. aeruginosa. Consequently, we set out to develop a P. aeruginosa serogroup O9 vaccine using a similar approach. Here we show that Salmonella expressing serogroup O9 triggered an antibody-mediated immune response following intranasal administration to mice and that it conferred protection from P. aeruginosa serogroup O9 in a murine model of acute pneumonia.",

    "abstract": "Acid-responsive proteome expression profiles of Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris (A. acidoterrestris) were analysed using label-free quantitative mass spectrometry to investigate its acid resistance mechanism at sublethal pH. Totally, 325 differential expression proteins were identified during acid stress at pH2.5 condition for 15 min, of which the expressions of 83 proteins were up-regulated and the other 242 proteins expressions were down-regulated. Differentially expressed proteins were mainly involved in organic nitrogen compounds metabolism, small molecule metabolism, organic acid metabolism and signal transduction. Overall, they were mapped into 97 metabolic pathways. Combination of KEGG pathway analysis and protein functional analysis suggested that the pH homeostasis system, changes in metabolic pathways, cell membrane permeability and DNA repair are the main acid resistance mechanisms of A. acidoterrestris at sublethal pH conditions. It is speculated that A. acidoterrestris may sense and transmit pH signals from the external environment through the nhaB protein which holds histidine-dependent acid resistance system, initiating a series of acid tolerance reactions. Our study demonstrated global physiological response of A. acidoterrestris to sublethal pH, which provided a better understanding of acid adaption mechanism of A. acidoterrestris.",

    "abstract": "Variants at the SLC30A8 locus are associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk. The lead variant, rs13266634, encodes an amino acid change, Arg325Trp (R325W), at the C-terminus of the secretory granule-enriched zinc transporter, ZnT8. Although this protein-coding variant was previously thought to be the sole driver of altered disease risk, recent studies have provided evidence for lowered expression of SLC30A8 mRNA in protective allele carriers. In the present study, combined allele-specific expression (cASE) analysis in human islets revealed that multiple variants affect the expression SLC30A8. Chromatin accessibility and epigenomic analyses imply the existence at the SLC30A8 locus of an islet-selective super-enhancer cluster hosting multiple diabetes-associated variants. The variant region is spatially associated with both the SLC30A8 promoter and with the regulatory regions of the neighbouring RAD21, RAD21-AS1, UTP23 and other genes. Deletion of variant-bearing regions from human-derived EndoC-{beta}H3 cells using CRISPR-Cas9 lowered the expression of SLC30A8 and several neighbouring genes, suggesting their co-regulation by this enhancer cluster. Whilst deletion of SLC30A8 had no effect on beta cell survival under the conditions examined, loss of RAD21 or UTP23 markedly reduced cell viability. Thus, the protective effects of variants that lower SLC30A8 activity may be modulated by the altered expression of nearby genes. Direct evidence for this possibility was not, however, obtained by cASE or eQTL analysis of human islet samples.",

    "abstract": "Post Synaptic Density 95 (PSD95) is an important scaffolding protein found in the postsynaptic terminal of vertebrate excitatory synapses. PSD95 is required to structurally organize over 80 proteins, including glutamate receptors, signaling, adhesion and other molecules, into [~]1.5 MDa supercomplexes within the post-synaptic density. Despite its importance, little is known about the dynamics or heterogeneity of PSD95 in such supercomplexes. We have used single-molecule and super-resolution microscopy to probe the molecular organization of individual PSD95-containing supercomplexes isolated from mouse brain, revealing the number of PSD95 copies in each supercomplex, and the distances between the individual proteins. We have also examined the dynamic nature of these supercomplexes, discovering that PSD95 is replaced over several days. Importantly, we found that old copies of PSD95 are replaced with new protein within the supercomplexes, independent of whole-supercomplex turnover. This finding suggests the existence of a mechanism that allows for the maintenance of the overall structure of the post-synaptic density, despite the rapid turnover of individual proteins.",

    "abstract": "Children with developmental language disorder (DLD) struggle to learn their native language for no apparent reason. While research on the neurobiological underpinnings of the disorder has focused on the role of cortico-striatal systems, little is known about the role of the cerebellum in DLD. Cortico-cerebellar circuits might be involved in the disorder as they contribute to complex sensorimotor skill learning, including the acquisition of spoken language. Here, we used diffusion-weighted imaging data from 77 typically developing and 54 children with DLD and performed probabilistic tractography to identify the cerebellums white matter tracts: the inferior, middle, and superior cerebellar peduncles. Children with DLD showed lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in the inferior cerebellar peduncles (ICP), fiber tracts that carry motor and sensory input via the inferior olive to the cerebellum. Lower FA in DLD was driven by lower axial diffusivity. Probing this further with more sophisticated modeling of diffusion data, we found higher orientation dispersion but no difference in neurite density in the ICP of DLD. Reduced FA is therefore unlikely to be reflecting microstructural differences in myelination in this tract, rather the organization of axons in these pathways is disrupted. ICP microstructure was not associated with language or motor coordination performance in our sample. We also found no differences in the middle and superior peduncles, the main pathways connecting the cerebellum with the cortex. To conclude, it is not cortico-cerebellar but atypical olivocerebellar white matter connections that characterize DLD and suggest the involvement of the olivocerebellar system in speech acquisition and development.",

Although female-unique experiences like parity (pregnancy and motherhood) have positive effects on neuroplasticity at middle age, previous pregnancy may also contribute to AD risk. To explore these seemingly paradoxical long-term effects of parity, we investigated the impact of parity with APOE{varepsilon}4 genotype by examining behavioural and neural biomarkers of brain health in middle-aged female rats. Our findings show that primiparous (parous one time) hAPOE{varepsilon}4 rats display increased use of a non-spatial cognitive strategy and exhibit decreased number and recruitment of new-born neurons in the ventral dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in response to spatial working memory retrieval. Furthermore, primiparity and hAPOE{varepsilon}4 genotype synergistically modulate neuroinflammatory markers in the ventral hippocampus. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that previous parity in hAPOE{varepsilon}4 rats confers an added risk to present with reduced activity and engagement of the hippocampus as well as elevated pro-inflammatory signaling, and underscores the importance of considering female-specific factors and genotype in health research.\n\nO_LSTHighlightsC_LSTO_LIhAPOE{varepsilon}4 rats made more errors and used a non-spatial cognitive strategy\nC_LIO_LIPrimiparous hAPOE{varepsilon}4 rats increased use of a non-spatial cognitive strategy\nC_LIO_LIParity increased neurogenesis in wildtype rats, but decreased it in hAPOE{varepsilon}4 rats\nC_LIO_LIPrimiparous hAPOE{varepsilon}4 rats had less active new neurons in response to memory retrieval\nC_LIO_LIParity and hAPOE{varepsilon}4 affect the neuroimmune milieu in a region-specific manner\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Microglia diversity emerges from interactions between intrinsic genetic programs and environment-derived signals, but how these processes unfold and interact in the developing brain remains unclear. Here, we show that radial glia progenitor-expressed integrin beta 8 activates microglia-expressed TGFB1, permitting microglial development. Domain-restricted deletion of Itgb8 in these progenitors establishes complementary domains of developmentally arrested \"dysmature\" microglia and homeostatic microglia that persist into adulthood. In the absence of autocrine TGFB1 signaling, we find that microglia adopt a similar reactive microglial phenotype, leading to astrogliosis and neuromotor symptoms almost identical to Itgb8 mutant mice. By comparing mice with genetic deletions in critical components downstream of Itgb8, we show that non-canonical (Smad-independent) signaling partially suppresses the dysmature microglia phenotype, associated neuromotor dysfunction and expression of disease-associated genes, providing compelling evidence for the adoption of microglial developmental signaling pathways in the context of injury or disease.",
