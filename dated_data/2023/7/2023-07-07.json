    "abstract": "Argonaute protein is associated with post-transcriptional control of cytoplasmic gene expression through miRNA-induced silencing complexes (miRISC). Specific cellular and environmental conditions can trigger AGO protein to accumulate in the nucleus. Localization of AGO is central to understanding miRNA action, yet the consequences of AGO being in the nucleus are undefined. We show nuclear enrichment of AGO2 in HCT116 cells grown in two-dimensional culture to high density, HCT116 cells grown in three-dimensional tumor spheroid culture, and human colon tumors. The shift in localization of AGO2 from cytoplasm to nucleus de-represses cytoplasmic AGO2-eCLIP targets that were candidates for canonical regulation by miRISC. Constitutive nuclear localization of AGO2 using an engineered nuclear localization signal increases cell migration. Critical RNAi factors also affect the localization of AGO2. Knocking out an enzyme essential for miRNA biogenesis, DROSHA, depletes mature miRNAs and restricts AGO2 localization to the cytoplasm, while knocking out the miRISC scaffolding protein, TNRC6, results in nuclear localization of AGO2. These data suggest that AGO2 localization and miRNA activity can be regulated depending on environmental conditions, expression of mature miRNAs, and expression of miRISC cofactors. Localization and expression of core miRISC protein machinery should be considered when investigating the roles of miRNAs.",

    "abstract": "Cell surface receptors facilitate signaling and nutrient uptake. These processes are dynamic, requiring receptors to be actively recycled by endocytosis. Due to their differential expression in disease states, receptors are often the target of drug-carrier particles, which are adorned with ligands that bind specifically to receptors. These targeted particles are taken into the cell by multiple routes of internalization, where the best-characterized pathway is clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Most studies of particle uptake have utilized bulk assays, rather than observing individual endocytic events. As a result, the detailed mechanisms of particle uptake remain obscure. To address this gap, we have employed a live-cell imaging approach to study the uptake of individual liposomes as they interact with clathrin-coated structures. By tracking individual internalization events, we find that the size of liposomes, rather than the density of the ligands on their surfaces, primarily determines their probability of uptake. Interestingly, targeting has the greatest impact on endocytosis of liposomes of intermediate diameters, with the smallest and largest liposomes being internalized or excluded, respectively, regardless of whether they are targeted. These findings, which highlight a previously unexplored limitation of targeted delivery, can be used to design more effective drug carriers.",

    "abstract": "Transgenic corn and cotton expressing Cry and Vip insecticidal proteins from the bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), have been a valuable tool for the management of lepidopteran pests. In 2019, a Vip3Aa-resistant strain of Helicoverpa zea (CEW-Vip-RR) was isolated from F2 screens of field populations in Texas. Characterizing the resistance mechanism in this strain is important for predicting the sustained efficacy of current commercial Bt traits and guiding the development of future transgenic traits. Resistance to insecticidal proteins in Bt traits is commonly associated with reduced toxin binding, with the exception of Vip3Aa resistance being associated to altered proteolytic processing in the insect host gut. Therefore, Vip3Aa protoxin processing was tested by incubation with midgut fluids from CEW-Vip-RR relative to a susceptible strain (CEW-SS). Finding no significant processing differences, alterations in Vip3Aa binding were tested by comparing binding of radiolabeled and biotinylated Vip3Aa toxin to midgut brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) from CEW-Vip-RR and CEW-SS larvae. Specific Vip3Aa binding to CEW-Vip-RR BBMV in these experiments was consistently reduced when compared with CEW-SS BBMV. These results support that an altered Vip3Aa- receptor is associated with resistance in CEW-Vip-RR. Understanding this resistance mechanism could have important implications for resistance management decisions considering widespread Cry1 and Cry2 resistance in H. zea populations.\n\nIMPORTANCEHelicoverpa zea is a major crop pest in the United States that is managed with transgenic corn and cotton producing insecticidal proteins from the bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). However, H. zea has evolved widespread resistance to the Cry proteins produced in Bt corn and cotton, leaving Vip3Aa as the only plant incorporated protectant in Bt crops consistently providing excellent control of H. zea. The benefits provided by Bt crops will be substantially reduced if widespread Vip3Aa resistance develops in H. zea field populations. Therefore, it is important to identify resistance alleles and mechanisms that contribute to Vip3Aa resistance to ensure that informed resistance management strategies are implemented. This study is the first report of reduced binding of Vip3Aa to midgut receptors associated with resistance.",

    "abstract": "A limited subset of HIV-1 infected adult individuals typically after at least 2-3 years of chronic infection, develop broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), suggesting that highly conserved neutralizing epitopes on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein are difficult for B cell receptors to effectively target, during natural infection. Recent studies have shown the evolution of bnAbs in HIV-1 infected infants. We used bulk BCR sequencing (BCR-seq) to profile the B cell receptors from longitudinal samples (3 time points) collected from a rare pair of antiretroviral-naive, HIV-1 infected pediatric monozygotic twins (AIIMS_329 and AIIMS_330) who displayed elite plasma neutralizing activity against HIV-1. BCR-seq of both twins revealed convergent antibody characteristics including V-gene use, CDRH3 lengths and somatic hypermutation (SHM). Further, antibody clonotypes with genetic features similar to highly potent bnAbs isolated from adults showed ongoing development in donor AIIMS_330 but not in AIIMS_329, corroborating our earlier findings based on plasma bnAbs responses. An increase in SHM was observed in sequences of the IgA isotype from AIIMS_330. This study suggests that children living with chronic HIV-1 can develop clonotypes of HIV-1 bnAbs against multiple envelope epitopes similar to those isolated from adults, highlighting that such B cells could be steered to elicit bnAbs responses through vaccines aimed to induce bnAbs against HIV-1 in a broad range of people including children.",

    "abstract": "Childhood undernutrition is a major global health challenge with devastating lifelong consequences. Linear growth stunting due to undernutrition has been linked to poor outcomes, and mothers who experience stunting are more likely to give birth to stunted children. Murine models that capture the intergenerational and multifactorial nature of undernutrition are critical to understanding the underlying biology of this disorder. Here we report a gnotobiotic mouse model of undernutrition using microbiota from human infants with healthy or stunted growth trajectories. Intergenerational transmission of microbiota from parents to offspring leads to the development of growth and immune features of undernutrition and enteropathy, including reduced linear growth, intestinal villus blunting and accumulation of intraepithelial lymphocytes. In contrast, colonization after weaning reduces sensitivity to detect changes driven by distinct microbial communities. Overall, these results suggest intergenerational colonization is a useful approach with which to investigate microbiota-dependent growth and immunity in early life.",

    "abstract": "The human gut microbiota is able to degrade otherwise undigestible polysaccharides, largely through the activity of the Bacteroides. Uptake of polysaccharides into Bacteroides is controlled by TonB-dependent transporters (TBDT) whose transport is energized by an inner membrane complex composed of the proteins TonB, ExbB, and ExbD. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (B. theta) encodes 11 TonB homologs which are predicted to be able to contact TBDTs to facilitate transport. However, it is not clear which TonBs are important for polysaccharide uptake. Using strains in which each of the 11 predicted tonB genes are deleted, we show that TonB4 (BT2059) is important but not essential for proper growth on starch. In the absence of TonB4, we observed an increase in abundance of TonB6 (BT2762) in the membrane of B. theta, suggesting functional redundancy of these TonB proteins. Growth of the single deletion strains on pectin galactan, chondroitin sulfate, arabinan, and levan suggests a similar functional redundancy of the TonB proteins. A search for highly homologous proteins across other Bacteroides species and recent work in B. fragilis suggests that TonB4 is widely conserved and may play a common role in polysaccharide uptake. However, proteins similar to TonB6 are found only in B. theta and closely related species suggesting that the functional redundancy of TonB4 and TonB6 may be limited across the Bacteroides. This study extends our understanding of the protein network required for polysaccharide utilization in B. theta and highlights differences in TonB complexes across Bacteroides species.\n\nImportanceThe human gut microbiota, including the Bacteroides, is required for the degradation of otherwise undigestible polysaccharides. The gut microbiota uses polysaccharides as an energy source and the fermentation products such as short chain fatty acids are beneficial to the human host. This use of polysaccharides is dependent on the proper pairing of a TonB protein with polysaccharide-specific TonB-dependent transporters; however, formation of these protein complexes is poorly understood. In this study, we examine the role of 11 predicted TonB homologs in polysaccharide uptake. We show that two proteins, TonB4 and TonB6, may be functionally redundant. This may allow for development of drugs targeting Bacteroides species containing only a TonB4 homolog with limited impact on species encoding the redundant TonB6.",

    "abstract": "Shh signaling is the morphogen signaling that regulates embryonic craniofacial and neural tube development. G protein-coupled receptor 161 (Gpr161) is a negative regulator of Shh signaling, and its inactivation in mice results in embryo lethality with craniofacial and neural tube defects (NTDs). However, the structural defects of later embryonic stages in Gpr161 null mice and cell lineages underlying abnormalities were not well characterized due to their limited lifespan. We found the Pax3 lineage-specific deletion of Gpr161 in mice presented with tectal hypertrophy (anterior dorsal neuroepithelium), cranial vault and facial bone hypoplasia (cranial neural crest (CNC)), vertebral abnormalities (somite), and the closed form of spina bifida (posterior dorsal neuroepithelium). In particular, the closed form of spina bifida is partly due to the reduced Pax3 and Cdx4 gene expression of the posterior dorsal neural tubes of Gpr161 mutant embryos involving decreased Wnt signaling whereas Shh signaling was increased. This study provides the novel role of Gpr161 in the posterior neural tube development and confirms its role on CNC- and somite-derived skeletogenesis and midbrain morphogenesis in mice.",

    "abstract": "The white matter is made of anatomical fibres that constitute the highway of long-range connections between different parts of the brain. This network is referred to as the brains structural connectivity and lays the foundation of network interaction between brain areas. When analysing the architectural principles of this global network most studies have mainly focused on cortico-cortical and partly on cortico-subcortical connections. Here we show, for the first time, how the integrated cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar brain areas shape the structural architecture of the whole brain. We find that dense clusters vertically transverse cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar brain areas, which are themselves centralised by a global rich-club consisting similarly of cortical and subcortical brain areas. Notably, the most prominent hubs can be found in subcortical brain regions, and their targeted in-silico lesions proved to be most harmful for global signal propagation. Individually, the cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar sub-networks manifest distinct network features despite some similarities, which underline their unique structural fingerprints. Our results, exposing the heterogeneity of internal organisation across cortex, subcortex, and cerebellum, and the crucial role of the subcortex for the integration of the global anatomical pathways, highlight the need to overcome the prevalent cortex-centric focus towards a global consideration of the structural connectivity.",

    "abstract": "The rate at which populations adapt depends on the probability and time of fixation of beneficial alleles. Both of these quantities can be significantly impacted by population subdivision and limited gene flow. However, how limited dispersal through its combined effects on the probability and time to fixation influences the rate of adaptation via hard and soft sweeps remains understudied. We investigate this here using the diffusion approximation and simulations. In contrast to previous suggestions, we find that adaptation may take on average fewer generations under limited dispersal than under panmixia. This is especially true if adaptation occurs via hard sweeps of recessive alleles, and dispersal is not too limited (such that approximately FST < 0.25). The reason is that such mildly limited dispersal leads to only a moderate increase in effective population size (which slows down fixation), but is sufficient to cause a relative excess of homozygosity due to inbreeding, thereby exposing rare recessive alleles to selection (which accelerates fixation). We also explore the effect of meta-population dynamics through local extinction followed by recolonization, finding that such dynamics always accelerate adaptation via soft sweeps, while hard sweeps exhibit faster fixation interspersed with longer waiting times. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the detection of sweeps, suggesting that limited dispersal mitigates the expected differences between the genetic signatures of sweeps involving recessive and dominant alleles.",
