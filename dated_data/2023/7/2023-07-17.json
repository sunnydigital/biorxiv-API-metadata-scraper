    "abstract": "We use open source human gut microbiome data to learn a microbial \"language\" model by adapting techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP). Our microbial \"language\" model is trained in a self-supervised fashion (i.e., without additional external labels) to capture the interactions among different microbial species and the common compositional patterns in microbial communities. The learned model produces contextualized taxa representations that allow a single bacteria species to be represented differently according to the specific microbial environment it appears in. The model further provides a sample representation by collectively interpreting different bacteria species in the sample and their interactions as a whole. We show that, compared to baseline representations, our sample representation consistently leads to improved performance for multiple prediction tasks including predicting Irritable Bowel Disease (IBD) and diet patterns. Coupled with a simple ensemble strategy, it produces a highly robust IBD prediction model that generalizes well to microbiome data independently collected from different populations with substantial distribution shift.\n\nWe visualize the contextualized taxa representations and find that they exhibit meaningful phylum-level structure, despite never exposing the model to such a signal. Finally, we apply an interpretation method to highlight bacterial species that are particularly influential in driving our models predictions for IBD.\n\nAuthor summaryHuman microbiomes and their interactions with various body systems have been linked to a wide range of diseases and lifestyle variables. To understand these links, citizen science projects such as the American Gut Project (AGP) have provided large open-source datasets for microbiome investigation. In this work we leverage such open-source data and learn a \"language\" model for human gut microbiomes using techniques derived from natural language processing. We train the \"language\" model to capture the interactions among different microbial species and the common compositional patterns that shape gut microbiome communities. By considering the entirety of species within a sample and their interactions, our model produces a representation that enables contextualized interpretation of individual bacterial species within their microbial environment. We demonstrate that our sample representation enhances prediction performance compared to baseline methods across multiple microbiome tasks including prediction of Irritable Bowel Disease (IBD) and diet patterns. Furthermore, our learned representation yields a robust IBD prediction model that generalizes well to independent data collected from different populations. To gain insight into our models workings, we present interpretation results that showcase its ability to learn biologically meaningful representations.",

In this study, we present a pipeline for designing, multiplexing, and sequencing highly polymorphic taxon-specific amplicons using PacBio circular consensus sequencing. We focus on the wheat microbiome as a proof-of-principle and demonstrate unprecedented resolution for the wheat-associated Pseudomonas microbiome and the ubiquitous fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. Our approach achieves an order of magnitude higher phylogenetic resolution compared to existing ribosomal amplicons. We show that the designed amplicons accurately capture species and strain diversity outperforming full-length 16S and ITS amplicons. We track microbial communities in the wheat phyllosphere across time and space to establish fine-grained species and strain-specific dynamics. The high-resolution profiling provided by taxon-specific amplicons opens new avenues for studying microbial community dynamics in complex environments. Moreover, the cost-effectiveness and scalability of our approach make it applicable to diverse ecological studies. Overall, our work demonstrates the potential of long-read amplicon sequencing to overcome limitations in phylogenetic resolution and enhance our understanding of microbiome diversity and dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains cause considerable morbidity and mortality. Identification of novel targets in this notorious pathogen is urgently warranted to facilitate discovery of new anti-pathogenic agents acting against it. Attacking non-essential targets is believed to be a potential anti-virulence strategy. This study attempted to identify small molecule inhibitors of two important proteins LasR and nitric oxide reductase (NOR) in P. aeruginosa. This bacterial pathogen possesses multiple quorum sensing (QS) systems to regulate expression of many of its genes including those associated with virulence. Among these QS systems,  Las system can be said to be the  master regulator, whose receptor protein is LasR. Similarly, NOR plays crucial role in detoxification of reactive nitrogen species. This study attempted in silico identification of potential LasR or NOR inhibitors through a virtual screen employing AtomNet(R), a proprietary deep learning neural network. Following virtual screening of a large number of compounds for their affinity to LasR or NOR, a final subset of <100 compounds was created by clustering and filtering the top scoring compounds. These compounds were evaluated for their in vivo anti-pathogenic activity by challenging the model host Caenorhabditis elegans with P. aeruginosa in presence or absence of test compounds. Survival of the worm population in 24-well assay plates was monitored over a period of 5 days microscopically. Of the 96 predicted LasR inhibitors, 11 exhibited anti-Pseudomonas activity (23-96% inhibition of bacterial virulence as per third-day end point) at 25-50 {micro}g/ml. Of the 85 predicted NOR inhibitors, 8 exhibited anti-Pseudomonas activity (40-85% inhibition of bacterial virulence as per second-day end point) at 25-50 {micro}g/ml. Further investigation on molecular mode of action of active compounds is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Postembryonic primary root growth relies on meristems that harbour multipotent stem cells that produce new cells that will duplicate and provide all the different root cell types. Arabidopsis thaliana primary root growth has become a model for evo-devo studies due to its simplicity and facility to record cell proliferation and differentiation. To identify new genetic components relevant to primary root growth, we used a Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) meta-analysis approach using data published in the last decade. In this work, we performed intra and inter-studies analyses to discover new genetic components that could participate in primary root growth. We used 639 accessions from nine different studies and performed different GWAS tests ranging from single studies and pairwise analysis with high correlation associations, analyzing the same number of accessions in different studies to using the daily data of the root growth kinetic of the same research. We found that primary root growth changes were associated with 41 genomic loci, of which six (14.6%) have been previously described as inhibitors or promoters of primary root growth. The knockdown of genes associated with two of these loci: a gene that participates in Trans-acting siRNAs (tasiRNAs) processing Suppressor of Gene Silencing (SGS3) and a gene with a Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM) confirmed their participation as repressors of primary root growth. As none has been shown to participate in this developmental process before, our GWAS analysis identified new genes that participate in primary root growth. Overall, our findings provide novel insights into the genomic basis of root development and further demonstrate the usefulness of GWAS meta-analyses in non-human species.",

    "abstract": "With 78 species, Sinocyclocheilus cavefish constitute the largest cavefish radiation in the world. They exhibit remarkable morphological diversity across three habitat types: surface (Surface morphs, Normal-eyed, variably colored), exclusively-cave-dwelling (Stygobitic morphs, Eyeless, depigmented), and intermediate between cave and surface (Stygophilic morphs, Micro-eyed, partially depigmented). Distinctive traits of Sinocyclocheilus include variations in eye and skin conditions associated with their habitat, despite the role of the skin in sensing environmental changes, its habitat correlates are less understood, compared to the well-studied eye conditions. Here, we analyzed the correlation between Sinocyclocheilus skin morphology and its habitat, utilizing morphological and transcriptomics-based methods. We generated RNA-sequencing data for nine species and integrated those with existing data from five additional species. These 14 species represent the primary clades and major habitats of these cavefish. Data on skin color and scale morphology were generated and 7374 orthologous genes were identified. Using a comparative transcriptomics approach, we identified 1,348 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the three morphotypes. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses suggest that these species have evolved different strategies for energy metabolism, immunity, and oxidative stress in different habitats. We also found 329 positive selection genes (PSGs) in the skin of these species that are mainly involved in immunity, apoptosis, and necrosis, indicating potential adaptations to their habitats. The maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree, based on 1369 single-copy orthologous genes of the species, was largely concordant with the currently established RAD-seq and mt-DNA based phylogenies, but with a few exceptions. Species with higher cave dependence present lighter coloration, fewer dark blotches, and diminished scale morphology and coverage. PCA and cluster analysis suggested that cave-dwelling species, characterized by the absence of black blotches, have similar expression patterns, indicating convergence in cave adaptation. Variations in tyrosine metabolism may explain pigmentation differences among species in diverse habitats. Our study highlights the significance of habitat in shaping skin metabolism, pigmentation variation, and morphology while offering insights into the molecular mechanisms driving these habitat-specific adaptations in Sinocyclocheilus. These findings underscore the transcriptional variation in adapting to diverse environments and contribute to future studies on the evolution and ecology of cavefish.",

However, engineering microbes and continuously evolving them to enhance the production of industrially relevant products is a complex and challenging task, requiring precise selection of genetic traits to achieve desired outcomes. In this study, we report the development of a novel counter-selectable growth-sensitive malonyl-CoA platform strain by coupling the malonyl-CoA repressor FapR from Bacillus subtilis to essential gene promoters involved in glucose growth and the plasma membrane arginine permease. This platform strain was then coupled with a CRISPR-dCas9 guide-RNA (gRNA) library, which after multiple rounds of dilutions and library sequencing, resulted in the enrichment for gRNAs that increased fluxes towards malonyl-CoA. The enriched gRNAs were validated for their effects on growth enhancement, gene regulation, and the production of an industrially relevant malonyl-CoA product, namely 3-hydroxypropionic acid. This study highlights an innovative approach to microbial engineering and opens up avenues for further exploration in the field of laboratory continuous evolution.",

    "abstract": "Genetically encoded sensors enable quantitative imaging of analytes in live cells. State-of-the-art sensors are commonly constructed by combining ligand-binding domains with one or more sensitized fluorescent protein (FP) domains. Sensors based on a single FP are susceptible to artifacts caused by differing expression levels or sensor distribution in vivo. Hence, our lab developed dual-FP Matryoshka technology introduced by a single cassette that contains a stable large Stokes shift (LSS) reference FP nested within a reporter FP (cpEGFP), allowing simple construction of intensiometric sensors with the capacity for ratiometric quantification. The first-generation Green-Orange (GO) Matryoshka cassette established proof of concept but required custom optical setups to maximize achievable dynamic range. Here, we present a genetically encoded calcium sensor that employs optimized second-generation Green-Apple (GA) Matryoshka technology that incorporates a newly designed red LSSmApple fluorophore. LSSmApple provides improved excitation spectrum overlap with cpEGFP, allowing for monochromatic co-excitation with blue light. The exceptionally large Stokes shift of LSSmApple results in improved emission spectrum separation from cpEGFP, which minimizes fluorophore bleed-through and facilitates imaging using standard dichroics and red fluorescent protein (RFP) emission filters. We developed an image analysis pipeline for yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) timelapse imaging that utilizes LSSmApple to segment and track cells for high-throughput quantitative analysis. In summary, we engineered a new fluorescent protein, constructed a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GA-MatryoshCaMP6s), and performed calcium imaging in yeast as a demonstration.",

    "abstract": "Metabolomics is a powerful tool for uncovering biochemical diversity in a wide range of organisms, and metabolic network modeling is commonly used to frame results in the context of a broader homeostatic system. However, network modeling of poorly characterized, non-model organisms remains challenging due to gene homology mismatches. To address this challenge, we developed Metabolic Interactive Nodular Network for Omics (MINNO), a web-based mapping tool that takes in empirical metabolomics data to refine metabolic networks for both model and unusual organisms. MINNO allows users to create and modify interactive metabolic pathway visualizations for thousands of organisms, in both individual and multi-species contexts. Herein, we demonstrate an important application of MINNO in elucidating the metabolic networks of understudied species, such as those of the Borrelia genus, which cause Lyme disease and relapsing fever. Using a hybrid genomics-metabolomics modeling approach, we constructed species-specific metabolic networks for three Borrelia species. Using these empirically refined networks, we were able to metabolically differentiate these genetically similar species via their nucleotide and nicotinate metabolic pathways that cannot be predicted from genomic networks. These examples illustrate the use of metabolomics for the empirical refining of genetically constructed networks and show how MINNO can be used to study non-model organisms.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=199 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/548964v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (30K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8cdee6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7de3ddorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fac57forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bc2efe_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG MINNO tool facilitates refining of metabolic networks, multi omics integration and investigation of cross-species interactions.\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "1Virus symbionts are important mediators of ecosystem function, yet we know little of their diversity and ecology in natural populations. The alarming decline of pollinating insects, especially the European honey bee, Apis mellifera, has been driven in part by worldwide transmission of virus pathogens. Previous work has examined the transmission of known honey bee virus pathogens to wild bee populations, but only a handful of studies have investigated the native viromes associated with these bees, limiting epidemiological predictors associated with viral pathogenesis. Further, social variation among different bee species might have important consequences in the acquisition and maintenance of bee-associated virome diversity.\n\nWe utilized comparative metatranscriptomics to develop a baseline description of the RNA viromes associated with wild bee pollinators and to document the interaction between hymenopteran insect social behavior and virus community composition. Our sampling includes five wild-caught, native bee species that vary in social behavior as well as managed honey bees. We describe 26 putatively new RNA virus species and contrary to our expectations, find few differences in virus diversity or abundance among socially variable bee species. Each bee species was associated with a specific virus community composition, even among sympatric populations of distinct host species. From 17 samples of a single host species, we recovered a single virus species despite over 600 km of distance between host populations and found strong evidence for isolation-by distance in associated viral populations. Our work adds to the small number of studies examining viral prevalence and community composition in wild bees.",

    "abstract": "Machine Learning models have been frequently used in transcriptome analyses. Particularly, Representation Learning (RL), e.g., autoencoders, are effective in learning critical representations in noisy data. However, learned representations, e.g., the \"latent variables\" in an autoencoder, are difficult to interpret, not to mention prioritizing essential genes for functional follow-up. In contrast, in traditional analyses, one may identify important genes such as Differentially Expressed (DiffEx), Differentially Co-Expressed (DiffCoEx), and Hub genes. Intuitively, the complex gene-gene interactions may be beyond the capture of marginal effects (DiffEx) or correlations (DiffCoEx and Hub), indicating the need of powerful RL models. However, the lack of interpretability and individual target genes is an obstacle for RLs broad use in practice. To facilitate interpretable analysis and gene-identification using RL, we propose \"Critical genes\", defined as genes that contribute highly to learned representations (e.g., latent variables in an autoencoder). As a proof-of-concept, supported by eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), we implemented eXplainable Autoencoder for Critical genes (XA4C) that quantifies each genes contribution to latent variables, based on which Critical genes are prioritized. Applying XA4C to gene expression data in six cancers showed that Critical genes capture essential pathways underlying cancers. Remarkably, Critical genes has little overlap with Hub or DiffEx genes, however, has a higher enrichment in a comprehensive disease gene database (DisGeNET), evidencing its potential to disclose massive unknown biology. As an example, we discovered five Critical genes sitting in the center of Lysine degradation (hsa00310) pathway, displaying distinct interaction patterns in tumor and normal tissues. In conclusion, XA4C facilitates explainable analysis using RL and Critical genes discovered by explainable RL empowers the study of complex interactions.\n\nAuthor SummaryWe propose a gene expression data analysis tool, XA4C, which builds an eXplainable Autoencoder to reveal Critical genes. XA4C disentangles the black box of the neural network of an autoencoder by providing each genes contribution to the latent variables in the autoencoder. Next, a genes ability to contribute to the latent variables is used to define the importance of this gene, based on which XA4C prioritizes \"Critical genes\". Notably, we discovered that Critical genes enjoy two properties: (1) Their overlap with traditional differentially expressed genes and hub genes are poor, suggesting that they indeed brought novel insights into transcriptome data that cannot be captured by traditional analysis. (2) The enrichment of Critical genes in a comprehensive disease gene database (DisGeNET) is higher than differentially expressed or hub genes, evidencing their strong relevance to disease pathology. Therefore, we conclude that XA4C can reveal an additional landscape of gene expression data.",

    "abstract": "In this work we investigate how spatial proximity of enzymes belonging to the same pathway (metabolon) affects metabolic flux. Using off-lattice Langevin Dynamics (LD) simulations in tandem with a stochastic reaction-diffusion protocol and a semi-analytical reaction-diffusion model, we systematically explored how strength of protein-protein interactions, catalytic efficiency and protein-ligand interactions affect metabolic flux through the metabolon. Formation of a metabolon leads to a greater speed up for longer pathways and especially for reaction-limited enzymes while for fully optimized diffusion-limited enzymes the effect is negligible. Notably, specific cluster architectures are not a prerequisite for enhancing reaction flux. Simulations uncover the crucial role of optimal non-specific protein-ligand interactions in enhancing catalytic efficiency of a metabolon. Our theory implies and bioinformatics analysis confirms that longer catalytic pathways are enriched in less optimal enzymes while most diffusion-limited enzymes populate shorter pathways. Our findings point towards a plausible evolutionary strategy where enzymes compensate for less-than-optimal efficiency by increasing their local concentration in the clustered state.",

    "abstract": "Ras is a small GTPase that is central to important functional decisions in diverse cell types. An important aspect of Ras signaling is its ability to exhibit bimodal, or switch-like activity. We describe the total reconstitution of a receptor-mediated Ras activation-deactivation reaction catalyzed by SOS and p120-RasGAP on supported lipid membrane microarrays. The results reveal a bimodal Ras activation response, which is not a result of classic kinetic bistability, but is rather driven by the distinct processivity of the Ras activator, SOS. Furthermore, the bimodal response is controlled by the condensation state of the scaffold protein, LAT, to which SOS is recruited. Processivity-driven bimodality leads to stochastic bursts of Ras activation even under strongly deactivating conditions. This behavior contrasts classic kinetic bistability and is distinctly more resistant to pharmacological inhibition.",

Here we use genetically engineered lung cancer mouse models and patient samples to dissect how LKB1 mutations accelerate tumor growth by reshaping the immune microenvironment. Comprehensive immune profiling of LKB1-mutant vs wildtype tumors revealed dramatic changes in myeloid cells, specifically enrichment of Arg1+ interstitial macrophages and SiglecFHi neutrophils. We discovered a novel mechanism whereby autocrine LIF signaling in Lkb1-mutant tumors drives tumorigenesis by reprogramming myeloid cells in the immune microenvironment. Inhibiting LIF signaling in Lkb1-mutant tumors, via gene targeting or with a neutralizing antibody, resulted in a striking reduction in Arg1+ interstitial macrophages and SiglecFHi neutrophils, expansion of antigen specific T cells, and inhibition of tumor progression. Thus, targeting LIF signaling provides a new therapeutic approach to reverse the immunosuppressive microenvironment of LKB1-mutant tumors.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle function is impaired in menopause and exercise may mitigate tshis decline. We used the VCD model of menopause to investigate the effects of gradual ovarian failure on skeletal muscle contractile function and whether high intensity interval training (HIIT) can mitigate impairments. Sexually mature female CD-1 mice were assigned to one of three groups: control (n=5), VCD-sedentary (n=5), or VCD-training (n=5). Following ovarian failure, the VCD-training group underwent 8 weeks of uphill HIIT. Mice were sacrificed 8 weeks after ovarian failure, representing late menopause. Single muscle fibres from the soleus (SOL) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles were dissected, chemically permeabilized, and mechanically tested. Single muscle fibres were maximally activated (pCa 4.5) then isotonic load clamps were performed to calculate force-velocity-power curves. Absolute force and peak power were 31% and 32% lower in VCD-sedentary fibres compared to control fibres, respectively, in both SOL and EDL muscles. Despite reductions in absolute force and therefore lighter relative loads imposed during the isotonic contractions in VCD-sedentary fibres, there were no concomitant increases in contractile velocity. HIIT was partially effective at mitigating power loss (22% higher peak power in VCD-training compared to VCD-sedentary), but only in fast-type SOL fibres. These findings indicate that ovarian failure impairs dynamic contractile function - likely through a combination of lower force-generating capacity and slower shortening velocity - and that HIIT may be insufficient to completely counteract the deleterious effects of menopause at the cellular level.\n\nNew & NoteworthyO_LIReductions in circulating ovarian hormones impair static muscle contractile performance, but less is known about dynamic properties like power.\nC_LIO_LITypically, rodent models of menopause completely remove the ovaries and fail to mimic the prolonged and complex hormonal transition that includes a retention in ovarian androgen production.\nC_LIO_LIUsing an ovary intact VCD model of ovarian failure, we found that single fibre power was impaired compared with controls in both SOL and EDL fibres.\nC_LIO_LIOur uphill high intensity interval training program was partially sufficient to reverse power loss, but only in fast-type SOL fibres.\nC_LIO_LIImpairments in muscle power following ovarian failure are likely driven by a combination of decreased muscle size and force-generating capacity.\nC_LI",

EARLY FLOWERING3 (ELF3), PSEUDO RESPONSE REGULATOR (PRR9), and PRR7 are essential components of the plant circadian clock and facilitate entrainment of the clock to internal and external stimuli. Previous studies have highlighted a critical role for ELF3 in repressing the expression of PRR9 and PRR7. However, the functional significance of activity in regulating circadian clock dynamics and plant development is unknown. To explore this regulatory dynamic further, we firstly employed mathematical modelling to simulate the effect of the prr9/prr7 mutation on the elf3 circadian phenotype. These simulations suggested that simultaneous mutations in prr9/prr7 could rescue the elf3 circadian arrythmia. Following these simulations, we generated all Arabidopsis elf3/prr9/prr7 mutant combinations and investigated their circadian and developmental phenotypes. Although these assays could not replicate the results from the mathematical modelling, our results have revealed a complex epistatic relationship between ELF3 and PRR9/7 in regulating different aspects of plant development. ELF3 was essential for hypocotyl development under ambient and warm temperatures, while PRR9 was critical for root thermomorphogenesis. Finally, mutations in prr9 and prr7 rescued the photoperiod insensitive flowering phenotype of the elf3 mutant. Together, our results highlight the importance of investigating the genetic relationship amongst plant circadian genes.",

    "abstract": "Extrachromosomal DNAs (ecDNAs) are found in the nucleus of an array of human cancer cells where they can form clusters that were associated to oncogene overexpression, as they carry genes and cis-regulatory elements. Yet, the mechanisms of aggregation and gene amplification beyond copy-number effects remain mostly unclear. Here, we investigate, at the single molecule level, MYC-harboring ecDNAs of COLO320-DM colorectal cancer cells by use of a minimal polymer model of the interactions of ecDNA BRD4 binding sites and BRD4 molecules. We find that BRD4 induces ecDNAs phase separation, resulting in the self-assembly of clusters whose predicted structure is validated against HiChIP data (Hung et al., 2021). Clusters establish in-trans associated contact domains (I-TADs) enriched, beyond copy number, in regulatory contacts among specific ecDNA regions, encompassing its PVT1-MYC fusions but not its other canonical MYC copy. That explains why the fusions originate most of ecDNA MYC transcripts (Hung et al., 2021), and shows that ecDNA clustering per se is important but not sufficient to amplify oncogene expression beyond copy-number, reconciling opposite views on the role of clusters (Hung et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2021; Purshouse et al. 2022). Regulatory contacts become strongly enriched as soon as half a dozen ecDNAs aggregate, then saturate because of steric hindrance, highlighting that even cells with few ecDNAs can experience pathogenic MYC upregulations. To help drug design and therapeutic applications, with the model we dissect the effects of JQ1, a BET inhibitor. We find that JQ1 reverses ecDNA phase separation hence abolishing I-TADs and extra regulatory contacts, explaining how in COLO320-DM cells it reduces MYC transcription (Hung et al., 2021).",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms of the pectoral girdle transformation at the origin of terrestrial locomotion in vertebrates remains an outstanding problem in evolutionary biology1. The loss of dermal bones and the enlargement of endochondral bones resulted in the disarticulation of the pectoral girdle from the skull and the formation of the neck during the fish-to-tetrapod transition2-5. Despite the functional implications of this skeletal shift in the emergence of terrestrial vertebrates, the underlying genetic-developmental alterations have remained enigmatic. Here, we discovered that in zebrafish pectoral girdle mesodermal cells expressing gli3, a transcription factor in the Hedgehog signaling pathway, contribute to both dermal and endochondral bones. We show that Gli3 regulates expression of activin A receptor type 1-like, a BMP type 1 receptor lost in tetrapod lineages, and thereby determines endochondral and dermal ossification. Intriguingly, Gli and Hedgehog compound knockout fish exhibited an unexpected combination of actinopterygian fish and stem-tetrapod pectoral girdle characteristics. These ontogenetic and anatomical data suggest that a trade-off between the two distinct ossification pathways is a deeply embedded developmental program in bony fishes, with potential for tuning of this trade-off to generate novel pectoral girdle forms akin to stem-tetrapods at the dawn of vertebrate terrestrialization.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSegmentation and genome annotations (SAGA) methods such as ChromHMM and Segway are widely to annotate chromatin states in the genome. These algorithms take as input a collection of genomics datasets, partition the genome, and assign a label to each segment such that positions with the same label have similar patterns in the input data. SAGA methods output an human-interpretable summary of the genome by labeling every genomic position with its annotated activity such as Enhancer, Transcribed, etc. Chromatin state annotations are essential for many genomic tasks, including identifying active regulatory elements and interpreting disease-associated genetic variation. However, despite the widespread applications of SAGA methods, no principled approach exists to evaluate the statistical significance of SAGA state assignments.\n\nResultsTowards the goal of producing robust chromatin state annotations, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of the reproducibility of SAGA methods. We show that SAGA annotations exhibit a large degree of disagreement, even when run with the same method on replicated data sets. This finding suggests that there is significant risk to using SAGA chromatin state annotations.\n\nTo remedy this problem, we introduce SAGAconf, a method for assigning a measure of confidence (r-value) to SAGA annotations. This r-value is assigned to each genomic bin of a SAGA annotation and represents the probability that the label of this bin will be reproduced in a replicated experiment. This process is analogous to irreproducible discovery rate (IDR) analysis that is commonly used for ChIP-seq peak calling and related tasks. Thus SAGAconf allows a researcher to select only the reliable parts of a SAGA annotation for use in downstream analyses.\n\nSAGAconf r-values provide accurate confidence estimates of SAGA annotations, allowing researchers to filter out unreliable elements and remove doubt in those that stand up to this scrutiny.",

The E3 ligase CHIP is canonically regulated by its interactions with the molecular chaperones Hsp70 and Hsp90, which focus CHIPs ubiquitination activity on misfolded proteins. Here, we report a chaperone-independent interaction of CHIP with the membrane-anchored protein CHIC2, which strongly attenuates CHIPs ligase activity. We show that CHIC2 outcompetes abundant, cytosolic chaperones through its exquisite CHIP selectivity, rather than through enhanced affinity. In proteomic experiments, we find that CHIC2 knockout phenocopies CHIP knockout in certain cell types, implying that chaperone-independent interactions can sometimes predominate CHIPs functions. Furthermore, loss of the CHIP-CHIC2 interaction induces neurodegeneration and shortens lifespan in C. elegans, demonstrating that formation of this chaperone-independent complex is important in animals. We propose that CHIC2 attenuates CHIP activity at the membrane, offering a novel mechanism by which this ubiquitin ligase can be regulated.",

How LKB1-deficiency alters the phenotypical landscape and hierarchical organization of epithelial tissues to mediate increased cancer risk remains poorly understood. Here, we employ small intestinal organoids to investigate these issues for heterozygous and homozygous Lkb1 epithelial loss. We show that Lkb1 loss causes an allele dosage-dependent activation of a transcriptional program for tissue repair that is already induced in stem cell populations and mediates alterations in secretory cell type morphology and positioning. Furthermore, this shift towards a regenerative state omits the need for EGF supplementation, thus inducing niche-independent properties. Strikingly, we uncover that heterozygous loss of Lkb1 is sufficient to push the epithelium into a premalignant program for colorectal carcinogenesis along the serrated pathway, which is further amplified by loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) or Kras mutations. We conclude that persistent upregulation of a regenerative program due to LKB1 loss alters cellular hierarchy and induces niche independency, which predisposes PJS epithelium to uncontrolled growth along the serrated pathway.",

    "abstract": "To improve the assessment of metal toxicity in aquatic organisms, it is important to consider the different uptake pathways (i.e. trophic or dissolved). The bioaccumulation of dissolved metals such as Cd and Zn is beginning to be well described in gammarids. But there are very few data concerning the contribution of the diet route, and its related toxicokinetic parameters. Among these, the assimilation efficiency is an essential parameter for the implementation of models considering the trophic pathway. This study aims to estimate the assimilation efficiencies and elimination rates of two type of food, i.e. alder leaves and larvae of chironomids, contaminated by three metals (Ag, Cd and Zn) of major concern for the Water Framework Directive (WFD). The pulse-chase-feeding method was used. Gammarids were fed with alder leaves or chironomid larvae previously contaminated with 110mAg, 109Cd or 65Zn, for a short period of time (1 to 5 hours), followed by an elimination phase of 14 days. At different time steps, the gammarids were placed alive on the gamma detector to quantify individually the whole-body concentrations of 110mAg, 109Cd or 65Zn. Our results indicate that: i) Cd has the highest assimilation efficiency (44% for leaves and 34% for larvae), followed by Zn (14% for leaves and 9% for larvae) and Ag (5% for leaves); ii) for Cd and Zn, the AE were higher when gammarids were fed with leaves than with larvae; iii) the elimination rates of metals seem to depend more on the food matrix than the metal assimilated; and thus iv) the biological half-life calculated from the kes is 5.1 days for Ag, between 4.9 and 13 days for Cd and between 3.8 and 13 days for Zn.",

The expression of a mammalian calcium-dependent, membrane-binding protein, bovine annexin A4, in E. coli was found to reverse the inhibitory effects on cytokinesis of the beta-lactam antibiotics ampicillin, piperacillin, and cephalexin. This novel activity of the annexin was blocked by mutation of calcium binding sites in the annexin, indicating roles for calcium binding to the annexin and the binding of the annexin to membranes in restoring cytokinesis. The filamentous form of the bacteria has been reported to be more resistant to phagocytosis by cells of the immune system in eukaryotic hosts. Therefore, expression of annexins in pathogenic bacteria, by promoting the breakdown of the bacterial filaments, might serve as an adjuvant to enhance the efficacy of beta-lactam antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "Selective drug targets (i.e., narrow-spectrum antibiotics) can minimize side effects of antibiotic treatments compared to broad-spectrum antibiotics due to their specific targeting of the organisms responsible for the infection. Furthermore, combating an infectious pathogen, especially a drug-resistant organism, is more efficient by attacking multiple targets. Here, we combined synthetic lethality with selective drug targeting to obtain multi-target and organism-specific potential drug candidates by systematically analyzing the genome-scale metabolic models of six different microorganisms. By considering microorganisms as targeted or conserved in one- to six-member groups, we designed 665 individual case studies. For each case, we identified single essential reactions as well as double, triple, and quadruple synthetic lethal reaction sets that are lethal for targeted microorganisms and neutral for conserved ones. As expected, the number of obtained solutions for each case depends on the genomic similarity between the studied microorganisms. Mapping the identified potential drug targets to their corresponding pathways showed the importance of key subsystems such as cell envelope biosynthesis, glycerophospholipid metabolism, membrane lipid metabolism, and the nucleotide salvage pathway. To assist validation and further investigation of our proposed potential drug targets, we introduced two sets of targets that can potentially address a substantial portion of the 665 cases. We expect that the obtained solutions provide helpful insights into designing narrow-spectrum drugs that selectively cause system-wide damage only to the target microorganisms.",

    "abstract": "Foodborne outbreaks caused by fecal contamination of fresh produce represent a serious concern to public health and the economy. As the consumption of fresh produce increases, public health officials and organizations have pushed for improvements in food safety procedures and environmental assessments to reduce the risk of contamination. Visual inspections and the establishment of \"buffer zones\" between animal feeding operations and producing fields are the current best practices for environmental assessments. However, a generalized distance guideline and visual inspections may not be enough to account for all environmental risk variables. Here, we report a baseline measurement surveying the background Bacteroidales concentration, as a quantitative fecal contamination indicator, in Californias Salinas Valley. We collected a total of 1632 samples from two romaine lettuce commercial fields at the time of harvesting through two seasons in a year. The Bacteroidales concentration was very low (0 - 2.00 copies/cm2). Furthermore, we established a practical methodology for evaluating the risk of fecal contamination in a real-world setting, complementing the current environmental assessment practices. This method can identify site-specific risks and offer fresh produce stakeholders a more comprehensive understanding of their fields. We anticipate this work can encourage the use of Bacteroidales in the fresh produce industry to monitor fecal contamination and prevent future foodborne outbreaks.",
