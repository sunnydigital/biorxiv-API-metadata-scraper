    "abstract": "Gas vesicles (GVs) are genetically encoded, air-filled protein nanostructures of broad interest for biomedical research and clinical applications, acting as imaging and therapeutic agents for ultrasound, magnetic resonance, and optical techniques. However, the biomedical applications of GVs as a systemically injectable nanomaterial have been hindered by a lack of understanding of GVs interactions with blood components, which can significantly impact in vivo performance. Here, we investigate the dynamics of GVs in the bloodstream using a combination of ultrasound and optical imaging, surface functionalization, flow cytometry, and mass spectrometry. We find that erythrocytes and serum proteins bind to GVs and shape their acoustic response, circulation time, and immunogenicity. We show that by modifying the GV surface, we can alter these interactions and thereby modify GVs in vivo performance. These results provide critical insights for the development of GVs as agents for nanomedicine.",

    "abstract": "To facilitate analysis and sharing of mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics data we created tools called CURTAIN (https://curtain.proteo.info) and CURTAIN-PTM (https://curtainptm.proteo.info). These enable the non-MS expert to interactively peruse volcano plots; deconvolute primary experimental data to individual replicates that can be visualized in bar charts or violin plots allowing statistical analysis; and export of plots in SVG format. They also permit assessment of experimental quality by correlation matrix and profile plot. Within CURTAIN, the user can analyze domain structure, AlphaFold predicted structure, reported interactors, relative expression, disease and pharmaceutical links, and mutagenesis information on all selected hits. Moreover, CURTAIN-PTM permits the comparison of all identified PTM sites on protein(s) of interest with PTM information contained within selected databases. For phosphorylation site analysis CURTAIN-PTM links with the kinase library to predict upstream kinases that phosphorylate sites of interest. We provide examples of the utility of CURTAIN and CURTAIN-PTM in analyzing how targeted degradation of the PPM1H Rab phosphatase that counteracts the Parkinsons LRRK2 kinase impacts cellular protein levels and phosphorylation sites. We reanalyzed a ubiquitylation dataset, characterizing the PINK1-Parkin pathway activation in primary neurons, revealing new data of interest not highlighted previously. CURTAIN and CURTAIN-PTM are free to use and open-source and will enable researchers to share and maximize the analysis and impact of their proteomics data. We advocate that differential expression proteomic data should be published containing a shareable CURTAIN web-link, allowing readers to better explore their data.\n\nSignificance StatementTo enable non-experts to better share and explore mass spectrometry data, we have generated using open-source software, interactive tools termed CURTAIN and CURTAIN-PTM. These tools enable users to save their analysis sessions with a sharable unique web-link, enabling other researchers to visualize and further analyze these datasets. These links can also be reported in publications allowing readers to further survey the reported data. We discuss benefits for the research community of publishing proteomic data containing a shareable web-link.",

We isolated AMF from two environments and surveyed the surface-sterilized spores for endobacteria. We found that CaMg and CaGg differed significantly in distribution whereby CaMg were extremely abundant (80%) and CaGg were extremely rare (2%) in both environments. Unexpectedly, we discovered an additional and previously unknown level of bacterial diversity within AMF spores which extended beyond the known endosymbionts, with as many as 277 other bacterial taxa detected in individual spores. Detailed analysis of endobacterial communities inside AMF spores revealed that: (i)CaGg were not limited in distribution to the Gigasporacea family of AMF, as previously thought, (ii) CaMg community structure was driven by AMF host genotype, (iii) a significant inverse correlation existed between the diversity of CaMg and diversity of all other endobacteria. The latter suggests the existence of competition dynamics between different bacterial populations inside AMF spores and provides a basis for generation of testable hypotheses regarding the function of CaMg in AMF biology.",

    "abstract": "SummaryCryoEM multi-grid screening is often a tedious process that demands hours of attention. Here, this protocol shows how to set up standard Leginon collection and Smart Leginon Autoscreen to automate this process. This protocol can be applied to the majority of cryoEM holey foil grids.\n\nAdvancements in cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) techniques over the past decade have allowed structural biologists to routinely resolve macromolecular protein complexes to near-atomic resolution. The general workflow of the entire cryoEM pipeline involves iterating between sample preparation, cryoEM grid preparation, and sample/grid screening before moving on to high-resolution data collection. Iterating between sample/grid preparation and screening is typically a major bottleneck for researchers, as every iterative experiment must optimize for sample concentration, buffer conditions, grid material, grid hole size, ice thickness, and protein particle behavior in the ice, amongst other variables. Furthermore, once these variables are satisfactorily determined, grids prepared under identical conditions vary widely in whether they are ready for data collection, so additional screening sessions prior to selecting optimal grids for high-resolution data collection are recommended. This sample/grid preparation and screening process often consumes several dozen grids and days of operator time at the microscope. Furthermore, the screening process is limited to operator/microscope availability and microscope accessibility. Here, we demonstrate how to use Leginon and Smart Leginon Autoscreen to automate the majority of cryoEM grid screening. Autoscreen combines machine learning, computer vision algorithms, and microscope-handling algorithms to remove the need for constant manual operator input. Autoscreen can autonomously load and image grids with multi-scale imaging using an automated specimen-exchange cassette system, resulting in unattended grid screening for an entire cassette. As a result, operator time for screening 12 grids may be reduced to [~]10 minutes with Autoscreen compared to [~]6 hours using previous methods which are hampered by their inability to account for high variability between grids. This protocol and video tutorial first introduces basic Leginon setup and functionality, then demonstrates Autoscreen functionality step-by-step from the creation of a template session to the end of a 12 grid automated screening session.",

Here, we discovered that FAM104A, a protein of unknown function that we named VCF1 (VCP/p97 Cofactor FAM104 1), acts as a novel p97 cofactor in human cells. Detailed structure-function studies revealed that VCF1 directly binds p97 via a conserved novel -helical motif that recognizes the p97 N-domain with unusually high affinity, exceeding that of other cofactors. We show that VCF1 engages in joint p97 complex formation with the heterodimeric primary p97 cofactor UFD1-NPL4 and promotes p97-UFD1-NPL4-dependent proteasomal degradation of ubiquitylated substrates in cells. Mechanistically, VCF1 indirectly stimulates UFD1-NPL4 interactions with ubiquitin conjugates via its binding to p97 but has no intrinsic affinity for ubiquitin. Collectively, our findings establish VCF1 as an unconventional p97 cofactor that promotes p97-dependent protein turnover by facilitating p97-UFD1-NPL4 recruitment to ubiquitylated targets.",

    "abstract": "The skin of Xenopus embryos contains numerous multiciliated cells (MCCs), which collectively generate a directed fluid flow across the epithelial surface essential for distributing the overlaying mucous. MCCs develop into highly specialized cells to generate this flow, containing approximately 150 evenly spaced centrioles that give rise to motile cilia. MCC-driven fluid flow can be impaired when ciliary dysfunction occurs, resulting in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) in humans. Mutations in a large number of genes ([~]50) have been found to be causative to PCD. Recently, studies have linked low levels of Adenylate Kinase 7 (AK7) gene expression to patients with PCD; however, the mechanism for this link remains unclear. Additionally, AK7 mutations have been linked to multiple PCD patients. Adenylate kinases modulate ATP production and consumption, with AK7 explicitly associated with motile cilia. Here we reproduce an AK7 PCD-like phenotype in Xenopus and describe the cellular consequences that occur with manipulation of AK7 levels. We show that AK7 localizes throughout the cilia in a DPY30 domain-dependent manner, suggesting a ciliary function. Additionally, we find that AK7 overexpression increases centriole number, suggesting a role in regulating centriole biogenesis. We find that in AK7-depleted embryos, cilia number, length, and beat frequency are all reduced, which in turn, significantly decreases the tissue-wide mucociliary flow. Additionally, we find a decrease in centriole number and an increase in sub-apical centrioles, implying that AK7 influences both centriole biogenesis and docking, which we propose underlie its defect in ciliogenesis. We propose that AK7 plays a role in PCD by impacting centriole biogenesis and apical docking, ultimately leading to ciliogenesis defects that impair mucociliary clearance.",

Here, we identify the hitherto uncharacterized FAM104 proteins as a conserved family of p97 interactors. FAM104 proteins bind p97 directly via a novel, alpha-helical motif and associate with the p97- UFD1-NPL4 complex in cells. FAM104 proteins localize to the nucleus and promote both the nuclear import and chromatin binding of p97. Loss of FAM104 proteins results in slow growth and hypersensitivity to p97 inhibition in the absence and presence of DNA damage, suggesting that FAM104 proteins are critical regulators of nuclear p97 functions.",

    "abstract": "The genomes of close unicellular relatives of animals encode orthologs of many genes that regulate animal development. However, little is known about the function of such genes in unicellular organisms or the evolutionary process by which these genes came to function in multicellular development. The Hippo pathway, which regulates cell proliferation and tissue size in animals, is present in some of the closest unicellular relatives of animals, including the amoeboid organism Capsaspora owczarzaki. We previously showed that the Capsaspora ortholog of the Hippo pathway nuclear effector Yorkie/YAP/TAZ (coYki) regulates actin dynamics and the three-dimensional morphology of Capsaspora cell aggregates, but is dispensable for cell proliferation control (Phillips et al., 2022). However, the function of upstream Hippo pathway components, and whether and how they regulate coYki in Capsaspora, remained unknown. Here, we analyze the function of the upstream Hippo pathway kinases coHpo and coWts in Capsaspora by generating mutant lines for each gene. Loss of either kinase results in increased nuclear localization of coYki, indicating an ancient, premetazoan origin of this Hippo pathway regulatory mechanism. Strikingly, we find that loss of either kinase causes a contractile cell behavior and increased density of cell packing within Capsaspora aggregates. We further show that this increased cell density is not due to differences in proliferation, but rather actomyosin-dependent changes in the multicellular architecture of aggregates. Given its well-established role in cell density-regulated proliferation in animals, the increased density of cell packing in coHpo and coWts mutants suggests a shared and possibly ancient and conserved function of the Hippo pathway in cell density control. Together, these results implicate cytoskeletal regulation but not proliferation as an ancestral function of the Hippo pathway and uncover a novel role for Hippo signaling in regulating cell density in a proliferation-independent manner.",

    "abstract": "Gain-of-function mutations in the LRRK2 gene cause Parkinsons disease (PD), characterized by debilitating motor and non-motor symptoms. Increased phosphorylation of a subset of RAB GTPases by LRRK2 is implicated in PD pathogenesis. We find that increased phosphorylation of RAB3A, a cardinal synaptic vesicle precursor (SVP) protein, disrupts anterograde axonal transport of SVPs in iPSC-derived human neurons (iNeurons) expressing hyperactive LRRK2-p.R1441H. Knockout of the opposing protein phosphatase 1H (PPM1H) in iNeurons phenocopies this effect. In these models, the compartmental distribution of synaptic proteins is altered; synaptophysin and synaptobrevin-2 become sequestered in the neuronal soma with decreased delivery to presynaptic sites along the axon. We find that RAB3A phosphorylation disrupts binding to the motor adapter MADD, potentially preventing formation of the RAB3A-MADD-KIF1A/1B{beta} complex driving anterograde SVP transport. RAB3A hyperphosphorylation also disrupts interactions with RAB3GAP and RAB-GDI1. Our results reveal a mechanism by which pathogenic hyperactive LRRK2 may contribute to the altered synaptic homeostasis associated with characteristic non-motor and cognitive manifestations of PD.\n\nSUMMARYDou et al. demonstrate that Parkinsons disease-associated hyperactive LRRK2 decreases trafficking of synaptic vesicle proteins within neurons by disrupting regulation of the synaptic vesicle precursor protein RAB3A.

    "abstract": "The primary cilium is a critical sensory organelle that is built of axonemal microtubules ensheathed by a ciliary membrane. In polarized epithelial cells, primary cilia reside on the apical surface and must extend these microtubules directly into the extracellular space and remain a stable structure. However, the factors regulating cross-talk between ciliation and cell polarization, as well as, axonemal microtubule growth and stabilization in polarized epithelia are not fully understood. In this study, we find TTLL12, a previously uncharacterized member of the Tubulin Tyrosine Ligase-Like (TTLL) family, localizes to the base of primary cilia and is required for cilia formation in polarized renal epithelial cells. We also show that TTLL12 directly binds to the /{beta}-tubulin heterodimer in vitro and regulates microtubule dynamics, stability, and post-translational modifications (PTMs). While all other TTLLs catalyze the addition of glutamate or glycine to microtubule C-terminal tails, TTLL12 uniquely affects tubulin PTMs by promoting both microtubule lysine acetylation and arginine methylation.

    "abstract": "Biomolecular condensates regulate a wide range of cellular functions from signaling to RNA metabolism1, 2, yet, the physiologic conditions regulating their formation remain largely unexplored. Biomolecular condensate assembly is tightly regulated by the intracellular environment. Changes in the chemical or physical conditions inside cells can stimulate or inhibit condensate formation3-5. However, whether and how the external environment of cells can also regulate biomolecular condensation remain poorly understood. Increasing our understanding of these mechanisms is paramount as failure to control condensate formation and dynamics can lead to many diseases6, 7. Here, we provide evidence that matrix stiffening promotes biomolecular condensation in vivo. We demonstrate that the extracellular matrix links mechanical cues with the control of glucose metabolism to sorbitol. In turn, sorbitol acts as a natural crowding agent to promote biomolecular condensation. Using in silico simulations and in vitro assays, we establish that variations in the physiological range of sorbitol, but not glucose, concentrations, are sufficient to regulate biomolecular condensates. Accordingly, pharmacologic and genetic manipulation of intracellular sorbitol concentration modulates biomolecular condensates in breast cancer - a mechano-dependent disease. We propose that sorbitol is a mechanosensitive metabolite enabling protein condensation to control mechano-regulated cellular functions. Altogether, we uncover molecular driving forces underlying protein phase transition and provide critical insights to understand the biological function and dysfunction of protein phase separation.",

In this study, we used travelling waves in the cell cortex to characterize the collective dynamics of cytoskeletal networks. Our findings show that Cdc42 and F-BAR-dependent actin waves in mast cells are mainly driven by formin-mediated actin polymerization, with the microtubule-binding formin FH2 domain-containing protein 1 (FHDC1) identified as an early regulator. The depolymerization of microtubules coincides with the nucleation of actin waves, and the concurrent release of FHDC1 from microtubule is required for actin waves. Lastly, we show the importance of the actin-microtubule linkage mediated by FHDC1 in crucial cellular processes such as cell division and migration. Our data provided molecular insights into the nucleation mechanisms of actin waves and uncover an antagonistic interplay between microtubule and actin polymerization in their collective dynamics.",
