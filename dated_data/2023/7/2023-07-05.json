    "abstract": "Metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGlu1) is a promising therapeutic target for neurodegenerative CNS disorders including spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). Clinical reports have identified naturally-occurring mGlu1 mutations in rare SCA subtypes and clinical symptoms of mGlu1 mutations have been described. However, how mutations alter mGlu1 function remains unknown. We explored SCA-associated mutation effects on mGlu1 cell surface expression and canonical signal transduction. Orthosteric agonists and positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) and negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) were assessed at two functional endpoints (iCa2+ mobilisation and IP1 accumulation). mGlu1 mutants exhibited differential impacts on receptor expression, with a truncating C-terminus mutation significantly reducing mGlu1 expression. Mutations differentially influenced orthosteric ligand affinity, efficacy, and functional cooperativity between allosteric and orthosteric ligands. Loss-of-function mutations L454F and N885del reduced orthosteric affinity and efficacy, respectively. Gain-of-function Y792C mutant mGlu1 displayed enhanced constitutive activity in IP1 assays, which manifested as reduced orthosteric agonist activity. mGlu1 PAMs restored glutamate potency in iCa2+ mobilisation for loss-of-function mutations, and mGlu1 NAMs displayed enhanced inverse agonist activity at Y792C relative to wild-type mGlu1. Collectively, these data highlight distinct mechanisms by which mGlu1 mutations affect receptor function and show allosteric modulators may present a means to restore aberrant mGlu1 function in rare SCA subtypes.",

    "abstract": "Lactobacillus reuteri ATG-F4, human gut-derived bacteria, was orally administrated in a model of hindlimb immobilization and confirmed the muscular performance, muscle mass and mechanism on anti-atrophy study. Concomitantly, the changes in the intestinal flora, the metabolites and cytokines were investigated. In the stapled immobilization mice model, ATG- F4 treated group had significantly increased muscle mass, myofiber size, running time to be exhausted and grip strength. The cytokine levels in serum and muscle tissues were reduced by ATG-F4 treatment. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of proteins involved in muscle synthesis such as mTOR, p70S6K, rpS6 and 4E-BP1 increased and MuRF1 related to muscle atrophy factor reduced in the TA and GA muscles. ATG-F4 treatment changed the ratio of main intestinal microflora by increasing the family Muribaculaceae (phylum Bacteroidetes) and decreasing the family Lachnospiraceae (phylum Firmicutes) and Lactobacillaceae (phylum Firmicutes). Also, the level of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) including butyric acid and acetic acid in the serum of ATG-F4 group were increased. These results suggest that L. reuteri ATG- F4 can inhibit muscle atrophy and it is associated with the microbiota and its metabolites with the anti-inflammation effect. ATG-F4 may be a potential prophylactic or therapeutic composition for muscle atrophy.",

Thymic development is profoundly impaired in the absence of SLP-76 or LAT, but moderately impaired in Gads-deficient mice, which accumulate non-naive (CD44+) peripheral T cells. To better distinguish Gads-dependent and -independent developmental transitions, we performed tamoxifen-induced ablation of Gads (GadsiKO), accompanied by the expression of tdTomato, and compared the co-development of Gads-expressing (Tom-) and -ablated (Tom+) thymocytes within the same mouse. The frequency of GadsiKO (Tom+) thymocytes decreased at Gads-dependent junctures but remained high in Gads-independent lineages. Within the DN compartment, Gads was required for conventional {beta}-selection, but not for the {gamma}{delta} or NKT lineages. GadsiKO DP thymocytes were overwhelmingly CD5-, indicating impaired self peptide-MHC responsiveness; yet exhibited reduced death by neglect. Instead, an aberrant population of CD5- GadsiKO thymocytes progressed as far as the CD4 SP compartment, while lacking key characteristics of positively selected thymocytes. Distinct, CD5+ GadsiKO SP populations were positively-selected and TCR responsive, suggesting that they include one or more Gads-independent developmental lineages. In particular, the development of innate-like NKT cells, CD44+ PLZF+ CD4+ cells, and CD44+ Eomes+ CD8+ cells was favored in the absence of Gads. Our results suggest that Gads regulates thymic development, by promoting conventional {beta} T cell development and death by neglect, while suppressing innate-like thymic developmental fates.\n\nKey pointsGads is differentially required for conventional and innate-like thymic lineages Gads is required to promote death by neglect in unselected DP thymocytes",

    "abstract": "An increase in primary productivity is recorded annually during the southwest monsoon season along the west coast of India, an important upwelling zone. The influence of the seasonal variations in the in-situ primary productivity on the bacterial dynamics and community structure was explored during the non-monsoon and productive monsoon seasons. In the monsoon season, distinct upwelling signals and a significant, positive correlation of bacterial carbon (p < 0.01) with primary productivity was observed. Bacterial diversity was also assessed in the chlorophyll maxima depths during both seasons based on metagenomics analysis. In the non-monsoon season, genera such as Idiomarina, Salinimonas, Marinobacter of Proteobacteria and Bacillus and Lactobacillus of Firmicutes were dominant. These major bacterial genera are shown through CCA to play an important ecological role. They are possibly responsible for the increased heterotrophic activity recorded through predicted functional gene profiles in this season. In the monsoon season, increased abundance in the autotrophic Cyanobacteria community and its photosynthetic activity was recorded in the gene profiles. Higher diversity of heterotrophic phyla such as Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and a few Candidatus phyla and changes in the diversity of Proteobacteria with a representation of Alteromonas, SAR86 clade and OM60 (NOR5) were also observed. These results highlight the bacterial dynamics associated with seasonal variations in primary productivity.",

    "abstract": "Microbiome data analysis faces the challenge of sparsity, with many entries recorded as zeros. In differential abundance analysis, the presence of excessive zeros in data violates distributional assumptions and creates ties, leading to an increased risk of type I errors and reduced statistical power. To address this, we developed a novel normalization method, called CAMP, for microbiome data by treating zeros as censored observations, transforming raw read counts into tie-free time-to-event-like data. This enables the use of survival analysis techniques, like the Cox proportional hazards model, for differential abundance analysis. Extensive simulations demonstrate that CAMP achieves proper type I error control and high power. Applying CAMP to a human gut microbiome dataset, we identify 60 new differentially abundant taxa across geographic locations, showcasing its usefulness. CAMP over-comes sparsity challenges, enabling improved statistical analysis and providing valuable insights into microbiome data in various contexts.",

    "abstract": "Coral-associated microbiomes vary greatly between coral colonies and sampling locations with functional consequences on the coral host. However, the full extent of variability across the ranges of most coral species remains unknown, especially in octocorals and species from mesophotic and deep-sea habitats. Here we characterized the microbiomes of four octocoral species from mesophotic and deep-sea habitats in the northern Gulf of Mexico, Muricea pendula, Swiftia exserta, Callogorgia delta, and Paramuricea biscaya using 16S metabarcoding. We tested for microbiome differentiation between and within species, examining the influence of the corals genotype and environmental factors that vary with depth (53-2224 m) and geographic location (over 680 m). Coral microbiomes were often dominated by a single amplicon sequence variant - ASV (>50% relative abundance) whose abundance varied across the range of the host coral. These included corallicolid apicomplexans, Endozoicomonas, members of the Mollicutes, and the BD1-7 clade of Spongiibacteraceae. Coral species, depth, and geographic location significantly affected microbial community composition, richness, and evenness, as well as the abundance of individual microbes. Differences in bottom temperature and surface primary productivity could explain part of the variation associated with depth and geographic location, respectively. However the coral genotype was confounded with depth so its effect could not be dissected. Altogether, this work demonstrates that the microbiomes of corals vary substantially across their ranges in ways that may have functional consequences, identifies important ecological drivers in mesophotic and deep-sea corals, and can inform restoration efforts.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium parasite resistance to existing antimalarial drugs poses a devastating threat to the lives of many who depend on their efficacy. New antimalarial drugs and novel drug targets are in critical need, along with novel assays to accelerate their identification. Given the essentiality of protein synthesis throughout the complex parasite lifecycle, translation inhibitors are a promising drug class, capable of targeting the disease-causing blood stage of infection, as well as the asymptomatic liver stage, a crucial target for prophylaxis. To identify compounds capable of inhibiting liver stage parasite translation, we developed an assay to visualize and quantify translation in the P. berghei-HepG2 infection model. After labeling infected monolayers with o- propargyl puromycin (OPP), a functionalized analog of puromycin permitting subsequent bioorthogonal addition of a fluorophore to each OPP-terminated nascent polypetide, we use automated confocal feedback microscopy followed by batch image segmentation and feature extraction to visualize and quantify the nascent proteome in individual P. berghei liver stage parasites and host cells simultaneously. After validation, we demonstrate specific, concentration-dependent liver stage translation inhibition by both parasite-selective and pan-eukaryotic active compounds, and further show that acute pre-treatment and competition modes of the OPP assay can distinguish between direct and indirect translation inhibitors. We identify a Malaria Box compound, MMV019266, as a direct translation inhibitor in P. berghei liver stages and confirm this potential mode of action in P. falciparum asexual blood stages.",

    "abstract": "Campylobacter jejuni is a leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide. Acute infection can be antecedent to highly debilitating long-term sequelae. Expression of iron acquisition systems is vital for C. jejuni to survive the low iron availability within the human gut. The C. jejuni fetMP-fetABCDEF gene cluster is known to be upregulated during human infection and under iron limitation. While FetM and FetP have been functionally linked to iron transport in prior work, here we assess the contribution by each of the downstream genes (fetABCDEF) to C. jejuni growth during both iron-depleted and iron-replete conditions. Significant growth impairment was observed upon disruption of fetA, fetB, fetC, and fetD, suggesting a role in iron acquisition for each encoded protein. FetA expression was modulated by iron-availability but not dependent on the presence of FetB, FetC, FetD, FetE or FetF. Functions of the putative thioredoxins FetE and FetF were redundant in iron scavenging, requiring a double deletion ({Delta}fetEF) to exhibit a growth defect. C. jejuni FetE was expressed and the structure solved to 1.50 [A], revealing structural similarity to thiol-disulfide oxidases. Functional characterization in biochemical assays showed that FetE reduced insulin at a slower rate than E. coli Trx and that together, FetEF promoted substrate oxidation in cell extracts, suggesting that FetE (and presumably FetF) are oxidoreductases that can mediate oxidation in vivo. This study advances our understanding of the contributions by the fetMP-fetABCDEF gene cluster to virulence at a genetic and functional level, providing foundational knowledge towards mitigating C. jejuni-related morbidity and mortality.",

    "abstract": "One of the debilitating causes of high mortality in the case of tuberculosis and other bacterial infections is the resistance development against standard drugs. There are limited studies so far to describe how a bacterial second messenger molecule can directly participate in distinctive antibiotic tolerance characteristics of a cell in a mechanism-dependent manner. Here we show that intracellular cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP) concentration can modulate drug sensitivity of Mycobacterium smegmatis by directly interacting with either a protein effector or with the 5-UTR regions in mRNA of the genes and thus causing transcriptional downregulation of important genes in the pathways. We studied four antibiotics with different mechanisms of action: rifampicin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, and tobramycin and subsequently found that the level of drug sensitivity of the bacteria is directly proportional to the c-di-AMP concentration inside the cell. Further, we unraveled the underlying molecular mechanisms to delineate the specific genes and pathways regulated by c-di-AMP and hence result in differential drug sensitivity in M. smegmatis. Thus, our findings of c-di-AMP messenger controlling drug resistance phenotypes of mycobacteria against four different classes of antibiotics is a unique observation that will contribute to scientific advancement in the field.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryHere we describe how second messenger c-di-AMP modulates the antibiotic sensitivity and resistance profile of M. smegmatis by diverse mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The pheromone MAPK is essential for the vital activities of fungi and is widely identified in filamentous fungi of agricultural, medical, and industrial relevance. The targets have rarely been reported and it is difficult to understand the mechanism of pheromone MAPK signaling pathway. Aflatoxins (AFs), highly carcinogenic natural products, are produced by the secondary metabolism of fungi, such as Aspergillus flavus. Our previous studies demonstrated that Fus3 regulates AFs by modulating substrate levels in Aspergillus flavus, but no mechanism explain that in fungi. Here we show Gal83, a new target of Fus3, and identified the pheromone Fus3-MAPK signaling pathway regulates the Snf1/AMPK energy-sensing pathway to modulate aflatoxins synthesis substrates. In the screening for target proteins of Fus3, the Snf1/AMPK complexes {beta} subunit was identified by using tandem affinity purification and multi-omics, which physically interacted with Fus3 in vivo and vitro and received phosphorylation from Fus3. While neither aflatoxin transcript levels were down-regulated in gal83-mutant and fus3-mutant strains, significant decreases in aflatoxin B1, aflatoxin synthetic substrates levels and gene expression levels of primary metabolic enzymes were shown that both the Fus3-MAPK and Snf1/AMPK pathways could response energy signal. In conclusion, all the evidence unlocks a novel pathway of Fus3-MAPK to regulate AFs synthesis substrates by cross-talking to the Snf1/AMPK complexes.\n\nImportanceAflatoxin poses a great threat to human and animal health and the economy, thus the mechanisms regulating aflatoxin synthesis have been of great interest. We have previously demonstrated that MAPK regulates aflatoxin biosynthesis significantly, but the regulatory mechanism of Fus3-MAPK is not clear. Here we found that Pheromone Fus3-MAPK responds to energy and transmits to Snf1/AMPK through phosphorylation, which regulates the level of secondary metabolic substrates in Aspergillus flavus, as a novel pathway of Fus3-MAPK. Fus3 interacts stably with Gal83 and colocalizes in the cytoplasm and nucleus, directly regulating the levels of aflatoxin synthetic substrates. These data advance our understanding of the regulation of aflatoxin by pheromone MAPK, and the mechanism of pheromone MAPK and Snf1/AMPK crosstalk regulation is confirmed. Overall, this has a positive effect on both fungal regulatory mechanisms and aflatoxin prevention and control.",

    "abstract": "The initiation of protein translation, one of the four phases of translation, had been proved to be the rate limiting step for translation. The specific interaction of bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit with Shine-Dalgarno sequence (SD) contributes the initiation significantly. It had been shown that SD-like sequence in coding region of mRNA, designated as internal SD, can direct translation initiation as regular SD does. The ribosome impediments were demonstrated to be one of the factors contributing the non-uniform translation elongation rate, but their effects on internal SD translation initiation role (ISTIR) remains unclear. To investigate effects of upstream ribosome impediments on ISTIR, a fragment consisting of pyruvate kinase (PK) gene, translation initiation needed mRNA elements (including an A/U-rich region, SD sequence and start codon AUG) and red fluorescent protein (RFP) gene was constructed and RFP expression levels representing translation initiation efficiency induced by internal SD was analyzed. Surprisingly, RFP expression was not detected with this primary construct, further experiments of inclusion of stem loop structure preceding to internal SD or co-expression of engineered RNA binding scaffold (ERBS) targeting to preceding sequence of internal SD could activate ISTIR. These results suggest that upstream ribosome impediments would activate ISTIR to initiate the downstream gene translation, which manifests the potential for developing new method to test interactions between RNA binding proteins and their target RNA molecules in vivo.",

Activation increases pseudoexon inclusion in mRNA and interferes with normal gene expression. The PCCA c.1285-1416A>G variation activates a pseudoexon and causes the severe metabolic disorder, propionic acidemia, by deficiency of the propionyl-CoA carboxylase enzyme encoded by PCCA and PCCB. We characterized this pathogenic pseudoexon activation event in detail and identified hnRNP A1 to be important for normal repression. The PCCA c.1285-1416A>G variation disrupts an hnRNP A1-binding splicing silencer and simultaneously creates a splicing enhancer. We demonstrate that blocking this region of regulation with splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides restores normal splicing and rescues enzyme activity in patient fibroblasts and in a cellular model created by CRISPR gene editing. The PCCA pseudoexon can be exploited as a gene-regulatory switch, as healthy tissues show relatively high levels of inclusion. By blocking inclusion of the non-activated wild type pseudoexon, we increase both PCCA and PCCB protein levels, which increases the activity of the heterododecameric enzyme. Surprisingly, we can increase enzyme activity from residual levels not only in patient fibroblasts harboring PCCA missense variants, but also those harboring PCCB missense variants. This could be a potential treatment strategy for propionic acidemia.",

The challenges of experimental structural determination and the diversity of the immune repertoire underscore the necessity of accurate computational tools for modeling antibody-antigen complexes.

We show the importance of bound-like component modeling in complex assembly accuracy, and that the current version of AlphaFold improves near-native modeling success to over 30%, versus approximately 20% for a previous version. With this improved success, AlphaFold can generate accurate antibody-antigen models in many cases, while additional training may further improve its performance.",

    "abstract": "In many animal species, elevated cAMP-PKA signaling initiates oocyte meiotic maturation upon hormonal stimulation, whereas in vertebrates, it acts as a negative regulator of this process. To address this \"cAMP paradox\", we have focused on ARPP19 proteins. Dephosphorylation of Xenopus ARPP19 on a specific PKA site has been identified as a key step in initiating oocyte maturation. We first tracked evolution of the ARPP19 PKA phosphorylation site, revealing that it appeared early during the emergence of metazoans. This contrasts with strong conservation across eukaryotes of a phosphorylation site for the kinase Gwl in ARPP19 proteins, able to transform them into potent PP2A-B55 inhibitors and thus promote M-phase entry. We then compared the phosphorylation and function of Xenopus ARPP19 with its orthologue from the jellyfish Clytia, a model species showing cAMP-induced oocyte maturation. We confirmed that Clytia ARPP19 is phosphorylated on the conserved Gwl site in vitro as well as in maturing Xenopus and Clytia oocytes, behaving as a PP2A inhibitor and contributing to Cdk1 activation. However, Gwl-phosphorylated ARPP19 was unable to initiate oocyte maturation in Clytia, suggesting the presence of additional locks released by hormonal stimulation. Clytia ARPP19 was in vitro phosphorylated by PKA uniquely on the predicted site, but it was a much poorer substrate of PKA and of its antagonizing phosphatase, PP2A-B55{delta}, than the Xenopus protein. Correspondingly, PKA-phosphomimetic Clytia ARPP19 had a much weaker inhibitory activity on meiosis resumption in Xenopus oocytes than its Xenopus counterpart. Hence, poor recognition of Clytia ARPP19 by PKA and the absence of its targets in Clytia oocytes account for the cAMP paradox. This cross-species study of ARPP19 illustrates how initiation of oocyte maturation has complexified during animal evolution, and provides further insight into its biochemical regulation.",

    "abstract": "Although sex determination is ubiquitous in vertebrates, mechanisms of sex determination vary from environmentally- to genetically-influenced. Genetic sex determination is typically accomplished with sex chromosomes via the presence/absence of a specific allele at a genetic locus, which initiates the sex determination signaling network. In vertebrates, well-studied groups like mammals and birds maintain conserved sex chromosome systems (XY and ZW, respectively), while sex chromosomes in many other clades may not be conserved across long evolutionary timeframes. Among squamate reptiles, for example, some groups are relatively stable, like iguanids (Pleurodonta), caenophidian snakes (Caenophidia), and lacertids (Lacertidae) while others are highly variable in their modes of sex determination, such as geckos (Gekkota) and the clade containing chameleons and dragon lizards (Acrodonta). One group inferred to have an evolutionarily stable mode of sex determination is the Anguimorpha, a clade of charismatic taxa, including monitor lizards (Varanus), beaded lizards (Heloderma), glass lizards (Ophisaurus), and the crocodile lizard (Shinisaurus crocodilurus). The most recent common ancestor to extant anguimorphs possessed a ZW system that has been retained across the clade. However, determination of sex chromosomes in some anguimorph species has remained elusive including in the endangered, monotypic family of crocodile lizards (Shinisauridae). Here, we use a combination of whole genome re-sequencing and RADseq to demonstrate that S. crocodilurus has replaced the ancestral anguimorph ZW system on their LG7 chromosome with a novel ZW system on LG3. The syntenic region that corresponds with this linkage group in chicken is chromosome 9, and this is the first documented use of this syntenic block as a sex chromosome in amniotes. Additionally, this [~]1Mb region harbors approximately 10 genes, including a duplication of the well-characterized transcription factor, Foxl2--a critical locus for the maintenance of sexual differentiation in vertebrates, and thus a putative primary sex determining gene for S. crocodilurus.",

    "abstract": "Uncovering the regulators of cellular aging will unravel the complexity of aging biology and identify potential therapeutic interventions to delay the onset and progress of chronic, aging-related diseases. In this work, we systematically compared gene sets involved in regulating the lifespan of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (a powerful model organism to study the cellular aging of humans) and those with expression changes under rapamycin treatment. Among the functionally uncharacterized genes in the overlap set, YBR238C stood out as the only one downregulated by rapamycin and with an increased chronological and replicative lifespan upon deletion. We show that YBR238C and its paralogue RMD9 oppositely affect mitochondria and aging. YBR238C deletion increases the cellular lifespan by enhancing mitochondrial function. Its overexpression accelerates cellular aging via mitochondrial dysfunction. We find that the phenotypic effect of YBR238C is largely explained by HAP4- and RMD9-dependent mechanisms. Further, we find that genetic or chemical-based induction of mitochondrial dysfunction increases TORC1 (Target of Rapamycin Complex 1) activity that, subsequently, accelerates cellular aging. Notably, TORC1 inhibition by rapamycin (or deletion of YBR238C) improves the shortened lifespan under these mitochondrial dysfunction conditions in yeast and human cells. The growth of mutant cells (a proxy of TORC1 activity) with enhanced mitochondrial function is sensitive to rapamycin whereas the growth of defective mitochondrial mutants is largely resistant to rapamycin compared to wild type. Our findings demonstrate a feedback loop between TORC1 and mitochondria (the TORC1-MItochondria-TORC1 (TOMITO) signaling process) that regulates cellular aging processes. Hereby, YBR238C is an effector of TORC1 modulating mitochondrial function.",

    "abstract": "In-solution hybridisation enrichment of genetic variation is a valuable methodology in human paleogenomics. It allows enrichment of endogenous DNA by targeting genetic markers that are comparable between sequencing libraries. Many studies have used the 1240k reagent--which enriches 1,237,207 genome-wide SNPs--since 2015, though access was restricted. In 2021, Twist Biosciences and Daicel Arbor Biosciences independently released commercial kits that enabled all researchers to perform enrichments for the same 1240k SNPs. We used the Daicel Arbor Biosciences Prime Plus kit to enrich 132 ancient samples from three continents. We identified a systematic assay bias that increases genetic similarity between enriched samples and that cannot be explained by batch effects. We present the impact of the bias on population genetics inferences (e.g., Principal Components Analysis, [f]-statistics) and genetic relatedness (READ). We compare the Prime Plus bias to that previously reported of the legacy 1240k enrichment assay. In [f]-statistics, we find that all Prime-Plus-generated data exhibit artefactual excess shared drift, such that within-continent relationships cannot be correctly determined. The bias is more subtle in READ, though interpretation of the results can still be misleading in specific contexts. We expect the bias may affect analyses we have not yet tested. Our observations support previously reported concerns for the integration of different data types in paleogenomics. We also caution that technological solutions to generate 1240k data necessitate a thorough validation process before their adoption in the paleogenomic community.",

    "abstract": "The emergence and spread of Salmonella Typhi resistant to third generation cephalosporins are a serious global health concern. In this study, we have genomically characterized twelve cephalosporin resistant S. Typhi strains isolated from India. Comparative genome analysis of study isolates revealed the emergence of a new clone of ceftriaxone-resistant S. Typhi containing three plasmids of the incompatibility group IncFIB(K), IncX1 and IncFIB(pHCM2). Among the three, IncFIB(K) plasmid confers resistance to third-generation cephalosporins by means of blaCTX-M-15 gene, as well as other resistance determinants such as aph(3\"), aph(6), sul2, dfrA14 and tetA. Phylogenetic analysis of strains revealed that a single isolate belongs to a clade corresponding to genotype 4.3.1 and isolates from Ahmedabad (n=11) belong to a distinct subclade within genotype 4.3.1.2 (H58 lineage II). SNP-based phylogenetic analysis of the core genes in IncFIB(K) revealed the plasmid backbone is closely related to that of IncFIB(K) from other Enterobacterales. The findings suggest that H58 lineage II can acquire MDR plasmids from other Enterobacteriales if compensatory evolution balances the cost of carrying the plasmids. Though, like previously reported, exposure to the third generation cephalosporins during the treatment may have selected these variants, this could indicate the beginning of a new wave of ceftriaxone resistant S. Typhi in India. The implementation of control measures such as vaccination, improved water, sanitation, etc., could be undertaken in areas where MDR or XDR S Typhi strains are prevalent.",

    "abstract": "Mucin 1 (MUC1) is a transmembrane mucin expressed at the apical surface of epithelial cells at different mucosal surfaces including breast and intestine. In the gastrointestinal tract, MUC1 has a barrier function against bacterial invasion, but can also serve as an entry receptor for pathogenic Salmonella bacteria. Moreover, MUC1 is well known for its aberrant expression and glycosylation in adenocarcinomas The MUC1 extracellular domain contains a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) of 20 amino acids, which are heavily O-linked glycosylated.. Monoclonal antibodies against the MUC1 VNTR can be powerful tools because of their multiplicity of binding and possible applications in the diagnosis and treatment of MUC1-expressing cancers. One such antibody is the hybridoma mouse monoclonal 139H2, which is also widely used as a research tool to study non-cancer MUC1. Here we report direct mass spectrometry-based sequencing of hybridoma-derived 139H2 IgG, which enabled reverse engineering of a recombinant 139H2. The performance of the reverse engineered 139H2 IgG and its Fab fragment were validated by comparison to the hybridoma-derived product in Western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy. The reverse engineering of 139H2 allowed us to characterize binding to the VNTR peptide epitope by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and solve the crystal structure of the 139H2 Fab fragment in complex with the MUC1 VNTR peptide. These analyses reveal the molecular basis for 139H2 binding specificity to MUC1 and its tolerance to O-glycosylation of the VNTR. The available sequence of 139H2 will allow further development of MUC1-related diagnostics, targeting and treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "Hyperactive interferon (IFN) signaling is a hallmark of Down syndrome (DS), a condition caused by trisomy 21 (T21); strategies that normalize IFN signaling could benefit this population. Mediator-associated kinases CDK8 and CDK19 drive inflammatory responses through incompletely understood mechanisms. Using sibling-matched cell lines with/without T21, we investigated Mediator kinase function in the context of hyperactive IFN in DS. Using both targeted and unbiased, discovery-based approaches, we identified new and diverse mechanisms by which Mediator kinases regulate IFN signaling. Beyond effects on IFN-stimulated transcripts, we discovered that CDK8/CDK19 impact splicing, revealing a novel means by which Mediator kinases control gene expression. Kinase inhibition altered splicing in pathway-specific ways and selectively disrupted IFN-responsive gene splicing in T21 cells. Moreover, Mediator kinase inhibition blocked cytokine responses to IFN{gamma} and severely impacted core metabolic pathways, including up-regulation of anti-inflammatory lipid signaling molecules during IFN{gamma}-stimulation. These lipids included ligands for nuclear receptors and G-protein coupled receptors that can act in an autocrine or paracrine manner, suggesting additional kinase-dependent mechanisms to durably suppress IFN{gamma} responses, beyond initial changes in gene expression. Collectively, our results establish that Mediator kinase inhibition antagonizes IFN{gamma} signaling through transcriptional, metabolic, and cytokine responses, with implications for DS and other chronic inflammatory conditions.\n\nSignificanceAs Mediator-associated kinases, CDK8 and CDK19 are established regulators of RNA polymerase II transcription; however, the \"downstream\" biochemical impacts of CDK8/CDK19 inhibition have not been thoroughly examined. We previously showed that CDK8 and CDK19 help activate transcriptional responses to the universal cytokine IFN{gamma}; others have demonstrated that Down syndrome (DS) is characterized by hyperactive IFN{gamma} signaling, which contributes to DS-associated pathologies. Here, we discovered CDK8/CDK19 inhibition drives \"downstream\" metabolic changes that can reinforce and propagate anti-inflammatory responses independent of transcription. We also identified a new means by which CDK8/CDK19 regulate gene expression, via alternative splicing, and inhibition selectively impacted IFN{gamma} response genes. Collectively, our results establish that Mediator kinase inhibition antagonizes hyperactive IFN signaling in DS, suggesting novel therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "According to the WHO, one in three people in the world has a latent tuberculosis infection. Tuberculosis is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb). The development of multi-drug resistant (MDR) tuberculosis indicates a need for novel treatments. Hence, it is important to find a second line of treatment for patients infected with MDR tuberculosis. The proteasome is known to be necessary for survival under stress and pathogenicity in M.tb. However, our ability to use the proteasome as drug target has been limited by our abilities to screen for inhibitor compounds in vitro. The proteasome is a protease complex that degrades proteins and is crucial for the maintenance of protein homeostasis within cells. Like many protein complexes, the proteasome must assemble into a specific quaternary structure in order to be active. Specifically, the proteolytically-active proteasome Core Particle (CP) consists of 28 subunits (14  and 14 {beta}) that must assemble into a barrel-like structure in order to become catalytically active. Hence, understanding the assembly process in not only important from a basic cell biological perspective, but may also serve as the basis for the discovery of novel assembly inhibitors. In this study, we have established for the first time a protocol to express and purify the M.tb  and {beta} subunits separately in vitro. The subunits are soluble monomers on purification and only assemble into active CPs upon reconstitution. Our assembly experiments revealed that M.tb CP assembly pathway is almost certainly identical to that seen in previous experiments on the CP from the bacterium Rhodococcus erythropolis (R.e), but assembly in M.tb is much slower. Interestingly, we found that subunits from M.tb and R.e spontaneously self-assembled into active hybrid proteasomes on reconstitution with each other, despite having only 65% sequence similarity. Our work thus strongly suggests that the CP assembly pathway is conserved across bacteria, and the ability to perform in vitro assembly experiments on the M.tb proteasome opens up the possibility of performing critical experiments, including screening for potential molecules that could inhibit assembly, directly in this clinically-relevant organism.",

The millisecond temporal resolution of iSCAT allows us to capture the transient interactions and to observe the dynamics of unlabeled DNA binding to a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) surface in solution for extended periods (including a fraction of 6%, of trajectories lasting longer than 100 ms). Using a Focused Ion Beam (FIB) technique to engineer defects, we find that DNA binding affinity is enhanced at defects; when exposed to long lanes, DNA binds preferentially at lane edges. Overall, we demonstrate that iSCAT imaging is a useful tool to study how biomolecules interact with 2D materials, a key component in engineering future biosensors.",
