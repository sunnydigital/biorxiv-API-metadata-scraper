    "abstract": "Brucella species are facultative intracellular bacterial pathogens causing the contagious zoonotic disease brucellosis. Brucella spp. infect a wide range of animals, including livestock, wild animals, and marine mammals. Brucellosis remains endemic in various parts of the world, affecting the economic growth of many countries due to its impact on public health and livestock productivity. There are no human vaccines for brucellosis, and antibiotic treatment remains inefficient. The existing animal vaccines have many disadvantages, including their residual virulence and infectivity to humans. Compared to other invasive bacterial pathogens, minimal information is available on the virulence factors of Brucella that enable them to survive in the host. Here, we performed a transposon-based random mutagenesis of B. neotomae that identified the arginine-ornithine transporter, ArgT as the crucial virulence determinant of Brucella. Deleting ArgT from B. melitensis resulted in its attenuation in macrophages, which was restored upon complementation with the ArgT expression plasmid. Furthermore, Brucella infection upregulated the host arginine transporter CAT2B expression in the macrophages. We observed that macrophages infected with {Delta}ArgT-Brucella produced elevated levels of nitric oxide due to the inability of {Delta}ArgT Brucella to deplete the host intracellular arginine through its transporter. Further, a defective survival of {Delta}ArgT B. melitensis was observed in the infected mice, which correlated with enhanced nitric oxide production in the infected mice. Our studies revealed that ArgT in Brucella plays a vital role in preventing intracellular killing and contributing to the chronic persistence of Brucella in the host. This information will help to develop improved preventive and therapeutic strategies for animal and human brucellosis.\n\nIMPORTANCE OF THE STUDYBrucella species are infectious intracellular bacterial pathogens causing the worldwide zoonotic disease, brucellosis, affecting animal and human health globally. There is no human vaccine for brucellosis, and antibiotic treatment is often inefficient. Brucella infects various phagocytes, but the mechanism by which Brucella resists intracellular killing remains obscure. Using a transposon-based mutagenesis screening, we identified that arginine/ornithine transporter, ArgT plays a vital role in the intracellular survival of Brucella. The ArgT knock-out Brucella exhibited an attenuated phenotype in macrophages and mice, which correlated with elevated levels of nitric oxide. Our experimental data suggest that depletion of intracellular arginine through ArgT decreases nitric oxide production and protects Brucella from intracellular killing. This information provides crucial leads to developing improved vaccines for brucellosis.",

    "abstract": "While the co-existence of comammox bacteria with canonical nitrifiers is well documented in diverse ecosystems, there is still a dearth of knowledge about the mechanisms underpinning their interactions. Understanding these interaction mechanisms is important as they may play a critical role in governing nitrogen biotransformation in natural and engineered ecosystems. In this study, we tested the ability of two environmentally relevant factors (nitrogen source and availability) to shape interactions between strict ammonia and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria and comammox bacteria in continuous flow column reactors. The composition of inorganic nitrogen species in reactors fed either ammonia or urea was similar during the lowest nitrogen loading condition (1 mg-N/L), but higher loadings (2 and 4 mg-N/L) promoted significant differences in nitrogen species composition and nitrifier abundances. The abundance and diversity of comammox bacteria were dependent on both nitrogen source and loading conditions as multiple comammox bacterial populations were preferentially enriched in the urea-fed system. In contrast, their abundance was reduced in response to higher nitrogen loadings in the ammonia-fed system likely due to ammonia-based inhibition. The preferential enrichment of comammox bacteria in the urea-fed system could be associated with their ureolytic activity calibrated to their ammonia oxidation rates thus minimizing ammonia accumulation to inhibitory levels. However, an increased abundance of comammox bacteria was not associated with a reduced abundance of nitrite oxidizers in the urea-fed system while a negative correlation was found between them in the ammonia-fed system; the latter dynamic likely emerging from reduced availability of nitrite to strict nitrite oxidizers at low ammonia loading conditions.\n\nImportanceNitrification is an essential biological process in drinking water and wastewater treatment systems for managing nitrogen and protecting downstream water quality. The discovery of comammox bacteria and their detection alongside canonical nitrifiers in these engineered ecosystems has made it necessary to understand the environmental conditions that regulate their abundance and activity relative to other better-studied nitrifiers. This study aimed to evaluate two important factors that could potentially influence the behavior of nitrifying bacteria, and therefore impact nitrification processes. Colum reactors fed with either ammonia or urea were systematically monitored to capture changes in nitrogen biotransformation and the nitrifying community as a function of influent nitrogen concentration, nitrogen source, and reactor depth. Our findings show that comammox bacterial abundance decreased and that of nitrite oxidizers increased with increased ammonia availability, while their abundance and diversity increased with increasing urea availability without driving a reduction in the abundance of canonical nitrifiers.",

    "abstract": "Meningiomas are the most common primary intracranial tumors1-3. Treatments for patients with meningiomas are limited to surgery and radiotherapy, and systemic therapies remain ineffective or experimental4,5. Resistance to radiotherapy is common in high-grade meningiomas6, and the cell types and signaling mechanisms driving meningioma tumorigenesis or resistance to radiotherapy are incompletely understood. Here we report NOTCH3 drives meningioma tumorigenesis and resistance to radiotherapy and find NOTCH3+ meningioma mural cells are conserved across meningiomas from humans, dogs, and mice. NOTCH3+ cells are restricted to the perivascular niche during meningeal development and homeostasis and in low-grade meningiomas but are expressed throughout high-grade meningiomas that are resistant to radiotherapy. Integrating single-cell transcriptomics with lineage tracing and imaging approaches across mouse genetic and xenograft models, we show NOTCH3 drives tumor initiating capacity, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and resistance to radiotherapy to increase meningioma growth and reduce survival. An antibody stabilizing the extracellular negative regulatory region of NOTCH37,8 blocks meningioma tumorigenesis and sensitizes meningiomas to radiotherapy, reducing tumor growth and improving survival in preclinical models. In summary, our results identify a conserved cell type and signaling mechanism that underlie meningioma tumorigenesis and resistance to radiotherapy, revealing a new therapeutic vulnerability to treat meningiomas that are resistant to standard interventions.",

Muscle soreness, squat jumps, chair rises and creatine kinase (CK) were measured at pre, post, 24h, 48h, 7 and 14d. Blood lactate (pre, post), 10 cytokines (pre, 24h, 48h, 7d) and oestradiol (pre, 7d) were also measured.\n\nResultsWithout supplementation post-exercise, soreness was induced in both males (6-fold) and females (5-fold). With supplementation, there were no increases in CK or oestradiol in females and no impact on muscle soreness, performance, or function in both sexes. In males, CK was elevated in untreated (48%) and leucine (69%) conditions vs baseline, but these were suppressed with HMB and BCAA. IL-7 was elevated in females vs males at baseline (6.3-fold), leucine increased IL-7 concentrations in females at 24h (17.0-fold), 48h (5.1-fold) vs males. With HMB, TNFr1- increased in females at 24h (2.2-fold), 48h (2.3-fold) and 7d (2.3-fold) vs males.

    "abstract": "Protein copy numbers constrain systems-level properties of regulatory networks, but absolute proteomic data remain scarce compared to transcriptomics obtained by RNA sequencing. We addressed this persistent gap by relating mRNA to protein statistically using best-available data from quantitative proteomics-transcriptomics for 4366 genes in 369 cell lines. The approach starts with a central estimate of protein copy number and hierarchically appends mRNA-protein and mRNA-mRNA dependencies to define an optimal gene-specific model that links mRNAs to protein. For dozens of independent cell lines and primary prostate samples, these protein inferences from mRNA outmatch stringent null models, a count-based protein-abundance repository, and empirical protein-to-mRNA ratios. The optimal mRNA-to-protein relationships capture biological processes along with hundreds of known protein-protein interaction complexes, suggesting mechanistic relationships are embedded. We use the method to estimate viral-receptor abundances of CD55-CXADR from human heart transcriptomes and build 1489 systems-biology models of coxsackievirus B3 infection susceptibility. When applied to 796 RNA sequencing profiles of breast cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas, inferred copy-number estimates collectively reclassify 26% of Luminal A and 29% of Luminal B tumors. Protein-based reassignments strongly involve a pharmacologic target for luminal breast cancer (CDK4) and an -catenin that is often undetectable at the mRNA level (CTTNA2). Thus, by adopting a gene-centered perspective of mRNA-protein covariation across different biological contexts, we achieve accuracies comparable to the technical reproducibility limits of contemporary proteomics. The collection of gene-specific models is assembled as a web tool for users seeking mRNA-guided predictions of absolute protein abundance (http://janeslab.shinyapps.io/Pinferna).\n\nSignificance statementIt is easier to quantify mRNA in cells than it is to quantify protein, but proteins are what execute most cellular functions. Even though protein is synthesized from mRNA in cells, relating a cellular quantity of mRNA to a quantity of protein is challenging. Here, we bring together quantitative measures of mRNA and protein for 4366 genes in 369 different cultured cell types to build equations that predict protein abundance from the abundance of mRNAs expressed. These equations capture facets of biological regulation and work better than existing alternatives that rely on consensus values or ratios. Since mRNA measurements are more widespread than protein, this study makes new analyses possible by protein estimation from mRNA.",

    "abstract": "Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas) is the causal agent of the devastating citrus Huanglongbing (HLB) disease. Our understanding of the pathogenicity mechanism and biology of CLas remain limited because CLas has not been cultured in artificial media. CLas encodes 1136 proteins of which 415 have unknown functions. Since genetic studies of CLas genes with unknown functions are impossible, we utilized genome-wide protein-protein interactions (PPIs) yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) assays to help solve the mystery. PPIs are fundamental to all cellular processes and machinery and instrumental in investigating uncharacterized proteins and inferring biological pathways. In total, 916 bait and 936 prey proteins were included in the three-phase screening, which identified 4245 interactions. The false positive rate of the Y2H assay was estimated to be 3.1%. Pull-down assays confirmed the robustness of our Y2H. The average interactions per node for CLas Y2H interactome were approximately 15.6, significantly higher than free-living bacteria, indicating genome reduction has led to a multi-function of proteins. PPIs provide clues for functions of 371 uncharacterized proteins of CLas. Forty HUB node proteins were identified which might play critical roles in CLas, including a quinone oxidoreductase and LysR that are known to protect bacteria against oxidative stress. This explains why CLas survives well in the phloem even though it triggers immune-mediated disease, systemic and chronic production of reactive oxygen species, and phloem cell death. This PPI database facilitates the investigation of CLas cellular biochemistry and physiology, functions of uncharacterized proteins, and pathogenicity mechanisms of the pathogen.",

    "abstract": "SO_SCPLOWUMMARYC_SCPLOWTime is a key variable in biology. Conceptual and methodological advances focused recent studies of timing in biological systems on monitoring trait dynamics in singled individuals. Here we contribute to this effort by analyzing general properties of individual timeseries. We make four broad claims. First, we show that for traits that range from behavior in animals, to growth in plants, to division timing in cell lineages, faster timeseries tend to be comprised of consistently shorter sub-stages, not a few unusually fast sub-stages. We demonstrate that this property constitutes a particular type of scaling that can be readily detected by a straightforward comparison of absolute and relative variability within timeseries data for any trait. We show that correlations within timeseries are necessary and sufficient for the type of scaling we describe and infer that the ubiquitous occurrence of scaling results from natural correlations within the continuous processes that govern trait dynamics. Second, failing to observe scaling indicates a break in correlation and, we argue, a switch in the mechanisms underlying the rate of trait change. Third, we caution that analyses of individual timeseries are highly susceptible to batch effects, but contend that it is possible to detect signal despite the artifactual correlations introduced by batching. Finally, we show that the timing of biological process that scale is overdispersed compared to matched but uncorrelated comparisons; this is an advantage in variable environments. Our results advance understanding of common properties of biological timeseries and offer practical tools for their further study.",

We found that, by placing mutations into their cellular context, multi-scale agent- based mathematical models could predict how genetic events combine in haematological malignancies. Simulations of lymphoma and myeloma predicted co-occurring mutations synergised to increase tumour cell expansion beyond what would be expected from the impact of the individual mutations alone. Mutational synergy between MYC and BCL2 was consistent with the more aggressive disease course of patients with double-hit lymphoma, and mutational synergy between MCL1 and CKS1B was predictive of outcome in patients with gain 1q multiple myeloma. Incorporating patient-specific mutational profiles into personalised models of lymphoma patients with the worst clinical outcomes revealed a correlation between simulated mutational synergy and overall survival, which outperformed widely used classifications of lymphoma informed by gene expression or mutational data alone. Our results demonstrated that mutational synergy scores enabled prediction of the impact of co-occurring mutations and may improve personalised prognostic predictions.",

This species was described in 2002 based solely on morphology, but several characters crucial for the reliable diagnosis of species in Allobates were not considered. Our results show that A. gasconi sensu stricto is not a member of the A. caeruleodactylus clade as previously claimed, but is a member of the A. trilineatus clade. Allobates gasconi is readily distinguished from congeners by a combination of morphological and bioacoustic characters; a revised diagnosis is provided. The type series of A. gasconi comprises more than one species, and we exclude a paratype from lower Jurua River. The species is restricted geographically to flooded environments in the middle and upper Jurua River in Brazil and in the Ucayali River in Peru. The initial misidentification, subsequent absence of topotypic molecular and acoustic data, and the poor preservation condition of the type series have contributed to taxonomic confusion since A. gasconi was first described.

    "abstract": "The ability to use sparse evidence to produce adaptive responses in new contexts and to new stimuli (inductive generalisation) is central to biological and artificial intelligence. Young and inexperienced animals require very little evidence to generalise, raising the question of whether the neonate brain is evolutionarily prepared (predisposed) for generalisation. To understand the principles of spontaneous generalisation, we exposed neonate chicks to an artificial social partner of a specific colour, and measured generalisation by comparing responses to novel and familiar stimuli along either the red-yellow or the blue-green colour continuum. Generalisation responses were inconsistent with an unbiased model, showing biases such as asymmetrical generalisation gradients, faster learning for particular colours (red and blue over yellow and green), preferences for unfamiliar stimuli and different time courses in learning. Moreover, the chicks generalisation behaviour was consistent with a Bayesian theoretical model that explicitly incorporates predispositions as initial preferences and treats the learning process as an update of spontaneous preferences. These results show that neonate animals are evolutionarily prepared for generalisation, via biases that do not depend on experience, reinforcement or supervision. Biases that facilitate generalisation are tuned to distinctive features that are unusual in the natural environment, such as the red and blue colours. Predispositions facilitate or hinder learning in the inexperienced brain, determining how experience is used to update the likelihood of predictive models. Neonate animals use spontaneous biases to solve the problem of induction.",

    "abstract": "Postnatal regulation of dendritic spine formation and refinement in cortical pyramidal neurons is critical for excitatory/inhibitory balance in neocortical networks. Recent studies have identified a selective spine pruning mechanism in the mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC) mediated by class 3 Semaphorins and the L1-CAM cell adhesion molecules Neuron-glia related CAM (NrCAM), Close Homolog of L1 (CHL1), and L1. L1-CAMs bind Ankyrin B (AnkB), an actin-spectrin adaptor encoded by Ankyrin2 (ANK2), a high confidence gene for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In a new inducible mouse model (Nex1Cre-ERT2: Ank2flox: RCE), Ank2 deletion in early postnatal pyramidal neurons increased spine density on apical dendrites in PFC layer 2/3 of homozygous and heterozygous Ank2-deficient mice. In contrast, Ank2 deletion in adulthood had no effect on spine density. Sema3F-induced spine pruning was impaired in cortical neuron cultures from AnkB-null mice and was rescued by re-expression of the 220 kDa AnkB isoform but not 440 kDa AnkB. AnkB bound to NrCAM at a cytoplasmic domain motif (FIGQY1231), and mutation to FIGQH inhibited binding, impairing Sema3F-induced spine pruning in neuronal cultures. Identification of a novel function for AnkB in dendritic spine regulation provides insight into cortical circuit development, as well as potential molecular deficiencies in ASD.",

The aim of this study was to explore the temporal dynamics and complexity of electroencephalog-raphy (EEG) microstates in relation to attentional engage-ment over time, contributing to the understanding of speech perception in noise. We examined three listening condi-tions: speech perception with background noise, focused attention on the background noise, and intentional disre-gard of the background noise. Our findings revealed an increase in complexity during the transition of microstates and a slower microstate recurrence when individuals directed their attention to speech compared to tasks without speech. Additionally, a two-stage time course for both microstate complexity and alpha-to-theta power ratio was observed. Specifically, in the early epochs, a lower level was observed, which gradually increased and eventually reached a steady level in the later epochs. The findings suggest that the ini-tial stage is primarily driven by sensory processes and infor-mation gathering, while the second stage involves higher-level cognitive engagement, including mnemonic binding and memory encoding.",

    "abstract": "Microsaccades are small, involuntary eye movements that occur during fixation and play a crucial role in maintaining visual stability and attentional focus. Microsaccade inhibition (MSI) refers to the abrupt suppression of microsaccades, typically evoked within 0.1 second after new stimulus onset. The functional significance and neural underpinnings of MSI are subjects of ongoing research. It has been hypothesised that MSI is a component of the brains attentional re-orienting network which facilitates the allocation of attention to new environmental occurrences by reducing disruptions or shifts in gaze that could interfere with processing.\n\nThe extent to which MSI is reflexive or influenced by top-down mechanisms remains debated. We developed a task that specifically examines the impact of auditory top-down attention on MSI, allowing us to disentangle ocular dynamics from visual sensory processing. Participants (N=24 and 27; both sexes) listened to two simultaneous streams of tones and were instructed to attend to one stream while detecting specific task \"targets.\" We quantified MSI in response to occasional task-irrelevant events presented in both the attended and unattended streams (frequency steps in Experiment 1, omissions in Experiment 2).\n\nThe results show that initial stages of MSI are not affected by auditory attention. However, later stages ([~]0.25s post-event onset), affecting the extent and duration of the inhibition, are enhanced for sounds in the attended stream compared to the unattended stream. These findings provide converging evidence for the reflexive nature of early MSI stages and robustly demonstrate the involvement of auditory attention in modulating the later stages.\n\nSignificance StatementMicrosaccades are rapid eye movements occurring during fixation. Their precise role is not known but a major hypothesis is that they reflect automatic sampling of the environment. A feature of microsaccades is that they exhibit abrupt suppression (MSI) after the presentation of new stimuli. This is thought to be part of attentional re-orienting. To understand the neural circuit that controls MSI, and by extension, the brains response to novel events in the environment, it is essential to determine which factors affect MSI. We show, for the first time, that auditory attention affects the latter (but not initial) stages of MSI. Thus, the early stages of MSI are automatic, but subsequent phases are affected by the perceptual state of the individual.",

    "abstract": "The sparse coding hypothesis has successfully predicted neural response properties of several sensory brain areas. For example, sparse basis representations of natural images match edge-detecting receptive fields observed in simple cells of primary visual cortex (V1), and sparse representations of natural sounds mimic auditory nerve waveforms. SAILnet, a leaky integrate-and-fire network model (\"Sparse and Independently Local network\") has previously been shown to learn simple V1 receptive fields when trained on natural images. Experimental work rewiring visual input to auditory cortex found that auditory neurons developed visual response properties, suggesting that developmental rules may be shared across sensory cortices.\n\nIn this work we adapt SAILnet to train it on waveforms of auditory sounds and learn temporal receptive fields (filters), in contrast with previous work that trained SAILnet or other network models on spectrograms. In our model network of primary auditory cortex (A1) neurons receive synaptic current from input neurons who temporally filter the direct sound waveforms. To show the network learns frequency-dependent filters naturally, we do not parametrize the temporal filters, and only restrict the total number of time points in the filters. To make training feasible, we simplify the model to a single input neuron and 768 A1 neurons, and we train the network on \"lo-fi\" music, whose spectral power is limited to frequencies of[~] 10, 000 Hz or less, giving a manageable temporal resolution of the stimulus and filters. The learned filters develop distinct frequency preferences, and reconstruction of novel stimuli captures the low-frequency content of signals in reasonable detail, with audio playback capturing clear aspects of the original stimulus. Lastly, our work also has a pedagogical benefit: the learned stimulus features can be played as sounds, which aids in teaching sensory coding to learners with visual impairments who cannot perceive stimulus features learned by V1 models.",

In a model of the neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disease, GM1-gangliosidosis, pathogenic accumulation of GM1 at ER-PM junctions due to {beta}-galactosidase deficiency drastically alters neuronal Ca2+ homeostasis. Mechanistically, we show that GM1 interacts with the phosphorylated NMDAR Ca2+ channel, thereby increasing Ca2+ flux, activating ERK signaling, and increasing the number of synaptic spines without increasing synaptic connectivity. Thus, GM1 clustering at ER-PM junctions alters synaptic plasticity and exacerbates the generalized neuronal cell death characteristic of GM1-gangliosidosis.",

    "abstract": "Anaerobic cultivation of fecal microbiota is a promising approach to investigate how gut microbial communities respond to specific intestinal conditions and perturbations. Here, we describe a practical protocol using 96-deepwell plates to cultivate stool-derived gut microbiota. Our protocol addresses key challenges in high-throughput culturing, including a thorough assessment of the impact of gas phase on medium chemistry, a modular medium preparation process to enable testing of several conditions in parallel, a medium formulation designed to maximize the compositional similarity of fecal cultures with the donor microbiota, and the creation of a step-by-step protocol detailing all practical procedures from material preparation to sample handling for analyses. Finally, we validated the protocol by demonstrating that cultivated fecal microbiota responded similarly to dietary fibers (resistant dextrin, soluble starch) and drugs (ciprofloxacin, 5-fluorouracil) as reported in vivo. This high-throughput cultivation protocol can facilitate culture-dependent studies, accelerate the discovery of gut microbiota-diet-drug-host interactions, and pave the way to personalized and microbiota-centered interventions.\n\nMOTIVATIONThe human gut microbiota is a complex ecosystem unique to each individual. The extent of this diversity has limited our capacity to fully comprehend microbial dynamics that apply to the entire human population. To probe the response of donor-specific microbial communities to intestinal conditions or perturbations, in vitro cultivation of stool-derived gut microbiota can be employed. However, cultivating gut microbiota under strictly anaerobic conditions is commonly performed using individual gas-tight tubes, which is a highly time-consuming strategy that limits the number of conditions and donor microbiota that can be tested in parallel. A flexible high-throughput protocol to cultivate and test donor-specific gut microbiota is therefore required. Hence, we developed a robust procedure for cultivating stool-derived microbiota (and pure gut microbial cultures) in 96-deepwell plates within an anaerobic chamber.",

Two quality-control mechanisms, the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) and the release of mitochondria-derived vesicles, safeguard mitochondrial proteostasis.

Here we show that the E3 ligase CRL5Ozz, a member of the UPS, and its substrate Alix control the mitochondrial concentration of Slc25A4, a solute carrier that is essential for ATP production. The mitochondria in Ozz-/- or Alix-/-skeletal muscle share overt morphologic alterations (they are supernumerary, swollen, and dysmorphic) and have abnormal metabolomic profiles. We found that CRL5Ozz ubiquitinates Slc25A4 and promotes its proteasomal degradation, while Alix facilitates SLC25A4 loading into exosomes destined for lysosomal destruction. The loss of Ozz or Alix offsets steady-state levels of Slc25A4, which disturbs mitochondrial metabolism and alters muscle fiber composition. These findings reveal hitherto unknown regulatory functions of Ozz and Alix in mitochondrial proteostasis.",

    "abstract": "Members of the phylum Nucleocytoviricota, also called \"giant viruses\" due to their large physical dimensions and genome lengths, are a diverse group of dsDNA viruses that infect a wide range of eukaryotic hosts. Nucleocytoviruses likely evolved from smaller viruses, but the timing of their emergence and its relationship to the early evolution of eukaryotes remains unclear. Recent work has shown that the genomes of nucleocytoviruses often encode Eukaryotic Signature Proteins (ESPs) - including histones, vesicular trafficking factors, cytoskeletal components, and elements of RNA and DNA processing - that occur only rarely outside of eukaryotes. To investigate patterns of gene exchange between viruses and eukaryotes and possibly shed light on the early evolution of both, we examined the occurrence of viral-encoded ESPs (vESPs) and performed a comprehensive phylogenetic reconstruction on a subset that are widespread in nucleocytoviruses. Our results demonstrate that vESPs involved in cytoskeletal structure, ubiquitin system, and vesicular trafficking were acquired multiple times independently by nucleocytoviruses at different timepoints after the emergence of the eukaryotic supergroups. In contrast, vESPs involved in DNA and RNA processing are placed deep in their respective phylogenies, indicative of ancient gene exchange between nucleocytoviruses and eukaryotes. Examination of vESPs that could be rooted in archaea revealed that nucleocytoviruses likely acquired some of these genes prior to the emergence of the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA). Importantly, our findings also suggest that the eukaryotic delta DNA polymerase was acquired from nucleocytoviruses sometime during eukaryogenesis, underscoring the importance of viruses for early eukaryotic evolution. Collectively, these results suggest that gene exchange between nucleocytoviruses and eukaryotes played important roles in the evolution of both prior to the emergence of LECA.",

    "abstract": "Genomic time-series from experimental evolution studies and ancient DNA datasets offer us a chance to more directly observe the interplay of various evolutionary forces. Here we show how the genome-wide variance in allele frequency change between two time points can be decomposed into the contributions of gene flow, genetic drift, and linked selection. In closed populations, the contribution of linked selection is identifiable because it creates covariances between time intervals, and genetic drift does not. However, repeated gene flow between populations can also produce directionality in allele frequency change, creating covariances. We show how to accurately separate the fraction of variance in allele frequency change due to admixture and linked selection in a population receiving gene flow. We use two human ancient DNA datasets, spanning around 5,000 years, as time transects to quantify the contributions to the genome-wide variance in allele frequency change. We find that a large fraction of genome-wide allele frequency change is due to gene flow. In both cases, after correcting for known major gene flow events in those populations, we do not observe a signal of genome-wide linked selection. Thus despite the known role of selection in shaping long-term polymorphism levels, and an increasing number of examples of strong selection on single loci and polygenic scores from ancient DNA, it appears to be gene flow and drift, and not selection, that are the main determinants of recent genome-wide allele frequency change. Our approach should be applicable to the growing number of contemporary and ancient temporal population genomics datasets.",

    "abstract": "In vertebrates, there are two known mechanisms by which meiotic recombination is directed to the genome: in humans, mice, and other mammals, recombination occurs almost exclusively where the protein PRDM9 binds, while in species lacking an intact PRDM9, such as birds and canids, recombination rates are elevated near promoter-like features. To test if PRDM9 also directs recombination in non-mammalian vertebrates, we focused on an exemplar species, the corn snake (Pantherophis guttatus). Unlike birds, this species possesses a single, intact PRDM9 ortholog. By inferring historical recombination rates along the genome from patterns of linkage disequilibrium and identifying crossovers in pedigrees, we found that PRDM9 specifies the location of recombination events outside of mammals. However, we also detected an independent effect of promoter-like features on recombination, which is more pronounced on macrothan microchromosomes. Thus, our findings reveal that the uses of PRDM9 and promoter-like features are not mutually-exclusive, and instead reflect a tug of war, which varies in strength along the genome and is more lopsided in some species than others.\n\nOne sentence summaryWhile the localization of meiotic recombination in vertebrates was previously thought to occur using one of two distinct mechanisms, our analysis of recombination in corn snakes reveals that they and likely other vertebrates use both of these mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "With the sustained popularity of hazy IPAs, brewers have explored multiple approaches to maximizing stable haze that will remain in suspension throughout the shelf life of the beer. Our recent investigations into yeast-dependent haze have uncovered specific brewing yeast strains that promote the formation of haze in heavily dry-hopped beer styles. These brewing strains have been termed \"haze-positive\" and furthermore, the timing of dry hop additions has been found to be another key factor in producing this stable haze. Classical genetics have identified YIL169C (herein referred to as HZY1) as both necessary and sufficient for the haze-positive phenotype in the yeast strain most widely used for Hazy IPAs. HZY1 encodes a candidate glycoprotein and our recent findings suggest it is localized to the cell wall through a GPI anchor. Surprisingly, using long-read sequencing data we uncovered extensive genetic variation in HZY1 across brewing strains. The haze-positive phenotype correlates with an expansion in the N-terminal serine-rich region. We propose that the Hzy1 glycoprotein is a critical component to yeast-dependent colloidal haze and the genetic variation in this locus contributes the range of haze phenotypes observed across industrial brewing strains.",

    "abstract": "As highly labile structures on both individual and evolutionary time-scales, the mushroom bodies, a key site of learning and memory in insects, are an excellent model for investigating the evolution of cognitive variation. We explored the behavioural consequences of mushroom body expansion in Heliconius butterflies, which possess greatly expanded mushroom bodies relative to their closest outgroups. We conducted long-term visual memory assays across three Heliconius and three other Heliconiini species using trained food-colour associations. We confirm robust differences between clades, with Heliconius exhibiting greater fidelity to the trained colour after 8 days without reinforcement compared to other Heliconiini, with further evidence of stable preferences at 13 days. We extended this analysis to consider the plastic response of the mushroom body calyces over this time period, measuring the volume of the mushroom body calyx, and the number of neurons and synapses it contains. We find substantial post-eclosion expansion and synaptic pruning in calyx of Heliconius erato, but not in Dryas iulia. In Heliconius erato, visual associative learning experience specifically is associated with a greater retention of calyceal synapses. At an individual level, fidelity to the trained colour in Heliconius erato was also positively correlated with synapse number. These results point to an enhanced visual long-term memory across Heliconius, facilitated not only by phylogenetic expansion of the mushroom body, but also changes in its developmental response to learning experience. The co-evolution of mushroom body expansion, plasticity and specific behaviours provides an important case study in the evolution of cognition.\n\nSignificance StatementHow are cognitive differences between species supported by evolutionary changes in the brain? We investigated this question using Heliconius butterflies which have expanded mushroom bodies, a region of the insect brain involved in learning and memory. We show that Heliconius have more stable visual long-term memories and exhibit more substantial age- and experience-related plasticity than a closely related genus with smaller mushroom bodies. Recall accuracy was also predicted by synapse number in Heliconius erato, but not Dryas iulia, suggesting functional importance. These results suggest that increases in the size of specific brain regions and changes in their plastic response to experience may co-evolve to shape the evolution of cognition.",

    "abstract": "MotivationDeep sequencing of antibody and related protein libraries after phage or yeast-surface display sorting is widely used to identify variants with increased affinity, specificity and/or improvements in key biophysical properties. Conventional approaches for identifying optimal variants typically use the frequencies of observation in enriched libraries or the corresponding enrichment ratios. However, these approaches disregard the vast majority of deep sequencing data and often fail to identify the best variants in the libraries.\n\nResultsHere, we present a method, Position-Specific Enrichment Ratio Matrix (PSERM) scoring, that uses entire deep sequencing datasets from pre- and post-selections to score each observed protein variant. The PSERM scores are the sum of the site-specific enrichment ratios observed at each mutated position. We find that PSERM scores are much more reproducible and correlate more strongly with experimentally measured properties than frequencies or enrichment ratios, including for multiple antibody properties (affinity and non-specific binding) for a clinical-stage antibody (emibetuzumab). We expect that this method will be broadly applicable to diverse protein engineering campaigns.\n\nAvailabilityAll deep sequencing datasets and code to do the analyses presented within are available via GitHub.\n\nContactPeter Tessier, ptessier@umich.edu\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in cancer genomics have highlighted aberrant expression of various families of non-coding RNAs in all cancer types, including lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD). Here we aim to better understand the functions of long non coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulated by the hypoxic response in LUAD cells, conditions that promote tumor aggressiveness and drug resistance. We performed a single-cell CRISPR-interference-based (CRISPRi) transcriptome screening (CROP-Seq) for HIF1A, HIF2, and a subset of lncRNA candidates regulated by hypoxia and/or potentially associated with LUAD prognosis. The mini-CROP-seq library of validated guides RNA (gRNA) was amplified and transduced in A549 LUAD cells cultured in normoxia or exposed to hypoxic conditions during 3, 6 or 24 hours. To overcome the challenge of detecting subtle gRNA-induced transcriptomic perturbation and classifying the most responsive cells, we used a new supervised autoencoding neural networks method (SAE), leveraging on both transcriptomic data and cell labels corresponding to known received gRNA. We first validated the SAE approach on HIF1A and HIF2 by confirming the specific effect of their knock-down during the temporal switch of the hypoxic response. Next, the SAE method was able to detect stable short hypoxia-dependent transcriptomic signatures induced by the knock-down of some lncRNA candidates, outperforming previously published machine learning approaches. This proof of concept demonstrates the relevance of the SAE approach for deciphering weak perturbations in single-cell transcriptomic data readout as part of CRISPR-based screening.",

    "abstract": "Empirical data relating body mass to defense against infections remain limited. Recent studies have led to the Safety Factor hypothesis, which proposes that larger organisms must evolve stronger immune defenses because they carry greater risks of exposure to pathogens and parasites. Using RNAseq on blood from nine primate species exposed to bacterial lipopolysaccharides, we fit phylogenetic models and discovered hypermetric scaling in innate immune gene responses. We speculate that immune allometries may lead to asymmetrical expectations for virulence of zoonotic pathogens, such that diseases originating in smaller species may cause more severe immunopathology in larger species. This study contributes to the growing body of research on immune allometry, highlighting its importance in understanding the complex interplay between body size and immunity over evolutionary timescales.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryImmune genes are expressed disproportionately more in large than small primate species in response to simulated infection.",
