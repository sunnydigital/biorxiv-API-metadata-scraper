    "abstract": "Leukemia cutis or leukemic cell infiltration in skin is one of the common extramedullary manifestations of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and signifies a poorer prognosis. However, its pathogenesis and maintenance remain understudied. Here, we report massive AML cell infiltration in the skin in a transplantation-induced MLL-AF9 AML mouse model. These AML cells could regenerate AML post-transplantation. Prospective niche characterization revealed that skin harbored mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) with a similar phenotype as BM mesenchymal stem cells. These skin MPCs protected AML-initiating stem cells (LSCs) from chemotherapy in vitro partially via mitochondrial transfer. Furthermore, Lama4 deletion in skin MPCs promoted AML LSC proliferation and chemoresistance. Importantly, more chemoresistant AML LSCs appeared to be retained in Lama4-/- mouse skin post-cytarabine treatment. Our study reveals the characteristics and previously unrecognized roles of skin mesenchymal niches in maintaining and protecting AML LSCs during chemotherapy, meriting future exploration of their impact on AML relapse.\n\nA 40-word summary\n\nSandhow et al have in transplantation-induced AML mouse models demonstrated the leukemia-regenerating capacity of AML cells infiltrated in the skin and the role of skin mesenchymal niches in maintaining/protecting AML cells, providing new insight into the pathology of leukemia cutis.",

    "abstract": "Studying small effects or subtle neuroanatomical variation requires large-scale sample size data. As a result, combining neuroimaging data from multiple datasets is necessary. Variation in acquisition protocols, magnetic field strength, scanner build, and many other non-biologically related factors can introduce undesirable bias into studies. Hence, harmonization is required to remove the bias-inducing factors from the data. ComBat is one of the most common methods applied to features from structural images. ComBat models the data using a hierarchical Bayesian model and uses the empirical Bayes approach to infer the distribution of the unknown factors. The empirical Bayes harmonization method is computationally efficient and provides valid point estimates. However, it tends to underestimate uncertainty. This paper investigates a new approach, fully Bayesian ComBat, where Monte Carlo sampling is used for statistical inference. When comparing fully Bayesian and empirical Bayesian ComBat, we found Empirical Bayesian ComBat more effectively removed scanner strength information and was much more computationally efficient. Conversely, fully Bayesian ComBat better preserved biological disease and age-related information while performing more accurate harmonization on traveling subjects. The fully Bayesian approach generates a rich posterior distribution, which is useful for generating simulated imaging features for improving classifier performance in a limited data setting. We show the generative capacity of our model for augmenting and improving the detection of patients with Alzheimers disease. Posterior distributions for harmonized imaging measures can also be used for brain-wide uncertainty comparison and more principled downstream statistical analysis. Code for our new fully Bayesian ComBat extension is available at https://github.com/batmanlab/BayesComBat.",

    "abstract": "Sexual behaviour is necessary for procreation for several species and is traditionally viewed to be regulated by sex steroid hormones. However, several species exhibit steroid-independent sexual behaviour, and its molecular understanding is only beginning to be uncovered. The main goal of our experiment was to provide new insight into cell-specific roles that both neuronal and non-neuronal cells may play in steroid-independent male sexual behaviour. Forty B6D2F1 hybrid male mice underwent orchidectomy and were tested for reinstatement of steroid-independent male sexual behaviour after an extended period of social isolation caused by the COVID-19-mandated laboratory shutdown. After 62 weeks post-orchidectomy, 20.59% demonstrated reinstatement of steroid-independent male sexual behaviour (identified as  steroid-independent persistent maters), while 23.53% of the males did not display steroid-independent male sexual behaviour (identified as  steroid-independent non-maters). Using flow cytometry, we compared the preoptic area immunoexpression in NeuN+ neurons and Iba1+ microglia between steroid-independent persistent maters and steroid-independent non-maters (N = 5-6 per group). We found neuronal immunoexpression up-regulated for amyloid precursor protein and androgen receptor, as well as down-regulated for glucocorticoid receptor in steroid-independent persistent maters compared to steroid-independent non-maters. In conjunction, microglial immunoexpression of amyloid precursor protein was up-regulated in steroid-independent persistent maters compared to steroid-independent non-maters. These data suggest there are cell-specific immunoexpression differences, including the role of non-neuronal cells in steroid-independent male sexual behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis is a global concern due to its high prevalence in developing countries and the ability of mycobacteria to develop resistance to current treatment regimens. In this project, we propose the use of QSAR (Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships) modeling as a means to identify and evaluate the inhibitory activity of candidate molecules for molecular improvement stages and/or in vitro assays. This approach allows for in silico estimation, reducing research time and costs. To achieve this, we utilized the SAR (Structure-Activity Relationships) study conducted by He, Alian, and Montellano (2007), which focused on a series of arylamides tested as inhibitors of the enzyme enoyl-ACP-reductase (InhA) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We developed both the Hansh-Fujita (classical) and CoMFA (Comparative Molecular Field Analysis) QSAR models. The classical QSAR model produced the most favorable statistical results using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). It achieved an internal validation correlation factor R2 of 0.9012 and demonstrated predictive quality with a Stone-Geisser indicator Q2 of 0.8612. External validation resulted in a correlation factor R2 of 0.9298 and Q2 of 0.720, indicating a highly predictive mathematical model. The CoMFA Model obtained a Q2 of 0.6520 in internal validation, enabling the estimation of energy fields around the molecules. This information is crucial for molecular improvement efforts. We constructed a library of small molecules, analogous to those used in the SAR study, and subjected them to the classic QSAR function. As a result, we identified ten molecules with high estimated biological activity. Molecular docking analysis suggests that these ten analogs, identified by the classical QSAR model, exhibit favorable estimated free energy of binding. In conclusion, the QSAR methodology proves to be an efficient and effective tool for searching and identifying promising drug-like molecules.",

    "abstract": "PurposeFunctional understanding of the periaqueductal grey (PAG), a clinically relevant brainstem region, can be advanced using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). However, the PAGs small size and high levels of physiological noise are methodologically challenging. This study aimed to (1) improve 1H-MRS quality in the PAG using spectral registration for frequency and phase error correction, (2) investigate whether spectral registration is particularly useful in cases of greater head motion and (3) examine metabolite quantification using literature-based or individual-based water relaxation times.\n\nMethodsSpectra were acquired in 33 healthy volunteers (50.1 years, SD=17.19, 18 females) on a 3T Philipps MR system using a point-resolved spectroscopy sequence optimized with very selective saturation pulses (OVERPRESS) and voxel-based flip angle calibration (effective volume of interest size: 8.8x10.2x12.2 mm3). Spectra were fitted using LCModel and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), N-acetylaspartate peak linewidths and Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) were measured after spectral registration and after minimal frequency alignment.\n\nResultsSpectral registration improved SNR by 5 % (p=0.026, median value post-correction: 18.0) and spectral linewidth by 23 % (p<0.001, 4.3 Hz), and reduced the metabolites CRLBs by 1-15 % (ps<0.026). Correlational analyses revealed smaller SNR improvements with greater head motion (p=0.010) recorded using a markerless motion tracking system. Higher metabolite concentrations were detected using individual-based compared to literature-based water relaxation times (ps<0.001).\n\nConclusionThis study demonstrates high-quality 1H-MRS acquisition in the PAG using spectral registration. This shows promise for future 1H-MRS studies in the PAG and possibly also other clinically relevant brain regions with similar methodological challenges.",

    "abstract": "In many situations it is behaviorally relevant for an animal to respond to co-occurrences of perceptual, possibly polymodal features, while these features alone may have no importance. Thus, it is crucial for animals to learn such feature combinations in spite of the fact that they may occur with variable intensity and occurrence frequency. Here, we present a novel unsupervised learning mechanism that is largely independent of these contingencies and allows neurons in a network to achieve specificity for different feature combinations. This is achieved by a novel correlation-based (Hebbian) learning rule which allows for linear weight growth and which is combined with a mechanism for gradually reducing the learning rate as soon as the neurons response becomes feature combination specific. In a set of control experiments, we show that other existing advanced learning rules cannot satisfactorily form such multi-feature representations. In addition, we show that networks, which use this type of learning always stabilize and converge to subsets of neurons with different feature-combination specificity. Neurons with this property may, thus, serve as an initial stage for the processing of ecologically relevant real world situations for an animal.",

    "abstract": "Functional peptides are one kind of short protein fragments that have a wide range of beneficial functions for living organisms. The majority of previous research focused on mono-functional peptides, but a growing number of multi-functional peptides have been discovered. Although enormous experimental efforts endeavor to assay multi-functional peptides, only a small fraction of millions of known peptides have been explored. Effective and precise techniques for identifying multi-functional peptides can facilitate their discovery and mechanistic understanding. In this article, we presented a novel method, called iMFP-LG, for identifying multi-functional peptides based on protein language models (pLMs) and graph attention networks (GATs). Comparison results showed iMFP-LG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both multifunctional bioactive peptides and multi-functional therapeutic peptides datasets. The interpretability of iMFP-LG was also illustrated by visualizing attention patterns in pLMs and GATs. Regarding to the outstanding performance of iMFP-LG on the identification of multi-functional peptides, we employed iMFP-LG to screen novel candidate peptides with both ACP and AMP functions from millions of known peptides in the UniRef90. As a result, 8 candidate peptides were identified, and 1 candidate that exhibits significant antibacterial and anticancer effect was confirmed through molecular structure alignment and biological experiments. We anticipate iMFP-LG can assist in the discovery of multi-functional peptides and contribute to the advancement of peptide drug design.\n\nAvailability and implementationThe models and associated code are available at: https://github.com/chen-bioinfo/iMFP-LG.\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available online.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThis study aimed to compare the effects of three intensities of treadmill running on pain perceptions in healthy individuals. And investigate the role of endogenous pain modulation in the exercise-induced hypoalgesia (EIH) effects.\n\nMethodsSixty-six healthy female individuals were included in this study and were randomly assigned to one of three treadmill running intensities for 35 minutes: 40% of their reserve heart rate (HRR), 55% HRR, or 70% HRR. The EIH effects were assessed by the changes of pressure pain thresholds (PPT) and pressure pain tolerance thresholds (PPTol) at multiple time points. The assessments were conducted prior to the treadmill running session every 5 minutes during the exercise bout, and at 5 minutes, 10 minutes, and 24 hours post-exercise. The conditioned pain modulation (CPM) was also measured to determine the functions of endogenous pain modulation.\n\nResultsCompared with baseline, there was a significant increase of PPT and PPTol at arm and leg in all groups during running and 5-10min follow-ups. The PPT and PPTol changes of moderate and low intensity groups were significantly higher than the high intensity group during running and 24h after running. While the CPM responses of high intensity group were significantly reduced compared with other groups at 24h follow-up.\n\nConclusionModerate and low intensity running may trigger the endogenous descending inhibition and elicit significant EIH effects following running and persisting over 24h. While the high intensity running only induced limited EIH effects for the activation of both descending pain inhibition and facilitation, with reduced CPM responses. Thus, the pain perception changes following exercises may reveal the potential mechanisms of EIH induced via exercises with different intensities.\n\nNew findingsWhat is the central question of this study?\n\nBoth the primary analgesia effect (EIH) and secondary pain allodynia (delayed onset muscle soreness) may occur following exercises, possibly due to the interaction between endogenous pain modulation and exercise intensities. What is the difference in the changes of primary and secondary pain perceptions following exercise with different intensities?\n\nWhat is the main finding and its importance?\n\nModerate and low intensity running induced acute and long-lasting EIH effects via the effective activation of descending inhibition, while the high intensity running may trigger the descending facilitation and attenuate both the acute and long-lasting EIH effects. This result preliminarily explained the non-liner effect of exercise intensity on the acute EIH responds.",

In the classic paradigm, guanine nucleotide binding to the G subunit regulates the activation status of the complex. We sought to develop improved methods for heterologous expression and rapid purification of G subunits. Using GPA1, the sole canonical G subunit of the model plant species, Arabidopsis thaliana, we observed that, compared to conventional purification methods, rapid StrepII-tag mediated purification facilitates isolation of protein with increased GTP binding and hydrolysis activities. This allowed us to identify a potential discrepancy with the reported GTPase activity of GPA1. We also found that human GNAI1 displayed expected binding and hydrolysis activities when purified using our approach, indicating our protocol is applicable to mammalian G subunits, potentially including those for which purification of enzymatically active protein has been historically problematic. We then utilized domain swaps of GPA1 and human GNAO1 to demonstrate that the inherent instability of GPA1 is a function of the interaction between the Ras and helical domains. Additionally, we found that GPA1-GNAO1 domain swaps uncouple the instability from the rapid nucleotide binding kinetics displayed by GPA1.",

A data-driven, model-based approach relating sulcal depth to behavior revealed that the morphology of only a subset of LPC/LPOJ sulci, including the slocs-v, is related to performance on a spatial orientation, but not a relational reasoning task.

One system of great fundamental and practical interest is the condensation of bio-molecules, where the order parameters are concentrations of solutes, and the condensed phase typically contains many different components of diverse properties. In such systems, each solute species corresponds to one dimension in the full phase space and a major challenge in the field is to rigorously interpret and quantify the multi-component character of any given phase separation system. Here, we formulate a dominance parameter D for each solute  in a multi-component system, and show that it is easily accessible in experiments and relates to the underlying thermodynamics and the phase space. We complement the theoretical work with experimental data, and demonstrate that D reflects the interactions driving phase separation. A simple computational model further illuminates the variation of D across the whole phase space. This work paves the way for future quantitative investigations into multi-component systems.",

Recently, organic solvents also served as a delipidation reagent in aqueous-based clearing methods and exhibited very fast clearing speed. To explain the high efficiency of organic solvents, we described the delipidation process of both detergents and organic solvents with a simple diffusion model, we proposed a possible mechanism of the delipidation process of water-miscible polar organic solvents based on the clearing results of brain samples.

    "abstract": "Treatment-refractory severe asthma manifests a neutrophilic phenotype associated with TH17 responses. Heightened unfolded protein responses (UPRs) are associated with the risk of asthma, including severe asthma. However, how UPRs participate in the deregulation of TH17 cells leading to this type of asthma remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the role of the UPR sensor IRE1 in TH17 cell function and neutrophilic airway inflammation. We found that IRE1 is induced in fungal asthma and is highly expressed in TH17 cells relative to naive CD4+ T cells. Cytokine (e.g. IL-23) signals induce the IRE1-XBP1s axis in a JAK2-dependent manner. This noncanonical activation of the IRE1-XBP1s pathway promotes UPRs and cytokine secretion by TH17 cells. Ern1 (encoding IRE1)-deficiency decreases the expression of ER stress factors and impairs the differentiation and cytokine secretion of TH17 cells. Genetic ablation of Ern1 leads to alleviated TH17 responses and airway neutrophilia in a Candida albicans asthma model. Consistently, IL-23 activates the JAK2-IRE1-XBP1s pathway in vivo and enhances TH17 responses and neutrophilic infiltration into the airway. Taken together, our data indicate that IRE1, noncanonically activated by cytokine signals, promotes neutrophilic airway inflammation through the UPR- mediated secretory function of TH17 cells. The findings provide a novel insight into the fundamental understanding of IRE1 in TH17-biased TH2-low asthma.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a global health concern associated with various metabolic disorders including insulin resistance and adipose tissue inflammation characterized by adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) infiltration. In this study, we present a novel Drosophila model to investigate the mechanisms underlying ATM infiltration and its association with obesity-related pathologies. Furthermore, we demonstrate the therapeutic potential of attenuating Eiger/TNF signaling to ameliorate insulin resistance and ATM. To study ATM infiltration and its consequences, we established a novel Drosophila model (OBL) that mimics key aspects of human adipose tissue and allows for investigating ATM infiltration and other related metabolic disorders in a controlled experimental system. We employed genetic manipulation to reduce ecdysone levels to prolong the larval stage. These animals are hyperphagic, and exhibit features resembling obesity in mammals, including increased lipid storage, adipocyte hypertrophy, and high levels of circulating glucose. Moreover, we observed a significant infiltration of immune cells (hemocytes) in the fat bodies accompanied by insulin resistance and systemic metabolic dysregulation. Furthermore, we found that attenuation of Eiger/TNF signaling and using metformin and anti-oxidant bio-products like anthocyanins led to a reduction in ATM infiltration and improved insulin sensitivity.\n\nOur data suggest that the key mechanisms that trigger immune cell infiltration into adipose tissue are evolutionarily conserved and may provide the opportunity to develop Drosophila models to better understand pathways critical for immune cell recruitment into adipose tissue, in relation to the development of insulin resistance in metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We believe that our OBL model can also be a valuable tool and provide a platform either to perform genetic screens or to test the efficacy and safety of novel therapeutic interventions for these diseases.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we designed six peptides based on the characteristics of natural antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), including small size, cationicity, amphipathicity, and -helix structure. The peptides were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity, hemolytic potential, binding affinity to TLR4/MD-2 receptors, and immunomodulatory effects. Five out of the six designed peptides were classified as AMPs, while one peptide was predicted to be a non-antimicrobial peptide (NAMP) by the AxPEP server. The designed peptides exhibited varying degrees of antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with SK1217 and SK1260 demonstrating stronger antimicrobial potential. Hemolytic assays revealed minimal hemolytic activity for SK1203, SK1217, SK1260, and SK1281, indicating a low propensity to cause red blood cell (RBC) lysis. However, SK1286 and SK1283 exhibited significant hemolytic effects at higher concentrations, with SK1286 causing complete hemolysis at 100 g/mL. Molecular docking analysis showed favourable binding affinities of SK1260, SK1217, and SK1286 with TLR4/MD-2 receptors. Furthermore, SK1260 displayed potent immunomodulatory activity, reducing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF- in LPS-stimulated macrophage cells. Cell viability assays demonstrated minimal cytotoxicity of SK1260. In vivo studies on infected mice showed that SK1260 treatment increased leukocyte recruitment and cytokine levels (GM-CSF, INF-g, and MCP-1) in the peritoneal lavage fluid. Overall, these findings highlight the promising potential of these cationic AMPs as antimicrobial and immunomodulatory agents for further therapeutic exploration.",

    "abstract": "Modeling multiscale mechanics in shape-shifting biological tissues in embryos, traditional, or engineered cell culture platforms (organoids, organs-on-chips) is both important and challenging. In fact, it is difficult to model relevant tissue-level structural changes mediated by discrete events at the cellular and subcellular levels, such as migration and proliferation. To accomplish this, we leveraged the subcellular element modeling (SEM) method, where ensembles of coarse-grained particles interacting via empirically defined potentials are used to model individual cells while preserving cell rheology. However, an explicit treatment of multiscale mechanics in SEM was missing. Here, we introduced SEM2, an extended version of the open-source software SEM++ and LAMMPS, enabling new analyses and visualization of particle-level stress and strain. We demonstrated various functionalities of SEM2 by simulating cell creep, migration, and proliferation in scenarios that recapitulate classical and engineered cell culture platforms. For every scenario, we highlight key mechanobiology that emerges spontaneously from particle interactions and discuss recent experimental evidence as qualitative validations of our simulations.

    "abstract": "To survive, animals must meet their biological needs while simultaneously avoiding danger. However, the neurobiological basis of appetitive and aversive survival behaviors has historically been studied using separate behavioral tasks. While recent studies in mice have quantified appetitive and aversive conditioned responses simultaneously (Heinz et al., 2017; Jikomes et al., 2016), these tasks required different behavioral responses to each stimulus. As many brain regions involved in survival behavior process stimuli of opposite valence, we developed a paradigm in which mice perform the same response (nosepoke) to distinct auditory cues to obtain a rewarding outcome (palatable food) or avoid an aversive outcome (mild footshoock). This design allows for both within- and between-subject comparisons as animals respond to appetitive and aversive cues. The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) is implicated in the regulation of responses to stimuli of either valence. Considering its role in threat processing (Haubensak et al., 2010; Wilensky et al., 2006) and regulation of incentive salience (Warlow and Berridge, 2021), it is important to examine the contribution of the CeA to mechanisms potentially underlying comorbid dysregulation of avoidance and reward (Bolton et al., 2009; Sinha, 2008). Using this paradigm, we tested the role of two molecularly defined CeA subtypes previously linked to consummatory and defensive behaviors. Significant strain differences in the acquisition and performance of the task were observed. Bidirectional chemogenetic manipulation of CeA somatostatin (SOM) neurons altered motivation for reward and perseveration of reward-seeking responses on avoidance trials. Manipulation of corticotropin-releasing factor neurons (CRF) had no significant effect on food reward consumption, motivation, or task performance. This paradigm will facilitate investigations into the neuronal mechanisms controlling motivated behavior across valences.\n\nSignificance StatementIt is unclear how different neuronal populations contribute to reward- and aversion-driven behaviors within a subject. To address this question, we developed a novel behavioral paradigm in which mice obtain food and avoid footshocks via the same operant response. We then use this paradigm to test how the central amygdala coordinates appetitive and aversive behavioral responses. By testing somatostatin-IRES-Cre and CRF-IRES-Cre transgenic lines, we found significant differences between strains on task acquisition and performance. Using chemogenetics, we demonstrate that CeA SOM+ neurons regulate motivation for reward, while manipulation of CeA CRF+ neurons had no effect on task performance. Future studies investigating the interaction between positive and negative motivation circuits should benefit from the use of this dual valence paradigm.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundJansen de Vries Syndrome (JdVS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) caused by gain-of-function (GOF) truncating mutations in PPM1D exons 5 or 6. PPM1D is a serine/threonine phosphatase that plays an important role in the DNA damage response (DDR) by negatively regulating TP53 (P53). JdVS-associated mutations lead to the formation of a truncated PPM1D protein that retains catalytic activity and has a GOF effect because of reduced degradation. Somatic PPM1D exons 5 and 6 truncating mutations are well-established factors in a number of cancers, due to excessive dephosphorylation and reduced function of P53 and other substrates involved in DDR. Children with JdVS have a variety of neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, and physical problems. In addition, a small fraction has acute neuropsychiatric decompensation apparently triggered by infection or severe non-infectious environmental stress factors.\n\nMethodsTo understand the molecular basis of JdVS, we developed an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) model system. iPSCs heterozygous for the truncating variant (PPM1D+/tr), were made from a patient, and control lines engineered using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. Proteomics and phosphoprotemics analyses were carried out on iPSC-derived glutamatergic neurons and microglia from three control and three PPM1D+/tr iPSC lines. We also analyzed the effect of the TLR4 agonist, lipopolysaccharide, to understand how activation of the innate immune system in microglia could account for acute behavioral decompensation.\n\nResultsOne of the major findings was the downregulation of POGZ in unstimulated microglia. Since loss-of-function variants in the POGZ gene are well-known causes of autism spectrum disorder, the decrease in PPM1D+/tr microglia suggests this plays a role in the neurodevelopmental aspects of JdVS. In addition, neurons, baseline, and LPS-stimulated microglia show marked alterations in the expression of several E3 ubiquitin ligases, most notably UBR4, and regulators of innate immunity, chromatin structure, ErbB signaling, and splicing. In addition, pathway analysis points to overlap with neurodegenerative disorders.\n\nLimitationsOwing to the cost and labor-intensive nature of iPSC research, the sample size was small.\n\nConclusionsOur findings provide insight into the molecular basis of JdVS and can be extrapolated to understand neuropsychiatric decompensation that occurs in subgroups of patients with ASD and other NDDs.",

We applied FlowCAM-based imaging flow cytometry together with PCR and sequencing to get a comprehensive picture of the seasonal development of Microcystis community in a long-term running lake mesocosm experiment. The IFC analysis with manual taxonomic classification confirmed early findings with a machine learning algorithm that some Microcystis morphospecies completely disappeared and re-appeared along the mesocosm experiment timeline. This observation supports the hypothesis of the main transition pathways of colonial Microcystis. For the first time, colonial mucilaginous envelopes or sheaths were reported as separate entities, and not as a part of Microcystis colonies. The colonial sheaths may contain a few single Microcystis cells and reach significant numbers (thousands) during a cyanobacterial bloom. We also found that non-identifiable colonial small clusters of Microcystis cells are an important stage in the complex mosaic of a Microcystis bloom and are associated with the development of colonial forms. Our findings were validated by the principal component analysis coupled with the constructed associative matrices. We hypothesize that colonial sheaths may be crucial at Microcystis spp. dispersal and represent one of the stages of colonies development.",

Raf kinase-B inhibitor protein (RKIP) and BTB and CNC homology 1 (BACH1) are two proteins reported to influence EMT. In breast cancer, they act antagonistically, but the exact nature of their roles in mediating EMT and associated other axes of plasticity remains unclear. Here, analysing transcriptomic data, we reveal their antagonistic trends in a pan-cancer manner, in terms of association with EMT, metabolic reprogramming and immune evasion via PD-L1. Next, we developed and simulated a mechanism-based gene regulatory network that captures how RKIP and BACH1 engage in feedback loops with drivers of EMT and stemness. We found that RKIP and BACH1 belong to two separate \"teams\" of players - while BACH1 belonged to the one that drove pro-EMT, stem-like and therapy-resistant cell-states, RKIP is a member of a team that enables pro-epithelial, less stem-like and therapy-sensitive phenotypes. Finally, we observed that low RKIP levels and concomitant upregulated BACH1 levels associated with worse clinical outcomes in many cancer types. Together, our systems-level analysis indicates that the emergent dynamics of underlying regulatory network underlie the antagonistic patterns of RKIP and BACH1 with various axes of cancer cell plasticity, as well as with patient survival data.",

    "abstract": "Deviance detection describes an increase of neural response strength caused by a stimulus with a low probability of occurrence. This ubiquitous phenomenon has been reported for multiple species, from subthalamic areas to auditory cortex. While cortical deviance detection has been well characterised by a range of studies covering neural activity at population level (mismatch negativity, MMN) as well as at cellular level (stimulus-specific adaptation, SSA), subcortical deviance detection has been studied mainly on cellular level in the form of SSA. Here, we aim to bridge this gap by using noninvasively recorded auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) to investigate deviance detection at population level in the lower stations of the auditory system of a hearing specialist: the bat Carollia perspicillata. Our present approach uses behaviourally relevant vocalisation stimuli that are closer to the animals natural soundscape than artificial stimuli used in previous studies that focussed on subcortical areas. We show that deviance detection in ABRs is significantly stronger for echolocation pulses than for social communication calls or artificial sounds, indicating that subthalamic deviance detection depends on the behavioural meaning of a stimulus. Additionally, complex physical sound features like frequency- and amplitude-modulation affected the strength of deviance detection in the ABR. In summary, our results suggest that at population level, the bat brain can detect different types of deviants already in the brainstem. This shows that subthalamic brain structures exhibit more advanced forms of deviance detection than previously known.",

    "abstract": "Chemogenetic tools provide an opportunity to manipulate neuronal activity and behavior selectively and repeatedly in nonhuman primates (NHPs) with minimal invasiveness. Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs are one example that is based on mutated muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Another channel-based chemogenetic system available for neuronal modulation in NHPs uses Pharmacologically Selective Actuator Modules (PSAMs), which are selectively activated by Pharmacologically Selective Effector Molecules (PSEMs). To facilitate the use of the PSAM/PSEM system, the selection and dosage of PSEMs should be validated and optimized for NHPs. To this end, we used a multimodal imaging approach. We virally expressed excitatory PSAM (PSAM4-5HT3) in the striatum and the primary motor cortex of two macaque monkeys, and visualized its location through positron emission tomography (PET) with the reporter ligand [18F]ASEM. Chemogenetic excitability of neurons triggered by two PSEMs (uPSEM817 and uPSEM792) was evaluated using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose-PET imaging, with uPSEM817 being more efficient than uPSEM792. Pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging showed that increased brain activity in the PSAM4-expressing region began approximately 13 min after uPSEM817 administration and continued for at least 60 min. Our multimodal imaging data provide valuable information regarding the manipulation of neuronal activity using the PSAM/PSEM system in NHPs, facilitating future applications.\n\nSignificance statementLike other chemogenetic tools, the ion channel-based system called Pharmacologically Selective Actuator Module/Pharmacologically Selective Effector Molecule (PSAM/PSEM) allows remote manipulation of neuronal activity and behavior in living animals. Nevertheless, its application in non-human primates (NHPs) is still limited. Here, we used multi-tracer positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to visualize an excitatory chemogenetic ion channel (PSAM4-5HT3) and validate its chemometric function in macaque monkeys. Our results provide the optimal agonist, dose, and timing for chemogenetic neuronal manipulation, facilitating the use of the PSAM/PSEM system and expanding the flexibility and reliability of circuit manipulation in NHPs in a variety of situations.",

Contrary to current models, Th2 differentiation was associated with enhanced T cell activation and extensive integrin-dependent  macro-clustering at the T-B border, which also contrasted clustering behavior seen during Th1 differentiation. Unexpectedly, formation of Th2 macro-clusters within LNs was highly dependent on the site of skin sensitization. Differences between sites were driven by divergent activation states of migratory cDC2 from different dermal tissues, with enhanced costimulatory molecule expression by cDC2 in Th2-generating LNs promoting T cell macro-clustering and cytokine sensing. Thus, generation of dedicated priming micro-environments through enhanced costimulatory molecule signaling initiates the generation of Th2 responses in vivo and occurs in a skin site-specific manner.",

Reduced levels of factor H (FH), a down-regulator of the alternative pathway, and increased levels of properdin (Factor P/FP), the only known up-regulator of the alternative pathway, have been observed in individuals with severe COVID-19 infection. The present study investigated the complement activation-independent, and a more direct role of FH and FP against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using direct ELISA, the interactions of FH and FP with the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and receptor binding domain (RBD) were assessed. Using S protein expressing lentiviral pseudotypes, the cell binding and luciferase-based virus entry assays were employed to assess the potential modulatory effects of FH, FP, and recombinant thrombospondin repeats 4 and 5 (TSR4+5) on SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. We also evaluated the immunomodulatory functions of FH and FP in the cytokine response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes via RT-qPCR. SARS-CoV-2 S and RBD proteins were found to bind both FH and FP. Treatment of A549 cells expressing human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 with FP or TSR4+5 resulted in increased cell entry and binding of SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes. In silico studies revealed that FP increases affinity between SARS-CoV-2 and host ACE2. The impact of FP on viral cell entry and binding was reversed by anti-FP antibody treatment in A549-hACE2+TMPRSS2 cells. However, FH treatment reduced the cell entry and binding of SARS-CoV-2 lentiviral pseudotypes. Furthermore, the A549-hACE2+TMPRSS2 cells challenged with SARS-CoV-2 spike, envelope, nucleoprotein, and membrane protein expressing alphaviral pseudotypes pre-treated with FP or TSR4+5, exhibited upregulation of the transcripts of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1{beta}, IL-8, IL-6, TNF-, IFN- and RANTES (as well as NF-{kappa}B). Conversely, FH pre-treatment downregulated the expression of these pro-inflammatory cytokines. Treatment of A549-hACE2+TMPRSS2 cells with FP increased S protein-mediated NF-{kappa}B activation, while FH treatment reduced it. These findings suggest that FH may act as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and binding, thereby attenuating the infection-associated inflammatory response in a complement activation-independent manner. FP may contribute to viral cell entry, binding, and exacerbating the immune response. That may result in potentially influencing the severity of the infection.",

    "abstract": "Modeling windborne transmission of aerosolized pathogens is challenging. We adapted an atmospheric dispersion model named Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model (HYSPLIT) to simulate windborne dispersion of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSv) between swine farms and incorporated the findings into an outbreak investigation. The risk was estimated semi-quantitatively based on the cumulative daily deposition of windborne particles, and the distance to closest emitting farm with an ongoing outbreak. Five years of data (2014 : 2018) were used to study seasonal differences of deposition thresholds of the airborne particles containing PRRSv and to evaluate model in relation to risk prediction and barn air filtration. When considered the 14-day cumulative deposition, in Winter, above threshold particle depositions would reach up to 30 km from emitting farms with 84% of them being within 10km. Long-distance pathogen transmission was highest in Winter and Fall, lower in Spring, and least in Summer. The model successfully replicated the observed seasonality of PRRSv where Fall and Winter posing a higher risk for outbreaks. Reaching the humidity and temperature thresholds tolerated by the virus in Spring and Summer reduced the survival and infectivity of aerosols beyond 10 -20 km. Within in the data limitations of voluntary participation, when assumed wind as the sole route of PRRSv transmission, the predictive performance of the model was fair with >0.64 AUC. Barn air filtration was associated with fewer outbreaks, particularly when exposed to high levels of viral particles. The study confirms the usefulness of HYSPLIT models as a tool when determining seasonal effects, distances, and inform near real-time risk of windborne PRRSv transmission that can be useful in future outbreak investigations and implementing timely control measures.",

    "abstract": "Foskett Spring in Oregons desert harbors a historically threatened population of Western Speckled Dace (Rhinichthys klamathensis). Though recently delisted, the daces recruitment depends upon regular removal of encroaching vegetation. Previous studies assumed that Foskett Dace separated from others in the Warner Valley about 10,000 years ago, thereby framing an enigma about the populations surprising ability to persist for so long in a tiny habitat easily overrun by plants. To investigate the phenomenon of persistence and the effectiveness of interventions to augment population size, we assessed genetic diversity among daces inhabiting Foskett Spring, a refuge at Dace Spring, and three nearby streams. Analysis revealed a robust effective population size (Ne) of nearly 5,000 within Foskett Spring, though Ne in the Dace Spring refuge is just 10% of that value. Heterozygosity is slightly lower than expected based on random mating at all five sites, indicating mild inbreeding, but not at a level of concern. These results confirm the genetic health of Foskett Dace. Unexpectedly, genetic differentiation reveals closer similarity between Foskett Dace and a newly discovered population from Nevadas Coleman Creek than between Foskett Dace and dace elsewhere in Oregon. Demographic modeling inferred Coleman Creek as the ancestral source of Foskett Dace just 600 years ago, much more recently than previously suspected and coincident with the arrival of large herbivores whose grazing may have maintained open water suitable for reproduction. These results solve the enigma of persistence by greatly shortening the duration over which Foskett Dace have inhabited their isolated spring.",

    "abstract": "3D (bio)printing technology has boosted the advancement of the biomedical field. However, tissue engineering is in its infancy and (bio)printing biomimetic constructions for tissue formation in vitro is still a default. As a new methodology to improve in vitro studies, we suggest the use of a cross-linkable aqueous support bath to pattern the characteristics of the scaffolds during the 3D printing process. Using fluid-phase, different molecules can be added to specific locations of the substrate promoting cell behaviour guidance and compartmentalization. Moreover, mechanical aspects can be customized by changing the type or concentration of the solution in which the (bio)printing is acquired. In this study, we first assessed different formulations of alginate/gelatin to improve cell colonization in our printings. On formulations with lower gelatin content, the U2OS cells increased 2.83 times the cell growth. In addition, the alginate-gelatin hydrogel presented a good printability in both air and fluid-phase, however the fluid-phase printings showed better printing fidelity as it diminished the collapsing and the spreading of the hydrogel strand. Next, the fluid-phase methodology was used to guide cell colonization in our printings. First, different stiffness were created by crosslinking the hydrogel with different concentrations of CaCl2 during the printing process. As a result, the U2OS cells were compartmentalized on the stiffer parts of the printings. In addition, using fluid-phase to add RGD molecules to specific parts of the hydrogel has also promoted guidance on cell growth. Finally, our results showed that by combining stiffer alginate-gelatin hydrogel with RGD increasing concentrations we can create a synergetic effect and boost cell growth by up to 3.17-fold. This work presents a new printing process for tailoring multiple parameters in hydrogel substrates by using fluid-phase to generate a more faithful replication of the in vivo environment.",

    "abstract": "Modern mass spectrometry-based metabolomics generates vast amounts of mass spectral data as part of the chemical inventory of biospecimens. Annotation of the resulting MS/MS spectra remains a challenging task that mostly relies on database interrogations, in silico prediction and interpretation of diagnostic fragmentation schemes and/or expert knowledge-based manual interpretations. A key limitation is additionally that these approaches typically leave a vast proportion of the (bio)chemical space unannotated. Here we report a deep neural network method to predict chemical structures solely from high-resolution MS/MS spectra. This novel approach initially relies on the encoding of SMILES strings from chemical structures using a continuous chemical descriptor space that had been previously implemented for molecule design. The deep neural network was trained on 83,358 natural product-derived MS/MS spectra of the GNPS library and of the NIST HRMS database with addition of the calculated neutral losses for those spectra. After this training and parameter optimization phase, the deep neural network approach was then used to predict structures from MS/MS spectra not included in the training data-set. Our current version, implemented in the Python programming language, accurately predicted 7 structures from 744 validation structures and the following 14 structures had a Tanimoto similarity score above 0.9 when compared to the true structure. It was also able to correctly identify two structures from the CASMI 2022 international contest. On average the Tanimoto similarity is of 0.40 for data of the CASMI 2022 international contest and of 0.39 for the validation data-set. Finally, our deep neural network is also able to predict the number of 60 functional groups as well as the molecular formula of chemical structures and adduct type for the analyzed MS/MS spectra. Importantly, this deep neural network approach is extremely fast, in comparison to currently available methods, making it suitable to predict on regular computers structures for all substances within large metabolomics datasets.",

    "abstract": "Glioma contains malignant cells in diverse states. Hypoxic regions are associated with a unique histology of pseudopalisading cells, while other regions appear to have limited histological organization, reflecting the diffuse nature of glioma cells. Here, we combine spatial transcriptomics with spatial proteomics and novel computational approaches to define glioma cellular states at high granularity and uncover their organization. We find three prominent modes of cellular organization. First, cells in any given state tend to be spatially clustered, such that tumors are composed of small local environments that are each typically enriched with one major cellular state. Second, specific pairs of states preferentially reside in proximity across multiple scales. Despite the unique composition of each tumor, this pairing of states remains largely consistent across tumors. Third, the pairwise interactions that we detect collectively define a global architecture composed of five layers. Hypoxia appears to drive this 5-layered organization, as it is both associated with unique states of surrounding cells and with a long-range organization that extends from the hypoxic core to the infiltrative edge of the tumor. Accordingly, tumor regions distant from any hypoxic foci and tumors that lack hypoxia such as IDH-mutant glioma are less organized. In summary, we provide a conceptual framework for the organization of gliomas at the resolution of cellular states and highlight the role of hypoxia as a long-range tissue organizer.",

    "abstract": "There is interest in the development of early-life stage (ELS) tests with fish embryo models that are high-throughput and can generate transcriptomics point of departure (tPOD) values. The objective of this study was to establish a method in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) hatchlings that could satisfy both of these interests. We based our pilot method on recent efforts by U.S. EPA researchers to establish a larval fathead minnow high throughput transcriptomics assay. Here, 1-2 day post hatch trout were assayed in 24-well plates in which they were exposed for 24 hours to 12 different concentrations of test chemicals, including a negative control (DMSO, culture water). Test concentrations were anchored with a chemicals LC50 data from the US EPA ECOTOX database and EnviroTox database, and from this, concentrations were spaced on a half-log basis that spanned 6-7 orders of magnitude. In pilot study 1 we tested 3,4-dichloroaniline, CuSO4 (0.34 mg/L), and ethinylestradiol. In pilot study 2 we tested 3,4-dichloroaniline (58.5 mg/L), CuSO4 (0.34 and 0.41 mg/L), ethinylestradiol (>10 {micro}g/L), permethrin (>10 {micro}g/L), malathion (0.61 mg/L), 6PPD quinone (5.6 {micro}g/L), acetaldehyde (41.2 mg/L), 4-fluoroaniline (242.7 mg/L), glyphosate ([~]150 mg/L), ethanol (>1 g/L), thiamethoxam (>300 mg/L), and allyl alcohol (>30 mg/L). In both pilot studies derived LC50 values are provided in parentheses. Repeated studies of CuSO4 yielded consistent LC50 values (0.34, 0.34, 0.41 mg/L). The correlation between LC50s from the current study for rainbow trout embryos versus those from the literature on adult rainbow trout for 7 chemicals was r2 = 0.91. Work is underway to optimize transcriptomics assays from these samples using EcoToxChips and UPXome, with the ultimate goal to be able to derive transcriptomics points of departure. Taken together these results provide a foundation towards establishing a novel testing platform for chemical and environmental risk assessment that is much quicker (24 hrs), ethical (non-protected life stages), resource efficient (e.g., microplate-based, small volumes of chemicals), and more informative (molecular clues into MOA) than traditional bioassay approaches.",

    "abstract": "Nucleoli are surrounded by Peri-Centromeric Heterochromatin (PCH), reflecting a close spatial association between the two largest biomolecular condensates in eukaryotic nuclei. We have investigated how this highly conserved organization is established de novo during early Drosophila development and whether these distinct condensates influence each others 3D organization. High-resolution live imaging revealed a highly dynamic process in which the PCH progressively surrounds nucleoli through a series of stage-specific intermediates. To assess interplay between the condensates, nucleolus assembly was eliminated by deleting the ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA), resulting in increased PCH compaction and subsequent reorganization to a hollow shell. In addition, in embryos lacking rDNA, some nucleolar proteins were abnormally redistributed into new bodies or  neocondensates, including enrichment in the PCH hollow core. These observations, combined with computational modeling, led to the hypothesis that nucleolar-PCH associations are mediated by a hierarchy of affinities between PCH, nucleoli, and  amphiphilic protein(s) that interact with both nucleolar and PCH components. We identified the nucleolar protein Pitchoune as a candidate for such an amphiphilic protein because it also contains a PCH-interaction motif and fills the PCH hollow core in embryos lacking rDNA. Together, these results unveil a dynamic program for establishing nucleolar-PCH associations during animal development, demonstrate that nucleoli are required for normal PCH organization, and identify Pitchoune as a likely molecular link for stabilizing PCH-nucleolar associations. Finally, we propose that disrupting affinity hierarchies could cause cellular disease phenotypes by liberating components that form  neocondensates or other abnormal structures through self-association and secondary affinities.",

    "abstract": "The outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) creates a boundary that imports most of the mitochondrial proteome while removing extraneous or damaged proteins. How the OMM senses aberrant proteins and remodels to maintain OMM integrity remains unresolved. Previously, we identified a piecemeal autophagic mechanism called the mitochondrial-derived compartment (MDC) that removes a subset of the mitochondrial proteome. Here we show that MDCs specifically sequester proteins localized only at the OMM, providing an explanation for how select mitochondrial proteins are removed by MDCs. Remarkably, selective sorting into MDCs also occurs within the OMM, as subunits of the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex are excluded from MDCs unless assembly of the TOM complex is impaired. Considering that overloading the OMM with mitochondrial membrane proteins or mistargeted tail-anchored membrane proteins induces MDCs to form and sequester these proteins, we propose that one functional role of MDCs is to create an OMM-enriched trap that segregates and sequesters excess proteins from the mitochondrial surface.\n\nSUMMARYWilson and colleagues observe that mitochondrial-derived compartments (MDCs) selectively incorporate proteins from only the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), and robustly sequester both excess and mistargeted proteins into this OMM-enriched domain, suggesting MDCs act to remove surplus hydrophobic cargo from mitochondria.",

DNA methylation variations were introduced into the parasite vector snail Biomphalaria glabrata with low genetic diversity by chemical treatment in F0 and followed over 3 generations using epigenetic recombinant inbred lines (epiRILs). We observed phenotypic variation in complex traits such as fecundity and susceptibility to infestation by Schistosoma mansoni and DNA methylation differences in F3. Both, increase and decrease of infestation success (up to 100% and down to 20% prevalence in epiRILs and from 86% to 94% in control RILs) indicated variation in complex resistance/compatibility trait. Average prevalence in control RILs was 84{+/-}5% but only 68{+/-}21 % in epiRILs. Fecundity also changed and was in average 47{+/-}7% in control RILs and 59{+/-}18% in epiRILs, being 12% higher in epiRILs. We found that the heritability h2 of the fecundity in the epiRILs was between 0.5 and 0.6 depending on the method used to estimate it. We developed a model for introducing epimutant offspring snails into resident susceptible populations. If genetic assimilation of the resistant phenotype occured in a small fraction of the introduced epimutant snails, we predict that the susceptible phenotype is replaced by the resistant phenotype after 50-70 generations.",

In the grand universe, the convex hulls formed by the universes of seven kingdoms are mutually disjoint, and the convex hulls formed by different biological groups within each kingdom are mutually disjoint. This study provides a novel geometric perspective for studying molecular biology and also offers an accurate way for large-scale sequence comparison in a real-time manner.

    "abstract": "Carboxysomes are protein microcompartments that function in the bacterial CO2 concentrating mechanism (CCM) to facilitate CO2 assimilation. To do so, carboxysomes assemble from thousands of constituent proteins into an icosahedral shell which encapsulates the enzymes rubisco and carbonic anhydrase to form structures typically >100 nm and >300 megadaltons. Although many of the protein interactions driving the assembly process have been determined, it remains unknown how size and composition are precisely controlled. Here we show that the size of -carboxysomes is controlled by the disordered scaffolding protein CsoS2. CsoS2 contains two classes of related peptide repeats which bind to the shell in a distinct fashion, and our data indicate that size is controlled by the relative number of these interactions. We propose an energetic and structural model wherein the two repeat classes bind at the junction of shell hexamers but differ in their preferences for the shell contact angles, and thus the local curvature. In total, this model suggests that a set of specific and repeated interactions between CsoS2 and shell proteins collectively achieve the large size and monodispersity of -carboxysomes.",

    "abstract": "Adaptation of avian influenza RNA polymerase (FluPol) to human cells requires mutations on the 627-NLS domains of the PB2 subunit. The E627K adaptive mutation compensates a 33-amino-acid deletion in the acidic intrinsically disordered domain of the host transcription regulator ANP32A, a deletion that restricts FluPol activity in mammalian cells. The function of ANP32A in the replication transcription complex and in particular its role in host restriction remain poorly understood. Here we characterise ternary complexes formed between ANP32A, FluPol and the viral nucleoprotein, NP, supporting the putative role of ANP32A in shuttling NP to the replicase complex. We demonstrate that while FluPol and NP can simultaneously bind distinct linear motifs on avian ANP32A, the deletion in the shorter human ANP32A blocks this mode of colocalization. NMR reveals that NP and human-adapted Pol, containing the E627K mutation, simultaneously bind the identical extended linear motif on human ANP32A, in an electrostatically driven, highly dynamic and multivalent ternary complex. This study reveals a probable molecular mechanism underlying host adaptation, whereby E627K, which enhances the basic surface of the 627 domain, is selected to confer the necessary multivalent properties to allow ANP32A to colocalize NP and FluPol in human cells.",

Among these, FZD6 is closely associated with lens development. Understanding FZD activation mechanism is key to unlock these emerging targets. Here we present the cryo-EM structures of FZD6 and FZD3 which are known to relay non-canonical Wnt-PCP (planar cell polarity) signaling pathways as well as FZD1 in their G protein-coupled (active) and G protein-free (inactive) states, respectively. Comparison of the three inactive/active pairs unveiled a shared activation framework among all ten FZDs. Mutagenesis along with imaging and functional analysis on the human lens epithelial tissues suggested potential crosstalk between G-protein binding and Wnt-PCP signaling pathways. Together, this study provides an integrated understanding of FZD structure and function, and lays the foundation for developing therapeutic modulators to activate or inhibit FZD signaling for a range of disorders including cancers and cataracts.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy is characterized by the formation of double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes. ATG2A and ATG9A play an essential role in autophagy by mediating lipid transfer and re-equilibration between membranes for autophagosome formation. Here we report the cryo-EM structures of human ATG2A-WIPI4 complex at 3.2 [A], and ATG2A-WIPI4-ATG9A complex at 7 [A] resolution. The ATG2A structure is characterized by a central hydrophobic cavity formed by a network of {beta}-strands that facilitates lipid transfer, and highly flexible N- and C-terminal domains. Molecular dynamics simulations of the ATG2A N-terminal domain revealed the mechanism of lipid-extraction from the donor membranes while the ATG2A-ATG9A complex structure provides insights into the later stages of the lipid transfer reaction. ATG9A-ATG2A structural analysis revealed a 1:1 stoichiometry, directly aligning the ATG9A lateral pore with ATG2A lipid transfer cavity, hence allowing for a direct transfer of lipids from ATG2A. The ATG9A trimer can interact with both N- and C-terminal tip of rod-shaped ATG2A. Cryo-electron tomography of ATG2A-liposome binding states shows that ATG2A tethers lipid vesicles at different orientations. In summary, this study provides a molecular basis for the growth of the phagophore membrane, and lends structural insights into spatially coupled lipid transport and re-equilibration during autophagosome formation.",

The resulting algorithm is more efficient than the state-of-the-art but with better assembly results. metaMDBG was 1.5 to 12 times faster than competing assemblers and requires between one-tenth and one-thirtieth of the memory across a range of data sets. We obtained up to twice as many high-quality circularised prokaryotic metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) on the most complex communities, and a better recovery of viruses and plasmids. metaMDBG performs particularly well for abundant organisms whilst being robust to the presence of strain diversity. The result is that for the first time it is possible to efficiently reconstruct the majority of complex communities by abundance as nearcomplete MAGs.",

Our model revealed a surprising role of codon usage in regulating translation termination, which was experimentally validated. We also identified thousands of new open reading frames in mRNAs or annotated lncRNAs, some of which were confirmed experimentally. Remarkably, the model trained with human mRNAs achieved high prediction accuracy in all eukaryotes and good prediction in polycistronic transcripts from prokaryotes or RNA viruses, suggesting a high degree of conservation in translation control.

    "abstract": "A major impediment to the actualization of the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based personalized medicine revolution is the lack of widely accepted standard operating procedures (SOPs) across different groups and institutions. The various methods employed can include choice of starting materials, reprogramming agents, and culture conditions, with each of these factors hypothesized to influence the reprogramming efficiency and transcriptional identity of iPSCs. As such, we systematically compared iPSC reprogramming procedures using cells derived from the somatic cells of three patients with 16p11.2 deletion syndrome (16p11.2del) and found remarkable similarity among the different methods. FACS analysis revealed that regardless of somatic cell type (fibroblast, lymphocyte, erythroblast), route of reprogramming factor introduction (mRNA, Sendai virus, episome), donor sex, or facility (Rutgers, NYSCF), 16p11.2del patient iPSCs were viable as high purity cultures expressing pluripotency marker proteins. This observation was supported at the transcript level by qPCR analysis, which demonstrated the ability for the iPSCs to differentiate into all three embryonic germ cell lineages after 12 days in culture as embryoid bodies. NGN2-mediated differentiation of these iPSCs produced functional neurons that formed active synaptic networks as revealed by multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings. Importantly, no group-wise comparisons among the reprogramming methods yielded consistent statistically significant differences, indicating that these procedures are equally capable of producing pluripotent stem cells that can efficiently differentiate into mature, functional neurons. This work highlights the utility of these reprogramming methods and supports the use of differentially reprogrammed iPSCs for direct comparative studies of human neurodevelopment.",

Environmental shifts are anticipated to trigger destabilizing events across the planet. In this study, we model how gradual environmental changes impact ecosystems, specifically when leading to a loss of diversity. We investigate how an ecosystem, within a serial-dilution setup, relaxes to a stable steady state. Our results reveal that as an ecosystem approaches its loss of diversity transition, its dynamics slow down. Consequently, diverse ecosystems, such as tropical rainforest soils, gradually driven past their transition point may exhibit a significant response lag. This suggests that some ecosystems may be closer to a collapse in diversity than current observations indicate. Although our model does not capture the full complexity of real-world ecosystems, it highlights critical aspects underlying the loss of biodiversity in changing environments. This has potential implications for empirical studies and when planning interventions.",

    "abstract": "Modulation of pH is crucial to maintain the chemical homeostasis of biological environments. Irregular metabolic pathways exhibited by cancer cells result in the production of acidic byproducts that are excreted and accumulated in the extracellular tumor microenvironment reducing its pH. As a consequence of the lower pH in tumors, cancer cells increase the expression of metastatic phenotypes and chemotherapeutic resistance. We present an injectable chitosan-polyethylene glycol hydrogel that can be dual-loaded with doxorubicin and sodium bicarbonate providing alkaline buffering of extracellular acidity and chemotherapeutic delivery to increase chemotherapeutic efficacy. We conducted in vitro studies of weak base chemotherapeutic and alkaline buffer release from the hydrogel. The release of doxorubicin from hydrogels increased in a low pH environment and was dependent on the encapsulated sodium bicarbonate concentration. We investigated the influence of pH on doxorubicin efficacy and viability of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. The results show a 2 to 3 fold increase in IC50 values from neutral pH to low pH, showing decreased cancer cell viability at neutral pH as compared to acidic pH. The IC50 results were shown to correlate with a decrease in intracellular uptake of doxorubicin at low pH. The proposed hydrogels were confirmed to be non-toxic to healthy MCF-10A mammary epithelial cells. Rheological studies were performed to verify that the dual loaded hydrogels were injectable. The chemotherapeutic activity of doxorubicin was evaluated in the presence of proposed pH regulating hydrogels. The findings suggest a promising non-toxic biocompatible hydrogel buffer delivery system that can achieve two simultaneous important goals of local acidosis neutralization and chemotherapeutic release.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionKDM2B encodes a JmjC domain-containing histone lysine demethylase, which functions as an oncogene in several types of tumors, including TNBC. This study was initiated to address the cancer relevance of the results of our earlier work, which had shown that overexpression of KDM2B renders mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) resistant to oxidative stress by regulating antioxidant mechanisms.\n\nMethodsWe mainly employed a multi-omics strategy consisting of RNA-Seq, quantitative TMT proteomics, Mass-spectrometry-based global metabolomics, ATAC-Seq and ChIP-seq, to explore the role of KDM2B in the resistance to oxidative stress and intermediary metabolism. These data and data from existing patient datasets were analyzed using bioinformatic tools, including exon-intron-split analysis (EISA), FLUFF and clustering analyses. The main genetic strategy we employed was gene silencing with shRNAs. ROS were measured by flow cytometry, following staining with CellROX and various metabolites were measured with biochemical assays, using commercially available kits. Gene expression was monitored with qRT-PCR and immunoblotting, as indicated.\n\nResultsThe knockdown of KDM2B in basal-like breast cancer cell lines lowers the levels of GSH and sensitizes the cells to ROS inducers, GSH targeting molecules, and DUB inhibitors. To address the mechanism of GSH regulation, we knocked down KDM2B in MDA-MB-231 cells and we examined the effects of the knockdown, using a multi-omics strategy. The results showed that KDM2B, functioning in the context of ncPRC1.1, regulates a network of epigenetic and transcription factors, which control a host of metabolic enzymes, including those involved in the SGOC, glutamate, and GSH metabolism. They also showed that KDM2B enhances the chromatin accessibility and expression of MYC and ATF4, and that it binds in concert with MYC and ATF4, the promoters of a large number of transcriptionally active genes, including many, encoding metabolic enzymes. Additionally, MYC and ATF4 binding sites were enriched in genes whose accessibility depends on KDM2B, and analysis of a cohort of TNBCs expressing high or low levels of KDM2B, but similar levels of MYC and ATF4 identified a subset of MYC targets, whose expression correlates with the expression of KDM2B. Further analyses of basal-like TNBCs in the same cohort, revealed that tumors expressing high levels of all three regulators exhibit a distinct metabolic signature that carries a poor prognosis.\n\nConclusionsThe present study links KDM2B, ATF4, and MYC in a transcriptional network that regulates the expression of multiple metabolic enzymes, including those that control the interconnected SGOC, glutamate, and GSH metabolic pathways. The co-occupancy of the promoters of many transcriptionally active genes, by all three factors, the enrichment of MYC binding sites in genes whose chromatin accessibility depends on KDM2B, and the correlation of the levels of KDM2B with the expression of a subset of MYC target genes in tumors that express similar levels of MYC, suggest that KDM2B regulates both the expression and the transcriptional activity of MYC. Importantly, the concerted expression of all three factors also defines a distinct metabolic subset of TNBCs with poor prognosis. Overall, this study identifies novel mechanisms of SGOC regulation, suggests novel KDM2B-dependent metabolic vulnerabilities in TNBC, and provides new insights into the role of KDM2B in the epigenetic regulation of transcription.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=122 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/548031v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (34K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bac894org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c6977eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@103d73corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@127b1ff_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsThe knockdown of KDM2B in basal-like breast cancer cell lines lowers the levels of GSH and sensitizes the cells to ROS inducers, GSH targeting molecules, and DUB inhibitors.\n\nKDM2B regulates intermediary metabolism by targeting the expression of a host of metabolic enzymes, including those in the SGOC, glutamate, and GSH metabolism.\n\nKDM2B enhances chromatin accessibility of MYC and ATF4 and promotes their expression.\n\nMYC and ATF4 binding sites are enriched in the promoters of genes whose accessibility depends on KDM2B.\n\nKDM2B functioning in the context of ncPRC1.1, binds the promoters of transcriptionally active genes, including those encoding KDM2B-regulated metabolic enzymes, in concert with MYC and ATF4.\n\nBasal-like TNBCs expressing high levels of all three regulators, exhibit a distinct metabolic signature that is associated with poor prognosis.",

Differently, in ZEB1 competent AML, IL-17 sustains the development of a pro-invasive and self-maintaining loop inducing MMPs and SOCS2. In humans, AML patients show, in situ on bone marrow biopsies, a direct correlation between ZEB1 and Th17 and, in gene expression profile when divided according to the median value of ZEB1 expression, a different overall survival and relapse along with the expression of MMPs, SOCS2 and Th17 cells enrichment.

    "abstract": "Gene regulation in eukaryotes relies on many mechanisms for optimal expression, including both protein transcription factors and DNA regulatory elements. CRISPR-based screens of both protein coding genes and non-coding regions have allowed identification of these transcriptional networks in human cells. Double-stranded DNA viruses also invoke human-like regulation to control transcription of viral genes that are required at different stages of the viral lifecycle. Here, we applied CRISPR-based tools to dissect regulation of a viral gene at high resolution in the oncogenic human herpesvirus Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), whose compact, densely encoded genome provides unique challenges and opportunities for studying transcriptional networks. Through a combination of CRISPR-interference (CRISPRi) and Cas9 nuclease screening, we mapped a novel regulatory network comprised of coding and noncoding elements that influence expression of the essential KSHV protein ORF68 at early and late stages of the viral lifecycle. ORF68 encodes an essential protein involved in packaging the replicated viral DNA into nascent capsids. Although ORF68 expression initiates early in the viral lifecycle, we found that it is primarily required at later times. This work demonstrates the ability to exhaustively identify features controlling a given locus, essentially capturing a complete viral regulatory circuit that functions within the human nucleus to control transcription.",

    "abstract": "All photosynthetic bacteria and some chemoautotrophic bacteria fix CO2 into sugars in specialized proteinaceous compartments called carboxysomes. Carboxysomes enclose the enzymes Rubisco and carbonic anhydrase inside a layer of shell proteins to increase the CO2 concentration for efficient carbon fixation by Rubisco. In the -carboxysome lineage, a disordered and highly repetitive protein named CsoS2 is essential for carboxysome formation and function. Without it, the bacteria are unable to fix enough carbon to grow in air. How a protein lacking structure serves as the architectural scaffold for such a vital cellular compartment remains unknown. In this study, we identify key residues in CsoS2 that are necessary for building functional -carboxysomes in vivo. These highly conserved and repetitive residues, VTG and Y, contribute to the interaction between CsoS2 and shell proteins. We also demonstrate in vitro reconstitution of the -carboxysome into spherical condensates with CsoS2, Rubisco, and shell proteins, and show the utility of reconstitution as a biochemical tool to study carboxysome biogenesis. The precise self-assembly of thousands of proteins is crucial for carboxysome formation, and understanding this process could enable their use in alternative biological hosts or industrial processes as effective tools to fix carbon.",

    "abstract": "Degeneration of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra and their striatal axon terminals causes cardinal motor symptoms of Parkinsons disease (PD). In idiopathic cases, high levels of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations associated with mitochondrial dysfunction are a central feature of these vulnerable neurons. Here we present a mouse model expressing the K320E-variant of the mitochondrial helicase Twinkle in dopamine neurons, leading to accelerated mtDNA ageing. K320E-TwinkleDaN mice showed normal motor function at 20 months of age, although already [~]70% of nigral dopamine neurons had perished. The remaining neuron population still preserved [~]75% of axon terminals in the dorsal striatum, which enabled normal dopamine release. Transcriptome analysis and viral tracing confirmed compensatory axonal sprouting of surviving nigral dopamine neurons. We conclude that a small population of substantia nigra neurons can adapt to mtDNA mutations and maintain motor control in mice, holding chances for new treatment strategies in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a complex cardiovascular pathology, culminating in aortic stenosis, heart failure and premature mortality, with no comprehensive treatment strategy, except valve replacement. While T cells have been identified within the valve, their contribution to pathogenesis remains unclear. To elucidate the heterogenous phenotype of the immune populations present within patients with CAVD, deep phenotypic screens of paired valve and peripheral blood cells were conducted via flow cytometry (n=20) and immunohistochemistry (n=10). Following identification of a significant population of memory T cells; specifically, CD8+ T cells within the valve, single cell RNA sequencing and paired single T cell receptor sequencing was conducted on a further 4 patients on CD45+ CD3+, CD4+ or CD8+ T cells. Through unsupervised clustering, 7 T cell populations were identified within the blood and 10 identified within the valve. Tissue resident memory (TRM) T cells were detected for the first time within the valve, exhibiting a highly cytotoxic, activated, and terminally differentiated phenotype. This pan-pro-inflammatory signal was differentially identified in T cells originating from the valve, and not observed in the blood, indicative of an adaptive, local not-systemic inflammatory signature in CAVD patients. T cell receptor analysis identified hyperexpanded clones within the CD8+ T cell central memory (TCM) population, with TRM cells comprising the majority of large and medium clonal expansion within the entire T cell population. Clonal interaction network analysis demonstrated the greatest proportion of clones originating from CD8+ T cell effector memory (TEM) and CD4+ naive / TCM populations and ending in the CD8+ TRM and CD8+ TCM clusters, suggesting a clonal expansion and predicted trajectory of T cells towards a tissue resident, cytotoxic environment within the valve. CDR3 epitope predictive analysis identified 7 potential epitope targets, of which GALNT4 and CR1L have previously been implicated in a cardiovascular context as mediators of inflammation. Taken together, the data identified T cell sub-populations within the context of CAVD and further predicted possible epitopes responsible for the clonal expansion of the valvular T cells, which may be important for propagating inflammation in CAVD.",

    "abstract": "AimUnderstanding the spatial structuring of ecological communities requires us to consider the interplay between evolutionary history and environmental factors. In this study, we investigated the influence of Canidae phylogenetic structure on the distribution and trait patterns of lineages across the planet.\n\nLocationAmericas, Africa, Eurasia.\n\nTime period12 million years ago - present.\n\nMajor taxa studiedCanidae.\n\nMethodsUsing distribution data and phylogenetic information for 37 Canidae species, we employed phylogenetic fuzzy-weighting to compare assemblages based on their phylogenetic similarity.\n\nResultsOur results revealed distinct global patterns of body size, body mass, range size, habitat type, and evolutionary distinctiveness among lineages. We also identified the shared contributions of phylogenetic structure and temperature to trait variation using variance partitioning analysis. The PCPS axes highlighted the influence of phylogenetic relationships on Canidae assemblages, particularly in South America.\n\nMain conclusionsNotably, the study challenges the applicability of Bergmanns and Rapoports rules in explaining canids sizes and range sizes geographic variation across continents, emphasizing the importance of phylogenetic information. The unique diversification history of Canidae in South America and Africa and their diverse environmental conditions likely contribute to the observed trait patterns that make both continents so distinguished when compared to N. America and Eurasia. Our findings underscore the need to incorporate phylogenetic information in models assessing trait variation across geographic scales for unbiased estimations.",

    "abstract": "U6 and 7SK snRNAs process a 5 cap, believed to be essential for their stability and maintained by mammalian MePCE or Drosophila Bin3 enzymes. Although loss of either protein results in 7SK instability, loss of neither is associated with U6 reduction. Their yeast homolog is also not required for U6 stability, casting further doubts on the function of capping U6. Here we show that the Drosophila Amus protein, homologous to both Bin3 and MePCE, is essential for U6 but not 7SK stability. A full function of Amus is required for Drosophila development, and that rests primarily on Amuss methylase activity. Remarkably, the loss of U6 is rescued by the expression of an Amus-MePCE hybrid protein harboring the methyltransferase domain from MePCE, highlighting the conserved function of the two proteins as the U6 capping enzyme. Our new investigations in human cells establish a dependence of both U6 and 7SK stability on MePCE, resolving a long-standing uncertainty. While uncovering an interesting division of labor of Bin3/MePCE/Amus proteins, we discovered a \"Bin3-Box\" domain present only in enzymes associated with 7SK regulation. Targeted mutagenesis in Drosophila confirmed its importance for Bin3 function, revealing a possible conserved element in 7SK but not U6 biology.",
