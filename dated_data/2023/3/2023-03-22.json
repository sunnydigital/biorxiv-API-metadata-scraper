    "abstract": "Despite widespread immunization with Bacille-Calmette-Guerin (BCG), the only currently licensed tuberculosis (TB) vaccine, TB remains a leading cause of mortality globally. There are many TB vaccine candidates in the developmental pipeline, but the lack of a robust animal model to assess vaccine efficacy has hindered our ability to prioritize candidates for human clinical trials. Here we use a murine ultra-low dose (ULD) Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) challenge model to assess protection conferred by BCG vaccination. We show that BCG confers a reduction in lung bacterial burdens that is more durable than that observed after conventional dose challenge, curbs Mtb dissemination to the contralateral lung, and, in a small percentage of mice, prevents detectable infection. These findings are consistent with the ability of human BCG vaccination to mediate protection, particularly against disseminated disease, in specific human populations and clinical settings. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the ultra-low dose Mtb infection model can measure distinct parameters of immune protection that cannot be assessed in conventional dose murine infection models and could provide an improved platform for TB vaccine testing.",

    "abstract": "Cryptosporidium hominis and Cryptosporidium parvum are responsible for more than 90% of the global cryptosporidiosis. Species identification is done by amplification of small subunit ribosomal ribonucleic acid (SSU rRNA) gene, followed by sequencing. We have developed a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) assay which detect Cryptosporidium spp. and differentiates C. hominis and C. parvum from stool samples without the need of post amplification sequencing. Nine new set of primers for mPCR assay were designed and the mPCR assay was standardized with known positive Cryptosporidium DNA template. Best result with three sets of primers that amplifies 436 bp for all Cryptosporidium spp., 577 bp for C. hominis and 287 bp for C. parvum. In addition, thirty-five positive and thirty-five negative Cryptosporidium stool samples identified by the gold standard nested 18S rRNA PCR-sequencing assay were tested by mPCR. The sensitivity of the mPCR are 100%, 92.9%, and 87.5% for Cryptosporidium spp., C. hominis, and C. parvum respectively while specificity is 100% for all the three primers. No cross-reactivity was observed by the new mPCR assay when tested with five known DNA sample of Cystoisospora belli and two known DNA sample of Cyclospora cayetanensis, available in our laboratory from the clinical stool samples. A single species-specific mPCR product of C. hominis and C. parvum were sequenced and deposited in GenBank database with the accession no MT862538 and MT875168 respectively. The mPCR assay is developed which differentiates C. hominis, and C. parvum in a single test run of amplification and without the need for RFLP or sequencing. Although it less sensitive than 18S rRNA PCR-sequencing assay, but 100% specific, rapid, cost-effective and suitable for making diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis especially in developing countries.\n\nHighlightsO_LINovel mPCR assay can detect all Cryptosporidium species\nC_LIO_LIThe sensitivity of the mPCR were 100%, 92.9%, and 87.5% for the primers designed to detect Cryptosporidium genus, C. hominis and C. parvum species respectively.\nC_LIO_LINo cross reactivity detected with newly developed mPCR assuring 100% specificity.\nC_LIO_LIThe developed mPCR assay is a robust, specific, reproducible, rapid and cost-effective molecular assay for the diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis.\nC_LIO_LIAssay is useful in molecular diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis, especially in developing countries.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Transfer of ADP-ribose (ADPr) from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to target proteins is mediated by a class of human poly-ADP-ribose polymerases, PARPs, and removal of ADPr is catalyzed by a family of glycohydrolases. Although thousands of potential ADPr modification sites have been identified using high-throughput mass-spectrometry, relatively little is known about sequence specificity encoded near the modification site. Herein, we present a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) method that facilitates the discovery and validation of ADPr site motifs. We identify a minimal 5-mer peptide sequence that is sufficient to drive PARP14 specific activity while highlighting the importance of the adjacent residues in PARP14 targeting. We measure the stability of the resultant ester bond and show that non-enzymatic removal is sequence independent and occurs within hours. Finally, we use the ADPr--peptide to highlight differential activities within the glycohydrolase family and their sequence specificities. Our results highlight: 1) the utility of MALDI-TOF in motif discovery and 2) the importance of peptide sequence in governing ADPr transfer and removal.",
