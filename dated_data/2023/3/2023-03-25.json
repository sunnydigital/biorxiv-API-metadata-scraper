    "abstract": "Integrin mechanosensing plays an instrumental role in cell behavior, phenotype, and fate by transmitting mechanical signals that trigger downstream molecular and cellular changes. For instance, force transfer along key amino acid residues can mediate cell adhesion. Disrupting key binding sites within 5{beta}1 integrins binding partner, fibronectin (FN) diminishes adhesive strength. While past studies have shown the importance of these residues in cell adhesion, the relationship between the dynamics of these residues and how integrin distributes force across the cell surface remains less explored. Here, we present a multiscale mechanical model to investigate the mechanical coupling between integrin nanoscale dynamics and whole-cell adhesion mechanics. Our framework leverages molecular dynamics simulations to investigate residues within 5{beta}1-FN during stretching and the finite element method to visualize the whole-cell adhesion mechanics. The forces per integrin across the cell surface of the whole-cell model were consistent with past atomic force microscopy and Forster resonance energy transfer measurements from literature. The molecular dynamics simulations also confirmed past studies that implicate two key sites within FN that maintain cell adhesion: the synergy site and RGD motif. Our study contributed to our understanding of molecular mechanisms by which these sites collaborate to mediate whole-cell integrin adhesion dynamics. Specifically, we showed how FN unfolding, residue binding/unbinding, and molecular structure contribute to 5{beta}1-FNs nonlinear force-extension behavior during stretching. Our computational framework could be used to explain how the dynamics of key residues influence cell differentiation or how uniquely designed protein structures could dynamically limit the spread of metastatic cells.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveA low incidence and mortality rate of cancer has been observed in high-altitude regions, suggesting a potential positive effect of low press and hypoxia (LPH) environment on cancer. Based on this finding, our study aimed to construct a pan-cancer prognosis risk model using a series of ADME genes intervened by low oxygen, to explore the impact of LPH environment on the overall survival (OS) of various kinds of cancers, and to provide new ideas and approaches for cancer prevention and treatment.\n\nDatasets and MeasuresThe study used multiple sources of data to construct the pan-cancer prognosis risk model, including gene expression and survival data of 8,628 samples from the cancer genome atlas, and three gene expression omnibus databases were employed to validate the prediction efficiency of the prognostic model. The AltitudeOmics dataset was specifically used to validate the significant changes in model gene expression in LPH. To further identify the biomarkers and refine the model, various analytical approaches were employed such as single-gene prognostic analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis, and stepwise cox regression. And LINCS L1000, AutoDockTools, and STITCH were utilized to explore effective interacting drugs for model genes.\n\nMain Outcomes and ConclusionsThe study identified eight ADME genes with significant changes in the LPH environment to describe the prognostic features of pan-cancer. Lower risk scores calculated by the model were associated with better prognosis in 25 types of tumors, with a p-value of less than 0.05. The LPH environment was found to reduce the overall expression value of model genes, which could decrease the death risk of tumor prognosis. Additionally, it is found that the low-risk group had a higher degree of T cell infiltration based on immune infiltration analysis. Finally, drug exploration led to the identification of three potential model-regulating drugs. Overall, the study provided a new approach to construct a pan-cancer survival prognosis model based on ADME genes from the perspective of LPH and offered new ideas for future tumor prognosis research.",

    "abstract": "Cells rapidly respond to replication stress actively slowing fork progression and inducing fork reversal. How replication fork plasticity is achieved in the context of nuclear organization is currently unknown. Using nuclear actin probes in living and fixed cells, we visualized nuclear actin filaments in unperturbed S phase, rapidly extending in number and thickness upon genotoxic treatments, and taking frequent contact with replication factories. Chemically or genetically impairing nuclear actin polymerization shortly before these treatments prevents active fork slowing and abolishes fork reversal. Defective fork plasticity is linked to reduced recruitment of RAD51 and SMARCAL1 to nascent DNA. Conversely, PRIMPOL gains access to replicating chromatin, promoting unrestrained and discontinuous DNA synthesis, which is associated with increased chromosomal instability and decreased cellular resistance to replication stress. Hence, nuclear F-actin orchestrates replication fork plasticity and is a key molecular determinant in the rapid cellular response to genotoxic treatments.",

    "abstract": "We previously identified VRK3 as a specific vulnerability in DMG-H3K27M cells in a synthetic lethality screen targeting the whole kinome. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the mechanisms by which VRK3 depletion impact DMG-K27M cell fitness. Gene expression studies after VRK3 knockdown emphasized the inhibition of genes involved in G1/S transition of the cell cycle resulting in growth arrest in G1. Additionally, a massive modulation of genes involved in chromosome segregation was observed, concomitantly with a reduction in the level of phosphorylation of serine 10 and serine 28 of histone H3 supporting the regulation of chromatin condensation during cell division. This last effect could be partly due to a concomitant decrease of the chromatin kinase VRK1 in DMG following VRK3 knock-down. Furthermore, a metabolic switch specific to VRK3 function was observed towards increased oxidative phosphorylation without change in mitochondria content, that we hypothesized would represent a cell rescue mechanism. This study further explored the vulnerability of DMG-H3K27M cells to VRK3 depletion suggesting potential therapeutic combinations, e.g. with the mitochondrial ClpP protease activator ONC201.",

    "abstract": "Most cancers reactivate telomerase to maintain telomere length to acquire immortality. The importance of this process is well illustrated by the fact that telomerase promoter mutations are found at a high frequency in many cancer types, including melanoma. However, it is unclear when and if telomerase is strictly required during tumorigenesis. Here, we show that melanoma can occur in the absence of telomerase but is required to sustain later growth and to avoid tumor regression. We combined telomerase mutant zebrafish (tert-/-) with two established melanoma models and found equal melanoma incidence and invasiveness as tumors became visible. Later, however, while tert+/+ fish develop increasing larger tumors, tert-/- tumors stagnate growth and regress. tert-/- tumors showed lower cell proliferation, higher apoptosis and melanocyte differentiation. We also detected an immune response directed at tert-/- tumors. tert-/- tumors exhibited increased immune cell infiltrates and resume growth when transplanted into immunocompromised hosts. We propose that telomerase is required for melanoma in zebrafish, albeit at later stages of progression, to sustain growth while avoiding immune rejection and regression. Thus, absence of telomerase restricts melanoma through tumor-autonomous mechanisms (cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and melanocyte differentiation) and a non-tumor-autonomous mechanisms (immune rejection).",

    "abstract": "ScopeEpidemiological and experimental evidence reported that processed meat consumption is associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. Several studies suggest the involvement of nitrite or nitrate additives via N-nitroso-compound formation (NOCs).\n\nMethods and resultsCompared to the reference level (120 mg/kg of ham), the effects of sodium nitrite reduction (90 mg/kg of ham), removal and replacement were analysed on ham characteristics and in a CRC rat model. Sodium nitrite removal and reduction induced a similar decrease in CRC preneoplastic lesions, but only reduction led to (i) an inhibitory effect on Listeria monocytogenes growth comparable to that obtained using the reference nitrite level of 120 mg/kg and (ii) an effective control of lipid peroxidation. Among the three alternatives tested, none led to a significant gain when compared to the 120 mg/kg ham reference level: vegetable stock, due to nitrate presence, was very similar to this reference nitrite level, yeast extract induced a strong luminal peroxidation and no decrease in preneoplastic lesions despite the absence of NOCs, and polyphenol rich extract induced the clearest downward trend on preneoplastic lesions but the concomitant presence of nitrosyl iron in feces. Except vegetable stock, other alternatives were less efficient than sodium nitrite ([&ge;] 90 mg/kg) in reducing L. monocytogenes growth.\n\nConclusionNitrite reduction (90mg/kg) effectively reduced CRC risk through limiting NOC formation and lipid peroxidation, while mitigating L. monocytogenes risks from cooked hams. Going further in reduction should be possible if accompanied by antioxidants to limit lipid peroxidation and appropriate use-by dates.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the role of the spleen and splenic macrophages in the development of high-altitude polycythemia (HAPC), a condition characterized by an imbalance between erythropoiesis and eryptosis imbalance, typically observed in high-altitude (HA) environments. We employed a mouse model subjected to hypobaric hypoxia (HH) to simulate the conditions of a 6000 m HA exposure. For in vitro examination, primary splenic macrophages were treated with 1% hypoxia. Our findings revealed that the HH treatment enhanced erythropoiesis, resulting in erythrocytosis, with marked splenic contraction evident, later progressing to splenomegaly over a 14-day period. HH exposure also impaired the ability of the spleen to process red blood cells (RBCs), predominantly due to a decrease in splenic macrophages within the red pulp. Furthermore, the application of HH treatment over 7 and 14-day intervals resulted in increased iron mobilization and onset of ferroptosis within the spleen, as corroborated by the expression of iron metabolism-related and ferroptosis-related proteins. The expression levels of these proteins mirrored gene expression levels in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Subsequent single-cell sequencing of the spleen demonstrated a substantial decrease in macrophages 7 days post-HH exposure. In vitro investigations confirmed the decline in primary splenic macrophages and induction of ferroptosis following hypoxic treatment, which were reversed by pre-treatment with the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1. In summary, the data suggested that HH exposure instigates splenic ferroptosis, predominantly in the red pulp, thereby hampering the RBCs clearance in the spleen. This leads to increased 46 RBCs retention within the spleen, triggering splenomegaly, which may potentially foster continuous RBCs production and accelerate HAPC progression. The major conclusion from this study elucidates the critical role of spleen and splenic macrophages in the pathogenesis of HAPC.",

    "abstract": "Heavy metal like lead and chromium present in environment in large quantities cause a severe environmental concern. Significant risks to the environment and agriculture are posed by heavy metal contamination of the air, water, and soil as a result of increased urbanisation and industrialization. Heavy metal pollution in soils can harm nearby ecosystems, groundwater, agricultural productivity, and human health because of its persistence and high toxicity. Heavy metals are accumulated in the tissues of plants growing in metal-contaminated soil, which can have a negative impact on the morphology of the plant. The present study was carried out to determine the effect of different concentrations (50ml, 100ml, 150ml and 200ml) of chromium and lead on morphological attributes of three varieties (JS:335, JS:80-21, JS:75-46) of soybean(Glycine max). The result of the present study showed that the exposure of Glycine max to Pb and Cr resulted in a decrease in total length, number of nodes and number of leaves of a plant. The shape of leaves in case of treated plants was also changed from ovoid to heart and oval shapes, at higher concentration of heavy metals.

In Arabidopsis accession Bur-0, abnormally expanded TTC repeat in intron-3 of the ISOPROPYLMALATE ISOMERASE LARGE SUBUNIT1 (IIL1) gene causes growth defects called the irregularly impaired leaves (iil) phenotype, triggered by DNA methylation-mediated IIL1 gene silencing at elevated temperature. However, little is known about how the reduced expression of IIL1 causes the iil phenotype. We demonstrated that the iil phenotype was resulted from the relative increase of intron-3-retained IIL1 transcripts through the experiments where the iil phenotype was reproduced by introducing the IIL1 gene harboring 100 copies of TTC repeat into Col-0. The iil phenotype appeared when the total amount of the IIL1 transcripts was decreased by co-suppression and the percentage of intron-3-retained IIL1 transcripts was increased. The IIL1 gene encodes an isopropylmalate isomerase large subunit, forming heterodimers with small subunits (AtLeuD1, AtLeuD2, or AtLeuD3). In the myb28 myb29 mutant lacking AtLeuD1 and AtLeuD2, the iil phenotype was almost completely suppressed regardless of higher percentage of intron-3-retained IIL1 transcripts. The results indicated that the iil phenotype was associated with interaction with AtLeuDs, suggesting that intronic TNR-containing transcripts were translated into abnormal proteins and perturbed the metabolic pathway supporting the leaf development.",

Moreover, we demonstrated that individual clones have distinct and differing fates, including growth, survival, or death, when subjected to a second treatment or when the first treatment is continued.

    "abstract": "Bacterial chromosomes are dynamically and spatially organised within cells. In slow-growing Escherichia coli, the chromosomal terminus is initially located at the new pole and must therefore migrate to midcell during replication to reproduce the same pattern in the daughter cells. Here, we use high-throughput time-lapse microscopy to quantify this transition, its timing and its relationship to chromosome segregation. We find that terminus centralisation is a rapid discrete event that occurs ~25 min after initial separation of duplicated origins and ~50 min before the onset of bulk nucleoid segregation but with substantial variation between cells. Despite this variation, its movement is tightly coincident with the completion of origin segregation, even in the absence of its linkage to the divisome, suggesting a coupling between these two events. Indeed, we find that terminus centralisation does not occur if origin segregation away from mid-cell is disrupted, which results in daughter cells having an inverted chromosome organisation. Overall, our study quantifies the choreography of origin-terminus positioning and identifies an unexplored connection between these loci, furthering our understanding of chromosome segregation in this bacterium.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial DNA damage response is a critical, coordinated response to endogenous and exogenous sources of DNA damage. Response dynamics are dependent on coordinated synthesis and loss of relevant proteins. While much is known about its global transcriptional control, changes in protein abundance that occur upon DNA damage are less well characterized at the system level. Here, we perform a proteome-wide survey of the DNA damage response in Caulobacter crescentus. We find that while most protein abundance changes upon DNA damage are readily explained by changes in transcription, there are exceptions. The survey also allowed us to identify the novel DNA damage response factor, YaaA, which has been overlooked by previously published, transcription- focused studies.\n\nA similar survey in a {Delta}lon strain was performed to explore lons role in DNA damage survival. The {Delta}lon strain had a smaller dynamic range of protein abundance changes in general upon DNA damage compared to the wild type strain. This system-wide change to the dynamics of the response may explain this strains sensitivity to DNA damage. Our proteome survey of the DNA damage response provides additional insight into the complex regulation of stress response and nominates a novel response factor that was overlooked in prior studies.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe DNA damage response helps bacteria to react to and potentially survive DNA damage. The mutagenesis induced during this stress response contributes to the development of antibiotic resistance. Understanding how bacteria coordinate their response to DNA damage could help us to combat this growing threat to human health. While the transcriptional regulation of the bacterial DNA damage response has been characterized, this study is the first to our knowledge to assess the proteomic response to DNA damage in Caulobacter.",

    "abstract": "The Resistance-Nodulation-Division (RND) efflux pump superfamily is pervasive among Gram-negative pathogens and contributes extensively to clinical antibiotic resistance. The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa contains 12 RND-type efflux systems, with four contributing to resistance including MexXY-OprM which is uniquely able to export aminoglycosides. At the site of initial substrate recognition, small molecule probes of the inner membrane transporter (e.g., MexY) have potential as important functional tools to understand substrate selectivity and a foundation for developing adjuvant efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs). Here, we optimized the scaffold of berberine, a known but weak MexY EPI, using an in-silico high-throughput screen to identify di-berberine conjugates with enhanced synergistic action with aminoglycosides. Further, docking and molecular dynamics simulations of di-berberine conjugates reveal unique contact residues and thus sensitivities of MexY from distinct P. aeruginosa strains. This work thereby reveals di-berberine conjugates to be useful probes of MexY transporter function and potential leads for EPI development.",

    "abstract": "Research on the ultrastructural development of the kidney is limited, and research on rodent kidneys prevails. Yet, large differences between rodent and human nephrogenesis exist and therefore translation between species is not desirable. At the same time, there is an increasing demand for human research, in addition to assessing the potential of novel therapies such as renal organoids. We therefore generated an interactive atlas of large transmission electron microscopy tile scans of first trimester human kidneys, specifically Carnegie stage 20 until post-conceptional week 12. Analysis identified key ultrastructural features of proximal and distal progenitor cells such as cell shape, microvilli and luminal budding in the renal vesicle. Regarding glomerular development, we identified a new W-shaped body stage and three distinct sub-stages of the well-known capillary loop stage. Chromatin organization, nuclear shape and location were used to describe tubule cell identity and maturity, indicating a specific order of tubular maturation. The greatest congruence with adult tissue was seen in proximal tubules and the least in distal tubules. Finally, cytoplasmic glycogen depositions in collecting duct cells, which are absent in adult tissue, were found to be an early feature distinguishing distal tubules from collecting ducts as well as differentiating cortical from medullary collecting ducts. The findings of this research provide new fundamental insights for researchers who aim to understand and recreate kidney development.",

    "abstract": "Tropical tree reproductive phenology is sensitive to changing climate, but inter-individual and interannual variability at the regional scale is poorly understood. While large-scale and long-term datasets of environmental variables are available, reproductive phenology needs to be measured in-site, limiting the spatiotemporal scales of the data. We leveraged a unique dataset assembled by SeasonWatch, a citizen-science phenology monitoring programme in India to assess the environmental correlates of fruiting and flowering in three ubiquitous and economically important tree species - jackfruit, mango and tamarind - in the south-western Indian state of Kerala. Using 165006 observations spread over 19596 individual trees and over 9 years, and temperature and rainfall predictors for the fortnight preceding each observation, accessed using the ERA5-LAND dataset, we modelled the environmental correlates of reproductive phenophases - flower and fruit occurrence - in these species using two statistical approaches - machine learning and generalised linear mixed models. In these complementary approaches, we used a leave-one-year-out approach to cross-validate the model against observations. Models of phenophase presence for all species had higher predictive power than models of phenophase intensity. We found strong influences of multiple temperature and rainfall variables on phenophase presence - soil moisture and maximum temperature had high importance values under machine learning models while the number of consecutive dry days also had high effect sizes in the generalised linear mixed models. The effect of time-varying environmental factors like total precipitation and consecutive dry days were also modified by the static predictors like elevation, aspect, and urbanisation. Taken together, our results show the pervasive influence of climate on tropical tree reproductive phenology and extent of variability among years and individuals. We also demonstrate the potential and limitations of citizen-science observations in making and testing predictions at scale for predictive climate science in tropical landscapes.",

    "abstract": "A great many plants and animals have evolved separate sexes from hermaphroditism. In species with separate sexes, the development of an individual as male or female is often controlled by a diallelic sex-determining locus (XY and ZW systems). Transitions from hermaphroditism to separate sexes must therefore have often entailed the emergence of such a locus. However, the evolutionary mechanisms governing the emergence of XY and ZW systems in ancestral hermaphroditic populations, and in particular the mechanisms leading some species to acquire an XY rather than a ZW system, remain elusive. Here, we model the co-evolution of resource allocation to male and female functions (sex allocation) with the genetic architecture of sex determination, and show that gradual evolution readily leads to the emergence of XY and ZW systems. Our model also reveals a strong influence of the shape of the relationship between resource allocation and fecundity in each sex (male and female gain curves) on whether an XY or a ZW system evolves. This is because gain curves indicate the intensity of competition for reproduction through each sex, which in turn affects selection on the genetic architecture of sex allocation. Taken together, our results advance the understanding of sexual systems by uncovering a hitherto unappreciated link between the ecology and economics of sex allocation and the genetic basis of sex determination.",

    "abstract": "The Australian lungfish is a primitive and endangered representative of the subclass Dipnoi. The distribution of this species is limited to south-east Queensland, with some populations considered endemic and others possibly descending from translocations in the late nineteenth century shortly after European discovery. Attempts to resolve the historical distribution for this species have met with conflicting results based on descriptive genetic studies. Understanding if all populations are endemic or some are the result of, or influenced by, translocation events, has implications for conservation management. In this work, we analysed the genetic variation at three types of markers (mtDNA genomes, 11 STRs, and 5,196 nuclear SNPs) using the Approximate Bayesian Computation algorithm to compare several demographic models. We postulated different contributions of Mary River and Burnett River gene pools into the Brisbane River and North Pine River populations, related to documented translocation events. We ran the analysis for each marker separately, and we also estimated the posterior probabilities of the models combining the markers. Nuclear SNPs have the highest power to correctly identify the true model amongst the simulated datasets (where the model was known), but different markers typically provided similar answers. The most supported demographic model able to explain the real dataset implies that an endemic gene pool is present in the Brisbane and North Pine Rivers where past translocations are documented. These results will inform ongoing conservation efforts for this endangered and iconic species and warrant careful consideration of future genetic management of the Australian lungfish populations.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel framework BEATRICE to identify putative causal variants from GWAS summary statistics (https://github.com/sayangsep/Beatrice-Finemapping). Identifying causal variants is challenging due to their sparsity and to highly correlated variants in the nearby regions. To account for these challenges, our approach relies on a hierarchical Bayesian model that imposes a binary concrete prior on the set of causal variants. We derive a variational algorithm for this fine-mapping problem by minimizing the KL divergence between an approximate density and the posterior probability distribution of the causal configurations. Correspondingly, we use a deep neural network as an inference machine to estimate the parameters of our proposal distribution. Our stochastic optimization procedure allows us to simultaneously sample from the space of causal configurations. We use these samples to compute the posterior inclusion probabilities and determine credible sets for each causal variant. We conduct a detailed simulation study to quantify the performance of our framework across different numbers of causal variants and different noise paradigms, as defined by the relative genetic contributions of causal and non-causal variants. Using this simulated data, we perform a comparative analysis against two state-of-the-art baseline methods for fine-mapping. We demonstrate that BEATRICE achieves uniformly better coverage with comparable power and set sizes, and that the performance gain increases with the number of causal variants. Thus, BEATRICE is a valuable tool to identify causal variants from eQTL and GWAS summary statistics across complex diseases and traits.\n\nAuthor summaryFine-mapping provides a way to uncover genetic variants that causally affect some trait of interest. However, correct identification of the causal variants is challenging due to the correlation structure shared across variants. While current fine-mapping approaches take into account this correlation structure, they are often computationally intensive to run and cannot handle spurious effects from non-causal variants. In this paper, we introduce BEATRICE, a novel framework for Bayesian fine-mapping from summary data. Our strategy is to impose a binary concrete prior over the causal configurations that can handle non-zero spurious effects and to infer the posterior probabilities of the causal variant locations using deep variational inference. In a simulation study, we demonstrate that BEATRICE achieves comparable or better performance to the current fine-mapping methods across increasing numbers of causal variants and increasing noise, as determined by the polygenecity of the trait.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasound (US) muscle image series can be used for peripheral human-machine interfacing based on global features, or even on the decomposition of US images into the contributions of individual motor units (MUs). With respect to state-of-the-art surface electromyography (sEMG), US provides higher spatial resolution and deeper penetration depth. However, the accuracy of current methods for direct US decomposition, even at low forces, is relatively poor. These methods are based on linear mathematical models of the contributions of MUs to US images. Here, we test the hypothesis of linearity by comparing the average velocity twitch profiles of MUs when varying the number of other concomitantly active units. We observe that the velocity twitch profile has a decreasing peak-to-peak amplitude when tracking the same target motor unit at progressively increasing contraction force levels, thus with an increasing number of concomitantly active units. This observation indicates non-linear factors in the generation model. Furthermore, we directly studied the impact of one MU on a neighboring MU, finding that the effect of one source on the other is not symmetrical and may be related to unit size. We conclude that a linear approximation is limiting the decomposition methods to decompose full velocity twitch trains from velocity images, highlighting the need for more advanced models and methods for US decomposition than those currently employed.",

The amount of publicly available single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data is already surpassing 50M records for human with each record measuring 20,000 genes. This highlights the need for unsupervised representation learning to fully ingest these data, yet classical transformer architectures are prohibitive to train on such data in terms of both computation and memory. To address this challenge, we propose a novel asymmetric encoder-decoder transformer for scRNA-seq data, called xTrimoGene, which leverages the sparse characteristic of the data to scale up the pre-training. This scalable design of xTrimoGene reduces FLOPs by one to two orders of magnitude compared to classical transformers while maintaining high accuracy, enabling us to train the largest transformer models over the largest scRNA-seq dataset today. Our experiments also show that the performance of xTrimoGene improves as we increase the model sizes, and it also leads to SOTA performance over various downstream tasks, such as cell classification, perturb-seq effect prediction, and drug combination prediction.",

    "abstract": "Single-molecule FRET (smFRET) is widely used to investigate dynamic (bio) molecular interactions taking place over distances of up to 10 nm. With the advent of recent super-resolution methods such as MINFLUX, MINSTED or RASTMIN, the spatiotemporal resolution of these techniques advanced towards the smFRET regime. While these methods do not suffer from the spatial restriction of FRET, they only visualize one emitter at a time, thus rendering fast dynamics of interactions out of reach. Here, we describe two approaches to overcome this limitation in pMINFLUX using its intrinsic fluorescence lifetime information. First, we combined pMINFLUX with smFRET. This enabled us to track a FRET donor fluorophore and simultaneously colocalize its FRET acceptor with nanometer precision. To extend co-localized tracking beyond the FRET range, we developed pMINFLUX lifetime multiplexing, a method to simultaneously track two fluorophores with similar spectral properties but distinct fluorescence lifetimes. We demonstrated its application on both static and dynamic DNA origami systems with a precision better than 2 nm. Within the FRET range, pMINFLUX lifetime multiplexing additionally uses a novel combined phasor-microtimegating approach. This paves the way for nanometer precise co-localized tracking for inter-dye distances between 4 nm and 100 nm, closing the resolution gap between smFRET and co-tracking.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=137 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/534096v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (36K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11459forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f1cee2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4592e6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1af3e48_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The lung airways are characterized by long and wide proximal branches and short and thin distal branches. In this study, we investigated the emergence of this hierarchical structure through experimental observations and computational models. We focused on the branch formation in the pseudoglandular stage and examined the response of mouse lung epithelium to fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10) by monitoring extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity. The ERK activity increased depending on the epithelial tissue curvature. This curvature-dependent response decreased as the development progressed. Therefore, to understand how these epithelial changes affect branching morphology, we constructed a computational model of curvature-dependent epithelial growth. We demonstrated that branch length was controlled by the curvature dependence of growth that was consistent with the experimental observations and lung morphology. However, the branching of the thin branches is suppressed in this model, which is inconsistent with the fact that thin branches in the lung are short. Thus, we introduced branch formation by apical constriction, which was shown to be regulated by Wnt signaling in our previous studies. Mathematical analysis indicated that the effect of apical constriction is cell shape-dependent, suggesting that apical constriction ameliorates the branching of thin branches. Finally, we were able to provide clarity on the hierarchical branching structure through an integrated computational model of curvature-dependent growth and cell shape regulation. We proposed that curvature-dependent growth involving FGF and Wnt-mediated cell shape regulation coordinate to control the spatial scale and frequency of branch formation.\n\nStatement of SignificanceThe lung airways exhibit a morphology in which the branch scale continuously decreases toward the distal side. This study explains the mechanism behind the hierarchical branching structure. Computational models proposed that the epithelial growth activity and apical constriction cooperatively determine branch length and tip width, consistent with the experimental observations that epithelial properties change as development progresses. The growth activity and cell shape are regulated by FGF and Wnt signaling, respectively, suggesting the importance of these pathways in patterning branch structures at a different scale. Our study provides a new perspective on the role of epithelial properties in the regulation of the mesoscale structure of the lung via FGF and Wnt signaling, thereby providing an understanding of branching morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Living tissues are characterized by an intrinsically mechano-chemical interplay of active physical forces and complex biochemical signalling pathways. Either feature alone can give rise to complex emergent phenomena, for example mechanically driven glassy dynamics and rigidity transitions, or chemically driven reaction-diffusion instabilities. An important question is how to quantitatively assess the contribution of these different cues to the large-scale dynamics of biological materials. We address this in MDCK monolayers, considering both mechanochemical feedbacks between ERK signalling activity and cellular density as well as a mechanically active tissue rheology via a self-propelled vertex model. We show that the relative strength of active migration forces to mechanochemical couplings controls a transition from uniform active glass to periodic spatiotemporal waves. We parameterize the model from published experimental datasets on MDCK monolayers, and use it to make new predictions on the correlation functions of cellular dynamics and the dynamics of topological defects associated with the oscillatory phase of cells. Interestingly, MDCK monolayers are best described by an intermediary parameter region in which both mechanochemical couplings and noisy active propulsion have a strong influence on the dynamics. Finally, we study how tissue rheology and ERK waves feedback on one another, and uncover a mechanism via which tissue fluidity can be controlled by mechano-chemical waves both at the local and global levels.",

While the impact of chemical signaling on brain cells has been studied in detail, our current understanding of the mechanical signaling in microglia is still limited. To address this challenge, we exposed microglial cells to a single mechanical stretch and compared their behavior to chemical activation by lipopolysaccharide treatment. Here we show that stretching microglial cells results in their activation, demonstrating a strong mechanosensitivity. Stretched microglial cells exhibited higher Iba1 protein levels, a denser actin cytoskeleton and migrated more persistently. In contrary to LPS-treated cells, stretched microglia maintain a robust secretory profile of chemokines and cytokines, except for TNF-, highlighting the relevance of this model. Interestingly, a single stretch injury results in more compacted chromatin and DNA damage, suggesting possible long-term genomic instabilities in stretched microglia. Using neuronal networks in compartmentalized microfluidic chambers, we found that stretched microglial cells exhibit enhanced phagocytic and synaptic stripping activities. Altogether, our results propose that the immune potential of microglial cells can be unlocked by stretching events to maintain brain tissue homeostasis after mechanical injury.",

    "abstract": "Tumor-associated neutrophil (TAN) effects on glioblastoma biology remain under-characterized. We show here that  hybrid neutrophils with dendritic features - including morphological complexity, expression of antigen presentation genes, and the ability to process exogenous peptide and stimulate MHCII-dependent T cell activation - accumulate intratumorally and suppress tumor growth in vivo. Trajectory analysis of patient TAN scRNA-seq identifies this phenotype as a polarization state which is distinct from canonical cytotoxic TANs and differentiates intratumorally from immature precursors absent in circulation. Rather, these hybrid-inducible immature neutrophils - which we identified in patient and murine glioblastomas - arise from local skull marrow. Through labeled skull flap transplantation and targeted ablation, we characterize calvarial marrow as a potent contributor of antitumoral myeloid APCs, including hybrid TANs and dendritic cells, which elicit T cell cytotoxicity and memory. As such, agents augmenting neutrophil egress from skull marrow - such as intracalvarial AMD3100 whose survival prolonging-effect in GBM we demonstrate - present therapeutic potential.",

    "abstract": "The Warburg Effect is characterized by accelerated glycolytic metabolism and lactate production and is a hallmark of cancer cells. Recently, we have demonstrated the role of endogenous, glucose-derived lactate as an oncometabolite which regulates gene expression in the estrogen receptor positive (ER+) MCF7 cell line cultivated in glucose media (San-Millan, Julian et al. 2019). Presently, with the addition of a triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line, MDA-MB-231, we further confirm the effect of lactate on gene expression patterns, but extend results to include lactate effects on protein expression. As well, we report effects of lactate on the expression of E-cadherin and vimentin, proteins associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Endogenous lactate regulates the expression of multiple genes involved in carcinogenesis. In MCF7 cells, lactate increased the expression of EGFR, VEGF HIF-1a, KRAS, MIF, mTOR, PIK3CA, TP53, and CDK4 (The Ital is used for genes) as well as decreased the expression of ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, E2F1, MET, MYC, and RAF mainly at 48h of exposure. On the other hand, in the MDA-MB-231 cell line, lactate increased the expression of PIK3CA, VEGF, EGFR, mTOR, HIF-1, ATM, E2F1, TP53 and decreased the expression of BRCA1, BRCA2, CDK4, CDK6, MET, MIF, MYC, and RAF after 48h of exposure. Protein expression of representative genes corroborated mRNA expressions. Finally, lactate decreased E-cadherin protein expression in MCF7 cells and increased vimentin expression in MDA-MB-231 cells.\n\nIn this study, we demonstrate that endogenous lactate produced under aerobic conditions (Warburg Effect) is capable of eliciting important regulation of gene and protein expression in both ER+ and TNBC cell lines. The regulation of multiple genes by lactate is widespread and involves those involved in carcinogenesis including DNA repair, cell growth, proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Furthermore, both cell lines demonstrated changes in the expression of EMT biomarkers representing a shift to a more mesenchymal phenotype with exposure to endogenous lactate.\n\nSimple SummaryThis study shows how endogenous lactate is a major regulator of key genes involved in two main breast cancer cell types: estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and triple negative breast cancer cells (TPBC). Lactate regulates both gene and protein expression in these cells. Furthermore, lactate is also an important player in the regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process involved in metastasis. Targeting lactate production and exchange within and among cancer cells should offer novel therapeutics opportunities.",

In this study, shared targets of apigenin and CC were identified through different online tools and subjected to functional enrichment analyses like Gene Ontology and KEGG. Further, the protein-protein interaction network of the shared targets was developed (via STRING); hub/core targets were identified (MCODE application). The top targets of apigenin in CC were identified by molecular docking; further investigated for differential gene and protein expression in CC and their influence on CC patient survival (using TCGA data). Based on the docking score of the 13 hub genes, the top 3 targets (HSP90AA1, MMP9, PTGS2) were selected, and their expression was significantly elevated and related to poor overall survival in CC (except PTGS2). Molecular dynamics simulation further validated protein-ligand interactions and selected HSP90AA1 as the best target of apigenin in CC. Finally, apigenin was found to be involved in the cytotoxicity of CC cells (COLO-205) by reducing HSP90AA1 expression. The results of this study identified HSP90AA1 as one of the prime targets of apigenin in CC, and apigenin might act on HSP90AA1 to exert its anti-cancer mechanism.",

SWL-treated seedlings exhibited an impressively high number of DEGs and DMs compared to ST or WL. Although the main common DEGs and DMs showed a neutral pattern, gene ontology enrichment following the classification in different functional categories of SWL-transcripts displayed a predominant synergistic pattern mode. Hierarchical and silhouette analysis regrouped different morpho-physiological clusters following the treatment, SWL was mainly grouped with both single stress. SWL induced a massive shutdown of the photosynthesis apparatus through LHCBs- and PSA-related genes. Starch and plastoglobuli synthesis appeared to be drastically affected by SWL, while ABA content confirmed by ABA synthesis related-genes (ABF, ABA1 and NCED) variations showed a less-needed role. NXN (Nucleoredoxin) genes are the main factors that sustain the antioxidant system under SWL.

    "abstract": "Available research on non-antibiotic alternative growth promoter (NAGPs) mainly focuses on the effect of a single preparation on the substitution effect of antibiotics. However, different NAGP might work together in harmony. Studies related to NAGP combinations are lacking. This study aimed to screen six non-antibiotic alternative growth promoter combinations (NAGPCs) in vitro so as to find a better alternative method to ensure feed efficiency and the broiler health. Pepsin and 42-d broiler ileal fluid were used for the in vitro digestion test, and the optimal addition levels of NAGPs and NAGPCs were selected based on dry matter (DM) and organic matter (OM) digestibility, microbiota of digestive fluid, and antioxidant capacity of digestive fluid. Results showed the optimum addition amount of Mannose oligosaccharide (MOS), fruit oligosaccharide (FOS), mannanase (MAN), Bacillus subtilis (BS), sodium butyrate (SB), guanidinoacetic acid (CA), xylanase (XYL), glucose oxidase (GO), and phytase (PT) were 0.2%, 0.9%, 0.03%, 0.05%, 0.08%, 0.002%, 0.008%, and 0.004%. The six best combinations were 0.2%MOS + 0.03%MAN + 0.15%SB, 0.2%MOS + 0.03%MAN + 0.05%BS, 0.2%MOS + 0.9%FOS + 0.15%SB, 0.2%MOS + 0.9%FOS + 0.05%BS, 0.2%MOS + 0.9%FOS + 0.03%MAN, and 0.2%MOS + 0.05%BS + 0.004%PT. In conclusion, NAGPCs improved the apparent digestibility of ileal DM and OM, intestinal flora and antioxidant capacity. Comparatively, under this condition, using NAGPC has more beneficial effects than using non-antibiotic alternative growth promoter.",

    "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other lentiviruses adapt to new hosts by evolving to evade host-specific innate immune proteins that differ in sequence and often viral recognition between host species. Understanding how these host antiviral proteins, called restriction factors, constrain lentivirus replication and transmission is key to understanding the emergence of pandemic viruses like HIV-1. Human TRIM34, a paralogue of the well-characterized lentiviral restriction factor TRIM5, was previously identified by our lab via CRISPR-Cas9 screening as a restriction factor of certain HIV and SIV capsids. Here, we show that diverse primate TRIM34 orthologues from non-human primates can restrict a range of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) capsids including SIVAGM-SAB, SIVAGM-TAN and SIVMAC capsids, which infect sabaeus monkeys, tantalus monkeys, and rhesus macaques, respectively. All primate TRIM34 orthologues tested, regardless of species of origin, were able to restrict this same subset of viral capsids. However, in all cases, this restriction also required the presence of TRIM5. We demonstrate that TRIM5 is necessary, but not sufficient, for restriction of these capsids, and that human TRIM5 functionally interacts with TRIM34 from different species. Finally, we find that both the TRIM5 SPRY v1 loop and the TRIM34 SPRY domain are essential for TRIM34-mediated restriction. These data support a model in which TRIM34 is a broadly-conserved primate lentiviral restriction factor that acts in tandem with TRIM5, such that together, these proteins can restrict capsids that neither can restrict alone.",

    "abstract": "Genetic monitoring of populations currently attracts interest in the context of the Convention on Biological Diversity but needs long-term planning and investments. Genetic diversity has been largely neglected in biodiversity monitoring, and when addressed is treated separately, detached from other conservation issues, such as habitat alteration due to climate change. Genetic monitoring supports the conservation and management of fisheries, game, and threatened populations. It also can contribute to the assessment of predicted and realized impacts of climate change, and their management. We report the first accounting of genetic monitoring efforts among countries in Europe (their  genetic monitoring capacity, GMC) to determine where GMC suggests the combination of national infrastructure, political support and resources for continued and expanded monitoring. Overlaying GMC with areas where species ranges approach current and future climate niche limits (i.e., niche marginality) helps identify whether GMC coincides with anticipated climate change effects on biodiversity. Our analysis suggests that country area extent, financial resources, and conservation policy influence GMC, high values of which inconsistently match joint species patterns of climate niche marginality. Populations at niche margins likely hold genetic diversity that is important to adaptation to changing climate, and our results illuminate the need in Europe for expanded genetic monitoring across the climate gradients occupied by species, a need arguably greatest in southeastern European countries.",

Here, we studied the molecular epidemiology of the zoonotic disease cutaneous leishmaniasis in Peru and Bolivia through a joint evolutionary analysis of Leishmania braziliensis parasites and their endosymbiotic Leishmania RNA virus. We show that parasite populations circulate in isolated pockets of suitable habitat and are associated with single viral lineages that appear in low prevalence. In contrast, groups of hybrid parasites were geographically and ecologically dispersed, and commonly infected from a pool of genetically diverse viruses. Our results suggest that parasite hybridization, likely due to increased human migration and ecological perturbations, increased the frequency of endosymbiotic interactions known to play a key role in disease severity.",

    "abstract": "A universal feature of living systems is that natural variation in genotype underpins variation in phenotype. Yet, research in model organisms is often constrained to a single genetic background, the reference strain. Further, genomic studies that do evaluate wild strains typically rely on the reference strain genome for read alignment, leading to the possibility of biased inferences based on incomplete or inaccurate mapping; the extent of reference bias can be difficult to quantify. As an intermediary between genome and organismal traits, gene expression is well positioned to describe natural variability across genotypes generally and in the context of environmental responses, which can represent complex adaptive phenotypes. C. elegans sits at the forefront of investigation into small-RNA gene regulatory mechanisms, or RNA interference (RNAi), and wild strains exhibit natural variation in RNAi competency following environmental triggers. Here, we examine how genetic differences among five wild strains affect the C. elegans transcriptome in general and after inducing RNAi responses to two germline target genes. Approximately 34% of genes were differentially expressed across strains; 411 genes were not expressed at all in at least one strain despite robust expression in others, including 49 genes not expressed in reference strain N2. Despite the presence of hyper-diverse hotspots throughout the C. elegans genome, reference mapping bias was of limited concern: over 92% of variably expressed genes were robust to mapping issues. Overall, the transcriptional response to RNAi was strongly strain-specific and highly specific to the target gene, and the laboratory strain N2 was not representative of the other strains. Moreover, the transcriptional response to RNAi was not correlated with RNAi phenotypic penetrance; the two germline RNAi incompetent strains exhibited substantial differential gene expression following RNAi treatment, indicating an RNAi response despite failure to reduce expression of the target gene. We conclude that gene expression, both generally and in response to RNAi, differs across C. elegans strains such that choice of strain may meaningfully influence scientific conclusions. To provide a public, easily accessible resource for querying gene expression variation in this dataset, we introduce an interactive website at https://wildworm.biosci.gatech.edu/rnai/.",

    "abstract": "Microalgae play an essential role in global net primary productivity and global biogeochemical cycling, but despite their phototrophic lifestyle, over half of algal species depend on a supply of the corrinoid vitamin B12 (cobalamin) for growth. This essential organic micronutrient is produced only by a subset of prokaryotic organisms, which implies that for algal species to use this compound, they must first acquire it from external sources. Previous studies have identified protein components involved in vitamin B12 uptake in bacterial species and humans. However, little is known about how it is taken up in algae. Here, we demonstrate the essential role of a protein, CBA1 (for cobalamin acquisition protein 1), in B12 uptake in Phaeodactylum tricornutum, using CRISPR-Cas9 to generate targeted knockouts, and in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, by insertional mutagenesis. In both cases, CBA1 knockout lines are no longer able to take up exogenous vitamin B12. Complementation of the C. reinhardtii mutants with the wildtype CBA1 gene restores B12 uptake, and regulation of CBA1 expression via a riboswitch element can be used to control the phenotype. When visualised by confocal microscopy, a YFP-fusion with C. reinhardtii CBA1 shows association with membranes. A bioinformatics analysis found that CBA1-like sequences are present in all the major eukaryotic phyla. Its presence is correlated with B12-dependent enzymes in many, although not all, taxa, suggesting CBA1 has a conserved role. Our results thus provide insight into the molecular basis of algal B12 acquisition, a process that likely underpins many interactions in aquatic microbial communities.\n\nOne sentence summaryKnockout mutants and physiological studies demonstrate that the CBA1 protein is essential for uptake of vitamin B12 in both Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the unrelated Phaeodactylum tricornutum.",

Z. indianus was first reported in the United States in 2005 and has since been documented as far north as Canada. As a tropical species, Z. indianus is expected to have low cold tolerance, likely limiting its ability to persist at northern latitudes. In North America, the geographic regions where Z. indianus can thrive and seasonal fluctuations in its abundance are not well understood. The purpose of this study was to characterize the temporal and spatial variation in Z. indianus abundance to better understand its invasion of the eastern United States. We sampled drosophilid communities over the growing season at two orchards in Virginia from 2020-2022 and several locations along the East Coast during the fall of 2022. Virginia abundance curves showed similar seasonal dynamics across years with individuals first detected around July and becoming absent around December. Massachusetts was the northernmost population and no Z. indianus were detected in Maine. Variation in Z. indianus relative abundance was high between nearby orchards and across different fruits within orchards but was not correlated with latitude. Fitness of wild-caught females decreased later in the season and at higher latitudes. The patterns of Z. indianus abundance shown here demonstrate an apparent susceptibility to cold and highlight a need for systematic sampling to accurately characterize the range and spread of Z. indianus.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the DNA methylation patterns in the human genome is a key step to decipher gene regulatory mechanisms and model mutation rate heterogeneity in the human genome. While methylation rates can be measured e.g. with bisulfite sequencing, such measures do not capture historical patterns. Here we present a new method, Methylation Hidden Markov Model (MHMM), to estimate the accumulated germline methylation signature in human population history leveraging two properties: (1) Mutation rates of cytosine to thymine transitions at methylated CG dinucleotides are orders of magnitude higher than that in the rest of the genome. (2) Methylation levels are locally correlated, so the allele frequencies of neighboring CpGs can be used jointly to estimate methylation status. We applied MHMM to allele frequencies from the TOPMed and the gnomAD genetic variation catalogs. Our estimates are consistent with whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) measured human germ cell methylation levels at 90% of CpG sites, but we also identified [~] 442, 000 historically methylated CpG sites that could not be captured due to sample genetic variation, and inferred methylation status for [~] 721, 000 CpG sites that were missing from WGBS. Hypo-methylated regions identified by combining our results with experimental measures are 1.7 times more likely to recover known active genomic regions than those identified by WGBS alone. Our estimated historical methylation status can be leveraged to enhance bioinformatic analysis of germline methylation such as annotating regulatory and inactivated genomic regions and provide insights in sequence evolution including predicting mutation constraint.",

    "abstract": "Dinoflagellates in the Family Symbiodiniaceae (Order Suessiales) are diverse, predominantly symbiotic lineages that associate with taxa such as corals and jellyfish. Their ancestor is believed to have been free-living, and the establishment of symbiosis (i.e., symbiogenesis) is hypothesised to have occurred multiple times during Symbiodiniaceae evolution. Among Symbiodiniaceae taxa, the genus Effrenium is an early diverging, free-living lineage that is phylogenetically positioned between two robustly supported groups of genera within which symbiotic taxa have emerged. The lack of symbiogenesis in Effrenium suggests that the ancestral features of Symbiodiniaceae may have been retained in this lineage. Here we present de novo assembled genomes and associated transcriptome data from three isolates of Effrenium voratum. We compared the Effrenium genomes (1.2-1.9 Gbp in size) and gene features with those of 16 Symbiodiniaceae taxa and other outgroup dinoflagellates. Surprisingly, we find that genome reduction, which is often associated with a symbiotic lifestyle, predates the origin of Symbiodiniaceae. We postulate that adaptation to an extreme habitat (e.g., as in Polarella glacialis) or life in oligotrophic conditions resulted in the Suessiales ancestor having a haploid genome size < 2Gbp, which was retained (or reduced) among all extant algae in this lineage. Nonetheless, our data reveal that the free-living lifestyle distinguishes Effrenium from symbiotic Symbiodiniaceae vis-a-vis their longer introns, more-extensive mRNA editing, fewer ([~]30%) lineage-specific gene families, and lower ([~]10%) level of pseudogenisation. These results demonstrate how genome reduction and the adaptation to symbiotic versus free-living lifestyles intersect, and have driven the diversification and genome evolution of Symbiodiniaceae.",

    "abstract": "Telomeres protect chromosome ends from unscheduled DNA repair, including from the MRN (MRE11, RAD50, NBS1) complex, which plays a critical role in the processing of double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs). MRN orchestrates activation of the ATM kinase in the cellular DNA damage response (DDR), promotes DNA end-tethering aiding the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, and initiates DSB resection through the MRE11 nuclease. A previously identified protein motif (MIN, for MRN inhibitor) downregulates MRN activity via binding to RAD50 and has independently arisen at least twice, through convergent evolution of telomeric proteins Rif2 and Taz1, in budding and fission yeast respectively. We now provide a third example of convergent evolution for this binding mechanism for MRN at telomeres, by demonstrating that the iDDR motif of the human shelterin protein TRF2 binds to human RAD50 at the same site engaged by the MIN motif in the yeast proteins, despite lacking sequence homology. Modelling for the human CtIP interaction with RAD50 (necessary for activation of MRE11), and for the budding and fission yeast counterparts Sae2 and Ctp1, indicates that the interaction is mutually exclusive with binding of the iDDR/MIN motifs, pointing to a conserved mechanism for inhibition of MRN nuclease activity at telomeres.",

We have overcome this by preparing an eDNA library via partial digest with restriction enzyme Fatl (cuts CATG), causing a substantial proportion of ATG start codons to be precisely aligned with strong plasmid-encoded promoter and ribosome-binding sequences. Whereas we were unable to select nitroreductases from standard metagenome libraries, our Fatl strategy yielded 21 nitroreductases spanning eight different enzyme families, each conferring resistance to the nitro-antibiotic niclosamide and sensitivity to the nitro-prodrug metronidazole. We showed expression could be improved by co-expressing rare tRNAs and encoded proteins purified directly using an embedded Hisg-tag. In a transgenic zebrafish model of metronidazole-mediated targeted cell ablation, our lead MhqN-family nitroreductase proved [~]5- fold more effective than the canonical nitroreductase NfsB.",

The molecular details of this modification reaction, including the molecular origins of the modification itself, have long eluded understanding. Here, we demonstrate that Mom co-opts the translational machinery of the host by harvesting activated glycine from charged tRNAGly to hypermodify adenine. Based on this insight, we report the first in vitro reconstitution of the Mu hypermodification from purified components. Using isotope labeling, we demonstrate that the carbamoyl nitrogen of the Mom modification is derived from the N6 of adenine, indicating an on-base rearrangement of the N6 aminoacylation product, possibly via a cyclic intermediate.

    "abstract": "Short amphipathic peptides are capable of binding to transcriptional coactivators, often targeting the same binding surfaces as native transcriptional activation domains. However, they do so with modest affinity and generally poor selectivity, limiting their utility as synthetic modulators. Here we show that incorporation of a medium-chain, branched fatty acid to the N-terminus of one such heptameric lipopeptidomimetic (34913-8) increases the affinity for the coactivator Med25 >10-fold (Ki >>100 M to 10 M). Importantly, the selectivity of 34913-8 for Med25 compared to other coactivators is excellent. 34913-8 engages Med25 through interaction with the H2 face of its Activator Interaction Domain and in doing so stabilizes full-length protein in the cellular proteome. Further, genes regulated by Med25-activator PPIs are inhibited in a cell model of triple-negative breast cancer. Thus, 34913-8 is a useful tool for studying Med25 and the Mediator complex biology and the results indicate that lipopeptidomimetics may be a robust source of inhibitors for activator-coactivator complexes.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophages, which naturally shape bacterial communities, can be co-opted as a biological technology to help eliminate pathogenic bacteria from our bodies and food supply1. Phage genome editing is a critical tool to engineer more effective phage technologies. However, editing phage genomes has traditionally been a low efficiency process that requires laborious screening, counter selection, or in vitro construction of modified genomes2. These requirements impose limitations on the type and throughput of phage modifications, which in turn limit our knowledge and potential for innovation. Here, we present a scalable approach for engineering phage genomes using recombitrons: modified bacterial retrons3 that generate recombineering donor DNA paired with single stranded binding and annealing proteins to integrate those donors into phage genomes. This system can efficiently create genome modifications in multiple phages without the need for counterselection. Moreover, the process is continuous, with edits accumulating in the phage genome the longer the phage is cultured with the host, and multiplexable, with different editing hosts contributing distinct mutations along the genome of a phage in a mixed culture. In lambda phage, as an example, recombitrons yield single-base substitutions at up to 99% efficiency and up to 5 distinct mutations installed on a single phage genome, all without counterselection and only a few hours of hands-on time.",

    "abstract": "Complex mechanisms regulate the cellular distribution of cholesterol, a critical component of eukaryote membranes involved in regulation of membrane protein functions directly and through the physiochemical properties of membranes. StarD4, a member of the steroidogenic acute regulator-related lipid-transfer (StART) domain (StARD)-containing protein family, is a highly efficient sterol-specific transfer protein involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Its mechanism of cargo loading and release remains unknown despite recent insights into the key role of phosphatidylinositol phosphates in modulating its interactions with target membranes. We have used large-scale atomistic Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study how the dynamics of cholesterol bound to the StarD4 protein can affect interaction with target membranes, and cargo delivery. We identify the two major cholesterol (CHL) binding modes in the hydrophobic pocket of StarD4, one near S136&S147 (the Ser-mode), and another closer to the putative release gate located near W171, R92&Y117 (the Trp-mode). We show that conformational changes of StarD4 associated directly with the transition between these binding modes facilitate the opening of the gate. To understand the dynamics of this connection we apply a machine-learning algorithm for the detection of rare events in MD trajectories (RED), which reveals the structural motifs involved in the opening of a front gate and a back corridor in the StarD4 structure occurring together with the spontaneous transition of CHL from the Ser-mode of binding to the Trp-mode. Further analysis of MD trajectory data with the information-theory based NbIT method reveals the allosteric network connecting the CHL binding site to the functionally important structural components of the gate and corridor. Mutations of residues in the allosteric network are shown to affect the performance of the allosteric connection. These findings outline an allosteric mechanism which prepares the CHL-bound StarD4 to release and deliver the cargo when it is bound to the target membrane.",

Our method delivers 2D intensity and temporal profiles, enabling the distinction of sub-populations in mixed samples. Strikingly, we observe a linear relationship between passage time and molecular radius, unlocking the potential to gather crucial information about diffusion and solution-phase conformation. Furthermore, mixtures of biomolecule isomers of the same molecular weight can also be resolved.

In healthy subjects, we found significant differences in cytokine levels, leukocyte phenotypes, and gene expression. Transcriptional responses also varied by cohort, and the most significant determinant was ancestry. In influenza infected subjects, we found two disease severity immunophenotypes, largely driven by age. Additionally, cytokine regression models show each determinant differentially contributes to acute immune variation, with unique and interactive, location-specific herpesvirus effects.

    "abstract": "The intestine is the primary colonisation site for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and serves as a reservoir of CRE that cause invasive infections (e.g. bloodstream infections). Antibiotics disrupt colonisation resistance mediated by the gut microbiota, promoting the expansion of CRE within the intestine. We used ex vivo faecal cultures to measure the impact of antibiotics (that promote CRE intestinal colonisation) on the faecal microbiota from healthy human donors. We demonstrated that antibiotics decreased the abundance of gut commensals (including Bifidobacteriaceae and Bacteroidales) in human faecal microbiota, resulting in an enrichment of nutrients and a depletion of microbial metabolites. We measured the nutrient utilisation abilities, nutrient preferences, and metabolite inhibition susceptibilities of several carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae strains, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter hormaechei. Nutrients (which were elevated with antibiotics) acted as carbon and nitrogen sources to support CRE growth, where CRE strains showed an ordered preference for specific nutrients. These nutrients were also increased in faeces from antibiotic-treated mice but decreased following intestinal colonisation with carbapenem-resistant E. coli. Microbial metabolites (which decreased with antibiotics) were inhibitory towards CRE growth in vitro. Carbapenem-resistant E. coli growth was decreased in faecal samples from mice treated with a mixture of inhibitory metabolites compared with PBS-treated mice. These findings demonstrated that killing gut commensals with antibiotics disrupts colonisation resistance by enriching nutrients that support CRE growth and depleting metabolites that inhibit CRE growth. These results support the development of new microbiome therapeutics to prevent CRE intestinal colonisation, which would also prevent the subsequent development of invasive CRE infections.",

The majority of mutations in pBI143 accumulate in specific positions across thousands of metagenomes, indicating strong purifying selection. pBI143 is monoclonal in most individuals, likely due to the priority effect of the version first acquired, often from ones mother. pBI143 can transfer between Bacteroidales and although it does not appear to impact bacterial host fitness in vivo, can transiently acquire additional genetic content.

    "abstract": "Cell-cell communication is mediated by membrane receptors and their cognate ligands, such as the Eph/ephrin system, and dictates physiological processes, including cell proliferation and migration. However, whether and how Eph/ephrin signaling culminates in transcriptional regulation is largely unknown. Epigenetic mechanisms are key for integrating external \"signals\", e.g., from neighboring cells, into the transcriptome. We have previously reported that ephrinA5 stimulation of immortalized cerebellar granule (CB) cells elicits transcriptional changes of lncRNAs and protein-coding genes. LncRNAs represent important adaptors for epigenetic writers through which they regulate gene expression. Here, we investigate the interaction of lncRNA with protein-coding genes by the combined power of in silico modeling of RNA/DNA interactions and respective wet lab approaches, in the context of ephrinA5-dependent regulation of cellular motility. We found that Snhg15, a cancer-related lncRNA, forms a triplex structure with the Ncam1 promoter and interacts with DNMT1. EphrinA5 stimulation leads to reduced Snhg15 expression, diminished Snhg15/DNMT1 interaction and decreased DNMT1 association with the Ncam1 promoter. These findings can explain the attenuated Ncam1 promoter methylation and elevated Ncam1 expression that in turn elicits decreased cell motility of CB cells.

    "abstract": "Protein phosphorylation is an essential regulatory mechanism that controls most cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, cell division, and response to extracellular stimuli, among many others, and is deregulated in many diseases. Protein phosphorylation is coordinated by the opposing activities of protein kinases and protein phosphatases. In eukaryotic cells, most serine/threonine phosphorylation sites are dephosphorylated by members of the Phosphoprotein Phosphatase (PPP) family. However, we only know for a few phosphorylation sites which specific PPP dephosphorylates them. Although natural compounds such as calyculin A and okadaic acid inhibit PPPs at low nanomolar concentrations, no selective chemical PPP inhibitors exist. Here, we demonstrate the utility of endogenous tagging of genomic loci with an auxin-inducible degron (AID) as a strategy to investigate specific PPP signaling. Using Protein Phosphatase 6 (PP6) as an example, we demonstrate how rapidly inducible protein degradation can be employed to identify dephosphorylation SITES and elucidate PP6 biology. Using genome editing, we introduce AID-tags into each allele of the PP6 catalytic subunit (PP6c) in DLD-1 cells expressing the auxin receptor Tir1. Upon rapid auxin-induced degradation of PP6c, we perform quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics and phosphoproteomics to identify PP6 substrates in mitosis. PP6 is an essential enzyme with conserved roles in mitosis and growth signaling. Consistently, we identify candidate PP6c-dependent phosphorylation sites on proteins implicated in coordinating the mitotic cell cycle, cytoskeleton, gene expression, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Hippo signaling. Finally, we demonstrate that PP6c opposes the activation of large tumor suppressor 1 (LATS1) by dephosphorylating Threonine 35 (T35) on Mps One Binder (MOB1), thereby blocking the interaction of MOB1 and LATS1. Our analyses highlight the utility of combining genome engineering, inducible degradation, and multiplexed phosphoproteomics to investigate signaling by individual PPPs on a global level, which is currently limited by the lack of tools for specific interrogation.",

    "abstract": "Microbial consortia exhibit complex functional properties in contexts ranging from soils to bioreactors to human hosts. Understanding how community composition determines emergent function is a major goal of microbial ecology. Here we address this challenge using the concept of community-function landscapes - analogs to fitness landscapes - that capture how changes in community composition alter collective function. Using datasets that represent a broad set of community functions, from production/degradation of specific compounds to biomass generation, we show that statistically-inferred landscapes quantitatively predict community functions from knowledge of strain presence or absence. Crucially, community-function landscapes allow prediction without explicit knowledge of abundance dynamics or interactions between species, and can be accurately trained using measurements from a small subset of all possible community compositions. The success of our approach arises from the fact that empirical community-function landscapes are typically not rugged, meaning that they largely lack high-order epistatic contributions that would be difficult to fit with limited data. Finally, we show this observation is generic across many ecological models, suggesting community-function landscapes can be applied broadly across many contexts. Our results open the door to the rational design of consortia without detailed knowledge of abundance dynamics or interactions.",

    "abstract": "The microbiome expresses a variety of functions that influence host biology. The range of functions depends on composition of the microbiome, which itself can change during the lifetime of the host as a consequence of neutral assembly processes, host-mediated selection, and/or environmental conditions. To date, the exact dynamics of microbiome assembly, the underlying determinants as well as the resulting effects on host-associated functions are not always well understood. Here, we used the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and a defined community of fully sequenced, naturally associated bacteria to study microbiome dynamics and functions across the lifetime of individual hosts under controlled experimental conditions. By applying the neutral and null models, we demonstrate that bacterial community composition initially shows strongly declining levels of stochasticity, which, however, increase during late worm life, suggesting the action of random assembly processes in aged hosts following first colonization of C. elegans. The adult microbiome is enriched in strains of the genera Ochrobactrum and Enterobacter in comparison to the direct substrate and a host-free control environment. Using pathway analysis, metabolic, and ecological modelling, we further found that the lifetime assembly dynamics lead to an increase in gut-associated functions in the host-associated microbiome, possibly indicating that the initially colonizing bacteria are beneficial for the worm. Overall, our study introduces a framework for studying microbiome assembly dynamics based on the stochastic models and inference of functions, yielding new insights into the processes determining host-associated microbiome composition and function.\n\nImportanceThe microbiome plays a crucial role in host biology, with its functions depending on microbiome composition that can change during a hosts lifetime. To date, the dynamics of microbiome assembly and the resulting functions are not well understood. This study introduces a new approach to characterize the functional consequences of microbiome assembly by modelling both, the relevance of stochastic processes and metabolic characteristics of microbial community changes. The approach was applied to experimental time series data, obtained for the microbiome of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The results revealed significant differences in host-associated and environmental microbiomes. Stochastic processes only played a minor role, and the host showed an increase in beneficial bacteria and an enrichment of gut-associated functions, possibly indicating that the host actively shapes composition of its microbiome.

Identifying the primary magnetosensor remains a fundamental open question. Cryptochromes (Cry) have been shown to be magnetically sensitive, specifically Cry4 shows enhanced magnetic sensitivity in migratory songbirds compared to resident species. Here, we investigate cryptochromes and their potential involvement in magnetoreception in a phylogenetic framework, integrating molecular evolutionary analyses with protein dynamics modeling. We base our analysis on 363 bird genomes and associate different selection regimes with migratory behaviour. We show that Cry4 is characterized by strong positive selection and high variability, typical characteristics of sensor proteins. We identify key sites that likely facilitated the evolution of a highly optimized sensory protein for night time compass orientation in songbirds and a potential functional shift or specialisation. Additionally, we show that Cry4 was lost in hummingbirds, parrots and Tyranni (Suboscines) and thus identified a natural comparative gene knockout, which can be used to test the function of Cry4 in birds. In contrast, the other two cryptochromes Cry1 and Cry2, were highly conserved in all species, indicating basal, non-sensory functions. Our results strengthen the hypothesised role of Cry4 as sensor protein in (night)-migratory songbirds.",

    "abstract": "Chemokine receptors are members of the rhodopsin-like class A GPCRs whose signaling through G proteins drives the directional movement of cells in response to a chemokine gradient. Chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR5 have been extensively studied due to their roles in white blood cell development and inflammation and their status as coreceptors for HIV-1 infection, among other functions. Both receptors form dimers or oligomers but the function/s of self-associations are unclear. While CXCR4 has been crystallized in a dimeric arrangement, available atomic resolution structures of CCR5 are monomeric. To investigate the dimerization interfaces of these chemokine receptors, we used a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC)-based screen and deep mutational scanning to find mutations that modify receptor self-association. Many disruptive mutations promoted self-associations nonspecifically, suggesting they aggregated in the membrane. A mutationally intolerant region was found on CXCR4 that matched the crystallographic dimer interface, supporting this dimeric arrangement in living cells. A mutationally intolerant region was also observed on the surface of CCR5 by transmembrane helices 3 and 4. Mutations from the deep mutational scan that reduce BiFC were validated and were localized in the transmembrane domains as well as the C-terminal cytoplasmic tails where they reduced lipid microdomain localization. The reduced self-association mutants of CXCR4 had increased binding to the ligand CXCL12 but diminished calcium signaling. There was no change in syncytia formation with cells expressing HIV-1 Env. The data highlight that multiple mechanisms are involved in self-association of chemokine receptor chains.",

    "abstract": "The release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) from actin filaments constitutes a key step in their regulated turnover, which is fundamental to many cellular functions. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying Pi release from both the core and barbed end of actin filaments remain unclear. Here, we combine cryo-EM with molecular dynamics simulations and in vitro reconstitution to demonstrate how actin releases Pi through a  molecular backdoor. While constantly open at the barbed end, the backdoor is predominantly closed in filament-core subunits and only opens transiently through concerted backbone movements and rotameric rearrangements of residues close to the nucleotide binding pocket. This mechanism explains why Pi escapes rapidly from the filament end and yet slowly from internal actin subunits. In an actin variant associated with nemaline myopathy, the backdoor is predominantly open in filament-core subunits, resulting in greatly accelerated Pi release after polymerization and filaments with drastically shortened ADP-Pi caps. This demonstrates that the Pi release rate from F-actin is controlled by steric hindrance through the backdoor rather than by the disruption of the ionic bond between Pi and Mg2+ at the nucleotide-binding site. Our results provide the molecular basis for Pi release from actin and exemplify how a single, disease-linked point mutation distorts the nucleotide state distribution and atomic structure of the actin filament.",

To capitalize on this opportunity, new methods are needed to accelerate the different steps required to manufacture and handle engineered cells. Here, we describe the development of an integrated software and hardware platform to automate Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS), a central step for the selection of cells displaying desired molecular attributes. Sorting large numbers of samples is laborious, and, to date, no automated system exists to sequentially manage FACS samples, likely owing to the need to tailor sorting conditions (\"gating\") to each individual sample. Our platform is built around a commercial instrument and integrates the handling and transfer of samples to and from the instrument, autonomous control of the instruments software, and the algorithmic generation of sorting gates, resulting in walkaway functionality. Automation eliminates operator errors, standardizes gating conditions by eliminating operator-to-operator variations, and reduces hands-on labor by 93%. Moreover, our strategy for automating the operation of a commercial instrument control software in the absence of an Application Program Interface (API) exemplifies a universal solution for other instruments that lack an API. Our software and hardware designs are fully open-source and include step-by-step build documentation to contribute to a growing open ecosystem of tools for high-throughput cell biology.",

Here, we examine the nonlinear elastic behavior of blood clots by combining microscopy and rheological measurements with an elastic network model that accounts for the stretching, bending, and buckling of constituent fibrin fibers. We show that the inhibition of fibrin crosslinking reduces fiber bending stiffness and introduces an atypical fiber buckling-induced softening regime at intermediate shear, before the well-characterized stiffening regime. We also show that crosslinking and platelet contraction significantly alter force propagation in the network in a strain-dependent manner. Our mechanics-based model, supported by experiments, provides a framework to understand the origins of characteristic and anomalous regimes of non-linear elastic response not only in blood clots, but also more generally in active biopolymer networks.",

    "abstract": "Voltage-gated sodium channels are heterotetrameric sodium selective ion channels that play a central role in electrical signaling in excitable cells. With recent advances in structural biology, structures of eukaryotic sodium channels have been captured in several distinct conformations corresponding to different functional states. The secondary structure of the pore lining S6 helices of subunit DI, DII, and DIV has been captured with both short {pi}-helix stretches and in fully -helical conformations. The relevance of these secondary structure elements for pore gating is not yet understood. Here, we propose that a {pi} helix in at least DI-S6, DIII-S6, and DIV-S6 results in a fully conductive state. On the other hand, the absence of {pi}-helix in either DI-S6 or DIV-S6 yields a sub-conductance state, and its absence from both DI-S6 and DIV-S6 yields a non-conducting state. This work highlights the impact of the presence of a {pi}-helix in the different S6 helices of an expanded pore on pore conductance, thus opening new doors towards reconstructing the entire conformational landscape along the functional cycle of Nav Channels and paving the way to the design of state-dependent modulators.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=151 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/534196v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1690f87org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7a97faorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8facb1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@92b36c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction underlies several chronic diseases. Dietary interventions can reverse metabolic declines and slow aging but remaining compliant is difficult. 17-estradiol (17-E2) treatment improves metabolic parameters and slows aging in male mice without inducing significant feminization. We recently reported that estrogen receptor  is required for the majority of 17-E2-mediated benefits in male mice, but that 17-E2 also attenuates fibrogenesis in liver, which is regulated by estrogen receptor {beta} (ER{beta})-expressing hepatic stellate cells (HSC). The current studies sought to determine if 17-E2-mediated benefits on systemic and hepatic metabolism are ER{beta}-dependent. We found that 17-E2 treatment reversed obesity and related systemic metabolic sequela in both male and female mice, but this was partially blocked in female, but not male, ER{beta}KO mice. ER{beta} ablation in male mice attenuated 17-E2-mediated benefits on hepatic stearoyl-coenyzme A desaturase 1 (SCD1) and transforming growth factor {beta}1 (TGF-{beta}1) production, which play critical roles in HSC activation and liver fibrosis. We also found that 17-E2 treatment suppresses SCD1 production in cultured hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells, indicating that 17-E2 directly signals in both cell-types to suppress drivers of steatosis and fibrosis. We conclude that ER{beta} partially controls 17-E2-mediated benefits on systemic metabolic regulation in female, but not male, mice, and that 17-E2 likely signals through ER{beta} in HSCs to attenuate pro-fibrotic mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of whooping cough (pertussis), the respiratory disease caused by Bordetella pertussis (BP) has increased in recent years, and it is suspected that the switch from whole-cell pertussis (wP) to acellular pertussis (aP) vaccines may be a contributing factor to the rise in morbidity. While a growing body of evidence indicates that T cells play a role in the control and prevention of symptomatic disease, nearly all data on human BP-specific T cells is related to the four antigens contained in the aP vaccines, and data detailing T cell responses to additional non-aP antigens, are lacking. Here, we derived a full-genome map of human BP-specific CD4+ T cell responses using a high-throughput ex vivo Activation Induced Marker (AIM) assay, to screen a peptide library spanning over 3000 different BP ORFs. First, our data show that BP specific-CD4+ T cells are associated with a large and previously unrecognized breadth of responses, including hundreds of targets. Notably, fifteen distinct non-aP vaccine antigens were associated with reactivity comparable to that of the aP vaccine antigens. Second, the overall pattern and magnitude of CD4+ T cell reactivity to aP and non-aP vaccine antigens was similar regardless of aP vs wP childhood vaccination history, suggesting that the profile of T cell reactivity in adults is not driven by vaccination, but rather is likely driven by subsequent asymptomatic or sub-clinical infections. Finally, while aP vaccine responses were Th1/Th2 polarized as a function of childhood vaccination, CD4+ T cell responses to non-aP BP antigens vaccine responses were not, suggesting that these antigens could be used to avoid the Th2 bias associated with aP vaccination. Overall, these findings enhance our understanding of human T cell responses against BP and suggest potential targets for designing next-generation pertussis vaccines.",

    "abstract": "The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (RB) interacts physically and functionally with a number of epigenetic modifying enzymes to control transcriptional regulation, respond to replication stress, promote DNA damage response and repair pathways, and regulate genome stability. To better understand how disruption of RB function impacts epigenetic regulation of genome stability and determine whether such changes may represent exploitable weaknesses of RB-deficient cancer cells, we performed an imaging-based screen to identify epigenetic inhibitors that promote DNA damage and compromise viability of RB-deficient cells. We found that loss of RB alone leads to high levels of replication-dependent poly-ADP ribosylation (PARylation) and that preventing PARylation through inhibition of PARP enzymes enables RB-deficient cells to progress to mitosis with unresolved replication stress and under-replicated DNA. These defects contribute to high levels of DNA damage, decreased proliferation, and compromised cell viability. We demonstrate this sensitivity is conserved across a panel of inhibitors that target both PARP1 and PARP2 and can be suppressed by re-expression of the RB protein. Together, these data indicate that inhibitors of PARP1 and PARP2 may be clinically relevant for RB-deficient cancers.",

    "abstract": "Speciation occurs when gene pools differentiate between populations, but that differentiation is heterogeneous across the genome. Understanding what parts of the genome are more prone to differentiation is a key mission in evolutionary biology because it can identify genomic regions and evolutionary processes central to the speciation process. Here, we study genomic variation among three closely related species of North American woodpecker: red-breasted, red-naped, and yellow-bellied sapsuckers. We construct a new sapsucker reference genome and use whole genome resequencing to measure genetic variation among these species and to quantify how the level of differentiation between these forms varies across the genome. We find that regions of high relative differentiation between species (FST) tend to have low absolute differentiation between species ({pi}B), indicating that regions of high relative differentiation often have more recent between-population coalescence times than regions of low relative differentiation do. Most of the high-FST genomic windows are found on the Z chromosome, indicating this sex chromosome is particularly important in sapsucker speciation. We show that LD is high across the Z chromosome and that each species tends to have a unique Z haploblock, a pattern suggestive of chromosomal inversions. These results are consistent with a model of speciation in which selective sweeps of globally advantageous variants spread among partly differentiated populations, followed by differential local adaptation of those same genomic regions. We propose that sapsucker speciation may occur primarily via this process occurring on the Z chromosomes, followed by epistatic interactions between Z haploblocks.",

    "abstract": "Likelihood ratios are frequently utilized as basis for statistical tests, for model selection criteria and for assessing parameter and prediction uncertainties, e.g. using the profile likelihood. However, translating these likelihood ratios into p-values or confidence intervals requires the exact form of the test statistics distribution. The lack of knowledge about this distribution for nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE) models requires an approximation which assumes the so-called asymptotic setting, i.e. a sufficiently large amount of data. Since the amount of data from quantitative molecular biology is typically limited in applications, this finite-sample case regularly occurs for mechanistic models of dynamical systems, e.g. biochemical reaction networks or infectious disease models. Thus, it is unclear whether the standard approach of using statistical thresholds derived for the asymptotic large-sample setting in realistic applications results in valid conclusions. In this study, empirical likelihood ratios for parameters from 19 published nonlinear ODE benchmark models are investigated using a resampling approach for the original data designs. Their distributions are compared to the asymptotic approximation and statistical thresholds are checked for conservativeness. It turns out, that corrections of the likelihood ratios in such finite-sample applications are required in order to avoid anti-conservative results.\n\nAuthor summaryStatistical methods based on the likelihood ratio are ubiquitous in mathematical modelling in systems biology. For example confidence intervals of estimated parameters rely on the statistical properties of the likelihood-ratio test. However, it is often overlooked that these intervals sizes rely on assumptions on the amounts of data, which are regularly violated in typical applications in systems biology. By checking the appropriateness of these assumptions in models from the literature, this study shows that in a surprisingly large fraction confidence intervals might be too small. Using a geometric interpretation of parameter estimation in the so-called data space, it is motivated why these issues appear and how they depend on the identifiability of the model parameters. In order to avoid such problematic situations, this work makes suggestions on how to adapt the statistical threshold values for likelihood-ratio test. By this, it can be assured that valid statistical conclusions are drawn from the analysis, also in situations where only smaller data sets are available. Such corrections yield for example more conservative confidence interval sizes and thus decrease a potential underestimation of the parameter uncertainty.",
