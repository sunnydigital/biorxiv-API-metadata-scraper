    "abstract": "AbstractAccurately benchmarking small variant calling accuracy is critical for the continued improvement of human whole genome sequencing. In this work, we show that current variant calling evaluations are biased towards certain variant representations and may misrepresent the relative performance of different variant calling pipelines. We propose solutions, first exploring the affine gap parameter design space for complex variant representation and suggesting a standard. Next, we present our tool \"vcfdist\" and demonstrate the importance of enforcing local phasing for evaluation accuracy. We then introduce the notion of partial credit for mostly-correct calls and present an algorithm for clustering dependent variants. Lastly, we motivate using alignment distance metrics to supplement precision-recall curves for understanding variant calling performance. We evaluate the performance of 64 phased \"Truth Challenge V2\" submissions and show that vcfdist improves measured (SNP, INDEL) performance consistency across variant representations from R2 = (0.14542, 0.97243) for baseline vcfeval to (0.99999, 0.99996) for vcfdist.",

    "abstract": "SummaryZygosityPredictor provides functionality to evaluate how many copies of a gene are affected by mutations in next generation sequencing data. In cancer samples, both somatic and germline mutations are accurately processed. In particular, ZygosityPredictor computes the number of affected copies for single nucleotide variants and small insertions and deletions (Indels). In addition, the tool integrates information at gene level by performing haplotype phasing and subsequent logic to derive how strongly a gene is affected by mutations. This information is of particular interest in precision oncology, e.g. when assessing whether unmutated copies of tumor-suppressor genes remain.\n\nAvailability and implementationZygosityPredictor was implemented as an R-package and is available via Bioconductor at https://bioconductor.org/packages/ZygosityPredictor.

    "abstract": "Spatially resolved transcriptomics performs high-throughput measurement of transcriptomes while preserving spatial information about the cellular organizations. However, many spatially resolved transcriptomic technologies can only distinguish spots consisting of a mixture of cells instead of working at single-cell resolution. Here, we present STdGCN, a graph neural network model designed for cell type deconvolution of spatial transcriptomic (ST) data that can leverage abundant single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data as reference. STdGCN is the first model incorporating the expression profiles from single cell data as well as the spatial localization information from the ST data for cell type deconvolution. Extensive benchmarking experiments on multiple ST datasets showed that STdGCN outperformed 14 published state-of-the-art models. Applied to a human breast cancer Visium dataset, STdGCN discerned spatial distributions between stroma, lymphocytes and cancer cells for tumor microenvironment dissection. In a human heart ST dataset, STdGCN detected the changes of potential endothelial-cardiomyocyte communications during tissue development.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe rapid growth in the number and application of high-throughput \"omics\" technologies has created a need for better methods to integrate multiomics data sets. Much progress has been made in developing unsupervised methods, but supervised methods have lagged behind.\n\nResultsWe develop a novel algorithm, plasma, to train and validate models to predict time-to-event outcomes from multiomics data sets. The model is built on using two layers of the existing partial least squares algorithm to first select components that covary with the outcome in order to construct a joint Cox proportional hazards model. We apply plasma to the lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our model successfully separates an independent test data set into high risk and low risk patients (p = 0.0132). The performance of the joint multiomics model is superior to that of the individual omics data sets. It is also superior to the performance of an approach that uses an unsupervised method (Multi Omics Factor Analysis; MOFA) to find factors that might work as predictors. Many of the factors that contribute strongly to the plasma model can be justified from the biological literature.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationThe plasma R package can be obtained from The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plasma/index.html.

    "abstract": "Single-cell multiomic analysis of the epigenome, transcriptome and proteome allows for comprehensive characterisation of the molecular circuitry that underpins cell identity, cell state, and cell type-specific gene regulatory networks. Technological advances, whereby multiple omics modalities can be simultaneously profiled in individual cells in a highly parallel manner, are already beginning to provide a step-change in our capacity to comprehend complex tissue biology during development and ageing, in health and disease, and upon treatment. However, the holistic interpretation of such datasets still presents a challenge due to an absence of approaches for the systematic joint analysis and evaluation of different modalities. Here, we present Panpipes, a set of computational workflows designed to automate the analysis of multimodal single-cell datasets by incorporating widely used Python-based tools to efficiently perform quality control, preprocessing, integration, clustering, and reference mapping at scale in the multiomic setting. Panpipes combines established and state-of-the-art methods to allow reliable and customisable analysis and evaluation of multiomic single-cell datasets, enabling users to investigate individual and integrated modalities, and to empower decision-making prior to downstream analyses and data interpretation.",

    "abstract": "Real-time database searching allows for simpler and automated proteomics workflows as it eliminates technical bottlenecks in high throughput experiments. Most importantly, it enables results dependent acquisition (RDA) where search results can be used to guide data acquisition during acquisition. This is especially beneficial for glycoproteomics since the wide range of physicochemical properties of glycopeptides lead to a wide range of optimal acquisition parameters. We established here the GlycoPaSER prototype by extending the Parallel Search Engine in Real-time (PaSER) functionality for real-time glycopeptide identification from fragmentation spectra. Glycopeptide fragmentation spectra were decomposed into peptide- and glycan-moiety spectra using common N-glycan fragments. Each moiety was subsequently identified by a specialized algorithm running in real-time. GlycoPaSER can keep up with the rate of data acquisition for real-time analysis with similar performance to other glycoproteomics software and produces results that are in line with literature reference data. The GlycoPaSER prototype presented here provides the first proof-of-concept for real-time glycopeptide identification that unlocks future development of RDA technology to transcend data acquisition.",

Yet these data lack information about the scale (i.e., size) of the biological system under study, leading some authors to call these data compositional (i.e., proportional). In this article we show that commonly used DSA methods make strong, implicit assumptions about the unmeasured system scale. We show that even small errors in these assumptions can lead to false positive rates as high as 70%. To mitigate this problem, we introduce a sensitivity analysis framework to identify when modeling results are robust to such errors and when they are suspect. Unlike standard benchmarking studies, our methods do not require ground-truth knowledge and can therefore be applied to both simulated and real data.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAging, Western diet (WD) intake, and bile acid (BA) receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) inactivation are risk factors for metabolic disease development including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and chronic inflammation-related health issues such as dementia. The progression of the metabolic disease can be escalated when those risks are combined. Inactivation of FXR is cancer prone in both humans and mice. The current study used omics data generated within the gut-liver axis to classify those risks using bioinformatics and machine learning approaches.\n\nMethodsDifferent ages (5, 10, and 15 months) of wild-type (WT) and FXR knockout (KO) male mice were fed with either a healthy control diet (CD) or a WD since weaning. Hepatic transcripts, liver, serum, and urine metabolites, hepatic bile acids (BAs), as well as gut microbiota were used for risk prediction. A linear support vector machine with K-fold cross-validation was used for classification and feature selection.\n\nResultsIncreased urine sucrose alone achieved 91% accuracy in predicting WD intake. Hepatic lithocholic acid (LCA) and serum pyruvate had 100% and 95% accuracy, respectively to classify age. Association analyses showed hepatic LCA was positively associated with serum concentrations of acetone, a ketone body, and 1,3-dihydroxyacetone (DHA), but negatively correlated with serum pyruvate. Urine metabolites (decreased creatinine and taurine as well as increased succinate) or gut microbiota (increased Dorea, Dehalobacterium, and Oscillospira) could predict FXR functional status with greater than 90% accuracy. Integrated pathway analyses revealed that the predictors for diet and FXR expression were implicated in the central carbon metabolism in cancer. To assess the translational relevance, mouse hepatic transcripts were crosschecked with human NAFLD and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) datasets. WD-affected hepatic Cyp39a1 and Gramd1b expression were associated with human HCC and NAFLD, respectively. The metabolites and diseases interaction analyses uncovered that the identified features are implicated in human metabolic diseases, mental disorders, and cancer.\n\nConclusionThe risk prediction using mouse models contributes to the identification of noninvasive biomarkers for early diagnosis of metabolic disease development.",

    "abstract": "Endogenous biomolecular condensates, comprised of a multitude of proteins and RNAs, can organize into multiphasic structures, with compositionally-distinct phases. This multiphasic organization is generally understood to be critical for facilitating their proper biological function. However, the biophysical principles driving multiphase formation are not completely understood. Here, we utilize in vivo condensate reconstitution experiments and coarse-grained molecular simulations to investigate how oligomerization and sequence interactions modulate multiphase organization in biomolecular condensates. We demonstrate that increasing the oligomerization state of an intrinsically disordered protein region (IDR) results in enhanced immiscibility and multiphase formation. Interestingly, we found that oligomerization tunes the miscibility of IDRs in an asymmetric manner, with the effect being more pronounced when the IDR exhibiting stronger homotypic IDR interactions is oligomerized. Our findings suggest that oligomerization is a flexible biophysical mechanism which cells can exploit to tune the internal organization of biomolecular condensates and their associated biological functions.",

We then successfully screened a natural product library using a high throughput model with COL2A1-Gaussia luciferase primary human chondrocyte reporter cells in 3D aggregates under physioxia.

However, the lack of a thorough and organized understanding of phage-body interactions has limited its clinical application.\n\nMethodsHere, we administered different purified phages (Salmonella phage SE_SZW1, Acinetobacter phage AB_SZ6, and Pseudomonas phage PA_LZ7) intravenously to healthy animals (rats and monkeys) to evaluate the phage-induced host responses and phage pharmacokinetics (PK) with different intravenous (IV) doses in healthy animals. The plasma and the organs were sampled after different IV doses to determine the phage biodistribution, the phage-induced cytokines, and antibodies. The potential side effects of phages on animals were assessed.\n\nResultsA non-compartment model revealed that the plasma phage titer gradually decreased over time following a single dose. Repeated doses caused that the plasma phage titer at 5 minutes dropped 2-3 Log10 compared to the first dose regardless of phage types in rats. Host innate immune responses were activated including the upregulated expression (>10-fold) of TNF- and splenic enlargement following repeated doses. Phage-specific neutralization antibodies in animals receiving phages were detected. Similar results were obtained from monkeys.\n\nConclusionsThe mammalian bodies were well-tolerant to the administered phages.

    "abstract": "Highly homologous members of the Gi family, Gi1-3, have distinct tissue distributions and physiological functions, yet the functional properties of these proteins with respect to GDP/GTP binding and regulation of adenylate cyclase are very similar. We recently identified PDZ-RhoGEF (PRG) as a novel Gi1 effector, however, it is poorly activated by Gi2. Here, in a proteomic proximity labeling screen we observed a strong preference for Gi1 relative to Gi2 with respect to engagement of a broad range of potential targets. We investigated the mechanistic basis for this selectivity using PRG as a representative target. Substitution of either the helical domain (HD) from Gi1 into Gi2 or substitution of a single amino acid, A230 in Gi2 to the corresponding D in Gi1, largely rescues PRG activation and interactions with other Gi targets. Molecular dynamics simulations combined with Bayesian network models revealed that in the GTP bound state, dynamic separation at the HD-Ras-like domain (RLD) interface is prevalent in Gi2 relative to Gi1 and that mutation of A230s4h3.3 to D in Gi2 stabilizes HD-RLD interactions through formation of an ionic interaction with R145HD.11 in the HD. These interactions in turn modify the conformation of Switch III. These data support a model where D229s4h3.3 in Gi1 interacts with R144HD.11 stabilizes a network of interactions between HD and RLD to promote protein target recognition. The corresponding A230 in Gi2 is unable to form the \"ionic lock\" to stabilize this network leading to an overall lower efficacy with respect to target interactions. This study reveals distinct mechanistic properties that could underly differential biological and physiological consequences of activation of Gi1 or Gi2 by GPCRs.",

    "abstract": "Lead toxicity is a major environmental issue and has been associated with various health problems such as cognitive and behavioral impairments, reproductive defects and cellular oxidative stress. The study investigated the potential of resveratrol in mitigating the effects of lead-induced toxicity in Drosophila melanogaster. Three (3) days old Harwich strain adult D. melanogaster were orally exposed to Pb (60 mg/L), Succimer (10 mg/kg), and Resveratrol (50, 100 and 150 mg/kg). Biological and biochemical parameters (ALP, AST, TB, CB, and electrolytes levels), kidney function test (Ur and Cr), oxidative stress marker (MDA), and antioxidants (SOD, and CAT) were evaluated. Resveratrol significantly increased egg-laying, eclosion rate, filial generation output, locomotor activity, and life span of D. melanogaster in a dose-dependent manner up to 150 mg/kg of diet. Most biochemical parameters investigated were significantly rescued in the lead-poisoned fruit flies (p < 0.05) when co-treated with resveratrol. The results suggest that resveratrol has a protective effect against lead toxicity in Drosophila melanogaster and could potentially be used as a therapeutic agent for lead poisoning in humans.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionPosttranslational modification of proteins by reversible acetylation regulates key biological processes. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) catalyze protein deacetylation and are frequently dysregulated in tumors. This has spurred the development of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi). Such epigenetic drugs modulate protein acetylation, eliminate tumor cells, and are approved for the treatment of blood cancers.\n\nObjectivesWe aimed to identify novel, nanomolar HDACi with increased potency over existing agents and selectivity for the cancer-relevant class I HDACs (HDAC1/-2/-3/-8). Moreover, we wanted to define how such drugs control the apoptosis-autophagy interplay. As test systems, we used human leukemic cells and embryonic kidney-derived cells.\n\nMethodsWe synthesized novel pyrimidine-hydroxamic acid HDACi (KH9/KH16/KH29) and performed in vitro activity assays and molecular modeling of their direct binding to HDACs. We analyzed how these HDACi affect leukemic cell fate, acetylation, and protein expression with flow cytometry and immunoblot. The publicly available DepMap database of CRISPR-Cas9 screenings was used to determine sensitivity factors across human leukemic cells.\n\nResultsNovel HDACi show nanomolar activity against class I HDACs. These agents are superior to the clinically used hydroxamic acid HDACi vorinostat. Within the KH-series of compounds, KH16 (yanostat) is the most effective inhibitor of HDAC3 (IC50 = 6 nM) and the most potent inducer of apoptosis (IC50 = 110 nM; p<0.0001) in leukemic cells. KH16 though spares embryonic kidney-derived cells. Global data analyses of knockout screenings verify that HDAC3 is a dependency factor in human blood cancer cells of different lineages, independent of mutations in the tumor suppressor p53. KH16 alters pro- and anti-apoptotic protein expression, stalls cell cycle progression, and induces a caspase-dependent processing of the autophagy proteins ULK1 and p62.\n\nConclusionThese data reveal that HDACs are required to stabilize autophagy proteins through a suppression of apoptosis in leukemic cells. HDAC3 appears as a valid anti-cancer target for pharmacological intervention.\n\nHighlightsO_LINovel HDACi with nanomolar activity against leukemic cells were synthesized.\nC_LIO_LIHDACi of the KH-series are superior to a clinical grade HDACi.\nC_LIO_LIHDACi of the KH-series modulate acetylation and phosphorylation of proteins.\nC_LIO_LIThe new HDACi KH16 regulates cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and autophagy.\nC_LIO_LIApoptosis acts upstream of autophagy in KH16-treated cells.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Sodium (Na+) current is responsible for the rapid depolarization of cardiac myocytes that triggers the cardiac action potential upstroke. Recent studies have illustrated the presence of multiple \"pools\" of Na+ channels with distinct biophysical properties and subcellular localization, including clustering of channels at the intercalated disk and along the lateral membrane. Computational studies predict that Na+ channel clusters at the intercalated disk can regulate cardiac conduction via modulation of the narrow intercellular cleft between electrically coupled myocytes. However, these studies have primarily focused on the redistribution of Na+ channels between intercalated disk and lateral membranes and not considered the distinct biophysical properties of the Na+ channel subpopulations. In this study, we simulate computational models of single cardiac cells and one-dimensional cardiac tissues to predict the functional consequence of distinct Na+ channel subpopulations. Single cell simulations predict that a subpopulation of Na+ channels with shifted steady-state activation and inactivation voltage-dependency promote an earlier action potential upstroke. In cardiac tissues that account for distinct subcellular spatial localization, simulations predict that \"shifted\" Na+ channels contribute to faster and more robust conduction, with regards to sensitivity to tissue structural changes (i.e., cleft width), gap junctional coupling, and rapid pacing rates. Simulations predict that the intercalated disk-localized shifted Na+ channels provide a disproportionally larger contribution to total Na+ charge, relative to lateral membrane-localized Na+ channels. Importantly, our work supports the hypothesis that Na+ channel redistribution may be a critical mechanism by which cells can rapidly respond to perturbations to support fast and robust conduction.\n\nSummarySodium channels are organized in multiple \"pools\" with distinct biophysical properties and subcellular localization, but the role of these subpopulations is not well-understood. Computational modeling predicts that intercalated disk-localized sodium channels with shifted steady-state activation and inactivation voltage-dependence promote faster cardiac conduction.",

    "abstract": "Adaptations to high latitude photoperiods have been under positive selection during the domestication of many short-day (SD) flowering crops. Photoperiod insensitivity (auto-flowering) in drug-type Cannabis sativa circumvents the need for SD flowering requirements making outdoor cultivation in high latitudes possible. However, the benefits of photoperiod insensitivity are counterbalanced by low cannabinoid contents and poor flower quality in auto-flowering genotypes. Despite recent legalization in some countries, a mechanistic understanding of photoperiod insensitivity in cannabis is still lacking. Herein, we identify a splice site mutation within PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 37 (CsPRR37) in auto-flowering cannabis that causes photoperiod insensitivity. Using a combination of GWAS, fine mapping, and gene expression analyses, our results strongly indicate CsPRR37 as the most likely candidate for causing photoperiod insensitivity. Research into the pervasiveness of this mutation and others effecting flowering time will help elucidate its domestication history and advance cannabis breeding towards a more sustainable outdoor cultivation system.",

    "abstract": "SnRK1 and SnRK3.11/SOS2 are key protein kinases in plant cellular energy and salt stress signaling, respectively. Using cellular assays, we confirm that the GRIK/SnAK (Geminivirus Rep-Interacting Kinase/SnRK1-Activating Kinase) proteins act as their main activating upstream kinases in Arabidopsis, catalyzing T-loop phosphorylation on the SnRK11 T175 and SOS2 T168 residues. Remarkably, SnRK11 phosphorylation on the neighbouring S176 residue competes with GRIK-mediated T175 phosphorylation to negatively regulate SnRK1 activity. Cellular assays and transgenic plants also revealed that the GRIK proteins, via N-terminal S-acylation, are predominantly localized at the tonoplast, where they interact with SnRK11 and SOS2. We optimized a leaf mesophyll protoplast-based Acyl PEG Exchange (APE) protocol to further explore GRIK protein S-acylation and tonoplast recruitment and identified the amino acid residues involved. GRIK1 tonoplast localization is likely mediated by initial membrane sampling via N-terminal domain hydrophobicity and local S-acylation, independently of a secretory pathway. Finally, grik1-1 grik2-1 double KO mutants complemented with a non-S-acylatable mutant GRIK1 protein exhibit increased salt sensitivity (reduced SOS2 activity) but hyperactive SnRK1 signaling, demonstrating the differential importance of GRIK subcellular localization for Arabidopsis salt and energy stress responses.",

    "abstract": "Cell wall properties can play a major role in determining photosynthetic carbon-uptake and water-use through impacts on mesophyll conductance (CO2 diffusion from substomatal cavities into photosynthetic mesophyll cells) and leaf hydraulic conductance (water movement from xylem, through leaf tissue to stomata). Consequently, modification of cell wall properties is proposed as a major path for improving photosynthesis and crop water-use efficiency. We tested this using two independent transgenic rice lines that overexpress the rice OsAT10 gene (a \"BAHD\" CoA acyltransferase) which altered cell wall hydroxycinnamic acid content (greater para-coumaric acid and lower ferulic acid). Plants were grown under high and low water-levels and traits related to leaf anatomy, cell wall composition, gas exchange and hydraulics, plant biomass, and canopy-level water-use were measured. Alteration of hydroxycinnamic acid content led to significant decreases in mesophyll cell wall thickness (-14%), and increased mesophyll conductance (+120%) and photosynthesis (+22%). However, concomitant increases in stomatal conductance negated increased photosynthesis, resulting in no change in intrinsic water-use efficiency (ratio of photosynthesis/stomatal conductance). The leaf hydraulic conductance was also unchanged; however, the transgenics showed small, but significant increase in above-ground biomass (+12.5%), and canopy-level water-use efficiency (+8.8%; ratio of above-ground biomass/ water-used) and performed better under low water-level. Our results demonstrate that changes in cell wall composition, specifically hydroxycinnamic acid content, can increase mesophyll conductance and photosynthesis in C3 cereal crops like rice. However, attempts to improve photosynthetic water-use efficiency will need to enhance mesophyll conductance and photosynthesis whilst maintaining or decreasing stomatal conductance.",

The causative mutation was identified as a G-to-A transition at the border of the eighth intron and ninth exon of the At5G61330 gene, resulting in a mis-spliced mRNA transcript. FAN is a homolog of the mammalian AATF/Che-1 protein consisting of conserved AATF/Che-1 and TRAUB domains in Arabidopsis. In the fan mutant, under normal conditions, we detected DNA damage and cell death response at the root tip, while hypersensitivity to the exogenously applied hydroxyurea (HU) compared to Col-0, suggesting that FAN plays a role in the DNA damage response (DDR). Furthermore, our results showed that FAN is involved in DDR pathway regulated by ATM/RAD53-RELATED (ATR).

Plants possess many CaM-like (CML) proteins, but their binding partners and functions are mostly unknown. Here, using Arabidopsis CML13 as  bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, we isolated putative targets from three, unrelated protein families, namely, IQD proteins, calmodulin-binding transcriptional activators (CAMTAs), and myosins, all of which possess tandem isoleucine-glutamine (IQ) structural domains. Using the split-luciferase complementation assay in planta and the yeast 2-hybrid system, CML13 and CML14 showed a preference for interaction with tandem over single IQ domains. Relative to CaM, CML13 and CML14 displayed weaker signals when tested with the non-IQ, CaM-binding domain of glutamate decarboxylase or the single IQ domains of CNGC20 (cyclic-nucleotide gated channel-20) or IQM1 (IQ motif protein1). We examined IQD14 as a representative tandem IQ-protein and found that only CaM, CML13, and CML14 interacted with IQD14 among 12 CaM/CMLs tested. CaM, CML13, and CML14 bound in vitro to IQD14 in the presence or absence of Ca2+. Binding affinities were in the nM range and were higher when two tandem IQ domains from IQD14 were present. Green fluorescent protein-tagged versions of CaM, CML13, and CML14 localized to both the cytosol and nucleus in plant cells but were partially relocalized to the microtubules when co-expressed with IQD14 tagged with mCherry.

    "abstract": "The greening of young seedling is light induced but vulnerable to photo-oxidative stress at the same time, due to the immature status of chloroplasts. Accumulation of anthocyanin is a protective response to high light, by absorbing excess energy and serving as antioxidant. In this work with Arabidopsis, we found that GARP family transcription factors GOLDEN2-LIKE 2 (GLK2), as a key regulator to chloroplast development, also plays an intensive role in regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis during seedling de-etiolation, especially under high light stress. We demonstrate that GLK2 positively regulates anthocyanin biosynthesis by directly activating the transcription of anthocyanin late biosynthetic genes (LBGs) as well as TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA 1 (TTG1) gene, which encodes a key component of the regulatory MYB-bHLH-WDR (MBW) complex (which also activates LBGs). Our data further show that GLK2 and MBW each could activate the expression of DFR gene (key LBG) independently, via distinct promoter regions. We therefore propose a multifaceted involvement of GLK2 in anthocyanin biosynthesis as an important protective measure for developing chloroplasts, against excessive light exposure during seedling photomorphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Grafting is widely used in horticulture, shortly after grafting, callus tissues appear at the graft interface and the vascular tissues of the scion and rootstock connect. The graft interface contains a complex mix of tissues, we hypothesized that each tissue have is own metabolic response to wounding/grafting and accumulate different metabolites at different rates. We made intact and wounded cuttings and grafts of grapevine, and then measured changes in bulk secondary metabolite concentration and used metabolite imaging to study tissue specific responses. We show that some metabolites rapidly accumulate in specific tissues after grafting, e.g. stilbenes accumulate in necrotic tissues surrounding mature xylem vessels and gradually oligomerize over time. We also observe that some metabolites accumulate in the newly formed callus tissue at the graft interface and identify genotype-specific responses. Here we reveal the spatiotemporal dynamics of metabolite changes occurring during graft union formation for the first time. The rapid accumulation of stilbenes in the tissues damaged during the grafting process could be a plant defence mechanism, as stilbenes have antioxidant and anti-fungal capacities. The increasing oligomerization of stilbenes often occurs in response to plant stresses (via unknown mechanisms), but it potentially increases antioxidant activity.\n\nBrief summarySecondary metabolites accumulate after wounding and grafting in plants yet we have limited knowledge of tissue specific accumulation patterns and temporal dynamics. We show that stilbenes accumulate specifically in necrotic tissues and oligomerize over the time, whereas other compounds accumulate in the newly formed callus tissues. This suggests that these compounds have different roles in wounding healing and grafting.",

    "abstract": "Iron is an essential nutrient for plant photosynthesis and development, but excess iron leads to stress. After absorption from the soil, plants store iron in roots and distribute it to shoots via long-distance transport. Vacuole serves as the iron storage organ in root cells, maintaining cellular iron homeostasis, and vacuolar iron transporter (VIT) family proteins have been identified as plant vacuolar iron transporters. However, the contribution of vacuolar iron transporters to the overall iron homeostasis of plants is not fully understood. Here, we show that MEMBRANE PROTEIN OF ER BODY 3 (MEB3), a VIT family member, is a vacuolar iron transporter involved in root-shoot iron distribution in Arabidopsis thaliana. Heterologous expression of Arabidopsis MEB3 in yeast restored the iron resistance phenotype of the vacuolar iron transporter deficient mutant ccc1, indicating that MEB3 regulates iron transport. In Arabidopsis, MEB3 was expressed in almost all tissues, albeit to higher levels in roots and seedlings, and the MEB3 protein localized to the tonoplast. At low iron concentration, meb3 knockout mutants accumulated less iron in shoots, suggesting that MEB3 promotes iron accumulation in shoots. Consistently, meb3 mutants exhibited reduced growth compared with the wild type upon transfer to iron-deficient medium. However, at high iron concentration, meb3 mutants accumulated more iron in shoots and less iron in roots than the wild type, indicating the impairment of proper iron distribution in meb3 mutants. These findings demonstrate that MEB3 is a vacuolar iron transporter involved in root-to-shoot iron distribution.",

    "abstract": "Finding the best knockout strategy for coupling biomass growth and production of a target metabolite using a metabolic model is a challenge in biotechnology. In this research, a three-step method named OptEnvelope is developed based on finding minimal active reactions for a target point in the feasible solution space using a mixed-integer linear programming formula. The method initially finds the reduced desirable solution space (envelope) in the product versus biomass plot by removing all inactive reactions. Then, with reinsertion of the deleted reactions, OptEnvelope attempts to reduce the number of knockouts so that the desirable envelope is preserved. Additionally, OptEnvelope searches for envelopes with higher minimum production rates or fewer knockouts by evaluating different target points within the desired solution space. It is possible to limit the maximal number of knockouts. The method was implemented on metabolic models of E. coli and S. cerevisiae to test the method benchmarking the capability of these industrial microbes for overproduction of acetate and glycerol under aerobic conditions and succinate and ethanol under anaerobic conditions. The results indicate that E. coli is more appropriate to produce acetate and succinate while S. cerevisiae is a better host for glycerol production. Gene deletions for some of the proposed reaction knockouts have been previously reported to increase the production of these metabolites in experiments. Both organisms are suitable for ethanol production, however, more knockouts for the adaptation of E. coli are required. OptEnvelope is available at https://github.com/lv-csbg/optEnvelope.",

Here we present SwitchSeeker, a comprehensive computational and experimental approach for systematic identification of functional RNA structural switches. We applied SwitchSeeker to the human transcriptome and identified 245 putative RNA switches. To validate our approach, we characterized a previously unknown RNA switch in the 3UTR of the RORC transcript. In vivo DMS-MaPseq, coupled with cryogenic electron microscopy, confirmed its existence as two alternative structural conformations. Furthermore, we used genome-scale CRISPR screens to identify trans factors that regulate gene expression through this RNA structural switch. We found that nonsense-mediated mRNA decay acts on this element in a conformation-specific manner. SwitchSeeker provides an unbiased, experimentally-driven method for discovering RNA structural switches that shape the eukaryotic gene expression landscape.",

    "abstract": "The pancreas plays a critical role in maintaining glucose homeostasis through the secretion of hormones from the islets of Langerhans. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) by the pancreatic {beta}-cell is the main mechanism for reducing elevated plasma glucose. Here we present a systematic modeling workflow for the development of kinetic pathway models using the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). Steps include retrieval of information from databases, curation of experimental and clinical data for model calibration and validation, integration of heterogeneous data including absolute and relative measurements, unit normalization, data normalization, and model annotation. An important factor was the reproducibility and exchangeability of the model, which allowed the use of various existing tools. The workflow was applied to construct the first consensus model of GSIS in the pancreatic {beta}-cell based on experimental and clinical data from 39 studies spanning 50 years of pancreatic, islet, and {beta}-cell research in humans, rats, mice, and cell lines. The model consists of detailed glycolysis and equations for insulin secretion coupled to cellular energy state (ATP/ADP ratio). Key findings of our work are that in GSIS there is a glucose-dependent increase in almost all intermediates of glycolysis. This increase in glycolytic metabolites is accompanied by an increase in energy metabolites, especially ATP and NADH. One of the few decreasing metabolites is ADP, which, in combination with the increase in ATP, results in a large increase in ATP/ADP ratios in the {beta}-cell with increasing glucose. Insulin secretion is dependent on ATP/ADP, resulting in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The observed glucose-dependent increase in glycolytic intermediates and the resulting change in ATP/ADP ratios and insulin secretion is a robust phenomenon observed across data sets, experimental systems and species. Model predictions of the glucose-dependent response of glycolytic intermediates and insulin secretion are in good agreement with experimental measurements. Our model predicts that factors affecting ATP consumption, ATP formation, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and ATP/ADP-dependent insulin secretion have a major effect on GSIS. In conclusion, we have developed and applied a systematic modeling workflow for pathway models that allowed us to gain insight into key mechanisms in GSIS in the pancreatic {beta}-cell.",

Here we assess the impact of aging on multiple proteome dimensions, which are reflective of function, across the replicative lifespan of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We quantified protein abundance, protein turnover, protein thermal stability, and protein phosphorylation in mother yeast cells and their derived progeny at different ages. We find progressive and cumulative proteomic alterations that are reflective of dysregulation of complex assemblies, mitochondrial remodeling, post-translational activation of the AMPK/Snf1 energy sensor in mother cells, and an overall shift from biosynthetic to energy-metabolic processes. Our multidimensional proteomic study systematically corroborates previous findings of asymmetric segregation and daughter cell rejuvenation, and extends these concepts to protein complexes, protein phosphorylation, and activation of signaling pathways. Lastly, profiling age-dependent proteome changes in a caloric restriction model of yeast provided mechanistic insights into longevity, revealing minimal remodeling of energy-metabolic pathways, improved mitochondrial maintenance, ameliorated protein biogenesis, and decreased stress responses. Taken together, our study provides thousands of age-dependent molecular events that can be used to gain a holistic understanding of mechanisms of aging.",

    "abstract": "Scarab beetles (Scarabaeidae) are a diverse and ecologically important group of angiosperm-associated insects. As conventionally understood, scarab beetles comprise two major lineages: dung beetles and the phytophagous Pleurosticti. However, previous phylogenetic analyses have not been able to convincingly answer the question whether or not the two lineages form a monophyletic group. Here we report our results from phylogenetic analyses of more than 4,000 genes mined from transcriptomes of more than 50 species of Scarabaeidae and other Scarabaeoidea. Our results provide convincing support for the monophyly of Scarabaeidae, confirming the debated sister group relationship of dung beetles and phytophagous pleurostict scarabs. Supermatrix-based maximum likelihood and multispecies coalescent phylogenetic analyses strongly imply the subfamily Melolonthinae as currently understood being paraphyletic. We consequently suggest various changes in the systematics of Melolonthinae: Sericinae Kirby, 1837 stat. rest. and sensu n. to include the tribes Sericini, Ablaberini and Diphucephalini, and Sericoidinae Erichson, 1847 stat. rest. and sensu n. to include the tribes Automoliini, Heteronychini, Liparetrini, Maechidiini, Scitalini, Sericoidini, and Phyllotocini. Both subfamilies appear to consistently form a monophyletic sister group to all remaining subfamilies so far included within pleurostict scarabs except Orphninae. Our results represent a major step towards understanding the diversification history of one of the largest angiosperm-associated radiations of beetles.",

    "abstract": "The growth of large-scale spatial gene expression data requires new computational tools to extract major trends in gene expression in their native spatial context. Here, we describe an unsupervised and interpretable computational framework to (1) pre-process 3D spatial gene expression datasets by imputation of missing voxels, (2) identify principal patterns (PPs) of 3D spatial gene expression profiles using the stability-driven non-negative matrix factorization (staNMF) technique, and (3) systematically compare these PPs to known anatomical regions and ontology. This framework, referred to as osNMF (ontology discovery via staNMF), identifies PPs that are derived purely from thousands of 3D spatial gene expression profiles in the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas. These 3D PPs present stable and spatially coherent regions of the mouse brain, potentially without human labor and bias. We demonstrate that osNMF PPs offer new brain patterns that are highly correlated with combinations of expert-annotated brain regions, while also identifying a unique ontology based purely on spatial gene expression data. Compared to principal component analysis (PCA) and other clustering algorithms, our PPs exhibit better spatial coherence, more accurately match expert labeling and are more stable across multiple bootstrapped simulations. We also used osNMF to define marker genes and build putative spatial gene interaction networks. Our findings highlight the capability of osNMF to rapidly generate new atlases from a large set of spatial gene expression data without supervision and uncover novel relationships between brain regions that were difficult to discern using conventional manual approaches.",

    "abstract": "The optimal life history and sex allocation of perennial hermaphrodites should depend on both their size and the relative costs and benefits of reproducing through male versus female functions. Theory predicts that insect-pollinated perennials should increase their allocation to female function with size, while the  mating environment hypothesis predicts that allocation to male function should track mating opportunities over the course of flowering. We test these two predictions by inferring male and female reproductive success in the protogynous perennial herb Pulsatilla alpina by tracking the patterns and dynamics of sex allocation over time for marked individuals over a range of sizes. We found that small individuals tend to produce only male flowers and that both small and larger individuals produced male flowers at the beginning of the flowering season when mating opportunities were high. By considering within-population variation in life history and phenology jointly rather than separately, and by considering both the tradeoff costs and benefits of allocation to male versus female functions, our results provide new insights into the evolution of both gender diphasy and andromonoecy in perennial plants that are constrained by a dichogamous flowering strategy.",

We developed an end-to-end transformer encoder architecture named Proformer to predict the expression values from DNA sequences. Proformer used a Macaron-like Transformer encoder architecture, where two half-step feed forward (FFN) layers were placed at the beginning and the end of each encoder block, and a separable 1D convolution layer was inserted after the first FFN layer and in front of the multi-head attention layer. The sliding k-mers from one-hot encoded sequences were mapped onto a continuous embedding, combined with the learned positional embedding and strand embedding (forward strand vs. reverse complemented strand) as the sequence input. Moreover, Proformer introduced multiple expression heads with mask filling to prevent the transformer models from collapsing when training on relatively small amount of data. We empirically determined that this design had significantly better performance than the conventional design such as using the global pooling layer as the output layer for the regression task. These analyses support the notion that Proformer provides a novel method of learning and enhances our understanding of how cis-regulatory sequences determine the expression values.",

However, patients harbour a population of quiescent leukemic stem cells (LSCs) which can emerge from quiescence to trigger relapse after therapy. The processes that allow such cells to re- grow remain unknown. Here, we examined the well characterised t(8;21) AML sub-type as a model to address this question. Using a novel t(8;21) patient-derived xenograft model, we show that t(8;21) LSCs aberrantly activate the VEGF and IL-5 signalling pathways.

Leveraging spatial molecular information to construct a phylogeographic map of tumor evolution can reveal individualized growth trajectories with diagnostic and therapeutic potential.

Copy number variation served to re-stratify microsatellite stable and unstable tumors into chromosomally unstable (CIN+) and hypermutated (HM) classes. Phylogeographical maps classified tumors by their evolutionary dynamics, and clonal regions were placed along a global pseudotemporal progression trajectory. Cell-state discovery from a single-cell cohort revealed recurring epithelial gene signatures and infiltrating immune states in spatial transcriptomics. Charting these states along progression pseudotime, we observed a transition to immune exclusion in CIN+ tumors as characterized by a novel gene expression signature comprised of DDR1, TGFBI, PAK4, and DPEP1. We demonstrated how these genes and their protein products are key regulators of extracellular matrix components, are associated with lower cytotoxic immune infiltration, and show prognostic value in external cohorts.

    "abstract": "Biophysical and biochemical attributes of the extracellular matrix are major determinants of cell fate in homeostasis and disease. Ocular hypertension and glaucoma are diseases where the trabecular meshwork tissue responsible for aqueous humor egress becomes stiffer accompanied by changes in its matrisome in a segmental manner with regions of high or low flow. Prior studies demonstrate these alterations in the matrix are dynamic in response to age and pressure changes. The underlying reason for segmentation or differential response to pressure and stiffening are unknown. This is largely due to a lack of appropriate models (in vitro or ex vivo) to study this phenomena. In this study, we characterize the biomechanical attributes, matrisome, and incidence of crosslinks in the matrix deposited by primary cells isolated from segmental flow regions and when treated with glucocorticosteroid. Data demonstrate that matrix deposited by cells from low flow regions are stiffer and exhibit a greater number of immature and mature crosslinks, and that these are exacerbated in the presence of steroid. We also show a differential response of high or low flow cells to steroid via changes observed in the matrix composition. We conclude that although a mechanistic basis for matrix stiffness was undetermined in this study, it is a viable tool to study cell-matrix interactions and further our understanding of trabecular meshwork pathobiology.",

Here we present a sorghum multi-reference back-cross nested association mapping (BCNAM) population composed of 3901 lines produced by crossing 24 diverse parents to three elite parents from West and Central Africa (WCA-BCNAM). The population was characterized in environments contrasting for photoperiod, rainfall, temperature, and soil fertility. To analyse this multi-parental and multi-environment design, we developed a new methodology for QTL detection and parental effect estimation. In addition, envirotyping data were mobilized to determine the influence of specific environmental covariables on the genetic effects, which allowed spatial projections of the QTL effects. We mobilized this strategy to analyse the genetic architecture of flowering time and plant height, which represent key adaptation mechanisms in environments like West Africa. Our results allowed a better characterisation of well-known genomic regions influencing flowering time concerning their response to photoperiod with Ma6 and Ma1 being photoperiod sensitive and candidate gene Elf3 being insensitive. We also accessed a better understanding of plant height genetic determinism with the combined effects of phenology dependent (Ma6) and independent (qHT7.1 and Dw3) genomic regions. Therefore, we argue that the WCA-BCNAM constitutes a key genetic resource to feed breeding programs in relevant elite parental lines and develop climate-smart varieties.",

    "abstract": "The GAIN domain is a hallmark of adhesion G-protein coupled receptors (aGPCRs) as this extracellular domain contains an integral agonistic sequence (Stachel) for activation via binding to the 7-transmembrane helical (7TM) domain of the receptor. Many aGPCRs are autoproteolytically cleaved at the GPCR proteolysis site (GPS) site within the GAIN domain formed HXS/T sequence motif. However, other aGPCR can be activated without GPS cleavage. We determined the crystal structure of the human ADGRB2/BAI2 hormone receptor (HormR) and GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domains and found that this aGPCR is resistant to autoproteolysis despite the presence of a canonical HLS sequence motif at the GPS. We used structural comparisons and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to identify structural determinants that are important for autocleavage beyond the canonical HXS/T motif. These studies characterized a conserved glycine residue and an edge-{pi} interaction of the histidine base of the GPS sequence with a phenylalanine residue that is highly conserved in cleavage-competent aGPCRs. The MD simulations showed that this interaction is important to position the imidazole group of the histidine for deprotonation of the serine or threonine nucleophile. Removal of this interaction reduced autoprote-olytic activity in the ADGRL1 receptor and restored cleavage competence of the ADGRB3 receptor in a R866H/L821F double mutant. Conservation analysis indicates that wild-type ADGRB2 and ADGRB3 are auto-cleavage-incompetent receptors.",

    "abstract": "Cas9 is a programmable nuclease that has furnished transformative technologies, including base editors and transcription modulators (e.g., CRISPRi/a), but several applications of these technologies, including therapeutics, mandatorily require precision control of their half-life. For example, such control can help avert any potential immunological and adverse events in clinical trials. Current genome editing technologies to control the half-life of Cas9 are slow, have lower activity, involve fusion of large response elements (> 230 amino acids), utilize expensive controllers with poor pharmacological attributes, and cannot be implemented in vivo on several CRISPR-based technologies. We report a general platform for half-life control using the molecular glue, pomalidomide, that binds to a ubiquitin ligase complex and a response-element bearing CRISPR-based technology, thereby causing the latters rapid ubiquitination and degradation. Using pomalidomide, we were able to control the half-life of large CRISPR-based technologies (e.g., base editors, CRISPRi) and small anti-CRISPRs that inhibit such technologies, allowing us to build the first examples of on-switch for base editors. The ability to switch on, fine-tune and switch-off CRISPR-based technologies with pomalidomide allowed complete control over their activity, specificity, and genome editing outcome. Importantly, the miniature size of the response element and favorable pharmacological attributes of the drug pomalidomide allowed control of activity of base editor in vivo using AAV as the delivery vehicle. These studies provide methods and reagents to precisely control the dosage and half-life of CRISPR-based technologies, propelling their therapeutic development.",

Mg2+ is generally known to stabilize RNA structures by neutralizing phosphates, but how it contributes to ligand binding and conformational transition is understudied. Here, extensive molecular dynamics simulations (totaling 120 s) identified over 10 inner-shell Mg2+ ions in the SAM/SAH riboswitch. Six of them line the two sides of a groove to widen it and thereby pre-organize the riboswitch for ligand entry. They also form outer-shell coordination with the ligands and stabilize an RNA-ligand hydrogen bond, which effectively diminish the selectivity between SAM and SAH. One Mg2+ ion unique to the apo form maintains the Shine-Dalgarno sequence in an autonomous mode and thereby facilitates its release for ribosome binding. Mg2+ thus plays vital roles in SAM/SAH riboswitch function.",

    "abstract": "Modulation of odorant receptors mRNA induced by prolonged odor exposure is highly correlated with ligand-receptor interactions in Drosophila as well as mammals of the Muridae family. If this response feature is conserved in other organisms, this presents a potentially potent initial screening tool when searching for novel receptor-ligand interactions in species with predominantly orphan olfactory receptors. We demonstrate that mRNA modulation in response to 1-octen-3-ol odor exposure occurs in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. To investigate gene expression patterns at a global level, we generated an odor-evoked transcriptome associated with 1-octen-3-ol odor exposure. Transcriptomic data revealed that ORs and OBPs were transcriptionally responsive whereas other chemosensory gene families showed little to no differential expression. Alongside chemosensory gene expression changes, transcriptomic analysis found that prolonged exposure to 1-octen-3-ol modulated xenobiotic response genes, primarily members of the cytochrome P450, insect cuticle proteins, and glucuronosyltransferases families. Together, these findings suggest that mRNA transcriptional modulation caused by prolonged odor exposure is pervasive across taxa and accompanied by the activation of xenobiotic responses. Furthermore, odor-evoked transcriptomics create a potential screening tool for filtering and identification of chemosensory and xenobiotic targets of interest.",

    "abstract": "In many brain areas, neuronal activity is associated with a variety of behavioral and environmental variables. In particular, neuronal responses in the zebrafish hindbrain relate to oculomotor and swimming variables, as well as sensory information. However, the precise functional organization of the neurons has been difficult to unravel since neuronal responses are heterogeneous. Here we used dimensionality reduction methods on neuronal population data to reveal the role of the hindbrain in visually-driven oculomotor behavior and swimming. We imaged neuronal activity in zebrafish expressing GCaMP6s in the nucleus of almost all neurons, while monitoring the behavioral response to gratings that rotated with different speeds. We then used reduced-rank regression, a method that condenses the sensory and motor variables into a smaller number of  features, to predict the fluorescence traces of all ROIs (regions of interest). Despite the potential complexity of the visuo-motor transformation, our analysis revealed that the bulk of population activity can be explained by only two features. Based on the contribution of these features to each ROIs activity, ROIs formed three clusters. One cluster was related to vergent movements and swimming, whereas the other two clusters related to leftward and rightward rotation. Voxels corresponding to these clusters were segregated anatomically, with leftward and rightward rotation clusters located selectively to the left and right hemispheres, respectively. Just as described in many cortical areas, our analysis revealed that single neuron complexity co-exists with a simpler population-level description, thereby providing insights into the organization of visuo-motor transformations in the hindbrain.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (AD), which is linked to reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation, and neurotoxicity. Emerging evidence suggests a role of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), a major source of antioxidant response elements in AD. The molecular mechanism of oxidative stress and ferroptosis in astrocytes in AD is not yet fully understood. Here, we aim to investigate the mechanism by which Nrf2 regulates the ferroptosis of astrocytes in AD. Postmortem frontal cortex tissues from patients with AD and nondemented controls and brain tissue from the 3xTg AD mouse model and wild-type mice (10 months old) were used. Immunofluorescence staining for Nrf2, the ROS marker NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), and GFAP was performed. We further induced Nrf2 deficiency in mouse astrocytes by using RNAi and assessed the changes in ROS, ferroptosis, lipid peroxidation, and mitochondrial dysfunction by using western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. We found decreased expression of Nrf2 and upregulated expression of NOX4 in the frontal cortex from patients with AD and in the cortex of 3xTg mice compared to control mice. We demonstrated that Nrf2 deficiency led to ferroptosis-dependent oxidative stress-induced ROS with downregulated heme oxygenase-1 and glutathione peroxidase 4 and upregulated cystine glutamate expression. Moreover, Nrf2 deficiency increased lipid peroxidation, DNA oxidation, and mitochondrial fragmentation in mouse astrocytes. In conclusion, these results suggest that Nrf2 promotes ferroptosis of astrocytes involving oxidative stress in AD.",

    "abstract": "Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is a chronic gastrointestinal condition with high morbidity. While modern medical therapies have revolutionized the care of UC, 10-25% of patients fail medications and still progress to surgery. Thus, developing new treatments is a core problem in UC. T-cells, especially Th17 cells, are strongly linked with UC and are major targets of medications in UC. Tissue-resident memory T-cells (TRM) are a distinct class of T-cells that are highly enriched in the intestine, closely aligned with the microbiota, and are implicated in the pathogenesis of UC. Unlike circulating T-cells, TRM are difficult to target because they do not recirculate. Thus, we focused on cytokines like IL-15 which act as a tissue danger signal and regulate T-cells in situ. We found that the IL15 axis is upregulated in UC and predicts treatment response. IL-15 was redundant for Th17 differentiation but could activate terminally differentiated Th17 cells to promote intestinal inflammation. Finally, in CD4+ TRM from patients with UC, IL-15 upregulated RORC, the master transcription factor for Th17 cells, via a Janus Kinase (JAK)1 pathway. Thus, IL-15 promotes terminally differentiated inflammatory Th17 cells in the intestine raising the possibility that IL-15 may be a target for UC treatments.",

However, little is known about viral genetic features and evolutionary patterns in these environments. Here, we examined the evolutionary ecology of viruses across active and extinct seep stages in the area of Haima cold seeps in the South China Sea. Diverse antiviral defense systems in 487 microbial genomes spanning 43 families inform the dynamics of host-virus interactions. Accordingly, a total of 338 viral operational taxonomic units are identified and linked to 36 bacterial and archaeal phyla. Cold seep viruses are predicted to harbor diverse adaptive strategies to persist in this environment, including counter-defense systems, reverse transcriptases, auxiliary metabolic genes, and alternative genetic code assignments. Extremely low nucleotide diversity is observed in cold seep viral populations, being influenced by factors including microbial host, sediment depth and cold seep stage. Most cold seep viral genes are under strong purifying selection with trajectories that differ depending on whether cold seeps are active or extinct. This work sheds light on the understanding of environmental adaptation mechanisms and evolutionary patterns of viruses in the sub-seafloor biosphere.",

However, the mechanisms by which AMPs act on intracellular targets are not well understood. Using machine learning-based sequence analysis, we have discovered that a significant number of AMPs have a strong tendency to form liquid-like condensates in the presence of nucleic acids, a process known as phase separation. We have demonstrated that this phase separation propensity is linked to the effectiveness of the AMPs in inhibiting transcription and translation in vitro, as well as their ability to compact nucleic acids and form clusters with bacterial nucleic acids in bacterial cells. We propose that the AMP-driven compaction of nucleic acids and modulation of their phase transitions constitute a previously unrecognised mechanism by which AMPs exert their antibacterial effects. These findings open up exciting possibilities for the development of antimicrobials that target nucleic acid phase transitions.",

    "abstract": "Jumping is a rapid locomotory mode widespread in terrestrial organisms. However, it is a rare specialization in ants. Forward jumping has been reported within four distantly related ant genera: Gigantiops, Harpegnathos, Myrmecia, and Odontomachus. The temporal engagement of legs/body parts during jump, however, varies across these genera. It is unknown what morphological adaptations underlie such behaviors, and whether jumping in ants is solely driven directly by muscle contraction or additionally relies on elastic recoil mechanism. We investigate the morphological adaptations for jumping behavior by comparing differences in the locomotory musculature between jumping and non-jumping relatives using x-ray micro- CT and 3D morphometrics. We found that the size-specific volumes of the trochanter depressor muscle (scm6) of the middle and hind legs are 3-5 times larger in jumping ants, and that one coxal remotor muscle (scm2) is reduced in volume in the middle and/or hind legs. Notably, the enlargement in the volume of other muscle groups is directly linked to the legs or body parts engaged during the jump. Furthermore, a direct comparison of the muscle architecture revealed two significant differences between in jumping versus non-jumping ants: First, the relative Physiological Cross-Sectional Area (PCSA) of the trochanter depressor muscles of all three legs were larger in jumping ants, except in the front legs of O. rixosus and M. nigrocincta; second, the relative muscle fiber length was shorter in jumping ants compared to non-jumping counterparts, except in the front legs of O. rixosus and M. nigrocincta. This suggests that the difference in relative muscle volume in jumping ants is largely invested in the area (PCSA), and not in fiber length. There was no clear difference in the pennation angle between jumping and non-jumping ants. However, the length of hind legs relative to body length was longer in jumping ants. Based on direct comparison of the observed vs. possible work and power output during jumps, we surmise that direct muscle contractions suffice to explain jumping performance, in two species, but elastic recoil is likely important in one. We suggest that increased investment in jumping-relevant musculature is a primary morphological adaptation that separates jumping from non-jumping ants. These results elucidate the common and idiosyncratic morphological changes underlying this rare adaptation in ants.",

This study builds models to investigate the evolution of the plasticity of flower longevity through group and individual selection under stochastic pollination environments. Generally, stronger plasticity evolves when female and male fitness accrual rates are higher and more volatile, and the evolution of plasticity is also strongly affected by daily maintenance cost of flowers relative to construction costs. Group selection only selects for plasticity in the female function (i.e., ovule fertilization) but not in the male function (i.e., pollen removal), and plasticity is optimal in maximizing fitness only when saved resources through plasticity greatly enhance individual fitness. Plasticity is more likely to evolve under individual selection, but under the same pollination environment, any combination of the plasticity in female and male functions that adds up to a certain overall strength of plasticity can be evolutionarily stable. Given the fact that plasticity in the male function is rare in hermaphroditic populations, the plasticity of flower longevity may evolve mainly through group selection instead of individual selection.",

Using population genetic models, this study investigates the effects of sprorophytic and gametophytic selfing on the evolution of a modifier of sex. Results show that although indirect selection due to segregation and selection against genome-wide deleterious mutations can favor sexual reproduction under gametophytic selfing, it greatly inhibits the evolution of both asexual and sexual reproduction under spropophytic selfing. Both sporophytic and gametophytic selfing also reduce the fitness of sexually reproduced offspring relative to asexually reproduced offspring, which can cause direct selection against sexual reproduction. Selfing also weakens selection against sex caused by the transmission disadvantage and mate limitation. However, under sporophytic selfing, indirect selection due to segregation is much stronger than other types of selection, but is comparable to other types of selection under gametophytic selection. The results offer novel insights on the evolution of diverse reproductive modes in plant populations, and suggest that the evolution of the rate of sexual reproduction may precede the evolution of selfing in angiosperms and gymnosperms.",

However, some conventional studies did not investigate whether deleterious off-target effects partially affect the phenotype. Herein, we present a novel phenotypic assessment of CRISPR-mediated gene editing: Deleterious and ANticipatable Guides Evaluated by RNA-sequencing (DANGER) analysis. Using RNA-seq data, this bioinformatics pipeline can elucidate genomic on/off-target sites on mRNA-transcribed regions related to expression changes and then quantify phenotypic risk at the gene ontology (GO) term level. We demonstrated the risk-averse on/off-target assessment in RNA-seq data from gene-edited samples of human cells and zebrafish brains. Our DANGER analysis successfully detected off-target sites, and it quantitatively evaluated the potential contribution of deleterious off-targets to the transcriptome phenotypes of the edited mutants. Notably, DANGER analysis harnessed de novo transcriptome assembly to perform risk-averse on/off-target assessments without a reference genome. Thus, our resources would help assess genome editing in non-model organisms, individual human genomes, and atypical genomes from diseases and viruses. In conclusion, DANGER analysis facilitates the safer design of genome editing in all organisms with a transcriptome.",

    "abstract": "Some bacteria survive in nutrient-poor environments and resist killing by antimicrobials by forming spores. The cortex layer of the peptidoglycan cell wall that surrounds mature spores contains a unique modification, muramic-{delta}-lactam, that is essential for spore germination and outgrowth. Two proteins, the amidase CwlD and the deacetylase PdaA, are required for muramic-{delta}-lactam synthesis in cells, but their combined ability to generate muramic-{delta}-lactam has not been directly demonstrated. Here we report an in vitro reconstitution of cortex peptidoglycan biosynthesis, and we show that CwlD and PdaA together are sufficient for muramic-{delta}-lactam formation. Our method enables characterization of the individual reaction steps, and we show for the first time that PdaA has transamidase activity, catalyzing both the deacetylation of N-acetylmuramic acid and cyclization of the product to form muramic-{delta}-lactam. This activity is unique among peptidoglycan deacetylases and is notable because it may involve the direct ligation of a carboxylic acid with a primary amine. Our reconstitution products are nearly identical to the cortex peptidoglycan found in spores, and we expect that they will be useful substrates for future studies of enzymes that act on the spore cortex.",

    "abstract": "Escherichia coli possess the 16S and 23S rRNA strands that have 36 chemical modification sites with 17 different structures. Direct RNA nanopore sequencing using a protein nanopore sensor and helicase brake, which is also a sensor, was applied to the rRNAs. Nanopore current levels, base calling profile, and helicase dwell times for the modifications relative to non-modified synthetic rRNA controls found signatures for nearly all modifications. Signatures for clustered modifications were determined by selective sequencing of writer knock-out E. coli and sequencing of synthetic RNAs utilizing some custom-synthesized nucleotide triphosphates for their preparation. The knowledge of each modifications signature, apart from 5-methylcytidine, was used to determine how metabolic and cold-shock stress impact rRNA modifications. Metabolic stress resulted in either no change or a decrease, and one site increased in modification occupancy, while cold-shock stress led to either no change or a decrease. In the 16S rRNA, there resides an m4Cm modification at site 1402 that decreased with both stressors. Using helicase dwell time, it was determined that the N4 methyl group is lost during both stressors, and the 2-OMe group remained. In the ribosome, this modification stabilizes binding to the mRNA codon at the P-site resulting in increased translational fidelity that is lost during stress. The E. coli genome has seven rRNA operons (rrn), and earlier studies aligned the nanopore reads to a single operon (rrnA). Here, the reads were aligned to the seven operons to identify operon-specific changes in the 11 pseudouridines. This study demonstrates that direct sequencing for >16 different RNA modifications in a strand is achievable.",

    "abstract": "Aging is the result of the accumulation of molecular damages that impair normal biochemical activities. We previously reported that aging-damaged amino acid sequence NGR (Asn-Gly-Arg) results in a  gain-of-function conformational switching to isoDGR (isoAsp-Gly-Arg) motif. This integrin-binding motif activates leukocytes to induce chronic inflammation, which are characteristic features of age-linked cardiovascular disorders. We now report that anti-isoDGR immunotherapy doubles lifespan in mouse model of chronic inflammation. We observed extensive accumulation of isoDGR and inflammatory cytokine expression in multiple tissues from Pcmt1-KO and old WT animals, which could also be induced via injection of isoDGR-modified plasma proteins or synthetic peptides into young WT animals. However, weekly injection of anti-isoDGR mAb (1mg/kg) was sufficient to significantly reduce isoDGR-modified proteins and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, improve behaviour and coordination, and double the average lifespan of Pcmt1-KO mice. Mechanistically, isoDGR-mAb mediated the immune clearance of damaged isoDGR-proteins by antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis. These results indicate that immunotherapy targeting aging-damaged proteins may represent effective interventions for a range of age-linked degenerative disorders.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=105 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/532237v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (12K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@81610borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a22aaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@169fe50org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b73d11_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Anti-isoDGR immunotherapy induces immune clearance of aging damaged isoDGR-proteins to reduce chronic inflammation, improve behaviour and coordination, and double lifespan in PCMT-/- mice.\n\nC_FIG",

A quantitative understanding of these processes requires both detections of oligomeric organization of IMPs and lipids directly from intact membranes and determination of key membrane components/properties that regulate them. Addressing this, we have developed a platform that enables native mass spectrometry (nMS) analysis of IMP-lipid complexes directly from intact and customizable lipid membranes. Both the lipid composition and membrane properties (such as curvature, tension, fluidity) of these bilayers can be precisely customized to a target membrane. Subsequent direct nMS analysis of these intact proteo-lipid vesicles can yield the oligomeric states of the embedded IMPs, identify bound lipids, and determine the membrane properties that can regulate the observed IMP-lipid organization. Applying this, we show how lipid binding regulates neurotransmitter release and how membrane composition regulates the functional oligomeric state of a transporter.",

    "abstract": "Missense mutations in the DNA binding domain of p53 are observed frequently in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC). Recent studies have revealed the potentially oncogenic transcriptional networks regulated by mutant p53 proteins. However, majority of these studies have focused on common  hotspot p53 mutations while rarer mutations are poorly characterized. We had previously identified SMARCD1 as an oncogenic transcriptional target of rare  non-hotspot p53 mutants detected from squamous cell carcinoma of the oral tongue (SCCOT). We now report the characterization of  non-hotspot p53 mutations from ESCC. In-vitro tumorigenic assays performed following ectopic-expression of  non-hotspot mutant p53 proteins caused enhancement of oncogenic properties in squamous carcinoma cell lines. Genome-wide transcript profiling of ESCC tumor samples stratified for p53 status, revealed several genes exhibiting elevated transcript levels in tumors harbouring mutant p53. Of these, ARF6, C1QBP and TRIM23 were studied further due to their previously reported pro-oncogenic roles. Reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) performed on RNA isolated from ESCC tumor samples revealed significant correlation of TP53 transcript levels with those of the three target genes. Ectopic expression of wild type and several mutant p53 forms followed by RT-qPCR, Chromatin affinity-purification and Promoter-luciferase assays indicated the exclusive recruitment of p53 mutants - P190T and P278L, to the target genes leading to activation of expression. Several functional assays following knockdown of the target genes revealed a significant suppression of tumorigenicity in squamous carcinoma cell lines. Rescue experiments confirmed the specificity of the knockdown. The tumorigenic effect of the genes was confirmed in nude mice xenograft assays. This study has therefore identified novel oncogenic targets of rare  non-hotspot mutant p53 proteins relevant for ESCC besides validating the functional heterogeneity of the spectrum of tumor specific p53 mutations.",

Here we used genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), and multimodal mass spectrometry-based metabolomics to study the impact of common genetic drivers of CRC on the metabolic landscape of the intestine. We show that unsupervised metabolic profiling can stratify intestinal tissues according to underlying genetic alterations, and use mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) to identify tumour, stromal and normal adjacent tissues. By identifying ions that drive variation between normal and transformed tissues, we found dysregulation of the methionine cycle to be a hallmark of APC-mutant CRC, and propose one of its enzymes, i.e. adenosylhomocysteinase (AHCY), as a new therapeutic target. Collectively, we show that the profound genotype-dependent alterations in both lipid and small molecule metabolism in CRC may be exploited for tissue classification with no need for ion identification, and we applied further data analysis to expose a novel metabolic vulnerability of CRC.",

Escherichia coli are a promising constituent of ELMs because they are very tractable to genetic engineering, produce heterologous proteins readily, and grow exponentially. However, seasonal variation in ambient temperature presents a challenge in deploying ELMs outside of a laboratory environment, because E. coli growth rate is impaired both below and above 37{degrees}C. Here, we develop a genetically-encoded mechanism for autonomous temperature homeostasis in ELMs containing E. coli by engineering circuits that control the expression of a light-absorptive chromophore in response to changes in temperature. We demonstrate that below 36{degrees}C, our engineered E. coli increase in pigmentation, causing an increase in sample temperature and growth rate above non-pigmented counterparts in a model planar ELM. On the other hand, above 36{degrees}C, they decrease in pigmentation, protecting their growth compared to bacteria with temperature-independent high pigmentation. Integrating our temperature homeostasis circuit into an ELM has the potential to improve living material performance by optimizing growth and protein production in the face of seasonal temperature changes.",

It is hypothesized that cnidarian neurotoxins led to the evolution of diverse ion channel proteins in cnidarians. I tested this hypothesis by investigating several evolutionary factors of both cnidarian neurotoxins and their target ion channels. I examined homologs of 250 cnidarian toxins, 75 ion channel genes, and 70 housekeeping genes from 37 transcriptomes/genomes of cnidarian species. Analysis on the presence or absence of genes by species, selection analysis, and evolutionary rate analysis were performed on the homologs of neurotoxin and ion channel proteins. I found evidence of positive selection, correlation between the number of homologous gene families, and difference in the evolutionary rates among the gene families. I have shown for the first time that neurotoxins may have coevolved with the ion channels in cnidarians. This is consistent with an evolutionary arms race between ion channels and neurotoxins leading to extensive diversity of ion channel genes found in cnidarians.",

    "abstract": "Polygenic scores have become an important tool in human genetics, enabling the prediction of individuals phenotypes from their genotypes. Understanding how the pattern of differences in polygenic score predictions across individuals intersects with variation in ancestry can provide insights into the evolutionary forces acting on the trait in question, and is important for under-standing health disparities. However, because most polygenic scores are computed using effect estimates from population samples, they are susceptible to confounding by both genetic and environmental effects that are correlated with ancestry. The extent to which this confounding drives patterns in the distribution of polygenic scores depends on patterns of population structure in both the original estimation panel and in the prediction/test panel. Here, we use theory from population and statistical genetics, together with simulations, to study the procedure of testing for an association between polygenic scores and axes of ancestry variation in the presence of confounding. We use a general model of genetic relatedness to describe how confounding in the estimation panel biases the distribution of polygenic scores in a way that depends on the degree of overlap in population structure between panels. We then show how this confounding can bias tests for associations between polygenic scores and important axes of ancestry variation in the test panel. Finally, we use the understanding gained from this analysis to develop a method that uses patterns of genetic similarity between the two panels to guard against these biases, and show that this method can provide better protection against confounding than the standard PCA-based approach.\n\nAuthor SummaryComplex traits are influenced by both genetics and the environment. Human geneticists increasingly use polygenic scores, calculated as the weighted sum of trait-associated alleles, to predict genetic effects on a phenotype. Differences in polygenic scores across groups would therefore seem to indicate differences in the genetic basis of the trait, which are of interest to researchers across disciplines. However, because polygenic scores are usually computed using effect sizes estimated using population samples, they are susceptible to confounding due to both the genetic background and the environment. Here, we use theory from population and statistical genetics, together with simulations, to study how environmental and background genetic effects can confound tests for association between polygenic scores and axes of ancestry variation. We then develop a simple method to protect these tests from confounding and show that our approach succeeds in situations that are difficult to protect with standard methods. Our work helps clarify how bias in the distribution of polygenic scores is produced and provides a tool to researchers wishing to protect their analyses from confounding.",

    "abstract": "Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is an important mechanism enabling the dynamic compartmentalisation of macromolecules, including complex polymers such as proteins and nucleic acids, and occurs as a function of the physicochemical environment. In the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, LLPS by the protein EARLY FLOWERING3 (ELF3) occurs in a temperature sensitive manner and controls thermoresponsive growth. ELF3 contains a largely unstructured prion-like domain (PrLD) that acts as a driver of LLPS in vivo and in vitro. The PrLD contains a poly-glutamine (polyQ) tract, whose length varies across natural Arabidopsis accessions. Here, we use a combination of biochemical, biophysical and structural techniques to investigate the dilute and condensed phases of the ELF3 PrLD with varying polyQ lengths. We demonstrate that the dilute phase of the ELF3 PrLD forms a monodisperse higher order oligomer that does not depend on the presence of the polyQ sequence. This species undergoes LLPS in a pH and temperature-sensitive manner and the polyQ region of the protein tunes the initial stages of phase separation. The liquid phase rapidly undergoes aging and forms a hydrogel as shown by fluorescence and atomic force microscopies. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the hydrogel assumes a semi-ordered structure as determined by small angle X-ray scattering, electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. These experiments demonstrate a rich structural landscape for a PrLD protein and provide a framework to describe the structural and biophysical properties of biomolecular condensates.",

    "abstract": "Falls are a problem, especially for older adults. Placing our feet accurately relative to the center-of-mass helps us to prevent falling during gait. The degree of foot placement control with respect to the center-of mass kinematic state is decreased in older as compared to young adults. Here, we attempted to train foot placement control in healthy older adults. Ten older adults trained by walking on shoes with a narrow ridge underneath (LesSchuh), restricting mediolateral center-of-pressure shifts. As a training effect, we expected improved foot placement control during normal walking. A training session consisted of a normal walking condition, followed by a training condition on LesSchuh and finally an after-effect condition. Participants performed six of such training sessions, spread across three weeks. As a control, before the first training session, we included two similar sessions, but on normal shoes only. We evaluated whether a training effect was observed across sessions and weeks in a repeated-measures design. Whilst walking with LesSchuh, the magnitude of foot placement error reduced half-a-millimeter between sessions within a week (cohens d=0.394). As a training effect in normal walking, the magnitude of foot placement errors was significantly lower compared to the control week, by one millimeter in weeks 2 (cohens d=0.686) and 3 (cohens d=0.780) and by two millimeters in week 4 (cohens d=0.875). Local dynamic stability of normal walking also improved significantly. More precise foot placement may thus have led to improved stability. It remains to be determined whether the training effects were the result of walking on LesSchuh or from repeated treadmill walking itself. Moreover, enhancement of mechanisms beyond the scope of our outcome measures may have improved stability. At the retention test, gait stability returned to similar levels as in the control week. Yet, a reduction in foot placement error persisted.",

    "abstract": "Metastasis consists of sequential steps initiated by cancer cells invading from the primary tumor site into neighboring tissues, followed by entry into the circulatory system and completed by extravasation and growth in distal organs where secondary tumors are formed. Circulating tumor cells, thus, encounter and adapt to multiple environmental changes during their transition from the primary to the secondary tumor sites. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a developmental program that consists of loss of epithelial features concomitant with acquisition of mesenchymal features. Activation of EMT in cancer facilitates acquisition of aggressive traits and cancer invasion. EMT plasticity (EMP), the dynamic transition between multiple hybrid states in which cancer cells display both epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes, confers survival advantages for cancer cells in the constantly changing environment. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating intermediate phenotypic states along the E-M spectrum is critical. Core EMT transcription factors (EMT-TFs), ZEB, SNAI and TWIST families, play an important role in EMT and its plasticity. In the present study we characterize FLASH as a regulator of EMP and multiple EMT-TFs. We demonstrate that loss of FLASH gives rise to a hybrid E/M phenotype with high epithelial scores even in the presence of TGF{beta}, as determined by computational methods using expression of predetermined sets of epithelial and mesenchymal genes. We demonstrate that FLASH is regulating expression of multiple cell junction proteins with an established role in cancer progression and that its role in EMT is independent of its histone biogenesis role. Further, we show that FLASH expression in cancer lines is inversely correlated with the epithelial score, consistent with its function as a repressor of the epithelial phenotype. Nonetheless, activation of a distinct set of mesenchymal markers concomitant with epithelial markers reveals the complex role of FLASH in EMT and indicates that intermediate E/M states could arise from opposing control by FLASH on different families of EMT-TFs.",

    "abstract": "An efficient and durable multi-targeted therapeutic drug against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has recently been a growing concern for tackling the chemoresistance of approved anti-HCC drugs. Recent studies indicated that methyltransferase-like (METTL) proteins including METTL1, METTL3, METTL6, METTL16, and METTL18, have overexpressed and associated with the progression of HCC malignancy, and making them excellent biomarkers. Here, we present a series of bioinformatics study including novel compound repurposing approach, molecular docking, pharmacophore modeling, and molecular dynamic simulation, which revealed two first-in-class highly potent catalytic multi-target inhibitors (ZINC70666503 and ZINC13000658 with 87% and 82% drug scores, respectively) of methyltransferase-like proteins. Comparatively, these two inhibitors showed a notable binding affinity against studied METTL proteins. Furthermore, ADME and toxicity analysis suggested that these two commercially available compounds have good drug-likeliness properties with no potent toxic effects. Of note, the molecular dynamics study supported their conformational stability and high selectivity at the pocket of proteins adenosine moiety of S-Adenosyl Methionine. However, this comprehensive analysis needs in vivo validation to facilitate multi-targeting therapeutic development against hepatocellular carcinoma.",

    "abstract": "Fluctuations in light intensity require immediate metabolic adjustment which includes reprogramming of both plastidial and nuclear gene expression, but the signaling pathways behind such responses are not fully understood. Here we report the identification of an early high-light responsive pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana that depends on PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE 1 (PHR1) and PHR1-LIKE 1 (PHL1) transcription factors involved in low phosphate (Pi) signaling. High-light treatment rapidly induced the accumulation of PHR1-responsive transcripts in wildtype plants grown under nutrient-sufficient conditions, but not in phr1 phl1 double knockout plants. Differences in starch accumulation and ATP levels were detected between wildtype and phr1 phl1 mutants subjected to high light, suggesting a link between Pi signaling, carbohydrate partitioning, and energy status during stress. In line with a function of PHR1/PHL1 upon triose phosphate accumulation, we observed that blocking starch biosynthesis in the phr1 phl1 double mutant, by introducing the agd1-1 allele, causes a severe growth defect. Phenotypes of the adg1 phr1 phl1 triple mutant such as high-light sensitivity and growth restriction in the absence of exogenously supplied sucrose resemble the previously described double mutant adg1 tpt-2, lacking a functional copy of the TRIOSE PHOSPHATE/PHOSPHATE TRANSLOCATOR (TPT), and we show that Pi responses are disturbed in adg1 tpt-2. We propose that Pi sequestration by photosynthesis and import of Pi into the chloroplast transiently depletes cytosolic Pi reserves upon sudden increases in light intensity. The low-Pi sensing machinery in the nucleus consequently implements early high-light transcriptional responses, qualifying Pi as a new operational retrograde signal.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWNeural activity tends to reside on manifolds whose dimension is much lower than the dimension of the whole neural state space. Experiments using brain-computer interfaces with microelectrode arrays implanted in the motor cortex of nonhuman primates tested the hypothesis that external perturbations should produce different adaptation strategies depending on how \"aligned\" the perturbation is with respect to a pre-existing intrinsic manifold. On the one hand, perturbations within the manifold (WM) evoked fast reassociations of existing patterns for rapid adaptation. On the other hand, perturbations outside the manifold (OM) triggered the slow emergence of new neural patterns underlying a much slower--and, without adequate training protocols, inconsistent or virtually impossible--adaptation. This suggests that the time scale and the overall difficulty of the brain to adapt depend fundamentally on the structure of neural activity. Here, we used a simplified static Gaussian model to show that gradient-descent learning could explain the differences between adaptation to WM and OM perturbations. For small learning rates, we found that the adaptation speeds were different but the model eventually adapted to both perturbations. Moreover, sufficiently large learning rates could entirely prohibit adaptation to OM perturbations while preserving adaptation to WM perturbations, in agreement with experiments. Adopting an incremental training protocol, as has been done in experiments, permitted a swift recovery of a full adaptation in the cases where OM perturbations were previously impossible to relearn. Finally, we also found that gradient descent was compatible with the reassociation mechanism on short adaptation time scales. Since gradient descent has many biologically plausible variants, our findings thus establish gradient-based learning as a plausible mechanism for adaptation under network-level constraints, with a central role for the learning rate.",

We use these ocular following eye movements to study motion integration behavior in the marmosets. We characterize ocular following responses in the marmosets using different moving stimuli such as dot patterns, gratings, and plaids. The marmosets can accurately track motion along different directions and exhibit spatial frequency and speed sensitivity that closely matches the sensitivity reported in neurons from their motion selective area MT. Marmosets are also able to track the integrated motion of plaids, with tracking direction consistent with intersection of constraints model of motion integration. Marmoset ocular following responses are similar to responses in macaques and humans with certain species-specific differences in peak sensitivities. Such motion sensitive eye movement behavior in combination with direct access to cortical circuitry makes the marmoset model well suited to study the neural basis of motion integration.\n\nSignificance statementOcular following is a reflexive eye tracking behavior in response to large visual field motion. It reflects the properties of underlying motion sensing circuits. One of the primary motion sensing areas in primates is area MT. In the primate species of marmosets, this and other cortical areas are easily accessible due to their lissencephalic brain. We demonstrate ocular following behavior in the marmosets for simple and complex motion trajectories and describe its characteristics. We then use ocular following to distinguish between different motion integration models. Our results show the utility of ocular following to study the neural basis for motion sensing in marmosets.",

    "abstract": "Sparse feature tables, in which many features are present in very few samples, are common in big biological data (e.g., metagenomics, transcriptomics). Ignoring the problem of zero-inflation can result in biased statistical estimates and decrease power in downstream analyses. Zeros are also a particular issue for compositional data analysis using log-ratios since the log of zero is undefined. Researchers typically deal with zero-inflated data by removing low frequency features, but the thresholds for removal differ markedly between studies with little or no justification. Here, we present CurvCut, a data-driven mathematical approach to zero-inflated feature removal based on curvature analysis of a \"ball rolling down a hill\", where the hill is a histogram of feature distribution. These histograms typically contain a point of regime change, a discontinuity with a sharp change in the characteristics of the distribution, that can be used as a cutoff point for low frequency feature removal that considers the data-specific nature of the feature distribution. Our results show that CurvCut works well across a variety of biological data types, including ones with both right- and left-skewed feature distributions, and rapidly generates clear visual results allowing researchers to select data-appropriate cutoffs for feature removal.",

The Two One-Sided Tests (TOST) procedure, consisting in testing whether the target parameter is respectively significantly greater and lower than some pre-defined lower and upper equivalence limits, is typically used in this context, usually by checking whether the confidence interval for the target parameter lies within these limits. This intuitive and visual procedure is however known to be conservative, especially in the case of highly variable drugs, where it shows a rapid power loss, often reaching zero, hence making it impossible to conclude for equivalence when it is actually true. Here, we propose a finite sample correction of the TOST procedure, the -TOST, which consists in a correction of the significance level of the TOST allowing to guarantee a test size (or type-I error rate) of . This new procedure essentially corresponds to a finite sample and variability correction of the TOST procedure. We show that this procedure is uniformly more powerful than the TOST, easy to compute, and that its operating characteristics outperform the ones of its competitors.

We studied whether these candidate effectors can play a role in plant immune suppression. Effector G4 was the most robust suppressor of the flg22-induced ROS response when transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana. In addition, G4 was able to supress ROS in Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) and Capsicum annuum (pepper). Fused to a fluorescence tag, G4 localized in the cytoplasm in N. benthamiana. A yeast two-hybrid screen combined with a luciferase bimolecular complementation and co-localization assays resulted in the identification of two target proteins in tomato: REF-like stress related protein 1 (RSP1) and meloidogyne-induced giant cell protein DB141 (MIPDB141). Silencing of MIPDB141 in tomato, using virus-induced gene silencing, reduced whitefly fecundity up to 40% demonstrating that the protein is involved in susceptibility to B. tabaci.

    "abstract": "Evolution of flowering time in plant populations is often ascribed to temporal distribution shifts of pollinator abundance. This study proposes another selective force on flowering time through the asynchrony of pollen dispersal, which provides a baseline model for the evolution of flowering time under constant pollination rates. Quantitative genetic models predict that the mean flowering time is likely to evolve earlier under a low pollen removal rate and a high pollen deposition rate, and when the fertilization ability of removed pollen declines slowly. The asynchrony of pollen dispersal also selects for evolutionarily stable variation in flowering time, which is larger under an either very low or high pollen removal rate, a higher pollen deposition rate, and a quicker decline of the fertilization ability of removed pollen. Moreover, the model predicts a positive correlation between flowering time and flower longevity under constant pollination rates, suggesting that a negative correlation observed in nature is mainly due to temporally declining pollination rates at the late stage of flowering periods. This study indicates that the evolution of flowering time under climate changes can be due to changes in both the level and temporal distribution of pollination abundance, which may have opposing effects.",

    "abstract": "Chromosome loss results in halving the dose of multiple genes. We reasoned that yeast monosomic strains would constitute a relatively simple model suited to address the complex question of how extant diploid organisms can stay relatively fit despite harboring numerous function-canceling (mostly heterozygous) mutations. We started by re-examining diploid yeast strains with a single heterozygous gene deletion and ascertained that many of them produced small but measurable growth defects. Mapped to individual chromosomes, they often combined into burdens sufficient to turn the growth rate negative, that is, inflict lethality. However, the subsequently derived monosomics did experience such loads yet continued to proliferate as if much (often most) of the harm introduced by single mutations disappeared. This constitutes an outstanding example of positive epistasis for fitness. We then sought its functional explanation by analyzing transcriptomes. There was no evidence for widespread gene-dose compensation or cellular stress response. Alterations were abundant but not parallel. A notable exception was the general upregulation of genes coding for ribosomal proteins and the concomitant downregulation of those coding for the proteasome. It indicates that the (irreparably) distorted stoichiometry of ribosomal proteins was the most common and critical impediment to growth and eclipsed the impact of other metabolic insufficiencies. In general terms, the modular structure of the cell leads to effective fragmentation of the total burden of mutations. Those located outside the module(s) currently defining fitness lose at least some of their relevance which produces the epiphenomenon of positive epistasis between individually negative effects.",
