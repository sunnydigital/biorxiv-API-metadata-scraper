    "abstract": "Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) are a preferred vector system in clinical gene transfer. A fundamental challenge to formulate and deliver rAAVs as stable and efficacious vaccines is to elucidate interrelationships between the vectors physicochemical properties and biological potency. To this end, we evaluated an rAAV-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate which encodes the Spike antigen (AC3) and is produced by an industrially-compatible process. First, state-of-the-art analytical techniques were employed to determine key structural attributes of AC3 including primary and higher-order structures, particle size, empty/full capsid ratios, aggregates and multi-step thermal degradation pathway analysis. Next, several quantitative potency measures for AC3 were implemented and data were correlated with the physicochemical analyses on thermal-stressed and control samples. Results demonstrate links between decreasing AC3 physical stability profiles, in vitro transduction efficiency in a cell-based assay, and importantly, in vivo immunogenicity in a mouse model. These findings are discussed in the general context of future development of rAAV-based vaccines candidates as well as specifically for the rAAV vaccine application under study.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated the potential for monoclonal antibody therapeutics as prophylactic and therapeutic agents against pandemic viruses. No such therapeutics currently exist for other human coronaviruses. NL63 is a human alphacoronavirus that typically causes the common cold and uses the same receptor, ACE2, as the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 pandemic viruses. In a cohort of healthy adults, we characterised humoral responses against the NL63 spike protein. While NL63 spike and receptor binding domain-specific binding antibodies and neutralisation activity could be detected in plasma of all subjects, memory B cells against NL63 spike were variable and relatively low in frequency compared to that against SARS-CoV-2 spike. From these donors, we isolated a panel of antibodies against NL63 spike and characterised their neutralising potential. We identified potent neutralising antibodies that recognised the receptor binding domain (RBD) and other non-RBD epitopes within spike.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has developed into a global health emergency. In addition to causing respiratory symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC) is the main cause of death in patients with severe COVID-19. In this study, we performed single-cell sequencing analysis of the right ventricular free wall tissue from healthy donors, patients who died in the hypercoagulable phase of CAC, and patients in the fibrinolytic phase of CAC. Among these, we collected 61,187 cells, which were enriched in 24 immune cell subsets and 13 cardiac-resident cell subsets. We found that in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, CD9highCCR2highmonocyte-derived mo promoted hyperactivation of the immune system and initiated the extrinsic coagulation pathway by activating CXCR-GNB/G-PI3K-AKT. This sequence of events is the main process contributing the development of coagulation disorders subsequent to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the characteristic coagulation disorder caused by SARS-CoV-2, excessive immune activation is accompanied by an increase in cellular iron content, which in turn promotes oxidative stress and intensifies intercellular competition. This induces cells to alter their metabolic environment, resulting in an increase in sugar uptake, such as that via the glycosaminoglycan synthesis pathway, in CAC coagulation disorders. In addition, high levels of reactive oxygen species generated in response elevated iron levels promote the activation of unsaturated fatty acid metabolic pathways in endothelial cell subgroups, including vascular endothelial cells. This in turn promotes the excessive production of the toxic peroxidation by-product malondialdehyde, which exacerbates both the damage caused to endothelial cells and coagulation disorders.",

    "abstract": "The Coronaviridae family hosts various coronaviruses responsible for many diseases, from the common cold, severe lung infections to pneumonia. SARS-CoV-2 was discovered to be the etiologic agent of the Coronavirus pandemic, and numerous basic and applied laboratory techniques were utilized in virus culture and examination of the disease. Understanding the replication kinetics and characterizing the virus effect on different cell lines is crucial for developing in vitro studies. With the emergence of multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2, a comparison between their infectivity and replication in common cell lines will give us a clear understanding of the characteristic differences in pathogenicity. In this study, we compared the cytopathic effect (CPE) and replication of Wild Type (WT), Omicron (B.1.1.529), and Delta (B.1.617.2) variants on 5 different cell lines; VeroE6, VeroE6 expressing high endogenous ACE2, VeroE6 highly expressing human ACE2 (VeroE6/ACE2) and TMPRSS2 (VeroE6/hACE2/ TMPRSS2), Calu3 cells highly expressing human ACE2 and A549 cells. All 3 VeroE6 cell lines were susceptible to WT strain, where CPE and replication were observed. Along with being susceptible to Wild type, VeroE6/hACE2/TMPRSS2 cells were susceptible to both omicron and delta strains, whereas VeroE6/ACE2 cells were only susceptible to omicron in a dose-dependent manner. No CPE was observed in both human lung cell lines, A549 and Calu3/hACE2, but Wild type and omicron replication was observed. As SAR-CoV-2 continues to evolve, this data will benefit researchers in experimental planning, viral pathogenicity analysis, and providing a baseline for testing future variants.",

Here, we solved a 2.16 [A] crystal structure of E12. We also docked the D1 subunit c-terminal domain (D1CTD) of vaccinia virus (VACV) with E12 to analyze the critical residues of interface between them. These residues are used for drug screening.

    "abstract": "The global pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a significant threat to public health. Besides humans, SARS-CoV-2 can infect several animal species. Highly sensitive and specific diagnostic reagents and assays are urgently needed for rapid detection and implementation of strategies for prevention and control of the infection in animals. In this study, we initially developed a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein. To detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a broad spectrum of animal species, a mAb-based bELISA was developed. Test validation using a set of animal serum samples with known infection status obtained an optimal percentage of inhibition (PI) cut-off value of 17.6% with diagnostic sensitivity of 97.8% and diagnostic specificity of 98.9%. The assay demonstrates high repeatability as determined by a low coefficient of variation (7.23%, 6.95%, and 5.15%) between-runs, within-run, and within-plate, respectively. Testing of samples collected over time from experimentally infected cats showed that the bELISA was able to detect seroconversion as early as 7 days post-infection. Subsequently, the bELISA was applied for testing pet animals with COVID-19-like symptoms and specific antibody responses were detected in two dogs. The panel of mAbs generated in this study provides a valuable tool for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics and research. The mAb-based bELISA provides a serological test in aid of COVID-19 surveillance in animals.\n\nIMPORTANCEAntibody tests are commonly used as a diagnostic tool for detecting host immune response following infection. Serology (antibody) tests complement nucleic acid assays by providing a history of virus exposure, no matter symptoms developed from infection or the infection was asymptomatic. Serology tests for COVID-19 are in high demand, especially when the vaccines become available. They are important to determine the prevalence of the viral infection in a population and identify individuals who have been infected or vaccinated. ELISA is a simple and practically reliable serological test, which allows high-throughput implementation in surveillance studies. Several COVID-19 ELISA kits are available. However, they are mostly designed for human samples and species-specific secondary antibody is required for indirect ELISA format. This paper describes the development of an all species applicable monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based blocking ELISA to facilitate the detection and surveillance of COVID-19 in animals.",

Approved drugs have been tested for their efficacy against COVID-19, and new pharmaceuticals are being developed as a complementary tool to vaccines However, there are not any effective treatment against this disease yet. In this work, a cheap and fast purification method of natural tyrosinase from Agaricus bisporus fresh mushrooms was developed in order to evaluate the potential of this enzyme as a therapeutic protein by the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro protease activity in vitro. Tyrosinase showed a mild inhibition of 3CLpro of around 15%. Thus, different variants of this protein were synthesized through chemical modifications, covalently binding different tailor-made glycans and peptides to the amino terminal groups of the protein. These new tyrosinase conjugates were purified and characterized by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy analyses, and their stability under different conditions. Then all these tyrosinase conjugates were tested in 3CLpro protease inhibition. From them, the conjugate between tyrosinase and dextran-aspartic acid (6kDa) polymer showed the highest inhibition, with an IC50 of 2.5 g/ml and IC90 of 5 g/ml, results that highlight the potential use of modified tyrosinase as a therapeutic protein and opens the possibility of developing this and other enzymes as pharmaceutical drugs against diseases.",

    "abstract": "The presence of deposits of alpha-synuclein fibrils in cells of the brain are a hallmark of several -synucleinopathies, including Parkinsons disease. As most disease cases are not familial, it is likely that external factors play a role in disease onset. One of the external factors that may influence disease onset are viral infections. It has recently been shown that in the presence of SARS-Cov-2 N-protein, S fibril formation is faster and proceeds in an unusual two-step aggregation process. Here, we show that faster fibril formation is not due to a SARS-CoV-2 N-protein-catalysed formation of an aggregation-prone nucleus. Instead, aggregation starts with the formation of a population of mixed S/N-protein fibrils with low affinity for S. After the depletion of N-protein, fibril formation comes to a halt, until a slow transformation to fibrils with characteristics of pure S fibril strains occurs. This transformation into a strain of S fibrils subsequently results in a second phase of fibril growth until a new equilibrium is reached. Our findings point at the possible relevance of fibril strain transformation in the cell-to-cell spread of the S pathology and disease onset.",

    "abstract": "The activation of specific brain areas involved in regulating the vasomotor sympathetic activity can lead to distinct effects in the postganglionic nerves in both physiological and pathological conditions, suggesting that the sympathetic vasomotor activity is differentially coded depending on the nerve outflow and the target organs. Previous studies investigating such patterns have mostly focused on the global energy of the signal. However, recent evidence has suggested that relevant information is coded in the power distribution along the frequency range. Disturbing the sympathoexcitatory vasomotor tone in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) allows to investigate the sympathetic nerve activity in overloaded conditions in both hypertensive and control animals. By disinhibiting the PVN through the microinjection of bicuculline, an antagonist of {gamma}-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAa) receptors, in the Goldblatt (2K1C) rat model of hypertension we addressed the territorially differential changes in the frequency parameters of the renal and splanchnic sympathetic nerve activity (rSNA and sSNA, respectively). We also tested the effect of the systemic administration of losartan, an antagonist of the angiotensin II type 1 receptors (AT1), in the attenuation of the increased rSNA and sSNA in 2K1C rats, once these changes are reported to be dependent on the AT1 activation in the Goldblatt model. Our results revealed that each nerve activity presents its own electrophysiological pattern of frequency-coded rhythm in each group, in basal condition and after bicuculline microinjection, but with no significant differences regarding total power comparison among groups. Additionally, the 2K1C animals treated with losartan showed no decrease in the hypertensive response triggered by the GABAa antagonism when compared to the non-treated 2K1C group. However, their spectral patterns of sympathetic nerve activity were different from the other two groups, suggesting that the systemic blockade of AT1 receptors does not totally recover the basal levels of neither the autonomic symptoms nor the electrophysiological patterns in the Goldblatt model, but act on their spectral frequency distribution. These results suggest that the differential responses evoked by the PVN were preferentially coded in frequency of vasomotor sympathetic responses, indicating that the PVN distinctly modulated each rhythmic activity.\n\nFinancial Support - FAPESP (2019/25295-0)",

    "abstract": "The currently accepted methods for neurotoxicity (NT) testing rely on animal studies. However, high costs and low testing throughput hinder their application for large numbers of chemicals. To overcome these limitations, in vitro methods are currently developed which are based on human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) that allow higher testing throughput at lower costs. We applied six different protocols to generate 3D BrainSphere models for acute NT evaluation. These include three different media for 2D neural induction and two media for subsequent 3D differentiation resulting in self-organized, organotypic neuron/astrocyte microtissues. All induction protocols yielded nearly 100 % nestin-positive hiPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (hiNPCs) yet with different gene expression profiles concerning regional patterning. Moreover, gene expression and immunocytochemistry analyses revealed that the choice of media determines neural differentiation patterns. On the functional level, BrainSpheres exhibited different levels of electrical activity on microelectrode arrays (MEA). Spike sorting allowed BrainSphere functional characterization with the mixed cultures consisting of GABAergic, glutamatergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic, and cholinergic neurons. A test method for acute NT testing, the human multi-neurotransmitter receptor (hMNR) assay, was proposed applying such MEA-based spike sorting. These models are not only promising tools in toxicology but also for drug development and disease modeling.",

In the CA3 area of the hippocampus, recurrent circuit dynamics, including experience-induced plasticity at excitatory synapses, are thought to play a key role in episodic memory encoding and consolidation via rapid generation and flexible selection of neural ensembles. However, in vivo activity of identified inhibitory motifs supporting this recurrent circuitry has remained largely inaccessible, and it is unknown whether CA3 inhibition is also modifiable upon experience. Here we use large-scale, 3-dimensional calcium imaging and retrospective molecular identification in the mouse hippocampus to obtain the first comprehensive description of molecularly-identified CA3 interneuron dynamics during both spatial navigation and sharp-wave ripple (SWR)-associated memory consolidation. Our results uncover subtype-specific dynamics during behaviorally distinct brain-states. Our data also demonstrate predictive, reflective, and experience-driven plastic recruitment of specific inhibitory motifs during SWR-related memory reactivation.

While classical approaches to testing this hypothesis focus on one aspect of the signal, deep learning techniques like generative models can create and manipulate stimuli without targeting a specific feature. Here, we used a technique called style transfer to experimentally test preferences for colour patterns in a fish. We manipulated how similar or dissimilar male body patterns were to their habitats using the Neural Style Transfer (NST) algorithm. We predicted that males whose body patterns are similar to their habitats are easier to process and thus preferred by conspecifics. Our findings suggest that both males and females tend to be sensitive to habitat congruence in their preferences, but to different extents, requiring additional investigation. Nonetheless, this study demonstrates the potential of deep learning techniques in testing hypotheses about animal communication signals.",

    "abstract": "Honey bees communicate navigational information of profitable food to nestmates via dance, a small scale walking pattern. Hungry flies and honey bee foragers initiate a sugar-elicited local search that involves path integration and show similarities with dance behaviour. Using a comparative approach, we explored the temporal dynamics of initiation of local search and dance in flies and honey bees, respectively. Passive displacement experiments showed that feeding and initiation of search can be spatially dissociated in both species. Sugar intake increased the probability to initiate a search but onset of walking starts the path integration system guiding the search. When prevented from walking, the motivation to begin a path integration-based search was sustained for 3 min after sugar intake in flies and bees. In flies, the behavioural parameters of search were significantly reduced for 3 min but were higher than flies that were given no sugar stimulus, indicating some degree of meander. These results suggest that sugar elicits two independent behavioural responses: path integration and increased turning, and initiation and duration of path integration system is temporally more restricted. Honey bee dance experiments demonstrated that the motivation of foragers to initiate dance was sustained for 15 min, whereas the number of circuits declined after 3 min. Based on our findings, we propose that the food-intake during foraging has the capability to activate the path integration system in flies and honey bees, and this interaction might have been elaborated during evolution to guide the walking pattern of the honey bee dance.",

    "abstract": "Animal behavior is organized into nested temporal patterns spanning multiple timescales. This behavior hierarchy is believed to arise from a hierarchical neural architecture: neurons near the top of the hierarchy are involved in planning, selecting, initiating, and maintaining motor programs while those near the bottom of the hierarchy act in concert to produce fine spatiotemporal motor activity. In Caenorhabditis elegans, behavior on a long timescale emerges from ordered and flexible transitions between different behavioral states, such as forward movement, reversal, and turn. On a short timescale, different parts of the animal body coordinate fast rhythmic bending sequences to produce directional movements. Here, we show SAA, a class of interneurons that enable cross-communication between dorsal and ventral head motor neurons, play a dual role in shaping behavioral dynamics on different timescales. On the short timescale, SAA regulate and stabilize rhythmic bending activity during forward movements. On the long timescale, the same neurons suppress spontaneous reversals and facilitate reversal termination by inhibiting RIM, an integrating neuron that helps sustain a behavioral state. These results suggest that feedback from a lower-level cell assembly to a higher-level command center is essential for bridging behavioral dynamics at different levels.",

    "abstract": "Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) of Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) data is a valuable tool for understanding how the brain represents and discriminates between different stimuli. Identifying the spatial and temporal signatures of stimuli is typically a crucial output of these analyses. Such analyses are mainly performed using linear, pairwise, sliding window decoding models. These allow for relative ease of interpretation, e.g. by estimating a time-course of decoding accuracy, but are computationally intensive and can have limited decoding performance. On the other hand, full epoch decoding models, commonly used for brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, can provide better decoding performance. However, they lack methods for interpreting the contributions of spatial and temporal features. In this paper, we propose an approach that combines a multiclass, full epoch decoding model with supervised dimensionality reduction, while still being able to reveal the contributions of spatiotemporal and spectral features using permutation feature importance. We demonstrate the approach on 3 different task MEG datasets using image presentations. Our results demonstrate that this approach consistently achieves higher accuracy than the peak accuracy of a sliding window decoder while estimating the relevant spatiotemporal features in the MEG signal. Finally, we show that our multiclass model can also be used for pairwise decoding, eliminating the computational burden of training separate models for each pairwise combination of stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Parvalbumin (PV)-positive GABAergic cells provide robust perisomatic inhibition to neighboring pyramidal neurons and regulate brain oscillations. Alterations in PV interneuron connectivity and function in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) have been consistently reported in psychiatric disorders associated with cognitive rigidity, suggesting that PV cell deficits could be a core cellular phenotype in these disorders. p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) regulates the time course of PV cell maturation in a cell-autonomous fashion. Whether p75NTR expression during postnatal development affects adult prefrontal PV cell connectivity and cognitive function is unknown. We generated transgenic mice with conditional knockout (cKO) of p75NTR in postnatal PV cells. We analysed PV cell connectivity and recruitment following a tail pinch, by immunolabeling and confocal imaging, in naive mice or following p75NTR re-expression in pre- or post-adolescent mice using Cre-dependent viral vectors. Cognitive flexibility was evaluated using behavioral tests. PV cell-specific p75NTR deletion increased both PV cell synapse density and the number of PV cells surrounded by perineuronal nets, a marker of mature PV cells, in adult PFC but not visual cortex. Both phenotypes were rescued by viral-mediated re-introduction of p75NTR in pre-adolescent but not in post-adolescent PFC. Prefrontal cortical PV cells failed to upregulated c-Fos following a tail-pinch stimulation in adult cKO mice. Finally, cKO mice showed impaired fear memory extinction learning as well as deficits in a rule set-shifting task. These findings suggest that p75NTR expression in adolescent PV cells contributes to the finetuning of their connectivity and promotes cognitive flexibility in adulthood.",

    "abstract": "The endocannabinoid system is prominently implicated in the control of cocaine reinforcement due to its relevant role in synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter modulation in the mesocorticolimbic system. The inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), and the resulting increase in anandamide and other N-acylethanolamines, represents a promising strategy for reducing drug seeking. In the present study, we aimed to assess the effects of the FAAH inhibitor URB597 (1 mg/kg) on crucial features of cocaine addictive-like behaviour in mice. Therefore, we tested the effects of URB597 on acquisition of cocaine (0.6 mg/kg/inf) self-administration, compulsive-like cocaine intake and cue-induced drug-seeking behaviour during withdrawal. URB597 reduced cocaine intake under conditioned punishment while having no impact on acquisition. This result was associated to increased cannabinoid receptor 1 gene expression in the ventral striatum and medium spiny neurons activation in the nucleus accumbens shell. Moreover, URB597 reduced cue-induced drug-seeking behaviour during prolonged abstinence and prevented the withdrawal-induced increase in FAAH gene expression in the ventral striatum. In this case, URB597 decreased activation of medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens core. Our findings evidence the prominent role of endocannabinoids in the development of cocaine addictive-like behaviours and support the potential of FAAH inhibition as a therapeutical target for the treatment of cocaine addiction.",

    "abstract": "Human interactions contain potent social cues that not only meet the eye but also the ear. Although research has identified a region in the posterior superior temporal sulcus as being particularly sensitive to visually presented social interactions (SI-pSTS), its response to auditory interactions has not been tested. Here, we used fMRI to explore brain response to auditory interactions, with a focus on temporal regions known to be important in auditory processing and social interaction perception. In Experiment 1, monolingual participants listened to two-speaker conversations (intact or sentence-scrambled) and one-speaker narrations in both a known and unknown language. Speaker number and conversational coherence were explored in separately localised regions-of-interest (ROI). In Experiment 2, bilingual participants were scanned to explore the role of language comprehension. Combining univariate and multivariate analyses, we found initial evidence for a heteromodal response to social interactions in SI-pSTS. Specifically, right SI-pSTS preferred auditory interactions over control stimuli and represented information about both speaker number and interactive coherence. Bilateral temporal voice areas (TVA) showed a similar, but less specific, profile. Exploratory analyses identified another auditory-interaction sensitive area in anterior STS. Indeed, direct comparison suggests modality specific tuning, with SI-pSTS preferring visual information while aSTS prefers auditory information. Altogether, these results suggest that right SI-pSTS is a heteromodal region that represents information about social interactions in both visual and auditory domains. Future work is needed to clarify the roles of TVA and aSTS in auditory interaction perception and further probe right SI-pSTS interaction-selectivity using non-semantic prosodic cues.\n\nHighlights- Novel work investigating social interaction perception in the auditory domain.\n- Visually defined SI-pSTS shows a heteromodal response profile to interactions.\n- Yet, it prefers visual to auditory stimuli. The reverse was found for anterior STS.\n- Temporal voice areas show qualitatively different response compared to SI-pSTS.\n- Future studies are needed to corroborate the unique role of right SI-pSTS.",

We ask the question whether the cerebellum also implements reinforcement learning algorithm, especially the essential reward-prediction error. By tensor component analysis on two-photon Ca2+ imaging data, we recently demonstrated that a component of climbing fiber inputs in the lateral zones of mouse cerebellum Crus II represents cognitive error signals for Go/No-go auditory discrimination task. Here, we applied the Q-learning model to quantitatively reproduce Go/No-go learning behaviors, as well as to compute reinforcement learning variables including reward, predicted reward and reward-prediction error within each learning trial. Climbing fiber inputs to the cognitive-error component are strongly correlated with the negative reward-prediction error, and decreased as learning progressed. Assuming parallel-fiber Purkinje-cell synaptic plasticity, Purkinje cells of this component could acquire necessary motor commands based on the negative reward-prediction error conveyed by their climbing fiber inputs, thus providing an actor of reinforcement learning.",

    "abstract": "Perceptual learning is a powerful mechanism to enhance perceptual abilities and to form robust memory representations of previously unfamiliar sounds. Memory formation through repeated exposure takes place even for random and complex acoustic patterns devoid of semantic content. The current study sought to scrutinise how perceptual learning of random acoustic patterns is shaped by two potential modulators: temporal regularity of pattern repetition and listeners attention. To this end, we adapted an established implicit learning paradigm and presented short acoustic sequences that could contain embedded repetitions of a certain sound segment (i.e., pattern) or not. During each experimental block, one repeating pattern recurred across multiple trials, while the other patterns were presented in only one trial. During the presentation of sound sequences that contained either temporally regular or jittered within-trial pattern repetitions, participants attention was directed either towards or away from the auditory stimulation. Overall, we found a memory-related modulation of the event-related potential (ERP) and an increase in inter-trial phase coherence for patterns that recurred across multiple trials (compared to non- recurring patterns), accompanied by a performance increase in a (within-trial) repetition detection task when listeners attended the sounds. Remarkably, we show a memory-related ERP effect even for the first pattern occurrence per sequence when participants attended the sounds, but not when they were engaged in a visual distractor task. These findings suggest that learning of unfamiliar sound patterns is robust against temporal irregularity and inattention, but attention facilitates access to established memory representations upon first occurrence within a sequence.",

A recent study by Neuser and colleagues [1] provided novel evidence for this process in humans, by reporting a positive effect of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) on the invigoration of reward-seeking behaviors, especially for food rewards.\n\nObjectiveWe conducted an independent direct replication of Neuser et al. [1], to assess the robustness of their findings.\n\nMethodsFollowing the original study, we used a single-blind, sham-controlled, randomized cross-over design. We applied left-sided taVNS in healthy human volunteers (n=40), while they performed an effort allocation task in which they had to work for monetary and food rewards. The replication study was purely confirmatory in that it strictly followed the analysis plans and scripts used by Neuser et al. [1].\n\nResultsAlthough, in line with Neuser et al. [1], we found strong effects of task variables on effort invigoration and effort maintenance, we failed to replicate their key finding: taVNS did not increase the strength of invigoration (p = .62); the data were five times more likely (BF10 = 0.19) under the null hypothesis. We also found substantial evidence against an effect of taVNS on effort maintenance (p = 0.50; BF10 = 0.20).\n\nConclusionsOur results provide evidence against the idea that taVNS boosts the motivational drive to work for rewards. Our study also highlights the need for direct replications of influential taVNS studies.",

Whereas a plethora of calcium-permeable channels may generate distinct calcium signatures and contribute to response specificities, the mechanisms by which calcium signatures are decoded is poorly understood.

In pollen tubes, naturally displaying a physiological calcium range, CPK21-FRET, but not CPK23-FRET, report activity oscillations with similar features to cytosolic calcium, suggesting an isoform-specific calcium dependency and reversibility of the conformational change. In guard cells CPK21-FRET identifies CPK21 as a decoder of signal-specific calcium signatures in response to ABA and flg22.

    "abstract": "The first step in gene expression is the transcription of DNA sequences into RNA. Regulation at the level of transcription leads to changes in steady-state concentrations of RNA transcripts, affecting the flux of downstream functions and ultimately cellular phenotypes. Changes in transcript levels are routinely followed in cellular contexts via genome-wide sequencing techniques. However, in vitro mechanistic studies of transcription have lagged with respect to throughput. Here, we describe the use of a real-time, fluorescent-aptamer-based method to quantitate steady-state transcription rates of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis RNA polymerase. We present clear controls to show that the assay specifically reports on promoter-dependent, full-length RNA transcription rates that are in good agreement with the kinetics determined by gel-resolved, -32P NTP incorporation experiments. We illustrate how the time-dependent changes in fluorescence can be used to measure regulatory effects of nucleotide concentrations and identity, RNAP and DNA concentrations, transcription factors, and antibiotics. Our data showcase the ability to easily perform hundreds of parallel steady-state measurements across varying conditions with high precision and reproducibility to facilitate the study of the molecular mechanisms of bacterial transcription.\n\nSignificance StatementRNA polymerase transcription mechanisms have largely been determined from in vitro kinetic and structural biology methods. In contrast to the limited throughput of these approaches, in vivo RNA sequencing provides genome-wide measurements but lacks the ability to dissect direct biochemical from indirect genetic mechanisms. Here, we present a method that bridges this gap, permitting high-throughput fluorescence-based measurements of in vitro steady-state transcription kinetics. We illustrate how an RNA-aptamer-based detection system can be used to generate quantitative information on direct mechanisms of transcriptional regulation and discuss the far-reaching implications for future applications.",

Initial PAM binding by Cas12a leads to formation of a 20bp R-loop between the complementary crRNA guide and target strand. Following specificity-determining R-loop formation, both DNA strands undergo RuvC-mediated cleavage. Current structures of Cas12a bound to its target only show the R-loop after formation, leaving an important gap in knowledge as to how Cas12a accommodates the extending R-loop and coordinates R-loop formation with nuclease activation. Here, we use cryo-EM to capture a series of kinetically trapped Cas12a R-loop intermediates and observe how Cas12a delivers each DNA strand into the RuvC active site. We show that Cas12a first interrogates target DNA via a 5bp seed, followed by dramatic Rec domain conformational flexibility to accommodate R-loop extension. Only during formation of the final R-loop base pairs do the Rec and BH domains engage in the majority of contacts with the R-loop. R-loop completion leads the nontarget strand to displace the RuvC lid and kink into the active site via a base stacking interaction. Following nontarget strand cleavage, we observe substantial Rec2 and Nuc domain dynamics as the TS is brought to the RuvC active site. Our kinetics-guided structural snapshots provide a comprehensive model describing Cas12a DNA targeting and highlight mechanistic differences between Cas12a and Cas9.",

This study aims to ascertain the occurrence of ISAba1-linked OXA carbapenemase genes and its relevance to carbapenem resistance level in Acinetobacter baumannii. This hospital based descriptive study was conducted at Shahid Gangalal National Heart Center, Kathmandu, Nepal. An overall of 1,291 clinical specimens received for routine culture and antibiotic susceptibility testing throughout the study period were included in this study. Identification of Acinetobacter baumannii was validated through detection of intrinsic blaOXA-51-like gene by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Antibiotic susceptibility was tested by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion approach and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of meropenem was assessed through agar dilution method. Uniplex PCR assays were performed to detect genes encoding oxacillinases and ISAba1. Upstream association of insertion element, ISAba1 to oxacillinase genes was assessed through PCR mapping strategy using ISAba1F and OXA-51R/OXA-23R primers. Out of the 340 bacteria isolated, only 40 (11.8%) were Acinetobacter baumannii. All isolates were resistant against meropenem with MIC value ranging from 16-256 g/ml. blaOXA-23-like genes was present in every isolate but blaOXA-58 in just two isolates (5%). All isolates had ISAba1 either above blaOXA-23-like or blaOXA-51-like gene. Higher MIC90 value of meropenem (243.20 g/ml) was found in A. baumannii cluster with ISAba1-linked upstream to both blaOXA-23-like and blaOXA-51-like genes, thus depicting their eminent role to enhanced carbapenem resistance. Acinetobacter baumannii isolates with ISAba1-linked oxacillinase genes are rapidly emerging in clinical settings of Nepal.

    "abstract": "In recent years, the emergence of soybean stay-green syndrome (SGS), also referred to as \"zhengqing\", in the Huang-Huai-Hai region of China has resulted in significant yield losses, with some areas experiencing a complete reduction in seed yield. SGS is a phenomenon characterized by the delayed senescence of soybean, resulting in stay-green leaves, flat pods, and stunted seed development at harvest. Our group was the first to identify a distinct geminivirus, named soybean stay-green associated geminivirus (SoSGV), as the causative agent of SGS by fulfilling Kochs postulate. To further understand the epidemiology of SoSGV, in this study, we collected 368 stay-green samples from 17 regions in 8 provinces including the Huang-Huai-Hai region and surrounding areas of China. The results showed that 228 samples tested positive for SoSGV (61.96%), and 96.93% of these positive samples showed severe pod deflation. Our epidemiological assessment reveals SGS caused by the SoSGV is prevalent in the fields, and it is undergoing geographical expansion and genetic differentiation. Additionally, we determined the other natural hosts grown in the Huang-Huai-Hai region of China. By capturing insects in the field and conducting laboratory vector transmission tests, we confirmed that the common brown leafhopper (Orosius orientalis) is the transmitting vector of SoSGV. With a better understanding of the epidemiology of SoSGV and its transmission, we can develop more effective strategies for managing and mitigating its impact on soybean yields.",

    "abstract": "Subverting the host immune response to inhibit inflammation is a key virulence factor of Yersinia pestis. The inflammatory cascade is tightly controlled via the sequential action of lipid and protein mediators of inflammation. Because delayed inflammation is essential for Y. pestis to cause lethal infection, defining the mechanisms used by Y. pestis to manipulate the inflammatory cascade is necessary to understand this pathogens virulence. While previous studies have established that Y. pestis actively inhibits the expression of host proteins that mediate inflammation, there is currently a gap in our understanding of inflammatory lipid mediator response during plague. Here we use in vivo lipidomics to define the synthesis of lipid mediators of inflammation within the lungs during pneumonic plague. Interestingly, while we observed an early cyclooxygenase response during pneumonic plague, there was a significant delay in the synthesis of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a pro-inflammatory lipid chemoattractant and activator of immune cells. Furthermore, in vitro studies with primary leukocytes from mice and humans further revealed that Y. pestis actively inhibited the synthesis of LTB4. Finally, using Y. pestis mutants in the Ysc type 3 secretion system (T3SS) and Yersinia outer protein (Yop) effectors, we demonstrate that leukocytes recognize the T3SS to initiate the synthesis of LTB4 rapidly. However, the Yop effectors secreted through the same system effectively inhibit this host response. Together, these data demonstrate that Y. pestis actively inhibits the synthesis of LTB4, an inflammatory lipid, required for rapid recruitment of leukocytes to the site of infection.\n\nAuthor SummaryYersinia pestis, the bacteria that causes plague, targets the hosts innate immune response to inhibit inflammation. Because the generation of this non-inflammatory environment is required for infection, we are interested in mechanisms used by Y. pestis to block inflammation. Lipid mediators are potent signaling molecules that regulate multiple host immune responses, including inflammation. While there have been studies on how Y. pestis blocks the proteins that mediate inflammation, there is a gap in our understanding of the inflammatory lipid mediator response during plague. Here we show that Y. pestis inhibits the production of one of these critical lipid mediators, leukotriene B4, by host immune cells. Furthermore, we identify both the signals that induce LTB4 production by leukocytes and the mechanisms used by Y. pestis to inhibit this process. Together, these data represent the first comprehensive analysis of inflammatory lipids produced during plague and improve our current understanding of how Y. pestis manipulates the host immune response to generate a permissive non-inflammatory environment required for bacterial colonization.",

    "abstract": "Sinorhizobium meliloti is a soil bacterium that establishes a symbiosis within root nodules of legumes (Medicago sativa, for example) where it fixes atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia and obtains in return carbon sources and other nutrients. In this symbiosis, S. meliloti undergoes a drastic cellular change leading to a terminal differentiated form (called bacteroid) characterized by genome endoreduplication, increase of cell size and high membrane permeability. The bacterial cell cycle (mis)regulation is at the heart of this differentiation process. In free-living cells, the master regulator CtrA ensures the progression of cell cycle by activating cell division (controlled by the tubulin-like protein FtsZ) and simultaneously inhibiting supernumerary DNA replication, while on the other hand the downregulation of CtrA and FtsZ is essential for bacteroid differentiation during symbiosis, preventing endosymbiont division and permitting genome endoreduplication. Little is known in S. meliloti about regulators of CtrA and FtsZ, as well as the processes that control bacteroid development. Here, we combine cell biology, biochemistry and bacterial genetics approaches to understand the function(s) of FcrX, a new factor that controls both CtrA and FtsZ, in free-living growth and in symbiosis. Depletion of the essential gene fcrX led to abnormally high levels of FtsZ and CtrA and minicell formation. Using multiple complementary techniques, we showed that FcrX is able to interact physically with FtsZ and CtrA. Moreover, its transcription is controlled by CtrA itself and displays an oscillatory pattern in the cell cycle. We further showed that, despite a weak homology with FliJ-like proteins, only FcrX proteins from closely-related species are able to complement S. meliloti fcrX function. Finally, deregulation of FcrX showed abnormal symbiotic behaviors in plants suggesting a putative role of this factor during bacteroid differentiation. In conclusion, FcrX is the first known cell cycle regulator that acts directly on both, CtrA and FtsZ, thereby controlling cell cycle, division and symbiotic differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial-fungal interactions (BFIs) can shape the structure of microbial communities, but the small molecules mediating these BFIs are often understudied. We explored various optimization steps for our microbial culture and chemical extraction protocols for bacterial-fungal co-cultures, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) revealed that metabolomic profiles are mainly comprised of fungi derived features, indicating that fungi are the key contributors to small molecule mediated BFIs. LC-inductively coupled plasma MS (LC-ICP-MS) and MS/MS based dereplication using database searching revealed the presence of several known fungal specialized metabolites and structurally related analogues in these extracts, including siderophores such as desferrichrome, desferricoprogen, and palmitoylcoprogen. Among these analogues, a novel putative coprogen analogue possessing a terminal carboxylic acid motif was identified from Scopulariopsis spp. JB370, a common cheese rind fungus, and its structure was elucidated via MS/MS fragmentation. Based on these findings, filamentous fungal species appear to be capable of producing multiple siderophores with potentially different biological roles (i.e. various affinities for different forms of iron). These findings highlight that fungal species are important contributors to microbiomes via their production of abundant specialized metabolites and their role in complex communities should continue to be a priority.",

    "abstract": "Erwinia carotovora Ecc15 is a vector-borne phytopathogen that relies on insects to be transmitted between plant hosts. To interact with its hosts, this bacterium depends on host-specific bacterial traits. Plant tissue maceration depends on production of plant cell wall degrading enzymes (PCWDE), while survival in the digestive tract of the insect requires the Erwinia virulence factor (evf). Evf expression is responsible for the cost of Ecc15 infection in Drosophila melanogaster and overexpression is lethal to the insect host. Therefore, its expression must be well controlled. Expression of evf and PCWDEs is co-regulated by quorum sensing via the transcriptional regulator Hor. Since virulence factors are often controlled by multiple signals, we asked which additional factors regulate evf expression. Using a genetic screen, we identified the sensor histidine kinase arcB and a new TetR-like regulator (named herein as lvtR, after Low Virulence Transcriptional Repressor), as novel regulators not only of evf, but also of pelA, which encodes a major PCWDE. We further demonstrate that arcB and lvtR mutants have reduced plant tissue maceration and reduced development delay and lethality in Drosophila melanogaster, compared to wild-type bacteria. Thus showing the importance of these regulators in the establishment of Erwinia-host-vector interactions. We also found that ArcB and LvtR regulation converges on Hor, independently of quorum sensing, to co-regulate expression of both plant and insect bacterial interaction factors during plant infection. Taken together, our results reveal a novel regulatory hub that enables Ecc15 to integrate quorum sensing responses and environmental cues to co-regulate traits required for infection of both the plant and the insect vector. Moreover, we show that ArcB regulation of bacteria-host interaction processes is conserved in other bacteria.\n\nAuthor SummaryVector-borne pathogens depend on continuous cycles of replication and transmission between hosts and vectors, requiring multiple factors to interact with each of the hosts. The expression of these multiple interaction factors can be very costly, so it is expected that regulation of virulence has been evolutionarily tuned to produce expressions patterns that minimize the cost of establishing the infection while maximizing transmission efficiency of the pathogen. Here, we investigate the tripartite interaction between Ecc15, a plant and an insect, and show that quorum sensing, a widely conserved sensory regulator arcB and a regulator of previously unknown function, lvtR, converge to simultaneously co-regulate the expression of bacterial factors required for these interactions. Gene expression regulation is channeled through the conserved regulator Hor, which serves as a molecular hub for the integration of these multiple signals. Our data suggest that integration of multiple signals to co-regulate plant and insect associated factors ensure fine-tune titration of gene expression and maximization of bacterial energetic resources.",

Strain LLG6346-3.1T used the seaweed polysaccharide alginic acid as sole carbon source which was vigorously liquefied. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the bacterium is affiliated to the genus Zobellia (family Flavobacteriaceae, class Flavobacteriia). Strain LLG6346-3.1T exhibited 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values of 98.5 and 98.3 % to the type strains of Zobellia russellii and Zobellia roscoffensis respectively, and of 97.4-98.2 % to other species of the genus Zobellia.

Digital DNA-DNA hybridization predictions by the ANI and GGDC methods between strain LLG6346-3.1T and other members of the genus Zobellia showed values of 76-88 %, and below 37 %, respectively. The phenotypic, phylogenetic and genomic analyses show that strain LLG6346-3.1T is distinct from species of the genus Zobellia with validly published names and that it represents a novel species of the genus Zobellia, for which the name Zobellia alginoliquefaciens sp. nov. is proposed.

    "abstract": "The poxvirus lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) is the etiological agent of lumpy skin disease (LSD), a severe disease of cattle and water buffalo that is characterised by numerous necrotic cutaneous nodules. LSD is a rapidly emerging disease, spreading into and across the Middle East, eastern Europe, and Asia in the past decade. The disease causes substantial production and economic losses in rural communities and affected regions. LSDV is mechanically transmitted by haematophagous arthropods including stable flies (Stomoxys calcitrans), however our understanding of this mechanical transmission method is sparse. A secreted saliva collection methodology using a modified artificial membrane feeding system was optimised for S. calcitrans and used to collect and characterise secreted S. calcitrans saliva. Saliva was mixed with LSDV and shown not to affect virus growth in primary bovine fibroblasts. S. calcitrans saliva or spot-feeding by S. calcitrans was then incorporated into a bovine in vivo experimental model of LSD to determine if either influenced disease pathogenesis. S. calcitrans saliva resulted in fewer animals developing disease, however this difference was not statistically significant. Spot-feeding with S. calcitrans prior to inoculation did not alter the number of animals that developed disease or the overall severity of disease however disease progression was accelerated as demonstrated by the appearance of cutaneous nodules, detection of viral DNA in the blood stream, and production of neutralising antibodies. This shows that S. calcitrans influence disease kinetics through co-incident bite trauma and/or saliva deposition. This increases our understanding of LSDV pathogenesis and highlights the overlooked importance of mechanical vectors in pathogen transmission.\n\nAuthor summaryInsect vectors are important conduits for the transmission of pathogens that cause diseases such as Zika, dengue, malaria, and lumpy skin disease. Biological vector-borne transmission incorporates a replication phase for the pathogen in the insect, whereas no replication occurs in the vector during mechanical transmission. When the insect bites the host it inoculates a pathogen whilst also delivering arthropod-derived factors such as saliva components and causing tissue trauma through biting and probing. Arthropod saliva and/or bite trauma have been shown to enhance the speed and severity of disease following inoculation with a range of biologically transmitted viruses. This study examined if this was true also for the mechanically transmitted pathogen lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV). LSDV is a neglected pathogen that causes severe systemic disease in cattle and is transmitted mechanically by the stable fly Stomoxys calcitrans. Using an experimental bovine model of LSD, we found that disease occurred more rapidly when virus was delivered in association with the bites of uninfected flies. This work has increased our knowledge of lumpy skin disease virus transmission, and the discovery that disease outcome can be impacted by previously overlooked mechanical insect vectors should prompt further investigation into this mechanism of transmission.",

    "abstract": "Malaria parasites modify their host erythrocyte in multiple ways, leading to changes in the deformability, adhesiveness and permeability of the host erythrocyte. Most of these changes are mediated by proteins exported from the parasite to the host erythrocyte, where these proteins interact with the host cell cytoskeleton or form complexes in the plasma membrane of the infected erythrocyte. In addition, malaria parasites induce the formation of membranous compartments - the parasitophorous vacuole, the tubovesicular network, the Maurers clefts and small vesicles - within the infected erythrocyte, a cell that is normally devoid of internal membranes. After infection, changes also occur in the composition and asymmetry of the erythrocyte plasma membrane. Although many aspects of the mechanism of export of parasite proteins have become clear, the mechanism by which these membranous compartments are formed and expanded is almost entirely unknown. To determine whether parasite-derived phospholipids play a part in these processes, we applied a metabolic labelling technique that allows phosphatidylcholine to be labelled with a fluorophore. As the host erythrocyte cannot synthesize phospholipids, within infected erythrocytes, only parasite-derived phosphatidylcholine will be labelled with this technique. The results revealed that phosphatidylcholine produced by the parasite is distributed throughout the infected erythrocyte, including the TVN and the erythrocyte plasma membrane, but not Maurers clefts. Interestingly, labelled phospholipids were also detected in the erythrocyte plasma membrane very soon after invasion of the parasites, indicating that the parasite may add phospholipids to the host erythrocyte during invasion.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial microbiota promotes the life cycle of the intestine-dwelling whipworm Trichuris by mediating hatching of parasite eggs ingested by the mammalian host. Despite the enormous disease burden associated with Trichuris colonization, the mechanisms underlying this transkingdom interaction have been obscure. Here, we used a multiscale microscopy approach to define the structural events associated with bacteria-mediated hatching of eggs for the murine model parasite Trichuris muris. Through the combination of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and serial block face SEM (SBFSEM), we visualized the outer surface morphology of the shell and generated 3D structures of the egg and larva during the hatching process. These images revealed that exposure to hatching-inducing bacteria catalyzed asymmetric degradation of the polar plugs prior to exit by the larva. Although unrelated bacteria induced similar loss of electron density and dissolution of the structural integrity of the plugs, egg hatching was most efficient in the presence of bacteria that bound poles with high density such as Staphylococcus aureus. Consistent with the ability of taxonomically distant bacteria to induce hatching, additional results suggest chitinase released from larva within the eggs degrade the plugs from the inside instead of enzymes produced by bacteria in the external environment. These findings define at ultrastructure resolution the evolutionary adaptation of a parasite for the microbe-rich environment of the mammalian gut.",

    "abstract": "Cell-surface signalling (CSS) is a signal transfer system of Gram-negative bacteria used to detect extracellular signals and modulate gene transcription in response. These three-protein systems are formed by an outer membrane receptor, a cytoplasmic membrane-embedded anti-{sigma} factor and a cytosolic extracytoplasmic function {sigma} factor ({sigma}ECF). In absence of an inducing signal, the anti-{sigma} factor binds to and keeps the {sigma}ECF factor sequestered, thus preventing its interaction with the RNA polymerase and the transcription of signal response genes. Presence of the signal triggers a signalling cascade that extends from the outer membrane to the cytosol and results in {sigma}ECF factor activation. Recently, we and others have reported that CSS {sigma}ECF factor activation requires the regulated and sequential proteolysis of the cognate anti-{sigma} factor, and the function of the Prc and RseP proteases. However, many features of this proteolytic cascade are still unclear. In this work, we have identified another protease that modulates CSS activity, namely the periplasmic carboxyl-terminal processing protease CtpA. We show that both CtpA and the previously identified protease Prc control CSS activation by modulating the levels of the anti-{sigma} factor. CtpA functions upstream of Prc in the proteolytic cascade and seems to prevent the Prc-mediated proteolysis of the CSS anti-{sigma} factor. Importantly, using zebrafish embryos and the A549 cell line as hosts, we show that mutants in the rseP and ctpA proteases of the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa are considerably attenuated in virulence while the prc mutation increases virulence likely by enhancing the production of outer membrane vesicles. Because proteases are druggable proteins, the identification of regulatory proteases involved in P. aeruginosa virulence holds promise for the development of novel strategies to fight this clinically relevant pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Genetic information is duplicated via the highly regulated process of DNA replication. The machinery coordinating this process, the replisome, encounters many challenges, including replication fork-stalling lesions that threaten the accurate and timely transmission of genetic information. Cells have multiple mechanisms to repair or bypass lesions that would otherwise compromise DNA replication1,2. We have previously shown that proteasome shuttle proteins, DNA Damage Inducible 1 and 2 (DDI1/2) function to regulate Replication Termination Factor 2 (RTF2) at the stalled replisome, allowing for replication fork stabilization and restart3. Here we show that RTF2 regulates replisome localization of RNase H2, a heterotrimeric enzyme responsible for removing RNA in the context of RNA-DNA heteroduplexes4-6. We show that during unperturbed DNA replication, RTF2, like RNase H2, is required to maintain normal replication fork speeds. However, persistent RTF2 and RNase H2 at stalled replication forks compromises the replication stress response, preventing efficient replication restart. Such restart is dependent on PRIM1, the primase component of DNA polymerase -primase. Our data show a fundamental need for regulation of replication-coupled ribonucleotide incorporation during normal replication and the replication stress response that is achieved through RTF2. We also provide evidence for PRIM1 function in direct replication restart following replication stress in mammalian cells.",

    "abstract": "The encoding step of translation involves attachment of amino acids to cognate tRNAs by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, themselves the product of coded peptide synthesis. So, the question arises -- before these enzymes evolved, how were primordial tRNAs selectively aminoacylated? Here we demonstrate enzyme-free, sequence-dependent, chemoselective aminoacylation of RNA. We investigated two potentially prebiotic routes to aminoacyl-tRNA acceptor stem-overhang mimics and analyzed those oligonucleotides undergoing the most efficient aminoacylation. Overhang sequences do not influence the chemoselectivity of aminoacylation by either route. For aminoacyl-transfer from a mixed anhydride donor strand, the chemoselectivity and stereoselectivity of aminoacylation depends on the terminal three base pairs of the stem. The results support early suggestions of a second genetic code in the acceptor stem.\n\nOne-Sentence SummarySelectivity of RNA stem-overhang aminoacylation is controlled by the terminal trinucleotide sequence of the stem.",

    "abstract": "Cell-surface receptor complexes mediated by pro-inflammatory Interleukin-12 and -23, both validated therapeutic targets, are incompletely understood due to the lack of structural insights into their complete extracellular assemblies. Furthermore, there is a paucity of structural details describing the IL-12:receptor interaction interfaces, in contrast to IL23:receptor complexes. Here we report cryo-EM structures of fully assembled IL-12/IL-23:receptor complexes comprising the complete extracellular segments of the cognate receptors. The structures reveal important commonalities but also surprisingly diverse features. Whereas IL-12 and IL-23 both utilize a conspicuously presented aromatic residue on their -subunit as a hotspot to interact with the N-terminal Ig-domain of their high affinity receptors, only IL-12 juxtaposes receptor domains proximal to the cell-membrane. Collectively, our findings will enable a cytokine-specific interrogation of IL-12 and IL-23 signaling in physiology and disease.",

    "abstract": "The centromere is an epigenetic mark that is a loading site for the kinetochore during meiosis and mitosis. This mark is characterized by the H3 variant CENP-A, known as CID in Drosophila. In Drosophila, CENP-C is critical for maintaining CID at the centromeres and directly recruits outer kinetochore proteins after nuclear envelope break down. It is not known, however, if these two functions require the same CENP-C molecules. Furthermore, in Drosophila and many other metazoan oocytes, centromere maintenance and kinetochore assembly are separated by an extended prophase. Consistent with studies in mammals, CID is relatively stable and does not need to be expressed during prophase to remain at high levels in metaphase I of meiosis. Expression of CID during prophase can even be deleterious, causing ectopic localization to non-centromeric chromatin, abnormal meiosis and sterility. In contrast to CID, maintaining high levels of CENP-C requires expression during prophase. Confirming the importance of this loading, we found CENP-C prophase loading is required for multiple meiotic functions. In early meiotic prophase, CENP-C loading is required for sister centromere cohesion and centromere clustering. In late meiotic prophase, CENP-C loading is required to recruit kinetochore proteins. CENP-C is one of the few proteins identified in which expression during prophase is required for meiotic chromosome segregation. An implication of these results is that the failure to maintain recruitment of CENP-C during the extended prophase in oocytes would result in chromosome segregation errors in oocytes.\n\nAuthor SummaryMeiosis in oocytes of diverse organisms, including humans and Drosophila, is characterized by a long prophase pause and a cell cycle arrest in meiosis I or meiosis II. These pauses could be a challenge for centromeres, whose components are replenished during G1, and then must remain with the chromosomes until the meiotic divisions. We have investigated the stability, prophase dynamics and function of centromere protein CENP-C. We show that CENP-C expression and loading onto centromeres during prophase is required for multiple meiotic functions. In contrast, the expression of other centromere partners CID/CENP-A and CAL1 is not required during meiotic prophase. Furthermore, expression of CID during prophase can be deleterious and result in ectopic kinetochore formation. CENP-C loading in prophase is required for sister centromere cohesion and kinetochore assembly. Our results provide the first description of CENP-C dynamics during meiosis and show that prophase expression is required for oocyte spindle assembly and function. CENP-C is among a small number of proteins that are required for the meiotic divisions but are loaded prior to prometaphase. Failure to maintain these proteins during the long prophase of oocyte meiosis may contribute to the increased aneuploidy associated with advanced maternal age.",

    "abstract": "Chorismate mutase (CM) and cyclohexadienyl dehydratase (CDT) catalyze two subsequent reactions in the intracellular biosynthesis of phenylalanine. Surprisingly, exported CMs and CDTs exist in bacterial pathogens. Here, we report the discovery of novel and extremely rare exported bifunctional fusion enzymes, consisting of fused CM and CDT domains. Such enzymes were found in only nine bacterial species belonging to non-pathogenic {gamma}- or {beta}-proteobacteria. In {gamma}-proteobacterial fusion enzymes, the CM domain is N-terminal to the CDT domain, whereas in {beta}-proteobacteria the order is inversed. The CM domains share 15-20% sequence identity with the AroQ{gamma} class CM holotype of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (*MtCM), and the CDT domains 40-60% identity with the exported monofunctional enzyme of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PheC). In vitro kinetics revealed a Km <7 {micro}M, much lower than for *MtCM, whereas kinetic parameters are similar for CDT domains and PheC. There is no feedback inhibition of CM or CDT by the pathways end product Phe, and no catalytic benefit of the domain fusion compared to engineered single-domain constructs. The fusion enzymes of Aequoribacter fuscus, Janthinobacterium sp. HH01, and Duganella sacchari were crystallized and their structures refined to 1.6, 1.7, and 2.4 [A] resolution, respectively. Neither the crystal structures nor size-exclusion chromatography show evidence for substrate channeling or higher oligomeric structure that could account for cooperation of CM and CDT active sites. The genetic neighborhood with genes encoding transporter and substrate binding proteins suggests that these exported bifunctional fusion enzymes may participate in signaling systems rather than in the biosynthesis of Phe.",

    "abstract": "Ubiquitination is a complex and reversible protein post-translational modification in which the subsequent action of enzymes belonging to three different families, broadly referred to as E1, E2 and E3, results in the covalent linking of ubiquitin to a target protein. While this linkage is canonically an isopeptide bond between the C-terminus of ubiquitin and the lysine residue of the target protein, Ser, Thr, and Tyr can also be susceptible to ubiquitination through an oxyester bond. Once ubiquitinated, multiple units of ubiquitin can be attached to the initial ubiquitin thus extending it to a chain of ubiquitins. Ubiquitination regulates multiple cellular processes, but it is best known as a modification that targets proteins for proteasomal degradation following the formation poly-ubiquitin chains linked through lysine 48 or 63 of ubiquitin. Dysregulation of ubiquitination has been associated with multiple types of cancer and efforts have been carried out to develop technologies that lead to the identification of inhibitors of the enzymes involved in the ubiquitination cascade. Herein, we present the development of a FRET-based assay that allows us to monitor auto-ubiquitination of DTX3L, a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase. Our method shows a robust signal window with a robust average Z factor of 0.76. From a validatory screening experiment we have identified the first molecules that inhibit DTX3L with potencies in the low micromolar range. Additionally, we have expanded the system to study deubiquitinases such as USP28 that lead to reduction of FRET due to hydrolysis of fluorescent poly-Ub chains.",

    "abstract": "Human Respiratory Syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of infantile bronchiolitis in the developed world and of childhood deaths in resource-poor settings. The elderly and the immunosuppressed are also affected. It is a major unmet target for vaccines and anti-viral drugs. RSV assembles and buds from the host cell plasma membrane by forming infections viral particles which are mostly filamentous. A key interaction during RSV assembly is the interaction of plasma membrane lipids with the Matrix (M) protein layer forming at assembly sites. Although the structure of RSV M protein dimer is known, it is unclear how the viral M proteins interact with certain plasma membrane lipids to promote viral assembly. Here, we demonstrate that M proteins cluster at the plasma membrane by selectively binding with phosphatidylserine (PS). Our in vitro studies suggest that M binds PS lipid as dimers and M mutant with a phosphomimetic substitution inhibits interaction with PS lipids. The presence of other negatively charged lipids like PI(4, 5)P2 does not affect RSV M ability to bind, while cholesterol negatively affects M interaction with lipids. Moreover, we show that the initial binding of the RSV M protein with lipids is independent of the cytoplasmic tail of fusion (F) glycoprotein (FCT). It is the first in vitro study of M interaction with plasma membrane lipids. M binding to plasma membrane may represent a viable therapeutic strategy for small molecules that will block viral spread.",

Because of its unique composition and anti-inflammatory properties reported for both CTB and low doses of LPS from other Gram-negative bacteria, we speculated that WC-rBS might have anti-inflammatory potential in a chronic autoimmune disease such as inflammatory bowel diseases. First in vitro endotoxin tolerance experiments showed the surprising WC-rBS potential in the modulation of inflammatory responses on both PBMCs and THP1 cells. WC-rBS was further evaluated in the Dextran Sodium Sulfate colitis mouse model. Administrated orally at different dosages, WC-rBS vaccine was safe and showed immunomodulatory properties when administered in a preventive mode (before and during the induction of DSS colitis) as well as in a curative mode (after colitis induction); with improvement of disease activity index (from 27 to 73%) and histological score (from 65 to 88%). Interestingly, the highest therapeutic effect of WC-rBS vaccine was observed with the lowest dosage, showing even better anti-inflammatory properties than mesalamine; an approved 5-aminosalicylic acid drug for treating IBD patients. In summary, this is the first time that a prophylactic medicine, safe and approved for prevention of an infectious disease, showed a benefit in an inflammatory bowel disease model, potentially offering a novel therapeutic modality for IBD patients.",

In contrast, the frequent T1150A in NSD2 and its T2029A counterpart in NSD1, both observed in leukemia, are hyperactive and introduce up to H3K36me3 in biochemical and cellular assays, while wildtype NSD2 and NSD1 only generate up to H3K36me2. MD simulations with NSD2 revealed that H3K36me3 formation is possible due to an enlarged active site pocket of T1150A and loss of direct contacts of T1150 to critical residues which regulate the product specificity of NSD2. Bioinformatic analyses of published data suggest that the NSD2 T1150A mutation in lymphocytic leukemia could alter gene regulation by antagonizing H3K27me3 finally leading to the upregulation of oncogenes.",

    "abstract": "Post-translational modifications of histones are important regulators of the DNA damage response (DDR). By using affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) we discovered that genetic suppressor element 1 (GSE1) forms a complex with the HDAC1/CoREST deacetylase/demethylase co-repressor complex. In-depth phosphorylome analysis revealed that loss of GSE1 results in impaired DDR, ATR signalling and {gamma}H2AX formation upon DNA damage induction. Altered profiles of ATR target serine-glutamine motifs (SQ) on DDR-related hallmark proteins point to a defect in DNA damage sensing. In addition, GSE1 knock-out cells showed hampered DNA damage-induced phosphorylation on SQ motifs of regulators of histone post-translational modifications, suggesting altered histone modification. While loss of GSE1 does not affect the histone deacetylation activity of CoREST, GSE1 appears to be essential for binding of the deubiquitinase USP22 to CoREST and for the deubiquitination of H2B K120 in response to DNA damage. The combination of deacetylase, demethylase, and deubiquitinase activity makes the USP22-GSE1-CoREST subcomplex a multi enzymatic eraser that seems to play an important role during DDR.

    "abstract": "Cell motility is related to the higher-order structure of chromatin. Stimuli that induce cell migration change chromatin organization; such stimuli include elevated histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3). We previously showed that depletion of histone H3 lysine 9 methyltransferase, SUV39H1, suppresses directional cell migration. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this association between chromatin and cell migration remains elusive. The Golgi apparatus is a cell organelle essential for cell motility. In this study, we show that loss of H3K9 methyltransferase SUV39H1 but not SETDB1 or SETDB2 causes dispersion of the Golgi apparatus throughout the cytoplasm. The Golgi dispersion triggered by SUV39H1 depletion is independent of transcription, centrosomes, and microtubule organization, but is suppressed by depletion of any of the following three proteins: LINC complex components SUN2, nesprin-2, or microtubule plus-end-directed kinesin-like protein KIF20A. In addition, SUN2 is closely localized to H3K9me3, and SUV39H1 affects the mobility of SUN2 in the nuclear envelope. Further, inhibition of cell motility caused by SUV39H1 depletion is restored by suppression of SUN2, nesprin-2, or KIF20A. In summary, these results show the functional association between chromatin organization and cell motility via the Golgi organization regulated by the LINC complex.",

We successfully identified a single base pair duplication in the SLC33A1 gene, resulting in a frameshift leading to a premature stop codon (p.Arg246Alafs*3). SLC33A1 acts as a transmembrane transporter of acetyl-Coenzyme A, essential for cellular metabolism. In order to assess for the lethal phenotype in homozygous MTR sheep, we generated at-risk matings by artificial insemination (AI) between rams and ewes heterozygous for the SLC33A1 variant named SLC33A1_dupG. Gestation status was checked 15 days post-AI by a molecular test from blood expression of the interferon Tau-stimulated MX1 gene, and by ultrasonography performed between 45 days and 60 days post-AI. Based on ultrasonography, the AI success was reduced by 12% compared to safe matings suggesting embryonic/fetal losses further confirmed by the molecular test based on MX1 differential expression. Forty-nine lambs were born from at-risk matings with a mortality rate of 34.7% observed before weaning. Homozygous SLC33A1_dupG lambs contributed to 47% of this mortality occurring mainly in the first five days after lambing with no obvious clinical signs. Thus, an appropriate management of SLC33A1_dupG (allele frequency of 0.04) in the MTR selection scheme should increase the overall fertility and lamb survival.",

    "abstract": "The vertebrate hosts immune system and resident commensal bacteria deploy a range of highly reactive small molecules that provide a barrier against infections by microbial pathogens. Gut pathogens, such as Vibrio cholerae, sense and respond to these stressors by modulating the expression of exotoxins that are crucial for colonization. Here, we employ mass-spectrometry-based profiling, metabolomics, expression assays and biophysical approaches to show that transcriptional activation of the hemolysin gene hlyA in V. cholerae is regulated by intracellular reactive sulfur species (RSS), specifically sulfane sulfur. We first present a comprehensive sequence similarity network analysis of the arsenic repressor (ArsR) superfamily of transcriptional regulators where RSS and reactive oxygen species (ROS) sensors segregate into distinct clusters. We show that HlyU, transcriptional activator of hlyA in V. cholerae, belongs to the RSS-sensing cluster and readily reacts with organic persulfides, showing no reactivity and remaining DNA-bound following treatment with various ROS in vitro, including H2O2. Surprisingly, in V. cholerae cell cultures, both sulfide and peroxide treatment downregulate HlyU-dependent transcriptional activation of hlyA. However, RSS metabolite profiling shows that both sulfide and peroxide treatment raise the endogenous inorganic sulfide and disulfide levels to a similar extent, accounting for this crosstalk, and confirming that V. cholerae attenuates HlyU-mediated activation of hlyA in a specific response to intracellular RSS. These findings provide new evidence that gut pathogens may harness RSS-sensing as an evolutionary adaptation that allows them to overcome the gut inflammatory response by modulating the expression of exotoxins.",

    "abstract": "Acquired ribosomal RNA (rRNA) methylation has emerged as a significant mechanism of aminoglycoside resistance in pathogenic bacterial infections. Modification of a single nucleotide in the ribosome decoding center by the aminoglycoside-resistance 16S rRNA (m7G1405) methyltransferases effectively blocks the action of all 4,6-deoxystreptamine ring-containing aminoglycosides, including the latest generation of drugs. To define the molecular basis of 30S subunit recognition and G1405 modification by these enzymes, we used a S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) analog to trap the complex in a post-catalytic state to enable determination of an overall 3.0 [A] cryo-electron microscopy structure of the m7G1405 methyltransferase RmtC bound to the mature Escherichia coli 30S ribosomal subunit. This structure, together with functional analyses of RmtC variants, identifies the RmtC N-terminal domain as critical for recognition and docking of the enzyme on a conserved 16S rRNA tertiary surface adjacent to G1405 in 16S rRNA helix 44 (h44). To access the G1405 N7 position for modification, a collection of residues across one surface of RmtC, including a loop that undergoes a disorder to order transition upon 30S subunit binding, induces significant distortion of h44. This distortion flips G1405 into the enzyme active site where it is positioned for modification by two almost universally conserved RmtC residues. These studies expand our understanding of ribosome recognition by rRNA modification enzymes and present a more complete structural basis for future development of strategies to inhibit m7G1405 modification to re-sensitize bacterial pathogens to aminoglycosides.\n\nSignificanceIncreasing prevalence of bacterial antibiotic resistance threatens our ability to treat bacterial infections and with it, many other facets of modern healthcare. For the ribosome-targeting aminoglycoside antibiotics, diverse pathogenic bacteria have acquired ribosomal RNA (rRNA) methyltransferase enzymes that confer exceptionally high-level resistance through site-specific modification of the drug binding site. Here, we define the molecular basis for ribosomal substrate recognition and modification by an enzyme (RmtC) representing the most clinically prevalent methyltransferase family. Specifically, RmtC exploits a conserved rRNA surface for binding and induces significant disruption of the rRNA structure to capture the target nucleotide for modification via a \"base flipping\" mechanism. These insights also present a platform for methyltransferase inhibitor development to extend usefulness of aminoglycoside antibiotics.",
