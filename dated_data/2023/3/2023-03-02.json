    "abstract": "Although many studies have shown that microbes can ectopically stimulate or suppress plant immune responses, the fundamental question of whether the entire preexisting microbiota is indeed required for proper development of plant immune response remains unanswered. Using a recently developed peat-based gnotobiotic plant growth system we found that Arabidopsis grown in the absence of a natural microbiota lacked age-dependent maturation of plant immune response and were defective in several aspects of pattern-triggered immunity. Axenic plants exhibited hypersusceptibility to infection by the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 and the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Microbiota-mediated immunocompetence was suppressed by rich nutrient conditions, indicating a tripartite interaction between the host, microbiota, and abiotic environment. A synthetic microbiota composed of 48 culturable bacterial strains from the leaf endosphere of healthy Arabidopsis plants was able to substantially restore immunocompetence similar to plants inoculated with a soil-derived community. In contrast, a 52-member dysbiotic synthetic leaf microbiota overstimulated the immune transcriptome. Together, these results provide evidence for a causal role of a eubiotic microbiota in gating proper immunocompetence and age-dependent immunity in plants.",

    "abstract": "Response inhibition, defined as the ability to suppress inappropriate responses, is a key characteristic of adaptive human behaviour. However, in individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) it is often impaired and is linked to broad life outcomes. Previous neuroimaging investigations have indicated a myriad of brain networks in response inhibition, which limit its utility in understanding and overcoming response inhibition difficulties. More recently, it has been suggested that a specific fronto-parietal functional circuitry between the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), dictates the recruitment of the IPS in response inhibition in ADHD. To ascertain the critical role of the IFG-IPS functional circuit and its relevance to response inhibition in ADHD, it is crucial to understand the underlying structural architecture of this circuit so that the functional relevance could be interpreted correctly. Here we investigated the white matter pathways connecting the IFG and IPS using seed-based probabilistic tractography on diffusion data in 42 ADHD and 24 neurotypicals and assessed their impact on both the recruitment of IPS in response inhibition scenarios and on response inhibition performance in a Go/No-go task. Our results showed that individual differences in the structural properties of the IPS-IFG circuit, including tract volume and diffusivity, were linked to IPS activation and even predicted response inhibition performance outside the scanner. These findings highlight the structural-functional coupling of the IFG-IPS circuit in response inhibition in ADHD and confirm a structural basis for maladaptive functional top-down control in deficient inhibition in ADHD. Our results also support the notion of ADHD as a continuum and suggest that individual differences in tract-specific functional and structural connectivity could serve as neuromarkers of ADHD.",

    "abstract": "Excessive alcohol use causes a great deal of harm and negative health outcomes. Corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF), a stress-related neuropeptide, has been implicated in binge ethanol intake and ethanol dependence. CRF containing neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTCRF) can control ethanol consumption. These BNSTCRF neurons also release GABA, raising the question, is it CRF or GABA release or both that is controlling alcohol consumption. Here, we used viral vectors to separate the effects of CRF and GABA release from BNSTCRF neurons on the escalation of ethanol intake in an operant self-administration paradigm in male and female mice. We found that CRF deletion in BNST neurons reduces ethanol intake in both sexes, with a stronger effect in males. For sucrose self-administration there was no effect of CRF deletion. Suppression of GABA release, via knockdown of vGAT, from BNSTCRF produced a transient increase in ethanol operant self-administration following in male mice, and reduced in motivation to work for sucrose on a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement in a sex-dependent manner. Together, these results highlight how different signaling molecules from the same populations of neurons can bidirectionally control behavior. Moreover, they suggest that BNST CRF release is important for high intensity ethanol drinking that precedes dependence, whereas GABA release from these neurons may play a role in regulating motivation.",

    "abstract": "Dendritic cells (DCs) are key antigen presentation cells (APC) that bridge innate and adaptive immune functions to contain the pathogenic threats. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are implicated in functional regulation of various biological processes including inflammation and immunity. However, the knowledge on myeloid DC expressed lncRNA repertoire and their regulatory functions is limited. In this study, we have reconnoitered the time-kinetics of lncRNA expression profiles during monocyte-to-DC differentiation and their roles in shaping DC functions. Our RNA-seq data identified thousands of differentially expressed lncRNAs associated with primary human monocyte-to-DC differentiation in vitro. We selected two lncRNAs viz., AL109754.1 and AC093278.2 that were enriched during DC differentiation. Knockdown of AL109754.1 but not AC093278 affects DCs differentiation as observed by marked reduction of surface markers CD1a, CD93 and CD209. These DCs also exhibit significant reduction in the expression of TLR 2, 4, 5, 7 and 9, suggesting that AL109754.1 expression is critical in maintaining TLR expression in DCs. Furthermore, reduced phosphorylation of NF-{kappa}B, IRF3 and IRF7 in AL109754.1 knockdown DCs treated with TLR agonists further substantiate their role in potentiating TLR signaling. Mechanistically, AL109754.1 knockdown DC showed significant downregulation of multiple NF-{kappa}B-induced genes and time-dependent inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1{beta}, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF) secretion upon challenge with TLR 4, 5, or 7 agonists. Overall, this study characterized novel functions of AL109754.1 that regulates DC differentiation, and TLR-dependent innate immune activation.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy is an essential self-degradative and recycling mechanism that maintains cellular homeostasis. Estrogen receptor-related orphan receptors (ERRs) play fundamental role in regulation of cardiac metabolism and function. Previously, we showed that ERR agonists improve cardiac function in models of heart failure and induce autophagy in cardiomyocytes. Here, we characterized a mechanism by which ERRs induce autophagy in cardiomyocytes. Transcription factor EB (TFEB) is a master regulator of the autophagy-lysosome pathway and has been shown to be important in cardiac autophagy. We discovered that TFEB is a direct ERR target gene whose expression is induced by ERR agonists. Activation of ERR results in increased TFEB expression in both neonatal rat ventricular myocytes and C2C12 myoblasts. ERR-dependent increases in TFEB expression results in increased expression of an array of TFEB target genes, which are critical for stimulation of autophagy. Pharmacologically targeting ERR is a promising potential method for treatment of many diseases where stimulation of autophagy may be therapeutic including heart failure.",

    "abstract": "The cell proliferation-quiescence decision plays fundamental roles in tissue formation and regeneration, and its dysregulation can lead to human diseases. In this study, we performed transcriptomics and genetic analyses using a zebrafish model to identify pathways and genes involved in epithelial cell quiescence-proliferation regulation. In this in vivo model, a population of GFP-labeled epithelial cells known as ionocytes were induced to reenter the cell cycle by a physiological stress. Transcriptomics analysis identified 1168 genes up-regulated and 996 genes down-regulated in the reactivated cells. GO and KEGG pathway analyses revealed that genes involved in transcription regulation, cell cycle, Foxo signaling, and Wnt signaling pathway are enriched among the up-regulated genes, while those involved in ion transport, cell adhesion, and oxidation-reduction are enriched among the down-regulated genes. Among the top up-regulated genes is FK506 binding protein 5 (Fkbp5), a member of the conserved immunophilin family. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Fkbp5 deletion abolished ionocyte reactivation and proliferation.\n\nPharmacological inhibition of Fkbp5 had similar effects. Further analyses showed that genetic deletion and inhibition of Fkbp5 impaired Akt signaling. Forced expression of a constitutively active form of Akt rescued the defects caused by Fkbp5 inhibition. These results uncover a previously unrecognized role of Fbkp5 in regulating the quiescence-proliferation decision via Akt signaling.\n\nImpact StatementTranscriptomic and genetic deletion studies unravel a new role of Fkbp5 in promoting cell reactivation via Akt signaling.\n\nHighlightsO_LITranscriptomic analysis reveals several molecular pathways altered during epithelial cell quiescence-proliferation transition.\nC_LIO_LIFkbp5 is highly up-regulated in reactivated and dividing cells.\nC_LIO_LIFkbp5 promotes epithelial cell reactivation and proliferation via Akt signaling.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Expression from transfected plasmid DNA is generally transient, but little do we know on what limits this. Live-cell imaging revealed that DNA transfected into mammalian cells was either captured directly in the cytoplasm, or was soon expelled from the nucleus, upon its entry. In the cytoplasm, plasmid DNA was rapidly surrounded by a double membrane and frequently colocalized with extra-chromosomal DNA of telomeric origin, also expelled from the nucleus. Therefore, we termed this long-term maintained structure exclusome. The exclusome envelope contains endoplasmic reticulum proteins, the inner-nuclear membrane proteins Lap2{beta} and Emerin but differs from the nuclear envelope by the absence of the Lamin B Receptor, nuclear pore complexes and by the presence of fenestrations. Further, Emerin affects the frequency of cells with exclusomes. Thus, cells wrap chromosomes and extra-chromosomal DNA into similar yet distinct envelopes. Thereby, they distinguish, sort, cluster, package, and keep extra-chromosomal DNA in the exclusome but chromosomal DNA in the nucleus, where transcription occurs.",

    "abstract": "Iodidimonas is a genus recently described in bioreactors treating oil and gas produced water and in iodide rich brines. Besides the ability to oxidize iodine, little is known about the metabolic capabilities that enable Iodidimonas sp. to occupy this unique ecological niche. We isolated, characterized, and sequenced three strains belonging to the Iodidimonas genus from the sludge of a membrane bioreactor treating produced water. We describe the genomic features of these isolates and compare them with the only other four isolate genomes reported from this genus, as well as a metagenome-assembled genome from the source bioreactor. To survive in the produced water, Iodidimonas isolates had several genes associated with mitigating salinity, heavy metal and organic compound stress. While the isolates could utilize a wide variety of carbon substrates, they failed to degrade aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons, consistent with the lack of genes associated with common hydrocarbon degradation pathways in their genomes. We hypothesize these microbes may lead a scavenging lifestyle in the bioreactor and similar iodide-rich brines.\n\nImportanceOccupying a niche habitat and having few representative isolates, genus Iodidimonas is a relatively understudied Alphaproteobacterial group. This genus has garnered attention due to its ability to corrode pipes in iodine production facilities and generate iodinated organic compounds during treatment of oil and gas produced water. The iodinated organic compounds are likely to be carcinogenic and may pose issues with recycling the treated water. Hence, detailed characterization of the metabolic potential of these isolates is not only of economic importance, but also sheds light on adaptation of this microbe to its environmental niche.",

    "abstract": "Despite the grand advances in fluorescence microscopy, the photon budget of fluorescent molecules remains the fundamental limiting factor for major imaging parameters, such as temporal resolution, duration, contrast, and even spatial resolution. Computational methods can strategically utilize the fluorescence photons against the imaging noise, to break the abovementioned limits. Here, we propose a multi-resolution analysis (MRA) approach to recharacterize and extract the two main characteristics of fluorescence images: (1) high contrast across the edge, and (2) high continuity along the edge. By regularizing the solution using framelet and curvelet domain sparsity, we develop MRA deconvolution algorithm for fluorescence image, which allows fine detail recovery even with negative signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), and can provide more than 2-fold physical resolution enhancement with conspicuously fewer artifacts than maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) methods. Furthermore, we develop DeepMRA deconvolution algorithm that can provide computational background inhibition through a bias thresholding mechanism while deconvolving a fluorescence image. Compared with conventional background mitigation schemes, this novel deconvolution canonical form can deal with severer background and better preserve the high-frequency and low-intensity details, which are commonly disrupted by other algorithms. We demonstrate that the MRA and DeepMRA deconvolution algorithms can improve the SNR and resolution of biological images in various microscopies, such as wide-field, confocal, spinning-disk confocal (SD-confocal), light-sheet, structured illumination microscopy (SIM), and stimulated excitation depletion (STED) microscopy.",

    "abstract": "LipoPolySaccharides are a hallmark of Gram-negative bacteria and their presence at the cell surface is key for bacterial integrity. As surface exposed components, they are recognized by immunity C-type lectin receptors present on Antigen Presenting Cells. Human Macrophage Galactose Lectin binds E. coli surface that presents a specific glycan motif. Nevertheless, this high affinity interaction occurs regardless of the integrity of its canonical calcium-dependent glycan binding site. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance of MGL carbohydrate recognition domain and complete extracellular domain revealed a new glycan binding site opposite to the canonical site. A model of trimeric Macrophage Galactose Lectin was determined based on a combination of Small Angle X-ray scattering and Alphafold. A disulphide bond positions the Carbohydrate Recognition Domain perpendicular to the coiled-coil domain. This unique configuration for a C-type lectin orients the six glycan sites of MGL in an ideal position to bind LipoPolySaccharides at the bacterial surface with high avidity.",

    "abstract": "Understanding vascular adaptation, namely what drives veins to shrink or grow, is key for the self-organization of flow networks and their optimization. From the top-down principle of minimizing flow dissipation at a fixed metabolic cost within flow networks, flow shear rate resulting from the flows pervading veins is hypothesized to drive vein adaptation. Yet, there is no bottom-up derivation of how flow forces impact vein dynamics. From the physical principle of force balance, shear rate acts parallel to vein walls, and hence, naively shear rate could only stretch veins and not dilate or shrink them. We, here, resolve this paradox by theoretically investigating force balance on a vein wall in the context of the vascular network of the model organism P. polycephalum. We propose, based on previous mechanical studies of cross-linked gels, that shear induces a nonlinear, anisotropic response of the actomyosin gel, making up vein walls that can indeed drive vein dilatation. Furthermore, our force balance approach allows us to identify that shear feedback occurs with a typical timescale and with a typical target shear rate that are not universal properties of the material but instead depend smoothly on the location of the vein within the network. In particular, the target shear rate is related to the veins hydrostatic pressure, which highlights the role of pressure in vascular adaptation. Finally, since our derivation is based on force balance and fluid mechanics, we believe our approach can be extended to vascular adaptation in other organisms.",

    "abstract": "Tumor-angiogenesis and -immunity play critical roles in cancer progression and outcome. An inverse correlation of these two1 hints at common regulatory mechanism(s). Here, we report that Zbtb46, a repressive transcription factor and a widely accepted marker for classical dendritic cells (DCs)2, 3, constitutes one such regulatory mechanism. Zbtb46 was downregulated in both DCs and endothelial cells (ECs) by tumor-derived factors to facilitate robust tumor growth. Zbtb46 downregulation led to a hallmark pro-tumor microenvironment (TME), including dysfunctional vasculature and immunosuppressive cell accumulation. Analysis of cancer patient data revealed a similar association of low ZBTB46 expression with an immunosuppressive TME and a worse prognosis. In contrast, enforced Zbtb46 expression mitigated the pro-tumor TME features and restricted tumor growth. Mechanistically, Zbtb46-deficient ECs were highly angiogenic, and Zbtb46-deficient bone-marrow progenitors upregulated Cebpb and diverted the DC program to myeloid lineage output, potentially explaining the myeloid lineage skewing phenomenon in cancer4-7. Conversely, enforced Zbtb46 expression normalized tumor vessels and, by suppressing Cebpb, skewed bone-marrow precursors towards more DC generation over macrophages, leading to an immune-hot TME. Remarkably, Zbtb46 mRNA treatment synergized with anti-PD1 immunotherapy to improve tumor management in pre-clinical models. These findings identify Zbtb46 as a common regulatory mechanism for angiogenesis and for myeloid lineage skewing in cancer and suggest that maintaining its expression could have therapeutic benefits.",

An incidental finding from prior work on paracrine communication between malignant PDAC cells and fibroblasts revealed that inhibition of the Hedgehog (HH) pathway partially relieved angiosuppression, increasing tumor vascularity through unknown mechanisms. Initial efforts to study this phenotype were hindered by difficulties replicating the complex interactions of multiple cell types in vitro. Here we identify a cascade of paracrine signals between multiple cell types that act sequentially to suppress angiogenesis in PDAC. Malignant epithelial cells promote HH signaling in fibroblasts, leading to inhibition of WNT signaling in fibroblasts and epithelial cells, thereby limiting VEGFR2-dependent activation of endothelial hypersprouting. This cascade was elucidated using human and murine PDAC explant models, which effectively retain the complex cellular interactions of native tumor tissues.",

    "abstract": "The Drosophila Dpr and DIP proteins belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface proteins (CSPs). Their hetero- and homophilic interactions have been implicated in a variety of neuronal functions, including synaptic connectivity, cell survival, and axon fasciculation. However, the signaling pathways underlying these diverse functions are unknown. To gain insight into Dpr-DIP signaling, we sought to examine how these CSPs are associated with the membrane. Specifically, we asked whether Dprs and DIPs are integral membrane proteins or membrane anchored through the addition of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) linkage. We demonstrate that Dprs and DIPs are GPI anchored to the membrane of insect cells and validate these findings for some family members in vivo using Drosophila larvae, where GPI anchor cleavage results in loss of surface labeling. Additionally, we show that GPI cleavage abrogates aggregation of insect cells expressing cognate Dpr-DIP partners. To test if the GPI anchor affects Dpr-DIP localization, we replaced it with a transmembrane domain and observed perturbation of sub-cellular localization on motor neurons and muscles. These data suggest that membrane anchoring of Dprs and DIPs through GPI linkage is required for localization and that Dpr-DIP intracellular signaling likely requires transmembrane co-receptors.",

    "abstract": "Behavior is often dichotomized into model-free and model-based systems 1, 2. Model-free behavior prioritizes associations that have high value, regardless of the specific consequence or circumstance. In contrast, model-based behavior involves considering all possible outcomes to produce behavior that best fits the current circumstance. We typically exhibit a mixture of these behaviors so we can trade-off efficiency and flexibility. However, substance use disorder shifts behavior more strongly towards model-free systems, which produces a difficulty abstaining from drug-seeking due to an inability to withhold making the model-free high-value response 3-10. The lateral hypothalamus (LH) is implicated in substance use disorder 11-17 and we have demonstrated that this region is critical to Pavlovian cue-reward learning 18, 19. However, it is unknown whether learning occurring in LH is model-free or model-based, where the necessary teaching signal comes from to facilitate learning in LH, and whether this is relevant for learning deficits that drive substance use disorder. Here, we reveal that learning occurring in the LH is model-based. Further, we confirm the existence of an understudied projection extending from dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the LH and demonstrate that this input underlies model-based learning in LH. Finally, we examine the impact of methamphetamine self-administration on LH-dependent model-based processes. These experiments reveal that a history of methamphetamine administration enhances the model-based control that Pavlovian cues have over decision-making, which was accompanied by a bidirectional strengthening of the LH to VTA circuit. Together, this work reveals a novel bidirectional circuit that underlies model-based learning and is relevant to the behavioral and cognitive changes that arise with substance use disorders. This circuit represents a new addition to models of addiction, which focus on instrumental components of drug addiction and increases in model-free habits after drug exposure 3-10.",

Tuft cells are key regulators of type 2 immunity, however the factors that control these cells remain poorly understood. Here we find that butyrate-producing commensal bacteria decrease tuft cells in the intestine. Butyrate suppression of tuft cells required the epigenetic modifying enzyme histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), suggesting that HDAC3 may promote tuft cell-dependent immunity. Consistent with this, epithelial-intrinsic HDAC3 actively regulated tuft cell expansion in vivo and was required to induce type 2 immune responses during helminth infection. Interestingly, butyrate epigenetically restricted stem cell differentiation into tuft cells, and inhibition of HDAC3 in adult mice and human intestinal organoids was sufficient to block tuft cell expansion. Collectively, these data reveal an epigenetic pathway in stem cells that directs tuft cell differentiation, and highlight a new level of regulation through which commensal bacteria calibrate intestinal immunity.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has posed a significant challenge in developing broadly neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) with guaranteed therapeutic potential. Some nAbs, such as Sotrovimab, have exhibited varying levels of efficacy against different variants, while others, such as Bebtelovimab and Bamlanivimab-etesevimab are ineffective against specific variants, including BQ.1.1 and XBB. This highlights the urgent need for developing broadly active mAbs providing prophylactic and therapeutic benefits to high-risk patients, especially in the face of the risk of reinfection from new variants. Here, we aimed to investigate the feasibility of redirecting existing mAbs against new variants of SARS-CoV-2, as well as to understand how BQ.1.1 and XBB.1.5 can evade broadly neutralizing mAbs. By mapping epitopes and escape sites, we discovered that the new variants evade multiple mAbs, including FDA-approved Bebtelovimab, which showed resilience against other Omicron variants. Our approach, which included simulations, free energy perturbations, and shape complementarity analysis, revealed the possibility of identifying mAbs that are effective against both BQ.1.1 and XBB.1.5. We identified two broad-spectrum mAbs, R200-1F9 and R207-2F11, as potential candidates with increased binding affinity to XBB.1.5 and BQ.1.1 compared to the wild-type virus. Additionally, we propose that these mAbs do not interfere with ACE2 and bind to conserved epitopes on the RBD that are not-overlapping, potentially providing a solution to neutralize these new variants either independently or as part of a combination (cocktail) treatment.",

    "abstract": "Direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) is important in anaerobic communities of environmental and practical significance. Other than the need for close physical contact for electrical connections, the interactions of DIET partners are poorly understood. Type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) typically kill competitive microbes. Surprisingly, Geobacter metallireducens highly expressed T6SS genes when DIET-based co-cultures were initiated with Geobacter sulfurreducens. T6SS gene expression was lower when the electron shuttle anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate was added to alleviate the need for interspecies contact. Disruption of hcp, the G. metallireducens gene for the main T6SS needle-tube protein subunit, and the most highly upregulated gene in DIET-grown cells, eliminated the long lag periods required for the initiation of DIET. The mutation did not aid DIET in the presence of granular activated carbon, consistent with the fact that DIET partners do not make physical contact when electrically connected through conductive materials. The hcp-deficient mutant also established DIET quicker with Methanosarcina barkeri. However, the mutant also reduced Fe(III) oxide faster than the wild-type strain, a phenotype not expected from the loss of the T6SS. Quantitative PCR revealed greater gene transcript abundance for key components of extracellular electron transfer in the hcp-deficient mutant versus the wild-type strain, potentially accounting for the faster Fe(III) oxide reduction and impact on DIET. The results highlight that interspecies interactions beyond electrical connections may influence DIET effectiveness. The unexpected increase in the expression of genes for extracellular electron transport components when hcp was deleted emphasize the complexities in evaluating the electromicrobiology of highly adaptable Geobacter species.\n\nIMPORTANCEDirect interspecies electron transfer (DIET) is an alternative to the much more intensively studied process of interspecies H2 transfer as a mechanism for microbes to share electrons during the cooperative metabolism of energy sources. DIET is an important process in anaerobic soils and sediments generating methane, a significant greenhouse gas. Facilitating DIET can accelerate and stabilize the conversion of organic wastes to methane biofuel in anaerobic digesters. Therefore, a better understanding of the factors controlling how fast DIET partnerships are established is expected to lead to new strategies for promoting this bioenergy process. The finding that when co-cultured with G. sulfurreducens, G. metallireducens initially expressed a type VI secretion system, a behavior not conducive to interspecies cooperation, illustrates the complexity in establishing syntrophic relationships.",

    "abstract": "The demand for novel antimicrobial compounds is rapidly growing due to the rising appearance of antibiotic resistance in bacteria; accordingly, alternative approaches are urgently needed. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are promising since they are a naturally occurring part of the innate immune system and display remarkable broad-spectrum activity and high selectivity against various microbes. Marine invertebrates are a primary resource of natural AMPs. Consequently, cDNA expression (EST) libraries from the Cnidarian moon jellyfish Aurelia aurita and the Ctenophore comb jelly Mnemiopsis leidyi were constructed in Escherichia coli. Cell-free size-fractionated cell extracts (< 3 kDa) of the two libraries (each with 29,952 clones) were consecutively screened for peptides preventing the biofilm formation of opportunistic pathogens using the crystal violet assay. The 3 kDa fraction of ten individual clones demonstrated promising biofilm-preventing activities against Klebsiella oxytoca and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Sequencing the respective activity-conferring inserts allowed the identification of small ORFs encoding peptides (10 - 22 aa), which were subsequently chemically synthesized to validate their inhibitory potential. Biofilm-preventing effects against K. oxytoca, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. epidermidis, and S. aureus were verified for five synthetic peptides in a concentration-dependent manner, with peptide BiP_Aa_5 showing the strongest effects. The impact of BiP_Aa_2, BiP_Aa_5, and BiP_Aa_6 on dynamic biofilm formation of K. oxytoca was further validated in microfluidic flow cells, demonstrating a significant reduction in biofilm thickness and volume by BiP_Aa_2 and BiP_Aa_5. Overall, the structural characteristics of the marine invertebrate-derived AMPs, their physicochemical properties, and promising anti-biofilm effects highlight them as attractive candidates for discovering new antimicrobials.",

    "abstract": "Drugs that target the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 are effective therapeutics that have entered clinical use. Wide-scale use of these drugs will apply selection pressure for the evolution of resistance mutations. To understand resistance potential in Mpro, we performed comprehensive surveys of amino acid changes that can cause resistance in a yeast screen to nirmatrelvir (contained in the drug Paxlovid), and ensitrelvir (Xocova) that is currently in phase III trials. The most impactful resistance mutation (E166V) recently reported in multiple viral passaging studies with nirmatrelvir showed the strongest drug resistance score for nirmatrelvir, while P168R had the strongest resistance score for ensitrelvir. Using a systematic approach to assess potential drug resistance, we identified 142 resistance mutations for nirmatrelvir and 177 for ensitrelvir. Among these mutations, 99 caused apparent resistance to both inhibitors, suggesting a strong likelihood for the evolution of cross-resistance. Many mutations that exhibited inhibitor-specific resistance were consistent with distinct ways that each inhibitor protrudes beyond the substrate envelope. In addition, mutations with strong drug resistance scores tended to have reduced function. Our results indicate that strong pressure from nirmatrelvir or ensitrelvir will select for multiple distinct resistant lineages that will include both primary resistance mutations that weaken interactions with drug while decreasing enzyme function and secondary mutations that increase enzyme activity. The comprehensive identification of resistance mutations enables the design of inhibitors with reduced potential of developing resistance and aids in the surveillance of drug resistance in circulating viral populations.",

    "abstract": "In comparisons between mutant and wild-type genotypes, transcriptome analysis can reveal the direct impacts of a mutation, together with the homeostatic responses of the biological system. Recent studies have highlighted that, when homozygous mutations are studied in non-isogenic backgrounds, genes from the same chromosome as a mutation often appear over-represented among differentially expressed (DE) genes. One hypothesis suggests that DE genes chromosomally linked to a mutation may not reflect true biological responses to the mutation but, instead, result from differences in representation of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) between sample groups selected on the basis of mutant or wild-type genotype. This is problematic when inclusion of spurious DE genes in a functional enrichment study results in incorrect inferences of mutation effect. Here we show that chromosomally co-located differentially expressed genes (CC-DEGs) can also be observed in analyses of dominant mutations in heterozygotes. We define a method and a metric to quantify, in RNA-sequencing data, localised differential allelic representation (DAR) between groups of samples subject to differential expression analysis. We show how the DAR metric can predict regions prone to eQTL-driven differential expression, and how it can improve functional enrichment analyses through gene exclusion or weighting of gene-level rankings. Advantageously, this improved ability to identify probable eQTLs also reveals examples of CC-DEGs that are likely to be functionally related to a mutant phenotype. This supports a long-standing prediction that selection for advantageous linkage disequilibrium influences chromosome evolution. By comparing the genomes of zebrafish (Danio rerio) and medaka (Oryzias latipes), a teleost with a conserved ancestral karyotype, we find possible examples of chromosomal aggregation of CC-DEGs during evolution of the zebrafish lineage. The DAR metric provides a solid foundation for addressing the eQTL issue in new and existing datasets because it relies solely on RNA-sequencing data.",

    "abstract": "While the external signs of skin aging have been well-defined throughout history, much less is known about aging within the ultrastructure of our skin. Our skin, the largest organ in our body, is structured by collagen through fibrils or large sheets. With the increased use of nanometrology tools in histology, it is now possible to explore how the aging process affects collagen at its most fundamental level, the collagen fibril. Here, we show how atomic force microscopy-based quantitative nanohistology can differentiate skin from different age groups and anatomical sites. Following the definition of specific collagen biomarkers at the nanoscale, we used a segmentation approach to quantify the prevalence of 4 structural biomarkers over a dataset of 42,000 images (30 donors) complemented by extensive nanomechanical analyses (30,000 indentation curves) on histological sections. Our results demonstrate that specific age-related collagen fingerprints could be found when comparing the % prevalence of each marker between the papillary and reticular dermis. A case of abnormal biological aging validated our markers and nanohistology approach. This first extensive study focusing on defining signs of dermal aging at the nanoscale proves we are all unique to our dermal collagen ultrastructure.",

    "abstract": "The maturation and stabilization of appropriate synaptic connections is a vital step in the development of neuronal circuits, however the molecular signals underlying these processes are not fully understood. We show that astrocytes, through production of glypican 5 (GPC5), are required for maturation and refinement of synapses in the developing mouse cortex. In the absence of astrocyte GPC5 thalamocortical synapses in the visual cortex show structural immaturity during the critical period, including smaller presynaptic terminals, decreased postsynaptic density area, and presence of more postsynaptic partners at multisynaptic connections. This structural immaturity is accompanied by a delay in developmental incorporation of GLUA2-containing calcium impermeable AMPARs at intracortical synapses. The functional impact of this is that mice lacking astrocyte GPC5 exhibit increased levels of ocular dominance plasticity in adulthood. This shows astrocyte GPC5 is necessary for maturation and stabilization of synaptic connections in typical development, with implications for understanding disorders with altered synaptic function, including Alzheimers disease, where GPC5 levels are altered.",

    "abstract": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a beta herpesvirus that causes severe congenital birth defects including microcephaly, vision loss, and hearing loss. Infection of cerebral organoids with HCMV causes significant downregulation of genes involved in critical neurodevelopmental pathways. The precise features of the infection causing this dysregulation remain unknown. Entry of HCMV into human cells is determined by the composition of glycoproteins in viral particles, which is influenced by the source of the virus. This includes a trimer complex and a pentamer complex with the latter enriched from replication in epithelial cells. To begin dissecting which features contribute to neuronal pathogenesis, we evaluated infection using virus from different sources along with the distribution of cellular entry receptors on cells in cerebral organoids. We observed significant increases in the number of viral genomes, viral spread and penetrance, and multinucleated syncytia in neural tissues infected with HCMV propagated in epithelial cells compared to fibroblasts. To determine if this was related to entry receptor distribution, we measured expressions of cellular entry receptors and observed similar distributions of all receptors on cells obtained from organoids indicating that source of virus is likely the key determinant. Next, we asked whether we could limit pathogenesis using neutralization antibodies. We found that pre-treatment with antibodies against viral glycoprotein B (gB) and gH successfully decreased viral genome levels, viral gene expression, and virus-induced syncytia. In contrast, targeting specific cellular entry receptors failed to limit infection. Using an antibody against gB, we also observed partial protection of developmental gene expression that was further improved by the addition of brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF). These studies indicate that source of HCMV is a key determinant of neuronal pathogenesis that can be limited by neutralization antibodies and neurotropic factors.",

    "abstract": "Biologically precise enhancer licensing by lineage-determining transcription factors enables activation of transcripts appropriate to biological demand and prevents deleterious gene activation. This essential process is challenged by the millions of matches to most transcription factor binding motifs present in many eukaryotic genomes, leading to questions about how transcription factors achieve the exquisite specificity required. The importance of chromatin remodeling factors to enhancer activation is highlighted by their frequent mutation in developmental disorders and in cancer. Here we determine the roles of CHD4 to enhancer licensing and maintenance in breast cancer cells and during cellular reprogramming. In unchallenged basal breast cancer cells, CHD4 modulates chromatin accessibility at transcription factor binding sites; its depletion leads to altered motif scanning and redistribution of transcription factors to sites not previously occupied. During GATA3-mediated cellular reprogramming, CHD4 activity is necessary to prevent inappropriate chromatin opening and enhancer licensing. Mechanistically, CHD4 competes with transcription factor-DNA interaction by promoting nucleosome positioning over binding motifs. We propose that CHD4 acts as a chromatin proof-reading enzyme that prevents inappropriate gene expression by editing binding site selection by transcription factors.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAccumulating evidence suggests prenatal air pollution exposure alters DNA methylation (DNAm), which could go on to affect long-term health. However, it remains unclear whether prenatal DNAm alterations persist through early life. Identifying DNAm changes that persist from birth into childhood would provide greater insight into the molecular mechanisms that most likely contribute to the association of prenatal air pollution exposure with health outcomes such as atopic disease.\n\nObjectivesThis study investigated the persistence of DNAm changes associated with prenatal NO2 exposure (a surrogate measure of traffic-related air pollution) at age one to begin characterizing which DNAm changes most likely to contribute to atopic disease.\n\nMethodsWe used an atopy-enriched subset of CHILD study participants (N=145) to identify individual and regional cord blood DNAm differences associated with prenatal NO2, followed by an investigation of persistence in age one peripheral blood. As we had repeated DNAm measures, we also isolated postnatal-specific DNAm changes and examined their association with NO2 exposure in the first year of life. MANOVA tests were used to examine the association between DNAm changes associated with NO2 and child wheeze and atopy.\n\nResultsWe identified 24 regions of altered cord blood DNAm, with several annotated to HOX genes. Two regions annotated to MPDU1 and C5orf63 were significantly associated with age one wheeze. Further, we found the effect of prenatal NO2 exposure across CpGs within all altered regions remained similar at age one. A single region of postnatal-specific DNAm annotated to HOXB6 was associated with year one NO2 and age one atopy.\n\nDiscussionRegional cord blood DNAm changes associated with prenatal NO2 exposure persist through at least the first year of life, and some of these changes are associated with age one wheeze. The early-postnatal period remains a sensitive window to DNAm perturbations that may also influence child health.",

    "abstract": "Proprioception plays a crucial role in laryngeal function. Further, dysfunctional proprioception likely contributes to disorders such as laryngeal dystonia, dysphagia and vocal fold paresis. Despite this, the physiology of laryngeal proprioception is not well-understood. Controversy remains over whether canonical proprioceptive organs, like muscle spindles (MS) even exist in the intrinsic laryngeal muscles (ILM). Vesicular Glutamate Transporter 1 (VGLUT1) expression has been described in the sensory afferents of MS. This studys primary aim is to determine whether the ILM contain MS using VGLUT1. This is a novel approach, as prior studies have relied on morphology and myosin composition to study this question. Secondarily, we describe the pattern of VGLUT1 expression in the rat larynx, Larynges of 62 Sprague-Dawley rats distributed across 5 age groups (P3, P8, P11, P14-15, and adult), were sectioned and immunostained for VGLUT1 and beta-tubulin III. Other markers (S46, GNAT3, PLC{beta}2, S100b, CGRP) were used to further characterize identified afferent innervation. Of 62 rats, MS were identified in the lateral thyroarytenoid muscles of just three P8 rats, and no golgi tendon organs (GTO) were seen. VGLUT1-positive intramuscular receptor-like entities were observed ILM, and VGLUT1-positive nerve endings were observed in the laryngeal mucosa, concentrated around the arytenoid cartilage. Employing VGLUT1 immunostaining, this study shows that rat intrinsic laryngeal muscles rarely express MS and do not express GTO. This leaves open the possibility that the larynx exhibits a unique proprioceptive apparatus. VGLUT1-positive intramuscular and mucosal structures provide candidates for an alternative system. Further defining the role of these sensory organs will increase our understanding of vocal fold function and ultimately lead to better treatment of vocal fold disorders.\n\nKEY POINTSO_LIDysfunctional laryngeal proprioception likely contributes to disorders such as laryngeal dystonia, dysphagia, and vocal fold paresis. Unlike proprioception of skeletal muscles, proprioception of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles is poorly understood.\nC_LIO_LIIn the present study we demonstrate that canonical proprioceptive organs (muscles spindles and Golgi tendon organs) are rarely expressed in the rat larynx, by studying the expression pattern of VGLUT1.\nC_LIO_LIWe also demonstrate the presence of other sensory innervation and structures which may contribute to an alternative proprioceptive circuitry, which requires further study.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Studies on the function of Methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) and the consequence of MECP2 deficiency and duplication have largely focused on neurons. The function of MECP2 in human glia, along with the comprehensive understanding of glial function in neurodevelopmental disorders, is much less understood. Using female and male human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines to model MECP2 loss-of-function (LOF) in Rett Syndrome (RTT) in the developing brain, we investigated the molecular underpinnings of astrocyte (AST) development and dysfunction, and the mechanisms by which AST contribute to neuronal activity. Here we show that hESC-derived RTT ASTs have fewer mitochondria yet similar levels of reactive oxygen species compared to isogenic controls (CTR). We identified significantly diminished mitochondrial respiration that was compensated by increased glycolysis, and that the molecular mechanism behind mitochondrial dysfunction were reduced key proteins around the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and electron transport chain (ETC). We found an increased abundance of cytosolic amino acids in RTT ASTs under basal conditions that was readily depleted when energy demands were increased. We determined that RTT AST can donate their mitochondria to hESC-derived cortical neurons, and that isolated mitochondria from RTT ASTs are sufficient to cause significant changes to neuronal activity, increasing local field potentials to a hyperexcitable state. To examine mitochondrial health in the developing brain, we derived cerebral organoids. Ultrastructural analysis indicated that mitochondria from RTT hESC-derived organoids were significantly smaller compared to mitochondria from CTR organoids, indicating decreased connectivity and function, and this phenotype was stronger in glia compared to neurons. Using a multiomics epigenetics approach, we found hallmarks of RTT developmental delay and glial specific gene expression changes that corroborate altered energy metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction. Based on these results, we propose that release of dysfunctional mitochondria from RTT ASTs to neurons furthers pathophysiology of the syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophages are becoming increasingly important in the race to find alternatives to antibiotics. Unfortunately, bacteriophages that might otherwise be useful are sometimes discarded due to low titers making them unsuitable for downstream applications. Here, we present two distinct approaches to experimentally evolve novel New Zealand Paenibacillus larvae bacteriophages. The first approach uses the traditional agar-overlay method, whereas the other was a Rapid Appelmans Protocol (RAP) modelled after the established Appelmans Method. Both approaches resulted in an increase in plaque-forming units (PFU/mL). The RAP approach was significantly faster and simpler, and allowed us to evolve a set of bacteriophages in as little as four days, increasing titers 100-1000-fold relative to their ancestors. The resultant titers were sufficient to extract and sequence DNA from these bacteriophages. An analysis of these phage genomes is provided. We also propose a model that describes the parameters that allow the RAP approach to select improvement of bacteriophage titer. The RAP approach is an effective method for experimentally evolving previously intractable bacteriophages in a high-throughput and expeditious manner.",

However, it remains unclear why and how chunks contribute to motor execution. To analyze the structure of naturally occurring chunks, we trained mice to run in a complex series of steps and identified the formation of chunks. We found that intervals (cycle) and the positional relationship between the left and right limbs (phase) of steps inside the chunks, unlike those outside the chunks, were consistent across occurrences. Further, licking by the mice was also more periodic and linked to the specific phases of limb movements within the chunk. Based on these findings, we propose the rhythm chunking hypothesis, whereby within chunks, the repetitive movements of many body parts are linked by the rhythm parameters: cycle and phase. The computational complexity of movement may thereby be reduced by adjusting movements as the combination of rhythms.",

    "abstract": "Myelination by oligodendrocytes is critical for fast axonal conduction and for the support and survival of neurons in the central nervous system. Recent studies have emphasized that myelination is plastic and that new myelin is formed throughout life. Nonetheless, the mechanisms that regulate the number, length, and location of myelin sheaths formed by individual oligodendrocytes are incompletely understood. Previous work showed that lysosomal transcription factor TFEB represses myelination by oligodendrocytes and that the RagA GTPase inhibits TFEB, but the step or steps of myelination in which TFEB plays a role have remained unclear. Here, we show that TFEB regulates oligodendrocyte differentiation and also controls the number and length of myelin sheaths formed by individual oligodendrocytes. In the dorsal spinal cord of tfeb mutants, individual oligodendrocytes produce fewer myelin sheaths, and these sheaths are longer than those produced by wildtype cells. Transmission electron microscopy shows that there are more myelinated axons in the dorsal spinal cord of tfeb mutants than in wildtype animals, but no significant change in axon diameter. In contrast to tfeb mutants, oligodendrocytes in rraga mutants produce shorter myelin sheaths. The sheath length in rraga; tfeb double mutants is not significantly different from wildtype, consistent with the antagonistic interaction between RagA and TFEB. Finally, we find that the GTPase activating protein Flcn and the RagCa and RagCb GTPases are also necessary for myelination by oligodendrocytes. These findings demonstrate that TFEB coordinates myelin sheath length and number during myelin formation in the central nervous system.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/530892v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (53K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ed69a7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b35577org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b0389dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@54e3e0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",
