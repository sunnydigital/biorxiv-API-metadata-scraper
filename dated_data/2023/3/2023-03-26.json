    "abstract": "Improper regulation of translation initiation, a vital checkpoint of protein synthesis in the cell, has been linked to a number of cancers. Overexpression of protein subunits of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) is associated with increased translation of mRNAs involved in cell proliferation. In addition to playing a major role in general translation initiation by serving as a scaffold for the assembly of translation initiation complexes, eIF3 regulates translation of specific cellular mRNAs and viral RNAs. Mutations in the N-terminal Helix-Loop-Helix (HLH) RNA-binding motif of the EIF3A subunit interfere with Hepatitis C Virus Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) mediated translation initiation in vitro. Here we show that the EIF3A HLH motif controls translation of a small set of cellular transcripts enriched in oncogenic mRNAs, including MYC. We demonstrate that the HLH motif of EIF3A acts specifically on the 5-UTR of MYC mRNA and modulates the function of EIF4A1 on select transcripts during translation initiation. In Ramos lymphoma cell lines, which are dependent on MYC overexpression, mutations in the HLH motif greatly reduce MYC expression, impede proliferation and sensitize cells to anti-cancer compounds. These results reveal the potential of the EIF3A HLH motif in eIF3 as a promising chemotherapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "As a complex dynamic system, the brain exhibits spatially organized recurring patterns of activity over time. Coactivation patterns (CAPs), which analyzes data from each single frame, has been utilized to detect transient brain activity states recently. However, previous CAP analyses have been conducted at the group-level, which might neglect meaningful individual differences. Here, we estimate individual CAP states at both subject- and scan-level based on a densely-sampled dataset: Midnight Scan Club. We used differential identifiability, which measures the gap between intra- and intersubject similarity, to evaluate individual differences. We found individual CAPs at the subject-level achieved the best discrimination ability by maintaining high intra-subject similarity and enlarging inter-subject differences, and brain regions of association networks mainly contributed to the identifiability. On the other hand, scan-level CAP states were unstable across scans for the same participant. Expectedly, we found subject-specific CAPs became more reliable and discriminative with more data (i.e., longer duration). As the acquisition time of each participant is limited in practice, our results recommend a data collection strategy that collects more scans with appropriate duration (e.g., 12~15 mins/scan) to obtain more reliable subject-specific CAPs, when total acquisition time is fixed (e.g., 150 mins). Overall, this work has constructed reliable subject-specific CAP states with meaningful individual differences and provides a starting point for the subsequent applications of individual brain dynamics.",

    "abstract": "The ability to respond flexibly to an ever-changing environment relies on the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). How the OFC associates sensory information with predicted outcomes to enable flexible sensory learning in humans remains elusive. Here, we combine a probabilistic tactile reversal learning task with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate how lateral OFC (lOFC) interacts with the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) to guide flexible tactile learning in humans. fMRI results reveal that lOFC and S1 exhibit distinct task-dependent engagement: while the lOFC responds transiently to unexpected outcomes immediately following reversals, S1 is persistently engaged during re-learning. Unlike the contralateral stimulus-responsive S1, activity in ipsilateral S1 mirrors the outcomes of behavior during re-learning, which is closely related to top-down signals from lOFC. These findings suggest that lOFC contributes to teaching signals to dynamically update representations in sensory areas, which implements computations critical for adaptive behavior.",

    "abstract": "Individual cells exhibit substantial heterogeneity in protein abundance and activity, which is frequently reflected in broad distributions of fluorescently labeled reporters. Since all cellular components are intrinsically fluorescent to some extent, the observed distributions contain background noise that masks the natural heterogeneity of cellular populations. This limits our ability to characterize cell-fate decision processes that are key for development, immune response, tissue homeostasis, and many other biological functions. It is therefore important to separate the contributions from signal and noise in single-cell measurements. Addressing this issue rigorously requires deconvolving the noise distribution from the signal, but approaches in that direction are still limited. Here we present a non-parametric Bayesian formalism that performs such a deconvolution efficiently on multidimensional measurements, in a way that allows us to estimate confidence intervals. We use the approach to study the expression of the mesodermal transcription factor Brachyury in mouse embryonic stem cells undergoing differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Attention allows us to focus sensory processing on behaviorally relevant aspects of the visual world. One potential mechanism of attention is a change in the gain of sensory responses. However, changing gain at early stages could have multiple downstream consequences for visual processing. Which, if any, of these effects can account for the benefits of attention for detection and discrimination? Using a model of primate visual cortex we document how a Gaussian-shaped gain modulation results in changes to spatial tuning properties. Forcing the model to use only these changes failed to produce any benefit in task performance. Instead, we found that gain alone was both necessary and sufficient to explain category detection and discrimination during attention. Our results show how gain can give rise to changes in receptive fields which are not necessary for enhancing task performance.",

Here, we present a multiscale compartmental stochastic model that considers population dynamics, births, deaths, and species-specific transmission dynamics. The model considers two between-farm modes of FMD transmission integrating disease dynamics at the between-farm and within-farm levels. Our model outputs include the number of secondarily infected animals and farms, spatial dissemination, the role of animal movement and between- farm distances as transmission pathways, and the effectiveness of countermeasures. Here, we demonstrated that after 20 days of FMD dissemination, the median number of infected farms was 8. Spatial proximity was the predominant route associated bovine infection while in swine were linked with animal movements. Furthermore, the median distance between seeded and secondary infections was 5.77 with the highest spatial dissemination reaching 695.40 kilometers. The simulated control strategy results showed that depopulating 12 farms and vaccinating 15,000 farms per day after 20 days of silent FMD dissemination would contain 93.4% of epidemics with a median of 9 infected farms within 54 days after implementing control actions. In conclusion, the developed model highlights the need for developing multispecies FMD transmission models, especially in regions where multiple species are raised on the same premises.",

    "abstract": "Memories may be encoded in the brain via strongly interconnected groups of neurons, called assemblies. The concept of Hebbian plasticity suggests that these assemblies are generated through synaptic plasticity, strengthening the recurrent connections within select groups of neurons that receive correlated stimulation. To remain stable in absence of such stimulation, the assemblies need to be self-reinforcing under the plasticity rule. Previous models of such assembly maintenance require additional mechanisms of fast homeostatic plasticity often with biologically implausible timescales. Here we provide a model of neuronal assembly generation and maintenance purely based on spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) between excitatory neurons. It uses irregularly and stochastically spiking neurons and STDP that depresses connections of uncorrelated neurons. We find that assemblies do not grow beyond a certain size, because temporally imprecisely correlated spikes dominate the plasticity in large assemblies. Assemblies in the model can be learned or spontaneously emerge. The model allows for prominent, stable overlap structures between static assemblies. Further, assemblies can drift, particularly according to a novel, transient overlap-based mechanism. Finally the model indicates that assemblies grow in the aging brain, where connectivity decreases.\n\nAuthor summaryIt is widely assumed that memories are represented by ensembles of nerve cells that have strong interconnections with each other. It is to date not clear how such strongly interconnected nerve cell ensembles form, persist, change and age. Here we show that already a basic rule for activity-dependent synaptic strength plasticity can explain the learning or spontaneous formation and the stability of assemblies. In particular, it is not necessary to explicitly keep the overall total synaptic strength of a neuron nearly constant, a constraint that was incorporated in previous models in a manner inconsistent with current experimental knowledge. Furthermore, our model achieves the challenging task of stably maintaining many overlaps between assemblies and generating the experimentally observed drift of memory representations. Finally, the model predicts that if the number of synaptic connections in the brain decreases, as observed during aging, the size of the neuron ensembles underlying memories increases. This may render certain memories in the aging brain more robust and prominent but also less specific.",

    "abstract": "Flavonoids and carotenoids are pigments involved in stress mitigation and numerous other processes. Both pigment classes can contribute to flower and fruit coloration. Flavonoid aglycones and carotenoids are produced by a pathway that is largely conserved across land plants. Glycosylations, acylations, and methylations of the flavonoid aglycones can be species-specific and lead to a plethora of biochemically diverse flavonoids. We previously developed KIPEs for the automatic annotation of biosynthesis pathways and presented an application on the flavonoid aglycone biosynthesis.\n\nKIPEs3 is an improved version with additional features and the potential to identify not just the core biosynthesis players, but also candidates involved in the decoration steps and in the transport of flavonoids. Functionality of KIPEs3 is demonstrated through the analysis of the flavonoid biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana Nd-1, Capsella grandiflora, and Dioscorea dumetorum. We demonstrate the applicability of KIPEs to other pathways by adding the carotenoid biosynthesis to the repertoire. As a technical proof of concept, the carotenoid biosynthesis was analyzed in the same species and Daucus carota. KIPEs3 is available as an online service to enable access without prior bioinformatics experience.\n\nKIPEs3 facilitates the automatic annotation and analysis of biosynthesis pathways with a consistent and high quality in a large number of plant species.

Whether these influences reflect active visual processing in human ACs, which drives neuronal firing and concurrent broadband high-frequency activity (BHFA; >70 Hz), or whether they merely modulate sound processing is still debatable. Here, we presented auditory, visual, and audiovisual stimuli to 16 participants with stereo-EEG depth electrodes implanted near ACs for presurgical monitoring. Anatomically normalized group analyses were facilitated by inverse modeling of intracranial source currents. Cross-correlation and spatiotemporal pattern similarity analyses suggested cross-sensory visual influences, which lagged auditory responses by several tens of milliseconds in ACs. Visual stimuli also modulated the phase of intrinsic low-frequency oscillations and triggered 15-30-Hz event-related desynchronization in ACs. However, BHFA, a putative correlate of neuronal firing, was not significantly increased in ACs after visual stimuli, not even when they coincided with auditory stimuli. Intracranial recordings demonstrate cross-sensory modulations, but no indication of active visual processing in human ACs.",

    "abstract": "Circadian rhythms influence many behaviors and diseases1, 2. They arise from oscillations in gene expression caused by repressor proteins that directly inhibit transcription of their own genes. The fly circadian clock offers a valuable model for studying these processes, wherein Timeless (TIM) plays a critical role in mediating nuclear entry of the transcriptional repressor Period (PER) and the photoreceptor Cryptochrome (CRY) entrains the clock by triggering TIM degradation in light2, 3. The cryo-EM structure of the CRY:TIM complex reveals how a light-sensing cryptochrome recognizes its target. CRY engages a continuous core of N-terminal TIM armadillo (ARM) repeats, resembling how photolyases recognize damaged DNA, and binds a C-terminal TIM helix reminiscent of the interactions between light-insensitive CRYs and their partners in mammals. The structure highlights how the CRY flavin cofactor undergoes conformational changes that couple to large-scale rearrangements at the molecular interface, and how a phosphorylated segment in TIM may impact clock period by regulating the binding of importin- and the nuclear import of TIM:PER4, 5. Moreover, the structure reveals that the TIM N-terminus inserts into the restructured CRY pocket to replace the autoinhibitory C-terminal tail released by light, thereby providing a possible explanation for how the LS-TIM polymorphism adapts flies to different climates6, 7.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic plasticity is a hallmark of cancer and increasingly realized as a mechanism of resistance in androgen indifferent prostate tumors. It is critical to identify mechanisms and actionable targets driving phenotypic plasticity. Here, we report that loss of tristetraprolin (TTP, gene ZFP36), an RNA binding protein that regulates mRNA stability increases NF-{kappa}B activation and is associated with higher rates of aggressive disease and early recurrence in primary prostate cancer (PCa). We examined the clinical and biological impact of ZFP36 loss combined with PTEN loss, a known driver of PCa. Combined loss of PTEN and ZFP36 expression was associated with increased risk of recurrence in multiple independent primary PCa cohorts, and significantly reduced overall survival and time to progression following castration in genetically engineered mouse models. ZFP36 loss alters the cell state that is driven by PTEN loss, demonstrated by positive enrichment of gene sets including EMT, inflammation, TNF/NF-{kappa}B, IL6-JAK/STAT3. ZFP36 loss also induces enrichment of multiple gene sets involved in cell migration, chemotaxis, and proliferation. Use of the NF-{kappa}B inhibitor dimethylaminoparthenolide induced significant therapeutic responses in tumors with PTEN and ZFP36 co-loss and reversed castration resistance. This work identifies a novel molecular mechanism driving phenotypic plasticity and castration resistance through loss of ZFP36 expression, that can be reversed by inhibition of NF-{kappa}B activity.",

    "abstract": "Integrative analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and gene expression data across diverse tissues and cell types have enabled the identification of putative disease-critical tissues. However, co-regulation of genetic effects on gene expression across tissues makes it difficult to distinguish biologically causal tissues from tagging tissues. While previous work emphasized the potential of accounting for tissue co-regulation, tissue-specific disease effects have not previously been formally modeled. Here, we introduce a new method, tissue co-regulation score regression (TCSC), that disentangles causal tissues from tagging tissues and partitions disease heritability (or covariance) into tissue-specific components. TCSC leverages gene-disease association statistics across tissues from transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), which implicate both causal and tagging genes and tissues. TCSC regresses TWAS chi-square statistics (or products of z-scores) on tissue co-regulation scores reflecting correlations of predicted gene expression across genes and tissues. In simulations, TCSC distinguishes causal tissues from tagging tissues while controlling type I error. We applied TCSC to GWAS summary statistics for 78 diseases and complex traits (average N = 302K) and gene expression prediction models for 48 GTEx tissues. TCSC identified 21 causal tissue-trait pairs at 5% FDR, including well-established findings, biologically plausible novel findings (e.g. aorta artery and glaucoma), and increased specificity of known tissue-trait associations (e.g. subcutaneous adipose, but not visceral adipose, and HDL). TCSC also identified 17 causal tissue-trait covariance pairs at 5% FDR. For the positive genetic covariance between BMI and red blood cell count, brain substantia nigra contributed positive covariance while pancreas contributed negative covariance; this suggests that genetic covariance may reflect distinct tissue-specific contributions. Overall, TCSC is a precise method for distinguishing causal tissues from tagging tissues, improving our understanding of disease and complex trait biology.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell sequencing (SCS) enables exploring the pathways and processes of cells, and cell populations. However, there is a paucity of pathway enrichment methods designed to tolerate the high noise and low gene coverage of this technology. When gene expression data are noisy and signals are sparse, testing pathway enrichment based on the genes expression may not yield statistically significant results which is particularly problematic when detecting the pathways enriched in less abundant cells that are vulnerable to disturbances. In this project, we developed a Weighted Concept Signature Enrichment Analysis (WCSEA) algorithm specialized for pathway enrichment analysis from single cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq). WCSEA took a broader approach for assessing the functional relations of pathway gene sets to differentially expressed genes, and leverage the cumulative signature of molecular concepts characteristic of the highly differentially expressed genes, which we termed as the universal concept signature, to tolerate the high noise and low coverage of this technology. We then incorporated WCSEA into a R package called \"IndepthPathway\" for biologists to broadly leverage this method for pathway analysis based on bulk and single cell sequencing data. Through simulating technical variability and dropouts in gene expression characteristic of scRNA-seq as well as benchmarking on a real dataset of matched single cell and bulk RNAseq data, we demonstrate that IndepthPathway presents outstanding stability and depth in pathway enrichment results under stochasticity of the data, thus will substantially improve the scientific rigor of the pathway analysis for single cell sequencing data.

    "abstract": "Pannexins are single-membrane large-pore ion channels that release ATP upon activation. Three isoforms of pannexins, 1, 2, and 3, perform diverse cellular roles, including inflammation, differentiation, neuropathic pain, and ATP release. In this study, we report the cryoEM structure of pannexin 3 at 3.9 [A] and characterize the structural differences with pannexin isoforms 1 and 2. We observe the organization of the Pannexin 3 vestibule into two distinct chambers with a wider pore radius in comparison to both PANX1 and 2 isoforms. We further report the structure of pannexin1 congenital mutant R217H in the resolution range of 3.9 [A]. The congenital mutant R217H in transmembrane helix3 (TM3), R217H induce structural changes that leads to a partially closed pore and altered ATP interaction propensities. The channel conductance of the congenital mutant displays weakened voltage sensitivity. The results showcase a complete comparison of the three pannexin isoform structures that along with the structure of Pannexin 1 congenital mutant highlight distinct structural features of pannexin isoforms and the allosteric role of distant substitutions in dictating channel behavior in Pannexin 1.",

    "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has been suggested to be associated with impairment of model-based behavioral control. Meanwhile, recent work suggested shorter memory trace for negative than positive prediction errors (PEs) in OCD. We explored relations between these two suggestions through computational modeling. Based on the properties of cortico-basal ganglia pathways, we modeled human as an agent having a combination of successor representation (SR)-based system that enables model-based-like control and individual representation (IR)-based system that only hosts model-free control, with the two systems potentially learning from positive and negative PEs in different rates. We simulated the agents behavior in the environmental model used in the recent work that describes potential development of obsession-compulsion cycle. We found that the dual-system agent could develop enhanced obsession-compulsion cycle, similarly to the agent having memory trace imbalance in the recent work, if the SR- and IR-based systems learned mainly from positive and negative PEs, respectively. We then simulated the behavior of such an opponent SR+IR agent in the two-stage decision task, in comparison with the agent having only SR-based control. Fitting of the agents behavior by the model weighing model-based and model-free control developed in the original two-stage task study resulted in smaller weights of model-based control for the opponent SR+IR agent than for the SR-only agent. These results reconcile the previous suggestions about OCD, i.e., impaired model-based control and memory trace imbalance, raising a novel possibility that opponent learning in model(SR)-based and model-free controllers underlies obsession-compulsion. Our model cannot explain the behavior of OCD patients in punishment, rather than reward, contexts, but it could be resolved if opponent SR+IR learning operates also in the recently revealed non-canonical cortico-basal ganglia-dopamine circuit for threat/aversiveness, rather than reward, reinforcement learning, and the aversive SR + appetitive IR agent could actually develop obsession-compulsion if the environment is modeled differently.\n\nAuthor summaryObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is one of the major psychiatric disorders diagnosed in 2.5%-3% of the population, and is characterized as an enhanced cycle of obsessive thought, e.g., whether the door was locked, and compulsive action, e.g., checking door lock. It remains elusive why such an apparently maladaptive behavior could be enhanced. A prevailing theory proposes that humans use two control systems, flexible yet costly goal-directed system and inflexible yet costless habitual system, and impairment of the goal-directed system leads to OCD. On the other hand, recent work proposed a new theory that shorter memory trace for credit-assignment of negative, than positive, prediction errors can induce OCD. Relation between these two theories remains unclear. We show that opponent learning of particular type of goal-directed(-like) system, suggested to be implemented in the brain, and habitual system from positive versus negative prediction errors could exhibit an (apparent) overall decrease in goal-directed control and also develop enhanced obsession-compulsion cycle similar to the one developed by memory-trace imbalance, thereby bridging the two theories. Such an opponent learning of the two systems was actually suggested to be advantageous in certain dynamic environments, and could thus be evolutionarily selected at the cost of possible development of OCD.",

    "abstract": "Neural information routing relies on spatiotemporal activity dynamics across interconnected brain areas. However, it remains unclear how routing states emerge at fast spiking timescales and interact with the slower activity dynamics of larger networks during cognitive processes.\n\nHere, we show that localized neural spiking events generate long-range directional routing states with spiking activity in distant brain areas that dynamically switch or amplify during oscillatory bursts, selective attention, and decision-making. Computational modeling and neural recordings from lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and striatum of nonhuman primates revealed that cross-areal, directional routing states arise within [~]20 ms around spikes of single neurons. On average, LPFC spikes led activity in the ACC and striatum by few milliseconds. The routing state was amplified during LPFC beta bursts between the LPFC and striatum and switched direction during ACC theta/alpha bursts between ACC and LPFC. Selective attention amplified the lead of these theta/alpha-specific lead-ensembles in the ACC, while decision-making amplified the lead of ACC and LPFC spiking output over the striatum. Notably, the fast lead/lag relationships of cross-areal neuronal ensembles that were modulated by attention states or decision-making predicted firing rate dynamics of their neurons during those functional states at slower timescales. Overall, our findings demonstrate directional routing of spiking activity across nonhuman primate frontal and striatal areas, as well as the functional and network states that modulate the direction and magnitude of these interactions.\n\nSummaryFast spatio-temporal dynamics of brain activity subserves the routing of information across distant regions and is integral to flexible cognition, decision-making, and selective attention. This study demonstrates that routing dynamics emerge as 20 ms brief lead and lag relationships of spiking activities across distant brain areas. The direction and magnitude of the lead and lag relationships systematically switched during frequency-specific oscillatory bursts and when attention shifts to visual cues.",

    "abstract": "Circadian clocks are composed from molecular oscillators that pace rhythms of gene expression to the diurnal cycle. Therein, transcriptional-translational negative feedback loops (TTFLs) generate oscillating levels of transcriptional repressor proteins that regulate their own gene expression. In the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, the proteins Frequency (FRQ), the FRQ-interacting RNA helicase (FRH) and Casein-Kinase I (CK1) form the FFC complex that represses expression of genes activated by the White-Collar complex (WCC). A key question concerns how FRQ orchestrates molecular interactions at the core of the clock despite containing little predicted tertiary structure. We present the reconstitution and biophysical characterization of FRQ and the FFC in unphosphorylated and highly phosphorylated states. Site-specific spin labeling and pulse-dipolar ESR spectroscopy provides domain-specific structural details on the full-length, 989-residue intrinsically disordered FRQ and the FFC. FRQ contains a compact core that associates and organizes FRH and CK1 to coordinate their roles in WCC repression. FRQ phosphorylation increases conformational flexibility and alters oligomeric state but the changes in structure and dynamics are non-uniform. Full-length FRQ undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) to sequester FRH and CK1 and influence CK1 enzymatic activity. Although FRQ phosphorylation favors LLPS, LLPS feeds back to reduce FRQ phosphorylation by CK1 at higher temperatures. Live imaging of Neurospora hyphae reveals FRQ foci characteristic of condensates near the nuclear periphery. Analogous clock repressor proteins in higher organisms share little position-specific sequence identity with FRQ; yet, they contain amino-acid compositions that promote LLPS. Hence, condensate formation may be a conserved feature of eukaryotic circadian clocks.",

    "abstract": "In the past two decades, drifting fish aggregation devices (FADs) have revolutionised pelagic fisheries, and are now responsible for the majority of tuna purse seine catches. Here, we argue that by taking advantage of the same proven aggregative properties, FADs could be used to enhance the benefits provided by blue water Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). Using models of commercially-targeted fish populations, we explore the potential benefits that could be achieved if unfished conservation FADs were positioned within blue water MPAs. Our results suggest that conservation FADs could deliver benefits, both to target species and the broader ecosystem. By increasing the residence time of exploited species, conservation FADs will reduce average mortality rates inside MPAs. By increasing the local density of species whose populations are depressed by exploitation, FADs can also improve the function of ecosystems in blue water MPAs. Conservation FADs could therefore amplify the benefits of blue water MPAs. We find this amplification is largest in those contexts where blue water MPAs have attracted the most criticism - when their area is small compared to both the open ocean and the distribution of fish stocks that move through them.",

In the current study, a transgenic mouse that produced t10c12-CLA had been generated by inserting the Propionibacterium acnes isomerase (Pai) expression cassette into the Rosa26 locus, and its male offspring were used to decipher an irreversible long-term impact of t10c12-CLA on health and its mechanism of action. Compared to their wild-type C57BL/6J littermates, comprehensive phenotype profiling of biallelic pai/pai mice indicated that white fat was decreased while brown fat was increased reversely; meanwhile, more heat was released and the central activities were reduced. Besides decreased plasma triglycerides in both pai genotypes and increased serum FGF21 in pai/wt mice, RNA and protein analysis revealed that the fatty acid oxidation and thermogenesis capacity of brown adipose tissues were elevated via CPT1B and UCP1/2 over-expression. The results indicate that the t10c12-CLA-induced fat loss might be caused by the excess FGF21 and the increased mass and extra thermogenesis of brown adipose tissue in transgenic mice.",

    "abstract": "Short-term, acute warming events are increasing in frequency across the worlds oceans. For short-lived species like most copepods, these extreme events can occur over both within- and between-generational time scales. Yet, it is unclear whether exposure to acute warming during early life stages of copepods can cause lingering effects on metabolism through development, even after the event has ended. These lingering effects would reduce the amount of energy devoted to growth and affect copepod population dynamics. We exposed nauplii of an ecologically important coastal species, Acartia tonsa, to a 24-hour warming event (control: 18{degrees}C; treatment: 28{degrees}C), and then tracked individual respiration rate, body length, and stage duration through development. As expected, we observed a decrease in massspecific respiration rates as individuals developed. However, exposure to acute warming had no effect on the ontogenetic patterns in per-capita or mass-specific respiration rates, body length, or development time. The lack of these carryover effects through ontogeny suggests within-generational resilience to acute warming in this copepod species.",

Understanding the mechanism by which KSHV increases the infected cell population is crucial for curing KSHV-associated diseases. Here we demonstrate that KSHV preferentially infects CD14+ monocytes and sustains viral replication through the viral interleukin-6 (vIL6)-mediated activation of STAT1 and 3. Using vIL6-sufficient and vIL6-deficient recombinant KSHV, we demonstrated that vIL6 plays a critical role in promoting the proliferation and differentiation of KSHV-infected monocytes into macrophages. The macrophages derived from vIL6-sufficient KSHV infection showed a distinct transcriptional profile of elevated IFN-pathway activation with immune suppression and were compromised in T-cell stimulation function compared to those from vIL6-deficient KSHV infection or uninfected control. These results highlight a clever strategy, in which KSHV utilizes vIL6 to secure its viral pool by expanding infected dysfunctional macrophages. This mechanism also facilitates KSHV to escape from host immune surveillance and to establish a lifelong infection. 160\n\nSummaryKSHV causes multiple inflammatory diseases, however, the underlying mechanism is not clear.

    "abstract": "The photosynthetic and diazotrophic cyanobacterium Trichodesmium is a key contributor to marine biogeochemical cycles in the subtropical-oligotrophic oceans. Trichodesmium forms colonies that harbor a distinct microbial community, which expands their functional potential and is predicted to influence the cycling of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and iron (C, N, P, and Fe). To link key traits to taxa and elucidate how community structure influences nutrient cycling, we assessed Red Sea Trichodesmium colonies using metagenomics and metaproteomics. This diverse consortium comprises bacteria that typically associate with algae and particles, such as the ubiquitous Alteromonas macleodii, but also lineages specific to Trichodesmium, such as members from the order Balneolales. These bacteria carry functional traits that would influence resource cycling in the consortium, including siderophore biosynthesis, reduced phosphorus metabolism, vitamins, denitrification, and dissimilatory-nitrate-reduction-to-ammonium (DNRA) pathways. Denitrification and DNRA appeared to be modular as bacteria collectively completed the steps for these pathways. The vast majority of associated bacteria were auxotrophic for vitamins, indicating the interdependency of consortium members. Trichodesmium in turn may rely on associated bacteria to meet its high Fe demand as several lineages can synthesize the photolabile siderophores vibrioferrin, rhizoferrin, and petrobactin, enhancing the bioavailability of particulate-Fe to the entire consortium. Our results highlight that Trichodesmium is a hotspot for C, N, P, Fe, and vitamin exchange. The functional redundancy of nutrient cycling in the consortium likely underpins its resilience within an ever-changing global environment.\n\nImportanceColonies of the cyanobacteria Trichodesmium act as a biological hotspot for the usage and recycling of key resources such as C, N, P and Fe within an otherwise oligotrophic environment. While Trichodesmium colonies are known to interact with a unique community of algae and particle-associated microbes, our understanding of the taxa that populate these colonies and the gene functions they encode is still limited. Characterizing the taxa and adaptive strategies that influence consortium physiology and its concomitant biogeochemistry is critical in a future ocean predicted to have increasing particulate fluxes and resource-depleted regions.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screens on well-characterized human cancer cell lines have been widely used to identify novel cancer dependencies. However, the off-target effects of shRNA reagents pose a significant challenge in the analysis of these screens. To mitigate these off-target effects, various approaches have been proposed that aggregate different shRNA viability scores targeting a gene into a single gene-level viability score. Most computational methods for discovering cancer dependencies rely on these gene-level scores. In this paper, we propose a computational method, named NBDep, to find cancer self-dependencies by directly analyzing shRNA-level dependency scores instead of gene-level scores. The NBDep algorithm begins by removing known batch effects of the shRNAs and selecting a subset of concordant shRNAs for each gene. It then uses negative binomial random effects models to statistically assess the dependency between genetic alterations and the viabilities of cell lines by incorporating all shRNA dependency scores of each gene into the model. We applied NBDep to the shRNA dependency scores available at Project DRIVE, which covers 26 different types of cancer. The proposed method identified more well-known and putative cancer genes compared to alternative gene-level approaches in pan-cancer and cancer-specific analyses. Additionally, we demonstrated that NBDep controls type-I error and outperforms statistical tests based on gene-level scores in simulation studies.\n\nAuthor SummaryLarge-scale shRNA screening is increasingly being used in cancer genomics to discover genes involved in cancer by analyzing the viabilities of cell lines upon knocking down a gene using a pool of short hairpin RNAs (shRNA). However, off-target effects, which result from the knockdown of unintended genes, are a major issue in RNAi screening. To address this issue, various computational methods have been developed to aggregate shRNA viability scores into gene-level dependency scores. In this paper, we propose a method called NBDep to identify cancer gene drivers that directly addresses the challenge of off-target effects at the shRNA level. NBDep identifies cancer gene drivers in three classes: amplification, missense, and non-missense alterations. In this method, we first remove known batch effects, select a subset of the most consistent shRNAs of each gene, and then perform a negative binomial mixed-effect model. The NBDep method not only identifies well-recognized and novel cancer driver genes but also has more statistical power than gene-level-score methods while controlling type-error. In summary, NBDep presents a new technique for analyzing shRNA screens and has the potential to uncover previously unknown cancer dependencies.",

    "abstract": "Free-choice paradigms such as two-bottle choice (2BC) are commonly used to characterize ethanol consumption and preference of rodent models used to study alcohol use disorder (AUD). However, these assays are limited by low temporal resolution that misses finer patterns of drinking behavior, including circadian drinking patterns that are known to vary with age and sex and are affected in AUD pathogenesis. Modern, cost-effective tools are becoming widely available that could elucidate these patterns, including open-source, Arduino-based home-cage sipper devices. We hypothesized that adaptation of these home-cage sipper devices would uncover distinct age- and sex-related differences in temporal drinking patterns. To test this hypothesis, we used the sipper devices in a continuous 2BC paradigm using water and ethanol (10%; v/v) for 14 days to measure drinking patterns of male and female adolescent (3-week), young adult (6-week), and mature adult (18-week) C57BL/6J mice. Daily grams of fluid consumption were manually recorded at the beginning of the dark cycle, while home-cage sipper devices continuously recorded the number of sips. Consistent with prior studies, females consumed more ethanol than males, and adolescent mice consumed the most out of any age group. Correlation analyses of manually recorded fluid consumption versus home-cage sipper activity revealed a statistically significant prediction of fluid consumption across all experimental groups. Sipper activity was able to capture subtle circadian differences between experimental groups, as well as distinct individual variation in drinking behavior among animals. Blood ethanol concentrations were significantly correlated with sipper data, suggesting that home-cage sipper devices can accurately determine individual timing of ethanol consumption. Overall, our studies show that augmenting the 2BC drinking paradigm with automated home-cage sipper devices can accurately measure ethanol consumption across sexes and age groups, revealing individual differences and temporal patterns of ethanol drinking behavior. Future studies utilizing these home-cage sipper devices will further dissect circadian patterns for age and sex relevant to the pathogenesis of AUD, as well as underlying molecular mechanisms for patterns in ethanol consumption.\n\nHighlightsO_LIFemale mice consume more ethanol than males in a continuous access paradigm\nC_LIO_LIAdolescent male and female mice consume more ethanol than young or mature adult mice\nC_LIO_LIAutomated home-cage sipper devices accurately measure ethanol consumption\nC_LIO_LIDevices reveal sex- and age-dependent differences in circadian drinking patterns\nC_LIO_LIDevices reveal distinct individual variation in circadian drinking patterns\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Precise temporal regulation of Type I interferon signaling is imperative to effectively fight infections and cancerous cells without triggering autoimmunity. The key negative regulator of Type I interferon signaling is ubiquitin-specific protease 18 (USP18). USP18 cleaves interferon-inducible ubiquitin-like modifications through its canonical catalytic function and directly inhibits interferon receptor signaling through its scaffold role. USP18 loss-of-function dramatically impacts autoimmune disease, viral susceptibility, and cancer cell survival. However, the relative contribution of catalytic versus scaffold function is unresolved and must be determined to design effective therapeutics targeting USP18. To precisely delineate individual contribution, we evaluated the functional impact of single amino acid mutations that disrupt catalytic or scaffold activity. Here we demonstrate catalytic activity does not contribute to cell autonomous Type I interferon sensitivity across multiple cancer cell lineages. Furthermore, introducing a patient-derived mutation that disrupts scaffold function is sufficient to inhibit cancer growth. These findings establish a fundamental mechanistic basis for USP18 therapeutic design across diseases.\n\nOVERVIEWO_LIUSP18 is the key negative regulator of Type I interferon signaling in humans, mediating autoimmune disease, viral susceptibility, and cancer cell survival.\nC_LIO_LIUSP18 cleaves interferon-inducible ubiquitin-like modifications through its canonical catalytic function and attenuates interferon receptor signaling through its scaffold role.\nC_LIO_LIDelineating the contribution of each function is critical to resolve the mechanistic basis of interferon regulation and enable the development of therapeutics targeting USP18.\nC_LIO_LIWe demonstrate that cell intrinsic interferon sensitivity is not mediated by loss of catalytic activity.

Interactions between epithelial cells and their stromal microenvironment instruct branching morphogenesis but remain incompletely understood. Here we employed fibroblast-organoid or fibroblast-spheroid co-culture systems and time-lapse imaging to reveal that physical contact between fibroblasts and epithelial cells and fibroblast contractility are required to induce mammary epithelial branching. Pharmacological inhibition of ROCK or non-muscle myosin II, or fibroblast-specific knock-out of Myh9 abrogate fibroblast-induced epithelial branching. Furthermore, fibroblast-induced branching requires epithelial proliferation and is associated with distinctive epithelial patterning of YAP and ERK activity along organoid branches, which is dependent on fibroblast contractility. Together, we identify fibroblast contractility as a novel stromal factor driving mammary epithelial morphogenesis. Our study contributes to comprehensive understanding of overlapping but divergent employment of mechanically active fibroblasts in developmental versus tumorigenic programs.",

Utilizing samples from 1,705 individuals in 5 countries, we examined putative determinants of immunity, including: single nucleotide polymorphisms, ancestry informative markers, herpesvirus status, age, and sex. In healthy subjects, we found significant differences in cytokine levels, leukocyte phenotypes, and gene expression. Transcriptional responses also varied by cohort, and the most significant determinant was ancestry. In influenza infected subjects, we found two disease severity immunophenotypes, largely driven by age. Additionally, cytokine regression models show each determinant differentially contributes to acute immune variation, with unique and interactive, location-specific herpesvirus effects. These results provide novel insight into the scope of immune heterogeneity across diverse populations, the integrative effects of factors which drive it, and the consequences for illness outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Humans can easily extract the rhythm of a complex sound, like music, and move to its regular beat, for example in dance. These abilities are modulated by musical training and vary significantly in untrained individuals. The causes of this variability are multidimensional and typically hard to grasp with single tasks. To date we lack a comprehensive model capturing the rhythmic fingerprints of both musicians and non-musicians. Here we harnessed machine learning to extract a parsimonious model of rhythmic abilities, based on the behavioral testing (with perceptual and motor tasks) of individuals with and without formal musical training (n = 79). We demonstrate that the variability of rhythmic abilities, and their link with formal and informal music experience, can be successfully captured by profiles including a minimal set of behavioral measures. These profiles can shed light on individual variability in healthy and clinical populations, and provide guidelines for personalizing rhythm-based interventions.",

    "abstract": "The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a critical component of a limbic basal ganglia circuit that is thought to play an important role in decision-making and the processing of rewarding stimuli. As part of this circuit, dopamine D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) of the NAc core are known to send a major projection to the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). However, the functional role of this SNr-projecting NAc D1-MSNs (NAcD1-MSN-SNr) pathway is still largely uncharacterized. Moreover, as the SNr is thought to belong to both limbic and motor information processing basal ganglia loops, it is possible that the NAcD1-MSN-SNr pathway may be able to influence both limbic and motor functions. In this study we investigated the effect of optogenetic activation of the NAcD1-MSN-SNr pathway on reward-learning and locomotor behavior. Stimulation of the axon terminals of NAc core D1-MSNs in the SNr induced a preference for a laser-paired location, self-stimulation via a laser-paired lever, and augmented instrumental responding for a liquid reward-paired lever. Additionally, stimulation was observed to increase locomotor behavior when delivered bilaterally and induced contralateral turning behavior when delivered unilaterally. These findings indicate that the NAcD1-MSN-SNr pathway is able to control both reward learning and motor behaviors.",

    "abstract": "The human neocortex consists of tangentially organized layers with unique cytoarchitectural properties. These layers show spatial variations in thickness and cytoarchitecture across the neocortex, which is thought to support brain function through enabling targeted corticocortical connections. Here, leveraging maps of the six cortical layers in 3D human brain histology, we aimed to quantitatively characterize the systematic covariation of laminar structure in the cortex and its functional consequences. After correcting for the effect of cortical curvature, we identified a spatial pattern of changes in laminar thickness covariance from lateral frontal to posterior occipital regions, which differentiated the dominance of infra- versus supragranular layer thickness. Corresponding to the laminar regularities of cortical connections along cortical hierarchy, the infragranular-dominant pattern of laminar thickness was associated with higher hierarchical positions of regions, mapped based on resting-state effective connectivity in humans and tract-tracing of structural connections in macaques. Moreover, we show that regions with comparable laminar thickness patterns correspond to inter-regional structural covariance, maturational coupling, and transcriptomic patterning, indicating developmental relevance. In sum, here we characterize the association between organization of laminar thickness and processing hierarchy, anchored in ontogeny. As such, we illustrate how laminar organization may provide a foundational principle ultimately supporting human cognitive functioning.",

    "abstract": "Postmortem investigations in autism have identified anomalies in neural cytoarchitecture across limbic, cerebellar, and neocortical networks. These anomalies include narrow cell mini-columns and variable neuron density. However, difficulty obtaining sufficient post-mortem samples has often prevented investigations from converging on reproducible measures. Recent advances in processing magnetic resonance diffusion weighted images (DWI) make in vivo characterization of neuronal cytoarchitecture a potential alternative to post-mortem studies. Using extensive DWI data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Developmentsm (ABCD(R)) study 142 individuals with an Autism diagnosis were compared with 8971 controls using a restriction spectrum imaging (RSI) framework that characterized total neurite density (TND), its component restricted normalized directional diffusion (RND), and restricted normalized isotropic diffusion (RNI). A significant decrease in TND was observed in Autism in the right cerebellar cortex ({beta}=-0.005, SE =0.0015, p=0.0267), with significant decreases in RNI and significant increases in RND found diffusely throughout posterior and anterior aspects of the brain, respectively. Furthermore, these regions remained significant in post-hoc analysis when the ASD sample was compared against a subset of 1404 individuals with other psychiatric conditions (pulled from the original 8971). These findings highlight the importance of characterizing neuron cytoarchitecture in Autism and the significance of their incorporation as physiological covariates in future studies.\n\nLay abstractChildren with autism have differences in neuron structure unique from the general population and populations with attention, anxiety, and depression disorders. Brain imaging data on over 11,000 children was acquired at ages 9 and 11 years-of-age. Estimates of neuron density were derived from brain imaging data using recently validated techniques and comparative groups were composed using parent reported diagnosis of autism and other common psychiatric disorders. Consistent macro-structural changes in brain have been difficult to replicate and micro-structural changes have been historically difficult to acquire with other methodologies. We identified regional differences in the density of neuron cell bodies, neuron branching, and total neuron density in those with a reported diagnosis of ASD. Findings were consistent when compared against those with other psychiatric disorders in post-hoc analysis. These findings demonstrate the viability and importance of investigating in vivo changes to neurons in those with autism to advance our current understanding of related physiology.",

    "abstract": "Cytokines of the interleukin (IL)-1 family are widely expressed in epithelial surfaces, including the epidermis, where they play a key role in the maintenance of barrier integrity and host defense. A recent report associated the IL-1 family member IL-33 with stress granules (SGs) in epithelial cells. Formation of SGs is promoted by the aggregation of proteins harboring low complexity regions (LCRs). In this study, using computational analyses, we predicted the presence of LCRs in six of the eleven IL-1 family members. Among these, IL-38 contained a long LCR and localized to Ras GTPase-activating protein binding protein 1 (G3BP1) positive SGs, as well as to G3BP1 negative intracellular protein condensates in keratinocytes exposed to oxidative stress (OS). In addition, we identified two highly aggregation-prone amyloid core (AC) motifs in the IL-38 LCR and detected the formation of amyloid IL-38 aggregates in response to OS in cells and in vitro. Disulfide bond mapping, in silico modelling and the analysis of specific cysteine mutants supported a model in which specific oxidation-sensitive cysteines act as redox switches to modify the conformation of IL-38 and thus the surface exposure of its ACs, shuttling it from a soluble state into biomolecular condensates. Finally, the presence of IL-38 granules in human epidermal layers highly exposed to environmental OS suggests that oxidation-induced formation of amyloid aggregates, as a previously unrecognized intrinsic biological property of IL-38, may be physiologically relevant at this epithelial barrier.",

    "abstract": "Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) plays an essential role in determining the temporal ordering of the cell cycle phases. However, despite significant progress in studying regulators of CDK, it remains elusive how they coordinately affect CDK activity at the single-cell level and how CDK controls the temporal order of cell cycle events. This could be due to the lack of tools to monitor CDK activity in living cells. Here, we elucidate the dynamics of CDK activity in fission yeast and mammalian cells by using a newly developed CDK activity biosensor, Eevee-spCDK, based on Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). Taking advantage of this system, we unravel the profile of CDK activity in vegetatively growing S. pombe cells. Thus, we detect a transient increase in S phase followed by a gradual increment during G2 phase. CDK activity then reaches its maximum in early M phase and rapidly decreases at mitotic exit. During G2 phase, CDK activity exhibits a biphasic pattern, i.e., an early slow increase and a late fast rise prior to the G2/M phase transition, as predicted from mathematical studies. Remarkably, although CDK activity does not necessarily correlate with cyclin levels, we find that it converges to the same level around mitotic onset in several mutant backgrounds, including pom1{Delta} cells and wee1 or cdc25 overexpressing cells. These data provide the first direct evidence that cells enter M phase when CDK activity reaches a high threshold, consistent with the quantitative model of cell cycle progression in fission yeast.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal mitochondria play important roles beyond ATP generation, including Ca2+ uptake, and therefore have instructive roles in synaptic function and neuronal response properties. Mitochondrial morphology differs significantly in the axon and dendrites of a given neuronal subtype, but in CA1 pyramidal neurons (PNs) of the hippocampus, mitochondria within the dendritic arbor also display a remarkable degree of subcellular, layer- specific compartmentalization. In the dendrites of these neurons, mitochondria morphology ranges from highly fused and elongated in the apical tuft, to more fragmented in the apical oblique and basal dendritic compartments, and thus occupy a smaller fraction of dendritic volume than in the apical tuft. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this striking degree of subcellular compartmentalization of mitochondria morphology are unknown, precluding the assessment of its impact on neuronal function. Here, we demonstrate that this compartment-specific morphology of dendritic mitochondria requires activity-dependent, Camkk2- dependent activation of AMPK and its ability to phosphorylate two direct effectors: the pro-fission Drp1 receptor Mff and the recently identified anti-fusion, Opa1-inhibiting protein, Mtfr1l. Our study uncovers a new activity- dependent molecular mechanism underlying the extreme subcellular compartmentalization of mitochondrial morphology in dendrites of neurons in vivo through spatially precise regulation of mitochondria fission/fusion balance.",

    "abstract": "Cell proliferation is a fundamental process underlying embryogenesis, homeostasis, wound healing, and cancer. The process involves multiple events during each cell cycle, such as cell growth, contractile ring formation, and division to daughter cells, which affect the surrounding cell population geometrically and mechanically. However, existing methods do not comprehensively describe the dynamics of multicellular structures involving cell proliferation at a subcellular resolution. In this study, we present a novel model for proliferative multicellular dynamics at the subcellular level by building upon the nonconservative fluid membrane (NCF) model that we developed in earlier research. The NCF model utilizes a dynamically-rearranging closed triangular mesh to depict the shape of each cell, enabling us to analyze cell dynamics over extended periods beyond each cell cycle, during which cell surface components undergo dynamic turnover. The proposed model represents the process of cell proliferation by incorporating cell volume growth and contractile ring formation through an energy function and topologically dividing each cell at the cleavage furrow formed by the ring. Numerical simulations demonstrated that the model recapitulated the process of cell proliferation at subcellular resolution, including cell volume growth, cleavage furrow formation, and division to daughter cells. Further analyses suggested that the orientation of actomyosin stress in the contractile ring plays a crucial role in the cleavage furrow formation, i.e., circumferential orientation can form a cleavage furrow but isotropic orientation cannot. Furthermore, the model replicated tissue-scale multicellular dynamics, where the successive proliferation of adhesive cells led to the formation of a cell sheet and stratification on the substrate. Overall, the proposed model provides a basis for analyzing proliferative multicellular dynamics at subcellular resolution.",

    "abstract": "Proper cellular proteostasis, essential for viability, requires a network of chaperones and cochaperones. ATP-dependent chaperonin TRiC/CCT partners with cochaperones prefoldin (PFD) and phosducin-like proteins (PhLPs) to facilitate the folding of essential eukaryotic proteins. Using cryoEM and biochemical analyses, we determine the ATP-driven cycle of TRiC-PFD-PhLP2A interaction. In the open TRiC state, PhLP2A binds to the chambers equator while its N-terminal H3-domain binds to the apical domains of CCT3/4, thereby displacing PFD from TRiC. ATP-induced TRiC closure rearranges the contacts of PhLP2A domains within the closed chamber. In the presence of substrate, actin and PhLP2A segregate into opposing chambers, each binding to the positively charged inner surfaces formed by CCT1/3/6/8. Notably, actin induces a conformational change in PhLP2A, causing its N-terminal helices to extend across the inter-ring interface to directly contact a hydrophobic groove in actin. Our findings reveal an ATP-driven PhLP2A structural rearrangement cycle within the TRiC chamber to facilitate folding.\n\nHighlights- Structural analysis of TRiC-mediated folding cycle with cochaperones PhLP2A and PFD.\n- The interactions of PhLP2A and PFD with TRiC are mutually exclusive.\n- PhLP2A domains interact in a subunit-specific manner with the TRiC chamber.\n- PhLP2A domains are rearranged in ATP-closed TRiC to contact actin across the ring interface",

    "abstract": "Biogeochemical sulfur cycling in sulfidic karst systems is largely driven by abiotic and biological sulfide oxidation, but the fate of elemental sulfur (S0) that accumulates in these systems is not well understood. The Frasassi Cave system (Italy) is intersected by a sulfidic aquifer that mixes with small quantities of oxygen-rich meteoric water, creating Proterozoic-like conditions and supporting a prolific ecosystem driven by sulfur-based chemolithoautotrophy. To better understand the cycling of S0 in this environment, we examined the geochemistry and microbiology of sediments underlying widespread sulfide-oxidizing mats dominated by Beggiatoa. Sediment populations were dominated by uncultivated relatives of sulfur cycling chemolithoautotrophs related to Sulfurovum, Halothiobacillus, Thiofaba, Thiovirga, Thiobacillus, and Desulfocapsa, as well as diverse uncultivated anaerobic heterotrophs affiliated with Bacteroidota, Anaerolineaceae, Lentimicrobiaceae, and Prolixibacteraceae. Desulfocapsa and Sulfurovum populations accounted for 12-26% of sediment 16S rRNA amplicon sequences and were closely related to isolates which carry out autotrophic S0 disproportionation in pure culture. Gibbs energy ({Delta}Gr) calculations revealed that S0 disproportionation under in situ conditions is energy yielding. Microsensor profiles through the mat-sediment interface showed that Beggiatoa mats consume dissolved sulfide and oxygen, but a net increase in acidity was only observed in the sediments below. Together, these findings suggest that disproportionation is an important sink for S0 generated by microbial sulfide oxidation in this oxygen-limited system and may contribute to the weathering of carbonate rocks and sediments in sulfur- rich environments.",

Using the data generated from our bioinformatic analysis, we developed a new genomic- and Alphafold2-based pipeline for discovery of putative T6Es. We experimentally validated the toxic and immunity activities of four putative antibacterial T6SS effector proteins and four cognate immunity genes from diverse species, respectively. We used Foldseek to predict possible mechanisms of action of the putative T6Es, which was much more effective than sequence-based methods. Evidence of the possible mechanisms of action of the putative T6Es was explored through fluorescence microscopy, where we observed cell wall-targeting, DNA degradation, and cell filamentation.

    "abstract": "The growth and division of mycobacteria, which include several clinically relevant pathogens, deviate significantly from that of canonical bacterial models. Despite their Gram-positive ancestry, mycobacteria synthesize and elongate a diderm envelope asymmetrically from the poles, with the old pole elongating more robustly than the new pole. In addition to being structurally distinct, the molecular components of the mycobacterial envelope are also evolutionarily unique, including the phosphatidylinositol-anchored lipoglycans lipomannan (LM) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM). LM and LAM modulate host immunity during infection, but their role outside of intracellular survival remains poorly understood, despite their widespread conservation among non-pathogenic and opportunistically pathogenic mycobacteria. Previously, Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis mutants producing structurally altered LM and LAM were shown to grow slowly under certain conditions and to be more sensitive to antibiotics, suggesting that mycobacterial lipoglycans may support cellular integrity or growth. To test this, we constructed multiple biosynthetic lipoglycan mutants of M. smegmatis and determined the effect of each mutation on cell wall biosynthesis, envelope integrity, and division. We found that mutants deficient in LAM, but not LM, fail to maintain cell wall integrity in a medium-dependent manner, with envelope deformations specifically associated with septa and new poles. Conversely, a mutant producing abnormally large LAM formed multiseptated cells in way distinct from that observed in a septal hydrolase mutant. These results show that LAM plays critical and distinct roles at subcellular locations associated with division in mycobacteria, including maintenance of local cell envelope integrity and septal placement.\n\nSignificanceMycobacteria cause many diseases including tuberculosis (TB). Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) is a lipoglycan of mycobacteria and related bacteria, playing important roles as a surface-exposed pathogen-associated molecular pattern during host-pathogen interactions. Its importance is highlighted by the facts that anti-LAM antibody appears to be protective against TB disease progression, and urine LAM serves as a diagnostic marker for active TB. Given the clinical and immunological relevance of the molecule, it was a striking gap in knowledge that we did not know the cellular function of this lipoglycan in mycobacteria. In this study, we demonstrated that LAM regulates septation, a principle potentially generalizable to other lipoglycans widely found in a group of Gram-positive bacteria that lack lipoteichoic acids.",

We cultured the cells from surface seawater using dilution-to-extinction culturing. Their growth was very slow (0.18-0.24 day-1) and was inhibited by exposure to light. The genomes, of ca. 3.08 Mbp, encoded archaella, archaeal motility structures, and multiple sets of paralogs, including 80 genes in enolase superfamily and 44 genes in NAD(P)-dependent dehydrogenase family. We propose that these paralogs participate in multiple parallel pathways of non-phosphorylative sugar and sugar acid catabolism, and demonstrate that, as predicted by this scheme, the sugars -fucose and -rhamnose and their lactone and acid forms are utilized by these cells.",

Upon T cell activation, miR-15/16 are downregulated, allowing rapid expansion of differentiated effector T cells to mediate a sustained immune response. Here, using conditional deletion of miR-15/16 in immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) that express FOXP3, we identify new functions of the miR-15/16 family in T cell immunity. miR-15/16 are indispensable to maintain peripheral tolerance by securing efficient suppression by a limited number of Tregs. miR-15/16-deficiency alters Treg expression of critical functional proteins including FOXP3, IL2R/CD25, CTLA4, PD-1 and IL7R/CD127, and results in accumulation of functionally impaired FOXP3loCD25loCD127hi Tregs. Excessive proliferation in the absence of miR-15/16 inhibition of cell cycle programs shifts Treg diversity and produces an effector Treg phenotype characterized by low expression of TCF1, CD25 and CD62L, and high expression of CD44. These Tregs fail to control immune activation of CD4+ effector T cells, leading to spontaneous multi-organ inflammation and increased allergic airway inflammation in a mouse model of asthma.

Here, we characterized a germ-line-specific conditional knockout (cKO) mouse of FIGNL1. The Fignl1 cKO male mice showed defective chromosome synapsis and impaired meiotic DSB repair with the accumulation of RAD51/DMC1 on chromosomes in mid-meiotic prophase I, supporting a role of FIGNL1 in a post-assembly stage of RAD51/DMC1 filaments. Fignl1 cKO spermatocytes accumulate RAD51 and DMC1 ensembles on chromosomes not only in early meiotic prophase I but also in meiotic S-phase. These RAD51/DMC1 assemblies are independent of meiotic DSB formation. Finally, we showed that purified FIGNL1 dismantles RAD51 filament on double-stranded (ds)DNA as well as ssDNA.

    "abstract": "Many phage engineering technologies, mainly based on the CRISPR-Cas system, have been recently developed. Here we present a method to genetically engineer the Escherichia coli phages T5, T7, and P1 by adapting a technology, called pORTMAGE, developed for engineering bacterial genomes. The technology comprises of E. coli harboring a plasmid encoding a potent recombinase and a gene transiently silencing a repair system. Oligonucleotides with the desired phage mutation are electroporated into E. coli followed by infection of the target bacteriophage. The high efficiency of this technology, ranging from 1-14% of desired recombinants, allows low-throughput screening for the desired mutant. We demonstrated the use of this technology for single-base substitutions, for deletions of 50 bases, for insertions of 20 bases, and for three different phages. The technology may be adjusted for use across many bacterial and phage strains.",

    "abstract": "Volvocine green algae are a model for understanding the evolution of mating types and sexes. They are facultatively sexual, with gametic differentiation occurring in response to nitrogen starvation (-N) in most genera, and to sex inducer hormone (SI) in Volvox. The conserved RWP RK family transcription factor (TF) MID is encoded by the minus mating type (MT) locus or male sex-determining region (SDR) of heterothallic volvocine species and dominantly determines minus or male gametic differentiation. However, the factor(s) responsible for establishing the default plus or female differentiation programs have remained elusive. We performed a phylo transcriptomic screen for autosomal RWP-RK TFs induced during gametogenesis in unicellular isogamous Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Chlamydomonas) and in multicellular oogamous Volvox carteri (Volvox) and identified a single conserved ortho-group we named Volvocine Sex Regulator 1 (VSR1). Chlamydomonas vsr1 mutants of either mating type failed to mate and could not induce expression of key mating-type-specific genes. Similarly, Volvox vsr1 mutants in either sex could initiate sexual embryogenesis, but the presumptive eggs or androgonidia (sperm packet precursors) were infertile and unable to express key sex-specific genes. Yeast two-hybrid assays identified a conserved domain in VSR1 capable of self-interaction or interaction with the conserved N terminal domain of MID. In vivo co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated association of VSR1 and MID in both Chlamydomonas and Volvox. These data support a new model for volvocine sexual differentiation where VSR1 homodimers activate expression of plus/female gamete-specific-genes, but when MID is present MID-VSR1 heterodimers are preferentially formed and activate minus/male gamete-specific-genes.\n\nSignificance StatementSex and recombination are conserved features of eukaryotic life cycles, but sex determination mechanisms are diverse, and are poorly understood in most major taxa. Our study identified a long-sought regulator of sexual differentiation in volvocine green algae--the RWP-RK family transcription factor (TF) VSR1-- leading to the first complete paradigm for mating type or sex determination in this lineage. Our results support a model where gametically expressed VSR1 homodimerizes and activates plus/female specific genes. When the dominant sex-linked minus/male RWP-RK family TF MID is present MID-VSR1 heterodimers are preferentially formed and activate minus/male genes. The widespread association of RWP-RK TFs with gamete differentiation in the green lineage suggests that a similar paradigm may operate throughout the plant kingdom.",

    "abstract": "Fungi in the basidiomycete genus Malassezia are the most prevalent eukaryotic microbes resident on the skin of human and other warm-blooded animals and have been implicated in skin diseases and systemic disorders. Analysis of Malassezia genomes revealed that key adaptations to the skin microenvironment have a direct genomic basis, and the identification of mating/meiotic genes suggests a capacity to reproduce sexually, even though no sexual cycle has yet been observed. In contrast to other bipolar or tetrapolar basidiomycetes that have either two linked mating-type-determining (MAT) loci or two MAT loci on separate chromosomes, in Malassezia species studied thus far the two MAT loci are arranged in a pseudobipolar configuration (linked on the same chromosome but capable of recombining). By incorporating newly generated chromosome-level genome assemblies, and an improved Malassezia phylogeny, we infer that the pseudobipolar arrangement was the ancestral state of this group and revealed six independent transitions to tetrapolarity, seemingly driven by centromere fission or translocations in centromere- flanking regions. Additionally, in an approach to uncover a sexual cycle, Malassezia furfur strains were engineered to express different MAT alleles in the same cell. The resulting strains produce hyphae reminiscent of early steps in sexual development and display upregulation of genes associated with sexual development as well as others encoding lipases and a protease potentially relevant for pathogenesis of the fungus. Our study reveals a previously unseen genomic relocation of mating-type loci in fungi and provides insight towards the discovery of a sexual cycle in Malassezia, with possible implications for pathogenicity.\n\nSignificance StatementMalassezia, the dominant fungal group of the mammalian skin microbiome, is associated with numerous skin disorders. Sexual development and yeast-to-hyphae transitions, governed by genes at two mating-type (MAT) loci, are thought to be important for fungal pathogenicity. However, Malassezia sexual reproduction has never been observed. Here, we used chromosome-level assemblies and comparative genomics to uncover unforeseen transitions in MAT loci organization within Malassezia, possibly related with fragility of centromeric-associated regions. Additionally, by expressing different MAT alleles in the same cell, we show that Malassezia can undergo hyphal development and this phenotype is associated with increased expression of key mating genes along with other genes known to be virulence factors, providing a possible connection between hyphal development, sexual reproduction, and pathogenicity.",

    "abstract": "To facilitate our understanding of the often rapid and nuanced dynamics of extracellularly exposed proteomes during signaling events, it is important to devise robust workflows affording fast time resolution without biases and confounding factors. Here, we present Surface-exposed protein Labeling using PeroxidaSe, H2O2, and Tyramide-derivative (SLAPSHOT), to label extracellularly exposed proteins in a rapid, sensitive, and specific manner, while preserving cellular integrity. This experimentally simple and flexible method utilizes recombinant soluble APEX2 peroxidase that is applied to cells, thus circumventing biological perturbations, tedious engineering of tools and cells, and labeling biases. APEX2 neither requires metal cations for activity nor contains disulfide bonds, conferring versatility for a wide spectrum of experimental setups. We applied SLAPSHOT followed by quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis to examine the immediate and extensive cell surface expansion and ensuing restorative membrane shedding upon the activation of Scott syndrome-linked TMEM16F, a ubiquitously expressed calcium-dependent phospholipid scramblase and ion channel. Time-course data ranging from one to thirty minutes of calcium stimulation using wild-type and TMEM16F deficient cells revealed intricate co-regulation of known protein families, including those in the integrin and ICAM families. Crucially, we identified proteins that are known to reside in intracellular organelles, including ER, as occupants of the freshly deposited membrane, and mitovesicles as an abundant component and contributor to the extracellularly exposed proteome. Our study not only provides the first accounts of the immediate consequences of calcium signaling on the extracellularly exposed proteome, but also presents a blueprint for the application of SLAPSHOT as a general approach for monitoring extracellularly exposed protein dynamics.\n\nHighlightsAn enzyme-driven method to tag extracellularly exposed proteins in an unbiased manner with a superior combination of temporal resolution, spatial specificity, and sensitivity\n\nA general approach applicable to primary and scarce cells without involving cellular engineering\n\nShort time scale proteome dynamics of Jurkat cells with and without TMEM16F revealed by SLAPSHOT coupled with quantitative mass spectrometry provide insights into phospholipid scrambling-mediated plasma membrane remodeling",

    "abstract": "AbstractDuring mammalian insemination, most of the deposited sperm are lost by retrograde flow or the female reproductive tracts immune response. Once semen enters the uterus, seminal fluid and sperm elicit leukocyte infiltration that contributes to the elimination of sperm in the uterus. However, unlike the uterus, invading sperm do not trigger a phagocytic response in the oviduct in the absence of dysfunction or disease states. Thus, the oviduct possesses a distinct immunological microenvironment that tolerates sperm while maintaining the capacity to respond to pathogens. It has been suggested that sperm glycocalyx contributes to innate oviductal tolerance, but the cell and molecular mechanisms are not understood. The current investigation focused on the role of sialic acid-containing glycoconjugates on sperm and their potential to elicit innate tolerance via cognate sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectins (Siglecs) expressed in the oviduct. In this manuscript, we report our discovery of eight Siglecs (Siglecs-1, -2, -3, -5, -10, -11, -14, -15) expressed in the lower pig oviduct, five of which are known for immune inhibitory functions (Siglecs-2, -3, -5, -10, and -11) and how these may play a role in achieving sperm-induced immune suppression in the oviduct microenvironment. Mass spectrometry profiling of porcine sperm revealed the presence of a mixture of 2,3 and 2,6 linked sialic acids with 2,3-linked sialic acids as the dominant linkage. Of the detected glycans, several sialic acid-containing glycoconjugates were identified as potential ligands for Siglecs (among O-linked glycans: NeuAc1GalNAc1, NeuGc1GalNAc1, NeuAc2Gal1GalNAc1; attached to glycolipids: NeuAc2Gal1GalNAc1Gal1Glc1, Fuc1Gal1GalNAc1NeuAc1Gal1Glc1). This is the first report of Siglec expression in the mammalian oviduct and total glycan analysis of porcine sperm. The results of this study reveal the potential for a sperm-sialoglycan and oviductal-Siglec axis that may contribute to the distinct immunophysiology of the oviduct fundamentally required for undisrupted reproduction in mammals.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have been driving the development of algorithms of clustering heterogeneous cells. We introduce a novel clustering algorithm scQA, which can effectively and efficiently recognize different cell types via qualitative and quantitative analysis. It iteratively extracts quasi-trend-preserved genes to conform a consensus by representing expression patterns with dropouts qualitatively and quantitatively, and, then automatically clusters cells using a new label propagation strategy without specifying the number of cell types in advance. Validated on 20 public scRNA-seq datasets, scQA consistently outperformed 9 salient tools in both accuracy and efficiency across 16 out of 20 datasets tested, and ranked top 2 or 3 across the other 4 datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate scQA can extract informative genes in both perspectives of biology and data wise by performing consensus, allowing genes used for landmark construction multiple characteristics, which is essential for clustering cells accurately. Overall, scQA could be a useful tool for discovery of cell types that can be integrated into general scRNA-seq analyses.",

    "abstract": "The revolution of  omics technologies highlighted that associated microorganisms (also called microbiota) are integrated into the metabolic functions of their hosts. Yet when performing any particular type of  omics experiment, be it metabolomics, transcriptomics, or (meta)genomics, it is extremely difficult to interpret the observed relationships between metabolites, transcripts, and microbial species. This is due to the massive amount of data generated for each  omics technology, but also the cognitive challenge of interconnecting these observations and contextualizing them in their biological (eco)system. For these reasons, there is a need for testing methods that can facilitate the translation of these  omics experimental observations into putative molecular processes or biological interactions. To accelerate the interpretation of  omics data from a description of microbial, transcript, or metabolite identities or abundances into a functional understanding of the interplay between the individual entities of the biological system, we designed a novel multi-omics strategy for the annotation and integration of metabolomics and metagenomics data. We generated metabolome and microbiome datasets by LC-MS/MS based metabolomics profiling and metagenomic sequencing, respectively. Comprehensive metabolite annotations were obtained by molecular networking and computational annotation of fragmentation spectra. Associations between microbes and GNPS molecular networks were predicted by machine learning and visualized as an extensively annotated, nested interaction network in Cytoscape. As a proof of concept, we applied this strategy to scalp swabs from a cohort of healthy volunteers with varying scalp sebum levels and were able to elucidate the antagonistic interaction between two well-characterized microbes, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Cutibacterium acnes.",
