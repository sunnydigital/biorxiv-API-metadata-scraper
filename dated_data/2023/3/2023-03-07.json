    "abstract": "Intestine is a highly radiation-sensitive organ that could be injured during the radiotherapy for abdominal or pelvic cavity tumors. However, the dynamic change of the intestinal microenvironment related to radiation-induced intestine injury (RIII) is still unclear. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we pictured a dynamic landscape of the intestinal microenvironment during RIII and regeneration. We showed that the multicellular ecosystem of intestine exhibited heterogeneous radiosensitivities. We revealed the distinct dynamic patterns of three subtypes of intestinal stem cells (ISCs), and the cellular trajectory analysis suggested a complex interconversion pattern among them. For the immune cells, we found that Ly6c+ monocytes can give rise to both pro-inflammatory macrophages and resident macrophages after RIII. Besides, through cellular communication analysis, we identified a positive feedback loop between the macrophages and endothelial cells, which could amplify the inflammatory response induced by radiation. Overall, our study provides a valuable single-cell map of the dynamic multicellular ecosystem during RIII and regeneration, which may facilitate the understanding of the mechanism of RIII.",

    "abstract": "In contrast to many eukaryotic organisms, trypanosomes only contain a single mitochondrion per cell. Within that singular mitochondrion, the protist carries a single mitochondrial genome that consists of a complex DNA network, the kinetoplast DNA (kDNA). Segregation of the replicated kDNA is coordinated by the basal body of the cells single flagellum. The tripartite attachment complex (TAC) forms a physical connection between the proximal end of the basal body and the kDNA. This allows anchoring of the kDNA throughout the cell cycle and couples kDNA segregation with the separation of the basal bodies prior to cell division. Over the past years, several components of the TAC have been identified. To shed light on the structure of the cytoplasmic part of the TAC (known as the exclusion zone), we performed cryo-electron tomography on whole cells. This allowed us to acquire three-dimensional high-resolution images of the exclusion zone in situ. We observed that the exclusion zone filaments offer great mechanical flexibility for basal body movement. We measured the dimensions of the individual structural elements of the area, as well as the overall orientation and positioning of the basal bodies towards the mitochondrial kDNA pocket. Using a combination of experimental data and modelling, we generated a structural model of the exclusion zone protein p197. Our findings suggest that the majority of p197 consists of a string of spectrin-like repeats. We propose that these structural units provide the architecture of a molecular spring and that they are required in the TAC to withstand the mechanical forces generated through basal body repositioning events during kDNA segregation and motility of the organism.",

    "abstract": "Calorie restriction increases lifespan. While some tissue-specific protective effects of calorie restriction have been described, the impact of calorie restriction on the gastrointestinal tract remains unclear. We found increased abundance of chromogranin A+, including orexigenic ghrelin+, endocrine cells in the stomach of calorie-restricted mice. This effect coincided with increased Notch target Hes1 and Notch ligand Jag1 and was reversed when Notch signaling was blocked using the {gamma}-secretase inhibitor DAPT. Using primary cultures and genetically-modified reporter mice, we determined that increased endocrine cell abundance was due to altered stem and progenitor proliferation. Different from the intestine, calorie restriction decreased gastric Lgr5+ stem cells, while increasing a FOXO1/Neurog3+ subpopulation of endocrine progenitors in a Notch-dependent manner. Further, calorie restriction triggered nuclear localization of FOXO1, which was sufficient to promote endocrine cell differentiation. Taken together, the data indicate that calorie restriction promotes gastric endocrine cell differentiation triggered by active Notch signaling and regulated by FOXO1.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of highly immune invasive and transmissible variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has decreased the effectiveness of existing vaccines. It is, therefore, critical to develop effective and safe therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 infections, especially for the most vulnerable and immunocompromised patients. Neutralizing antibodies have been shown to be successful at preventing severe disease from early SARS-CoV-2 strains, although their efficacy has diminished with the emergence of new variants. Here, we aim to develop fully human and broadly neutralizing monoclonal (mAb) and bispecific (BsAb) antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. Specifically, we first identified two antibodies from human transgenic mice that bind to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and are capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern with high to moderate affinity. Two non-competing clones with the highest affinity and functional blocking of ACE2 binding were then selected to be engineered into two BsAbs, which were then demonstrated to have relatively improved affinity, ACE2 blocking ability, and pseudovirus inhibition against several variants, including Omicron (B.1.1.529). Our findings provide one mAb candidate and two bsAb candidates for consideration of further clinical development and suggest that the bispecific format may be more effective than mAbs for SARS-CoV-2 treatment.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, numerous strategies have emerged to answer the growing demand for graftable tissues. Tissue engineering and in-vitro production are one of them. Among all the engineered tissues, skin is one of the most advanced. Nevertheless, biofabrication of graftable and fully functional skin substitutes is still far from being reached. Skin reconstruction, particularly dermis, necessitates cultivation and maturation for several weeks (> 3 weeks) to recover the tissues composition and functions, which prevent its transfer to clinical applications. Thus, several strategies, including 3D bioprinting, have been explored to accelerate these productions. In the present study, based on the successful application of 3D bioprinting achieved by our group for skin reconstruction in 21 days, we propose to detail the biological behaviors and maturation phases occurring in the bioprinted skin construct thanks to a descriptive approach transferred from the bioprocess field. The aim is to comprehensively characterize dermis construct maturation phases (cell proliferation and ECM secretion) to master later the interdependent and consecutive mechanisms involved in in-vitro production. Thus, standardized quantitative techniques were deployed to describe 3D bioprinted dermis proliferation and maturation phases. Then, in a second step, various parameters potentially impacting the dermis reconstruction phases were evaluated to challenge our methodology and reveal the biological behavior described (fibroblast proliferation and migration, cell death, ECM remodeling with MMP secretion). The parameters studied concern the bioprinting practice including various printed geometries, bioink formulations and cellular physiology in relation with their nutritional supplementation with selected medium additives.",

    "abstract": "We propose two quantum algorithms for a problem in bioinformatics, position weight matrix (PWM) matching, which aims to find segments (sequence motifs) in a biological sequence such as DNA and protein that have high scores defined by the PWM and are thus of informational importance related to biological function. The two proposed algorithms, the naive iteration method and the Monte-Carlo-based method, output matched segments, given the oracular accesses to the entries in the biological sequence and the PWM. The former uses quantum amplitude amplification (QAA) for sequence motif search, resulting in the query complexity scaling on the sequence length n, the sequence motif length m and the number of the PWMs K as [Formula], which means speedup over existing classical algorithms with respect to n and K. The latter also uses QAA, and further, quantum Monte Carlo integration for segment score calculation, instead of iteratively operating quantum circuits for arithmetic in the naive iteration method; then it provides the additional speedup with respect to m in some situation. As a drawback, these algorithms use quantum random access memories and their initialization takes O(n) time. Nevertheless, our algorithms keep the advantage especially when we search matches in a sequence for many PWMs in parallel.",

Here, we present ELITE, a new digital cytometry method that utilizes linear programming to solve the deconvolution problem. ELITE uses as inputs a mixture matrix representing bulk measurements, and a signature matrix representing molecular fingerprints of the cell types to be identified. The signature matrix can be obtained from single-cell datasets or the literature, making ELITE more flexible than other methods that rely solely on single-cell data. We evaluated ELITE on three publicly available single-cell datasets and compared it with five other deconvolution methods, showing superior performance, particularly when there were cell types with similar expression profiles.

In vertebrates, both - and {beta}-tubulin have multiple isotypes encoded by different genes, which are intrinsic factors in regulating microtubule functions. However, structures of microtubules composed of different tubulin isotypes, especially -tubulin isotypes, remain largely unknown. Here, we purified recombinant tubulin heterodimers composed of different mouse -tubulin isotypes, including 1A, 1C and 4A, with {beta}-tubulin isotype {beta}2A. We further assembled and determined the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of 1A/{beta}2A, 1C/{beta}2A, and 4A/{beta}2A microtubules. Our structural analysis demonstrated that 4A/{beta}2A microtubules exhibit a longitudinal contraction between tubulin interdimers compared with 1A/{beta}2A and 1C/{beta}2A microtubules. Collectively, our findings reveal that -tubulin isotype composition could tune microtubule structures, and also provide evidence for the \"tubulin code\" hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Gasdermin D (GSDMD) is the common effector for cytokine secretion and pyroptosis downstream of inflammasome activation by forming large transmembrane pores upon cleavage by inflammatory caspases. Here we report the surprising finding that GSDMD cleavage is not sufficient for its pore formation. Instead, GSDMD is lipidated by S-palmitoylation at Cys191 upon inflammasome activation, and only palmitoylated GSDMD N-terminal domain (GSDMD-NT) is capable of membrane translocation and pore formation, suggesting that palmitoylation licenses GSDMD activation. Treatment by the palmitoylation inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate and alanine mutation of Cys191 abrogate GSDMD membrane localization, cytokine secretion, and cell death, without affecting GSDMD cleavage. Because palmitoylation is formed by a reversible thioester bond sensitive to free thiols, we tested if GSDMD palmitoylation is regulated by cellular redox state. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) mildly and LPS plus the NLRP3 inflammasome activator nigericin markedly elevate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and GSDMD palmitoylation, suggesting that these two processes are coupled. Manipulation of cellular ROS by its activators and quenchers augment and abolish, respectively, GSDMD palmitoylation, GSDMD pore formation and cell death. We discover that zDHHC5 and zDHHC9 are the major palmitoyl transferases that mediate GSDMD palmitoylation, and when cleaved, recombinant and partly palmitoylated GSDMD is 10-fold more active in pore formation than bacterially expressed, unpalmitoylated GSDMD, evidenced by liposome leakage assay. Finally, other GSDM family members are also palmitoylated, suggesting that ROS stress and palmitoylation may be a general switch for the activation of this pore-forming family.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryGSDMD palmitoylation is induced by ROS and required for pore formation",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveInflammasomes modulate the release of bioactive IL-1{beta}. Excessive IL-1{beta} levels are detected in patients with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) and cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) with mutated and unmutated inflammasome components, raising questions on the mechanisms of IL-1{beta} regulation in these disorders.\n\nMethodsTo investigate how the NLRP3 inflammasome is modulated in sJIA, we focused on Tmem178, a negative regulator of calcium levels in macrophages, and measured IL-1{beta} and caspase-1 activation in wild-type (WT) and Tmem178-/- macrophages following calcium chelators, silencing of Stim1, a component of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), or by expressing a Tmem178 mutant lacking Stim1 binding site. Mitochondrial function in both genotypes was assessed by measuring oxidative respiration, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), and mitochondrial damage. CSS development was analyzed in Perforin-/-/Tmem178-/- mice infected with LCMV in which inflammasome or IL-1 signaling was pharmacologically inhibited. Human TMEM178 and IL-1B transcripts were analyzed in a dataset of peripheral blood monocytes from healthy controls and active sJIA patients.\n\nResultsTMEM178 levels are reduced in monocytes from sJIA patients while IL-1B show increased levels. Accordingly, Tmem178-/- macrophages produce elevated IL-1{beta} compared to WT cells. The elevated intracellular calcium levels following SOCE activation in Tmem178-/- macrophages induce mitochondrial damage, release mtROS, and ultimately, promote NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In vivo, inhibition of inflammasome or IL-1 neutralization prolongs Tmem178-/- mouse survival to LCMV-induced CSS.\n\nConclusionDownregulation of Tmem178 levels may represent a new biomarker to identify sJIA/CSS patients that could benefit from receiving drugs targeting inflammasome signaling.",

Bacterial replication ceases when macrophages organize around the infection and form a granuloma. This granuloma response is accomplished independently of adaptive immunity that is typically required to organize granulomas. The C. violaceum-induced granuloma requires at least two separate defense pathways, gasdermin D and iNOS, to maintain the integrity of the granuloma architecture. These innate granulomas successfully eradicate C. violaceum infection. Therefore, this new C. violaceum-induced granuloma model demonstrates that innate immune cells successfully organize a granuloma and thereby eradicate infection by an environmental pathogen.",

    "abstract": "The host recognition modules encoding the injection machinery and receptor binding proteins (RBPs) of bacteriophages are variable genomic units predisposed to mutation and recombination to maintain infectivity toward co-evolving bacterial hosts. In this study, we reveal how Alteromonas mediterranea schitovirus A5 shares its host recognition module, including tail fiber (TF) and cognate chaperone, with phages from distantly related families including Alteromonas myovirus, V22. While the chaperone of V22 is essential for producing active TFs, here we demonstrate production of functional A5 TFs regardless of chaperone co-expression. AlphaFold-generated models of TF and chaperone pairs from phages A5, V22, and other Alteromonas phages reveal how amino acid insertions within both A5-like proteins results in a knob domain duplication in the TF and a {beta}-hairpin \"tentacle\" extension of the chaperone. These structural modifications are linked to chaperone dependency differences between the A5 and V22 TFs. Structural similarity between the chaperones and intramolecular chaperone domains of other phage RBPs suggests an additional function of these chaperones as transient TF \"caps\". Finally, our identification of homologous host recognition modules used by morphologically distinct phages implies that HGT and recombination events between unrelated phages may be a more common process than previously thought among Caudoviricetes phages.",

    "abstract": "The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is an interbacterial weapon composed of thousands of protein subunits and predicted to require significant cellular energy to deploy, yet a fitness cost from T6SS use is rarely observed. Here, we identify host-like conditions where the T6SS incurs a fitness cost using the beneficial symbiont, Vibrio fischeri, which uses its T6SS to eliminate competitors in the natural squid host. We hypothesized that a fitness cost for the T6SS could be dependent on the cellular energetic state and used theoretical ATP cost estimates to predict when a T6SS-dependent fitness cost may be apparent. Theoretical energetic cost estimates predicted a minor relative cost for T6SS use in fast-growing populations (0.4-0.45% of total ATP used cell-1), and a higher relative cost (3.1-13.6%) for stationary phase cells. Consistent with these predictions, we observed no significant T6SS-dependent fitness cost for fast-growing populations typically used for competition assays. However, the stationary phase cell density was significantly lower in the wild-type strain, compared to a regulator mutant that does not express the T6SS, and this T6SS-dependent fitness cost was between 11 and 23%. Such a fitness cost could influence the prevalence and biogeography of T6SSs in animal-associated bacteria. While the T6SS may be required in kill or be killed scenarios, once the competitor is eliminated there is no longer selective pressure to maintain the weapon. Our findings indicate an evolved genotype lacking the T6SS would have a growth advantage over its parent, resulting in the eventual dominance of the unarmed population.",

How bacterial cyclases recognize phage infection is not known. Here we show that staphylococcal phages produce a highly structured 400-nt RNA, termed CBASS-activating bacteriophage RNA (cabRNA), that binds to a positively charged surface of the CdnE03 cyclase and promotes the synthesis of the cyclic dinucleotide cGAMP. Phages that escape CBASS immunity harbor mutations that lead to the generation of a longer form of the cabRNA that cannot activate CdnE03.

    "abstract": "The baculovirus IE1 gene encodes a multifunctional protein that is essential for both DNA replication and RNA transcription of the virus. Prior to viral DNA replication, IE1 promotes early gene transcription when localized in hr-dependent foci. During viral DNA replication, the IE1 foci expand and fuse to generate the virogenic stroma (VS) with IE1 forming the VS reticulum. To explore the IE1 structural features essential for this coordinated localization, we constructed various IE1 mutants based on three putative domains (N, I, and C). We determined that a BDI motif located in the intrinsic disorder region (IDR) between the N and I domains acts as a nuclear localization signal, whereas BDII and HLH in the C domain are required for VS localization in infected cells or for chromosomal association in uninfected mitotic cells. Deletion of the SLiM (short linear motif) located in the I domain restrains both nuclear- and VS localization. Intra-molecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) probes of IE1 mutants revealed a conformational change of the I-C two-domain fragment during infection, which was inhibited by aphidicolin, suggesting that IE1 undergoes a stage-dependent conformational change. Further, homo-dimerization of the I domain and stage-dependent conformational changes require an intact SLiM. Mutational analysis of SLiM revealed that VS localization and chromosomal association were retained following S291A and S291E substitutions, but hr-dependent focus formation differed between the two mutations. These results suggest that coordinated IE1 localization is controlled by SLiM-dependent conformational changes and that are dependent on the SLiM phosphorylation state.\n\nImportanceSLiMs (short linear motifs) are compact non-globular protein interaction interfaces that mediate various cellular functions and as such are often mimicked by viruses to rewire cellular pathways. Here, we found that an unusual type of viral SLiM acts as a conformational switch rather than a cellular mimic. Prior to viral DNA replication, the baculovirus IE1 protein promotes early gene transcription within its focus. During viral DNA replication, the IE1 foci expand and fuse to form the virogenic stroma where late virus replication events occur. Our results indicate that IE1 undergoes a conformational change that is dependent on the infection stage and SLiM phosphorylation. This work provides new insights into the role SLiMs play in heterotypic and homotypic protein-protein interactions.",

    "abstract": "Cells must coordinate the activation of thousands of replication origins dispersed throughout their genome. Active transcription is known to favor the formation of mammalian origins, although the role that RNA plays in this process remains unclear. We show that the ORC1 subunit of the human Origin Recognition Complex interacts with RNAs transcribed from genes with origins in their transcription start sites (TSSs), displaying a positive correlation between RNA binding and origin activity. RNA depletion, or the use of ORC1 RNA-binding mutant, result in inefficient activation of proximal origins, linked to impaired ORC1 chromatin release. ORC1 RNA binding activity resides in its intrinsically disordered region, involved in intra- and inter-molecular interactions, regulation by phosphorylation, and phase-separation. We show that RNA binding favors ORC1 chromatin release, by regulating its phosphorylation and subsequent degradation. We propose that fluctuating concentrations of RNA during the cell cycle may play a sequential role in controlling origins through interaction with this flexible region of ORC1. Our results unveil a novel non-coding function of RNA as a dynamic component of the chromatin, orchestrating the activation of replication origins.\n\nOne sentence summaryThe human origin recognition complex subunit 1 ORC1, binds to RNAs transcribed from genes with origins of replication at the TSS, which is required for optimal origin activation.",

Although SWI/SNF subunits are commonly mutated in disease, therapeutic options are limited by our inability to predict SWI/SNF gene targets and conflicting studies on functional significance. Here, we leverage a fast-acting inhibitor of SWI/SNF remodeling to elucidate direct targets and effects of SWI/SNF. Blocking SWI/SNF activity causes a rapid and global loss of chromatin accessibility and transcription. Whereas repression persists at most enhancers, we uncover a compensatory role for the EP400/TIP60 remodeler, which reestablishes accessibility at most promoters during prolonged loss of SWI/SNF. Indeed, we observe synthetic lethality between EP400 and SWI/SNF in lung cancer cell lines and human cancer patient data. Our data define a set of molecular genomic features that accurately predict gene sensitivity to SWI/SNF inhibition in diverse cancer cell lines, thereby improving the therapeutic potential of SWI/SNF inhibitors.\n\nHighlights- Genes repressed by long-term SWI/SNF loss do not accurately reflect direct targets\n- Promoters that fail to reestablish activity are those lacking a compensatory remodeler\n- Accessibility and activity recovery requires EP400, synthetically lethal with SWI/SNF\n- SWI/SNF dependence in cancer cells can be predicted from the promoter chromatin state",

    "abstract": "The nucleolus is a dynamic structure where ribosome subunits are produced. Indeed, nucleoli respond to any change in cellular homeostasis by altering the rate of ribosome biogenesis, thus working as a stress sensor. Therefore, an imbalance in ribosome biogenesis promotes changes in morphology and function and can evoke a nucleolar stress response. Changes in the structure and composition of nucleoli impair ribosome biogenesis and have been described as nucleolar stress, a mechanism related to aging and cancer.\n\nHere, we show the role of the RNA binding protein Hnrnpk in nucleolar dynamics and ribosome function. Hnrnpk is a ribonucleoprotein in charge of escorting nascent transcripts to its processing and nuclear export to ribosomes. When Hnrnpk is overexpressed, the nucleolus is altered and shows stress-like phenotype, with accumulation and delocalization of components such as Ncl, driving ribosome biogenesis impairment and halting protein translation.\n\nNucleolin haploinsufficiency is correlated with enlarged nucleoli, increased ribosome components and translation and induces a reduction in lifespan. Thus, gain of Ncl generated by Hnrnpk overexpression can cause ribosome biogenesis defects associated with ribosome impairment leading to ribosomopathies and bone marrow failure syndrome.\n\nAging and bone marrow failure share common biological hallmarks. Indeed, Hnrnpk overexpression and nucleolar stress trigger cell cycle arrest and senescence of the cells, a feature of both processes.\n\nTogether, these findings support the idea that nucleolar abnormalities contribute to ribosome impairment, thus triggering the onset of hematopoiesis and the aging process.

    "abstract": "BackgroundMutations in genes encoding nuclear pore proteins (NUPs) cause steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) and focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). The mechanisms of how NUP deficiency may cause podocyte dysfunction and failure of the kidney filtration barrier are elusive. The tightly controlled activity of the transcriptional effectors of the evolutionarily conserved Hippo pathway YAP and TAZ is essential for podocyte homeostasis. Here we analyze the role of NUPs in controlling YAP/TAZ nuclear import and activity in podocytes.\n\nMethodsWe used quantitative label-free mass spectrometry to characterize the YAP/TAZ interactomes in podocytes, particularly identifying NUP interactions. Moreover, we specifically studied NUP205 in controlling YAP/TAZ nuclear import and YAP/TAZ-dependent target gene expression.\n\nResultsHere we identify the disease-causing nuclear pore proteins NUP107, NUP133, NUP205, and XPO5 as components of YAP and TAZ protein complexes in podocytes. We demonstrate that NUP205 is essential for YAP/TAZ nuclear import. The nuclear interaction of YAP/TAZ with TEAD1 and their transcriptional activity were dependent on NUP205 expression. Furthermore, we identify a feedback regulatory mechanism that controls YAP activity depending on TAZ-mediated NUP205 expression.\n\nConclusionThis study links the disease protein NUP205 with the activity of the transcriptional regulators and Hippo effectors YAP and TAZ and suggests a pathogenic role of YAP/TAZ-deregulation in podocytes in patients with NUP205 mutations. Moreover, this study suggests an important role of YAP/TAZ signaling in human FSGS.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTUnderstanding the interference of signaling pathways in genetic diseases is essential to finally develop tailored treatment strategies. The increasing number of pathogenic variants causing focal-segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) comprises genes encoding for proteins of the nuclear-cytoplamic shuttling machinery. We here found several of these proteins in an unbiased interactome analysis of the Hippo signaling effector proteins YAP and TAZ in podocytes, pointing to a connection between nucleoporins and the Hippo pathway. Further analyses confirmed that NUP205 is essential for correct YAP/TAZ shuttling; depletion of NUP205 resulted in cytoplasmic retention and inactivation of YAP/TAZ. We suggest the nuclear pore and hippo signaling as a pathogenic module in FSGS.",

    "abstract": "The Na+-dependent phosphate cotransporter-2A (NPT2A, SLC34A1) is a primary regulator of extracellular phosphate homeostasis. Its most prominent structural element is a carboxy-terminal PDZ ligand that binds Na+/H+ Exchanger Regulatory Factor-1 (NHERF1, SLC9A3R1). NHERF1, a multidomain PDZ protein,establishes NPT2A membrane localization and is required for hormone-sensitive phosphate transport. NPT2A also possesses an uncharacterized internal PDZ ligand. Two recent clinical reports describe congenital hypophosphatemia in children harboring Arg495His or Arg495Cys variants within the internal PDZ motif. The wild-type internal 494TRL496 PDZ ligand binds NHERF1 PDZ2, which we consider a regulatory domain. Ablating the internal PDZ ligand with a 494AAA496 substitution blocked hormone-sensitive phosphate transport. Complementary approaches, including CRISPR/Cas9 technology, site-directed mutagenesis, confocal microscopy, and modeling, showed that NPT2A Arg495His or Arg495Cys variants do not support PTH or FGF23 action on phosphate transport. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicate that both variants bind NHERF1 similarly to WT NPT2A. However, in contrast to WT NPT2A, NPT2A Arg495His or Arg495Cys variants remain at the apical membrane and are not internalized in response to PTH. We predict that Cys or His substitution of the charged Arg495 changes the electrostatics, preventing phosphorylation of the upstream Thr494, interfering with phosphate uptake in response to hormone action, and inhibiting NPT2A trafficking. We advance a model wherein the carboxyterminal PDZ ligand defines apical localization NPT2A, while the internal PDZ ligand is essential for hormone-triggered phosphate transport.",

Many cold-adapted species from the subarctic and Central and Southern European Mountain systems display frequent allopatry with disjunct distributions of their populations. The same concerns Holarctic species which are many and which almost regularly show various degrees of differentiation between the continents. In this study, we analyze high- throughput target enrichment data for ten groups of arctic-alpine and Holarctic lepidopteran species sampled from four main regions across the Holarctic realm - Fennoscandia, North America, Alps and Altai. We first aimed to assess whether the genetic differences in the nuclear genome reflect observed DNA barcode divergences and second, whether the gap between population and species-level differences can be dissected using genomic data. We compared the phylogenetic trees and uncorrected pairwise genetic distances obtained from target enrichment and the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) barcodes for each of the study species. Additionally, we also performed a suite of population genetic and species delimitation analyses to further shed light on patterns of intraspecific variation using a large number of nuclear markers. We observed that in about one half of the cases, DNA barcodes tended to show phylogenetic relationships similar to the target enrichment markers. We report varying levels of nuclear genetic differentiation among the populations analyzed, starting from low differentiation of geographically separated populations to the deeper separation of some Nearctic population and further arctic-alpine disjunction. Given that no single consistent pattern emerged across different case studies, we demonstrate that the delimitation of allopatric populations into species could be done much more efficiently and in a consistent manner if based on a large set of universal genetic loci, which would help in reaching standards for taxonomic delimitation of allopatric populations.",

    "abstract": "Behavioural avoidance has obvious benefits for animals facing environmental stressors such as pathogen-contaminated foods. Most current bioinsecticides are based on the environmental and opportunistic bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) that kills targeted insect pests upon ingestion. While food and oviposition avoidance of Bt bioinsecticide by targeted insect species was reported, this remained to be addressed in non-target organisms, especially those affected by chronic exposure to Bt bioinsecticide such as Drosophila species. Here, using a two-choice oviposition test, we showed that female flies of three Drosophila species (four strains of D. melanogaster, D. busckii and D. suzukii) avoided laying eggs in the presence of Bt var. kurstaki bioinsecticide, with potential benefits for the offspring and females fitness. Avoidance occurred rapidly, regardless of the fraction of the bioinsecticide suspension (spores and toxin crystals versus soluble toxins/components) and independently of the female motivation for egg laying. Our results suggest that, in addition to recent findings of developmental and physiological alterations upon chronic exposure of non-target Drosophila, this bioinsecticide may have greater ecological implications in the field for the Drosophila community and their associated natural enemies than previously thought.",

    "abstract": "Uracil DNA glycosylases (UDGs) excise uracil from DNA arising from dUMP misincorporation during replication or from cytosine deamination. Besides functioning in canonical uracil repair, UDGs cooperate with DNA base modifying enzymes to effect mutagenesis or DNA demethylation. Mammalian cells express four UDGs, the functional dissection of which represents a challenge. Here, we used Schizosaccharomyces pombe with only two UDGs, Ung1 and Thp1, as a simpler model to study functional interactions in uracil repair. We show that despite a predominance of Ung1 activity in cell extracts, both UDGs act redundantly against genomic uracil accumulation and mutations from cytosine deamination in cells. Notably, Thp1 but not Ung1-dependent repair is cytotoxic under genomic uracil stress induced by 5-fluorouracil exposure or AID expression. Also, Thp1-but not Ung1-mediated base excision is recombinogenic, accounting for more than 60% of spontaneous mitotic recombination events in a recombination assay. Hence, the qualitative outcome of uracil repair depends on the initiating UDG; while Ung1 shows expected features of a bona-fide DNA repair enzyme, Thp1-initiated repair appears slow and rather non-productive, suggesting a function beyond canonical DNA repair. Given the epigenetic role of TDGs, the mammalian orthologs of Thp1, we performed transcriptome analyses and identified a possible function of Thp1 in stabilizing gene expression.",

    "abstract": "The thiol redox balance in the periplasm of E. coli depends on the DsbA/B pair for oxidative power and the DsbC/D system as its complement for isomerization of non-native disulfides. While the standard redox potentials of those systems are known, the in vivo redox potential imposed onto protein thiol disulfide pairs in the periplasm remains unknown. Here, we used genetically encoded redox probes (roGFP2 and roGFP-iL), targeted to the periplasm, to directly probe the thiol redox homeostasis in this compartment. These probes contain two cysteine residues, that are virtually completely reduced in the cytoplasm, but once exported into the periplasm, can form a disulfide bond, a process that can be monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy. Even in the absence of DsbA, roGFP2, exported to the periplasm, was fully oxidized, suggesting the presence of an alternative system for the introduction of disulfide bonds into exported proteins. However, the absence of DsbA shifted the periplasmic thiol-redox potential from -228 mV to a more reducing -243 mV and the capacity to re-oxidize periplasmic roGFP2 after a reductive pulse was significantly decreased. Re-oxidation in a DsbA strain could be fully restored by exogenous oxidized glutathione (GSSG), while reduced GSH accelerated re-oxidation of roGFP2 in the WT. In line, a strain devoid of endogenous glutathione showed a more reducing periplasm, and was significantly worse in oxidatively folding PhoA, a native periplasmic protein and substrate of the oxidative folding machinery. PhoA oxidative folding could be enhanced by the addition of exogenous GSSG in the WT and fully restored in a {Delta}dsbA mutant. Taken together this suggests the presence of an auxiliary, glutathione-dependent thiol-oxidation system in the bacterial periplasm.",

    "abstract": "The AAA-ATPase Msp1 extracts mislocalized outer membrane proteins and thus contributes to mitochondrial proteostasis. Using pull down experiments we show that trypanosomal Msp1 localizes to both glycosomes and the mitochondrial outer membrane, where it forms a stable complex with four outer membrane proteins. The trypanosome-specific pATOM36 mediates complex assembly of a-helically anchored mitochondrial outer membrane proteins such as protein translocase subunits. Inhibition of their assembly triggers a pathway that results in the proteasomal digestion of unassembled substrates. Using inducible single, double and triple RNAi cell lines combined with proteomic analyses we demonstrate that not only Msp1 but also the trypanosomal homolog of the AAA-ATPase VCP are implicated in this quality control pathway. Moreover, in the absence of VCP three out of the four Msp1-interacting mitochondrial proteins are required for efficient proteasomal digestion of pATOM36 substrates suggesting they act in concert with Msp1. pATOM36 is a functional analogue of the yeast MIM complex and possibly of human MTCH2 suggesting that similar mitochondrial quality control pathways linked to Msp1 might also exist in yeast and humans.",

Transient binding to the membrane has a profound impact on protein function, serving to induce conformational changes and alter biochemical and biophysical parameters by increasing the local concentration of factors and restricting diffusion to two dimensions. Despite the centrality of the membrane in serving as a template for cell biology, there are few reported high-resolution structures of peripheral membrane proteins bound to the membrane. We analyzed the utility of lipid nanodiscs to serve as a template for cryo-EM analysis of peripheral membrane proteins. We tested a variety of nanodiscs and we report a 3.3 [A] structure of the AP2 clathrin adaptor complex bound to a 17-nm nanodisc, with sufficient resolution to visualize a bound lipid head group. Our data demonstrate that lipid nanodiscs are amenable to high-resolution structure determination of peripheral membrane proteins and provide a framework for extending this analysis to other systems.",

To overcome this barrier, we revisit SRS from the perspective of energy deposition. The SRS process pumps molecules to their vibrationally excited states. The thereafter relaxation heats up the surrounding and induces refractive index changes. By probing the refractive index changes with a laser beam, we introduce stimulated Raman photothermal (SRP) microscopy, where a >500-fold boost of modulation depth is achieved. Versatile applications of SRP microscopy on viral particles, cells, and tissues are demonstrated.

    "abstract": "Quality Control (QC) of human genome sequencing and exome sequencing data is necessary to ensure they are of sufficient quality for downstream analyses. While several QC tools are available to measure quality parameters at various levels post-sequencing, their output needs to be reviewed and interpreted in a very manual and time-consuming process. Such manual review is a major challenge towards standardization and consistency, as the process can be subjective depending on the reviewer. To address these difficulties, we have developed QuaC, which implements, integrates, and standardizes QC best practices at our Center. It performs three major steps: (1) runs several QC tools using data produced by the read alignment (BAM) and small variant calling (VCF) as input and optionally accepts QC output for raw sequencing reads (FASTQ); (2) executes QuaC-Watch to perform QC checkup based on the expected thresholds for quality metrics; and (3) aggregates QC metrics produced by all the QC tools as well as QuaC-Watch results into single, self-contained MultiQC report, both at the per-sample and across-project levels. This report provides aggregate summaries for all samples within a project/cohort for efficient comprehensive review while still allowing for granular review down to individual metrics for a single sample. Finally, we have developed a \"Sample QC review system\" schema to standardize QC reviewers logging of results and simplify downstream users interpretation of the reviewers finding.",

    "abstract": "The Anopheles symbiont, Microsporidia MB, is maternally inherited and has a strong malaria transmission-blocking phenotype in Anopheles arabiensis. Microsporidia MB is also vertically transmitted, sexually transmitted and avirulent. These characteristics are expected to promote its spread through mosquito populations, enhancing the potential of Microsporidia MB as a candidate for the development of a symbiont-mediated malaria transmission blocking strategy. We found that the patterns of Microsporidia MB localisation over the development of An. arabiensis indicate accumulation in tissues linked to its transmission, specifically the male and female gonadal tissues. Transovarial vertical transmission of Microsporidia MB occurs in the female An. arabiensis ovary when Microsporidia MB becomes localised to the cytoplasm of the developing oocyte. In male An. arabiensis, Microsporidia MB is localised in the testis and vas deferens. Notably, a high intensity of Microsporidia MB can also be observed in the An. arabiensis adult but not larval gut. The levels of Microsporidia MB found in the female ovary are linked to the progression of oogenesis, increasing after blood feeding initiates the development of eggs. The levels of Microsporiodia MB in the male and female gonadal and gut tissue do not increase as mosquitoes age. Altogether, the high specificity of Microsporidia MB tissue localisation patterns and changes in infection prevalence and intensity suggest adaptation to maximise transmission and avirulence in Anopheles arabiensis.\n\nImportanceMicrosporidia MB is a symbiont with strong malaria transmission-blocking phenotype in Anopheles arabiensis. It spreads in mosquito populations through mother-to-offspring and sexual transmission. The ability of Microsporidia MB to block Plasmodium transmission together with its ability to spread within Anopheles populations and its avirulence to the host makes it a very attractive candidate for developing a key strategy to stop malaria transmissions. Here, we report the basis of Microsporidia MB transmission. We find that Microsporidia MB accumulates in Anopheles arabiensis tissues linked to its sexual and vertical transmission. Its prevalence and intensity in the tissues over the mosquito life cycle suggest adaptation to maximise transmission and avirulence in Anopheles arabiensis. These findings provide the foundation for understanding the factors that affect Microsporidia MB transmission efficiency. This will contribute to the establishment of strategies to maximize Microsporidia MB transmission for Anopheles mosquito population replacement and malaria transmission blocking.",

    "abstract": "PDZ protein interacting specifically with Tc10 or PIST is a mammalian trans-Golgi resident protein that regulates subcellular sorting of plasma membrane receptors. PIST has recently been found to play an important role in regulating viral pathogenesis. Alteration in PIST expression is linked to the reprogramming of cell surface receptors which is crucial in determining herpes simplex virus1 infection. In this context, PIST is crucial in triggering autophagy via Beclin 1 -PI3KC3 pathway. However, there is complete lack in our knowledge on the role of this protein in any parasitic infection. Leishmania parasites infect their host macrophage cells via phagocytosis and their survival within the parasitophorous compartment has recently been found to be dependent on host autophagy by a yet to be identified mechanism. Using Leishmania major (L. major)-macrophage infection model system we, for the first-time report here that in infected macrophages Golgi resident PIST protein migrates towards the parasite containing compartment. We have also found that PIST associates with Beclin 1, however, not with LC3 within L. major parasite containing compartment of infected macrophages. Further, we performed genetic ablation of PIST by siRNA and observed that knockdown of macrophage PIST in turn helps in parasite replication. Contrary to this, overexpression of PIST in macrophages restricted the multiplication of L. major. Collectively, our study for the first time reveals that PIST is essential in regulating intracellular parasite, L. major infection within macrophage cells.\n\nSummary StatementMammalian PIST protein plays a crucial role in regulating cellular trafficking events. Here, we showed that PIST status is altered within Leishmania major parasite infected macrophages. Further, we confirmed that PIST is essential in restricting parasite growth.

    "abstract": "Severe defects in cell size are a nearly universal feature of cancer cells. However, the underlying causes are unknown. A previous study suggested that a hyperactive mutant of yeast Ras (ras2G19V) that is analogous to the human Ras oncogene causes cell size defects, which could provide clues to how oncogenes influence cell size. However, the mechanisms by which ras2G19V influences cell size are unknown. Here, we found that ras2G19V inhibits a critical step in cell cycle entry, in which an early G1 phase cyclin induces transcription of late G1 phase cyclins. Thus, ras2G19Vdrives overexpression of the early G1 phase cyclin Cln3, yet Cln3 fails to induce normal transcription of late G1 phase cyclins, leading to delayed cell cycle entry and increased cell size. ras2G19V influences transcription of late G1 cyclins via a poorly understood step in which Cln3 inactivates the Whi5 transcriptional repressor. Previous studies found that Ras relays signals via protein kinase A (PKA) in yeast; however, ras2G19Vappears to influence G1 phase cyclin expression via novel PKA-independent signaling mechanisms. Together, the data define new mechanisms by which hyperactive Ras influences cell cycle entry and cell size in yeast. Expression of G1 phase cyclins is also strongly influenced by mammalian Ras via mechanisms that remain unclear. Therefore, further analysis of PKA-independent Ras signaling in yeast could lead to discovery of conserved mechanisms by which Ras family members control expression of G1 phase cyclins.",

    "abstract": "CARD9, -10, -11 and -14 all belong to the CARD-coiled coil (CC) protein family and originated from a single common ancestral protein early in vertebrate evolution. All four proteins form CARD-CC/BCL10/MALT1 (CBM) complexes leading to NF-{kappa}B activation after upstream phosphorylation by various protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms. CBM complex signaling is critical for innate and adaptive immunity, but aberrant activation can cause autoimmune or autoinflammatory diseases, or be oncogenic. CARD9 shows a superior auto-inhibition with very low spontaneous activity when overexpressed in HEK293T cells. In contrast, the poor auto-inhibition of other CARD-CC family proteins, especially CARD10 (CARMA3) and CARD14 (CARMA2), is hampering characterization of upstream activators or activating mutations in overexpression studies. We grafted different domains from CARD10, -11 and 14 on CARD9 to generate chimeric CARD9 backbones for functional characterization of activating mutants using NF-{kappa}B reporter gene activation in HEK293T cells as readout. CARD11 (CARMA1) activity was not further reduced by grafting on CARD9 backbones. The chimeric CARD9 approach was subsequently validated by using several known disease-associated mutations in CARD10 and CARD14, and additional screening allowed us to identify several novel activating natural variants in human CARD9 and CARD10. Using Genebass as a resource of exome-based disease association statistics, we found that activated alleles of CARD9 correlate with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), constipation, arthritis, fibromyalgia, insomnia, anxiety and depression, which can occur as comorbidities.",

RNA-Seq and digital droplet PCR measurements demonstrated developmentally regulated expression of lncRNAs between intra-mammalian life stages; a similar proportion of lncRNAs (14.2 %) and mRNAs (12.8 %) were differentially expressed (p<0.001), supporting a functional role for lncRNAs in F. hepatica life stages. While most lncRNAs (81%) were intergenic, we identified some that overlapped protein coding loci in antisense (13%) or intronic (6%) configurations. We found no unequivocal evidence for correlated developmental expression within positionally correlated lncRNA:mRNA pairs, but global co-expression analysis identified five lncRNA that were inversely co-regulated with 89 mRNAs, including a large number of functionally essential proteases. The presence of micro (mi)RNA binding sites in 3135 lncRNAs indicates the potential for miRNA-based post-transcriptional regulation of lncRNA, and/or their function as competing endogenous (ce)RNAs. This first description of lncRNAs in F. hepatica provides an avenue to future functional and comparative genomics studies that will provide a new perspective on a poorly understood aspect of parasite biology.",

    "abstract": "Closed spinal dysraphisms are poorly understood neurodevelopmental malformations commonly classed as neural tube defects. Several, including terminal myelocystocele, selectively affect the distal lumbosacral spine. We previously identified a neural tube closure-initiating point, Closure 5, involved in forming the distal spine of mice. Here we document equivalent morphology of the caudal-most end of the closing posterior neuropore (PNP) in mice and humans, suggesting Closure 5 is conserved in humans. It forms in a region of active fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling and pharmacological blockade of FGF receptors (Fgfr) impairs Closure 5 formation in cultured mouse embryos. Conditional genetic deletion of Fgfr1 in caudal embryonic tissues with Cdx2Cre similarly impairs Closure 5 formation and leads to morphologically abnormal PNPs, which nonetheless achieve delayed closure although delayed. After PNP closure, a localised region of the distal neural tube of Fgfr1-disrupted embryos re-opens into a trumpet-like flared central canal between the presumptive hindlimbs, progressing to form a distal fluid-filled sac overlying ventrally flattened spinal cord. This phenotype resembles terminal myelocystocele. Histological analysis of spinal progenitor domains reveals regional and progressive loss of ventral spinal cord progenitor domains preceding cystic dilation of the central canal. Initially, the Shh and FoxA2-positive ventral domains are lost, resulting in Olig2-labelling of the ventral-most neural tube. The Olig2-domain is also subsequently lost, eventually producing a neural tube entirely positive for the dorsal marker Pax3. Thus, a terminal myelocystocele-like phenotype can arise after completion of neural tube closure due to localised spinal mis-patterning caused by disruption of Fgfr1 signalling.",

    "abstract": "Preimplantation stages of mouse embryo development involve temporal and spatial specification and segregation of three late blastocyst cell lineages; trophectoderm (TE), primitive endoderm (PrE) and epiblast (EPI). Spatial separation of the outer TE lineage from the two inner cell mass (ICM) lineages (PrE and EPI) starts with the 8- to 16-cell transition and concludes following transit through the 16- to 32-cell stages. This results in an early blastocyst ICM derived from descendants of primary founding inner cells and a secondarily contributed population, of which subsequent relative EPI versus PrE potencies are subject to debate. Here, we report generation of primary but not the secondary ICM populations is highly dependent on temporally discreet activation of the mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR - specifically mTORC1) during M-phase entry at the 8-cell stage. This role is mediated via regulation of the 7-methylguanosine-(7mG) cap binding initiation complex (EIF4F), linked to translation of a subset of key mRNAs containing 5 UTR terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP-) or TOP-like sequence motifs; as knockdown of identified TOP-like motif containing transcripts also impairs generation of 16-cell stage primary ICM founders. However, mTOR inhibition induced ICM cell number deficits at the early blastocyst stage can be compensated by the late blastocyst stage, in the absence of inhibition. This compensation is likely initiated at the 32-cell stage when supernumerary outer cells in mTOR-inhibited embryos exhibit molecular characteristics of inner cells. Collectively, the data identify a novel mechanism specifically governing initial spatial segregation of blastomeres in the mouse embryo, that is distinct from those directing subsequent inner cell formation and contributes to germane segregation of late blastocyst lineages.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIntermittent theta-burst stimulation (i)(TBS) is a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) plasticity protocol. Conventionally, TBS is applied using biphasic pulses due to hardware limitations. However, monophasic pulses are hypothesised to recruit cortical neurons more selectively than biphasic pulses, thus yielding stronger plasticity effects. Monophasic and biphasic TBS can be generated using a custom-made pulse-width modulation-based TMS device (pTMS).\n\nObjectiveUsing pTMS, we tested the hypothesis that monophasic iTBS would induce greater plasticity effects than biphasic, measured as induced changes in motor corticospinal excitability.\n\nMethodsIn a repeated-measures design, thirty healthy volunteers participated in three separate sessions, where monophasic and biphasic iTBS was applied to the primary motor cortex (M1 condition) or the vertex (control condition). Plasticity was quantified as changes in motor corticospinal excitability after versus before iTBS, by comparing peak-to-peak amplitudes of motor evoked potentials (MEP) measured at baseline and over 60 minutes after iTBS.\n\nResultsBoth monophasic and biphasic M1 iTBS led to significant increases in MEP amplitude. As predicted, monophasic iTBS induced a significantly larger effect than biphasic iTBS (linear mixed effect model analysis: ({chi}2(1) = 7.48, p = 0.006), which persisted even after subtracting each individuals control (vertex) condition data from the M1 conditions ({chi}2(1) = 5.48, p = 0.019).\n\nConclusionsIn this study, monophasic iTBS induced a stronger motor corticospinal excitability increase than biphasic within participants. This greater physiological effect suggests that monophasic iTBS may also have potential for greater functional impact, of interest for future fundamental and clinical applications of TBS.",

Noradrenaline is a powerful neuromodulator involved in the regulation of excitability and plasticity of large-scale brain networks. In this study, we assessed the activity of locus coeruleus neurons and changes in noradrenergic transmission during acute hippocampal seizures evoked with perforant path stimulation. LC neurons were recorded in anesthetized rats using a multichannel electrophysiology probe and were identified based on electrophysiological characteristics or optogenetic tagging. The majority of LC neurons (55%) were inhibited during seizures, while only a subset of LC neurons (28%) was excited during seizures. Topographic analysis of multi-unit activity showed anatomical separation of neurons that were excited and inhibited during seizures. Changes in hippocampal noradrenaline transmission during seizures were assessed using a fluorescent biosensor for noradrenaline, GRABNE2m, in combination with fiber photometry in both anesthetized and awake rats. Our results indicate that acute electrically evoked hippocampal seizures are associated with strong changes in LC unit activity and strong and consistent time-locked release of noradrenaline.

    "abstract": "Infection with Influenza A virus (IAV) causes the well-known symptoms of the flu, including fever, loss of appetite and excessive sleepiness. These responses, mediated by the brain, will normally disappear once the virus is cleared from the system, but a severe respiratory virus infection may cause long-lasting neurological disturbances. These include encephalitis lethargica and narcolepsy. The mechanisms behind such long lasting changes are unknown. The hypothalamus is a central regulator of the homeostatic response during a viral challenge. To gain insight into the neuronal and non-neuronal molecular changes during an IAV infection, we intranasally infected mice with an H1N1 virus and extracted the brain at different time points. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of the hypothalamus, we identify transcriptional effects in all identified cell populations. The snRNA-seq data showed the most pronounced transcriptional response at 3 days past infection, with a strong downregulation of genes across all cell types. General immune processes were mainly impacted in microglia, the brain resident immune cells, where we found increased numbers of cells expressing pro-inflammatory gene networks. In addition, we found that most neuronal cell populations downregulated genes contributing to the energy homeostasis in mitochondria and protein translation in the cytosol, indicating potential reduced cellular and neuronal activity. This might be a preventive mechanism in neuronal cells to avoid intracellular viral replication and attack by phagocytosing cells. The change of microglia gene activity suggest that this is complemented by a shift in microglia activity to provide increased surveillance of their surroundings.",

    "abstract": "During observation of the ambiguous Necker cube, our perception suddenly reverses between two about equally possible 3D interpretations. During passive observation, perceptual reversals seem to be sudden and spontaneous. A number of theoretical approaches postulate destabilization of neural representations as a precondition for spontaneous reversals of ambiguous figures. In the current study, we focused on possible EEG correlates of perceptual destabilization, that may allow to predict an upcoming perceptual reversal.\n\nWe presented ambiguous Necker cube stimuli in an onset-paradigm and investigated the neural processes underlying endogenous reversals as compared to perceptual stability across two consecutive stimulus presentations. In a separate experimental condition, disambiguated cube variants were alternated randomly, to exogenously induce perceptual reversals. We compared the EEG immediately before and during endogenous Necker cube reversals with corresponding time windows during exogenously induced perceptual reversals of disambiguated cube variants.\n\nFor the ambiguous Necker cube stimuli, we found the earliest differences in the EEG between reversal trials and stability trials already one second before a reversal occurred, at bilateral parietal electrodes. The traces remained similar until approximately 1100 ms before a perceived reversal, became maximally different at around 890 ms (p=7.59*10-6, Cohens d=1.35) and remained different until shortly before offset of the stimulus preceding the reversal. No such patterns were found in the case of disambiguated cube variants.\n\nThe identified EEG effects may reflect destabilized states of neural representations, related to destabilized perceptual states preceding a perceptual reversal. They further indicate that spontaneous Necker cube reversals are most probably not as spontaneous as generally thought. Rather, the destabilization may occur over a longer time scale, at least one second before a reversal event.",

    "abstract": "In mammalian brains, tens of millions to billions of cells form complex interaction networks to enable a wide range of functions. The enormous diversity and intricate organization of cells in the brain have so far hindered our understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of its functions. Recent advances in spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomics have allowed systematic mapping of the spatial organization of molecularly defined cell types in complex tissues1-3. However, these approaches have only been applied to a few brain regions1-11 and a comprehensive cell atlas of the whole brain is still missing. Here, we imaged a panel of >1,100 genes in [~]8 million cells across the entire adult mouse brain using multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH)12 and performed spatially resolved, single-cell expression profiling at the whole-transcriptome scale by integrating MERFISH and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Using this approach, we generated a comprehensive cell atlas of >5,000 transcriptionally distinct cell clusters, belonging to [~]300 major cell types, in the whole mouse brain with high molecular and spatial resolution. Registration of the MERFISH images to the common coordinate framework (CCF) of the mouse brain further allowed systematic quantifications of the cell composition and organization in individual brain regions defined in the CCF. We further identified spatial modules characterized by distinct cell-type compositions and spatial gradients featuring gradual changes in the gene-expression profiles of cells. Finally, this high-resolution spatial map of cells, with a transcriptome-wide expression profile associated with each cell, allowed us to infer cell-type-specific interactions between several hundred pairs of molecularly defined cell types and predict potential molecular (ligand-receptor) basis and functional implications of these cell-cell interactions. These results provide rich insights into the molecular and cellular architecture of the brain and a valuable resource for future functional investigations of neural circuits and their dysfunction in diseases.",

However, the relationship between chromatin mobility and other genomic processes remains unclear. Hence, we set out to label the DNA directly in a sequence unbiased manner and followed labeled chromatin dynamics in interphase human cells expressing GFP-tagged PCNA, a cell cycle marker and core component of the DNA replication machinery. We detected decreased chromatin mobility during the S-phase compared to G1 and G2 phases in tumor as well as normal diploid cells using automated particle tracking. To gain insight into the dynamical organization of the genome during DNA replication, we determined labeled chromatin domain sizes and analyzed their motion in replicating cells. By correlating chromatin mobility proximal to the active sites of DNA synthesis, we showed that chromatin motion was locally constrained at the sites of DNA replication. Furthermore, inhibiting DNA synthesis led to increased loading of DNA polymerases. This was accompanied by accumulation of the single-stranded DNA binding protein on the chromatin and activation of DNA helicases further restricting local chromatin motion. We, therefore, propose that it is the loading of replisomes but not their catalytic activity that reduces the dynamics of replicating chromatin segments in the S-phase as well as their accessibility and probability of interactions with other genomic regions.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=76 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/531331v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ed9743org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@65c9d4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a583a7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6681b1_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Highlights- Direct and sequence unbiased labeling of DNA genome-wide\n- DNA labeled chromatin is more mobile in G1/G2 relative to the S-phase\n- Restriction of chromatin motion occurs proximal to sites of DNA replication\n- Loading of replisomes, even in the absence of processive DNA synthesis, restricts chromatin motion",

Mechanistically, Bsc2 LD targeting requires TG, and LD targeting is mediated by hydrophobic regions (HRs). Molecular dynamics simulations reveal these Bsc2 HRs interact with TG on modeled LDs, and adopt specific conformations on TG-rich LDs versus SE-rich LDs or an ER bilayer. Bsc2-deficient yeast display no defect in LD biogenesis, but exhibit elevated TG lipolysis dependent on lipase Tgl3. Remarkably, Bsc2 abundance influences TG, and over-expression of Bsc2, but not LD protein Pln1, promotes TG accumulation without altering SE. Finally, we find Bsc2-deficient cells display altered LD mobilization during stationary growth. We propose Bsc2 regulates lipolysis and localizes to subsets of TG-enriched LDs.",

Here we found that cells respond to high H2O2 levels in two temporal phases. In the first phase FOXO1 rapidly shuttles to the nucleus while p53 levels remain low. In the second phase FOXO1 exits the nucleus and p53 levels rise. We found that other oxidative stress induced TFs are activated in the first phase with FOXO1 (NF-kB, NFAT1), or the second phase with p53 (NRF2, JUN) but not both following H2O2 stress.

Since Atp2a2 knockout mice do not phenocopy its pathology, we established a human tissue model of Darier disease to elucidate its pathogenesis and identify potential therapies. Leveraging CRISPR/Cas9, we generated human keratinocytes lacking SERCA2, which replicated features of Darier disease, including weakened intercellular adhesion and defective differentiation in organotypic epidermis. To identify pathogenic drivers downstream of SERCA2 depletion, we performed RNA sequencing and proteomic analysis. SERCA2-deficient keratinocytes lacked desmosomal and cytoskeletal proteins required for epidermal integrity and exhibited excess MAP kinase signaling, which modulates keratinocyte adhesion and differentiation. Immunostaining patient biopsies substantiated these findings with lesions showing keratin deficiency, cadherin mis-localization, and ERK hyper-phosphorylation. Dampening ERK activity with MEK inhibitors rescued adhesive protein expression and restored keratinocyte sheet integrity despite SERCA2 depletion or chemical inhibition. In sum, coupling multi-omic analysis with human organotypic epidermis as a pre-clinical model, we found that SERCA2 haploinsufficiency disrupts critical adhesive components in keratinocytes via ERK signaling and identified MEK inhibition as a treatment strategy for Darier disease.",

    "abstract": "The last decade witnesses the emergence of the abundant family of smORF peptides, encoded by small ORF (<100 codons), whose biological functions remain largely unexplored. Bioinformatic analyses here identify hundreds of putative smORF peptides expressed in Drosophila imaginal leg discs. Thanks to a functional screen in legs, we found smORF peptides involved in morphogenesis, including the pioneer smORF peptides Pri. Since we identified its target Ubr3 in the epidermis and pri was known to control leg development through misunderstood mechanisms, we investigated the role of Ubr3 in mediating pri function in legs. We found that pri play several roles during leg development both in patterning and in cell survival. At larval pupal transition, Pri peptides cooperate with Ubr3 to insure cell survival and leg morphogenesis. Earlier, during larval stage, pri activates independently of Ubr3 tarsal transcriptional programs and Notch and EGFR signalling pathways. Our results highlight Ubr3 dependent and independent functions of Pri peptides and their pleiotropy. Moreover, we reveal that the smORF peptide family is a reservoir of overlooked developmental regulators, displaying distinct molecular functions and orchestrating leg development.\n\nSummary statementPri smORF peptides activate multiple actors regulating signalling pathways, transcription and apoptosis by distinct mechanisms to insure tarsal patterning and epithelial morphogenesis during leg development.",

This atlas offers high-resolution and in-depth molecular insights into zebrafish development, achieved through the sequencing of individual embryos across ten developmental stages, complemented by trajectory reconstructions. Zebrahub also incorporates an interactive tool to navigate the complex cellular flows and lineages derived from light-sheet microscopy data, enabling in silico fate mapping experiments.

Although stem cells from embryonic and extraembryonic origins have been generated for several mammalian species(Bogliotti et al., 2018; Choi et al., 2019; Cui et al., 2019; Evans and Kaufman, 1981; Kunath et al., 2005; Li et al., 2008; Martin, 1981; Okae et al., 2018; Tanaka et al., 1998; Thomson et al., 1998; Vandevoort et al., 2007; Vilarino et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2021b; Zhong et al., 2018), they are grown in different culture conditions with diverse media composition, which makes it difficult to study cross-lineage communication. Here, by using the same culture condition that activates FGF, TGF-{beta} and WNT signaling pathways, we derived stable embryonic stem cells (ESCs), extraembryonic endoderm stem cells (XENs) and trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) from all three founding tissues of mouse and cynomolgus monkey blastocysts. This allowed us to establish embryonic and extraembryonic stem cell co-cultures to dissect lineage crosstalk during early mammalian development. Co-cultures of ESCs and XENs uncovered a conserved and previously unrecognized growth inhibition of pluripotent cells by extraembryonic endoderm cells, which is in part mediated through extracellular matrix signaling. Our study unveils a more universal state of stem cell self-renewal stabilized by activation, as opposed to inhibition, of developmental signaling pathways. The embryonic and extraembryonic stem cell co-culture strategy developed here will open new avenues for creating more faithful embryo models and developing more developmentally relevant differentiation protocols.",

    "abstract": "Dermal Fibroblast Progenitors (DFPs) differentiate into distinct fibroblast lineages during skin development. However, the mechanisms that regulate lineage commitment of naive dermal progenitors to form niches around the hair follicle, dermis, and hypodermis, are unknown. In our study, we used multimodal single-cell approaches, epigenetic assays, and allografting techniques to define a DFP state and the mechanisms that govern its differentiation potential. Our results indicate that the overall chromatin profile of DFPs is repressed by H3K27me3 and has inaccessible chromatin at lineage specific genes. Surprisingly, the repressed chromatin profile of DFPs renders them unable to reform skin in allograft assays despite their multipotent potential. Distinct fibroblast lineages, such as the dermal papilla and adipocytes contained specific chromatin profiles that were de-repressed during late embryogenesis by the H3K27-me3 demethylase, Kdm6b/Jmjd3. Tissue-specific deletion of Kdm6b/Jmjd3 resulted in ablating the adipocyte compartment and inhibiting mature dermal papilla functions in single-cell-RNA-seq, ChIPseq, and allografting assays. Altogether our studies reveal a mechanistic multimodal understanding of how DFPs differentiate into distinct fibroblast lineages, and we provide a novel multiomics search-tool within skinregeneration.org.",

    "abstract": "Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is a key regulator of reproductive function in vertebrates. GnRH is related to the corazonin (CRZ) neuropeptide which influences metabolism and stress responses in insects. Recent evidence suggests that GnRH and CRZ are paralogous and arose by a gene duplication in a common ancestor of bilaterians. Here we report the identification and complete characterization of the GnRH and CRZ signaling systems in the amphioxus Branchiostoma floridae. We have identified a novel GnRH peptide (YSYSYGFAP-NH2) that specifically activates two GnRH receptors and a CRZ peptide (FTYTHTW-NH2) that activates three CRZ receptors in B. floridae. The latter appear to be promiscuous, as two CRZ receptors can also be activated by GnRH in the physiological range. Hence, there is a potential for cross-talk between these closely-related signaling systems. Discovery of both the GnRH and CRZ signaling systems in one of the closest-living relatives of vertebrates provides a framework to discover their roles at the transition from invertebrates to vertebrates.\n\nSignificanceIdentifying neuropeptides and resolving the relationships of neuropeptides across different phyla is challenging due to their short sequences. Here we resolve a controversy regarding the identities and evolutionary relationships of a family of homologous neuropeptides that include the well-known human reproductive hormone gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and insect stress hormone corazonin (CRZ). We have discovered bona fide GnRH and CRZ signaling systems in Branchiostoma which provides a basis for investigating the evolution of the physiological roles of these neuropeptides in one of the closest living relatives of vertebrates.",

    "abstract": "The establishment and spread of anti-malarial drug resistance vary drastically across different biogeographic regions. Though most infections occur in Sub-Saharan Africa, resistant strains often emerge in low-transmission regions. Existing models on resistance evolution lack consensus on the relationship between transmission intensity and drug resistance, possibly due to overlooking the feedback between antigenic diversity, host immunity, and selection for resistance. To address this, we developed a novel compartmental model that tracks sensitive and resistant parasite strains, as well as the host dynamics of generalized and antigen-specific immunity. Our results show a negative correlation between parasite prevalence and resistance frequency, regardless of resistance cost or efficacy. Validation using chloroquine-resistant marker data supports this trend. Post discontinuation of drugs, resistance remains high in low-diversity, low-transmission regions, while it steadily decreases in high-diversity, high-transmission regions. Our study underscores the critical role of malaria strain diversity in the biogeographic patterns of resistance evolution.",

    "abstract": "Studies of species that experience environmental heterogeneity across their distributions have become an important tool for understanding mechanisms of adaptation and predicting responses to climate change. We examine population structure, demographic history, and environmentally associated genomic variation in Bombus vosnesenskii, a common bumble bee in the western U.S.A., using whole genome resequencing of populations distributed across a broad range of latitudes and elevations. We find that B. vosnesenskii exhibits minimal population structure and weak isolation by distance, confirming results from previous studies using other molecular marker types. Similarly, demographic analyses with Sequentially Markovian Coalescent (SMC) models suggest that minimal population structure may have persisted since the last interglacial period, with genomes from different parts of the species range showing similar historical effective population size (Ne) trajectories and relatively small fluctuations through time. Redundancy analysis revealed a small amount of genomic variation explained by bioclimatic variables, and environmental association analysis with latent factor mixed modeling (LFMM2) identified few outlier loci that were sparsely distributed throughout the genome. Some outlier loci were in genes with known regulatory relationships, suggesting the possibility of weak selection, although compared to other species examined with similar approaches, evidence for extensive local adaptation signatures in the genome was relatively weak. Overall, results indicate Bombus vosnesenskii is an example of a generalist with a high degree of flexibility in its environmental requirements that may ultimately benefit the species under periods of climate change.",

    "abstract": "Enhanced sampling techniques have revolutionised molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, enabling the study of rare events and the calculation of free energy differences in complex systems. One of the main families of enhanced sampling techniques uses physical degrees of freedom called collective variables (CVs) to accelerate a systems dynamics and recover the original systems statistics. However, encoding all the relevant degrees of freedom in a limited number of CVs is challenging, particularly in large biophysical systems. Another category of techniques, such as parallel tempering, simulates multiple replicas of the system in parallel, with-out requiring CVs. However, these methods may explore less relevant high-energy portions of the phase space and become computationally expensive for large systems. To overcome the limitations of both approaches, we propose a replica exchange method called OneOPES that combines the power of multi-replica simulations and CV-based enhanced sampling. This method efficiently accelerates the phase space sampling without the need for ideal CVs, extensive parameters fine tuning nor the use of a large number of replicas, as demonstrated by its successful applications to protein-ligand binding and protein folding benchmark systems. Our approach shows promise as a new direction in the development of enhanced sampling techniques for molecular dynamics simulations, providing an efficient and robust framework for the study of complex and unexplored problems.\n\nTable of Content Graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=104 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/531337v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (24K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@88b5ceorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15817deorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8721bforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b8b314_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Understanding the neural mechanisms that regulate the stress response is critical to know how animals adapt to a changing world and is one of the key factors to be considered for improving animal welfare. Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) is crucial for regulating physiological and endocrine responses, triggering the activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamo - pituitary - adrenal axis (HPA) during stress. In mammals, several telencephalic areas, such as the amygdala and the hippocampus, regulate the autonomic system and the HPA responses. These centers include subpopulations of CRF containing neurons that, by way of CRF receptors, play modulatory roles in the emotional and cognitive aspects of stress. CRF binding protein also plays a role, buffering extracellular CRF and regulating its availability. CRF role in activation of the HPA is evolutionary conserved in vertebrates, highlighting the relevance of this system to help animals cope with adversity. However, knowledge on CRF systems in the avian telencephalon is very limited, and no information exists on detailed expression of CRF receptors and binding protein. Knowing that the stress response changes with age, with important variations during the first week posthatching, the aim of this study was to analyze mRNA expression of CRF, CRF receptors 1 and 2, and CRF binding protein in chicken telencephalon throughout embryonic and early posthatching development, using in situ hybridization. Our results demonstrate an early expression of CRF and its receptors in pallial areas regulating sensory processing, sensorimotor integration and cognition, and a late expression in subpallial areas regulating the stress response. However, CRF buffering system develops earlier in the subpallium than in the pallium. These results help to understand the mechanisms underlying the negative effects of noise and light during prehatching stages in chicken, and suggest that stress regulation becomes more sophisticated with age.",

Neurons with complex karyotypes arise during neurotypical brain development, but neurons are almost never the origin of brain cancers. Instead, somatic mutations in neurons can bring about neurodevelopmental disorders, and contribute to the polygenic landscape of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disease. A subset of human neurons harbors idiosyncratic copy number variants (CNVs, \"CNV neurons\"), but previous analyses of CNV neurons have been limited by relatively small sample sizes. Here, we developed an allele-based validation approach, SCOVAL, to corroborate or reject read-depth based CNV calls in single human neurons. We applied this approach to 2,125 frontal cortical neurons from a neurotypical human brain. This approach identified 226 CNV neurons, as well as a class of CNV neurons with complex karyotypes containing whole or substantial losses on multiple chromosomes. Moreover, we found that CNV location appears to be nonrandom. Recurrent regions of neuronal genome rearrangement contained fewer, but longer, genes.",

    "abstract": "Offspring phenotype at birth is determined by its genotype and the prenatal environment including exposure to maternal hormones. Variation in both maternal glucocorticoids and thyroid hormones can affect offspring phenotype. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms shaping the offspring phenotype, especially those contributing to long-lasting effects, remain unclear. Epigenetic changes (such as DNA methylation) have been postulated as mediators of long-lasting effects of early-life environment. In this study, we determined the effects of elevated prenatal glucocorticoid and thyroid hormones on handling stress response (breath rate), DNA methylation and gene expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GCR) and thyroid hormone receptor (THR) in great tit (Parus major). Eggs were injected before incubation onset with corticosterone (main avian glucocorticoid) and/or thyroid hormones (thyroxine and triiodothyronine) to simulate variation in maternal hormone deposition. Breath rate during handling and gene expression of GCR and THR were evaluated 14 days after hatching. Methylation status of GCR and THR genes were analyzed from the longitudinal blood samples taken 7 and 14 days after hatching, as well as in the following autumn. Elevated prenatal corticosterone level significantly increased the breath rate during handling, indicating enhanced stress response and/or metabolism. Prenatal corticosterone manipulation had CpG-site-specific effects on DNA methylation at the GCR putative promoter region, while it did not significantly affect GCR gene expression. GCR expression was negatively associated with earlier hatching date and chick size. THR methylation or expression did not exhibit any significant relationship with the hormonal treatments or the examined covariates, suggesting that TH signaling may be more robust due to its crucial role in development. This study supports the view that maternal corticosterone may influence offspring metabolism and stress response via epigenetic alterations, yet their possible adaptive role in optimizing offspring phenotype to the prevailing conditions, context-dependency, and the underlying molecular interplay needs further research.",

    "abstract": "To better understand the pattern of primate genome structural variation, we sequenced and assembled using multiple long-read sequencing technologies the genomes of eight nonhuman primate species, including New World monkeys (owl monkey and marmoset), Old World monkey (macaque), Asian apes (orangutan and gibbon), and African ape lineages (gorilla, bonobo, and chimpanzee). Compared to the human genome, we identified 1,338,997 lineage-specific fixed structural variants (SVs) disrupting 1,561 protein-coding genes and 136,932 regulatory elements, including the most complete set of human-specific fixed differences. Across 50 million years of primate evolution, we estimate that 819.47 Mbp or ~27% of the genome has been affected by SVs based on analysis of these primate lineages. We identify 1,607 structurally divergent regions (SDRs) wherein recurrent structural variation contributes to creating SV hotspots where genes are recurrently lost (CARDs, ABCD7, OLAH) and new lineage-specific genes are generated (e.g., CKAP2, NEK5) and have become targets of rapid chromosomal diversification and positive selection (e.g., RGPDs). High-fidelity long-read sequencing has made these dynamic regions of the genome accessible for sequence-level analyses within and between primate species for the first time.",
