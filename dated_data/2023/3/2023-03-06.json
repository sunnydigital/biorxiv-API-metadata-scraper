    "abstract": "Multiple factors explain the proper development of sourdough starters. While the role of raw ingredients and geography, among other things, have been widely studied recently, the possible effect of water chlorination on the overall bacterial communities associated with sourdough remains to be explored. Here, using 16s rRNA amplicon sequencing, we show that water chlorination at levels commonly found in drinking water systems has a limited impact on the overall bacterial communities developing in sourdough starters. However, using targeted sequencing, we found that the abundance of integron 1, a genetic mechanism responsible for the horizontal exchange of antibiotic resistance genes in spoilage and pathogenic bacteria, increased significantly with the level of water chlorination. While our results suggest that water chlorination might not impact sourdough starters at a deep phylogenetic level, they indicate that it can favor the growth of key spoilage bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Axon initial segment (AIS) cell surface proteins mediate key biological processes in neurons including action potential initiation and axo-axonic synapse formation. However, few AIS cell surface proteins have been identified. Here, we used antibody-directed proximity biotinylation to define the cell surface proteins in close proximity to the AIS cell adhesion molecule Neurofascin. To determine the distributions of the identified proteins, we used CRISPR-mediated genome editing for insertion of epitope tags in the endogenous proteins. We found Contactin-1 (Cntn1) among the previously unknown AIS proteins we identified. Cntn1 is enriched at the AIS through interactions with Neurofascin and NrCAM. We further show that Cntn1 contributes to assembly of the AIS-extracellular matrix, and is required for AIS axo-axonic innervation by inhibitory basket cells in the cerebellum and inhibitory chandelier cells in the cortex.",

    "abstract": "The anterior dorsolateral striatum (DLS) is heavily innervated by convergent excitatory projections from the primary motor (M1) and sensory cortex (S1) and is considered an important site of sensorimotor integration. M1 and S1 corticostriatal synapses have functional differences in the strength of their connections with striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) and fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) in the DLS, and as a result exert an opposing influence on sensory-guided behaviors. In the present study, we tested whether M1 and S1 inputs exhibit differences in the subcellular anatomical distribution onto striatal neurons. We injected adeno-associated viral vectors encoding spaghetti monster fluorescent proteins (sm.FPs) into M1 and S1, and used confocal microscopy to generate 3D reconstructions of corticostriatal inputs to single identified SPNs and FSIs obtained through ex-vivo patch-clamp electrophysiology. We found that SPNs are less innervated by S1 compared to M1, but FSIs receive a similar number of inputs from both M1 and S1. In addition, M1 and S1 inputs were distributed similarly across the proximal, medial, and distal regions of SPNs and FSIs. Notably, clusters of inputs were prevalent in SPNs but not FSIs. Our results suggest that SPNs have stronger functional connectivity to M1 compared to S1 due to a higher density of synaptic inputs. The clustering of M1 and S1 inputs onto SPNs but not FSIs suggest that cortical inputs are integrated through cell-type specific mechanisms and more generally have implications for how sensorimotor integration is performed in the striatum.\n\nSignificance StatementThe dorsolateral striatum (DLS) is a key brain area involved in sensorimotor integration due to its dense innervation by the primary motor (M1) and sensory cortex (S1). However, the quantity and anatomical distribution of these inputs to the striatal cell population has not been well characterized. In this study we demonstrate that corticostriatal projections from M1 and S1 differentially innervate spiny projection neurons (SPNs) and fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) in the DLS. S1 inputs innervate SPNs less than M1 and are likely to form synaptic clusters in SPNs but not in FSIs. These findings suggest that sensorimotor integration is partly achieved by differences in the synaptic organization of corticostriatal inputs to local striatal microcircuits.",

    "abstract": "Modern neuroscience has seen the rise of a population-doctrine that represents cognitive variables using geometrical structures in activity space. Representational geometry does not, however, account for how individual neurons implement these representations. Here, leveraging the principle of sparse coding, we present a framework to dissect representational geometry into biologically interpretable components that retain links to single neurons. Applied to extracellular recordings from the primate prefrontal cortex in a working memory task with interference, the identified components revealed disentangled and sequential memory representations including the recovery of memory content after distraction, signals hidden to conventional analyses. Each component was contributed by small subpopulations of neurons with distinct electrophysiological properties and response dynamics. Modelling showed that such sparse implementations are supported by recurrently connected circuits as in prefrontal cortex. The perspective of neuronal implementation links representational geometries to their cellular constituents, providing mechanistic insights into how neural systems encode and process information.",

    "abstract": "The Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability, and the first monogenic cause of Autism Spectrum Disorder. FXS is caused by the absence of the RNA-binding protein FMRP (Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein).\n\nNeuronal migration is an essential step of brain development allowing displacement of neurons from their germinal niches to their final integration site. The precise role of FMRP in neuronal migration remains mostly unexplored. We studied the consequences of FMRP absence on migration, by live-imaging neurons of the postnatal Rostral Migratory Stream (RMS).\n\nIn Fmr1-null RMS, neurons exhibit a slowed-down migration and an impaired trajectory, associated with defects of their centrosomal movement. RNA-interference-induced knockdown of Fmr1 shows that these migratory defects are cell-autonomous. Finally, the FMRP mRNA target involved in these defects is MAP1B (Microtubule-Associated Protein 1B), since its knockdown rescues most migratory defects.\n\nOur results thus unveil a new neurodevelopmental role of FMRP, as a crucial actor of neuronal migration linked to MAP1B, potentially important for the understanding of FXS pathophysiology.",
