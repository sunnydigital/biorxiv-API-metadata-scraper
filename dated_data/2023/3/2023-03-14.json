    "abstract": "Selective autophagy receptors (SARs) are central to cellular homeostatic and organellar recycling pathways. Over the last two decades, more than 30 SARs have been discovered and validated using a variety of experimental approaches ranging from cell biology to biochemistry, including high-throughput imaging and screening methods. Yet, the extent of selective autophagy pathways operating under various cellular contexts e.g., under basal and starvation conditions, remains unresolved. Currently, our knowledge of all known SARs and their associated cargo components is fragmentary and limited by experimental data with varying degrees of resolution. Here, we use classical predictive and modeling approaches to integrate high-quality autophagosome content profiling data with disparate datasets. We identify a global set of potential SARs and their associated cargo components active under basal autophagy, starvation-induced, and proteasome-inhibition conditions. We provide a detailed account of cellular components, biochemical pathways, and molecular processes that are degraded via autophagy. Our analysis yields a catalog of new potential SARs that satisfy the characteristics of bonafide, well-characterized SARs. We categorize them by the subcellular compartments they emerge from and classify them based on their likely mode of action. Our structural modeling validates a large subset of predicted interactions with the human ATG8 family of proteins and shows characteristic, conserved LC3-interacting region (LIR)-LIR-docking site (LDS) and Ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM)-UIM-docking site (UDS) binding modes. Our analysis also revealed the most abundant cargo molecules targeted by these new SARs. Our findings expand the repertoire of SARs and provide unprecedented details into the global autophagic state of HeLa cells. Taken together, our findings provide motivation for the design of new experiments, testing the role of these novel factors in selective autophagy.",

    "abstract": "The liver restores its mass and architecture after injury. Yet, investigating morphogenetic cell behaviours and signals that repair tissue architecture at high spatiotemporal resolution remains challenging. We developed LiverZap, a tuneable chemoptogenetic liver injury model in zebrafish. LiverZap employs formation of a binary FAP-TAP photosensitiser followed by brief near-infrared illumination inducing hepatocyte-specific death and recapitulating mammalian liver injury types. The tool enables local hepatocyte ablation and extended live imaging of regenerative cell behaviours, critical for studying cellular interactions at the interface of healthy and damaged tissue. Applying LiverZap, we show that targeted hepatocyte ablation in a small region-of-interest is unexpectedly sufficient to trigger Liver Progenitor-like Cell (LPC)-mediated regeneration, challenging the current understanding of LPC activation. Associated dynamic bilary network rearrangement and E-cadherin relocalisation suggest modulation of cell adhesion as an integral step of LPC-mediated liver regeneration. This precisely targetable live cell ablation model will enable addressing of key regeneration paradigms.",

    "abstract": "Cell context is key for cell phenotype. Using physiologically relevant models of laminin-rich ECM (lrECM) induction of mammary epithelial cell quiescence and differentiation, we have provided a landscape of the status of key molecular players involved in the proliferation/quiescence decision. Repression of some positive regulators of the cell cycle, such as cyclins and CDKs, occurred already at the mRNA level, whereas negative regulators of the cell cycle, such as Pten and p27, were upregulated only at the protein level. Interestingly, cell cycle arrest occurred despite the active status of Fak, Src and PI3k, because their downstream proliferative signalling pathways were repressed, suggesting the existence of a disconnecting node between upstream and downstream proliferative signalling in quiescent cells. Pten fulfils this role. Inhibition of Pten increased proliferation and restored Akt/mTORC1/2 and Mapk signalling in cells exposed to lrECM. In mice, Pten levels were positively correlated to the basement membrane thickness in the developing mammary epithelia, and Pten localized to the apicolateral membrane of luminal cells both in in ducts and near the nascent lumen in terminal end bud, characteristics consistent with a role for Pten in inducing and sustaining quiescence and tissue architecture. Accordingly, in 3D acininogenesis models, Pten was required for the onset and maintenance of quiescence, cell polarity and lumen assembly. The notion that lrECM-triggered differentiation involves a signalling circuitry with many layers of regulation provides an explanation for the resilience of quiescence within a growth-suppressive microenvironment, and that perturbations in master regulators, such as Pten, could disrupt the quiescent phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Mast cells are infamous for mediating allergic and inflammatory diseases due to their capacity of rapidly releasing a wide range of inflammatory mediators stored in cytoplasmic granules. However, mast cells also have several important physiological roles that involves selective and agonist-specific release of these active mediators. Whilst a filtering mechanism at the plasma membrane could regulate selective release of some cargo, the plethora of stored cargo and the diversity of mast cell functions suggests the existence of granule subtypes with distinct trafficking pathways. The molecular mechanisms underlying differential trafficking and exocytosis of these granules are not known, neither is it clear how granule trafficking is coupled to the stimulus. In endothelial cells, a Rab GTPase, Rab46, responds to histamine but not thrombin signals, and this regulates the trafficking of a subpopulation of endothelial-specific granules. Here, we sought to explore if Rab46 has a similar function in mast cells. We demonstrate, for the first time, that Rab46 is highly expressed in human and murine mast cells and Rab46 genetic deletion has an effect on mast cell degranulation that depends on both stimuli and mast cell developmental stage. Rab46 could therefore be an important regulator of stimuli-coupled responses in mast cells and future studies will seek to understand these mechanisms in order to develop novel and specific therapeutic targets for treatment of the diverse pathologies mediated by mast cells.",

In epithelial tissues that are patterned by morphogen gradients, the emerging patterns achieve levels of precision that have recently been explained by a simple one-dimensional reaction-diffusion model with kinetic noise. Here, we show that patterning precision is even greater if transverse diffusion effects are at play in such tissues. The positional error, a measure for spatial patterning accuracy, decreases in wider tissues but then saturates beyond a width of about ten cells. This demonstrates that the precision of gradient-based patterning in two- or higher-dimensional systems can be even greater than predicted by 1D models, and further attests to the potential of noisy morphogen gradients for high-precision tissue patterning.",

    "abstract": "As the Arctic continues to warm, woody shrubs are expected to expand northward. This process, known as \"shrubification\", has important implications for regional biodiversity, food web structure, and high-latitude temperature amplification. While the future rate of shrubification remains poorly constrained, past records of plant immigration to newly deglaciated landscapes in the Arctic may serve as useful analogues. We provide one new postglacial Holocene sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) record of vascular plants from Iceland and place a second Iceland postglacial sedaDNA record on an improved geochronology; both show Salicaceae present shortly after deglaciation whereas Betulaceae first appears more than 1000 years later. We find a similar pattern of delayed Betulaceae colonization in eight previously published postglacial sedaDNA records from across the glaciated circum North Atlantic. In nearly all cases, we find that Salicaceae colonizes earlier than Betulaceae and that Betulaceae colonization is increasingly delayed for locations farther from glacial-age woody plant refugia. These trends in Salicaceae and Betulaceae colonization are consistent with the plant families environmental tolerances, species diversity, reproductive strategies, seed sizes, and soil preferences. As these reconstructions capture the efficiency of postglacial vascular plant migration during a past period of high-latitude warming, a similarly slow response of some woody shrubs to current warming in glaciated regions, and possibly non-glaciated tundra, may delay Arctic shrubification and future changes in the structure of tundra ecosystems and temperature amplification.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic analyses suggest that self-compatible lineages have higher speciation rates than self-incompatible lineages. However, the effects of selfing on speciation remain unclear. Although a selfing population can resist gene flow from other populations, selfing may increase gene flow from a focal population to other populations. This study investigates the effects of selfing rates of two populations on the waiting time to speciation through the accumulation of Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities (DMI). Generally, a higher mean selfing rate of two populations facilitates speciation when incompatibility-controlling alleles are recessive and are weakly selected, and when gene flow is mainly through pollen dispersal instead of seed dispersal. However, the selfing rate difference between two populations can retard speciation, especially when the selfing rate of immigrants remains unchanged after migration. When the selfing rates of two populations differ, speciation may be fastest when the mean selfing rate is intermediate. Given that selfing rates often vary among conspecific populations in plant species, the results indicate that lineages with higher mean selfing rates may not necessarily have higher rates of speciation through the accumulation of DMI, and also call for an estimation of the dependency of speciation rates on selfing rates.",

    "abstract": "Angiosperms have a complex history of whole-genome duplications (WGDs), with varying numbers and ages of WGD events across clades. These WGDs have greatly affected the composition of plant genomes due to the biased retention of genes belonging to certain functional categories following their duplication. In particular, regulatory genes and genes encoding proteins that act in multiprotein complexes have been retained in excess following WGD. Here, we inferred protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and gene regulatory networks (GRNs) for seven well-characterized angiosperm species and explored the impact of both WGD and small-scale duplications (SSD) in network topology by analyzing changes in frequency of network motifs. We found that PPI networks are enriched in WGD-derived genes associated with dosage-sensitive intricate systems, and strong selection pressures constrain the divergence of WGD-derived genes at the sequence and PPI levels. WGD-derived genes in network motifs are mostly associated with dosage-sensitive processes, such as regulation of transcription and cell cycle, translation, photosynthesis, and carbon metabolism, while SSD-derived genes in motifs are associated with response to biotic and abiotic stress. Recent polyploids have higher motif frequencies than ancient polyploids, while WGD-derived network motifs tend to be disrupted on the longer term. Our findings demonstrate that both WGD and SSD have contributed to the evolution of angiosperm GRNs, but in different ways, with WGD events likely having a more significant impact on the short-term evolution of polyploids.",

    "abstract": "With the development of single-cell technology, many cell traits (e.g. gene expression, chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation) can be measured. Furthermore, the multi-omic profiling technology could jointly measure two or more traits in a single cell simultaneously. In order to process the various data accumulated rapidly, computational methods for multimodal data integration are needed. Previously, we developed inClust, a flexible all-in deep generative framework for transcriptome data. Here, we extend the applicability of inClust into the realm of multimodal data by adding two mask modules: an input-mask module in front of the encoder and an output-mask module behind the decoder. We call this augmented model inClust+, and apply it to various multimodal data. InClust+ was first used to integrate scRNA and MERFISH data from similar cell populations and to impute MERFISH data based on scRNA data. Then, inClust+ is shown to have the capability to integrate a multimodal data contain scRNA and scATAC or two multimodal CITE datasets with batch effect. Finally, inClust+ is used to integrate a monomodal scRNA dataset and two multimodal CITE datasets, and generate the missing modality of surface protein in monomodal scRNA data. In the above examples, the performance of inClust+ is better than or comparable to the most recent tools to the corresponding task, which prove inClust+ is a suitable framework for handling multimodal data. Meanwhile, the successful implementation of mask in inClust+ means that it can be applied to other deep learning methods with similar encoder-decoder architecture to broaden the application scope of these models.",

    "abstract": "We explored the dysregulation of GPCR ligand signaling systems in cancer transcriptomics datasets to uncover new therapeutics opportunities in oncology. We derived a network of interacting ligands and biosynthetic enzymes of organic ligands to infer extracellular activation processes, which we combined with cognate GPCRs and downstream effectors to predict GPCR signaling pathway activation. We found multiple GPCRs that are differentially regulated together with their ligands across cancers and revealed a widespread perturbation of these signaling axes in specific cancer molecular subtypes. We showed that biosynthetic pathway enrichment from enzyme expression recapitulated pathway activity signatures from metabolomics datasets, therefore providing valuable surrogate information for GPCRs responding to organic ligand systems. The expression of several GPCRs signaling components was significantly associated with patient survival in a cancer subtype specific fashion. In particular, the expression of both receptor-ligand, as well as receptor-biosynthetic enzymes interaction partners improved the stratification of patients based on survival, suggesting a potential synergistic role for the activation of specific GPCR networks in modulating cancer phenotypes. Remarkably, we identified many receptor-ligand or enzyme pairs to be significantly associated with patient survival across several cancer molecular subtypes. Furthermore, we found that GPCRs from these actionable axes are the targets of multiple drugs displaying anti-growth effects in large, drug repurposing screens in cancer cells. This study provides a comprehensive map of GPCR signaling axes that can be exploited as actionable targets for personalized cancer treatments.

Unbiased genomic analysis revealed that right-sided colorectal tumors with poorer prognosis are preferentially populated with species related to Escherichia coli, including strains that are producing colibactin. By applying metabolomic profiling in situ, the presence of colibactin-producing Escherichia coli (CoPEC) was identified to establish a high-glycerophospholipid microenvironment within right-sided colorectal tumors that are bearing mutations in either APC or KRAS. Using spatial approaches, we revealed that bacterial microniches are poorly infiltrated with CD8+ T cells.

    "abstract": "Physical activity is an integral part of every mammals daily life, and as a driver of Darwinian fitness, required coordinated evolution of the body and brain. The decision to engage in physical activity is driven either by survival needs or by motivation for the rewarding qualities of physical activity itself. Rodents exhibit innate and learned motivation for voluntary wheel running, and over time run longer and farther, reflecting increased incentive salience and motivation for this consummatory behavior. Dynamic coordination of neural and somatic physiology are necessary to ensure the ability to perform behaviors that are motivationally variable. Hippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) have evolved both cognitive and metabolic functions, which in modern mammals may facilitate body-brain coordination. To determine if SWRs encode aspects of exercise motivation we monitored hippocampal CA1 SWRs and running behaviors in adult mice, while manipulating the incentive salience of the running experience. During non-REM (NREM) sleep, the duration of SWRs before (but not after) running positively correlated with future running duration, and larger pyramidal cell assemblies were activated in longer SWRs, suggesting that the CA1 network encodes exercise motivation at the level of neuronal spiking dynamics. Inter-Ripple-intervals (IRI) before but not after running were negatively correlated with running duration, reflecting more SWR bursting, which increases with learning. In contrast, SWR rates before and after running were positively correlated with running duration, potentially reflecting a tuning of metabolic demand for that days anticipated and actual energy expenditure rather than motivation. These results suggest a novel role for CA1 in exercise behaviors and specifically that cell assembly activity during SWRs encodes motivation for anticipated physical activity.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTDarwinian fitness is increased by body-brain coordination through internally generated motivation, though neural substrates are poorly understood. Specific hippocampal rhythms (i.e., CA1 SWRs), which have a well-established role in reward learning, action planning and memory consolidation, have also been shown to modulate systemic [glucose]. Using a mouse model of voluntary physical activity that requires body-brain coordination, we monitored SWR dynamics when animals were highly motivated and anticipated rewarding exercise (i.e., when body-brain coordination is of heightened importance). We found that during non-REM sleep before exercise, SWR dynamics (which reflect cognitive and metabolic functions) were correlated with future time spent exercising. This suggests that SWRs support cognitive and metabolic facets that motivate behavior by coordinating the body and brain.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence indicates transient beta bursts play an important role in the representation of temporal information and prediction. However, the role of beta bursts in sensorimotor synchronization (SMS) involving active interactions between motor and sensory systems to synchronize predictive movements to periodic events remains unclear. To answer this question, 15 participants were invited to complete a finger-tapping task whilst high-density EEG (128 channels) was recorded. Participants tapped with their right index finger in synchrony with 1 Hz and 0.5 Hz tone trains. In line with previous findings, we found a negative mean asynchrony between tone and tap time, i.e., taps preceded tones for both tone frequencies (1 and 0.5 Hz). In the EEG data, beta bursts were detected and their timing in relationship with tapping and auditory tracking was examined. Results revealed that beta bursts tracked tapping and were modulated by the low frequency phase of the tone frequency (i.e., 1 Hz or 0.5 Hz). Importantly, the locking of beta bursts to the phase of auditory tracking correlated with the behavioural variance on a single trial level that occurred while tapping to the tones. These results demonstrate a critical role for an interplay between beta bursts and low frequency phase in coordinating rhythmic behaviour.",

    "abstract": "We examined the extent to which intentionally underperforming a goal-directed reaching task impacts how memories of recent performance contribute to sensorimotor adaptation. Healthy human subjects performed computerized cognition testing and an assessment of sensorimotor adaptation wherein they grasped the handle of a horizontal planar robot while making goal-directed out-and-back reaching movements. The robot exerted forces that resisted hand motion with a spring-like load that changed unpredictably between movements. The robotic test assessed how implicit and explicit memories of sensorimotor performance contribute to the compensation for the unpredictable changes in the hand-held load. After each movement, subjects were to recall and report peak movement extent from the previous trial. Subjects performed the tests under two counterbalanced conditions: one where they performed with their best effort, and one where they intentionally suppressed performance. Results from the computerized cognition tests confirmed that subjects understood and complied with task instructions. When suppressing performance during the robotic assessment, subjects demonstrated marked changes in reach precision, time to capture the target, and reaction time. We fit a set of limited memory models to the data to identify how subjects used implicit and explicit memories of recent performance to compensate for the changing loads. In both sessions, subjects used implicit, but not explicit, memories from the most recent trial to adapt reaches to unpredictable spring-like loads. Subjects did not \"give up\" on large errors, nor did they discount small errors deemed \"good enough.\" Although subjects clearly suppressed kinematic performance (response timing, movement variability, and self-reporting of reach error), the relative contributions of sensorimotor memories to trial-by-trial variations in task performance did not differ significantly between the two testing conditions. We conclude that intentional performance suppression had minimal impact on how implicit sensorimotor memories contribute to adaptation of unpredictable mechanical loads applied to the hand.",

However, the archetype dynamic trajectories of the neurodegenerative process, even prior to clinical diagnosis, remain unknown.\n\nMethodsWe modeled the volumetric trajectories of brain structures across the entire lifespan using 40944 subjects (38295 healthy controls and 2649 MS patients). Then, we estimated the chronological progression of MS by assessing the divergence of lifespan trajectories between normal brain charts and MS brain charts.\n\nResultsChronologically, the first affected structure was the thalamus, then the putamen and the pallidum (3 years later), followed by the ventral diencephalon (7 years after thalamus) and finally the brainstem (9 years after thalamus). To a lesser extent, the anterior cingulate gyrus, insular cortex, occipital pole, caudate and hippocampus were impacted. Finally, the precuneus and accumbens nuclei exhibited a limited atrophy pattern.\n\nConclusionSubcortical atrophy was more pronounced than cortical atrophy. The thalamus was the most impacted structure with a very early divergence in life.

    "abstract": "Although magnetic field exposure is a well-established diagnostic tool, its use as a therapeutic in regenerative medicine is relatively new. Our goal here was to evaluate how magnetic fields affect neural repair in vitro by performing a systematic review of the literature, mathematical modeling, and meta-analyses. The 38 included articles presented with high heterogeneity, representing 13 cell types, magnitudes ranging from 0.0002-10,000 mT, frequencies from 0-150 Hz, and exposure times lasting from one hour to several weeks. Mathematical modeling revealed that increasing magnetic field magnitude increases neural progenitor cell (NPC) viability. For regenerative processes that were not influenced by magnitude, frequency, and time, we integrated data with meta-analyses. Results revealed that magnetic field exposure increases NPC proliferation while decreasing astrocytic differentiation. Collectively, our work identifies neural repair processes that may be most responsive to magnetic field exposure and provides a framework for novel hypothesis and technology development.",

However, to date, there is no equivalent surrogate available for the decrease of neuronal activity (i.e., inhibition). Here, we developed an optogenetic-based biochemical screen in which population neural activities can be controlled by light with single action potential precision, followed by unbiased phosphoproteomic profiling. We identified that the phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (pPDH) inversely correlated with the intensity of action potential firing in primary neurons. In in vivo mouse models, monoclonal antibody-based pPDH immunostaining detected neuronal inhibition across the brain induced by a wide range of factors including general anesthesia, sensory experiences, and natural behaviors. Thus, as an in vivo marker for neuronal inhibition, pPDH can be used together with IEGs or other cell-type markers to profile and identify bi-directional neural dynamics induced by experiences or behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Resting-state fMRI has proven to entail subject-specific signatures that can serve as a fingerprint to identify individuals. Conventional methods are based on building a connectivity matrix based on correlation between the average time course of pairs of brain regions. This approach, first, disregards the exquisite spatial detail manifested by fMRI due to working on average regional activities, second, cannot disentangle correlations associated to cognitive activity and underlying noise, and third, does not account for cortical morphology that spatially constraints function. Here we propose a method to address these shortcomings via leveraging principles from graph signal processing. We build high spatial resolution cortical graphs that encode each individuals cortical morphology and treat region-specific, whole-hemisphere fMRI maps as signals that reside on the graphs. fMRI graph signals are then decomposed using systems of graph spectral kernels to extract structure-informed functional signatures, which are in turn used for fingerprinting. Results on 100 subjects showed the overall superior subject differentiation power of the proposed signatures over the conventional method. Moreover, placement of the signatures within canonical functional brain networks revealed the greater contribution of high-level cognitive networks in subject identification.",

    "abstract": "Ongoing brain activity preceding visual stimulation has been suggested to shape conscious perception. The underlying mechanisms are still under debate, although alpha oscillations have been pointed out as the main explanatory candidate. According to the pulsed-inhibition framework, bouts of functional inhibition arise in each alpha cycle, allowing information to be processed in a pulsatile manner. Consequently, it has been hypothesized that perceptual outcome can be influenced by the specific phase of alpha oscillations prior to the stimulus onset, although empirical findings are controversial. In this study, we aimed to shed light on the role of pre-stimulus alpha oscillations in visual perception. To this end, we recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) activity while participants performed three near-threshold visual detection tasks with different attentional involvement: a no-cue task, a non-informative cue task (50% cue validity), and an informative cue task (100% cue validity). Cluster-based permutation statistics were complemented with Bayesian analyses to test the effect of pre-stimulus oscillatory amplitude and phase on visual awareness. We additionally examined whether these effects differed on trials with low and high oscillatory amplitude, as expected from the pulsed-inhibition theory. Our results show a clear effect of pre-stimulus alpha amplitude on conscious perception, but only when alpha fluctuated spontaneously and was not modulated by attention, supporting the notion that alpha-band power indexes neural excitability. In contrast, we did not find any evidence that pre-stimulus alpha phase influences the perceptual outcome, not even when differentiating between low and high amplitude trials. Furthermore, Bayesian analysis provided moderate evidence in favor of the absence of phase effects. Taken together, our results challenge the central theoretical predictions of the pulsed-inhibition framework, at least for the particular experimental conditions used here.",

    "abstract": "It is crucial to maintain the intracranial pressure (ICP) within the physiological range to ensure proper brain function. The ICP may fluctuate during the light-dark phase cycle, complicating diagnosis and treatment choice in patients with pressure-related disorders. Such ICP fluctuations may originate in circadian or sleep-wake cycle-mediated modulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow dynamics, which in addition could support diurnal regulation of brain waste clearance. Through a combination of patient data and in vivo telemetric pressure measurements in adult male rats, we demonstrated that ICP increases in the dark phase in both species, independently of vascular parameters. This increase aligns with elevated CSF collection in patients and CSF production rate in rats, the latter obtained with the ventriculo-cisternal perfusion assay. The dark-phase increase in CSF secretion in rats was, in part, assigned to increased transport activity of the choroid plexus Na+,K+,2Cl- cotransporter (NKCC1), which is implicated in CSF secretion by this tissue. In conclusion, CSF secretion, and thus ICP, increases in the dark phase in humans and rats, irrespective of their diurnal/nocturnal activity preference, in part due to altered choroid plexus transport activity. Our findings suggest that CSF dynamics are modulated by the circadian rhythm, rather than merely sleep itself.",

This effect persisted after accounting for current depression symptoms and drift rate for neutral faces. Participants with a slower drift rate for angry faces demonstrated increased activations in the bilateral insula, bilateral inferior frontal gyrus and bilateral parietal cortex when viewing angry relative to neutral faces.\n\nConclusionsOur results suggest a persistent attentional bias in the processing of angry faces in individuals with depression in remission, over and above their current depressive symptoms.

Integrating recent experiences into existing memories ensures that memories contain the most recently available information, but how the brain accomplishes this critical process remains unknown. Here we show that in mice, a strong aversive experience drives the offline ensemble reactivation of not only the recent aversive memory but also a neutral memory formed two days prior, linking the fear from the recent aversive memory to the previous neutral memory. We find that fear specifically links retrospectively, but not prospectively, to neutral memories across days. Consistent with prior studies, we find reactivation of the recent aversive memory ensemble during the offline period following learning. However, a strong aversive experience also increases co-reactivation of the aversive and neutral memory ensembles during the offline period. Finally, the expression of fear in the neutral context is associated with reactivation of the shared ensemble between the aversive and neutral memories. Taken together, these results demonstrate that strong aversive experience can drive retrospective memory-linking through the offline co-reactivation of recent memory ensembles with memory ensembles formed days prior, providing a neural mechanism by which memories can be integrated across days.",

    "abstract": "In a constantly changing environment, organisms face the challenge of adapting their behavior by retrieving previous experiences or acquiring new information. Previous research has postulated that this balance between memory generalization and differentiation manifests in a dichotomic manner. When environmental information exceeds a given threshold, activation of a stored representation could initiate retrieval, but below this threshold, a novel event could be encoded with a concomitant remapping of the internal representation in the hippocampus. Here, we examined the hippocampal molecular and neuronal mechanisms underlying retrieval in a cue-degraded environment by combining in vivo electrophysiological recordings and pharmacological manipulations. We developed a memory recognition task that allows a graded decrease in the contextual cues present during retrieval. We found that the manipulation of the number of visual cues was consistent with the activation or not of the contextual memory trace. Retrieval of a specific context memory was reflected by the level of CA3 remapping, demonstrating a clear relationship between remapping and contextual recognition. Also, manipulation of NMDAR activity in the DG-CA3 circuit bidirectionally modulated contextual memory retrieval. The blockade of NMDAR in CA3 impaired recognition in a cue-degraded, but not in a full-cue context, while their activation has the opposite effect. Conversely, blockade of NMDAR in the DG promoted retrieval under an even more cue-degraded environment, while activation had the opposite effect. Our results provide evidence for a flexible interaction between environmental cues and information stored in the hippocampus and give new insights into the biological mechanisms that balance memory encoding and retrieval.",

Symptoms associated with a variety of human pathological conditions ranging from schizophrenia and autism to Huntingtons and Parkinsons disease point toward functional deficits in this projection, but its development is not well understood, making it difficult to investigate how perturbations in development of this circuitry could contribute to pathophysiology. We applied a novel strategy based on Hotspot Analysis to assess the developmental progression of anatomical positioning of prefrontal cortex to striatal projections. Corticostriatal axonal territories established at P7 expand in concert with striatal growth but remain largely unchanged in positioning through adulthood, indicating they are generated by directed, targeted growth and not modified extensively by postnatal experience. Consistent with these findings, corticostriatal synaptogenesis increased steadily from P7 to P56, with no evidence for widescale pruning. As corticostriatal synapse density increased over late postnatal ages, the strength of evoked PFC input onto dorsomedial striatal projection neurons also increased, but spontaneous glutamatergic synaptic activity was stable. Based on its pattern of expression, we asked whether the adhesion protein, Cdh8, influenced this progression. In mice lacking Cdh8 in PFC corticostriatal projection neurons, axon terminal fields in dorsal striatum shifted ventrally. Corticostriatal synaptogenesis was unimpeded, but spontaneous EPSC frequency declined and mice failed to learn to associate an action with an outcome. Collectively these findings show that corticostriatal axons grow to their target zone and are restrained from an early age, do not undergo postnatal synapse pruning as the most dominant models predict, and that a relatively modest shift in terminal arbor positioning and synapse function has an outsized, negative impact on corticostriatal-dependent behavior.",

    "abstract": "To understand how the brain computes, it is important to unravel the relationship between circuit connectivity and function. Previous research has shown that excitatory neurons in layer 2/3 of the primary visual cortex of mice with similar response 5 properties are more likely to form connections. However, technical challenges of combining synaptic connectivity and functional measurements have limited these studies to few, highly local connections. Utilizing the millimeter scale and nanometer resolution of the MICrONS dataset, we studied the connectivity-10 function relationship in excitatory neurons of the mouse visual cortex across interlaminar and interarea projections, assessing connection selectivity at the coarse axon trajectory and fine synaptic formation levels. A digital twin model of this mouse, that accurately predicted responses to arbitrary video 15 stimuli, enabled a comprehensive characterization of the function of neurons. We found that neurons with highly correlated responses to natural videos tended to be connected with each other, not only within the same cortical area but also across multiple layers and visual areas, including feedforward and feed-20 back connections, whereas we did not find that orientation preference predicted connectivity. The digital twin model separated each neurons tuning into a feature component (what the neuron responds to) and a spatial component (where the neurons receptive field is located). We show that the feature, but not the 25 spatial component, predicted which neurons were connected at the fine synaptic scale. Together, our results demonstrate the \"like-to-like\" connectivity rule generalizes to multiple connection types, and the rich MICrONS dataset is suitable to further refine a mechanistic understanding of circuit structure and 30 function.",

    "abstract": "The right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) is a core hub in neural networks associated with reorienting of attention and social cognition. However, it remains unknown whether participants can learn to actively modulate their rTPJ activity via neurofeedback. Here, we explored the feasibility of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based neurofeedback in modulating rTPJ activity and its effect on rTPJ functions such as reorienting of attention and visual perspective taking. In a bidirectional regulation control group design, 50 healthy participants were either reinforced to up- or downregulate rTPJ activation over four days of training.\n\nBoth groups showed an increase in rTPJ activity right from the beginning of the trainingbut only the upregulation group maintained this effect, while the downregulation group showed a decline from the initial rTPJ activation. This suggests a learning effect in the downregulation exclusively, making it challenging to draw definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of rTPJ upregulation training. However, we observed group-specific effects on the behavioral level. We found a significant group x time interaction effect in the performance of the reorienting of attention task and group-specific changes, with decreased reaction times (RTs) in the upregulation group and increased RTs in the downregulation group across all conditions after the neurofeedback training. Those with low baseline performance showed greater improvements. In the perspective-taking task, however, only time effects were observed that were non-group-specific.These findings demonstrate that fNIRS-based neurofeedback is a feasible method to modulate rTPJ functions with preliminary evidence of neurophysiologically specific effects, thus paving the way for future applications of non-invasive rTPJ modulation in neuropsychiatric disorders.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=96 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/532169v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (21K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1061186org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@168b06forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17795forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1215c6e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIthe right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) as a core hub for attentive and socio-cognitive functions is a promising target for neuromodulatory interventions\nC_LIO_LIfirst single-blinded, randomized controlled study demonstrates feasibility and effectiveness of the fNIRS-based neurofeedback training of the rTPJ in healthy adults\nC_LIO_LIsubjects are able to regulate the rTPJ with different learning characteristics\nC_LIO_LIfirst evidence of a neurophysiologically specific effect on stimulus-driven attention\nC_LIO_LIfindings have important implications for clinical translation of neurofeedback interventions targeting the rTPJ\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Beat induction is the cognitive ability that allow humans to listen to a regular pulse in music and move in synchrony with it. Although auditory rhythmic cues are known to induce more consistent synchronization than flashing visual metronomes, this asymmetry can be canceled out by visual moving metronomes. Here, we investigated whether the naturalness of the visual motion or its kinematics could provide a synchronization advantage over flashing metronomes. Subjects tap in sync with visual isochronous metronomes defined by vertically or horizontally accelerating and decelerating motion, either congruent or not with natural gravity, and then continue tapping with no metronome. We found that motion kinematics was the predominant factor determining rhythm synchronization, as accelerating moving metronomes in either cardinal direction produced more precise and predictive tapping than decelerating or flashing conditions. Notably, a Bayesian observer model revealed that error correction during tapping synchronization and regression towards the mean in accuracy during tapping continuation in the absence of external cues are optimal control strategies independently of the moving properties of the visual metronomes. Our results support the notion that accelerating visual metronomes convey a strong sense of beat as seen in the cueing movements of an orchestra director.",

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic impacts can lead to increased temperatures in freshwater environments through thermal effluent and climate change. Thermal preference of aquatic organisms can be modulated by abiotic and biotic factors including environmental temperature. Whether increased temperature during embryogenesis can lead to long-term alterations in thermal preference has not been explicitly tested in native freshwater species. Lake (Coregonus clupeaformis) and round (Prosopium cylindraceum) whitefish were incubated at natural and elevated temperatures until hatching, following which, all groups were moved to common garden conditions (15{degrees}C) during the post-hatching stage. Temperature preference was determined at 8 (Lake whitefish only) and 12-months of age (both species), using a shuttlebox system. Round whitefish preferred a cooler temperature when incubated at 2{degrees}C and 6{degrees}C compared to 0.5{degrees}C. Lake whitefish had similar temperature preferences regardless of age, weight, and incubation temperature. These results reveal that temperature preference in freshwater fish can be programmed during early development, and that round whitefish may be more sensitive to incubation temperature. This study highlights the effects that small increases in temperature caused by anthropogenic impacts may have on cold-adapted freshwater fish.",

The octopuss suckers, staggered along each arm, are employed in a wide range of behaviors. Many of these behaviors, such as foraging in visually occluded spaces, are executed under conditions of limited or absent visual feedback. In coordinating unseen limbs with seemingly infinite degrees of freedom across a variety of adaptive behaviors, the octopus appears to have solved a significant control problem facing the field of soft-bodied robotics. To study the strategies that the octopus uses to find and capture prey within unseen spaces, we designed and 3D printed visually occluded foraging tasks and tracked arm motion as the octopus attempted to find and retrieve a food reward. By varying the location of the food reward within these tasks, we can characterize how the arms and suckers adapt to their environment to find and capture prey. We compared these results to simulated experimental conditions performed by a model octopus arm to isolate the primary mechanisms driving our experimental observations. We found that the octopus relies on a contact-based search strategy that emerges from local sucker coordination to simplify the control of its soft, highly flexible limbs.",

    "abstract": "The survival of animals depends, among other things, on their ability to identify threats in their surrounding environment. Senses such as olfaction, vision and taste play an essential role in sampling their living environment, including microorganisms, some of which are potentially pathogenic. This study focuses on the mechanisms of detection of bacteria by the Drosophila gustatory system. We demonstrate that the peptidoglycan (PGN) that forms the cell wall of bacteria triggers an immediate feeding aversive response when detected by the gustatory system of adult flies. Although we identify ppk23+ and Gr66a+ gustatory neurons as necessary to transduce fly response to PGN, we demonstrate that they play very different roles in the process. Time-controlled functional inactivation and in vivo calcium imaging demonstrate that while ppk23+ neurons are required in the adult flies to directly transduce PGN signal, Gr66a+ neurons must be functional in larvae to allow future adults to become PGN sensitive. Furthermore, the ability of adult flies to respond to bacterial PGN is lost when they hatch from larvae reared under axenic conditions. Recolonization of axenic larvae, but not adults, with a single bacterial species, Lactobacillus brevis, is sufficient to restore the ability of adults to respond to PGN. Our data demonstrate that the genetic and environmental characteristics of the larvae are essential to make the future adults competent to respond to certain sensory stimuli such as PGN.",

These activity patterns are noisy observations of lower-dimensional latent factors and their nonlinear dynamical structure. A major unaddressed challenge is to model this nonlinear structure, but in a manner that allows for flexible inference, whether causally, non-causally, or in the presence of missing neural observations. We address this challenge by developing DFINE, a new neural network that separates the model into dynamic and manifold latent factors, such that the dynamics can be modeled in tractable form. We show that DFINE achieves flexible nonlinear inference across diverse behaviors and brain regions. Further, despite enabling flexible inference unlike prior neural network models of population activity, DFINE also better predicts the behavior and neural activity, and better captures the latent neural manifold structure. DFINE can both enhance future neurotechnology and facilitate investigations across diverse domains of neuroscience.",

    "abstract": "The postnatal neural stem cell (NSC) pool hosts quiescent and activated radial glia-like NSCs contributing to neurogenesis throughout adulthood. However, the underlying regulatory mechanism during the transition from quiescent NSCs to activated NSCs in the postnatal NSC niche is not fully understood. Lipid metabolism and lipid composition play important roles in regulating NSC fate determination. Biological lipid membranes define the individual cellular shape and help maintain cellular organization and are highly heterogenous in structure and there exist diverse microdomains (also known as lipid rafts), which are enriched with sugar molecules, such as glycosphingolipids. An often overlooked but key aspect is that the functional activities of proteins and genes are highly dependent upon their molecular environments. We previously reported that ganglioside GD3 is the predominant species in NSCs and that the reduced postnatal NSC pools are observed in global GD3-synthase knockout (GD3S-KO) mouse brains. The specific roles of GD3 in determining the stage and cell-lineage determination of NSCs remain unclear, since global GD3S-KO mice cannot distinguish if GD3 regulates postnatal neurogenesis or developmental impacts. Here we show that inducible GD3 deletion in postnatal radial glia-like NSCs promotes the NSC activation, resulting in the loss of the long-term maintenance of the adult NSC pools. The reduced neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the dentate gyrus (DG) of GD3S-conditional-knockout mice led to impaired olfactory and memory functions. Thus, our results provide convincing evidence that postnatal GD3 maintains the quiescent state of radial glia-like NSCs in the adult NSC niche.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=100 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/532547v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15a6451org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1702776org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2edbb1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@59822f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Main PointsO_LIRadial glia-like neural stem cells (RGLs) lacking GD3 promote activation of quiescent RGLs.\nC_LIO_LIPostnatal depletion of GD3 results in reduced neural stem cell pools and impaired adult neurogenesis.\nC_LIO_LIPostnatal GD3 deletion in RGLs leads to impairment of olfactory and memory functions.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Shared input to a population of neurons induces noise correlations, which decreases the information carried by a population activity. Inhibitory feedback in recurrent neural networks can reduce the noise correlations and thus increase the information carried by the averaged population activity. However, the activity of inhibitory neurons is costly. This inhibitory feedback decreases the gain of the population. Thus, depolarization of its neurons requires stronger excitatory synaptic input, which is associated with higher ATP consumption. Given that the goal of neural populations is to transmit as much information as possible at minimal metabolic costs, it is unclear whether the increased information transmission reliability provided by inhibitory feedback compensates for the additional costs. We analyze this problem in a network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons receiving correlated input. By maximizing mutual information with metabolic cost constraints, we show that there is an optimal strength of recurrent connections in the network, which maximizes the value of mutual information-per-cost. For higher values of input correlation, the mutual information-per-cost is higher for recurrent networks with inhibitory feedback compared to feedforward networks without any inhibitory neurons. Our results, therefore, show that the optimal synaptic strength of a recurrent network can be inferred from metabolically efficient coding arguments and that decorrelation of the input by inhibitory feedback compensates for the associated increased metabolic costs.",

    "abstract": "Bipedal locomotion requires body adaptation to maintain stability after encountering a transition to inclined walking. A major adaptation is the change in walking speed to maintain optimal energy consumption. When transitioning to uphill walking, people exert more energy to counteract gravitational forces pulling them backward, while when transitioning to downhill walking people break to avoid uncontrolled acceleration. This behavior is controlled by three main senses: proprioception and vestibular (aka body-based cues), and visual cues. In this study, we aimed to measure the influence of the visual cues on these modulations in healthy older adults and compare it to healthy young adults. To that end, we used a fully immersive virtual-reality system embedded with a self-paced treadmill and projected visual scene that allowed us to manipulate the inclinations of the treadmill and the visual scene in an independent manner. In addition, we measured the visual field dependency of each participant using the rod and frame test. The group of older adults presented the braking (decelerating), and exertion (accelerating) effects, in response to downhill and uphill visual illusions, respectively, in a similar manner as the young group. Furthermore, we found a significant correlation between the intensity of the speed modulation and the visual field dependency for each group separately, however the visual field dependency was significantly higher in the elderly adults. These results suggest that with aging individuals maintain their reliance on the visual system to modulate their gait in accordance with surface inclination in the same manner as young adults.",

    "abstract": "A key role of sensory processing is integrating information across space. Neuronal responses in the visual system are influenced by both local features in the receptive field center and contextual information from the surround. While center-surround interactions have been extensively studied using simple stimuli like gratings, investigating these interactions with more complex, ecologically-relevant stimuli is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the stimulus space. We used large-scale neuronal recordings in mouse primary visual cortex to train convolutional neural network (CNN) models that accurately predicted center-surround interactions for natural stimuli. These models enabled us to synthesize surround stimuli that strongly suppressed or enhanced neuronal responses to the optimal center stimulus, as confirmed by in vivo experiments. In contrast to the common notion that congruent center and surround stimuli are suppressive, we found that excitatory surrounds appeared to complete spatial patterns in the center, while inhibitory surrounds disrupted them. We quantified this effect by demonstrating that CNN-optimized excitatory surround images have strong similarity in neuronal response space with surround images generated by extrapolating the statistical properties of the center, and with patches of natural scenes, which are known to exhibit high spatial correlations. Our findings cannot be explained by theories like redundancy reduction or predictive coding previously linked to contextual modulation in visual cortex. Instead, we demonstrated that a hierarchical probabilistic model incorporating Bayesian inference, and modulating neuronal responses based on prior knowledge of natural scene statistics, can explain our empirical results. We replicated these center-surround effects in the multi-area functional connectomics MICrONS dataset using natural movies as visual stimuli, which opens the way towards understanding circuit level mechanism, such as the contributions of lateral and feedback recurrent connections. Our data-driven modeling approach provides a new understanding of the role of contextual interactions in sensory processing and can be adapted across brain areas, sensory modalities, and species.",

    "abstract": "In the mammalian nose, two chemosensory systems, the trigeminal and the olfactory mediate the detection of volatile chemicals. Most odorants in fact are able to activate the trigeminal system, and vice versa, most trigeminal agonists activate the olfactory system as well. Although these two systems constitute two separate sensory modalities, trigeminal activation modulates the neural representation of an odor. The mechanisms behind the modulation of olfactory response by trigeminal activation are still poorly understood. In this study, we addressed this question by looking at the olfactory epithelium, where olfactory sensory neurons and trigeminal sensory fibers co-localize and where the olfactory signal is generated. We characterize the trigeminal activation in response to five different odorants by measuring intracellular Ca2+ changes from primary cultures of trigeminal neurons (TGNs). We also measured responses from mice lacking TRPA1 and TRPV1 channels known to mediate some trigeminal responses. Next, we tested how trigeminal activation affects the olfactory response in the olfactory epithelium using electro-olfactogram (EOG) recordings from WT and TRPA1/V1-KO mice. The trigeminal modulation of the olfactory response was determined by measuring responses to the odorant, 2-phenylethanol (PEA), an odorant with little trigeminal potency after stimulation with a trigeminal agonist. Trigeminal agonists induced a decrease in the EOG response to PEA, which depended on the level of TRPA1 and TRPV1 activation induced by the trigeminal agonist. This suggests that trigeminal activation can alter odorant responses even at the earliest stage of the olfactory sensory transduction.\n\nSignificance StatementMost odorants reaching the olfactory epithelium can simultaneously activate olfactory and trigeminal systems. Although these two systems constitute two separate sensory modalities, trigeminal activation can alter odor perception. Here, we analyzed the trigeminal activity induced by different odorants proposing an objective quantification of their trigeminal potency independent from human perception. We show that trigeminal activation by odorants reduces the olfactory response in the olfactory epithelium and that such modulation correlates with the trigeminal potency of the trigeminal agonist. These results show that the trigeminal system impacts the olfactory response from its earliest stage.",

    "abstract": "Several sensorimotor control studies have provided evidence supporting that the central nervous system optimizes gravitys effects to minimize muscle effort. Recently, this hypothesis has been supported by the consistent observation of direction-specific negative epochs in the phasic electromyographic signal of antigravity muscles during vertical arm movements. This suggests that gravity torque is harvested to produce some of the arms motion. However, further investigation is needed to more finely understand how the CNS integrates gravity effects into muscle commands. Here, we aimed to analyze the phasic muscular activity across varying movement speeds during horizontal and vertical arm movements. We quantified the amount of negativity during acceleration and deceleration phases for all movement directions during fast, natural, and slow movements. We found that the negativity was more important during the acceleration phase of downward movements and during the deceleration phase of upward movements, resulting in diminished phasic activity compared to horizontal movements. Concomitantly, we found direction-specific effects of movement speed on phasic EMG activity of gravity muscles. This resulted in altered EMG to kinematics relationships in vertical movements compared to horizontal ones. These results support the Effort-minimization hypothesis and confirm that the negativity of phasic EMG is an important aspect of the motor command. Furthermore, the present results reveal that the CNS finely tunes this feature across a range of movement speeds and directions.",

    "abstract": "It has been well established that attention can be sharpened through the process of statistical learning - whereby visual search is optimally adapted to the spatial probabilities of a target in visual fields. Specifically, attentional processing becomes more efficient when targets appear at high relatively to low probability locations. Statistically learned attentional enhancement has been shown to differ behaviorally from the more well studied top-down and bottom-up forms of attention; and while the electrophysiological characteristics of top-down and bottom-up attention have been well explored, relatively little work has been done to characterize the electrophysiological correlates of statistically learned attentional enhancement. In the current study, EEG data was collected while participants performed the additional singleton task with an unbalanced target distribution. Encephalographic data was then analyzed for two well-known correlates of attentional processing - alpha lateralization and the N2pc component. Our results showed that statistically learned attentional enhancement is not characterized by alpha lateralization, thereby differentiating it from top-down enhancement. Yet targets at high probability locations did reliably produce larger N2pc amplitudes, a known marker of increased bottom-up capture due to higher target-distractor contrasts. These results support an interpretation of the probability cuing effects where the improved processing of targets at expected locations is mediated by a saliency-based mechanism - boosting the salience of targets appearing at high-probability locations relative to those at low-probability locations.\n\nSignificance statementThings are easier to find when you have a good idea of where they should be - e.g. shoes on the floor and birds in the sky. Expectations of where things are likely to be found can be implicitly learned without much, if any, awareness. Until now, little was known about how these implicit spatial biases change the representation of items in the brain. In the current work, we present EEG recordings which suggest that the brain may represent items in common locations as more salient than in other locations in space. These findings inform how the brain represents implicit search expectations; supporting a model where items in expected areas in space capture attention more frequently because they are represented by the brain as more salient.",

    "abstract": "The complexity of natural scenes makes it challenging to experimentally study the mechanisms behind human gaze behavior when viewing dynamic environments. Historically, eye movements were believed to be driven primarily by space-based attention towards locations with salient features. Increasing evidence suggests, however, that visual attention does not select locations with high saliency but operates on attentional units given by the objects in the scene. We present a new computational framework to investigate the importance of objects for attentional guidance. This framework is designed to simulate realistic scanpaths for dynamic real-world scenes, including saccade timing and smooth pursuit behavior. Individual model components are based on psychophysically uncovered mechanisms of visual attention and saccadic decision-making. All mechanisms are implemented in a modular fashion with a small number of well-interpretable parameters. To systematically analyze the importance of objects in guiding gaze behavior, we implemented five different models within this framework: two purely spatial models, where one is based on low-level saliency and one on high-level saliency, two object-based models, with one incorporating low-level saliency for each object and the other one not using any saliency information, and a mixed model with object-based attention and selection but space-based inhibition of return. We optimized each models parameters to reproduce the saccade amplitude and fixation duration distributions of human scanpaths using evolutionary algorithms. We compared model performance with respect to spatial and temporal fixation behavior, including the proportion of fixations exploring the background, as well as detecting, inspecting, and returning to objects. A model with object-based attention and inhibition, which uses saliency information to prioritize between objects for saccadic selection, leads to scanpath statistics with the highest similarity to the human data. This demonstrates that scanpath models benefit from object-based attention and selection, suggesting that object-level attentional units play an important role in guiding attentional processing.\n\nAuthor summaryThere has long been an interest in understanding how we decide when and where to move our eyes, and psychophysical experiments have uncovered many underlying mechanisms. Under controlled laboratory conditions, objects in the scene play an important role in guiding our attention. Due to the visual complexity of the world around us, however, it is hard to assess experimentally how objects influence eye movements when observing dynamic real-world scenes. Computational models have proved to be a powerful tool for investigating visual attention, but existing models are either only applicable to images or restricted to predicting where humans look on average. Here, we present a computational framework for simulating where and when humans decide to move their eyes when observing dynamic real-world scenes. Using our framework, we can assess the influence of objects on the model predictions. We find that including object-based attention in the modeling increases the resemblance of simulated eye movements to human gaze behavior, showing that objects play indeed an important role in guiding our gaze when exploring the world around us. We hope that the availability of this framework encourages more research on attention in dynamic real-world scenes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, are complex and challenging to study, partly due to the lack of suitable animal models. However, the absence of the Slc10a4 gene, which codes for a monoaminergic and cholinergic associated vesicular transporter protein, in knockout mice (Slc10a4 -/-), leads to the accumulation of extracellular dopamine. This makes them a potential animal model for schizophrenia, a disorder known to be associated with altered dopamine signaling in the brain.\n\nMethodsThe locomotion, auditory sensory filtering and prepulse inhibition (PPI) of Slc10a4 -/- mice were quantified and compared to wildtype (WT) littermates. Intrahippocampal electrodes were used to record auditory event-related potentials (aERPs) for quantifying sensory filtering in response to paired-clicks. The channel above aERPs phase reversal was chosen for reliably comparing results between animals, and aERPs amplitude and latency of click responses were quantified. WT and Slc10a4 -/- mice were also administered subanesthetic doses of ketamine to provoke psychomimetic behavior.\n\nResultsBaseline locomotion during auditory stimulation was similar between Slc10a4 -/- mice and WT littermates. In WT animals, normal auditory gating was observed after i.p saline injections, and it was maintained under the influence of 5 mg/kg ketamine, but disrupted by 20 mg/kg ketamine. On the other hand, Slc10a4 -/- mice did not show significant differences between N40 S1 and S2 amplitude responses in saline or low dose ketamine treatment. Auditory gating was considered preserved since the second N40 peak was consistently suppressed, but with increased latency. The P80 component showed higher amplitude, with shorter S2 latency under saline and 5 mg/kg ketamine treatment in Slc10a4 -/- mice, which was not observed in WT littermates. Prepulse inhibition was also decreased in Slc10a4 -/- mice when the longer interstimulus interval of 100 ms was applied, compared to WT littermates.\n\nConclusionThe Slc10a4 -/- mice responses indicate that cholinergic and monoaminergic systems participate in the PPI magnitude, in the temporal coding (response latency) of the auditory sensory gating component N40, and in the amplitude of aERPs P80 component. These results suggest that Slc10a4 -/- mice can be considered as potential models for neuropsychiatric conditions.",

    "abstract": "Neural dynamics can reflect intrinsic dynamics or dynamic inputs, such as sensory inputs or inputs from other regions. To avoid misinterpreting temporally-structured inputs as intrinsic dynamics, dynamical models of neural activity should account for measured inputs. However, incorporating measured inputs remains elusive in joint dynamical modeling of neural-behavioral data, which is important for studying neural computations of a specific behavior. We first show how training dynamical models of neural activity while considering behavior but not input, or input but not behavior may lead to misinterpretations. We then develop a novel analytical learning method that simultaneously accounts for neural activity, behavior, and measured inputs. The method provides the new capability to prioritize the learning of intrinsic behaviorally relevant neural dynamics and dissociate them from both other intrinsic dynamics and measured input dynamics. In data from a simulated brain with fixed intrinsic dynamics that performs different tasks, the method correctly finds the same intrinsic dynamics regardless of task while other methods can be influenced by the change in task. In neural datasets from three subjects performing two different motor tasks with task instruction sensory inputs, the method reveals low-dimensional intrinsic neural dynamics that are missed by other methods and are more predictive of behavior and/or neural activity. The method also uniquely finds that the intrinsic behaviorally relevant neural dynamics are largely similar across the three subjects and two tasks whereas the overall neural dynamics are not. These input-driven dynamical models of neural-behavioral data can uncover intrinsic dynamics that may otherwise be missed.",

    "abstract": "Local cortical circuit function is regulated by diverse populations of GABAergic interneurons with distinct properties and extensive interconnectivity. Inhibitory-to-inhibitory interactions between interneuron populations may play key roles in shaping circuit operation according to behavioral context. A specialized population of GABAergic interneurons that co-express vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP-INs) are activated during arousal and locomotion and innervate other local interneurons and pyramidal neurons. Although modulation of VIP-IN activity by behavioral state has been extensively studied, their role in regulating information processing and selectivity is less well understood. Using a combination of cellular imaging, short and long-term manipulation, and perceptual behavior, we examined the impact of VIP-INs on their synaptic target populations in the primary visual cortex of awake behaving mice. We find that loss of VIP-IN activity alters the behavioral state-dependent modulation of somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SST-INs) but not pyramidal neurons (PNs). In contrast, reduced VIP-IN activity disrupts visual feature selectivity for stimulus size in both populations. Inhibitory-to inhibitory interactions thus directly shape the selectivity of GABAergic interneurons for sensory stimuli. Moreover, the impact of VIP-IN activity on perceptual behavior varies with visual context and is more acute for small than large visual cues. VIP-INs thus contribute to both state-dependent modulation of cortical circuit activity and sensory context-dependent perceptual performance.",

    "abstract": "Photometry approaches detect sensor-mediated changes in fluorescence as a proxy for rapid molecular changes within the brain. As a flexible technique with a relatively low cost to implement, photometry is rapidly being incorporated into neuroscience laboratories. While multiple data acquisition systems for photometry now exist, robust analytical pipelines for the resulting data remain limited. Here we present the Photometry Analysis Toolkit (PhAT) - a free open source analysis pipeline that provides options for signal normalization, incorporation of multiple data streams to align photometry data with behavior and other events, calculation of event-related changes in fluorescence, and comparison of similarity across fluorescent traces. A graphical user interface (GUI) enables use of this software without prior coding knowledge. In addition to providing foundational analytical tools, PhAT is designed to readily incorporate community-driven development of new modules for more bespoke analyses, and data can be easily exported to enable subsequent statistical testing and/or code-based analyses. In addition, we provide recommendations regarding technical aspects of photometry experiments including sensor selection and validation, reference signal considerations, and best practices for experimental design and data collection. We hope that the distribution of this software and protocol will lower the barrier to entry for new photometry users and improve the quality of collected data, increasing transparency and reproducibility in photometry analyses.

    "abstract": "Synaptic transmission mediated by GABAA receptors (GABAARs) in adult, principal striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) can suppress ongoing spiking, but its effect on synaptic integration at sub-threshold membrane potentials is less well characterized, particularly those near the resting down-state. To fill this gap, a combination of molecular, optogenetic, optical and electrophysiological approaches were used to study SPNs in mouse ex vivo brain slices, and computational tools were used to model somatodendritic synaptic integration. Activation of GABAARs, either by uncaging of GABA or by optogenetic stimulation of GABAergic synapses, evoked currents with a reversal potential near -60 mV in perforated patch recordings from both juvenile and adult SPNs. Molecular profiling of SPNs suggested that this relatively positive reversal potential was not attributable to NKCC1 expression, but rather to a dynamic equilibrium between KCC2 and Cl-/HCO3-cotransporters. Regardless, from down-state potentials, optogenetic activation of dendritic GABAergic synapses depolarized SPNs. This GABAAR-mediated depolarization summed with trailing ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) stimulation, promoting dendritic spikes and increasing somatic depolarization. Simulations revealed that a diffuse dendritic GABAergic input to SPNs effectively enhanced the response to coincident glutamatergic input. Taken together, our results demonstrate that GABAARs can work in concert with iGluRs to excite adult SPNs when they are in the resting down-state, suggesting that their inhibitory role is limited to brief periods near spike threshold. This state-dependence calls for a reformulation of the role intrastriatal GABAergic circuits.",

    "abstract": "The Human Connectome Project Multimodal Parcellation (HCP_MMP1.0) provides a robust in vivo map of the cerebral cortex, which demonstrates variability in structure and function that cannot be captured through diffeomorphic image registration alone. The HCP successfully employed a fully-connected neural network architecture to capture this variation, however it is unclear whether this approach generalises to other datasets with less rich imaging protocols. In this paper we propose and validate a novel geometric deep learning framework for generating individualised HCP_MMP1.0 parcellations in UK Biobank (UKB), an extremely rich resource that has led to numerous breakthroughs in neuroscience. To address substantial differences in image acquisition (for example, 6 minutes of resting-state fMRI per subject for UKB vs. 60 minutes per subject for HCP), we introduce a multi-step learning procedure including pretraining with a convolutional autoencoder. Compared to a fully-connected baseline, our proposed framework improved average detection rate across all areas by 10.4% (99.1% vs 88.7%), and detection of the worst performing area by 51.0% (80.9% vs. 29.9%). Importantly, this was not a result of the framework predicting one consistent parcellation across subjects, as visual inspection indicated that our method was sensitive to atypical cortical topographies.

Most COVID-19 vaccines direct mammalian cells to express the Spike protein or deliver it directly via inoculation to engender a protective immune response.

In this study we inoculated mice intranasally, intravenously, and subcutaneously with fluorescently labeled recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Using flow cytometry and imaging techniques we analyzed its localization, immune cell tropism, and acute functional impact. Intranasal administration led to rapid lung alveolar macrophage uptake, pulmonary vascular leakage, and neutrophil recruitment and damage.

Wide-spread endothelial and liver Kupffer cell uptake followed intravenous administration. Human peripheral blood cells B cells, neutrophils, monocytes, and myeloid dendritic cells all efficiently bound Spike protein. Exposure to the Spike protein enhanced neutrophil NETosis and augmented human macrophage TNF- and IL-6 production.

While serological assays for the measurement of antibody levels and of neutralization potential against SARS-CoV-2 are available, these are not quantitative in the biochemical sense. Yet, understanding the biology of COVID-19 would need an unambiguous, complete, quantitative, comparable measurement of specific serum antibodies.\n\nHere we describe a fluorescent, dual-titration immunoassay, which provides the physico-chemical parameters that are both necessary and sufficient to quantitatively characterize the humoral immune response. We used recombinant Receptor Binding Domain of SARS-CoV-2 as antigen on microspot arrays and varied the concentration of both the antigen and serum antibodies from vaccinated persons to obtain a measurement matrix of binding data. Binding curves were fitted using a novel algorithm to obtain thermodynamic variables of binding. We defined the standard state for a system of serum antibodies and antigen and showed how a normalized generalized logistic function is related to thermodynamic activity, standard concentration and activity coefficient. The utility of the method is demonstrated by defining the composition of tested sera with respect to immunoglobulin classes, affinity, concentration, and thermodynamic activity.\n\nThe proposed fluorescent dual-titration microspot immunoassay can generate truly quantitative serological data that is suitable for immunological, medical and systems biological analysis.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has motivated research on the persistence of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in environmental reservoirs such as surfaces and water. Viral persistence data has been collected for SARS-CoV-2 and its surrogates, including bacteriophage Phi6. Despite its wide use, no side-by-side comparisons between Phi6 and SARS-CoV-2 exist. Here, we quantified the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 and Phi6 on surfaces (plastic and metal) and in water and evaluated the influence that the deposition solution has on viral persistence by using four commonly used deposition solutions: two culture media (DMEM and Tryptone Soya Broth (TSB)), Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS), and human saliva. Phi6 remained infectious in water significantly longer than SARS-CoV-2, having a half-life of 27 hours as compared with 15 hours for SARS-CoV-2. The persistence of viruses on surfaces was significantly influenced by the virus used and the deposition solution, but not by the surface material. Phi6 remained infectious significantly longer than SARS-CoV-2 when the inoculation solution was culture media (DMEM, TSB) and saliva. Using culture media and saliva led to half-lives between 9 hours and 2 weeks for Phi6, as compared to 0.5 to 2 hours for SARS-CoV-2. Using PBS as a deposition solution led to half-lives shorter than 4 hours for both viruses on all surfaces. Our results showed that, although it has been frequently used as a surrogate for coronaviruses, bacteriophage Phi6 is not an adequate surrogate for studies quantifying SARS-CoV-2 persistence, as it over-estimates infectiousness. Additionally, our findings reveal the need of using adequate deposition solutions when evaluating viral persistence on surfaces.",

Nanobodies were selected after the biopanning of two VHH-libraries, one of which was generated after the immunization of a llama (lama glama) with the bovine coronavirus (BCoV) Mebus, and another with the full-length pre-fused locked S protein (S-2P) and the RBD from the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain (WT). Most of the neutralizing Nbs selected with either RBD or S-2P from SARS-CoV-2 were directed to RBD and were able to block S- 2P/ACE2 interaction. Three Nbs recognized the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S-2P protein as measured by competition with biliverdin, while some non-neutralizing Nbs recognize epitopes in the S2 domain. One Nb from the BCoV immune library was directed to RBD but was non-neutralizing. Intranasal administration of Nbs induced protection ranging from 40% to 80% against COVID-19 death in k18-hACE2 mice challenged with the WT strain. Interestingly, protection was not only associated with a significant reduction of virus replication in nasal turbinates and lungs, but also with a reduction of virus load in the brain. Employing pseudovirus neutralization assays, we were able to identify Nbs with neutralizing capacity against the Alpha, Beta, Delta and Omicron variants. Furthermore, cocktails of different Nbs performed better than individual Nbs to neutralize two Omicron variants (B.1.529 and BA.2). Altogether, the data suggest these Nbs can potentially be used as a cocktail for intranasal treatment to prevent or treat COVID-19 encephalitis, or modified for prophylactic administration to fight this disease.",

    "abstract": "Abstract/Summary ParagraphThe gut microbiome plays major roles in modulating host physiology. One such function is colonization resistance, or the ability of the microbial collective to protect the host against enteric pathogens1-3, including enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) serotype O157:H7, an attaching and effacing (AE) food-borne pathogen that causes severe gastroenteritis, enterocolitis, bloody diarrhea, and acute renal failure (hemolytic uremic syndrome)4,5. Although gut microbes can provide colonization resistance by outcompeting some pathogens or modulating host defense provided by the gut barrier and intestinal immune cells, this phenomenon remains poorly understood. Emerging evidence suggests that small-molecule metabolites produced by the gut microbiota may mediate this process6. Here, we show that tryptophan (Trp)-derived metabolites produced by the gut bacteria protect the host against Citrobacter rodentium, a murine AE pathogen widely used as a model for EHEC infection7,8, by activation of the host neurotransmitter dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) within the intestinal epithelium. We further find that these Trp metabolites act through DRD2 to decrease expression of a host actin regulatory protein involved in C. rodentium and EHEC attachment to the gut epithelium via formation of actin pedestals. Previously identified mechanisms of colonization resistance either directly affect the pathogen by competitive exclusion or indirectly by modulation of host defense mechanisms9,10, so our results delineate a noncanonical colonization resistance pathway against AE pathogens featuring an unconventional role for DRD2 outside the nervous system in controlling actin cytoskeletal organization within the gut epithelium. Our findings may inspire prophylactic and therapeutic approaches for improving gut health and treating gastrointestinal infections, which afflict millions globally.",

    "abstract": "Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular bacterium that is responsible for the most prevalent bacterial sexually transmitted infections. Changes in DNA topology in this pathogen have been linked to its pathogenicity-associated developmental cycle. Here, evidence is provided that the balanced activity of DNA topoisomerases (Topos) contributes to Chlamydia developmental processes. Utilizing catalytically inactivated Cas12 (dCas12) based-clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference (CRISPRi) technology, we demonstrate targeted knockdown of chromosomal topA transcription in C. trachomatis without detected toxicity of dCas12. Repression of topA impaired the growth of C. trachomatis mostly through disruption of its differentiation from a replicative form to an infectious form. Consistent with this, expression of late developmental genes of C. trachomatis was downregulated while early genes maintained their expression. Importantly, the growth defect associated with topA knockdown was rescued by overexpressing topA at an appropriate degree and time, directly linking the growth patterns to the levels of topA expression. Interestingly, topA knockdown had pleiotropic effects on DNA gyrase expression, indicating a potential compensatory mechanism for survival to offset TopA deficiency. C. trachomatis with topA knocked down displayed hypersensitivity to moxifloxacin that targets DNA gyrase in comparison with the wild type. These data underscore the requirement of integrated topoisomerase actions to support the essential development and transcriptional processes of C. trachomatis.\n\nImportanceWe used genetic and chemical tools to demonstrate the relationship of topoisomerase activities and their obligatory role for the chlamydial developmental cycle. Successfully targeting the essential gene topA with a CRISPRi approach, using dCas12, in C. trachomatis indicates that this method will facilitate the characterization of the essential genome. These findings have an important impact on our understanding of the mechanism(s) by which well-balanced topoisomerase activities enable C. trachomatis to adapt to unfavorable growth conditions imposed by antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "N-terminal protein acetylation is a ubiquitous post-translational modification that broadly impacts diverse cellular processes in higher organisms. Bacterial proteins are also N-terminally acetylated, but the mechanisms and consequences of this modification in bacteria are poorly understood. We previously quantified widespread N-terminal protein acetylation in pathogenic mycobacteria (C. R. Thompson, M. M. Champion, and P.A. Champion, J Proteome Res 17(9): 3246-3258, 2018, https://doi:10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00373). The major virulence factor EsxA (ESAT-6, Early secreted antigen, 6kDa) was one of the first N-terminally acetylated proteins identified in bacteria. EsxA is conserved in mycobacterial pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium marinum, a non-tubercular mycobacterial species that causes tuberculosis-like disease in ectotherms. However, enzyme responsible for EsxA N-terminal acetylation has been elusive. Here, we used genetics, molecular biology, and mass-spectroscopy based proteomics to demonstrate that MMAR_1839 (renamed Emp1, ESX-1 modifying protein, 1) is the putative N-acetyl transferase (NAT) solely responsible for EsxA acetylation in Mycobacterium marinum. We demonstrated that ERD_3144, the orthologous gene in M. tuberculosis Erdman, is functionally equivalent to Emp1. We identified at least 22 additional proteins that require Emp1 for acetylation, demonstrating that this putative NAT is not dedicated to EsxA. Finally, we showed that loss of emp1 resulted in a significant reduction in the ability of M. marinum to cause macrophage cytolysis. Collectively, this study identified a NAT required for N-terminal acetylation in Mycobacterium and provided insight into the requirement of N-terminal acetylation of EsxA and other proteins in mycobacterial virulence in the macrophage.\n\nSignificance StatementN-terminal acetylation is a protein modification that broadly impacts basic cellular function, protein turnover and disease in higher organisms. In bacteria, very little is understood how N-terminal acetylation impacts bacterial physiology and pathogenesis. Mycobacterial pathogens cause acute and chronic diseases in humans and in animals. [~]15% of mycobacterial proteins are N-terminally acetylated, but the enzymes responsible for this protein modification are largely unknown. We identified a conserved mycobacterial protein, MMAR_1839, that is required for the N-terminal acetylation of 23 mycobacterial proteins including EsxA, a protein essential for mycobacteria to cause disease. Loss of this enzyme from Mycobacterium marinum reduced macrophage killing, which is required for bacterial spread in the host. Defining the acetyltransferases responsible for the N-terminal protein acetylation of essential virulence factors could lead to new targets for therapeutics against mycobacterial pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular electron transfer (EET) is a metabolic process that frequently uses quinones to couple intracellular redox reactions with extracellular electron acceptors. The physiological relevance of this metabolism for microorganisms that are capable of EET, but unable to synthesize their own quinones, remains to be determined. To address this question, we investigated quinone utilization by Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, a microorganism required for food fermentations, performs EET, and is also a quinone auxotroph. L. plantarum selectively used 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (DHNA), 2-amino-3-carboxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (ACNQ), 1,4-naphthoquinone, and menadione for EET reduction of insoluble iron (ferrihydrite). However, those quinones used for EET also inhibited L. plantarum growth in non-aerated conditions. Transcriptomic analysis showed that DHNA induced oxidative stress in L. plantarum and this was alleviated by the inclusion of an electron acceptor, soluble ferric ammonium citrate (FeAC), in the laboratory culture medium. The presence of DHNA and FeAC during growth also induced L. plantarum EET metabolism, although activity was still dependent on the presence of exogenous electron shuttles. To determine whether quinone-producing bacteria frequently found together with L. plantarum in food fermentations could be a source of those electron shuttles, L. plantarum EET was measured after incubation with Lactococcus lactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides. Quinone-producing L. lactis, but not a quinone-deficient L. lactis {Delta}menC mutant, increased L. plantarum ferrihydrite reduction and medium acidification through an EET-dependent mechanism. L. plantarum EET was also stimulated by L. mesenteroides, and this resulted in greater environmental acidification and transient increases in L. plantarum growth. Overall, our findings revealed that L. plantarum overcomes the toxic effects of exogenous quinones to use those compounds, including those made by related bacteria, for EET-conferred, ecological advantages during the early stages of food fermentations.",

The results confirmed previous findings, validating our approach for scaling up, and identified new genes required for ookinete motility and mosquito midgut infection and for sporozoite development and oocyst egress and salivary gland infection.

A recent study suggested that RSV infection causes cell expansion, resulting in bronchial wall thickening in vitro. Whether the virus-induced changes in the lung airway resemble epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is still unknown. Here, we report that RSV does not induce EMT in three different in vitro lung models: the epithelial A549 cell line, primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells, and pseudostratified airway epithelium. We found that RSV increases the cell surface area and perimeter in the infected airway epithelium, which is distinct from the effects of a potent EMT inducer, TGF-{beta}1-driven cell elongation--indicative of cell motility. A genome-wide transcriptome analysis revealed that both RSV and TGF-{beta}1 have distinct modulation patterns of the transcriptome, which suggests that RSV-induced changes are distinct from EMT.",

    "abstract": "Root-associated microbiota can protect plants against severe disease outbreaks. In the model-plant Arabidopsis thaliana, leaf infection with the obligate downy mildew pathogen Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Hpa) results in a shift in the root exudation profile, therewith promoting the growth of a selective root microbiome that induces a systemic resistance against Hpa in the above-ground plant parts. Here we show that, additionally, a conserved subcommunity of the recruited soil microbiota becomes part of a pathogen-associated microbiome in the phyllosphere that is vertically transmitted with the spores of the pathogen to consecutively infected host plants. This subcommunity of Hpa-associated microbiota (HAM) limits pathogen infection and is therefore coined a \"resistobiome\". The HAM resistobiome consists of a small number of bacterial species and was first found in our routinely maintained laboratory cultures of independent Hpa strains. When co-inoculated with Hpa spores, the HAM rapidly dominates the phyllosphere of infected plants, negatively impacting Hpa spore formation. Remarkably, isogenic bacterial isolates of the abundantly-present HAM species were also found in strictly separated Hpa cultures across Europe, and even in early published genomes of this obligate biotroph. Our results highlight that pathogen-infected plants can recruit protective microbiota via their roots to the shoots where they become part of a pathogen-associated resistobiome that helps the plant to fight pathogen infection. Understanding the mechanisms by which pathogen-associated resistobiomes are formed will enable the development of microbiome-assisted crop varieties that rely less on chemical crop protection.",

However, only a small fraction of these isolates has been completely sequenced, limiting our understanding of the genomic diversity of giant viruses. MinION is a portable and low-cost long-read sequencer that can be readily used in a laboratory. Although MinION provides highly error-prone reads that require correction through additional short-read sequencing, recent studies assembled high-quality microbial genomes only using MinION sequencing. Here, we evaluated the accuracy of MinION-only genome assemblies for giant viruses by re-sequencing a prototype marseillevirus. Assembled genomes presented over 99.98% identity to the reference genome with a few gaps, demonstrating a high accuracy of the MinION-only assembly. As a proof of concept, we de novo assembled five newly isolated viruses. Average nucleotide identities to their closest known relatives suggest that the isolates represent new species of marseillevirus, pithovirus, and mimivirus. Assembly of subsampled reads demonstrated that their taxonomy and genomic composition could be analyzed at the 50x sequencing coverage. We also identified a pithovirus gene whose homologues were detected only in metagenome-derived relatives. Collectively, we propose that MinION-only assembly is an effective approach to rapidly perform a genome-wide analysis of isolated giant viruses.",

Our study sought to establish the first baseline data on the gut microbiota of free-ranging foregut-fermenting proboscis monkeys and to determine how their microbiota are affected locally by environmental (e.g., geographical distance) and social (e.g., group size) factors in proboscis monkeys living in a riparian forest in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing of feces collected from more than 300 free-ranging proboscis monkeys, we demonstrated that they were dominated by Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes at the phylum level, with Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae being the most abundant families and Oscillospira and Ruminococcus being the dominant genera; this trend suggests that the microbial community composition of proboscis monkeys is not particularly distinctive compared to other foregut and hindgut fermenting primates. The microbial alpha diversity was higher in larger groups and individuals inhabiting diverse vegetation (i.e., presumed to have a diverse diet). For microbial beta diversity, some measures were significant, showing higher values with larger geographical distances between samples. These results suggest that social factors such as increased interindividual interactions, which can occur with larger groups, as well as physical distances between individuals or differences in dietary patterns, may affect the gut microbial communities of proboscis monkeys.",

    "abstract": "Enzymes catalyze the chemical reactions of life. For nearly half of known enzymes, catalysis requires the binding of small molecules known as cofactors. Polypeptide-cofactor complexes likely formed at a primordial stage and became starting points for the evolution of many efficient enzymes. Yet, evolution has no foresight so the driver for the primordial complex formation is unknown. Here, we use a resurrected ancestral TIM-barrel protein to identify one potential driver. Heme binding at a flexible region of the ancestral structure yields a peroxidation catalyst with enhanced efficiency when compared to free heme. This enhancement, however, does not arise from protein-mediated promotion of catalysis. Rather, it reflects protection of bound heme from common degradation processes and a resulting longer life time and higher effective concentration for the catalyst. Protection of catalytic cofactors by polypeptides emerges as a general mechanism to enhance catalysis and may have plausibly benefited primordial polypeptide-cofactor associations.",

    "abstract": "Single-site synonymous mutations typically have only minor or no effects on gene function. Here, we estimate the effects on cell growth of ~200 single-site synonymous mutations in an operonic context by mutating each position of ccdB, the 101-residue long cytotoxin of the ccdAB Toxin-Antitoxin (TA) operon to all possible degenerate codons. Phenotypes were assayed by transforming the mutant library into CcdB sensitive and resistant E. coli strains, isolating plasmid pools, and subjecting them to deep sequencing. Since autoregulation is a hallmark of TA operons, phenotypes obtained for ccdB synonymous mutants after transformation in a RelE toxin reporter strain followed by deep sequencing provided information on the amount of CcdAB complex formed. Synonymous mutations in the N-terminal region involved in translation initiation showed the strongest non-neutral phenotypic effects. We observe an interplay of numerous factors, namely, location of the codon, codon usage, t-RNA abundance, formation of anti-Shine Dalgarno sequences, transcript secondary structure, and evolutionary conservation in determining phenotypic effects of ccdB synonymous mutations. Incorporation of an N-terminal, hyperactive synonymous mutation, in the background of the single-site synonymous mutant library sufficiently increased translation initiation, such that mutational effects on either folding or termination of translation became more apparent. Introduction of putative pause sites not only affects the translational rate but might also alter the folding kinetics of the protein in vivo. This information is useful in optimizing heterologous gene expression in E. coli and understanding the molecular bases for alteration in gene expression that arise due to synonymous mutations.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSynonymous mutations which do not change amino-acid identity, typically have only minor or no effects on gene function. Using sensitive genetic screens in the context of the ccdAB bacterial toxin-antitoxin operon, we demonstrate that many single-site synonymous mutations of the ccdB toxin gene display significant phenotypic effects in an operonic context. The largest effects were seen for synonymous mutations in the N-terminal region involved in translation initiation. Synonymous mutations that affected either folding or translation termination were also identified. Lack of translational pausing due to synonymous mutations in hydrophobic residue stretches, was found to decrease the amount of properly folded CcdB protein. In summary the study provides novel insights into diverse mechanisms by which synonymous mutations modulate gene function.",

These waves were particularly dramatic in the metropolitan cities due to high population density. We evaluated the prevalence, and mutational spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 variants/lineages in one such megapolis, Bengaluru city, across these three waves between October 2020 and June 2022. 15,134 SARS-CoV-2 samples were subjected to whole genome sequencing (WGS). Phylogenetic analysis revealed, SARS-CoV-2 variants in Bengaluru city belonged to 18 clades and 196 distinct lineages. As expected, the Delta lineages were the most dominant lineages during the second wave of COVID-19. The Omicron lineage BA.2 and its sublineages accounted for most of the COVID-19 cases in the third wave. Most number of amino acid changes were observed in spike protein.

Mitochondria lacking Hem25p fail to efficiently incorporate IPP into early CoQ precursors, leading to loss of CoQ and turnover of CoQ biosynthetic proteins.

In order to extend the range of in-yeast cloning strategies, a new approach combining two already described methods, the Fusion cloning and the CReasPy-Cloning, was developed. The CReasPy-Fusion method allows the simultaneous cloning and engineering of megabase-sized genomes in yeast by fusion of bacterial cells with yeast spheroplasts carrying the CRISPR-Cas9 system. With this new approach, we demonstrate the feasibility of cloning and editing whole genomes from several Mycoplasma species belonging to different phylogenetic groups. We also show that CReasPy-Fusion allows the capture of large genome fragments with high efficacy, resulting in the successful cloning of selected loci in yeast. We finally identify bacterial nuclease encoding genes as barriers for CReasPy-Fusion by showing that their removal from the donor genome improves cloning efficacy.",

In the 12 yrs following the jump, both active and inactive forms of MgCas9 were found in circulation, after which all isolates displayed inactive forms only. Isolates with active CRISPR-Cas harboured new sets of spacers, and a MgCas9 PI domain targeting a new protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), consistent with a change in the community of phages and mobile elements encountered within the novel host. The striking concordance in time between the rise of inactivated forms of CRISPR-Cas and the evolution of widespread host resistance, suggests that inactivation was subsequently necessary for adaptive bacterial responses.

We show here that surface-exposed trehalose polyphleates (TPPs) are required for infection of Mycobacterium abscessus and Mycobacterium smegmatis by clinically useful phages BPs and Muddy, and that TPP loss leads to defects in adsorption, infection, and confers resistance. Transposon mutagenesis indicates that TPP loss is the primary mechanism for phage resistance. Spontaneous phage resistance occurs through TPP loss, and some M. abscessus clinical isolates are phage-insensitive due to TPP absence. Both BPs and Muddy become TPP-independent through single amino acid substitutions in their tail spike proteins, and M. abscessus mutants resistant to TPP-independent phages reveal additional resistance mechanisms. Clinical use of BPs and Muddy TPP-independent mutants should preempt phage resistance caused by TPP loss.",

Gut microbiota plays important roles in the metabolism and immunity of fish, and has the potential to give rise to novel green inputs for fish culture. However, our understanding of fish gut microbiome is still lacking.\n\nResultsWe identified 575,856 non-redundant genes by metagenomic sequencing of the intestinal content samples of grass carp. Taxonomic and functional annotation of the gene catalogue revealed specificity of the gut microbiome of grass carp compared with mammals. Co-occurrence analysis indicated exclusive relations between the genera belonging to Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria/Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes, suggesting two independent ecological groups of the microbiota. The association pattern of Proteobacteria with the gene expression modules of fish gut and liver was consistently opposite to that of Fusobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, implying differential functionality of Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria/Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes. Therefore, the two ecological groups were divided into two functional groups, i.e., Functional Group 1: Proteobacteria; Functional Group 2: Fusobacteria/Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes. Further analysis revealed that the two functional groups differ in genetic capacity for carbohydrate utilization, virulence factors and antibiotic resistance. Finally, we proposed that the ratio of \"Functional Group 2/Functional Group 1\" can be used as a biomarker that efficiently reflects the structural and functional characteristics of the microbiota of grass carp.\n\nConclusionsThe gene catalogue is an important resource for investigating the gut microbiome of grass carp. Multi-omics analysis provides insights into functional implications of the main phyla that comprise the fish microbiota, and shed lights on targets for microbiota regulation.",

While QS has been proposed as a potential intervention against pathogen infection, QS-mediated communication within the mammalian digestive tract remains understudied.

We then profiled their accumulation both in vitro and across different gastrointestinal sites over the course of infection. Importantly, we found that in the absence of QS capabilities the virulence of C. rodentium is enhanced. This highlights the role of QS as an effective mechanism to regulate virulence according to the pathogens spatio-temporal context to optimize colonization and transmission success.

    "abstract": "The mechanisms and regulation of RNA degradation in mycobacteria have been subject to increased interest following the identification of interplay between RNA metabolism and drug resistance. Mycobacteria encode multiple ribonucleases that are predicted to participate in mRNA degradation and/or processing of stable RNAs. RNase E is an endoribonuclease hypothesized to play a major role in mRNA degradation due to its essentiality in mycobacteria and its role in mRNA degradation in gram- negative bacteria. Here, we defined the impact of RNase E on mRNA degradation rates transcriptome- wide in the non-pathogenic model Mycolicibacterium smegmatis. RNase E played a rate-limiting role in the degradation of at least 89% of protein-coding genes, with leadered transcripts generally being more affected by RNase E repression than leaderless transcripts. There was an apparent global slowing of transcription in response to knockdown of RNase E, suggesting that M. smegmatis regulates transcription in responses to changes in mRNA degradation. This compensation was incomplete, as the abundance of most transcripts increased upon RNase E knockdown. We assessed the sequence preferences for cleavage by RNase E transcriptome-wide in both M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis, and found a consistent bias for cleavage in C-rich regions. Purified RNase E had a clear preference for cleavage immediately upstream of cytidines, distinct from the sequence preferences of RNase E in gram-negatives. We furthermore report a high-resolution map of mRNA cleavage sites in M. tuberculosis, which occur primarily within the RNase E-preferred sequence context, confirming RNase E as a broad contributor to M. tuberculosis transcriptome structure.",

    "abstract": "Invasive fungal diseases are a major threat to human health, resulting in more than 1.5 million deaths worldwide each year. Yet the arsenal of antifungal therapeutics remains limited and is in dire need of novel drugs that target additional fungal-specific biosynthetic pathways. One such pathway involves the biosynthesis of trehalose. Trehalose is a non-reducing disaccharide composed of two molecules of glucose that is required for pathogenic fungi, including Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans, to survive in their human hosts. Trehalose biosynthesis is a two-step process in fungal pathogens. Trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (Tps1) converts UDP-glucose and glucose-6-phosphate to trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P). Subsequently, trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (Tps2) converts T6P to trehalose. The trehalose biosynthesis pathway has been identified as a top candidate for novel antifungal development based on quality, occurrence, specificity, and assay development. However, there are currently no known antifungal agents that target this pathway. As initial steps to develop Tps1 from Cryptococcus neoformans (CnTps1) as a drug target, we report the structures of full-length apo CnTps1 and CnTps1 in complex with uridine diphosphate (UDP) and glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). Both CnTps1 structures are tetramers and display D2 (222) molecular symmetry. Comparison of these two structures reveals significant movement towards the catalytic pocket by the N-terminus upon ligand binding and identifies key residues required for substrate-binding, which are conserved amongst other Tps1 enzymes, as well as residues that stabilize the tetramer. Intriguingly, an intrinsically disordered domain (IDD), encompassing residues M209 to I300, which is conserved amongst Cryptococcal species and closely related Basidiomycetes, extends from each subunit of the tetramer into the \"solvent\"but is not visible in the density maps. Although, activity assays revealed that the highly conserved IDD is not required for catalysis in vitro, we hypothesize that the IDD is required for C. neoformans Tps1-dependent thermotolerance and osmotic stress survival. Characterization of the substrate specificity of CnTps1 revealed that UDP-galactose, an epimer of UDP-glucose, is a very poor substrate and inhibitor of the enzyme and highlights the exquisite substrate specificity of Tps1. In toto, these studies expand our knowledge of trehalose biosynthesis in Cryptococcus and highlight the potential of developing antifungal therapeutics that disrupt the synthesis of this disaccharide or the formation of a functional tetramer and the use of cryo-EM in the structural characterization of CnTps1-ligand/drug complexes.",

    "abstract": "LC3b (Map1lc3b) plays an essential role in canonical autophagy and is one of several components of the autophagy machinery that mediates non-canonical autophagic functions. Phagosomes are often associated with lipidated LC3b, to pro-mote phagosome maturation in a process called LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP). Specialized phagocytes such as mammary epithelial cells, retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, and sertoli cells utilize LAP for optimal degradation of phagocytosed material, including debris. In the visual system, LAP is critical to maintain retinal function, lipid homeostasis and neuroprotection. In a mouse model of retinal lipid steatosis - mice lacking LC3b (LC3b-/-), we observed increased lipid deposition, metabolic dysregulation and enhanced inflammation. Herein we present a non-biased approach to determine if loss of LAP mediated processes modulate the expression of various genes related to metabolic homeostasis, lipid handling, and inflammation. A comparison of the RPE transcriptome of WT and LC3b-/- mice revealed 1533 DEGs, with ~73% upregulated and 27% down-regulated. Enriched gene ontology (GO) terms included inflammatory response (upregulated DEGs), fatty acid metabolism and vascular transport (downregulated DEGs). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) identified 34 pathways; 28 were upregulated (dominated by inflammation/related pathways) and 6 were downregulated (dominated by metabolic pathways). Analysis of additional gene families identified significant differences for genes in the solute carrier family, RPE signature genes, and genes with potential role in age-related macular degeneration. These data indicate that loss of LC3b induces robust changes in the RPE transcriptome contributing to lipid dysregulation and metabolic imbalance, RPE atrophy, inflammation, and disease pathophysiology.",

Here, mass spectrometry-based global phosphoproteomics revealed that CXCR3 chemokines generate different phosphorylation barcodes associated with differential transducer activation. Chemokine stimulation resulted in distinct changes throughout the kinome in global phosphoproteomic studies. Mutation of CXCR3 phosphosites altered {beta}-arrestin conformation in cellular assays and was confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations.

    "abstract": "SummaryStochastic origin activation gives rise to significant cell-to-cell variability in the pattern of genome replication. The molecular basis for heterogeneity in efficiency and timing of individual origins is a long-standing question. Here, we developed Methylation Accessibility of TArgeted Chromatin domain Sequencing (MATAC-Seq) to determine single-molecule chromatin accessibility of specific genomic loci after targeted purification in their native chromatin context. Applying MATAC-Seq to selected early-efficient (EE) and late-inefficient (LI) budding yeast replication origins revealed large heterogeneity of chromatin states. Disruption of INO80 or ISW2 chromatin remodeling complexes leads to changes at individual nucleosomal positions that correlate with changes in their replication efficiency. We found a chromatin state with an optimal 100-115bp nucleosome-free region in combination with surrounding well-positioned nucleosomes and open +2 linker region is a strong predictor for efficient origin activation. Thus, MATAC-Seq identifies the large spectrum of alternative chromatin states that co-exist on a given locus previously masked in population-based experiments and provides a mechanistic basis for origin activation heterogeneity during DNA replication of eukaryotic cells. Consequently, our single-molecule assay for chromatin accessibility will be ideal to define single-molecule heterogeneity across many fundamental biological processes such as transcription, replication, or DNA repair in vitro and ex vivo.",

    "abstract": "Protein condensation regulates numerous cellular processes, but how it participates in the organization of microtubule architectures is unclear. Using synthetic biology approaches to manipulate human Tubulin polymerization-promoting protein (TPPP), we find a microtubule-binding domain and phase-separation motif are sufficient for higher-order microtubule bundling. In vitro, native or engineered TPPP phase transitions create multivalent structures that bind and bridge microtubules together. In cells, synthetic modulation of TPPP condensation regulates the strength and lifetime of its microtubule interaction. Surprisingly, cell-scale microtubule assemblies develop when TPPP is connected to synthetic droplets derived from unrelated sequences, mimicking its native localization at Golgi outposts. Systematically targeting TPPP variants to droplet hubs with different biophysical properties defines a two-level scheme for TPPP-regulated microtubule assembly operating at both the nanoscale (microtubule-binding affinity) and microscale (droplet strength). We suggest protein condensates can serve as general-purpose regulatable multivalent bridges for biophysically organizing or engineering microtubule architectures across cellular length-scales.",

    "abstract": "To advance the sustainability of the biobased economy, our society needs to develop novel bioprocesses based on truly renewable resources. The C1-molecule formate is increasingly proposed as carbon and energy source for microbial fermentations, as it can be efficiently generated electrochemically from CO2 and renewable energy. Yet, its biotechnological conversion into value-added compounds has been limited to a handful of examples. In this work, we engineered the natural formatotrophic bacterium C. necator as cell factory to enable biological conversion of formate into crotonate, a platform short-chain unsaturated carboxylic acid of biotechnological relevance. First, we developed a small-scale (150-mL working volume) cultivation setup for growing C. necator in minimal medium using formate as only carbon and energy source. By using a fed-batch strategy with automatic feeding of formic acid, we could increase final biomass concentrations 15-fold compared to batch cultivations in flasks. Then, we engineered a heterologous crotonate pathway in the bacterium via a modular approach, where each pathway section was assessed using multiple candidates. The best performing modules included a malonyl-CoA bypass for increasing the thermodynamic drive towards the intermediate acetoacetyl-CoA and subsequent conversion to crotonyl-CoA through partial reverse {beta}-oxidation. This pathway architecture was then tested for formate-based biosynthesis in our fed-batch setup, resulting in a two-fold higher titer, three-fold higher productivity, and five-fold higher yield compared to the strain not harboring the bypass. Eventually, we reached a maximum product titer of 148.0 {+/-} 6.8 mg/L. Altogether, this work consists in a proof-of-principle integrating bioprocess and metabolic engineering approaches for the biological upgrading of formate into a value-added platform chemical.",

    "abstract": "Aging progressively modifies the physiological balance of the organism increasing susceptibility to both genetic and sporadic neurodegenerative diseases. These changes include epigenetic chromatin remodeling events that may modify gene transcription. However, how aging interconnects with disease-causing genes is not well known. Here, we found that Su(var)3-9 causes increased methylation of histone H3K9 in the promoter region of TDP-43, the most frequently altered factor in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), affecting the mRNA and protein expression levels of this gene through epigenetic modifications in chromatin organization that appear to be conserved in aged Drosophila brains, mouse and human cells. Remarkably, augmented Su(var)3-9 activity causes a decrease in TDP-43 expression followed by early defects in locomotor activities. In contrast, decreasing Su(var)3-9 action promotes higher levels of TDP-43 expression and reinvigorates motility parameters in old flies, uncovering a novel role of this enzyme in regulating TDP-43 expression and locomotor senescence. The data indicate how conserved epigenetic mechanisms may link aging with neuronal diseases and suggest that Su(var)3-9 may play a role in the pathogenesis of ALS.",

    "abstract": "Insertion sequences (IS) are compact and pervasive transposable elements found in bacteria, which encode only the genes necessary for their mobilization and maintenance. IS200/IS605 elements undergo  peel-and-paste transposition catalyzed by a TnpA transposase, but intriguingly, they also encode diverse, TnpB- and IscB-family proteins that are evolutionarily related to the CRISPR-associated effectors Cas12 and Cas9, respectively. Recent studies demonstrated that TnpB-family enzymes function as RNA-guided DNA endonucleases, but the broader biological role of this activity has remained enigmatic. Here we show that TnpB/IscB are essential to prevent permanent transposon loss as a consequence of the TnpA transposition mechanism. We selected a family of related IS elements from Geobacillus stearothermophilus that encode diverse TnpB/IscB orthologs, and showed that a single TnpA transposase was active for transposon excision. The donor joints formed upon religation of IS-flanking sequences were efficiently targeted for cleavage by RNA-guided TnpB/IscB nucleases, and co-expression of TnpB together with TnpA led to significantly greater transposon retention, relative to conditions in which TnpA was expressed alone. Remarkably, TnpA and TnpB/IscB recognize the same AT-rich transposon-adjacent motif (TAM) during transposon excision and RNA-guided DNA cleavage, respectively, revealing a striking convergence in the evolution of DNA sequence specificity between collaborating transposase and nuclease proteins. Collectively, our study reveals that RNA-guided DNA cleavage is a primal biochemical activity that arose to bias the selfish inheritance and spread of transposable elements, which was later co-opted during the evolution of CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity for antiviral defense.",

The divergence dating suggested that the most common ancestor (TMRCA) of each rodent species was estimated in Early or Middle Pleistocene.

Additionally, the six rodent species range of refugia area in the LGM projected by ecological niche models (ENMs) exhibited expander than the suitable area on present, meanwhile the remaining four rodent species showed contracted refugia regions.
