    "abstract": "Sleep is a nearly universal feature of animal behaviour, yet many of the molecular, genetic, and neuronal substrates that orchestrate sleep/wake transitions lie undiscovered. Employing a viral insertion sleep screen in larval zebrafish, we identified a novel gene, dreammist (dmist), whose loss results in behavioural hyperactivity and reduced sleep at night. The neuronally expressed dmist gene is conserved across vertebrates and encodes a small single-pass transmembrane protein that is structurally similar to the Na+,K+-ATPase regulator, FXYD1/Phospholemman. Disruption of either fxyd1 or atp1a3a, a Na+,K+-ATPase alpha-3 subunit associated with several heritable movement disorders in humans, led to decreased night-time sleep. Since atpa1a3a and dmist mutants have elevated intracellular Na+ levels and non-additive effects on sleep amount at night, we propose that Dmist-dependent enhancement of Na+ pump function modulates neuronal excitability to maintain normal sleep behaviour.\n\nSignificance statementSleep is an essential behavioral state, but the genes that regulate sleep and wake states are still being uncovered. A viral insertion screen in zebrafish identified a novel sleep mutant called dreammist, in which a small, highly-conserved transmembrane protein is disrupted. The discovery of dreammist highlights the importance of a class of small transmembrane-protein modulators of the sodium pump in setting appropriate sleep duration.",

    "abstract": "Clinical signs of American Foulbrood (AFB) can be difficult to diagnose and thus disease is often missed and leads to further spread. Diagnosis is centred on the beekeepers skill in recognising clinical symptoms - a highly subjective and time-consuming activity. Previous testing methods have relied on sampling that necessitates dismantling the hive and/or requires multiple visits to retrieve passive samples. The Foster method is a novel environmental DNA sampling method using colony entrance swabs together with a dual-target qPCR for Paenibacillus larvae: the causative bacteria of AFB disease. The quantification data generated can be used to detect hives with clinically significant infections, even before visual symptoms are apparent. Such a sampling method will be applicable to other bee pathogens and incursion pests.\n\nImportanceDiscovery of American foulbrood disease in a honeybee colony typically means the destruction of the bees and hive by burning, in New Zealand and many other countries. This discovery is typically by visual examination of capped brood by the beekeeper - a subjective skill that means the disease is being missed or not recognised. It is a time-consuming and exacting process to inspect hives for AFB. Here we present a novel rapid sampling method that does not require opening/ dismantling the hive, in conjunction with a dual-target quantitative PCR assay for the bacteria responsible, Paenibacillus larvae. Using the resulting quantitative data, hives presenting visual clinical symptoms or likely to soon become clinical, can be determined and the hives dealt with appropriately before further spread occurs. This study provides the basis for a novel way of sampling for honeybee pathogens and pests.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how the collective physical processes drive robust morphological transitions in animal development requires the characterization of the relevant fields underlying morphogenesis. Calcium (Ca2+) is known to be such a field. Here we show that the Ca2+ spatial fluctuations, in whole-body Hydra regeneration, exhibit universal properties captured by a field-theoretic model describing fluctuations in a tilted double-well potential. We utilize an external electric field and Heptanol, a drug blocking gap junctions, as two separate controls affecting the Ca2+ activity and pausing the regeneration process in a reversible way. Subjecting the Hydra tissue to an electric field increases the calcium activity and its spatial correlations, while applying Heptanol inhibits the activity and weakens the spatial correlations. The statistical characteristics of the Ca2+ spatial fluctuations - i.e., the coefficient of variation and the skewness - exhibit universal shape distributions across tissue samples and conditions, demonstrating the existence of global constraints over this field. Our analysis shows that the Hydras tissue resides near the onset of bistability; the local Ca2+ activity in different regions fluctuates between low and high excited states. The controls modulate the dynamics near that onset, preserving the universal characteristics of the Ca2+ fluctuations and, by that, maintaining the tissues ability to regenerate.",

    "abstract": "Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs), a class of heterobifunctional molecules that recruit target proteins to E3 ligases, have gained traction for targeted protein degradation. However, pomalidomide, a widely used E3 ligase recruiter in PROTACs, can independently degrade other targets, such as zinc-finger (ZF) proteins, that hold key functions in normal development and disease progression. This off-target degradation of pomalidomide-based PROTACs raises concerns about their therapeutic applicability and long-term side effects. Therefore, there is a crucial need to develop rules for PROTAC design that minimize off-target degradation. In this study, we developed a high-throughput platform that interrogates the off-target degradation of ZF domains and discovered, using this platform, that PROTACs with the current design paradigm induce degradation of several ZF proteins. To identify new rules for PROTAC design, we generated a library of pomalidomide analogs that allowed systematic exploration of the impact of positional isomerism (e.g., C4 and C5 positions of the phthalimide ring), hydrogen bonding, steric and hydrophobic effects on propensities for ZF protein degradation. We found that modifications of appropriate size on the C5 position reduced off-target ZF degradation. We validated these results using immunoblotting, target engagement, and global mass spectrometric studies. We applied our newfound design principles on a previously developed ALK oncoprotein-targeting PROTAC and generated PROTACs with enhanced potency and minimal off-target degradation. We envision the reported off-target profiling platform and pomalidomide analogs will find utility in design of specific PROTACs.",

    "abstract": "In human gait, the bodys mechanical energy at the end of one step is reused to achieve forward progression during the subsequent step, thereby reducing the required muscle work. During the single stance phase, humans rely on the largely uncontrolled passive inverted pendular motion of the body to perpetuate forward motion. These passive body dynamics, while improving walking efficiency, also indicate that lower passive dynamic stability in the anterior direction since the individual will be less able to withstand a forward external perturbation. Here we test the novel hypothesis that humans manipulate passive anterior-posterior (AP) stability via active selection of step length to either achieve energy-efficient gait or to improve stability when it is threatened. We computed the AP margin of stability, which quantifies the passive dynamic stability of gait, for multiple steps as healthy young adults (N=20) walked on a clear and on an obstructed walkway. Participants used passive dynamics to achieve energy-efficient gait for all but one step; when crossing the obstacle with the leading limb, AP margin of stability was increased. This increase indicated caution to offset the greater risk of falling after a potential trip. Furthermore, AP margin of stability increased while approaching the obstacle, indicating that humans proactively manipulate the passive dynamics to meet the demands of the locomotor task. Finally, the step length and the center of mass motion co-varied to maintain the AP margin of stability for all steps in both tasks at the specific values for each step. We conclude that humans actively regulate step length to maintain specific levels of passive dynamic stability for each step during unobstructed and obstructed gait.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the impact of DNA variation on human traits is a fundamental question in human genetics. Variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) make up roughly 3% of the human genome but are often excluded from association analysis due to poor read mappability or divergent repeat content. While methods exist to estimate VNTR length from short-read data, it is known that VNTRs vary in both length and repeat (motif) composition. Here, we use a repeat-pangenome graph (RPGG) constructed on 35 haplotype-resolved assemblies to detect variation in both VNTR length and repeat composition. We align population scale data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Consortium to examine how variations in sequence composition may be linked to expression, including cases independent of overall VNTR length. We find that 9,422 out of 39,125 VNTRs are associated with nearby gene expression through motif variations, of which only 23.4% associations are accessible from length. Fine-mapping identifies 174 genes to be likely driven by variation in certain VNTR motifs and not overall length. We highlight two genes, CACNA1C and RNF213 that have expression associated with motif variation, demonstrating the utility of RPGG analysis as a new approach for trait association in multiallelic and highly variable loci.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutic targeting of dysregulated transcriptional programs has arisen as a promising strategy for the treatment of leukaemias. The therapeutic response to small molecule inhibitors of Bromodomain-Containing Proteins (BRD), such as BRD2 and BRD4, P300/cAMP-response element binding protein (CBP) and Cyclin Dependent Kinases (CDKs), is generally attributed to the selective disruption of oncogenic gene expression networks driven by enhancers, super-enhancers (SEs) and lineage-specific transcription factors (TFs), including the c-MYC oncogene. Using technologies such as thiol (SH)-linked alkylation for the metabolic sequencing of RNA sequencing (SLAM-seq) to profile messenger RNA (mRNA) decay and production rates, we demonstrate that gene intrinsic properties largely govern the selectivity associated with transcriptional inhibition, where total mRNA response signatures are dominated with genes that have short transcript half-lives, including those regulated by SEs and oncogenic TFs. Further highlighting that gene sensitivities only occur in the context of short transcript half-lives, stabilisation of the c-MYC transcript through changes in the 3 UTR rendered it insensitive to transcriptional targeting. However, this was not sufficient to rescue c-MYC target gene transcription and anti-leukaemia effects following transcriptional inhibition. Importantly, long-lived mRNAs encoding essential genes that evade transcriptional targeting can be rendered sensitive via modulation of mRNA decay kinetics through inhibition of the RNA Binding Protein (RBP), ELAV Like RNA binding protein 1 (ELAVL1)/ Human Antigen R (HuR). Taken together, these data demonstrate that mRNA decay shapes the therapeutic response to transcriptional perturbation and can be modulated for novel therapeutic outcomes using transcriptional agents in leukaemia.",

    "abstract": "Heterospecific communication is common for birds when mobbing a predator. However, joining the mob should depend on the number of callers already enrolled, as larger mobs imply lower individual risks for the newcomer. In addition, some  community informant species seem more reliable regarding the information transferred in mobbing calls. Birds should therefore rely on both the number of callers and the species identity of the caller(s) when mobbing. In the present study, we tested the potential interaction between two acoustic cues. In a playback experiment, we modified the number of callers (through an increased number of calling individuals correlated to an increased duty cycle) and the emitter species (crested tits versus coal tits). Overall, we found that soundtracks with three callers triggered more mobbing than soundtracks with one caller and that soundtracks with coal tits calls triggered more mobbing than soundtracks with crested tits calls. Our results therefore support the hypothesis that birds consider both the species and the number of callers when joining a mobbing chorus in winter. Finally, we replicated the experiment in spring and did not record the same responses from the bird community. Indeed, only soundtracks with three coal tits triggered a mobbing response, suggesting therefore that the seasonal context can affect the results of studies on heterospecific communication. The potential mechanisms implicated in the varying responses to different acoustic cues and different seasons are discussed and should deserve further investigations.",

    "abstract": "Lipid environments can be chemically impacted by peroxynitrite (ONOO-), a reactive species generated under nitrative stress. Molecular tools used for investigating ONOO- reactivity in biological membranes remain underdeveloped, available probes lack the ability of subcellular localization, and the standard methods for detecting ONOO- in vivo are indirect. Here we investigated ONOO- in diverse lipid environments (biomimetic giant vesicles, live mammalian cells, and within the lung lining) using a biocompatible and membrane-localized phospholipid named DPPC-TC-ONOO-. This designer lipid and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine self-assemble to giant vesicles that respond to ONOO- by generating fluorescence. These vesicles remain intact after sensing ONOO- and exhibit excellent selectivity against other redox species. We delivered DPPC-TC-ONOO- into live HeLa and RAW cells via lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Cytokine-induced nitrative stress led to enhanced fluorescence of the lipid clusters, primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum. These LNPs allowed the detection of ONOO- reactivity and nitrative stress around bronchioles within precision cut lung slices in response to acute lung injury (ALI). Furthermore, the use of the LNPs allowed for the detection of pulmonary macrophages from bronchoalveolar lavage following ALI in C57BL6/J but not in Nos2-/- mice. These investigations revealed significant advantages of DPPC-TC-ONOO- over its non-amphiphilic analog. Our work presents (i) an unprecedented function for biomimetic membranes, (ii) the potential of LNPs for delivering designer lipids into cells and tissues, (iii) real-time imaging of endogenous ONOO- at the organelle level in mammalian cells, and (iv) a direct method of studying nitrative stress due to ALI ex vivo and in vivo.",

Both sexes showed ID-induced alterations in gene networks leading to enhanced neuroinflammation. In females, ID-induced changes indicating enhanced activity of oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid metabolism, which are contrary to the ID effect in males. Prenatal choline supplementation induced the most robust changes in gene expression, particularly in the iron-deficient animals where it partially rescued ID-induced dysregulations.

However, the biological/environmental factors determining the efficiency of this immune system have yet to be fully characterized. Recent studies in cultured bacteria showed that slowing the growth rate of bacterial cells could promote their acquisition of novel spacers. This study examined the relationship between the CRISPR-Cas content and the minimal doubling time across the bacteria and the archaea domains. Every completely sequenced genome could be used to predict a minimal doubling time. With a large dataset of 4142 bacterial samples, we found that the predicted minimal doubling times are positively correlated with spacer number and other parameters of the CRISPR-Cas systems, like array number, Cas gene cluster number, and Cas gene number. Different datasets gave different results. Weak results were obtained in analyzing bacterial empirical minimal doubling times and the archaea domain. Still, the conclusion of more spacers in slowly-grown prokaryotes was supported. In addition, we found that the minimal doubling times are negatively correlated with the occurrence of prophages, and the spacer numbers per array are negatively associated with the number of prophages. These observations support the existence of an evolutionary trade-off between bacterial growth and adaptive defense against virulent phages.",

    "abstract": "Species interactions play a fundamental role in ecosystems. However, few ecological communities have complete data describing such interactions, which is an obstacle to understanding how ecosystems function and respond to perturbations. Because it is often impractical to collect empirical data for all interactions in a community, various methods have been developed to infer interactions. Machine learning is increasingly being used for making interaction predictions, with random forest being one of the most frequently used of these methods. However, performance of random forest in inferring predator-prey interactions in terrestrial vertebrates and its sensitivity to training data quality remain untested. We examined predator-prey interactions in two diverse, primarily terrestrial vertebrate classes: birds and mammals. Combining data from a global interaction dataset and a specific community (Simpson Desert, Australia), we tested how well random forest predicted predator-prey interactions for mammals and birds using species ecomorphological and phylogenetic traits. We also tested how variation in training data quality--manipulated by removing records and switching interaction records to non-interactions--affected model performance. We found that random forest could predict predator-prey interactions for birds and mammals using ecomorphological or phylogenetic traits, correctly predicting up to 88% and 67% of interactions and non-interactions in the global and community-specific datasets, respectively. These predictions were accurate even when there were no records in the training data for focal species. In contrast, false non-interactions for focal predators in training data strongly degraded model performance. Our results demonstrate that random forest can identify predator-prey interactions for birds and mammals that have few or no interaction records. Furthermore, our study provides guidance on how to prepare training data to optimise machine-learning classifiers for predicting species interactions, which could help ecologists (i) address knowledge gaps and explore network-related questions in data-poor situations, and (ii) predict interactions for range-expanding species.",

    "abstract": "Nucleic acids can act as potent modulators of protein aggregation, and RNA is able to either hinder or facilitate protein assembly depending on the molecular context. Here we used a computational approach to characterize the physico-chemical properties of regions involved in amyloid aggregation. In different experimental datasets we observed that, while the core is hydrophobic and highly ordered, external regions, more disordered, display a distinct tendency to interact with nucleic acids.\n\nTo validate our predictions, we performed aggregation assays with -synuclein (aS140), a non-nucleic acid binding amyloidogenic protein, and a mutant truncated at the acidic C-terminus (aS103) that is predicted to sequester RNA. For both aS140 and aS103 we observed acceleration of the aggregation upon RNA addition with a significantly stronger effect for aS103. Due to the favorable electrostatics, we observed enhanced nucleic-acid sequestration ability for aS103 that entrapped a larger amount of RNA.\n\nOverall, our research suggests that RNA sequestration is a rather common phenomenon linked to protein aggregation and constitutes a gain-of-function mechanism to be further investigated.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEOur study indicates that aggregation confers RNA-binding ability to non-RNA-binding proteins such as alpha synuclein. The sequestration of RNA upon protein aggregation might alter RNA homeostasis and impact multiple biochemical cascades.",

Existing simulators typically focus on modeling one or two specific biological factors or mechanisms that affect the output data, which limits their capacity to simulate the complexity and multi-modality in real data. Here, we present scMultiSim, an in silico simulator that generates multi-modal single-cell data, including gene expression, chromatin accessibility, RNA velocity, and spatial cell locations while accounting for the relationships between modalities. scMultiSim jointly models various biological factors that affect the output data, including cell identity, within-cell gene regulatory networks (GRNs), cell-cell interactions (CCIs), and chromatin accessibility, while also incorporating technical noises. Moreover, it allows users to adjust each factors effect easily. We validated scMultiSims simulated biological effects and demonstrated its applications by benchmarking a wide range of computational tasks, including cell clustering and trajectory inference, multi-modal and multi-batch data integration, RNA velocity estimation, GRN inference and CCI inference using spatially resolved gene expression data. Compared to existing simulators, scMultiSim can benchmark a much broader range of existing computational problems and even new potential tasks.",

While the most time- and memory-intensive step of OLC --the all-vs-all sequencing read alignment process-- was improved and reimplemented in modern long read assemblers, these tools still often require excessive computational memory when assembling a typical 50X human genome dataset.\n\nResultsHere we present GoldRush, a de novo genome assembly algorithm with linear time complexity in the number of input long sequencing reads. We tested GoldRush on Oxford Nanopore Technologies datasets with different base error profiles describing the genomes of three human cell lines (NA24385, HG01243 and HG02055), Oryza sativa (rice), and Solanum lycopersicum (tomato). GoldRush achieved NGA50 lengths of 18.3-22.2 Mbp for the three human datasets, with two of the three assemblies having the fewest extensive misassemblies, and NGA50 lengths of 0.3 and 2.6 Mbp for the 373 Mbp and 824 Mbp genomes of rice and tomato, respectively. Further, GoldRush assembled all genomes within a day, using at most 54.5 GB of RAM. These results demonstrate that our algorithm and new assembly paradigm can be used to assemble large genomes de novo efficiently in compute memory space, with resulting assembly contiguity comparable to that of state-of-the-art OLC genome assemblers.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/bcgsc/goldrush",

    "abstract": "Intra-tissue genetic heterogeneity is universal to both healthy and cancerous tissues. It emerges from the stochastic accumulation of somatic mutations throughout development and homeostasis. By combining population genetics theory and genomic information, genetic heterogeneity can be exploited to infer tissue organisation and dynamics in vivo. However, many basic quantities, for example the dynamics of tissue specific stem cells remain difficult to quantify precisely. Here we show that single cell and bulk sequencing data inform on different aspects of the underlying stochastic processes. Bulk derived variant allele frequency spectra (VAF) show transitions from growing to constant stem cell populations with age in samples of healthy oesophagus epithelium. Single-cell mutational burden distributions allow a sample size independent measure of mutation and proliferation rates. Mutation rates in adult haematopietic stem cells are higher compared to inferences during development, suggesting additional proliferation independent effects. Furthermore, single cell derived VAF spectra contain information on the number of tissue specific stem cells. In haematopiesis, we find approximately 2 x 105 HSCs, if all stem cells divide symmetrically. However, the single cell mutational burden distribution is over-dispersed compared to a model of Poisson distributed random mutations suggesting currently unknown processes induce additional stochasticity. Possible candidates for these processes may be occasional bursts of stem cell divisions, potentially in response to injury, or non-constant mutation rates either through environmental exposures or cell intrinsic variation.",

During LD biogenesis, perilipin 3 (PLIN3) is recruited to nascent LDs as they emerge from the endoplasmic reticulum. Here, we analyzed how lipid composition affects PLIN3 recruitment to membrane bilayers and LDs, and the structural changes that occur upon membrane binding. We found the TAG precursors phosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol (DAG) recruit PLIN3 to membrane bilayers and define an expanded Perilipin-ADRP-Tip47 (PAT) domain that preferentially binds DAG enriched membranes. Membrane binding induces a disorder/order transition of alpha helices within the PAT domain and 11-mer repeats, with intramolecular distance measurements consistent with the expanded PAT domain adopting a folded but dynamic structure upon membrane binding. In cells, PLIN3 is recruited to DAG enriched ER membranes, and this requires both the PAT domain and 11-mer repeats. This provides molecular details of PLIN3 recruitment to nascent LDs and identifies a function of the PAT domain of PLIN3 in DAG binding.",

We developed automated tools to support such research generically and demonstrated its applicability on two other scientific fields we have previously studied - COVID-19 and Circadian clocks. This method makes use of Wikipedia as a digital and free archive, documenting the incremental growth of knowledge and the manner scientific research accumulates and translates into public discourse.

In California, genotypes of homokaryotic mushrooms are also found in heterokaryotic mushrooms, implying nuclei of homokaryotic mycelia also promote outcrossing. We discovered death cap mating is controlled by a single mating-type locus (A. phalloides is bipolar), but the development of homokaryotic mushrooms appears to bypass mating-type gene control. Ultimately, sporulation is enabled by nuclei able to reproduce alone as well as with others, and nuclei competent for both unisexuality and bisexuality have persisted in invaded habitats for at least 17 but potentially as long as 30 years. The diverse reproductive strategies of invasive death caps are likely facilitating its rapid spread, revealing a profound similarity between plant, animal and fungal invasions2,3.",

    "abstract": "Folding of ribozymes into well-defined tertiary structures usually requires divalent cations. How Mg2+ ions direct the folding kinetics has been a long-standing unsolved problem because experiments cannot detect the positions and dynamics of ions. To address this problem, we used molecular simulations to dissect the folding kinetics of the Azoarcus ribozyme by monitoring the path each molecule takes to reach the folded state. We quantitatively establish that Mg2+ binding to specific sites, coupled with counter-ion release of monovalent cations, stimulate the formation of secondary and tertiary structures, leading to diverse pathways that include direct rapid folding and trapping in misfolded structures. In some molecules, key tertiary structural elements form when Mg2+ ions bind to specific RNA sites at the earliest stages of the folding, leading to specific collapse and rapid folding. In others, the formation of non-native base pairs, whose rearrangement is needed to reach the folded state, is the rate-limiting step. Escape from energetic traps, driven by thermal fluctuations, occurs readily. In contrast, the transition to the native state from long-lived topologically trapped native-like metastable states is extremely slow. Specific collapse and formation of energetically or topologically frustrated states occur early in the assembly process.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=108 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/527349v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a69418org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@144e1a3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@139b8e2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@993ca2_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Spanning the tissue transparency window, the near-infrared (NIR) photoluminescence (PL) of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) can optically penetrate biological tissue for deep-tissue imaging and optical sensing. SWCNTs are often functionalized with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to yield biocompatible, responsive, and selective sensors. However, the low brightness of these ssDNA-wrapped SWCNTs sensors restricts the depth at which such sensors can be implanted in the tissue. This work demonstrates the PL enhancement of ssDNA-wrapped SWCNTs by incorporating biocompatible graphene quantum dots (GQDs). Two kinds of GQDs, pristine (PGQDs) and nitrogen-doped (NGQDs), were fabricated and characterized. Thermodynamically, both GQDs were shown to significantly increase the fluorescence efficiency of ssDNA-SWCNTs with the same degree of PL enhancement after 3 h. Furthermore, a correlation between the diameter of the SWCNTs and the PL enhancement factor was found; the larger the SWCNT diameter, the higher the PL increase upon adding GQDs. For instance, a 30-fold enhancement was achieved for (8,6) chirality while it was only 2-fold for the (6,5) chirality. Our experiments showed that adding GQDs increases the surface coverage of SWCNTs suspended by ssDNA, limiting water molecules access to the nanotube surface, thus increasing the fluorescence efficiency. Kinetically, NGQDs brightened SWCNTs much faster than PGQDs. The PL intensity reached a plateau in 2 min following the addition of NGQDs, while it was still increasing even after 1 h upon the addition of PGQDs. We show that NGQDs can act as reducing agents to decrease the amount of dissolved oxygen, which quenches the SWCNTs PL. This advancement provides a promising tool for engineering the brightness of NIR sensors for biomedical applications such as single-molecule imaging of individual SWCNTs using NIR confocal microscopy and deep tissue sensing.",

    "abstract": "Pericentromeric heterochromatin is highly enriched for repetitive sequences prone to aberrant recombination. Previous studies showed that homologous recombination (HR) repair is uniquely regulated in this domain to enable  safe repair while preventing aberrant recombination. In Drosophila cells, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) relocalize to the nuclear periphery through nuclear actin-driven directed motions before recruiting the strand invasion protein Rad51 and completing HR repair. End-joining (EJ) repair also occurs with high frequency in heterochromatin of fly tissues, but how alternative EJ (alt-EJ) pathways operate in heterochromatin remains largely uncharacterized. Here, we induce DSBs in single euchromatic and heterochromatic sites using a new system that combines the DR-white reporter and I-SceI expression in spermatogonia of flies. Using this approach, we detect higher frequency of HR repair in heterochromatin, relative to euchromatin. Further, sequencing of mutagenic repair junctions reveals the preferential use of different EJ pathways across distinct euchromatic and heterochromatic sites. Interestingly, synthesis-dependent microhomology-mediated end joining (SD-MMEJ) appears differentially regulated in the two domains, with a preferential use of motifs close to the cut site in heterochromatin relative to euchromatin, resulting in smaller deletions. Together, these studies establish a new approach to study repair outcomes in fly tissues, and support the conclusion that heterochromatin uses more HR and less mutagenic EJ repair relative to euchromatin.",

It has been hypothesized that these changes might be functionally related to the known outcomes of prenatal and early life CS exposure, which include impaired lung development, altered lung function and increased risk of asthma and wheeze. However, to date, few studies have examined DNAm changes induced by prenatal CS in tissues of the lung, and even fewer have attempted to examine the specific influences of prenatal versus early postnatal exposures. Here, we have established a mouse model of CS exposure which isolates the effects of prenatal and early postnatal CS exposures in early life. We have used this model to measure the effects of prenatal and/or postnatal CS exposures on lung function and immune cell infiltration as well as DNAm and expression of Cyp1a1, a candidate gene previously observed to demonstrate DNAm differences upon CS exposure in humans. Our study revealed that exposure to CS prenatally and in the early postnatal period cause long-lasting differences in offspring lung function, gene expression and lung Cyp1a1 DNAm, which wane over time but are reestablished upon re-exposure to CS in adulthood. This study creates a testable mouse model which can be used to investigate the effects of prenatal and early postnatal CS exposures and will contribute to the design of intervention strategies to mediate these detrimental effects.",

    "abstract": "Nonhuman primates (NHPs) exhibit complex and diverse behavior that typifies advanced cognitive function and social communication, but quantitative and systematical measure of this natural nonverbal processing has been a technical challenge. Specifically, a method is required to automatically segment time series of behavior into elemental motion motifs, much like finding meaningful words in character strings. Here, we propose a solution called SyntacticMotionParser (SMP), a general-purpose unsupervised behavior parsing algorithm using a non-parametric Bayesian model. Using three-dimensional posture-tracking data from NHPs, SMP automatically outputs an optimized sequence of latent motion motifs classified into the most likely number of states. When applied to behavioral datasets from common marmosets and rhesus monkeys, SMP outperformed conventional posture-clustering models and detected a set of behavioral ethograms from publicly available data. SMP also quantified and visualized the behavioral effects of chemogenetic neural manipulations. SMP thus has the potential to dramatically improve our understanding of natural NHP behavior in a variety of contexts.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered proteins are a class of proteins that lack stable folded conformations and instead adopt a range of conformations that determine their biochemical functions. The temperature-dependent behaviour of such disordered proteins is complex and can vary depending on the specific protein and environment. Here, we have used molecular dynamics simulations and previously published experimental data to investigate the temperature-dependent behaviour of Histatin 5, a 24-residue-long polypeptide. We examined the hypothesis that Histatin 5 undergoes a loss of polyproline II structure with increasing temperature, leading to more compact conformations. We found that the conformational ensembles generated by the simulations generally agree with small-angle X-ray scattering data for Histatin 5, but show some discrepancies with the hydrodynamic radius as probed by pulsed-field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and with the secondary structure information derived from circular dichroism. We attempted to reconcile these differences by reweighting the conformational ensembles against the scattering and NMR data. By doing so, we were in part able to capture the temperature-dependent behaviour of Histatin 5 and to link the observed decrease in hydrodynamic radius with increasing temperature to a loss of polyproline II structure. We were, however, unable to achieve agreement with both the scattering and NMR data within experimental errors. We discuss different possibilities for this outcome including inaccuracies in the force field, differences in conditions of the NMR and scattering experiments, and issues related to the calculation of the hydrodynamic radius from conformational ensembles. Our study highlights the importance of integrating multiple types of experimental data when modelling conformational ensembles of disordered proteins and how environmental factors such as the temperature influence them.",

    "abstract": "Slow deactivation is a critical biophysical and physiological property of voltage-gated K+ channels encoded by the human Ether-a-go-go-Related Gene (hERG). hERG channel deactivation is modulated by interactions between intracellular N-terminal Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) and C-terminal cyclic nucleotide-binding homology (CNBh) domains. The PAS domain is multipartite, comprising a globular domain (residues 26-136) and an N-terminal PAS-cap that is further subdivided into an initial unstructured segment (residues 1-12) and an amphipathic -helical region (residues 13-25). Disruption of interactions within the PAS-CNBhD complex accelerates deactivation kinetics and impairs the slow repolarization of the cardiac action potential. Similarly, deletion of the PAS-cap unstructured segment, modeled as a \"foot-in-the-door,\" accelerates channel closing. Here, we tested the hypothesis that a three-dimensional hydrophobic nexus, comprising residues in the PAS-cap -helix, the globular PAS, and CNBh domains, plays a crucial role in slow deactivation. Utilizing structure-directed mutagenesis, electrophysiology, and molecular dynamics simulations, we provide evidence that altering hydrophobicity at this interface accelerates deactivation kinetics and causes a rearrangement in the network of residues comprising the hydrophobic nexus. Moreover, the PAS-cap unstructured segment disengages from the gating machinery. We propose that the nexus hydrophobicity positions the PAS-cap -helix and promotes engagement of the upstream PAS-cap unstructured segment with the gating machinery, resulting in slow channel closing. Interestingly, several long QT syndrome disease mutations lie at this interface, underscoring the importance of the hydrophobic nexus and the novel role of the PAS-cap -helix in hERG gating.",

Analytic solutions have been developed for specific, well-defined models of dynamic behavior in idealized geometries, but these solutions are inaccurate in complex geometries or when complex binding and diffusion behaviors exist. We demonstrate the use of numerical reaction-diffusion simulation approaches using the easily accessible Virtual Cell (VCell) software, to establish methods for analyzing photobleaching data. We show how multiple simulations employing parameter scans and varying bleaching locations and sizes can help to bracket diffusion coefficients and kinetic rate constants. This approach is applied to problems in membrane surface diffusion, diffusion and binding in cytosolic volumes in complex cell geometries, and analysis of diffusion and binding in intracellular liquid droplets.\n\nStatement of SignificanceFluorescence Redistribution After Photobleaching (FRAP) is a widely used experimental method that can reveal important parameters for reaction/diffusion events within cells.

    "abstract": "The meiotic chromosome axis coordinates chromosome organization and interhomolog recombination in meiotic prophase and is essential for fertility. In S. cerevisiae, the HORMAD protein Hop1 mediates enrichment of axis proteins at nucleosome-rich genomic islands through a central chromatin-binding region (CBR). Here, we use cryoelectron microscopy to show that the Hop1 CBR directly recognizes bent nucleosomal DNA through a composite interface in its PHD and winged helix-turn-helix domains. Targeted disruption of the Hop1 CBR-nucleosome interface causes loss of axis proteins from nucleosome-rich islands, reduces meiotic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), and leads to defects in chromosome synapsis. Synthetic effects with the disassemblase Pch2 suggest that nucleosome binding delays a conformational switch in Hop1 from a DSB-promoting, Pch2-inaccessible state to a DSB-inactive, Pch2-accessible state to regulate the extent of meiotic DSB formation. Phylogenetic analyses of meiotic HORMADs reveal an ancient origin of this domain, suggesting that these mechanisms are broadly conserved.",

    "abstract": "MerTK is a receptor tyrosine kinase that mediates the immunologically silent phagocytic uptake of diverse types of cellular debris. Highly expressed on the surface of microglial cell, MerTK is of importance in brain development, homeostasis, plasticity, and disease. Yet, involvement of this receptor in the clearance of protein aggregates that accumulate with aging and in neurodegenerative diseases has yet to be defined. The current study explored the function of MerTK in the microglial uptake of alpha-synuclein fibrils which play a causative role in the pathobiology of synucleinopathies.\n\nUsing human primary and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia, the MerTK- dependence of alpha-synuclein fibril internalization was investigated in vitro. Relevance of this pathway to synucleinopathies was assessed by analyzing MerTK expression in patient-derived cells and tissues.\n\nPharmacological inhibition of MerTK and siRNA-mediated MERTK knockdown both caused a decreased rate of alpha-synuclein fibril internalization by human microglia. Consistent with the immunologically silent nature of MerTK-mediated phagocytosis, alpha-synuclein fibril internalization did not induce secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines from microglia. In addition, burden analysis in two independent patient cohorts revealed a significant association between rare functionally deleterious MERTK variants and Parkinsons disease in one of the cohorts (p = 0.002). Accordingly, MERTK expression was significantly upregulated in nigral microglia from Parkinsons disease/Lewy body dementia patients compared to those from non-neurological control donors in a single-nuclei RNA-sequencing dataset (p = 5.08x10-21), and MerTK protein expression positively correlated with alpha-synuclein level in human cortex lysates (p = 0.0029).\n\nTaken together, our findings define a novel role for MerTK in mediating the uptake of alpha-synuclein aggregates by human microglia, with possible involvement in limiting alpha-synuclein spread in synucleinopathies such as Parkinsons disease.",

The pre-CD34-positive stem cells are spore-like, while the pre-mesenchymal stem cells are fusiform-shaped. All of them originate or released from tube-shaped tissue structures, or niches. In the current study, we present two membrane-like pre-stem progenitors. One of them had red thin membrane structures that were from disconnection of bamboo-like tissues and developed into thin membrane-like multi-nucleated cells. The other membrane-like structure had geometric-shape and was the place of developing numerous c-kit-positive stem cell progenitors. One geometric-shaped membrane could produce dozens to hundreds of progenitors in a synchronized pattern. Our findings provide more evidence that postnatal stem cells are unipotent and self-renewed in sealed tube-shaped structures. The tube-shaped structures released their inclusions that have distinct morphological differences among the cellular lineages. Thus, the self-renewal of each lineage-distinct stem cell has its unique pattern. Further, our data suggests that postnatal stem cells are renewed via a recurrent pattern. Our findings again challenged the old concepts of stem cell niche components, the origins of stem cell lineages and the self-renewal of stem cells.",

In rod photoreceptors, binding sites for the transcription factor (TF) Cone-rod homeobox (CRX) occur in both enhancers and silencers, but the sequence context that determines whether CRX binding sites contribute to activation or repression of transcription is not understood. To investigate the context-dependent activity of CRX sites, we fit neural network-based models to the activities of synthetic CREs composed of photoreceptor TFBSs. The models revealed that CRX binding sites consistently make positive, independent contributions to CRE activity, while negative homotypic interactions between sites cause CREs composed of multiple CRX sites to function as silencers. The effects of negative homotypic interactions can be overcome by the presence of other TFBSs that either interact cooperatively with CRX sites or make independent positive contributions to activity. The context-dependent activity of CRX sites is thus determined by the balance between positive heterotypic interactions, independent contributions of TFBSs, and negative homotypic interactions. Our findings explain observed patterns of activity among genomic CRX-bound enhancers and silencers, and suggest that enhancers may require diverse TFBSs to overcome negative homotypic interactions between TFBSs.",

We discovered that the bile metabolome is not only substantially more complex than appreciated but is dynamic and responsive to the microbiota and enteric infection. Hepatic transcriptomics identified enteric infection-triggered pathways that likely underlie bile remodeling. Enteric infections stimulated elevation of four dicarboxylates in bile that modulated intestinal gut epithelial and microbiota composition, inflammasome activation, and host defense.

    "abstract": "Many bacteria swim driven by an extracellular filament rotated by the bacterial flagellar motor. This motor is powered by the stator complex, MotA5MotB2, a heterodimeric complex which forms an ion channel which couples energy from the ion motive force to torque generation. Recent structural work revealed that stator complex consists of a ring of five MotA subunits which rotate around a central dimer of MotB subunits. Transmembrane (TM) domains TM3 and TM4 from MotA combine with the single TM domain from MotB to form two separate ion channels within this complex. Much is known about the ion binding site and ion specificity; however, to date, no modelling has been undertaken to explore the MotB-MotB dimer stability and the role of MotB conformational dynamics during rotation. Here, we modelled the central MotB dimer using coiled-coil engineering and modelling principles and calculated free energies to identify stable states in the operating cycle of the stator. We found 3 stable coiled-coil states with dimer interface angles of 28{degrees}, 56{degrees} and 64{degrees}. We tested the effect of strategic mutagenesis on the comparative energy of the states and correlated motility with a specific hierarchy of stability between the three states. In general, our results indicate agreement with existing models describing a 36{degrees} rotation step of the MotA pentameric ring during the power stroke and provide an energetic basis for the coordinated rotation of the central MotB dimer based on coiled-coil modelling.",

How naturally coexisting bacteria of the microbiota interact with each other is not yet fully understood. Here, we isolated formerly coexisting, closely related strains of the genus Bacteroides from the intestines of healthy, wild-derived mice. The effect of one strain on another strains growth was tested in 169 pairs in vitro. We find a vast diversity of growth promoting and growth inhibiting activities. A strong positive effect was observed between two strains with differing metabolisms. Growth inhibition among a subset of strains was associated with the known bacterial toxin bacteroidetocin B. Across all strains, we observed growth promotion more often than growth inhibition. The effects were independent of two strains belonging to the same or different species. In some cases, one species differed in its effect on another according to host origin.

    "abstract": "Together with increasing environmental and anthropogenic pressures, pathogenic diseases are one of important factors contributing to the ongoing decline of seagrass meadows worldwide; yet the diversity and ecology of the microorganisms acknowledged as seagrass parasites remain critically understudied. Here we investigate phytomyxid parasites (Rhizaria: Endomyxa: Phytomyxea) of three different eelgrass (Zostera spp.) species found in the Northern hemisphere. We present molecular evidence that Plasmodiophora bicaudata, a long-recognized parasite of dwarf eelgrass taxa, is closely related to the novel phytomyxid recently discovered in root hairs of Zostera marina, and together they form a distinct clade within the order Phagomyxida, proposed here as Feldmanniella gen. nov. A full life cycle is systematically described in a phagomyxid representative for the first time, proving its conformity with the generalized phytomyxid life history, despite previous uncertainties. The presence of primary infection stages in nearly all collected eelgrass specimens, and subsequent analysis of amplicon sequences from a global Z. marina dataset, reveal phytomyxids to be ubiquitous and one of the predominant microeukaryotes associated with eelgrass roots on a global scale. Our discoveries challenge the current view of Phytomyxea as rare entities in seagrass meadows and suggest their generally low pathogenicity in natural ecosystems.\n\nOriginality-Significance StatementThis study addresses a group of microbial parasites critically understudied in the marine environment. It presents complex evidence that Phytomyxea - obligate intracellular biotrophs previously considered to be rare entities in the oceans, are in fact ubiquitous endobionts of seagrasses of the genus Zostera - foundation species and important primary producers in coastal areas worldwide. Our work represents a significant contribution to the fields of aquatic microbiology and seagrass ecology and is seminal to understanding the biology of Phytomyxea outside of terrestrial ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "The metazoan-specific Integrator complex catalyzes 3 end processing of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) as well as premature transcription termination events that attenuate expression of many protein-coding genes. Integrator has RNA endonuclease and protein phosphatase activities, but it remains unclear if both are always required for complex function. Here, we show that IntS6 (Integrator subunit 6) over-expression is sufficient to block Integrator function at a subset of Drosophila protein-coding genes, while having no effect on snRNA processing or attenuation of other loci. Over-expressed IntS6 titrates protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) subunits from the rest of the Integrator complex and thus the only loci affected are those where the phosphatase module is necessary for Integrator function. IntS6 functions analogous to a PP2A regulatory B subunit as over-expression of canonical B subunits, which do not associate with Integrator, are also sufficient to inhibit Integrator function at select loci. Altogether, these results show that the phosphatase module is critical and limiting at only a subset of Integrator regulated genes and point to recruitment of PP2A via IntS6 as a tunable step that can be used to modulate transcription termination efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian SWI/SNF (mSWI/SNF) complexes are ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes that are critical for normal cellular functions and that are mis-regulated in [~]20% of human cancers. These enzymes exhibit significant diversity in the composition of individual enzyme complexes. mSWI/SNF enzymes are classified into three general sub-families based on the presence or absence of specific subunit proteins. The three sub-families are called BAF (BRM or BRG1-associated factors), ncBAF (non-canonical BAF), and PBAF (Polybromo-associated BAF). The biological roles for the different subfamilies of mSWI/SNF enzymes are poorly described. We knocked down (KD) the expression of genes encoding subunit proteins unique to each of the three subfamilies, Baf250A, Brd9, and Baf180, which mark the BAF, ncBAF, and PBAF sub-families, respectively, and examined the requirement for each in myoblast differentiation. We found that BAF250A and the BAF complex was required to drive lineage-specific gene expression during myoblast differentiation. KD of Baf250A reduced the expression of the lineage determinant Myogenin and other differentiation markers, due to decreased binding of BAF250A to myogenic gene promoters. KD of Brd9 delayed myoblast differentiation. However, RNA-seq analysis revealed that while the Baf250A-dependent gene expression profile included genes involved in myogenesis, the Brd9-dependent gene expression profile did not. Moreover, no-colocalization of Baf250A and Brd9 was observed in differentiating cells, suggesting independent mechanisms of action for BAF and ncBAF complexes in myogenesis. The PBAF complex was dispensable for myoblast differentiation. The results distinguish between the roles of the mSWI/SNF enzyme subfamilies during myoblast differentiation.",

How these activities are coordinated to prevent hypoglycemia and hepatosteatosis is not clear. Fructose-1,6 bisphosphatase (FBP1) is rate controlling for gluconeogenesis. However, inborn human FBP1 deficiency does not cause hypoglycemia unless accompanied by fasting or starvation, which also trigger paradoxical hepatomegaly, hepatosteatosis, and hyperlipidemia in affected individuals. Hepatocyte FBP1-ablated mice exhibit identical fasting-conditional pathologies along with AKT hyperactivation, whose inhibition reversed hepatomegaly, hepatosteatosis and hyperlipidemia but not hypoglycemia. Surprisingly, fasting-mediated AKT hyperactivation is insulin-dependent. FBP1 prevents insulin hyperresponsiveness, independently of its catalytic activity, by interacting with AKT, PP2A-C and Aldolase-B (ALDOB) to specifically accelerate AKT dephosphorylation. Enhanced by fasting and weakened by elevated insulin, FBP1:AKT:PP2A-C:ALDOB complex formation, which is disrupted by human FBP1 deficiency mutations or a C-terminal FBP1 truncation, prevents insulin-triggered liver pathologies and maintains lipid and glucose homeostasis. Conversely, a complex disrupting peptide reverses diet-induced insulin resistance.",

Transcription of the expanded repeats results in the formation of RNA-containing nuclear foci and altered RNA metabolism. In addition, repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation of the expanded GGGGCC-repeat sequence results in the production of highly toxic dipeptide-repeat (DPR) proteins. GGGGCC-repeat-containing transcripts form G-quadruplexes, which are associated with formation of RNA foci and RAN translation. Zfp106, an RNA-binding protein essential for motor neuron survival in mice, suppresses neurotoxicity in a Drosophila model of C9orf72 ALS via a previously unknown mechanism. Here, we show that Zfp106 inhibits formation of RNA foci and significantly reduces RAN translation caused by GGGGCC-repeats in mammalian cells. Further, we show that Zfp106 binds to RNA G-quadruplexes and causes a conformational change in the G-quadruplex structure formed by GGGGCC-repeats. These data suggest that Zfp106 suppresses GGGGCC repeat-mediated cytotoxicity through alteration of the repeats G-quadruplex structure.",

    "abstract": "E2 conjugating enzymes (E2s) play a central role in the enzymatic cascade that leads to the attachment of ubiquitin to a substrate. This process, termed ubiquitylation is fundamental for maintaining cellular homeostasis and impacts almost all cellular process. By interacting with multiple E3 ligases, E2s direct the ubiquitylation landscape within the cell. Since its discovery, ubiquitylation has been regarded as a post-translational modification that specifically targets lysine side chains (canonical ubiquitylation). We used MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry to discover and characterize a family of E2s that are instead able to conjugate ubiquitin to serine and/or threonine. We employed protein modelling and prediction tools to identify the catalytic determinants that these E2s use to interact with ubiquitin as well as their substrates. Our results join a stream of recent literature that challenges the definition of ubiquitylation as an exquisitely lysine-specific modification and provide crucial insights into the missing E2 element responsible for non-canonical ubiquitylation.\n\nTeaserE2 conjugating enzymes (E2s) play a fundamental role in the attachment of ubiquitin to its substrate. Most E2s can form an isopeptide bond between the ubiquitin C- terminus and a lysine present on the substrate. We identified a family of E2s, UBE2Q1 and UBE2Q2, able to target amino acids other than lysine. Currently nothing is known about their mechanism of action and what substrates they are targeting, even though genetic ablation of UBE2Q1 produce substantial infertility in mice. Here we answer the question about what the key residues beneath their peculiar activity are. We discovered that UBE2Q1 target the lysine-free cytoplasmic domain of the Golgi resident protein Beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 1, providing an interesting precedent for the role of non-canonical ubiquitylation in eukaryotic cells.",

    "abstract": "Cell polarity oscillations in Myxococcus xanthus motility are driven by a prokaryotic small Ras-like GTPase, MglA, which switches from one cell pole to the other in response to extracellular signals. MglA dynamics is regulated by MglB, which functions both as a GAP (GTPase activating protein) and a GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor) for MglA. With an aim to dissect the role of asymmetry in the dual GAP and GEF activities of MglB, we generated a functional MglAB complex by co-expressing MglB with a linked construct of MglA and MglB. This strategy enabled us to generate mutations of individual MglB protomers (MglB1 linked to MglA or MglB2) and delineate their role in GEF and GAP activities. We establish that the C-terminal helix of MglB1, but not MglB2, stimulates nucleotide exchange through a site away from the nucleotide-binding pocket, confirming an allosteric mechanism. Interaction between the N-terminal {beta}-strand of MglB1 and {beta}0 of MglA is essential for the GEF activity of MglB. Specific residues of MglB2 which interact with Switch-I of MglA partially contribute to its GAP activity. Thus, the role of the MglB2 protomer in the GAP activity of MglB is limited to restricting the conformation of MglA active site loops by steric hindrance. The direct demonstration of the allosteric mechanism of GEF action provides us new insights into the regulation of small Ras-like GTPases, a feature potentially present in many uncharacterized GEFs.",

    "abstract": "Chimeric small molecules that induce post-translational modification (PTM) on a target protein by bringing it in proximity to a PTM-inducing enzyme are furnishing novel modalities to perturb protein function. Despite recent advances, such molecules are unavailable for a critical PTM, tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, the contemporary design paradigm of chimeric molecules, formed by joining a non-inhibitory binder of the PTM-inducing enzyme with the binder of the target protein, prohibits the recruitment of most PTM-inducing enzymes as their non-inhibitory binders are unavailable. Here, we report two platforms to generate phosphorylation-inducing chimeric small molecules (PHICS) for tyrosine phosphorylation. We generate PHICS from both non-inhibitory binders (scantily available, platform 1) and kinase inhibitors (abundantly available, platform 2) using cysteine-based group transfer chemistry. PHICS triggered phosphorylation on tyrosine residues in diverse sequence contexts and target proteins (e.g., membrane-associated, cytosolic) and displayed multiple bioactivities, including initiation of a growth receptor signaling cascade and death of drug-resistant cancer cells. These studies provide an approach to induce biologically relevant PTM and lay the foundation for pharmacologic PTM editing (i.e., induction or removal) on target proteins using abundantly available inhibitors of PTM-inducing or erasing enzymes.\n\nTOC\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=105 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/531183v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cdf529org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19a70cdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@63dbf9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1febaaf_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The Intergenic Region Internal Ribosome Entry Sites (IGR IRESs) of Discistroviridae promote protein synthesis without initiation factors, with IRES translocation by elongation factor 2 (eEF2) being the first factor catalyzed reaction. Here, we developed a system that allows for the observation of intersubunit conformation of eukaryotic ribosomes at the single-molecule level. We use it to follow translation initiation and subsequent translocation of the cricket paralysis virus IRES (CrPV IRES). We observed that pre-translocation 80S-IRES ribosomes spontaneously exchanged between non-rotated and semi-rotated conformations but predominantly occupied a semi-rotated conformation. In the presence of eEF2, ribosomes underwent forward and reverse translocation. Both reactions were eEF2 concentration dependent, indicating that eEF2 promoted both forward and reverse translocation. The antifungal sordarin, stabilizes eEF2 on the ribosome after GTP hydrolysis in an extended conformation. 80S-CrPV IRES-eEF2-sordarin complexes underwent multiple rounds of forward and reverse translocations per eEF2 binding event. In the presence of sordarin, GTP hydrolysis or phosphate release were not required for IRES translocation. Together, these results suggest that in the presence of sordarin, eEF2 promotes the mid and late stages of CrPV IRES translocation by unlocking ribosomal movements, with mid and late stages of translocation being thermally driven.",

    "abstract": "Archaea play indispensable roles in global biogeochemical cycles, yet many critical cellular processes, including cell-shape determination, are poorly understood. Haloferax volcanii, a model haloarchaeon, forms rods and disks, depending on growth conditions. Here, we used a combination of iterative proteomics, genetics, and live-cell imaging to identify distinct mutants that only form rods or disks. We compared the proteomes of the mutants with wild-type cells across growth phases, thereby distinguishing between protein abundance changes specific to cell shape and those related to growth phases. The corresponding results indicated a diverse set of proteins, including transporters, transducers, signaling components, and transcriptional regulators, as important for cell-shape determination. We also identified structural proteins, including a previously unknown cytoskeletal element, the Hfx. volcanii actin homolog volactin, which plays a role in disk-shape morphogenesis. In summary, we gleaned important insights into archaeal cell-shape determination, with possible implications for understanding the evolution of cell morphology regulation across domains.",

    "abstract": "Summary ParagraphMammalian skin appendages, such as hair follicles and sweat glands, are complex mini-organs formed during skin development1, 2. As wounds heal, the resulting scar tissue lacks skin appendages. The clinical regeneration of skin appendages is an ongoing challenge3, 4. Skin epithelial tissues have been regenerated in vivo by cellular reprogramming5, 6, but the de novo generation of skin appendages has not previously been achieved. Here, we show that transplantation of a type of epithelial cell and two types of mesenchymal cells, reprogrammed from adult mouse subcutaneous mesenchymal cells to mimic developing skin cells, resulted in the generation of skin-appendage-like structures. Furthermore, with the development of a new AAV serotype, in vivo reprogramming of wound-resident cells with the same reprogramming factors generates skin with de novo appendages in adult mice. These findings may provide new therapeutic avenues for skin regeneration and frequent aging-associated skin appendage disorders, such as hair loss and dry skin, and may extend to other tissues and organs. This study also provides the potential for de novo generation of complex organs in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Landscape modification is a major threat to carnivores worldwide, but modified landscapes can also provide important habitat for these species, as protected areas alone are insufficient. Understanding how carnivores move through modified landscapes, such as production forests, can inform management strategies to improve the value of these landscapes to carnivores. Little is known about habitat selection by marsupial carnivores in production forests, where they occupy a similar ecological niche to their more well-studied eutherian counterparts. We used GPS tracking, Hidden Markov Models, and Manlys selection ratios to identify the habitat selected in 3 movement states indicating resting/feeding, foraging, and travel by the largest marsupial carnivore, the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii), in a timber plantation-dominated landscape. Devils did not show preferences for any of native forest, native grassland, and plantation in any movement state. Within plantations, devils preferred a plantation age of 4-7 years (selection ratio [wi] = 1.52) and slightly avoided older plantations (8-13 years wi = 0.74, 14+ years wi = 0.65). Devils preferred roads (state 1: wi = 2.71, state 2: wi = 2.48, state 3: wi = 2.97) and plantation edges (state 1: wi = 2.38, state 2: wi = 2.24, state 3: wi = 2.78) in all movement states, and moved faster on roads (0.06 [95% CI 0.04 to 0.09] m.sec-1) and edges (0.08 [0.06 to 0.10] m.sec-1) than away from them, indicating they use them for foraging and travel. No measured habitat variables influenced devil home range size. To support devils in plantation landscapes, we recommend maintaining a heterogeneous landscape of different plantation ages and native remnants and reducing the risk of vehicle collisions by minimizing forestry traffic at night. Tasmanian devils share similar adaptable traits to generalist eutherian carnivore species in their use of modified landscapes. Plantations can provide valuable habitat for this and other threatened predator species.",

    "abstract": "Symbiotic relationships drive evolutionary change and are important sources of novelty. Here we demonstrate a highly structured syntrophic symbiosis between species of the anaerobic protist Anaeramoeba (Anaeramoebae, Metamonada) and bacterial ectosymbionts. We dissected this symbiosis with long-read metagenomics, transcriptomics of host and symbiont cells coupled with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and microscopy. Genome sequencing, phylogenomic analyses and FISH show that the symbionts belong to the Desulfobacteraceae and were acquired independently in two different Anaeramoeba species. We show that ectosymbionts likely reside deep within cell surface invaginations in a symbiosomal membrane network that is tightly associated with cytoplasmic hydrogenosomes. Metabolic reconstructions based on the genomes and transcriptomes of the symbionts suggest a highly evolved syntrophic interaction. Host hydrogenosomes likely produce hydrogen, acetate, and propionate that are consumed by the symbionts dissimilatory sulfate reduction, Wood-Ljungdahl and methylmalonyl pathways, respectively. Because the host genome sequences encode several vitamin B12-dependent enzymes but appear to lack the ability to biosynthesize this vitamin, we hypothesize that the symbionts supply their hosts with B12. We detected numerous lateral gene transfers from diverse bacteria to Anaeramoeba, including genes involved in oxygen defense and anaerobic metabolism. Gene families encoding membrane-trafficking components that regulate the phagosomal maturation machinery are notably expanded in Anaeramoeba spp. and may be involved in organizing and/or stabilizing the symbiosomal membrane system. Overall, the Anaeramoebae have evolved a dynamic symbiosome comprised of a vacuolar system that facilitates positioning and maintenance of sulfate-reducing bacterial ectosymbionts.",

    "abstract": "Whole genome sequencing (WGS), despite its advantages, is yet to replace alternative methods for genotyping single nucleotide variants (SNVs). Structural variants (SVs) have larger effects on traits than SNVs, but are more challenging to accurately genotype. Using low-coverage WGS with genotype imputation offers a cost-effective strategy to achieve genome-wide variant coverage, but is yet to be tested for SVs. Here, we investigate combined SNV and SV imputation with low-coverage WGS data in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). As the reference panel, we used genotypes for high-confidence SVs and SNVs for n=445 wild individuals sampled from diverse populations. We also generated 15x WGS data (n=20 samples) for a commercial population out-with the reference panel, and called SVs and SNVs with gold-standard approaches. An imputation method (GLIMPSE) was tested at WGS depths of 1x, 2x, 3x and 4x for samples within and out-with the reference panel. SNVs were imputed with high accuracy and recall across all WGS depths, including for samples out-with the reference panel. For SVs, we compared imputation based purely on linkage disequilibrium (LD) with SNVs, to that supplemented with SV genotype likelihoods (GLs) from low-coverage WGS. Including SV GLs increased imputation accuracy, but as a trade-off with recall, requiring 3-4x coverage for best performance. Combining strategies allowed us to capture 84% of the reference panel deletions with 87% accuracy at 1x WGS. This study highlights the promise of reference panel imputation using low-coverage WGS, including novel opportunities to enhance the resolution of genome-wide association studies by capturing SVs.",

Landing sites for this approach are available on four chromosomes in several configurations which yield lines marked in distinct cell types. An array of vectors permit creating transgenes using a variety of selection methods (HygR, NeoR, PuroR, unc-119(+)) that yield lines expressing different colored FP tagged lines (BFP, GFP, mNG, and Scarlet). Although these transgenes retain a plasmid backbone and a selection marker, the inclusion of these sequences typically does not alter the expression of several cell specific promoters tested. However, in certain orientations promoters exhibits crosstalk with adjacent transcription units. In cases where crosstalk is problematic, the loxP-flanked fluorescent marker, plasmid backbone and hygR gene can be excised by crossing through germline Cre expressing lines also created using this technique. Finally, genetic and molecular reagents designed to facilitate customization of both targeting vectors and landing sites are also described. Together, the rRMCE toolbox provides a platform for developing further innovative uses of RMCE to create complex genetically engineered tools.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe regional heterogeneity of vascular components and transcriptomes is an important determinant of aortic biology. This notion has been explored in multiple mouse studies. In the present study, we examined the regional heterogeneity of aortas in non-human primates.\n\nMethodsAortic samples were harvested from the ascending, descending, suprarenal, and infrarenal regions of young control monkeys and adult monkeys provided with high fructose for 3 years. The regional heterogeneity of aortic structure and transcriptomes was examined by histological and bulk RNA sequencing analyses.\n\nResultsImmunostaining of CD31 and SMA revealed that endothelial and smooth muscle cells were distributed homogeneously across the aortic regions. In contrast, elastic fibers were less abundant and dispersed in the infrarenal aorta compared to other regions and associated with collagen deposition. Bulk RNA sequencing identified a distinct transcriptome related to the Notch signaling pathway in the infrarenal aorta with significantly increased NOTCH3 mRNA compared to other regions. Immunostaining revealed that NOTCH3 protein was increased in the media of the infrarenal aorta. The abundance of medial NOTCH3 was positively correlated with the dispersion of elastic fibers. Adult cynomolgus monkeys provided with high fructose displayed vascular wall remodeling, such as smooth muscle cell loss and elastic fiber disruption, predominantly in the infrarenal region. The correlation between NOTCH3 and elastic fiber dispersion was enhanced in these monkeys.\n\nConclusionsAortas of young cynomolgus monkeys display regional heterogeneity of their transcriptome and the structure of elastin and collagens. Elastic fibers in the infrarenal aorta are dispersed along with upregulation of medial NOTCH3.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS- The present study determined the regional heterogeneity of aortas from cynomolgus monkeys.\n- Aortas of young cynomolgus monkeys displayed region-specific aortic structure and transcriptomes.\n- Elastic fibers were dispersed in the infrarenal aorta along with increased NOTCH3 abundance in the media.\n\n\nGRAPHIC ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=113 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/530901v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (36K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@aeb42dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b71059org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1927a4eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19bb77d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

ATP1A1 variants that cause CMT induce loss-of-function of NKA. This heterodimeric ({beta}) enzyme hydrolyzes ATP to establish transmembrane electrochemical gradients of Na+ and K+ that are essential for electrical signaling and cell survival. Of the 4 catalytic subunit isoforms, 1 is ubiquitously expressed and is the predominant paralog in peripheral axons. Human population sequencing datasets indicate strong negative selection against both missense and protein-null ATP1A1 variants. To test whether haploinsufficiency generated by heterozygous protein-null alleles are sufficient to cause disease, we tested the neuromuscular characteristics of heterozygous Atp1a1+/- knockout mice and their wildtype littermates, while also evaluating if exercise increased CMT penetrance. We found that Atp1a1+/- mice were phenotypically normal up to 18 months of age. Consistent with the observations in mice, we report clinical phenotyping of a healthy adult human who lacks any clinical features of known ATP1A1-related diseases despite carrying a protein-null early truncation variant, p.Y148*. Taken together, these results suggest that a malfunctioning gene product is required for disease induction by ATP1A1 variants and that if any pathology is associated with protein-null variants, they may display low penetrance or high age of onset.",

    "abstract": "Cu+-chaperones are a diverse group of proteins that allocate Cu+ ions to specific copper-proteins, creating different copper pools targeted to specific physiological processes. Symbiotic nitrogen fixation carried out in legume root nodules indirectly requires relatively large amounts of copper e.g. for energy delivery via respiration, for which targeted copper deliver systems would be required. MtNCC1 is a nodule-specific Cu+-chaperone encoded in the Medicago truncatula genome, with a N-terminus Atx1-like domain that can bind Cu+ with picomolar affinities. This gene is expressed primarily from the late infection zone to the early fixation zone, and is located in the cytosol, associated to plasma and symbiosome membranes, and within nuclei. Consistent with its key role in nitrogen fixation, ncc1 mutants have a severe reduction of nitrogenase activity, and a 50% reduction in copper-dependent cytochrome c oxidase activity. A subset of the copper-proteome is also affected in the mutant nodules. Many of these proteins can be pulled-down when using a Cu+-loaded N-terminal MtNCC1 moiety as a bait, indicating a role in nodule copper homeostasis and in copper-dependent physiological processes. Overall, these data suggest a pleiotropic role of MtNCC1 in copper delivery for symbiotic nitrogen fixation.",

Results show that a second HS induces changes in coding and noncoding RNA expression and alternative splicing and that DNA demethylation is responsible for mediating differential gene expression. We identified a long noncoding RNA regulatory network and provided evidence that lncRNAs positively regulate gene expression, while miRNAs are implicated in alternative splicing events. We reconstructed the ancestral heat memory network of flowering plants by comparing the dynamic responses of Arabidopsis thaliana and Brachypodium distachyon.

    "abstract": "There have recently been rapid advances in deep learning models for protein design. To demonstrate proof-of-concept, these advancements have focused on small proteins with lots of data for training. This means that they are often not suitable for generating proteins with the most potential for high clinical impact -due to the additional challenges of sparse data and large size many therapeutically relevant proteins have. One major application that fits this category is gene therapy delivery. Viral vectors such as Adenoviruses and AAVs are a common delivery vehicle for gene therapy. However, environmental exposure means that most people exhibit potent pre-existing immune responses to many serotypes. This response, primarily driven by neutralizing antibodies, also precludes repeated administration with the same serotype. Rare serotypes, serotypes targeting other species, and capsid engineering, have all been deployed in the service of reducing neutralization by pre-existing antibodies. However, progress has been very limited using conventional methods and a new approach is urgently needed. To address this, we developed a variational autoencoder that can generate synthetic viral vector serotypes without epitopes for pre-existing neutralizing antibodies. A compact generative computational model was constructed, with only 12.4 million parameters that could be efficiently trained on the limited natural sequences (e.g., 711 natural Adenovirus hexon sequences with average length of 938 amino acids). In contrast to the current state-of-the-art, the model was able to generate high-quality Adenovirus hexon sequences that were folded with high confidence by Alphafold2 to produce structures essentially identical to natural hexon structures. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed that the structures are stable and protein-protein interfaces are intact. Local secondary structure and local mobility is also comparable with natural serotype behavior. Our model could be used to generate a broad range of synthetic adenovirus serotype sequences without epitopes for pre-existing neutralizing antibodies in the human population. It could be used more broadly to generate different types of viral vector, and any large, therapeutically valuable proteins, where available data is sparse.",

    "abstract": "Worldwide, fetal growth restriction (FGR) affects 7 to 10% of pregnancies, or roughly 20.5 million infants, each year. FGR not only increases neonatal mortality and morbidity but also the risk of obesity in later life. Currently, the molecular mechanisms by which FGR \"programs\" an obese phenotype are not well understood. Studies demonstrate that FGR females are more prone to obesity compared to males; however, the molecular mechanisms that lead to the sexually dimorphic programming of FGR are not known. Thus, we hypothesized that FGR leads to the sexually dimorphic programming of preadipocytes and reduces their ability to differentiate into mature adipocytes. To test the hypothesis, we utilized a maternal hyperthermia-induced placental insufficiency to restrict fetal growth in sheep. We collected perirenal adipose tissue from male and female near-term FGR and normal-weight fetal lambs (N=4 in each group, 16 total), examined the preadipocytes differentiation potential, and identified differential mRNA transcript expression in perirenal adipose tissue. Male FGR fetuses have lower cellular density compared to control male fetuses. However, no difference was observed in female FGR fetuses compared to control female fetuses. In addition, the ability of preadipocytes to differentiate into mature adipocytes with fat accumulation was impaired in male FGR fetuses, but this was not observed in female FGR fetuses. Finally, we examined the genes and pathways involved in the sexually dimorphic programming of obesity by FGR. On enrichment of differentially expressed genes in males compared to females, the Thermogenesis KEGG Pathway was downregulated, and the Metabolic and Steroid Biosynthesis KEGG pathways were upregulated. On enrichment of differentially expressed genes in male FGR compared to male control, the Steroid Biosynthesis KEGG Pathway was downregulated, and the PPAR Signaling KEGG pathway was upregulated. No pathways were altered in females in response to growth restriction in perirenal adipose tissue. Thus, the present study demonstrates a sexually dimorphic program in response to growth restriction in sheep fetal perirenal adipose tissue.",

    "abstract": "Individuals often assess past decisions by comparing what was gained with what would have been gained had they acted differently. Thoughts of past alternatives that counter what actually happened are called \"counterfactuals\". Recent theories emphasize the role of the prefrontal cortex in processing counterfactual outcomes in decision-making, although how subcortical regions contribute to this process remains to be elucidated. Here we report a clear distinction among the roles of the orbitofrontal cortex, ventral striatum and midbrain dopamine neurons in processing counterfactual outcomes in monkeys. Our findings suggest that actually-gained and counterfactual outcome signals are both processed in the cortico-subcortical network constituted by these regions but in distinct manners, and integrated only in the orbitofrontal cortex in a way to compare these outcomes. This study extends the prefrontal theory of counterfactual thinking and provides key insights regarding how the prefrontal cortex cooperates with subcortical regions to make decisions using counterfactual information.\n\nTeaserCortical and subcortical systems both contribute to counterfactual thinking of decision outcomes but in distinct manners.",

    "abstract": "Studying and understanding the code of large neural populations hinge on learning accurate statistical models of population activity. A new class of such models, based on learning to weigh sparse nonlinear Random Projections (RP) of the population, was recently shown to be highly accurate, efficient, and scalable. Moreover, RP models have a clear biologically-plausible implementation as a shallow neural circuit. Here we extend these models and present RP models that are learned by optimizing the randomly selected sparse projections. This \"reshaping\" of projections is akin to changing synaptic connections in the corresponding neural circuit model. When we applied these Reshaped RP models to recordings of tens of cortical neurons from behaving monkeys, we found them to be more accurate and efficient than the previous class of RP models and on par with backpropagation models. Our exploration of the effect of adding biological features to these circuit models revealed that learning reshaped RP models with homeostatic synaptic scaling yields even more efficient and accurate models. We further show that homeostatic reshaped RP models, which rely on sparse and random connectivity, are superior to fully connected network models. Our results thus suggest a key functional role for homeostatic scaling in neural circuits, beyond regulating network activity, namely - optimizing performance and efficiency.",

    "abstract": "The ability of monkeys and rats to carry out spatial working memory tasks has been shown to depend on the persistent firing of pyramidal cells in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), arising from recurrent excitatory connections on dendritic spines. These spines express hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels whose open state is increased by cAMP signaling, and which markedly alter PFC network connectivity and neuronal firing. In traditional neural circuits, activation of these non-selective cation channels leads to neuronal depolarization and increased firing rate. Paradoxically, cAMP activation of HCN channels in PFC pyramidal cells reduces working memory-related neuronal firing. This suggests that activation of HCN channels may hyperpolarize rather than depolarize these neurons. The current study tested the hypothesis that Na+ influx through HCN channels activates Na+-activated K+ (KNa or Slack) channels to hyperpolarize the membrane. We have found that HCN and Slack KNa channels co-immunoprecipitate in cortical extracts and that, by immunoelectron microscopy, they colocalize at postsynaptic spines of PFC pyramidal neurons. A specific blocker of HCN channels, ZD7288, reduces KNa current in pyramidal cells that express both HCN and Slack channels, indicating that blockade of HCN channels reduced K+ current indirectly by lowering Na+ influx. In contrast, ZD7288 has no effect on KNa currents in an HEK cell line stably expressing this Slack channels but no HCN channels, demonstrating that ZD7288 does not block Slack channels directly. Activation of HCN channels by cAMP in a cell line expressing a Ca2+ reporter results in elevation of cytoplasmic Ca2+, but the effect of cAMP is completely reversed if the HCN channels are co-expressed with Slack channels. Finally, we have used a novel pharmacological blocker of Slack channels to show that inhibition of either Slack or HCN channels in rat PFC improves working memory performance, and that the actions of Slack and HCN channel blockers occlude each other in the memory task. Our results suggest that the regulation of working memory by HCN channels in PFC pyramidal neurons is mediated by an HCN-Slack channel complex that links activation HCN channels to suppression of neuronal excitability.",

    "abstract": "Genetic studies place Tbx5 at the apex of the sinoatrial node (SAN) transcriptional program. To understand its role in SAN differentiation, clonal embryonic stem (ES) cell lines were made that conditionally overexpress Tbx5, Tbx3, Tbx18, Shox2, Islet-1 and Map3k7/TAK1. and cardiac cells differentiated using embryoid bodies (EBs). EBs overexpressing Tbx5, Islet1, and TAK1 beat faster than cardiac cells differentiated from control ES cell lines suggesting possible roles in SAN differentiation. Tbx5 overexpressing EBs showed increased expression of TAK1, but cardiomyocytes did not differentiate as SAN cells. They showed no increase in the expression of Shox2, or Islet1 and decreased expression of HCN4. EBs constitutively overexpressing TAK1 direct cardiac differentiation to the SAN fate, but also have decreased phosphorylation of its targets, p38, and Jnk. This opens the possibility that blocking the phosphorylation of TAK1 targets may have the same impact as forced overexpression. To test this, we treated EBs with 5z-7-Oxozeanol (OXO), an inhibitor of TAK1 phosphorylation. Like TAK1 overexpressing cardiac cells, cardiomyocytes differentiated in the presence of OXO beat faster and showed increased expression of SAN genes (Shox2, HCN4, and Islet1). This suggests that activation of the SAN transcriptional network can be accomplished by blocking the phosphorylation of TAK1.",
