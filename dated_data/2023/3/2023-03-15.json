    "abstract": "Control of brain energy metabolism and regulation of synaptic activity through gliotransmission are two important ways, through which astrocytes contribute to mental functions. However, the potential functional and molecular links between these two astrocyte-dependent processes have been scantly explored so far. Here we show that a lactate-dependent shift of glycolysis underlies the production of the gliotransmitter D-serine by acute activation of astrocyte type-1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptors, thereby gating synaptic and cognitive processes. Acute cannabinoid application causes a CB1 receptor-dependent rapid and reversible increase of lactate production and release in primary astrocyte cultures. As shown before, mutant mice lacking the CB1 receptor gene in astrocytes (GFAP-CB1-KO) were impaired in a novel object recognition (NOR) task. Notably, this phenotype was rescued not only by the gliotransmitter D-serine, but also by its precursor L-serine. Surprisingly, the administration of lactate also reverted the memory impairment of GFAP-CB1-KO mice. This rescue effect was abolished by in vivo blockade of the astrocyte-specific phosphorylated pathway (PP), which diverts glycolysis towards L-serine synthesis, suggesting that lactate itself might promote the accumulation of this amino acid. Consistent with this idea, lactate increased the co-agonist occupancy of CA1 post-synaptic hippocampal NMDA receptors in a PP-dependent manner. By establishing a mechanistic link between lactate, serine availability, synaptic activity and behavior, these results reveal an unforeseen functional connection between energy metabolism and gliotransmission to control cognitive processes.",

    "abstract": "Fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP) is an RNA-binding protein that can form granules within neurons. Although FMRP-containing Fragile X granules have been extensively characterized, visualizing changes in granule structure in relation to function has been difficult. We used high-resolution imaging to detect discrete differences in puncta size, intensity, and contrast in our mouse FMRP and serine 499 (S499) phospho-mutant reporters. Tracking analyses of FMRP particles showed that phospho-mutant granules traveled at rates consistent with active transport within dendrites. In addition, GFP-FMRP exhibited a wide range of speeds owing to its ability to oligomerize when overexpressed. Recent work suggested that FMRP granules could be phase separated structures that may function as hubs for local protein synthesis. To test this idea, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) on individual FMRP granules. Intriguingly, we observed only a partial recovery that occurred over minutes and was dependent on translation. Moreover, the phospho-mutants displayed differences in recovery kinetics reflecting the labile (S499A) or preferential (S499D) nature of their interaction with granules containing stalled ribosomes. Our high-resolution approach reveals that the phosphorylation-state of FMRP can modulate the clustering of FMRP granules and thereby regulate local protein synthesis at the level of individual granules.",

    "abstract": "Despite relatively accurate time judgment, subjective time is susceptible to various contexts, such as sample spacing and frequency. Several electroencephalographic (EEG) components have been linked to timing, including the contingent negative variation (CNV), offset P2, and late positive component of timing (LPCt). However, the specific role of these components in the contextual modulation of perceived time remains unclear. In this study, we conducted two temporal bisection experiments, where participants had to judge if a test duration was close to a short or long standard. Unbeknownst to participants, the sample spacing (Experiment 1) and frequency (Experiment 2) were altered to create short and long contexts while keeping the test range and standards the same in different sessions. The results showed that the bisection threshold shifted toward the ensemble mean and that CNV and LPCt were sensitive to context modulation. Compared to the long context, the CNV climbing rate increased in the short context, and the amplitude and latency of the LPCt were reduced. These findings suggest the CNV represents an expectancy wave for upcoming decision-making, while LPCt reflects the decision-making process, both influenced by the temporal context.",

    "abstract": "The induction of large-scale plasticity in the adult brain should be key for recovery from severe damage of the central nervous system. Here, drastic motor recovery was observed after subhemisection spinal cord injury in macaques that received intensive training and cortical electrical stimulation. During recovery, movement-related activity increased in ipsilesional sensorimotor areas and functional connectivity from ipsilesional to contralesional areas was strengthened. Electrical stimulation applied widely across bilateral sensorimotor areas induced muscle twitches in affected and intact forelimbs. The interhemispheric inhibition observed before injury was switched to facilitation. Furthermore, massive re-routing occurred in corticospinal axons from the contralesional motor cortex. Such global disinhibition and massive plasticity would open the workspace for the reorganization of motor networks to recruit novel areas for recovery.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryGlobal disinhibition and corticospinal plasticity for drastic recovery after spinal cord injury in macaque monkeys.",

    "abstract": "Arm movements in our daily lives have to be adjusted for several factors in response to the demands of the environment, for example, speed, direction or distance. Previously, we had shown that arm movement kinematics is optimally tuned to take advantage of gravity effects and minimize muscle effort in various pointing directions and gravity contexts (Gaveau et al., 2016). Here we build upon these results and focus on muscular adjustments. We used Machine Learning to analyze the ensemble activities of multiple muscles recorded during pointing in various directions. The advantage of such a technique would be the observation of patterns in collective muscular activity that may not be noticed using univariate statistics. By providing an index of multimuscle activity, the Machine Learning analysis brought to light several features of tuning for pointing direction. In attempting to trace tuning curves, all comparisons were done with respects to pointing in the horizontal, gravity free plane. We demonstrated that tuning for direction does not take place in a uniform fashion but in a modular manner in which some muscle groups play a primary role. The antigravity muscles were more finely tuned to pointing direction than the gravity muscles. Of note, was their tuning during the first half of downward pointing. As the antigravity muscles were deactivated during this phase, it supported the idea that deactivation is not an on-off function but is tuned to pointing direction. Further support for the tuning of the portions of the phasic EMG containing only negative activity was provided by progressively improving classification accuracies with increasing angular distance from the horizontal. Overall, these results show that the motor system tunes muscle commands to exploit gravity effects and reduce muscular effort. It quantitatively demonstrates that phasic EMG negativity is an essential feature of muscle control.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) regulate eukaryotic transcription through selecting DNA-binding, can also specifically interact with RNA, which may present another layer of transcriptional control. The mechanisms of the TFs-DNA recognition are often well-characterised, while the details of TFs-RNA complexation are less understood. Here we investigate the dual recognition mechanism of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which interacts with similar affinities with consensus DNA and diverse RNA hairpin motifs but discriminates against uniform dsRNA. Using atomic molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the GR binding to nucleic acids requires a wide and shallow groove pocket. The protein effectively moulds its binding site within DNA major groove, which enables base-specific interactions. Contrary, the GR binding has little effect on the grooves geometry of RNA systems, most notably in uniform dsRNA. Instead, a hairpin motif in RNA yields a wide and shallow major groove pocket, allowing the protein to anchor itself through nonspecific electrostatic contacts with RNA backbone. Addition of a bulge increases RNA hairpin flexibility, which leads to a greater number of GR-RNA contacts and, thus, higher affinity. Thus, the combination of structural motifs defines the GR-RNA selective binding: a recognition mechanism, which may be shared by other zinc finger TFs",

    "abstract": "Crop engineering and de novo domestication using genome editing are new frontiers in agriculture. However, outside of well-studied crops and model systems, prioritizing engineering targets remains challenging. Evolution can serve as our guide, revealing high-priority genes with deeply conserved roles. Indeed, GRASSY TILLERS1 (GT1), SIX-ROWED SPIKE1 (VRS1), and their homologs have repeatedly been targets of selection in domestication and evolution. This repeated selection may be because these genes have an ancient, conserved role in regulating growth repression. To test this, we determined the roles of GT1 and VRS1 homologs in maize (Zea mays) and the distantly related grass brachypodium (Brachypodium distachyon) using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing and mutant analysis. GT1 and VRS1 have roles in floral development in maize and barley, respectively. Grass flowers are borne in branching structures called spikelets. In maize spikelets, carpels are suppressed in half of all initiated ear flowers. These spikelets can only produce single grains. We show that gt1; vrs1-like1 (vrl1) mutants have derepressed carpels in ear flowers. Importantly, these plants can produce two grains per spikelet. In brachypodium, bdgt1; bdvrl1 mutants have more branches, spikelets, and flowers than wildtype plants, indicating conserved roles for GT1 and VRS1 homologs in growth suppression. Indeed, maize GT1 can suppress growth in Arabidopsis thaliana, separated from the grasses by ca. 160 million years of evolution. Thus, GT1 and VRS1 maintain their potency as growth regulators across vast timescales and in distinct developmental contexts. Modulating the activity of these and other conserved genes may be critical in crop engineering.",

    "abstract": "Malaria remains a devastating disease and, with current measures failing to control its transmission, there is a need for novel interventions. A family of proteins that have long been pursued as potential intervention targets are aquaporins which are channels facilitating the movement of water and other solutes across membranes. We identify a new aquaporin in malaria parasites and demonstrate that it is essential for disease transmission through mosquitoes. Disruption of AQP2 in the human parasite Plasmodium falciparum and the rodent parasite Plasmodium berghei blocks sporozoite production inside oocysts established on mosquito midguts, preventing parasite infection of salivary glands and transmission to a new host. In vivo epitope tagging of AQP2 in P. berghei, combined with immunofluorescence assays, reveals that the protein is localized in previously uncharacterized organelles found in the cytoplasm of gametocytes, ookinetes and sporozoites. The number of these organelles varies between individual parasites and lifecycle stages suggesting that they are likely part of a dynamic endolysosomal system. Phylogenetic analysis confirms that AQP2 is unique to malaria and closely related parasites and most closely related to other intracellular aquaporins. Structure prediction analyses identify several unusual features, including a large accessory extracellular loop and an arginine-to-phenylalanine substitution in the selectivity filter principally determining pore function, a unique feature not found in any aquaporins studied to date. This in conjunction with the requirement of AQP2 for malaria transmission suggests that AQP2 may be a fruitful new target of novel antimalarial interventions.",

P. aeruginosa with lasR mutations were observed among keratitis isolates from a study collecting samples from India, so an isogenic lasR mutant strain of P. aeruginosa was included.\n\nMethodsRabbit corneas were intracorneally infected with P. aeruginosa strain PA14 or an isogenic {Delta}lasR mutant and co-injected with PBS or B. bacteriovorus. After 24 h, eyes were evaluated for clinical signs of infection. Samples were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, optical coherence tomography, sectioned for histology, and corneas were homogenized for CFU enumeration and for inflammatory cytokines.\n\nResultsWe observed that 54% of corneas infected by wild-type PA14 presented with a corneal perforation (n=24), whereas only 4% of PA14 infected corneas that were co-infected with B. bacteriovorus perforate (n=25). Wild-type P. aeruginosa proliferation was reduced 7-fold in the predatory bacteria treated eyes. The {Delta}lasR mutant was less able to proliferate compared to the wild-type, but was largely unaffected by B. bacteriovorus.\n\nConclusionThese studies indicate a role for bacterial quorum sensing in the ability of P. aeruginosa to proliferate and cause perforation of the rabbit cornea.

Previous animal studies showed that circulation complement C3 was deposited in the ischemic myocardium flooded with oxygenated blood upon reperfusion. Recently, we reported that myocardial necrosis was decreased in C3-/- mice after heart I/R. The current study used in the same heart model to test the effect of C3 on myocardial apoptosis. Our results showed that myocardial apoptosis was increased in C3-/- mice after heart I/R. Further, comparative proteomics analyses found that cytochrome c was present in the myocardial C3-complex following I/R. These results indicate that C3 can interact with cytochrome c in the cytosol of cardiomyocytes during myocardial I/R, which may sequester cytochrome c and thus reduce the number of cells undergoing apoptosis. In summary, our findings raise the possibility of a new mechanism affecting cell death relevant to pathologic conditions such as ischemia: a circulating innate immune factor, i.e. complement, can interact with intracellular factor(s), and influence the types of cell death that occur.",

How such diverse phenotypes are driven by pathogenic VCP variants is not known. We found that these diseases exhibit a common pathologic feature, ubiquitinated intranuclear inclusions affecting myocytes, osteoclasts and neurons. Moreover, knock-in cell lines harboring MSP variants show a reduction in nuclear VCP. Given that MSP is associated with neuronal intranuclear inclusions comprised of TDP-43 protein, we developed a cellular model whereby proteostatic stress results in the formation of insoluble intranuclear TDP-43 aggregates. Consistent with a loss of nuclear VCP function, cells harboring MSP variants or cells treated with VCP inhibitor exhibited decreased clearance of insoluble intranuclear TDP-43 aggregates. Moreover, we identified four novel compounds that activate VCP primarily by increasing D2 ATPase activity whereby pharmacologic VCP activation appears to enhance clearance of insoluble intranuclear TDP-43 aggregate. Our findings suggest that VCP function is important for nuclear protein homeostasis, that MSP may be the result of impaired nuclear proteostasis, and that VCP activation may be potential therapeutic by virtue of enhancing the clearance of intranuclear protein aggregates.",

    "abstract": "The master tumor suppressor p53 regulates multiple cell fate decisions, like cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, via transcriptional control of a broad gene network. Dysfunction in the p53 network is common in cancer, often through mutations that inactivate p53 or other members of the pathway. Induction of tumor-specific cell death by restoration of p53 activity without off-target effects has gained significant interest in the field. In this study, we explore the gene regulatory mechanisms underlying a putative anti-cancer strategy involving stimulation of the p53-independent Integrated Stress Response (ISR). Our data demonstrate the p53 and ISR pathways converge to independently regulate common metabolic and pro-apoptotic genes. We investigated the architecture of multiple gene regulatory elements bound by p53 and the ISR effector ATF4 controlling this shared regulation. We identified additional key transcription factors that control basal and stress-induced regulation of these shared p53 and ATF4 target genes. Thus, our results provide significant new molecular and genetic insight into gene regulatory networks and transcription factors that are the target of numerous antitumor therapies.",

    "abstract": "The small and large intestines arise from a common primordial gut tube but ultimately become specialized in both form and function. While the midgut forms villi, the hindgut develops flat, brain-like sulci that resolve into heterogeneous outgrowths. Gut compartment identities are demarcated early in development via Hox genes, which are highly conserved, master regulators of spatial patterning in the embryo. Yet, how these factors trigger regional morphogenesis has remained a mystery. Combining mechanical measurements and mathematical modeling, we demonstrate that the posterior Hox gene Hoxd13 regulates biophysical phenomena that shape the hindgut lumen. We further show that Hoxd13 acts through the TGF{beta} pathway to thicken, stiffen, and promote isotropic growth of the subepithelial mesenchyme; together, these features generate hindgut surface patterns. TGF{beta}, in turn, promotes collagen deposition to affect mesenchymal geometry and growth. We thus identify a cascade of events downstream of genetic identity that direct posterior intestinal morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Klunk et al. analyzed ancient DNA data from individuals in London and Denmark before, during and after the Black Death [1], and argued that allele frequency changes at immune genes were too large to be produced by random genetic drift and thus must reflect natural selection. They also identified four specific variants that they claimed show evidence of selection including at ERAP2, for which they estimate a selection coefficient of 0.39-several times larger than any selection coefficient on a common human variant reported to date. Here we show that these claims are unsupported for four reasons. First, the signal of enrichment of large allele frequency changes in immune genes comparing people in London before and after the Black Death disappears after an appropriate randomization test is carried out: the P value increases by ten orders of magnitude and is no longer significant. Second, a technical error in the estimation of allele frequencies means that none of the four originally reported loci actually pass the filtering thresholds. Third, the filtering thresholds do not adequately correct for multiple testing. Finally, in the case of the ERAP2 variant rs2549794, which Klunk et al. show experimentally may be associated with a host interaction with Y. pestis, we find no evidence of significant frequency change either in the data that Klunk et al. report, or in published data spanning 2,000 years. While it remains plausible that immune genes were subject to natural selection during the Black Death, the magnitude of this selection and which specific genes may have been affected remains unknown.",

    "abstract": "Inosine 5 monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) is a critical regulatory enzyme in purine nucleotide biosynthesis that is inhibited by the downstream product GTP. Multiple point mutations in the human isoform IMPDH2 have recently been associated with dystonia and other neurodevelopmental disorders, but the effect of the mutations on enzyme function has not been described. Here, we report identification of two additional affected individuals with missense variants in IMPDH2 and show that all of the disease-associated mutations disrupt GTP regulation. Cryo-EM structures of one IMPDH2 mutant suggest this regulatory defect arises from a shift in the conformational equilibrium toward a more active state. This structural and functional analysis provides insight into IMPDH2-associated disease mechanisms that point to potential therapeutic approaches and raises new questions about fundamental aspects of IMPDH regulation.\n\nSignificance StatementPoint mutations in the human enzyme IMPDH2, a critical regulator of nucleotide biosynthesis, are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, such as dystonia. Here, we report two additional IMPDH2 point mutants associated with similar disorders. We investigate the effects of each mutation on IMPDH2 structure and function in vitro and find that all mutations are gain of function, preventing allosteric regulation of IMPDH2 activity. We report high resolution structures of one variant and present a structure-based hypothesis for its dysregulation. This work provides a biochemical basis for understanding diseases caused by IMPDH2 mutation and lays a foundation for future therapeutic development.",

    "abstract": "Growth of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in zinc (Zn) limited medium leads to disruption of copper (Cu) homeostasis, resulting in up to 40-fold Cu over-accumulation relative to its typical Cu quota. We show that Chlamydomonas controls its Cu quota by balancing Cu import and export, which is disrupted in a Zn deficient cell, thus establishing a mechanistic connection between Cu and Zn homeostasis. Transcriptomics, proteomics and elemental profiling revealed that Zn-limited Chlamydomonas cells up-regulate a subset of genes encoding \"first responder\" proteins involved in sulfur (S) assimilation and consequently accumulate more intracellular S, which is incorporated into L-cysteine, {gamma}-glutamylcysteine and homocysteine. Most prominently, in the absence of Zn, free L-cysteine is increased ~80-fold, corresponding to ~ 2.8 x 109 molecules/cell. Interestingly, classic S-containing metal binding ligands like glutathione and phytochelatins do not increase. X-ray fluorescence microscopy showed foci of S accumulation in Zn-limited cells that co-localize with Cu, phosphorus and calcium, consistent with Cu-thiol complexes in the acidocalcisome, the site of Cu(I) accumulation. Notably, cells that have been previously starved for Cu do not accumulate S or Cys, causally connecting cysteine synthesis with Cu accumulation. We suggest that cysteine is an in vivo Cu(I) ligand, perhaps ancestral, that buffers cytosolic Cu.",

Although HTLV-1-induced diseases are well characterized and linked to the encoded Tax-1 oncoprotein, there is currently no strategy to target Tax-1 functions with small molecules. Here, we analysed the binding of Tax-1 to the human homolog of the drosophila discs large tumor suppressor (hDLG1/SAP97), a multi-domain scaffolding protein involved in Tax-1-transformation ability. We have solved the structures of the PDZ binding motif (PBM) of Tax-1 in complex with the PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains of hDLG1 and assessed the binding of 10 million molecules by virtual screening. Among the 19 experimentally confirmed compounds, one systematically inhibited the Tax-1-hDLG1 interaction in different biophysical and cellular assays, as well as HTLV-1 cell-to-cell transmission in a T-cell model. Thus, our work demonstrates that interactions involving Tax-1 PDZ-domains are amenable to small-molecule inhibition, which provides a framework for the design of targeted therapies for HTLV-1-induced diseases.",

    "abstract": "Crosstalk between ion channels and small GTPases is critical during homeostasis and disease1, but little is known about the structural underpinnings of these interactions. TRPV4 is a polymodal, calcium-permeable cation channel that has emerged as a potential therapeutic target in multiple conditions2-5. Gain-of-function mutations also cause hereditary neuromuscular disease6-11. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of human TRPV4 in complex with RhoA in the apo, antagonist-bound closed, and agonist-bound open states. These structures reveal the mechanism of ligand-dependent TRPV4 gating. Channel activation is associated with rigid-body rotation of the intracellular ankyrin repeat domain, but state-dependent interaction with membrane-anchored RhoA constrains this movement. Notably, many residues at the TRPV4-RhoA interface are mutated in disease and perturbing this interface by introducing mutations into either TRPV4 or RhoA increases TRPV4 channel activity. Together, these results suggest that the interaction strength between TRPV4 and RhoA tunes TRPV4-mediated calcium homeostasis and actin remodeling, and that disruption of TRPV4-RhoA interactions leads to TRPV4-related neuromuscular disease, findings that will guide TRPV4 therapeutics development.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental challenge of metabolic engineering involves assembling and screening vast combinations of orthologous enzymes across a multi-step biochemical pathway. Current pathway assembly workflows involve combining genetic parts ex vivo and assembling one pathway configuration per tube or well. Here we present CRAPS, Chromosomal-Repair-Assisted Pathway Shuffling, an in vivo pathway engineering technique that enables the self-assembly of one pathway configuration per cell. CRAPS leverages the yeast chromosomal repair pathway and utilizes a pool of inactive, chromosomally integrated orthologous gene variants corresponding to a target multi-step pathway. Supplying gRNAs to the CRAPS host activates the expression of one gene variant per pathway step, resulting in a unique pathway configuration in each cell. We deployed CRAPS to build more than 1,000 combinations of a four-step carotenoid biosynthesis network. Sampling the CRAPS pathway space yielded strains with distinct color phenotypes and carotenoid product profiles. We anticipate that CRAPS will expedite strain engineering campaigns by enabling the generation and sampling of vast biochemical spaces.",

The effector protein of retron 78, ptuAB, specifically degraded tRNATyr leading abortive infection, but phage countervailed this defense by supplying tRNATyr. Rad inhibited retron function by degrading noncoding RNA, the precursor of msDNA. In summary, we demonstrated that viruses encode at least two independent strategies for overcoming bacterial defense systems: anti-defense, such as Rad, and defense canceler, like tRNA.",

Toxicity and efficacy in vivo assays were conducted on Galleria mellonella larvae.\n\nResultsthis study reports the synergy found in vitro between the octapeptin OPX10053 and two lytic phages previously characterized by our research group (vB_KpnM-VAC13 and vB_KpnM-VAC66) against clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae. This synergy was validated by the FIC index, OD growth curves and time-kill assay when OPX10053 was added following 4 hours of phage exposure. Preliminary evaluation of toxicity revealed that OPX10053, even at subinhibitory concentrations and in phage combinations, exerts a toxic effect on larvae, which requires further investigation.\n\nConclusionsThe in vitro application of lytic phages in combination with octapeptin OPX10053 showed synergistic activity. Exposure of G. mellonella to the lytic phages was well tolerated, whereas combination treatment with subinhibitory concentrations of OPX10053 did not attenuate toxicity. Even so, this innovative approach of combining lytic phages could open the door to some interesting associations between chemically synthesized drugs and biological entities. Sequential or simultaneous application alongside time, dosing and stewardship warrants further research.",

    "abstract": "The effect of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on various gut-related diseases is intensively investigated in clinical trials. In addition to bacteria, the gut microbiome also contains eukaryotic, archaeal, and bacterial viruses (bacteriophages, in short phages), which collectively is referred to as the gut virome. Application of FMT in clinical settings is associated with a potential risk for the recipient of transferring infectious eukaryotic viruses or bacteria, despite strict screening procedures for the donor material. A safer and more targeted method to modulate the gut microbiota is therefore needed to extend the application width of FMT. Emerging evidence suggests that gut phages play a key role in maintaining a balanced gut microbiome as well as in FMT efficacy. Thus, a phageome from a cultured fecal donor microbiome may be a more efficient alternative to modulate the gut bacteriome than FMT. Here, we analyzed the dynamic changes of the viromes of mice cecal and human fecal matter inoculated chemostat cultures. Sequencing results showed that the relative abundance of eukaryotic viruses remarkably decreased during continuous cultivation, likely due to the lack of eukaryotic hosts. The corresponding phageome profiles showed dilution rate dependency, a reproducibility between biological replicates, and maintained high diversity of phages although being different from the inoculum phageome. This proof-of-concept study may constitute the first step of developing therapeutic tools to target a broad spectrum of gut-related diseases and thereby replacing FMT with a safer phage-mediated therapy.",

We sought to replicate this work to better understand the function of Krtcap3 but were unable to reproduce the adiposity phenotype. In the current work, WT female rats ate more compared to WT in the prior study, with corresponding increases in body weight and fat mass, while there were no changes in these measures in KO females between the studies. The prior study was conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic, while the current study started after initial lock-down orders and was completed during the pandemic with a generally less stressful environment. We hypothesize that the environmental changes impacted stress levels and may explain the failure to replicate our results. Analysis of corticosterone (CORT) at euthanasia showed a significant study by genotype interaction where WT had significantly higher CORT relative to KO in Study 1, with no differences in Study 2. These data suggest that decreasing Krtcap3 expression may alter the environmental stress response to influence adiposity. We also found that KO rats in both studies, but not WT, experienced a dramatic increase in CORT after their cage mate was removed, suggesting a separate connection to social behavioral stress. Future work is necessary to confirm and elucidate the finer mechanisms of these relationships, but these data indicate the possibility of Krtcap3 as a novel stress gene.",

Herein, we examine mitochondrial genomes to infer phylogenetic relationships and compare gene order and nucleotide composition between representative native European and invasive Ponto-Caspian taxa belonging to five families, ten genera, and 20 species (13 newly sequenced herein). We observe diverse gene rearrangement patterns in the phylogenetically disparate native species pool. Pallaseopsis quadrispinosa and Synurella ambulans show significant departures from the typical organization, with extensive translocations of tRNAs and the nad1 gene, as well as a tRNA-F polarity switch in the latter. The monophyletic alien Ponto-Caspian gammarids display a conserved gene order, mainly differing from the native species by a tRNA-E and tRNA-R translocation, which strengthens previous findings. However, extensive rearrangement is observed in Chaetogammarus warpachowskyi with translocations of six tRNAs. The alien corophiid, Chelicorophium curvispinum, displays a very conserved gene order despite its distant phylogenetic position. We also find that native species have a significantly higher GC and lower AT content than invasive ones.

As a 3-5 exonuclease and endonuclease, meiotic recombination 11 homolog A (MRE11A) is implicated in multiple DNA repair pathways. However, the role of MRE11A in MMR is unclear. Here, we show that MRE11A deficiency increased the sensitivity of HeLa cells to N-methyl-N nitro-N nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) treatment, implying a potential role of MRE11 in MMR. Moreover, we found MRE11A was largely recruited to chromatin and negatively regulated the DNA damage signals within the first cell cycle after MNNG treatment. We also showed that knockdown of MRE11A increased, while overexpressing MRE11A decreased, MMR activity in HeLa cells, suggesting that MRE11A negatively regulates MMR activity. Furthermore, we show that the recruitment of MRE11A to chromatin requires MLH1 and that MRE11A competes with PMS2 for binding to MLH1. This decreases PMS2 levels in whole cell and on chromatin, and consequently comprises MMR activity. Collectively, our findings reveal that MRE11A is a negative regulator of human MMR.",

    "abstract": "The pharyngeal arches are transient developmental structures that, in vertebrates, give rise to tissues of the head and neck. A critical process underlying the specification of distinct arch derivatives is segmentation of the arches along the anterior-posterior axis. Out-pocketing of the pharyngeal endoderm between the arches is a key mediator of this process, and although it is essential, mechanisms regulating out-pocketing vary between pouches and between taxa. Here, we focus on the patterning and morphogenesis of epithelia associated with the first pharyngeal arch, the first pharyngeal pouch (pp1) and the first pharyngeal cleft (pc1), and the role of Fgf8 dosage in these processes. We find that severe reductions of Fgf8 levels disrupt both pp1 and pc1 development. Notably, out-pocketing of pp1 is largely robust to Fgf8 reductions, however, pp1 extension along the proximal-distal axis fails when Fgf8 is low. Our data indicate that extension of pp1 requires physical interaction with pc1, and that multiple aspects of pc1 morphogenesis require Fgf8. In particular, Fgf8 is required for specification of regional identity in both pp1 and pc1, for localized changes in cell polarity, and for elongation and extension of both pp1 and pc1. Overall, our data indicate a critical role for the lateral surface ectoderm in segmentation of the first pharyngeal arch that has previously been under-appreciated.",

    "abstract": "Coxiella burnetii is a highly infectious pathogen that causes Q fever, a leading cause of culture-negative endocarditis. Coxiella first targets alveolar macrophages and forms a phagolysosome-like compartment called the Coxiella-Containing Vacuole (CCV). Successful host cell infection requires the Type 4B Secretion System (T4BSS), which translocates bacterial effector proteins across the CCV membrane into the host cytoplasm, where they manipulate numerous cell processes. Our prior transcriptional studies revealed that Coxiella T4BSS blocks IL-17 signaling in macrophages. Given that IL-17 is known to protect against pulmonary pathogens, we hypothesize that C. burnetii T4BSS downregulates intracellular IL-17 signaling to evade the host immune response and promote bacterial pathogenesis. Using a stable IL-17 promoter reporter cell line, we confirmed that Coxiella T4BSS blocks IL-17 transcription activation. Assessment of the phosphorylation state of NF-{kappa}B, MAPK, and JNK revealed that Coxiella downregulates IL-17 activation of these proteins. Using ACT1 knockdown and IL-17RA or TRAF6 knockout cells, we next determined that IL17RA-ACT1-TRAF6 pathway is essential for the IL-17 bactericidal effect in macrophages. In addition, macrophages stimulated with IL-17 generate higher levels of reactive oxygen species, which is likely connected to the bactericidal effect of IL-17. However, C. burnetii T4SS effector proteins block the IL-17-mediated oxidative stress, suggesting that Coxiella blocks IL-17 signaling to avoid direct killing by the macrophages.\n\nImportanceBacterial pathogens are constantly evolving mechanisms to modulate the hostile host environment encountered during infection. Coxiella burnetii, the causative agent of Q fever, is a fascinating example of intracellular parasitism. Coxiella survives in a phagolysosome-like vacuole and uses the Dot/Icm type IVB secretion system (T4BSS) to deliver bacterial effector proteins into the host cell cytoplasm to manipulate several host cell functions. We recently demonstrated that Coxiella T4BSS blocks the IL-17 signaling in macrophages. Here, we found that Coxiella T4BSS inhibits IL-17 activation of the NF-{kappa}B and MAPK pathways and blocks IL-17-mediated oxidative stress. These findings reveal a novel strategy employed by intracellular bacteria to escape the immune response during initial stages of infection. Further identification of virulence factors involved in this mechanism will bring to light new therapeutic targets to prevent Q fever development into a chronic life-threatening endocarditis.",
