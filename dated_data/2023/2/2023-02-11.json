    "abstract": "During tumorigenesis, a heterotypic interface exists between cancer and stromal cells that can both support and repress tumor growth. In the breast, studies have demonstrated a pro-tumorigenic role for adipocytes. However, the molecular mechanisms by which breast cancer cells coopt adipocytes remain elusive. Studying breast tumors and normal adjacent tissue (NAT) from several patient cohorts, patient-derived xenografts and mouse models, we show that lipolysis and lipolytic signaling are activated in NAT. We investigated the tumor-adipocyte interface and find that functional gap junctions form between breast cancer cells and adipocytes. As a result, cAMP, a critical lipolysis-inducing signaling molecule, is transferred from breast cancer cells to adipocytes and activates lipolysis in a gap junction-dependent manner. We found that gap junction formation depends upon connexin 31 (Cx31), and that Cx31 is essential for breast tumor growth and activation of lipolysis in vivo. Thus, direct tumor cell-adipocyte interaction is critical for tumorigenesis, and may serve as a new therapeutic target in breast cancer.\n\nOne sentence summaryGap junctions between breast cancer cells and adipocytes transfer cAMP and activate lipolysis in the breast tumor microenvironment.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCrowding is the failure to recognize an object due to surrounding clutter. Our visual crowding survey measured 13 crowding distances (or \"critical spacings\") twice in each of 50 observers. The survey included three eccentricities (0, 5, and 10 deg), four cardinal meridians, two orientations (radial and tangential), and two fonts (Sloan and Pelli). The survey also tested foveal acuity, twice. Remarkably, fitting a two-parameter model, the well- known Bouma law -- crowding distance grows linearly with eccentricity -- explains 82% of the variance for all 13 x 50 measured log crowding distances, cross-validated. An enhanced Bouma law, with factors for meridian, crowding orientation, target kind, and observer, explains 94% of the variance, again cross-validated. These additional factors reveal several asymmetries, consistent with previous reports, which can be expressed as crowding- distance ratios: 0.62 horizontal:vertical, 0.79 lower:upper, 0.78 right:left, 0.55 tangential:radial, and 0.78 Sloan font:Pelli font. Across our observers, peripheral crowding is independent of foveal crowding and acuity. Evaluation of the Bouma factor b (the slope of the Bouma law) as a biomarker of visual health would be easier if there were a way to compare results across crowding studies that use different methods. We define a standardized Bouma factor b that corrects for differences from Boumas 25 choice alternatives, 75% threshold criterion, and linearly symmetric flanker placement. For radial crowding on the right meridian, the standardized Bouma factor b is 0.24 for this study, 0.35 for Bouma (1970), and 0.30 for the geometric mean across five representative modern studies, including this one, showing good agreement across labs, including Boumas. We found that guaranteeing fixation by gaze-contingent display halved the standard deviation across observers of the estimated log b. The reduction in standard deviation is explained by a \"peeking\" model in which the observer looked near an anticipated target location in 50% of unmonitored-fixation trials. Individual differences are robust, as evidenced by the much larger 0.08 SD of log b across observers than the 0.03 SD of test-retest within observers. Crowdings ease of measurement enhances its promise as a biomarker for dyslexia and visual health.",

    "abstract": "Inferring relationships that go beyond our direct experience is essential for understanding our environment. This capacity requires either building representations that directly reflect structure across experiences as we encounter them, or computing the indirect relationships across experiences as the need arises. Building structure directly into overlapping representations allows for powerful learning and generalization in neural network models, but building these so-called distributed representations requires inputs to be encountered in interleaved order. We test whether interleaving similarly facilitates the formation of representations that directly integrate related experiences in humans, and what advantages such integration may confer for behavior. In a series of behavioral experiments, we present evidence that interleaved learning indeed promotes the formation of representations that directly link across related experiences. As in neural network models, interleaved learning gives rise to fast and automatic recognition of item relatedness, affords efficient generalization, and is especially critical for inference when learning requires statistical integration of noisy information over time. We use the data to adjudicate between several existing computational models of human memory and inference. The results demonstrate the power of interleaved learning and implicate the formation of integrated, distributed representations that support generalization in humans.",

    "abstract": "Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, support normal brain function and the brains response to disease and injury. The hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) is an area of microglial study due to its central role in many behavioral and cognitive functions. Interestingly, microglia and related cells are distinct in female vs. male rodents, even in early life. Indeed, postnatal day (P)-dependent sex differences in number, density, and morphology of microglia have been reported in certain hippocampal subregions at specific ages. However, sex differences in the DG have not yet been assessed at P10, a rodent developmental time point translationally relevant to human term gestation. To address this knowledge gap, Iba1+ cells in the DG (which are enriched in the Hilus and Molecular Layer) in female and male C57BL/6J mice were analyzed for their number (via stereology) and density (via stereology and via sampling). Next, Iba1+ cells were classified into published morphology categories. Finally, the percent of Iba1+ cells in each morphology category was multiplied by total cell number to generate a total number of Iba1+ cells in each morphological category. Results show no sex difference in Iba1+ cell number, density, or morphology in the P10 Hilus or Molecular Layer. The lack of sex difference in Iba1+ cells in P10 DG using commonly-employed methodologies (sampling, stereology, morphology classification) provides a baseline from which to interpret microglia changes seen after injury.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LISex differences in Iba1+ cells were assessed in the dentate gyrus (DG) of P10 mice\nC_LIO_LIIba1+ cells were assessed in DG microglia-rich subregions: Hilus and Molecular Layer\nC_LIO_LIBoth stereology and sampling approaches were used to quantify Iba1+ cells\nC_LIO_LINo sex difference found in Iba1+ cell number, density, or morphology in P10 mice DG\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Balancing selection is a form of natural selection maintaining diversity at the sites it targets and at linked nucleotide sites. Due to selection favouring heterozygosity, it has the potential to facilitate the accumulation of a \"sheltered\" load of tightly linked recessive deleterious mutations. However, precisely evaluating the extent of these effects has remained challenging. Taking advantage of plant self-incompatibility as one of the best-understood examples of long-term balancing selection, we provide a highly resolved picture of the genomic extent of balancing selection on the sheltered genetic load. We used targeted genome resequencing to reveal polymorphism of the genomic region flanking the self-incompatibility locus in three sample sets in each of the two closely related plant species Arabidopsis halleri and A. lyrata, and used 100 control regions from throughout the genome to factor out differences in demographic histories and/or sample structure. Nucleotide polymorphism increased strongly around the S-locus in all sample sets, but only over a limited genomic region, as it became indistinguishable from the genomic background beyond the first 25-30kb. Genes in this chromosomal interval exhibited no excess of mutations at 0-fold degenerated sites relative to putatively neutral sites, hence revealing no detectable weakening of the efficacy of purifying selection even for these most tightly linked genes. Overall, our results are consistent with the predictions of a narrow genomic influence of linkage to the S-locus, and clarify how natural selection in one genomic region affects the evolution of the adjacent genomic regions.",

    "abstract": "Certain subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in children have inferior outcome. One of these has a translocation t(7;12)(q36;p13) leading to a MNX1::ETV6 fusion along with high expression of MNX1. Here we identified the transforming event in this AML and possible ways of treatment. Only MNX1 was able to induce AML in mice, with similar gene expression and pathway enrichment to t(7;12) AML patient data. Importantly, this leukemia was only induced in immune incompetent mice using fetal but not adult hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. The restriction in transforming capacity to cells from fetal liver is in alignment with t(7;12)(q36;p13) AML being mostly seen in infants. Expression of MNX1 led to increased histone 3 lysine 4 mono-, di- and trimethylation, reduction in H3K27me3, accompanied with changes in genome-wide chromatin accessibility and genome expression, likely mediated through MNX1 interaction with the methionine cycle and methyltransferases. MNX1 expression increased DNA damage, depletion of the Lin-/Sca1+/c-Kit+ population and skewing toward the myeloid lineage. These effects, together with leukemia development, was prevented by pretreatment with the S-adenosylmethionine analog Sinefungin. In conclusion, we have shown the importance of MNX1 in development of AML with t(7;12), supporting a rationale for targeting MNX1 and downstream pathways.",

    "abstract": "The cerebral cortex underlies many of our unique strengths and vulnerabilities - but efforts to understand human cortical organization are challenged by reliance on incompatible measurement methods at different spatial scales. Macroscale features such as cortical folding and functional activation are accessed through spatially dense neuroimaging maps, whereas microscale cellular and molecular features are typically measured with sparse postmortem sampling. Here, we integrate these distinct windows on brain organization by building upon existing postmortem data to impute, validate and analyze a library of spatially dense neuroimaging-like maps of human cortical gene expression. These maps allow spatially unbiased discovery of cortical zones with extreme transcriptional profiles or unusually rapid transcriptional change which index distinct microstructure and predict neuroimaging measures of cortical folding and functional activation. Modules of spatially coexpressed genes define a family of canonical expression maps that integrate diverse spatial scales and temporal epochs of human brain organization - ranging from protein-protein interactions to large-scale systems for cognitive processing. These module maps also parse neuropsychiatric risk genes into subsets which tag distinct cyto-laminar features and differentially predict the location of altered cortical anatomy and gene expression in patients. Taken together, the methods, resources and findings described here advance our understanding of human cortical organization and offer flexible bridges to connect scientific fields operating at different spatial scales of human brain research.",

Here we examined the geometry of DNN models of visual cortex by quantifying the latent dimensionality of their natural image representations. A popular view holds that optimal DNNs compress their representations onto low-dimensional subspaces to achieve invariance and robustness, which suggests that better models of visual cortex should have low-dimensional geometries. Surprisingly, we found a strong trend in the opposite direction--neural networks with high-dimensional image subspaces tend to have better generalization performance when predicting cortical responses to held-out stimuli in both monkey electrophysiology and human fMRI data. These findings held across a diversity of design parameters for DNNs, and they suggest a general principle whereby high-dimensional geometry confers a striking benefit to DNN models of visual cortex.",

    "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a rapidly growing cause of morbidity with few treatment options available. Thus, accurate in vitro systems to test new therapies are indispensable. Recently, human liver organoid (HLO) NAFLD models have emerged. However, a systematic evaluation of their translational potential is currently missing. Here, we develop a structured approach to evaluate NAFLD-HLO models, testing oleic acid (OA) and palmitic acid (PA) in comparison to TGF-{beta}1 for disease induction. Through analysis of [~]100K single-cell transcriptomes of the HLO injury landscape, we find all three models induce inflammatory signatures. However, only TGF-{beta}1 promotes collagen production, fibrosis, and hepatic stellate cell (HSC) expansion. In striking contrast, OA ameliorates fibrotic signatures and reduces the HSC population. Integrating data from each model with that of NAFLD patients across disease progression further demonstrates PA and TGF-{beta}1 more robustly model inflammation and fibrosis. Our findings highlight the importance to stratify NAFLD-HLO models by clinical disease progression, provide a single-cell reference to benchmark future organoid injury models, and allow us to study evolving steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and HSC susceptibility to injury in a dynamic, multi-lineage human in vitro system.",

While short-term elevation in GCs is arguably beneficial for fitness components, previous studies have documented that the relationship between long-term baseline GCs elevation and fitness components can vary according to ecological and individual factors and according to the life-history of the species studied. Using longitudinal data on roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) from two populations facing markedly different environmental contexts, we tested whether baseline GC levels negatively correlate with body mass - a trait positively associated with demographic individual performance - on the short- to long-term. In support, higher baseline GC concentrations were associated to lighter body mass, both measured during the same capture event, in adults of both populations. Overall, we showed that despite the marked environmental and demographic differences between populations and despite the between-sex differences in life history (i.e. reproductive tactics), the relationship between body mass and GCs is consistent across environmental contexts, but might differ according to the life history stage of an individual. This work opens promising perspectives to further explore the relationship between GC and fitness-related traits according to life history stages in free-ranging mammals across seasonal and environmental contexts. The timing and context-dependence of GC levels highlight the complexity of studying stress responses in the wild.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe impact of chemical exposures on breast cancer progression is poorly characterized and may influence the development of more severe and aggressive subtypes.\n\nObjectivesThere is a suite of toxicants, including metals, pesticides, and personal care product compounds, which are commonly detected at high levels in US Center for Disease Controls National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) chemical biomarker screens. To characterize the impact of these toxicants on breast cancer pathways, we performed high throughput dose-response transcriptomic analysis of toxicant exposed breast cells.\n\nMethodsWe treated non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells, MCF10A, with 21 chemicals at four doses (25nM, 250nM, 2.5{micro}M, 25{micro}M) for 48 hours. We conducted RNA-sequencing for these 408 samples, adapting the PlexWell plate-based RNA-sequencing method to analyze changes in gene expression resulting from these exposures. For each chemical, we calculated gene and biological pathway specific benchmark doses using BMDExpress2, identifying differentially expressed genes and generating the best fit benchmark dose models for each gene. We employed enrichment testing to test whether each chemicals upregulated or downregulated genes were over-represented in a biological process or pathway. We contextualized benchmark doses relative to human population biomarker concentrations in NHANES.\n\nResultsOverall, significant changes in gene expression varied across doses of each chemical and benchmark dose modeling revealed dose-responsive alterations of thousands of different genes. Comparison of benchmark data to NHANES chemical biomarker concentrations indicated an overlap between actual exposure levels and levels sufficient to cause a gene expression response. Enrichment and cell deconvolution analyses showed benchmark dose responses correlated with changes in cancer and breast cancer related pathways, including induction of basal-like characteristics for some chemicals, including p,p-DDE, lead, copper, and methyl paraben.\n\nDiscussionThese analyses revealed that these 21 chemicals induce significant changes in pathways involved in breast cancer initiation and progression at human exposure relevant doses.",

    "abstract": "Infection directly influences adult hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function and differentiation, but much less is known about the fetal hematopoietic response to infection during pregnancy. Here, we investigated the fetal hematopoietic response to maternal infection with Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), an intracellular parasite that elicits Type II IFN{gamma}-mediated maternal immunity. The effects of maternal IFN{gamma} on developing HSCs and the signals that mediate these interactions have not been investigated. Our investigation reveals that the fetal HSCs respond to T. gondii infection with virulence-dependent changes in proliferation, self-renewal potential, and lineage output. We demonstrate that maternal IFN{gamma} crosses the fetal-maternal interface and is perceived by fetal HSCs. By comparing the effects of maternal IFN{gamma} injection with maternal T. gondii infection, our observations reveal that IFN{gamma} mimics aspects of the fetal HSC response to infection. Moreover, our data disentangle the role of infection-induced inflammatory cytokines in driving the expansion of downstream hematopoietic progenitors. Our findings illuminate that the fetal HSC response to prenatal infection is distinct from the adult HSC response to IFN{gamma}-induced inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Most malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) detect histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) and PfHRP3. Pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 gene deletions make parasites undetectable by RDTs. However, deletions have emerged where RDT use is uncommon and can occur independently of each other with pfhrp3 deletion more frequent in many parasite populations. To improve our understanding of geographic patterns and mechanisms of pfhrp3 deletion, we analyze 8,765 publicly available, whole-genome-sequenced P. falciparum field samples. Telomere healing is the only pfhrp2 deletion mechanism observed among the few available pfhrp2-deleted genomes. Three pfhrp3 deletion patterns predominate, all having chromosome 13 loss centromeric to pfhrp3 extending to the chromosome end: 1) chromosome 13 deletion at varied locations centromeric to pfhrp3 with signs of telomere healing (Asia; Pattern 13-); 2) congruent duplication of a chromosome 5 segment which includes multidrug-resistant 1 (pfmdr1) gene (Asia; Pattern 13-5++); and 3) congruent duplication of chromosome 11s subtelomeric region (Americas/Africa; Pattern 13-11++). The most frequently observed pattern 13-11++s centromeric boundary falls within the largest (15kb) known segmental duplication in the core genome. Long-read sequencing of pfhrp3-deleted isolates from Honduras (HB3) and Sudan (SD01) confirms 13-11 hybrid chromosomes. Our findings demonstrate that pfhrp3 deletion in the Americas and Africa often results from duplication-mediated non-allelic homologous recombination, likely a common occurrence in meiosis, while in Asia, deletion of pfhrp3 may be related to benefits of duplicating pfmdr1. Furthermore, this suggests that specific conditions including low transmission are needed for emergence of these deletions, a finding that can inform refined surveillance strategies.",

    "abstract": "The resilience of the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) to a high mutational pressure depends, in part, on negative purifying selection in the germline. A paradigm in the field has been that such selection, at least in part, takes place in primordial germ cells (PGCs). Specifically, Floros et al. (Nature Cell Biology 20: 144-51) reported an increase in the synonymity of mtDNA mutations (a sign of purifying selection) between pooled early-stage and late-stage PGCs. We re-analyzed Floros et al. pooled PGC data and noticed that their mutational dataset was significantly contaminated with single nucleotide variants (SNVs) derived from a nuclear sequence of mtDNA origin (NUMT) located on chromosome 5. Contamination was caused by co-amplification of the NUMT sequence by cross-specific PCR primers. Importantly, when we removed NUMT-derived SNVs, the evidence of purifying selection was abolished. In addition to pooled PGCs, Floros et al. reported the analysis of single late-stage PGCs, which were amplified with different sets of PCR primers that cannot amplify the NUMT sequence. Accordingly, we found no NUMT-derived SNVs among single PGCs mutations. Interestingly, single PGC mutations show a decrease of synonymity with increased intracellular mutant fraction. This pattern is incompatible with predominantly negative selection. This suggests that germline selection of mtDNA mutations is a complex phenomenon and that the part of this process that takes place in PGCs may be predominantly positive. However counterintuitive, positive germline selection of detrimental mtDNA mutations has been reported previously and potentially may be evolutionarily advantageous.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe circadian system drives near-24-h oscillations in behaviors and biological processes. The underlying core molecular clock regulates the expression of other genes, and it has been shown that the expression of more than 50 percent of genes in mammals displays 24-h rhythmic patterns, with the specific genes that cycle varying from one tissue to another. Determining rhythmic gene expression patterns in human tissues sampled as single timepoints has several challenges, including the reconstruction of temporal order of highly noisy data. Previous methodologies have attempted to address these challenges in one or a small number of tissues for which clock gene evolutionary conservation is assumed to be preserved. Here we introduce CIRCUST, a novel CIRCular-robUST methodology for analyzing molecular rhythms, that relies on circular statistics, is robust against noise, and requires fewer assumptions than existing methodologies. Next, we validated the method against two controlled experiments in which sampling times were known, and finally, CIRCUST was applied to 34 tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) dataset with the aim towards building a comprehensive daily rhythm gene expression atlas in humans. The validation and application shown here indicate that CIRCUST provides a flexible framework to formulate and solve the issues related to the analysis of molecular rhythms in human tissues.

    "abstract": "After stroke, impaired motor performance is linked to an increased demand for cognitive resources. Aerobic exercise improves cognitive function in healthy populations and may be effective in altering cognitive function post-stroke. We sought to determine if high intensity aerobic exercise paired with motor training in individuals with chronic stroke alters cognitive-motor function and functional connectivity between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a key region for cognitive-motor processes, and the sensorimotor network. Twenty-five participants with chronic stroke were randomly assigned to exercise (n = 14; 66 {+/-} 11 years; 4 females), or control (n = 11; 68 {+/-} 8 years; 2 females) groups. Both groups performed five-days of paretic upper limb motor training after either high intensity aerobic exercise (3 intervals of 3 minutes each, total exercise duration of 23-minutes) or watching a documentary (control). Resting-state fMRI, and TMT-A and B were recorded pre- and post-intervention. Both groups showed implicit motor sequence learning (p < .001), but there was no added benefit of exercise (p = .738). Regardless of group, the changes in task score (p = .025), and dwell time (p = .043) were correlated with a decrease in DLPFC-sensorimotor network functional connectivity (p = .024), which is thought to reflect a reduction in the cognitive demand and increased automaticity. The exercise group experienced greater overall cognitive-motor improvements measured with the trail making test part A (TMT-A: task score: p = .012; dwell time: p = .024; movement time: p = .567). Aerobic exercise may improve cognitive-motor processing speed post-stroke.\n\nSignificance statementAfter stroke, impaired motor performance is linked to an increased demand for cognitive resources. In our work we show that high intensity aerobic exercise paired with an implicit motor learning task improves cognitive-motor processing speed and reduces resting-state functional connectivity between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the sensorimotor network in individuals living with chronic stroke. These data likely reflect a reduction in cognitive resource dependence during a cognitive-motor task after stroke and a shift towards cognitive-motor automaticity.",

    "abstract": "Upon the secondary contact of populations, speciation with gene flow is greatly facilitated when the same pleiotropic loci are both subject to divergent ecological selection and induce non-random mating, leading to loci with this fortuitous combination of functions being referred to as \"magic trait\" loci. We use a population genetics model to examine whether \"pseudomagic trait\" complexes, composed of physically linked loci fulfilling these two functions, are as efficient in promoting premating isolation as magic traits. We specifically measure the evolution of choosiness, which controls the strength of assortative mating. We show that, surprisingly, pseudomagic trait complexes, and to a lesser extent also physically unlinked loci, can lead to the evolution of considerably stronger assortative mating preferences than do magic traits, provided polymorphism at the involved loci is maintained. This is because assortative mating preferences are generally favored when there is a risk of producing maladapted recombinants, as occurs with nonmagic trait complexes but not with magic traits (since pleiotropy precludes recombination). Contrary to current belief, magic traits may not be the most effective genetic architecture for promoting strong premating isolation. Distinguishing between magic traits and pseudomagic trait complexes is therefore important when inferring their role in premating isolation. This calls for further fine-scale genomic research on speciation genes.",

    "abstract": "Obligately parthenogenetic species are expected to be short lived since the lack of sex and recombination should translate into a slower adaptation rate and increased accumulation of deleterious alleles. Some, however, are thought to have been reproducing without males for millions of years. It is not clear how these old parthenogens can escape the predicted long-term costs of parthenogenesis, but an obvious explanation is cryptic sex.\n\nIn this study we screen for signatures of cryptic sex in eight populations of four parthenogenetic species of Timema stick insects, some estimated to be older than 1M yrs. Low genotype diversity, homozygosity of individuals and high linkage disequilibrium (LD) unaffected by marker distances support exclusively parthenogenetic reproduction in six populations. However, in two populations (namely, of the species Timema douglasi and T. monikensis) we find strong evidence for cryptic sex, most likely mediated by rare males. These populations had comparatively high genotype diversities, lower LD, and a clear LD decay with genetic distance. Rare sex in species that are otherwise largely parthenogenetic could help explain the unusual success of parthenogenesis in the Timema genus and raises the question whether episodes of rare sex are in fact the simplest explanation for the persistence of many old parthenogens in nature.",

The liverwort Marchantia polymorpha has a single functional MpNEK1 gene, whose knockout leads to twisted growth of rhizoids. MpNEK1 is also expressed in the meristem of vegetative flat organ, thallus, while its function remains unknown. Here, we generated transgenic lines for the inducible expression of MpNEK1 using an estrogen receptor mediated system. Estradiol treatment efficiently induced the accumulation of MpNEK1 mRNA and MpNEK1-Citrine fusion protein throughout plant body. Overexpression of MpNEK1 severely suppressed growth of rhizoids and thalli, eventually causing the lethality of juvenile plants. The effect of estradiol was reversible until 3 days, whereas 7-days treatment resulted in irreversible suppression of growth. This severe effect was observed even at the nanomolar level of estradiol. EdU staining and microtubule imaging clearly indicated the suppression of cell proliferation by estradiol-induced MpNEK1. Unexpectedly, the overexpression of kinase-deficient MpNEK1 also suppressed thallus growth and rhizoid formation, despite their slightly mild effect than the full length MpNEK1, indicating phosphorylation-independent mechanism of growth suppression. In conclusion, overexpression of MpNEK1 suppresses cell division and elongation, leading to growth cessation and lethality. Our results imply that the expression of MpNEK1 is tightly regulated and plant NEKs might control cell division as in fungi and animals.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine system dysfunction is commonly implicated in adolescent-onset neuropsychiatric disorders. Although psychosis symptoms can be alleviated by antipsychotics, cognitive symptoms remain unresponsive to such pharmacological treatments and novel research paradigms investigating the circuit substrates underlying cognitive deficits are critically needed. The frontal cortex and its dopaminergic input from the midbrain are implicated in cognitive functions and undergo maturational changes during adolescence. Here, we used mice carrying mutations in the Arc or DISC1 genes to model mesofrontal dopamine circuit deficiencies and test circuit-based neurostimulation strategies to restore cognitive functions. We found that in a memory-guided spatial navigation task, frontal cortical neurons were activated coordinately at the decision-making point in wild-type but not Arc mutant mice. Chemogenetic stimulation of midbrain dopamine neurons or optogenetic stimulation of frontal cortical dopamine axons in a limited adolescent period consistently reversed genetic defects in mesofrontal innervation, task-coordinated neuronal activity, and memory-guided decision-making at adulthood. Furthermore, adolescent stimulation of dopamine neurons also reversed the same cognitive deficits in DISC1 mutant mice. Our findings reveal common mesofrontal circuit alterations underlying the cognitive deficits caused by two different genes and demonstrate the feasibility of adolescent neurostimulation to reverse these circuit and behavioral deficits. These results may suggest developmental windows and circuit targets for treating cognitive deficits in neurodevelopmental disorders.",

We realized that availability of a potent and selective small molecule probe targeting CDKL5 could enable illumination of its roles in normal development as well as in diseases where it has become aberrant due to mutation. We prepared analogs of AT-7519, a known inhibitor of several cyclin dependent and cyclin-dependent kinase-like kinases that has been advanced into Phase II clinical trials. We identified analog 2 as a highly potent and cell-active chemical probe for CDKL5/GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3). Evaluation of its kinome-wide selectivity confirmed that analog 2 demonstrates excellent selectivity and only retains GSK3/{beta} affinity. As confirmation that our chemical probe is a high-quality tool to use in directed biological studies, we demonstrated inhibition of downstream CDKL5 and GSK3/{beta} signaling and solved a co-crystal structure of analog 2 bound to CDKL5. A structurally similar analog (4) proved to lack CDKL5 affinity and maintain potent and selective inhibition of GSK3/{beta}. Finally, we used our chemical probe pair (2 and 4) to demonstrate that inhibition of CDKL5 and/or GSK3/{beta} promotes the survival of human motor neurons exposed to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We have demonstrated a neuroprotective phenotype elicited by our chemical probe pair and exemplified the utility of our compounds to characterize the role of CDKL5/GSK3 in neurons and beyond.",

Recent work on granular matter provides a path by which to define the roles of passive, stochastic mechanisms in nonequilibrium systems. Here, we apply such a framework to examine the role of thermodynamic parameters to cell ingression, the movement of cells from one tissue layer to another that has been attributed, in part, to directional cues. Using the murine neural crest as a model system, we provide evidence that a stochastic mechanism, rather than a proposed stiffness gradient, underlies cell ingression. Cortical fluctuations representing effective temperature and cell packing configurations generate an entropic trap that promotes cell ingression. The results imply dissipative mechanisms that transiently disorder tissue underlie some morphogenetic events.",

The myofibroblast-like GRN was mostly expressed in plaques that were vulnerable in females. Finally, mice orthologs of the female myofibroblast-like genes showed retained expression in advanced plaques from female mice but were downregulated in male mice during atherosclerosis progression. Female atherosclerosis is driven by GRNs that promote a fibrous vulnerable plaque rich in myofibroblast-like SMCs.",

AMPK phosphorylation was observed in the liver of OVXR mice. CR also increased hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride levels. The reductions in the level of TBARS in the serum and liver and of H2O2 in the liver of OVXR mice suggested alterations in the redox state of the liver. Although expression of catalase protein was reduced by CR, expression of superoxide dismutase was not altered by CR. Although interleukin IL-6 and IL-10 levels in OVXR mice were similar to those in Sham mice, macrophage infiltration was reduced in OVXR mice. OVXR mice had increased sirtuin1 levels and decreased sirtuin3 levels in the liver. In conclusion, CR improved the condition of ovariectomized mice by reducing adiposity and increasing insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance through a mechanism that may involve AMPK.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRegulatory T cells (Tregs) are protective in atherosclerosis but reduced during disease progression due to cell death and loss of stability. However, the mechanisms of Treg dysfunction remain unknown. Oxidized phospholipids (oxPLs) are abundant in atherosclerosis and can activate innate immune cells, but there is limited information regarding their impact on T cells. Given Treg loss during atherosclerosis progression and oxPL levels in the plaque microenvironment, we sought to determine whether oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (oxPAPC), an oxPL associated with atherosclerotic plaques, alters Treg differentiation and function.\n\nMethodsNaive CD4+ T cells were cultured under Treg, Th1, and Th17 polarizing conditions with or without oxPAPC and assessed by flow cytometry. Gene expression in oxPAPC-treated Tregs was analyzed by bulk RNA sequencing. Functional studies of oxPAPC-induced Tregs were performed by co-culturing Tregs with CTV-labeled CD8+ cells in vitro. In vivo suppression of atherosclerosis was evaluated by adoptively transferring control or oxPAPC-treated Tregs to hyperlipidemic Ldlr-/- mice.\n\nResultsCompared to controls, oxPAPC-treated Tregs were less viable but expressed higher levels of the Th1-associated markers T-bet, CXCR3, and IFN-{gamma}. Th1 and Th17 skewing cultures were unaltered by oxPAPC. IFN-{gamma} is linked to Treg instability, thus Treg polarization experiments were repeated using Ifngr1-/- CD4+ T cells. IFN{gamma}R1 deficiency did not improve cell viability in oxPAPC-treated Tregs, however, T-bet and IFN-{gamma} expression was not increased suggesting a role for IFN-{gamma} signaling. OxPAPC-treated Tregs were less suppressive in vitro, and adoptive transfer studies in hyperlipidemic Ldlr-/- mice showed that oxPAPC-induced Tregs possessed altered tissue homing and were insufficient to inhibit atherosclerosis progression.\n\nConclusionsOxPAPC elicits Treg-specific changes that induce a Th1-like phenotype dependent on IFN-{gamma} signaling. This is biologically relevant as oxPAPC-treated Tregs are unable to reduce atherosclerosis progression in Ldlr-/- mice. This study supports a role for oxPLs in negatively impacting Treg differentiation and atheroprotective function.",

    "abstract": "Bats (order Chiroptera) are a major reservoir for emerging and re-emerging zoonotic viruses. Their tolerance towards highly pathogenic human viruses led to the hypothesis that bats may possess an especially active antiviral interferon (IFN) system. Here, we cloned and functionally characterized the virus RNA sensor, Retinoic Acid-Inducible Gene-I (RIG-I), from the \"microbat\" Myotis daubentonii (suborder Yangochiroptera) and the \"megabat\" Rousettus aegyptiacus (suborder Yinpterochiroptera), and compared them to the human ortholog. Our data show that the overall sequence and domain organization is highly conserved and that all three RIG-I orthologs can mediate a similar IFN induction in response to viral RNA at 37{degrees} and 39{degrees}C, but not at 30{degrees}C. Like human RIG-I, bat RIG-Is were optimally activated by double stranded RNA containing a 5-triphosphate end and required Mitochondrial Antiviral-Signalling Protein (MAVS) for antiviral signalling. Moreover, the RIG-I orthologs of humans and of R. aegyptiacus, but not of M. daubentonii, enable innate immune sensing of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results thus show that microbats and megabats express a RIG-I that is not substantially different from the human counterpart with respect to function, temperature dependency, antiviral signaling, and RNA ligand properties, and that human and megabat RIG-I are able to sense SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nIMPORTANCEA common hypothesis holds that bats (order Chiroptera) are outstanding reservoirs for zoonotic viruses because of a special antiviral interferon (IFN) system. However, functional studies about key components of the bat IFN system are rare. RIG-I is a cellular sensor for viral RNA signatures that activates the antiviral signalling chain to induce IFN. We cloned and functionally characterized RIG-I genes from representatives of the suborders Yangochiroptera and Yinpterochiroptera. The bat RIG-Is were conserved in their sequence and domain organization, and similar to human RIG-I in (i) mediating virus- and IFN-activated gene expression, (ii) antiviral signalling, (iii) temperature dependence, and (iv) recognition of RNA ligands. Moreover, RIG-I of Rousettus aegyptiacus (suborder Yinpterochiroptera) and of humans were found to recognize SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, members of both bat suborders encode RIG-Is that are comparable to their human counterpart. The ability of bats to harbour zoonotic viruses therefore seems due to other features.",

One of those roles is the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments. This renewal is under circadian regulation and peaks after light onset. Connexin 43 (Cx43) is the most predominantly expressed gap junction protein in RPE. In this study, we examine how gap junctions and specifically, Cx43 phosphorylation, contribute to phagocytosis in both human embryonic stem cell derived RPE and mouse RPE monolayers. We show that both Rac1 and CDK5 have differences in protein localization at different points in phagocytosis, and that by using their effectors, the capability of RPE for phagocytosis changes. CDK5 has not yet been reported in RPE tissue, and here we show that it likely regulates Cx43 localization and resulting electrical coupling. We find that gap junctions in RPE are temporally highly dynamic during phagocytosis and that regulation of gap junctions via phosphorylation is likely critical for maintaining eye health.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDPeripheral artery disease (PAD) is a major risk factor for lower-extremity amputation in diabetic patients caused by an insufficient angiogenic response. Unfortunately, therapeutic angiogenesis using growth factors, such as the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), are ineffective in diabetic conditions due to diabetes-induced growth factor resistance. The apelinergic system (APJ receptor/apelin) is highly upregulated under hypoxic condition and acts as an activator of angiogenesis. Apelin treatment has been shown to improve revascularization in nondiabetic models of ischemia, however, its role on angiogenesis in diabetic conditions remains poorly investigated. Thus, this study explored the impact of Pyr-apelin-13 in endothelial cell function and diabetic mouse model of hindlimb ischemia.\n\nMETHODSNondiabetic and diabetic mice underwent femoral artery ligation to induce lower limb ischemia. A group of diabetic mice was implanted subcutaneously with osmotic pumps delivering Pyr-apelin-13 for 28 days. Blood flow reperfusion was measured for 4 weeks post-surgery and exercise willingness was assessed in individual cages with voluntary wheels. In vitro, BAECs were exposed to normal (NG) or high glucose (HG) levels and hypoxia. Cell migration, proliferation and tube formation assays were performed following either VEGF or Pyr-apelin-13 stimulation.\n\nRESULTSFollowing limb ischemia, blood flow reperfusion, functional recovery of the limb and vascular density were improved in diabetic mice receiving Pyr-apelin-13 compared to untreated diabetic mice. In cultured BAECs, exposure to HG concentrations and hypoxia reduced VEGF proangiogenic actions, whereas apelin proangiogenic effects remained unaltered. Pyr-apelin-13 induced its proangiogenic actions through Akt/AMPK/eNOS and RhoA/ROCK signaling pathways under both NG or HG concentrations and hypoxia exposure.\n\nCONCLUSIONSPyr-apelin-13 promoted endothelial cell function and angiogenesis in the ischemic limb despite diabetes and HG level exposure. Therefore, our results identified the apelinergic system as a potential therapeutic target for angiogenic therapy in diabetic patients with PAD.\n\nHighlightsO_LISustained delivery of Pyr-apelin-13 improves blood flow reperfusion, functional recovery of the hindlimb and capillary density in diabetic mice following ischemia.\nC_LIO_LIUnlike VEGF, signaling pathways and proangiogenic actions induced by apelin/APJ stimulation are not impaired by high glucose exposure.\nC_LIO_LIDespite the presence of tissue ischemia, diabetes reduces the expression of apelin and APJ in the ischemic adductor muscle, an effect overcome by apelin administration.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Polymicrobial diseases significantly impact the health of humans and animals but remain understudied in natural systems. We recently described the Pacific Oyster Mortality Syndrome (POMS), a polymicrobial disease that impacts oyster production and is prevalent worldwide. Analysis of POMS-infected oysters on the French North Atlantic coast revealed that the disease involves co-infection with the endemic ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1) and virulent bacterial species such as Vibrio crassostreae. However, it is unknown whether consistent Vibrio populations are associated with POMS in different regions, how Vibrio contribute to POMS, and how they interact with the OsHV-1 virus during pathogenesis.\n\nWe resolved the Vibrio population structure in oysters from a Mediterranean ecosystem and investigated their functions in POMS development. We find that Vibrio harveyi and Vibrio rotiferianus are the predominant species found in OsHV-1-diseased oysters and show that OsHV-1 is necessary to reproduce the partition of the Vibrio community observed in the field. By characterizing the interspecific interactions between OsHV-1, V. harveyi and V. rotiferianus, we find that only V. harveyi synergizes with OsHV-1. When co-infected, OsHV-1 and V. harveyi behave cooperatively by promoting mutual growth and accelerating oyster death. V. harveyi showed high virulence potential in oysters and dampened host cellular defenses, making oysters a more favorable niche for microbe colonization. We next investigated the interactions underlying the co-occurrence of diverse Vibrio species in diseased oysters. We found that V. harveyi harbors genes responsible for the biosynthesis and uptake of a key siderophore called vibrioferrin. This important resource promotes the growth of V. rotiferianus, a cheater that efficiently colonizes oysters during POMS without costly investment in host manipulation nor metabolite sharing.\n\nBy connecting field-based approaches, laboratory infection assays and functional genomics, we have uncovered a web of interdependencies that shape the structure and function of the POMS pathobiota. We showed that cooperative behaviors contribute to synergy between bacterial and viral co-infecting partners. Additional cheating behaviors further shape the polymicrobial consortium. Controlling such behaviors or countering their effects opens new avenues for mitigating polymicrobial diseases.",

We developed TRMC-seq method to compreshensively profile tRNA ac4C sites and uncovered the presence of ac4C in a broader range of tRNA isoacceptors than previous studies. Multi-omics analysis identified AP-1 signaling pathway as a major downstream mediator of NAT10. Mechanistically, we found NAT10 is responsible for the translation efficiency genes which contain higher ac4C-tRNA codon.

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes are assembled from proteins encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. These dual-origin enzymes pose a complex gene regulatory challenge for cells, in which gene expression must be coordinated across organelles using distinct pools of ribosomes. How cells produce and maintain the accurate subunit stoichiometries for these OXPHOS complexes remains largely unknown. To identify genes involved in dual-origin protein complex synthesis, we performed FACS-based genome-wide screens analyzing mutant cells with unbalanced levels of mitochondrial- and nuclear-encoded subunits of cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV). We identified novel genes involved in OXPHOS biogenesis, including two uncharacterized genes: PREPL and NME6. We found that PREPL specifically regulates Complex IV biogenesis by interacting with mitochondrial protein synthesis machinery, while NME6, an uncharacterized nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK), controls OXPHOS complex biogenesis through multiple mechanisms reliant on its NDPK domain. First, NME6 maintains local mitochondrial pyrimidine triphosphate levels essential for mitochondrial RNA abundance. Second, through stabilizing interactions with RCC1L, NME6 modulates the activity of mitoribosome regulatory complexes, leading to disruptions in mitoribosome assembly and mitochondrial RNA pseudouridylation. Taken together, we propose that NME6 acts as a link between compartmentalized mitochondrial metabolites and mitochondrial gene expression. Finally, we present these screens as a resource, providing a catalog of genes involved in mitonuclear gene regulation and OXPHOS biogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Estimating phenotype networks is a growing field in computational biology. It helps deepen the understanding of disease etiology and is useful in many applications. In this study, we present a method that constructs a phenotype network by assuming a Gaussian linear structure model embedding a directed acyclic graph (DAG). We utilize genetic variants as instrumental variables and show how our method only requires access to summary statistics from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a reference panel of genotype data. Besides estimation, a distinct feature of the method is its summary statistics-based likelihood ratio test on directed edges. We applied our method to estimate a causal network of 29 cardiovascular-related proteins and linked the estimated network to Alzheimers disease (AD). A simulation study was conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. An R package implementing the proposed method and an R Shiny App for the visualization of the estimated protein network are being made available.",

    "abstract": "Steroid hormones control various cellular activities in a context-dependent manner. For example, ecdysone, which acts through a type II nuclear receptor, has seemingly opposite effects in Drosophila wing precursors, promoting proliferation during larval stages, and triggering proliferation arrest at pupariation. We find that wing precursors proliferate normally in the complete absence of the ecdysone receptor (EcR), whether ecdysone is present or not, suggesting that ecdysone overrides a default antiproliferative activity of the receptor. By contrast, termination of proliferation by high concentration of 20E at the end of larval life involves conventional gene regulation by the ligand-receptor complex. The switch from one mode of regulation to the other is determined by ligand level, as measured with a calibrated EcR transcriptional reporter and ex vivo proliferation assays. Accordingly, RNA Seq analysis uncovers distinct transcriptional responses to different doses of ecdysone. Some genes are only activated at high doses (high threshold targets) and likely to comprise genes that stop proliferation at pupariation, when ecdysone titres are high. We find that other target genes respond to all physiological concentrations of ecdysone. Some of these genes are known to promote proliferation and could therefore contribute to the pro-proliferation activity of low-level ecdysone. Finally, we show mathematically and with synthetic reporters that relatively simple combinations of regulatory elements can recapitulate the behaviour of both types of target genes.",

    "abstract": "Factor XI (FXI), a protein in the intrinsic coagulation pathway, can be activated by two enzymes. In hemostasis, FXI is activated by thrombin, while FXIIa-mediated activation is prothrombotic. The interactions between FXI and its activating enzymes are poorly understood due to their transient nature. Here, we applied structural proteomics, molecular dynamics simulations and binding assays to investigate the interface between thrombin and FXI including the dynamics underlying FXI activation. We demonstrate that activation of FXI is a multi-staged process, where thrombin first binds to Pro520 on FXI, after which it migrates towards the activation site by engaging the apple 1 domain and finally Arg378. We validated with known mutation sites and additionally found that Pro520 is conserved in prekallikrein (PK). This enables binding of thrombin even though it cannot activate PK. Understanding the exact binding of thrombin to FXI points a way for future interventions for bleeding or thrombosis.",

The presumed homodimeric oligomerization of cis-AT assembly lines is insufficient to provide similar reaction chambers; however, the crystal structure of a ketosynthase (KS)+AT didomain presented here and three already reported show an interaction between the AT domains appropriate for lateral multimerization. This interaction was used to construct a framework for the pikromycin PKS from its KS, AT, and docking domains that contains highly-ordered reaction chambers.

    "abstract": "Intestinal epithelial cells play important roles in the absorption of nutrients, secretion of electrolytes and food digestion. The function of these cells is strongly influenced by purinergic signalling activated by extracellular ATP (eATP) and other nucleotides. The activity of several ecto-enzymes determines the dynamic regulation of eATP. In pathological contexts, eATP may act as a danger signal controlling a variety of purinergic responses aimed at defending the organism from pathogens present in the intestinal lumen.\n\nIn this study, we characterized the dynamics of eATP on polarised and non-polarised Caco-2 cells. eATP was quantified by luminometry using the luciferin-luciferase reaction. Results show that non-polarized Caco-2 cells triggered a strong but transient release of intracellular ATP after hypotonic stimuli, leading to low micromolar eATP accumulation. Subsequent eATP hydrolysis mainly determined eATP decay, though this effect could be counterbalanced by eATP synthesis by ecto-kinases kinetically characterized in this study. In polarized Caco-2 cells, eATP showed a faster turnover at the apical vs the basolateral side.\n\nTo quantify the extent to which different processes contribute to eATP regulation, we created a data-driven mathematical model of the metabolism of extracellular nucleotides. Model simulations showed that eATP recycling by ecto-AK is more efficient a low micromolar eADP concentrations and is favored by the low eADPase activity of Caco-2 cells. Simulations also indicated that a transient eATP increase could be observed upon the addition of non-adenine nucleotides due the high ecto-NDPK activity in these cells. Model parameters showed that ecto-kinases are asymmetrically distributed upon polarization, with the apical side having activity levels generally greater in comparison with the basolateral side or the non-polarized cells.\n\nFinally, experiments using human intestinal epithelial cells confirmed the presence of functional ecto-kinases promoting eATP synthesis. The adaptive value of eATP regulation and purinergic signalling in the intestine is discussed.\n\nAuthors summaryIntestinal epithelial cells play important roles in the absorption of nutrients, secretion of electrolytes and food digestion. When intracellular ATP is released into the intestinal milieu, either at the lumen or the internal side, the resulting extracellular ATP can act as an alert signal to engage cell surface purinergic receptors that activate the immune defence of the organism against pathogens.\n\nWe worked with Caco-2 and primary human intestinal cell, and our results showed that extracellular ATP regulation is a complex network of reactions that simultaneously consume or generate ATP in whole viable intestinal epithelial cells. In particular, we created a mathematical model, fitted to experimental data, that allowed to quantify the degree to which intracellular ATP release and the activity of a variety of ectoenzymes controlling the concentration of extracellular ATP in a complex way.",

Neutrophil dysregulation, specifically unbalanced neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, plays a critical role in the prognosis and progression of multiple diseases, including COVID-19. hPSCs can provide a limitless supply of neutrophils (iNeutrophils) to study these processes and discover and validate targets in vitro. However, current iNeutrophil differentiation protocols are inefficient and generate heterogeneous cultures consisting of different granulocytes and precursors, which can confound the study of neutrophil biology. Here, we describe a method to dramatically improve iNeutrophils yield, purity, functionality, and maturity through the deletion of the transcription factor GATA1. GATA1 knockout (KO) iNeutrophils are nearly identical to primary neutrophils in cell surface marker expression, morphology, and host defense functions. Unlike wild type (WT) iNeutrophils, GATA1 KO iNeutrophils generate NETs in response to the physiologic stimulant lipopolysaccharide (LPS), suggesting they could be used as a more accurate model when performing small-molecule screens to find NET inhibitors. Furthermore, through CRSPR/Cas9 deletion of CYBB we demonstrate that GATA1 KO iNeutrophils are a powerful tool in quickly and definitively determining involvement of a given protein in NET formation.",

    "abstract": "Most habitats on earth are colonized by diverse bacterial communities, offering ample opportunities for inter-species interactions. While competition for space and nutrients might often dominate such interactions, little is known about whether bacteria can sense competitors and mount specific responses to withstand their attacks. The competition-sensing hypothesis proposes that bacteria can do so through nutrient stress and cell damage cues. Here, we conducted a replicated RNAseq-transcriptomic study to test this hypothesis. We exposed Pseudomonas aeruginosa to either its own spent medium or to the supernatant of its competitor Burkholderia cenocepacia. Compared to controls, we detected significant changes in the transcriptome of P. aeruginosa that entail both general responses to spent medium and specific responses to the competitor. Specifically, genes encoding various competitive traits, including the type-VI secretion system, the siderophore pyoverdine, and the toxins phenazines and hydrogen cyanide, were upregulated when exposed to the competitor supernatant. Similarly, several genes coding for stress response and quorum-sensing regulators were overexpressed. Moreover, we found transcriptional responses to vary as a function of iron availability, whereby metabolically more costly responses were launched under iron rich conditions. Altogether, our results reveal nuanced competitive responses of P. aeruginosa when exposed to B. cenocepacia supernatant, integrating both environmental and social cues.",

Invasive species lag behind crops and other economically important species in this respect, representing a lack of tools for management and land conservation efforts.\n\nMethodologyThe mitogenome of Microstegium vimineum, one of the most damaging invasive plant species in North America, was sequenced and analyzed using long-read data, providing a resource for biologists and managers. We conducted analyses of genome content, phylogenomic analyses among grasses and relatives based on mitochondrial coding regions, and an analysis of mitochondrial single nucleotide polymorphism in this invasive grass species.\n\nPivotal ResultsThe assembly is 478,010 bp in length and characterized by two large, inverted repeats, and a large, direct repeat. However, the genome could not be circularized, arguing against a \"master circle\" structure. Long-read assemblies with data subsets revealed several alternative genomic conformations, predominantly associated with large repeats. Plastid-like sequences comprise 2.4% of the genome, with further evidence of Class I and Class II transposable element-like sequences. Phylogenetic analysis placed M. vimineum with other Microstegium species, excluding M. nudum, but with weak support. Analysis of polymorphic sites across 112 accessions of M. vimineum from the native and invasive ranges revealed a complex invasion history.\n\nConclusionsWe present an in-depth analysis of mitogenome structure, content, phylogenetic relationships, and range-wide genomic variation in M. vimineums invasive US range. The mitogenome of M. vimineum is typical of other andropogonoid grasses, yet mitochondrial sequence variation across the invasive and native ranges is extensive. Our findings suggest multiple introductions to the US over the last century, with subsequent spread, secondary contact, long-distance dispersal, and possibly post-invasion selection on awn phenotypes. Efforts to produce genomic resources for invasive species, including sequenced mitochondrial genomes, will continue to provide tools for their effective management, and to help predict and prevent future invasions.",

While the structure of LECT2 in its globular form has been determined by X-ray crystallography, structures of LECT2 amyloid fibrils remain unknown. Using single particle cryo-EM, we now find that human LECT2 forms robust twisting fibrils with canonical amyloid features. At their core, LECT2 fibrils contain two mating protofilaments, the ordered core of each protofilament spans residues 55-75 of the LECT2 sequence. The overall geometry of the LECT2 fibril displays features in line with other pathogenic amyloids. Its core is tightly packed and stabilized by a network of hydrophobic contacts and hydrogen-bonded uncharged polar residues, while its outer surface displays several charged residues. The robustness of LECT2 fibril cores is illustrated by their limited dissolution in 3M urea and their persistence after treatment with proteinase K. As such, the LECT2 fibril structure presents a potential new target for treatments against ALECT2.",

Through CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic screens in an ALT-immortalized isogenic cellular model, here we identify histone lysine demethylase KDM2A as a molecular vulnerability selectively for cells contingent on ALT-dependent telomere maintenance. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that KDM2A is required for dissolution of the ALT-specific telomere clusters following homology-directed telomere DNA synthesis. We show that KDM2A promotes de-clustering of ALT multitelomeres through facilitating isopeptidase SENP6-mediated SUMO deconjugation at telomeres. Inactivation of KDM2A or SENP6 impairs post-recombination telomere de-SUMOylation and thus dissolution of ALT telomere clusters, leading to gross chromosome missegregation and mitotic cell death. These findings together establish KDM2A as a selective molecular vulnerability and a promising drug target for ALT-dependent cancers.",

    "abstract": "Immune networks that control antimicrobial and inflammatory mechanisms have overlapping regulation and functions to ensure effective host responses. Genetic interaction studies of immune pathways that compare host responses in single and combined knockout backgrounds are a useful tool to identify new mechanisms of immune control during infection. For disease caused by pulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections, which currently lacks an effective vaccine, understanding genetic interactions between protective immune pathways may identify new therapeutic targets or disease-associated genes. Previous studies suggested a direct link between the activation of NLRP3-Caspase1 inflammasome and the NADPH-dependent phagocyte oxidase complex during Mtb infection. Loss of the phagocyte oxidase complex alone resulted in increased activation of Caspase1 and IL1{beta} production during Mtb infection, resulting in failed disease tolerance during the chronic stages of disease. To better understand this interaction, we generated mice lacking both Cybb, a key subunit of the phagocyte oxidase, and Caspase1/11. We found that ex vivo Mtb infection of Cybb-/-Caspase1/11-/- macrophages resulted in the expected loss of IL1{beta} secretion but an unexpected change in other inflammatory cytokines and bacterial control. Mtb infected Cybb-/-Caspase1/11-/- mice rapidly progressed to severe TB, succumbing within four weeks to disease characterized by high bacterial burden, increased inflammatory cytokines, and the recruitment of granulocytes that associated with Mtb in the lungs. These results uncover a key genetic interaction between the phagocyte oxidase complex and Caspase1/11 that controls protection against TB and highlight the need for a better understanding of the regulation of fundamental immune networks during Mtb infection.",

    "abstract": "STAT3 function in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) has been difficult to discern as Stat3 deficiency in the hematopoietic system induces systemic inflammation, which can impact HSPC activity. To address this, we established mixed bone marrow (BM) chimeric mice with CreER-mediated Stat3 deletion in 20% of the hematopoietic compartment. Stat3-deficient HSPCs had impaired hematopoietic activity and failed to undergo expansion in BM in contrast to Stat3-sufficient (CreER) controls. Single-cell RNA sequencing of Lin-ckit+Sca1+ BM cells revealed altered transcriptional responses in Stat3-deficient hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and multipotent progenitors, including intrinsic activation of cell cycle, stress response, and interferon signaling pathways. Consistent with their deregulation, Stat3-deficient Lin-ckit+Sca1+ cells accumulated {gamma}H2AX over time. Following secondary BM transplantation, Stat3-deficient HSPCs failed to reconstitute peripheral blood effectively, indicating a severe functional defect in the HSC compartment. Our results reveal essential roles for STAT3 in HSCs and suggest the potential for using targeted synthetic lethal approaches with STAT3 inhibition to remove defective or diseased HSPCs.\n\nKey PointsO_LISTAT3 is critical for hematopoietic activity and hematopoietic stem cell maintenance in non-inflammatory conditions\nC_LIO_LISTAT3 has a cell-intrinsic role in the suppression of interferon signaling and myeloid-skewed transcription in hematopoietic stem cells\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Chronic elevation of sphingolipids contributes to {beta}-cell failure. ORMDL3 has been identified as a key regulator of sphingolipid homeostasis, however, its function in pancreatic {beta}-cell pathophysiology remains unclear. Here, we generated a mouse model lacking Ormdl3 within pancreatic {beta}-cells (Ormdl3{beta}-/-). We show that loss of {beta}-cell Ormdl3 does not alter glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, islet morphology, or cellular ceramide levels on standard chow diet. When challenged with a high fat diet, while Ormdl3{beta}-/- mice did not exhibit any alteration in metabolic parameters or islet architecture, lipidomics analysis revealed significantly higher levels of very long chain ceramides in their islets. Taken together, our results reveal that loss of Ormdl3 alone is not sufficient to impinge upon {beta}-cell function or whole-body glucose and insulin homeostasis, but loss of Ormdl3 does alter specific sphingolipid levels.",

    "abstract": "Ecosystem restoration is becoming a widely recognised solution to the biodiversity crisis. However, there is a gap between restoration science and practice. Specifically, we lack a theoretical framework which would improve our understanding of ecosystems recovery and allow us to optimise restoration design. Here, we narrow this gap by developing spatially explicit metacommunity models and studying the recovery dynamics of communities during restoration. We show that community response depends on how damaged the landscape is prior to restoration, with highly fragmented landscapes imposing greater challenges to community recovery. In such cases, we found that the recovery depends on the type of interaction and the structure of the interaction network. Finally, we demonstrate that community recovery can be maximised with careful spatial planning. When recovering communities composed of antagonistic interactions, restoration should target areas adjacent to the most species-rich sites. In the case of mutualistic communities, the same strategy should be adopted in the short-term, whereas in the long-term, restoration should be extended to sites that improve the overall connectivity of the landscape. Our results highlight the importance of considering interactions between species and spatial planning in restoration projects.",

    "abstract": "Copy number variations (CNVs) of the human 16p11.2 locus are associated with several developmental/neurocognitive syndromes. Particularly, deletion and duplication of this genetic interval are found in patients with autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disability and other psychiatric traits. The high gene density associated with the region and the strong phenotypic variability of incomplete penetrance, make the study of the 16p11.2 syndromes extremely complex. To systematically study the effect of 16p11.2 CNVs and identify candidate genes and molecular mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology, mouse models were generated previously and showed learning and memory, and to some extent social deficits. To go further in understanding the social deficits caused by 16p11.2 syndromes, we engineered deletion and duplication of the homologous region to the human 16p11.2 genetic interval in two rat outbred strains, Sprague Dawley (SD) and Long Evans (LE). The 16p11.2 rat models displayed convergent defects in social behaviour and only a few cognitive defects. Interestingly major pathways affecting MAPK3 and CUL3 were found altered in the rat 16p11.2 models with additional changes in males compared to females. Altogether, the consequences of the 16p11.2 genetic region dosage on social behaviour are now found in three different species: humans, mice and rats. In addition, the rat models pointed to sexual dimorphism, with lower severity of phenotypes in rat females compared to male mutants. This phenomenon is also observed in humans. We are convinced that the two rat models will be key to further investigating social behaviour and understanding the brain mechanisms and specific brain regions that are key to controlling social behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Blood vessel formation is an important initial step for bone formation during development as well as during remodelling and repair in the adult skeleton. This results in a heavily vascularized tissue where endothelial cells and skeletal cells are constantly in crosstalk to facilitate homeostasis, a process that is mediated by numerous environment signals, including mechanical loading. Breakdown in this communication can lead to disease and/or poor fracture repair. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the role of mature bone cells in regulating angiogenesis, how this is influenced by a dynamic mechanical environment, and understand the mechanism by which this could occur. Herein, we demonstrate that both osteoblasts and osteocytes coordinate endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and blood vessel formation via a mechanically dependent paracrine mechanism. Moreover, we identified that this process is mediated via the secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs), as isolated EVs from mechanically stimulated bone cells elicited the same response as seen with the full secretome, while the EV depleted secretome did not elicit any effect. Despite mechanically activated bone cell derived EVs (MA-EVs) driving a similar response to VEGF treatment, MA-EVs contain minimal quantities of this angiogenic factor. Lastly, a miRNA screen identified mechanoresponsive miRNAs packaged within MA-EVs which are linked with angiogenesis. Taken together, this study has highlighted an important mechanism in osteogenic-angiogenic coupling in bone and has identified the mechanically activated bone cell derived EVs as a therapeutic to promote angiogenesis and potentially bone repair.",

Here, we report the deubiquitylase USP10 as an APC-truncation- specific enhancer of {beta}-Catenin stability, potentiating WNT signalling in CRC and cancer stem cells. Mechanistically, interaction studies in various CRC cell lines and in vitro binding studies, together with computational modelling, revealed that USP10 binding to {beta}-Catenin is mediated via the unstructured N-terminus of USP10 and requires the absence of full-length APC. Notably, loss of USP10 in CRISPR engineered intestinal organoids reduces tumorigenic properties of CRC and blocks the super competitor-signalling of APC-mutated CRC. Furthermore, reduction of USP10 induces the expression of differentiation genes, and opposes the APC-truncated phenotype in an intestinal hyperplasia model of D.melanogaster.\n\nTaken together, our findings reveal USP10s role in intestinal tumourigenesis by stabilising {beta}-Catenin, leading to aberrant WNT signalling, enhancing cancer cell stemness and implicate the DUB USP10 as a cancer specific therapeutic vulnerability in Apc truncated CRC.",

    "abstract": "Chloroplasts are the site of photosynthesis. In land plants, chloroplast biogenesis is regulated by a family of transcription factors named GOLDEN2-like (GLK). In C4 grasses, it has been hypothesized that genome duplication events led to the sub-functionalization of GLK paralogs (GLK1 and GLK2) to control chloroplast biogenesis in two distinct cell types: mesophyll and bundle sheath cells. Although previous characterization of golden2 (g2) mutants in maize has demonstrated a role for GLK2 paralogs in regulating chloroplast biogenesis in bundle sheath cells, the function of GLK1 has remained elusive. Here we show that, contrary to expectations, GLK1 is not required for chloroplast biogenesis in mesophyll cells of maize. Comparisons between maize and Setaria viridis, which represent two independent C4 origins within the Poales, further show that the role of GLK paralogs in controlling chloroplast biogenesis in mesophyll and bundle sheath cells differs between species. Despite these differences, complementation analysis revealed that GLK1 and GLK2 genes from maize are both sufficient to restore functional chloroplast development in mesophyll and bundle sheath cells of Setaria viridis mutants. Collectively our results suggest an evolutionary trajectory in C4 grasses whereby both orthologs retained the ability to induce chloroplast biogenesis but GLK2 adopted a more prominent developmental role, particularly in relation to chloroplast activation in bundle sheath cells.",

Although there exist excellent computational models for predicting DNA binding domains from protein sequence (Stormo, 2013), models for predicting activation domains from protein sequence have lagged behind (Erijman et al., 2020; Ravarani et al., 2018; Sanborn et al., 2021), particularly in metazoans. We recently developed a simple and accurate predictor of acidic activation domains on human transcription factors (Staller et al., 2022). Here, we show how the accuracy of this human predictor arises from the balance between hydrophobic and acidic residues, which together are necessary for acidic activation domain function. When we combine our predictor with the predictions of neural network models trained in yeast, the intersection is more predictive than individual models, emphasizing that each approach carries orthogonal information. We synthesize these findings into a new set of activation domain predictions on human transcription factors.",

    "abstract": "Brazil has a very large biological variety, which is an almost inexhaustible source of substances of pharmacological and biotechnological interest. Several studies have demonstrated the presence of bioactive peptides in insect hemolymph and their potential use as therapeutic agents. However, few data are available regarding molecules extracted from insects with anti-apoptotic action. The objective of this work was to identify and isolate proteins from the hemolymph of caterpillars of the Megalopygidae family with pharmacological and biotechnological interest. Two species of this family were studied, Podalia sp and Megalopyge albicolis. Cytotoxicity tests on Vero and Sf-9 cells revealed that the hemolymph of both caterpillars was cytotoxic only at concentrations greater than 5%v/v. In the anti-apoptotic activity assays, it was verified that the supplementation of cell cultures with only 1% of hemolymph v/v is sufficient to inhibit cell death by apoptosis induced by different inducers such as terbutyl, actinomycin D, hydrogen peroxide, or even by nutrient depletion. For this study, cells were stained with trypan blue, crystal violet, and fluorescent markers to cytoskeleton (actin and tubulin), mitochondria membrane electric potential (JC-1), and apoptosis marker (acridine orange and ethidium). The protein responsible for anti-apoptotic action was isolated through gel filtration chromatography, using an AKTA purifier high-resolution liquid chromatography system. The hemolymph was fractionated into 3 pools for Podalia sp and 6 pools for M. abicolis. In the antiapoptotic tests, semi-purified hemolymph from both caterpillars showed anti-apoptotic effect in VERO and SF-9 cells, pre-treated with only 1% v/v of hemolymph and induced to death by different and apoptotic inductors. Was observed that the molecule with anti-apoptotic effect is present in pool 3 in both hemolymphs. This protector effect blocked and attenuated the disruption of the cytoskeleton (actin filaments), being that the protective effect also was observed on the integrity of the mitochondrial membrane of SF-9 cells pre-treated with both hemolymphs and treated with the apoptosis inducer Terbutil at concentrations of 25 to 100M. By acting on the mitochondrial pathway of death by apoptosis, a pathway that can cause disorders and diseases neurodegenerative such as Parkinsons and Alzheimers diseases, substances present in the hemolymph of these and others caterpillars could be good candidates in studies for the treatment of these diseases.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDuring infectious diseases, pro-inflammatory cytokines transiently destabilize interactions between adjacent vascular endothelial cells (ECs) to facilitate the passage of immune molecules and cells into tissues. However, in the lung the resulting vascular hyperpermeability can lead to organ dysfunction. Previous work identified the transcription factor ERG as a master regulator of endothelial homeostasis. Here we investigate whether the sensitivity of pulmonary blood vessels to cytokine-induced destabilization is due to organotypic mechanisms affecting the ability of endothelial ERG to protect lung ECs from inflammatory injury.\n\nMethodsCytokine-dependent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of ERG was analyzed in cultured Human Umbilical Vein ECs (HUVECs). Systemic administration of TNF or the bacterial cell wall component lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to cause a widespread inflammatory challenge in mice; ERG protein levels were assessed by immunoprecipitation, immunoblot, and immunofluorescence. Murine Erg deletion was genetically induced in ECs (Ergfl/fl;Cdh5(PAC)CreERT2), and multiple organs were analyzed by histology, immunostaining, and electron microscopy.\n\nResultsIn vitro, TNF promoted the ubiquitination and degradation of ERG in HUVECs, which was blocked by the proteasomal inhibitor MG132. In vivo, systemic administration of TNF or LPS resulted in a rapid and substantial degradation of ERG within lung ECs, but not ECs of the retina, heart, liver, or kidney. Pulmonary ERG was also downregulated in a murine model of influenza infection. Ergfl/fl;Cdh5(PAC)-CreERT2 mice spontaneously recapitulated aspects of inflammatory challenges, including lung-predominant vascular hyperpermeability, immune cell recruitment, and fibrosis. These phenotypes were associated with a lung-specific decrease in the expression of Tek, a gene target of ERG previously implicated in maintaining pulmonary vascular stability during inflammation.\n\nConclusionsCollectively, our data highlight a unique role for ERG in pulmonary vascular function. We propose that cytokine-induced ERG degradation and subsequent transcriptional changes in lung ECs play critical roles in the destabilization of pulmonary blood vessels during infectious diseases.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotics have been an essential part of modern medicine since their initial discovery. The continuous search for new antibiotic candidates remains a necessity given the increasing emergence of resistance to antimicrobial compounds among pathogens. The glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs) represent an important group of last resort antibiotics which inhibit bacterial growth through non-covalent binding to the cell wall precursor lipid II. The so far reported GPAs exhibit an enormous diversity in the biosynthetic gene clusters that encode their production, which is in turn reflected in the variety of their structures. GPAs are typically composed of seven amino acids, which are highly crosslinked and decorated with a variable collection of sugar moieties as well as other modifications. Based on their structural characteristics, they have been classified into four main types. More recently, atypical GPAs have been identified that differ from type I-IV GPAs in both their structure and function and have consequently been classified as type V GPAs. Given these differences, we studied the phylogeny of all gene sequences related to the biosynthesis of the GPAs and observed a clear evolutionary diversification between the lipid II binding GPA classes and the so-called type V GPAs. Here we suggest the adoption of a phylogeny-driven reclassification and a separation of classical lipid II binding GPAs from type V GPAs, which we propose to identify instead as glycopeptide- related peptides (GRPs).",

    "abstract": "Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an adverse reaction to heparin leading to a reduction in circulating platelets with an increased risk of thrombosis. It is precipitated by polymerized immune complexes consisting of pathogenic antibodies that recognize a small chemokine platelet factor 4 (PF4) bound to heparin, which trigger platelet activation and a hypercoagulable state. Characterization of these immune complexes is extremely challenging due to the enormous structural heterogeneity of such macromolecular assemblies and their constituents (especially heparin). We use native mass spectrometry to characterize small immune complexes formed by PF4, heparin and monoclonal HIT-specific antibodies. Up to three PF4 tetramers can be assembled on a heparin chain, consistent with the results of molecular modeling studies showing facile polyanion wrapping along the polycationic belt on the PF4 surface. Although these assemblies can accommodate a maximum of only two antibodies, the resulting immune complexes are capable of platelet activation despite their modest size. Taken together, these studies provide further insight into molecular mechanisms of HIT and other immune disorders where anti-PF4 antibodies play a central role.",
