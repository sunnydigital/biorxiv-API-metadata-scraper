    "abstract": "Dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) analysis of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data has yielded insights into many neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. A common dFNC analysis approach uses hard clustering methods like k-means clustering to assign samples to states that summarize network dynamics. However, hard clustering methods obscure network dynamics by assuming (1) that all samples within a cluster are equally like their assigned centroids and (2) that samples closer to one another in the data space than to their centroids are well-represented by their centroids. In addition, it can be hard to compare subjects, as in some cases an individual may not manifest a state strongly enough to enter a hard cluster. Approaches that allow a dimensional approach to connectivity patterns (e.g., fuzzy clustering) can mitigate these issues. In this study, we present an explainable fuzzy clustering framework by combining fuzzy c-means clustering with several explainability metrics. We apply our framework for schizophrenia (SZ) default mode network analysis, identifying 5 states and characterizing those states with a new explainability approach. While also showing that features typically used in hard clustering can be extracted in our framework, we present a variety of unique features to quantify state dynamics and identify effects of SZ upon network dynamics. We further uncover relationships between symptom severity and interactions of the precuneus with the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex. Given the ease of implementing our framework and its enhanced insight into network dynamics, it has great potential for use in future dFNC studies.",

    "abstract": "Chronic opioid exposure induces tolerance to the pain-relieving effects of opioids but sensitization to some other effects. While the occurrence of these adaptations is well-understood, the underlying cellular mechanisms are less clear. This study aimed to determine how chronic treatment with morphine, a prototypical opioid agonist, induced adaptations to subsequent morphine signaling in different subcellular contexts. Opioids acutely inhibit glutamatergic transmission from medial thalamic (MThal) inputs to the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) via activity at -opioid receptors (MORs). MORs are present in somatic and presynaptic compartments of MThal neurons terminating in both the DMS and ACC. We investigated the effects of chronic morphine treatment on subsequent morphine signaling at MThal-DMS synapses, MThal-ACC synapses, and MThal cell bodies in male and female mice. Surprisingly, chronic morphine treatment increased subsequent morphine inhibition of MThal-DMS synaptic transmission (morphine facilitation), but decreased subsequent morphine inhibition of transmission at MThal-ACC synapses (morphine tolerance) in a sex-specific manner; these adaptations were present in male but not female mice. Additionally, these adaptations were not observed in knockin mice expressing phosphorylation-deficient MORs, suggesting a role of MOR phosphorylation in mediating both facilitation and tolerance to morphine within this circuit. The results of this study suggest that the effects of chronic morphine exposure are not ubiquitous; rather adaptations in MOR function may be determined by multiple factors such as subcellular receptor distribution, influence of local circuitry and sex.",

    "abstract": "Proper brain function depends on intact neurovascular coupling (NVC). Through NVC, local cerebral blood flow (CBF) is rapidly increased in activated cerebral regions to meet the corresponding demands of neural activities. NVC has been believed to support advanced cerebral functions such as complex emotional homeostasis. However, few studies provide causal link evidence with specific molecular and cellular identities. Here, using RNAscope, cell-type specific conditional knockout (cKO) perturbation in BL6/C57 mice, laser speckle contrast imaging, and mouse behavior assays, we demonstrated that the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor noncore subunit NR2D is only expressed in cerebral arteriole smooth muscle cells (aSMCs) but not in peripheral aSMCs. Both aSMC-NR2D cKO and aSMC-NR2D+NMDA receptor subunit 1 (NR1) double cKO mice displayed a severe decline in functional hyperemia induced by whisker stimulation. In addition, the NR2D pathway was independent of previously demonstrated COX-2-PGE2-dependent mechanism and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced impairments in NVC. Caldesmon is a potential downstream protein in the NR2D pathway for NVC regulation. Notably, we demonstrated that NVC deficits caused abnormalities in complex emotional behaviors, such as anxiety-like behaviors (exhibiting increased defecation and urine), reduced curiosity and decreased fear instinct (displaying less fear of aggressive CD1 mice). Furthermore, fear-response gene c-FOS expression in the amygdala neurons was attenuated in aSMC-NR2D knockout mice after response to acute stresses. In contrast, its expression level remained unchanged in the non-fear-related cerebral regions such as the piriform cortex and hippocampus. These findings demonstrated that inadequate functional hyperemia impaired cerebral complex emotional functions and suggested a co-existence of anxiety and fearlessness in single individuals.",

    "abstract": "Bivalent mRNA vaccine boosters expressing Omicron BA.5 spike and ancestral D614G spike were introduced to attempt to boost waning antibody titers and broaden coverage against emerging SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Previous reports showed that peak serum neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers against SARS-CoV-2 variants following bivalent booster were similar to peak titers following monovalent booster. It remains unknown whether these antibody responses would diverge over time. We assessed serum virus-neutralizing titers in 41 participants who received three monovalent mRNA vaccine doses followed by bivalent booster, monovalent booster, or BA.5 breakthrough infection at one month and three months after the last vaccine dose or breakthrough infection using pseudovirus neutralization assays against D614G and Omicron subvariants (BA.2, BA.5, BQ.1.1, and XBB.1.5). There was no significant difference at one month and three months post-booster for the two booster cohorts. BA.5 breakthrough patients exhibited significantly higher NAb titers at three months against all Omicron subvariants tested compared against monovalent and bivalent booster cohorts. There was a 2-fold drop in mean NAb titers in the booster cohorts between one and three month time points, but no discernible waning of titers in the BA.5 breakthrough cohort over the same period. Our results suggest that NAb titers after boosting with one dose of bivalent mRNA vaccine are not higher than boosting with monovalent vaccine. Perhaps inclusion of D614G spike in the bivalent booster exacerbates the challenge posed by immunological imprinting. Hope remains that a second bivalent booster could induce superior NAb responses against emerging variants.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the outcome of interactions between species is central to our current understanding of diversity maintenance. However, we have limited information about the robustness of many model-based predictions of species coexistence. This limitation is partly because several sources of uncertainty are often ignored when making predictions. Here, we introduce a framework to simultaneously explore how different mathematical models, different environmental contexts, and parameter uncertainty impact the probability of predicting species coexistence. Using a set of pairwise competition experiments on annual plants, we provide direct evidence that subtle differences between models lead to contrasting predictions of both coexistence and competitive exclusion. We also show that the effects of environmental context-dependency and parameter uncertainty on predictions of species coexistence are not independent of the model used to describe population dynamics. Our work suggests that predictions of species coexistence and extrapolations thereof may be particularly vulnerable to these underappreciated founts of uncertainty.",

Overall, we find that communal breeding in trios leads to higher output and that both trio-breeding and overlapping litters are associated with increased neonatal survival. However, we find significant strain-level variation in optimal breeding strategy and show that the tradeoff between strategies is weakly heritable. We further find that strain reproductive condition influences the ability to support multiple litters and alters the related evolutionary tradeoffs of communal breeding. Together, these findings underscore the role of genetics in regulating alternative reproductive tactics in house mice and emphasize the need to adopt animal husbandry practices tailored to strain backgrounds.",

    "abstract": "The ability of unevolved amino acid sequences to become biological catalysts was key to the emergence of life on Earth. However, billions of years of evolution separate complex modern enzymes from their simpler early ancestors. To study how unevolved sequences can develop new functions, we screened for enzymatic activity in a collection of > 1 million novel sequences based on a de novo 4-helix bundle library of semi-random sequences. To mirror evolutionary selection for biological function, we screened the collection using ultrahigh-throughput droplet microfluidics to identify features that yield phosphoesterase activity. Characterization of active hits demonstrated that acquiring new function required a large jump in sequence space: screening enriched for truncations that removed > 40% of the protein chain and introduced a catalytically important cysteine. The truncated protein dimerized into a dynamic -helical structure, consistent with the idea that gain of function was accompanied by an increase in structural dynamics relative to the parental 4-helix bundle. The purified protein catalyzes the hydrolysis of a range of phosphodiesters, with the greatest activity toward the biological second messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP). The novel cAMPase is a manganese-dependent metalloenzyme and catalyzes cAMP hydrolysis with a rate acceleration on the order of 109 and catalytic proficiency on the order of 1014 M-1, comparable to large enzymes shaped by billions of years of evolution. These findings suggest that fragmentation to modular primordial peptides can be a fertile avenue for introducing structural and functional diversity into proteins.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=67 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/528392v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@180e004org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f32a75org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16876aforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@147ffc9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Vast majority of cellular activities are carried out by protein complexes that assembled dynamically in response to cellular needs and environmental cues. Large scale efforts had uncovered a large repertoire of functionally uncharacterized protein complexes which necessitate new strategies to delineate their roles in various cellular activities and diseases. Thermal proximity co-aggregation profiling could be readily deployed to simultaneously characterize the dynamics for hundreds to thousands of protein complexes in situ across different cellular conditions. Toward this goal, we had optimized the original method both experimentally and computationally. In this new iteration termed Slim-TPCA, fewer temperatures are used which increase throughputs by over 3X, while coupled with new scoring metrics and statistical evaluation resulted in minimal compromise in coverage and the detection of more relevant protein complexes. Overall, less samples are needed, false positives from batch effects are minimized and statistical evaluation time is reduced by two orders of magnitude. We applied Slim-TPCA to profile state of protein complexes in K562 cells under different duration of glucose deprivation. More protein complexes are found dissociated based on TPCA signature in accordance with expected downregulation of most cellular activities. These complexes include 55S ribosome and various respiratory complexes in mitochondria revealing the utility of TPCA to study protein complexes in organelles. On other hand, protein complexes involved in protein transport and degradation are found increasingly associated revealing their involvement in metabolic reprogramming during glucose deprivation. In summary. Slim-TPCA is an efficient strategy for proteome-wide characterization of protein complexes. The various algorithmic improvement of Slim-TPCA is available as Python package at https://pypi.org/project/Slim-TPCA/",

Prior work demonstrated that mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) inhibitors suppress HSC activation and fibrosis in a mouse model of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). In the present study, pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of the MPC in HSC decreased expression of markers of activation in vitro. MPC knockdown also reduced the abundance of several intermediates of the TCA cycle, and diminished -ketoglutarate played a key role in attenuating HSC activation by suppressing hypoxia inducible factor-1 signaling. On high fat diets, mice with HSC-specific MPC deletion exhibited reduced circulating transaminases, numbers of HSC, and hepatic expression of markers of HSC activation and inflammation compared to wild-type mice. These data suggest that MPC inhibition modulates HSC metabolism to attenuate activation and illuminate mechanisms by which MPC inhibitors could prove therapeutically beneficial for treating MASH.",

    "abstract": "After acute brain injury, neuronal apoptosis may overwhelm the capacity for microglial phagocytosis, creating a queue of dying neurons awaiting clearance. The size of this queue should be equally sensitive to changes in neuronal death and the rate of phagocytosis. Using rodent organotypic hippocampal slice cultures as a model of acute perinatal brain injury, serial imaging demonstrated that the capacity for microglial phagocytosis of dying neurons was overwhelmed for two weeks. Altering phagocytosis rates, e.g. by changing the number of microglia, dramatically changed the number of visibly dying neurons. Similar effects were generated when the visibility of dying neurons was altered by changing the membrane permeability for vital stains. Canonically neuroprotective interventions such as seizure blockade and neurotoxic maneuvers such as perinatal ethanol exposure were mediated by effects on microglial activity and the membrane permeability of apoptotic neurons, and had either no or opposing effects on healthy surviving neurons.\n\nSignificanceAfter acute brain injury, microglial phagocytosis is overwhelmed by the number of dying cells. Under these conditions, the assumptions on which assays for neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects are based are no longer valid. Thus longitudinal assays of healthy cells, such as assessment of the fluorescence emission of transgenically-expressed proteins, provide more accurate estimates of cell death than do single-time-point anatomical or biochemical assays. More accurate estimates of death rates will increase the translatability of preclinical studies of neuroprotection and neurotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "As the juncture between the body and environment, epithelia are both protective barriers and sensory interfaces that continually renew. To determine whether sensory neurons remodel to maintain homeostasis, we used in vivo two-photon imaging of somatosensory axons innervating Merkel cells in adult mouse skin. These touch receptors were highly plastic: 63% of Merkel cells and 89% of branches appeared, disappeared, grew, regressed and/or relocated over a month. Interestingly, Merkel-cell plasticity was synchronized across arbors during rapid epithelial turnover. When Merkel cells remodeled, the degree of plasticity between Merkel-cell clusters and their axons was well correlated. Moreover, branches were stabilized by Merkel-cell contacts. These findings highlight the role of epithelial-neural crosstalk in homeostatic remodeling. Conversely, axons were also dynamic when Merkel cells were stable, indicating that intrinsic neural mechanisms drive branch plasticity. Two terminal morphologies innervated Merkel cells: transient swellings called boutons, and stable cups termed kylikes. In Atoh1 knockout mice that lack Merkel cells, axons showed higher complexity than control mice, with exuberant branching and no kylikes. Thus, Merkel cells limit axonal branching and promote branch maturation. Together, these results reveal a previously unsuspected high degree of plasticity in somatosensory axons that is biased, but not solely dictated, by plasticity of target epithelial cells. This system provides a platform to identify intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms that govern axonal patterning in epithelial homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Hundreds of proteins determine the function of synapses, and synapses define the neuronal circuits that subserve myriad brain, cognitive, and behavioral functions. It is thus necessary to precisely manipulate specific proteins at specific sub-cellular locations and times to elucidate the roles of particular proteins and synapses in brain function. We developed PHOtochemically TArgeting Chimeras (PHOTACs) as a strategy to optically degrade specific proteins with high spatial and temporal precision. PHOTACs are small molecules that, upon wavelength-selective illumination, catalyze ubiquitylation and degradation of target proteins through endogenous proteasomes. Here we describe the design and chemical properties of a PHOTAC that targets Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha (CaMKII), which is abundant and crucial for baseline synaptic function of excitatory neurons. We validate the PHOTAC strategy, showing that the CaMKII-PHOTAC is effective in mouse brain tissue. Light activation of CaMKII-PHOTAC removed CaMKII from regions of the mouse hippocampus only within 25 m of the illuminated brain surface. The optically-controlled degradation decreases synaptic function within minutes of light activation, measured by the light-initiated attenuation of evoked field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) responses to physiological stimulation. The PHOTACs methodology should be broadly applicable to other key proteins implicated in synaptic function, especially for evaluating their precise roles in the maintenance of long-term potentiation and memory within subcellular dendritic domains.",

    "abstract": "Specific wiring is essential for sensory systems to precisely relay information to higher brain regions. The retina, an approachable part of the brain, is an ideal model for studying neural circuits due to its well-organized structure. In the retina, S-cone photoreceptors sense and relay short-wavelength (e.g., blue) light signals for encoding color information and other environmental cues. S-cones usually account for less than 10% of cones and are precisely connected to S-cone bipolar cells (SCBCs). This connection is ancient and highly conserved across species, indicating essential functions. How this wiring specificity is formed and maintained, however, is not understood. To unveil the molecular mechanisms underlying this highly specific connection, we sequenced the transcriptomes of thirteen-lined ground squirrel (TLGS) photoreceptors. We chose TLGS for their cone-rich retina and the absence of cones that co-express multiple opsin proteins, as compared to mice. We used a targeted SMART-seq approach to obtain high-resolution transcriptomes from S- and M-cone photoreceptors and identified a cell-adhesion molecule, Nrxn3, as a potential candidate mediating the S-cone to SCBC connection. Given the limitations of genetic manipulation in TLGS, we utilized mouse models to study the function of Nrxn3 in S-cones. In  true S-cones (S-opsin+/M-opsin-) that lack Nrxn3 expression, the number of connections with SCBCs was drastically reduced, indicating a critical role of Nrxn3 for this synapse. While neurexins are well known for their diverse roles in regulating various synapses, this study is the first to document its crucial role in mediating or maintaining a specific synapse in the central nervous system. In addition, the differentially expressed genes identified here provide a valuable resource for further investigating cone subtype-specific functions.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) has evolved the ability to persist after uptake into host immune cells. This intracellular niche enables S. aureus to potentially escape host immune responses and survive the action of antibiotics. The elevated tolerance of S. aureus to small molecule antibiotics is likely to be multifactorial. We pose that there may be contributions related to permeation into phagosome, which would require translocation across two mammalian bilayers. To empirically test this, we adapted our recently developed permeability assay to determine the accumulation of FDA-approved antibiotics in phagocytic vacuoles. Bioorthogonal reactive handles were metabolically anchored within the surface of S. aureus, and complementary tags were chemically added to antibiotics. Following phagocytosis of labeled S. aureus cells, we were able to specifically analyze the accumulation levels of antibiotics within the phagosomes of infected macrophages. Our findings enabled the determination of differences between the permeability of antibiotics to extra- and intracellular S. aureus, thus providing a roadmap to dissect the contribution of antibiotic permeability to intracellular pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Broadcast spraying of antibiotics in crops is widely used for controlling bacterial plant pathogens. The effects of antibiotics on non-target (and especially beneficial) organisms in cropping systems, however, are not well studied. Pollinators are of particular concern because in pear and apple crops, antibiotics for controlling fire blight (Erwinia amylovora) are sprayed during bloom, likely exposing pollinators. This is especially relevant as laboratory evidence suggests that antibiotics could have sublethal effects on bee foraging behavior and colony health. But to our knowledge these potential impacts have not been studied in field settings. Here, we compared the effects of two fire blight control methods, a single spray of an antibiotic (oxytetracycline) and a biological antagonist (Aureobasidium pullulans), on honey bee (Apis mellifera) foraging, pollination, and fruit set in pear orchards. Complementing these field assessments, we conducted laboratory experiments to examine the effects of these treatments on locomotion and foraging behavior of the bumble bee species, Bombus vosnesenskii. We found that honey bees visited fewer flowers and foraged longer on each flower in orchards sprayed with antibiotics than with biological product, but there were no differences in pollination and seed set. The pear cultivars we worked in, however, can self-pollinate. In the lab, we found that feeding on high doses of either the antibiotic or the biological antagonist reduced bumble bee foraging behavior relative to controls. The limited impact of antibiotics on pear pollination observed in this study suggest that antibiotics pose a low economic risk to pear growers, especially for self-compatible cultivars. Still, crops with higher pollinator dependence may be more affected by reductions in pollinator visitation. Future studies should examine the impacts of multiple antibiotic sprays within a season, which are common during warm springs, and their long-term health impacts on both individual bees and colonies.\n\nHighlightsO_LIAntibiotics are sprayed on many crops to control plant bacterial pathogens.\nC_LIO_LIThe impacts of antibiotics on beneficial organisms in agriculture are unknown.\nC_LIO_LIWe studied antibiotic impacts on bee behavior and pollination function in pears.\nC_LIO_LIBees exposed to antibiotics visit fewer flowers and this could impact bee fitness.\nC_LIO_LIDespite decreased bee visitation, we did not detect a reduction in crop pollination.\nC_LI\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=83 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/528407v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (34K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17c2189org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7dd952org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4696beorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@52b7fd_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) dosed into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) distribute broadly throughout the brain and hold the promise of treating myriad brain diseases by modulating RNA. CNS tissue is not routinely biopsied in living individuals, leading to reliance on CSF biomarkers to inform on drug target engagement. Animal models can link CSF biomarkers to brain parenchyma, but our understanding of how individual cells contribute to bulk tissue signal is limited. Here we employed single nucleus transcriptomics on tissue from mice treated with RNase H1 ASOs against Prnp and Malat1 and macaques treated with an ASO against PRNP. Activity was observed in every cell type, though sometimes with substantial differences in magnitude. Single cell RNA count distributions implied target suppression in every single sequenced cell, rather than intense knockdown in only some cells. Duration of action up to 12 weeks post-dose differed across cell types, being shorter in microglia than in neurons. Suppression in neurons was generally similar to, or more robust than, the bulk tissue. In macaques, PrP in CSF was lowered 40% in conjunction with PRNP knockdown across all cell types including neurons, arguing that a CSF biomarker readout is likely to reflect disease-relevant cells in a neuronal disorder.",

    "abstract": "Visual hallucinations (VHs) are perceptions of objects or events in the absence of the sensory stimulation that would normally support such perceptions. Although all VHs share this core characteristic, there are substantial phenomenological differences between VHs that have different aetiologies, such as those arising from neurological conditions, visual loss, or psychedelic compounds. Here, we examine the potential mechanistic basis of these differences by leveraging recent advances in visualising the learned representations of a coupled classifier and generative deep neural network - an approach we call  computational (neuro)phenomenology. Examining three aetiologically distinct populations in which VHs occur - neurological conditions (Parkinsons Disease and Lewy Body Dementia), visual loss (Charles Bonnet Syndrome, CBS), and psychedelics - we identify three dimensions relevant to distinguishing these classes of VHs: realism (veridicality), dependence on sensory input (spontaneity), and complexity. By selectively tuning the parameters of the visualisation algorithm to reflect influence along each of these phenomenological dimensions we were able to generate  synthetic VHs that were characteristic of the VHs experienced by each aetiology. We verified the validity of this approach experimentally in two studies that examined the phenomenology of VHs in neurological and CBS patients, and in people with recent psychedelic experience. These studies confirmed the existence of phenomenological differences across these three dimensions between groups, and crucially, found that the appropriate synthetic VHs were representative of each groups hallucinatory phenomenology. Together, our findings highlight the phenomenological diversity of VHs associated with distinct causal factors and demonstrate how a neural network model of visual phenomenology can successfully capture the distinctive visual characteristics of hallucinatory experience.",

Hereby, we conducted an fMRI and an EEG study to examine visual orthographic deficits in Chinese adults with RD. In the fMRI study, we found that there was reduced brain activation in the left inferior temporal gyrus and right cuneus gyrus in orthographic processing (lexical minus perceptual), but not in visual perceptual processing (perceptual minus null) in adults with RD, suggesting orthographic-specific deficits. In the EEG study, adults with RD showed typical visual binding as indicated by intermodulation SSVEPs (steady-state visual-evoked potentials) for both real and pseudo characters, suggesting normal neural phase locking in the visual modality. These results consistently suggest orthographic specific deficits but normal visual perceptual processing in adults with RD, deepening our understanding of the underlying deficits associated with RD.",

    "abstract": "A common point of failure in translation of preclinical neurological research to successful clinical trials comes in the giant leap from rodent models to humans. Non-human primates are phylogenetically close to humans, but cost and ethical considerations prohibit their widespread usage in preclinical trials. Swine have large, gyrencencephalic brains, which are biofidelic to human brains. Their classification as livestock makes them a readily accessible model organism. However, their size has precluded experiments involving intravital imaging with cellular resolution. Here, we present a suite of techniques and tools for in vivo imaging of porcine brains with subcellular resolution. Specifically, we describe surgical techniques for implanting a synthetic, flexible, transparent dural window for chronic optical access to the neocortex. We detail optimized parameters and methods for injecting adeno-associated virus vectors through the cranial imaging window to express fluorescent proteins. We introduce a large-animal 2-photon microscope that was constructed with off-the shelf components, has a gantry design capable of accommodating animals > 80 kg, and is equipped with a high-speed digitizer for digital fluorescence lifetime imaging. Finally, we delineate strategies developed to mitigate the substantial motion artifact that complicates high resolution imaging in large animals, including heartbeat-triggered high-speed image stack acquisition. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated in sample images acquired from pigs transduced with the chloride-sensitive fluorescent protein SuperClomeleon.",

    "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most burdensome psychiatric disorder characterized by remarkably heterogeneous clinical phenotypes. It remains challenging to delineate the heterogeneity of neurobiological abnormalities underlying the clinical variance and, on this basis, to identify neurophysiological subtypes of MDD patients. Here, using a large multisite resting-state functional MRI data from 1,148 MDD patients and 1,079 healthy controls, we generated lifespan normative models of functional connectivity strengths, mapped the heterogeneity of patients individual deviations, and identified neurobiological MDD subtypes. MDD patients showed positive deviations mainly in the default mode and subcortical areas, and negative deviations widely distributed over the cortex. However, there was a great inter-subject heterogeneity as indicated by that no more than 3.14% of patients deviated from the normative range for any brain region. Two neurophysiological MDD subtypes were identified. Subtype 1 showed severe deviations with positive deviations in the default mode, limbic, and subcortical areas, and negative deviations in the sensorimotor, dorsal and ventral attention areas, while subtype 2 showed a moderate but conversed deviation pattern. The severe-deviation subtype had older age, higher medicated proportion, and higher Suicide item score, while the moderate-deviation subtype showed higher Work and Activities and Depressed Mood item scores. Moreover, the baseline deviations in the severe-deviation subtype were predictive of 6-month antidepressant treatment effects in a subsample. To our knowledge, the current study is the largest multisite analysis of neurophysiological MDD subtyping to date and the findings shed light on our understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying the intersubject heterogeneity of clinical phenotypes, which are informative for the development of personalized treatments for this disorder.",

This study combined a placebo intervention on hunger with computational modelling and functional magnetic resonance imaging of value-based decision-making. The results show that prognostic beliefs about hunger shape hunger experiences, how much participants value food and food-value encoding in the prefrontal cortex. Computational modelling further revealed that these placebo effects were underpinned by how much and when during the decision process taste and health information are integrated into the accumulation of evidence toward a food choice. The drift weights of both sources of information further moderated ventromedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex interactions during choice formation. These findings provide novel insights into the neurocognitive mechanisms that translate higher order prognostic beliefs into non-aversive interoceptive sensitivity and shape decision-making.",

    "abstract": "KCNT1 encodes the sodium-activated potassium channel Slack (KCNT1, KNa1.1), an important mediator of neuronal membrane excitability. Gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in humans lead cortical network hyperexcitability and seizures, as well as very severe intellectual disability. Using a mouse model of Slack GOF-associated epilepsy, we found that both excitatory and inhibitory neurons of the cerebral cortex have increased Na+-dependent K+ (KNa) currents and voltage-dependent sodium (NaV) currents. The characteristics of the increased KNa currents were, however, different in the two cell types such that the intrinsic excitability of excitatory neurons was enhanced but that of inhibitory neurons was suppressed. We further showed that the expression of NaV channel subunits, particularly that of NaV1.6, is upregulated and that the length of the axon initial segment (AIS) and of axonal NaV immunostaining is increased in both neuron types. We found that the proximity of the AIS to the soma is shorter in excitatory neurons than in inhibitory neurons of the mutant animals, potentially contributing to the different effects on membrane excitability. Our study on the coordinate regulation of KNa currents and the expression of NaV channels may provide a new avenue for understanding and treating epilepsies and other neurological disorders.\n\nIn briefIn a genetic mouse model of Na+-activated K+ potassium channel gene Slack-related childhood epilepsy, Wu et al. show that a disease-causing gain-of-function (GOF) mutation R455H in Slack channel causes opposite effects on excitability of cortical excitatory and inhibitory neurons. In contrast to heterologous expression systems, they find that the increase in potassium current substantially alters the expression of sodium channel subunits, resulting in increased lengths of axonal initial segments.\n\nHighlightsGOF mutations in Slack potassium channel cause elevated outward K+currents and inward voltage-dependent Na+ (NaV) currents in cortical neurons\n\nSlack GOF does not alter the expression of Slack channel but upregulates the expression of NaV channel\n\nSlack GOF enhances the excitability of excitatory neurons but suppresses the firing of inhibitory interneurons\n\nSlack GOF alters the length of AIS in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons\n\nProximity of AIS to the soma is different between excitatory neuron and inhibitory neuron",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have revealed the production of time-locked blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) signals throughout the entire brain in response to a task, challenging the idea of sparse and localized brain functions, and highlighting the pervasiveness of potential false negative fMRI findings. In these studies,  whole-brain refers to gray matter regions only, which is the only tissue traditionally studied with fMRI. However, recent reports have also demonstrated reliable detection and analyses of BOLD signals in white matter which have been largely ignored in previous reports. Here, using model-free analysis and simple tasks, we investigate BOLD signal changes in both white and gray matters. We aimed to evaluate whether white matter also displays time-locked BOLD signals across all structural pathways in response to a stimulus. We find that both white and gray matter show time-locked activations across the whole-brain, with a majority of both tissue types showing statistically significant signal changes for all task stimuli investigated. We observed a wide range of signal responses to tasks, with different regions showing very different BOLD signal changes to the same task. Moreover, we find that each region may display different BOLD responses to different stimuli. Overall, we present compelling evidence that the whole brain, including both white and gray matter, show time-locked activation to multiple stimuli, not only challenging the idea of sparse functional localization, but also the prevailing wisdom of treating white matter BOLD signals as artefacts to be removed.",

    "abstract": "The critical brain hypothesis states that the brain can benefit from operating close to a second-order phase transition. While it has been shown that several computational aspects of sensory information processing (e. g., sensitivity to input) are optimal in this regime, it is still unclear whether these computational benefits of criticality can be leveraged by neural systems performing behaviorally relevant computations. To address this question, we investigate signatures of criticality in networks optimized to perform efficient encoding of stimuli. We consider a spike-coding network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with synaptic transmission delays and input noise. Previously, it was shown that the performance of such networks varies non-monotonically with the noise amplitude. Interestingly, we find that in the vicinity of the optimal noise level for efficient coding, the network dynamics exhibits signatures of criticality, namely, the distribution of avalanche sizes follows a power law. When the noise amplitude is too low or too high for efficient coding, the network appears either super-critical or sub-critical, respectively. Our work suggests that two influential, and previously disparate theories of neural processing optimization - efficient coding, and criticality - may be intimately related.",

    "abstract": "The last two decades of electrophysiological and neuroimaging research converged that the activity in the medial frontal cortex plays a pivotal role in cognitive control processes. Notably, the midfrontal theta (MFT) oscillatory EEG power, as well as activity in the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) or pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA), were consistently proclaimed as markers of conflict processing. However, these brain signals are strongly correlated with response time (RT) variability in various non-conflict tasks, which overshadows the true nature of their involvement. Our previous study (Beldzik et al., 2022) successfully identified these brain signals during a simultaneous EEG-fMRI experiment implementing Stroop and Simon tasks. Based on the assumption that overcoming the habitual prepotent response during high interference trials require additional neural resources beyond simple decision variable represented in RTs, here we aim to verify if these markers exhibit a congruency effect beyond RT variations. Furthermore, we explored if these brain signals represent either proactive or reactive cognitive control mechanisms by investigating two widely known behavioral phenomena observed in conflict tasks: proportion congruency and congruency sequence effects. The results revealed partially null findings for MFT activity, yet a distinct cognitive control specialization between aMCC and preSMA. Our study provides novel evidence that the former is involved in proactive control mechanisms, possibly contingency learning, whereas the latter reflects reactive control mechanisms by exhibiting a strong congruency effect regardless of RT variation and responding to adaptive behavior.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 causes a clinical spectrum of acute and chronic illness and host / virus interactions are not completely understood1,2. To identify host factors that can influence SARS-CoV-2 infection, we screened the human genome for genes that, when upregulated, alter the outcome of authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection. From this, we identify 34 new genes that can alter the course of infection, including the innate immune receptor P-selectin, which we show is a novel SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor. At the cellular level expression of P-selectin does not confer tropism for SARS-CoV-2, instead it acts to suppress infection. More broadly, P-selectin can also promote binding to SARS-CoV-2 variants, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS, acting as a general spike receptor for highly pathogenic coronaviruses. P-selectin is expressed on platelets and endothelium3, and we confirm SARS-CoV-2 spike interactions with these cells are P-selectin-dependent and can occur under shear flow conditions. In vivo, authentic SARS-CoV-2 uses P-selectin to home to airway capillary beds where the virus interacts with the endothelium and platelets, and blocking this interaction can clear vascular-associated SARS-CoV-2 from the lung. Together we show for the first time that coronaviruses can use the leukocyte recruitment system to control tissue localization, and this fundamental insight may help us understand and control highly pathogenic coronavirus disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a major cell entry receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Induction of ACE2 expression may represent an effective tactic employed by SARS-CoV-2 to facilitate its own propagation. However, the regulatory mechanisms of ACE2 expression after viral infection remain largely unknown. By employing an array of 45 different luciferase reporters, we identify that the transcription factor Sp1 positively and HNF4 negatively regulate the expression of ACE2 at the transcriptional levels in HPAEpiC cells, a human lung epithelial cell line. SARS-CoV-2 infection promotes and inhibits the transcription activity of Sp1 and HNF4, respectively. The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is activated by SARS-CoV-2 infection, is a crucial node for induction of ACE2 expression by increasing Sp1 phosphorylation, an indicator of its activity, and reducing HNF4 nuclear location. Furthermore, we show that colchicine could inhibit the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, thereby suppressing ACE2 expression. Inhibition of Sp1 by either its inhibitor mithramycin A or colchicine reduces viral replication and tissue injury in Syrian hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2. In summary, our study uncovers a novel function of Sp1 in regulating ACE2 expression and suggests that Sp1 is a potential target to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Here, we report transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility data for all known cell types in the developing eye. Photoreceptors appear as streams of cells that represent dynamic developmental timelines. Photoreceptor subtypes are transcriptionally distinct when they begin to differentiate, but then converge upon a common transcriptome just 24 hours later. We identify novel cell type-specific marker genes, enhancers and potential regulators, as well as genes with distinct R3 or R4 photoreceptor specific expression. Finally, we observe that photoreceptor chromatin accessibility is more permissive than non-neuronal lens-secreting cone cells, which show a more restrictive chromatin profile. This single cell genomics atlas will greatly empower the Drosophila eye as a model system.",

    "abstract": "Goal-directed behavior paradigms inevitably involve temporal processes, such as anticipation, expectation, timing, waiting, and withholding. And yet, amongst the vast use of object-based task paradigms, characterizations of temporal features are often neglected. Here, we longitudinally analyzed mice from naive to expert performance in a somatosensory selective detection task. In addition to tracking standard measures from signal detection theory, we also characterized learning of temporal features. We find that mice transition from general sampling strategies to stimulus detection and stimulus discrimination. During these transitions, mice learn to wait as they anticipate an expected stimulus presentation and to time their response after a stimulus presentation. By establishing and implementing standardized measures, we show that the development of waiting and timing in the task overlaps with learning of stimulus detection and discrimination. We also investigated sex differences in temporal and object-based trajectories of learning, finding that males learn strategies idiosyncratically and that females learn strategies more sequentially and stereotypically. Overall, our findings emphasize multiple temporal strategies in learning for an object-based task and highlight the importance of considering diverse temporal and object-based features when characterizing behavioral and neuronal aspects of learning.",

Here we used the holdup assay to proteome-wide measure steady-state affinity constants of BIN1 SH3 domain for thousands of full-length cellular proteins, as well as for hundreds of putative SH3-binding sites found within the identified BIN1 partners. Besides confirming known partners, such as dynamin 2 (DNM2), we also identified and affinity-characterized numerous others, like SMCHD1, which were previously implicated in different neuromuscular disorders. We also assessed the impact of a set of rare natural BIN1 SH3 domain variants on affinity interactomes and identified potentially harmful ones that exhibited perturbed affinity profiles, whose impacts were confirmed in a cellular assay for BIN1-mediated membrane remodeling, tentatively connecting them to neuromuscular disorders. In the study, we develop a new affinity-interactomic strategy, which can be generally applied to study the consequences of disease-associated genomic variants of any kind.",

Further, this work shows how membrane receptor guanylyl cyclases hijack the regulatory mechanisms used for active kinases to facilitate their regulation.

    "abstract": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are common first-line treatments for major depression. However, a significant number of depressed patients do not respond adequately to these pharmacological treatments. In the present preclinical study, we demonstrate that organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), an atypical monoamine transporter, contributes to the effects of SSRI by regulating the routing of the essential amino acid tryptophan to the brain. Contrarily to wild-type mice, OCT2-invalidated mice failed to respond to prolonged fluoxetine treatment in a chronic depression model induced by corticosterone exposure recapitulating core symptoms of depression, i.e., anhedonia, social withdrawal, anxiety, and memory impairment. After corticosterone and fluoxetine treatment, the levels of tryptophan and its metabolites serotonin and kynurenine were decreased in the brain of OCT2 mutant mice compared to wild-type mice and reciprocally tryptophan and kynurenine levels were increased in mutants plasma. OCT2 was detected by immunofluorescence in several structures at the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or brain-CSF interface. Tryptophan supplementation during fluoxetine treatment increased brain concentrations of tryptophan in wild-type and OCT2 mutant mice, yet more efficiently in WT than in mutants, while discretely increasing 5-HT concentrations. Importantly, tryptophan supplementation improved the sensitivity to fluoxetine treatment of OCT2 mutant mice, impacting chiefly anhedonia and short-term memory. Western blot analysis showed that glycogen synthase kinase-3{beta} (GSK3{beta}) and mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) intracellular signaling was impaired in OCT2 mutant mice brain after corticosterone and fluoxetine treatment and, conversely, tryptophan supplementation recruited selectively the mTOR protein complex 2. This study provides the first evidence of the physiological relevance of OCT2-mediated tryptophan transport, and its biological consequences on serotonin homeostasis in the brain and SSRI efficacy.",

By selectively isolating exosomes using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and employing cell-type specific exosome reporter mice, our current results define a secreted astroglial exosome pathway that can spread long-range in vivo and stimulate axon growth of cortical pyramidal neurons. Subsequent biochemical and genetic studies found that surface expression of glial HepaCAM protein essentially and sufficiently mediates the axon-stimulating effect of astroglial exosomes. Interestingly, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a major astroglia-secreted cholesterol carrier to promote synaptogenesis, strongly inhibits the stimulatory effect of astroglial exosomes on axon growth. Developmental ApoE deficiency also significantly reduces spine density of cortical pyramidal neurons. Together, our study suggests a surface contact mechanism of astroglial exosomes in regulating axon growth and its antagonization by ApoE, which collectively coordinates early postnatal pyramidal neuronal axon growth and dendritic spine formation.",

    "abstract": "Microglia, the innate immune cells of the brain, are activated by damage or disease. In mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), microglia shift from neurotrophic to neurotoxic states with disease progression. It remains unclear how human microglia change relative to the TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) aggregation that occurs in 97% of ALS cases. Here we examine spatial relationships between microglial activation and TDP-43 pathology in brain tissue from people with ALS and from a TDP-43-driven ALS mouse model. Post-mortem human brain tissue from the Neurological Foundation Human Brain Bank was obtained from 10 control and 10 ALS cases in parallel with brain tissue from a bigenic NFFH-tTA/tetO-hTDP-43{Delta}NLS (rNLS) mouse model of ALS at disease onset, early disease, and late disease stages. The spatiotemporal relationship between microglial activation and ALS pathology was determined by investigating microglial functional marker expression in brain regions with low and high TDP-43 burden at end-stage human disease: hippocampus and motor cortex, respectively. Sections were immunohistochemically labelled with a two-round multiplexed antibody panel against; microglial functional markers (L-ferritin, HLA-DR, CD74, CD68, and Iba1), a neuronal marker (NeuN), an astrocyte marker (GFAP), and pathological phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43). Single-cell levels of microglial functional markers were quantified using custom analysis pipelines and mapped to anatomical regions and ALS pathology. We identified a significant increase in microglial Iba1 and CD68 expression in the human ALS motor cortex, with microglial CD68 being significantly correlated with pTDP-43 pathology load. We also identified two subpopulations of microglia enriched in the ALS motor cortex that were defined by high L-ferritin expression. A similar pattern of microglial changes was observed in the rNLS mouse, with an increase first in CD68 and then in L-ferritin expression, with both occurring only after pTDP-43 inclusions were detectable. Our data strongly suggest that microglia are phagocytic at early-stage ALS but transition to a dysfunctional state at end-stage disease, and that these functional states are driven by pTDP-43 aggregation. Overall, these findings enhance our understanding of microglial phenotypes and function in ALS.",

    "abstract": "Seed-borne microorganisms can be pioneer taxa during germination and seedling emergence. Still, the identity and phenotypic effects of these taxa that constitute a primary inoculum of plant microbiota is mostly unknown. Here, we studied the transmission of bacteria from radish seeds to seedlings using the inoculation of individual seed-borne strains and synthetic communities (SynComs) under in vitro conditions. The SynComs were composed of highly abundant and prevalent, sub-dominant or rare bacterial seed taxa. We monitored the transmission of each strain alone or in communities using gyrB gene amplicon sequencing and assessed their impacts on germination and seedling phenotype.\n\nAll strains and SynComs successfully colonized seedlings and we were able to reconstruct a richness gradient (6, 8 and 12 strains) on both seeds and seedlings. Stenotrophomonas rhizophila became dominant on seedlings of the three SynComs but most strains had variable transmission success (i.e increasing, stable or decreasing during seed to seedling transition) that also depended on the SynCom richness.\n\nSome seed-borne strains (Pseudomonas viridiflava, Paenibacillus sp) had detrimental effects on germination and seedling development. Abnormal seedling morphologies were also observed with SynComs but their proportions decreased at the highest richness level. Interestingly, some bacterial strains previously identified as core taxa of radish seeds (Pseudomonas viridiflava, Erwinia persicina) were associated with detrimental effects on seedling phenotypes either in isolation or in SynComs. These results confirm that the plant core microbiome includes pathogenic and not only commensal or mutualistic taxa.\n\nAltogether, these results show that SynCom inoculation can effectively manipulate seed and seedling microbiota diversity and modulate plant phenotypes. This study also highlights strong differences between native seed-borne taxa in the colonization and survival on these plant habitats.",

Although the differentiated (heterocyst) and undifferentiated cells (vegetative cells) were distinguished by their cellular shapes, we found that their internal states, that is, microbial pigment compositions, were distinguished by using a Raman microscope. Almost of Raman bands of the cellular components were assigned to vibrations of the pigments; chlorophyll a, {beta}-carotene, phycocyanin, and allophycocyanin. We found that the Raman spectral measurement can detect the decomposition of both phycocyanin and allophycocyanin, which are components of the light-harvesting phycobilisome complex in the photosystem II. We observed that the Raman bands of phycocyanin and allophycocyanin exhibited more remarkable decrease in the heterocysts when compared to those of chlorophyll a and {beta}-carotene. This result indicated the prior decomposition of phycobilisome in the heterocysts. Moreover, the Raman bands of allophycocyanin were more decreased in heterocysts when compared to those of phycocyanin, suggesting that the decomposition of phycocyanin was more strongly suppressed than allophycocyanin in heterocysts.

    "abstract": "Methanothrix is widely distributed in natural and artificial anoxic environments and plays a major role in global methane emissions. It is one of only two genera that can form methane from acetate dismutation and through participation in direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) with exoelectrogens. Although Methanothrix is a significant member of many methanogenic communities, little is known about its physiology. In this study, transcriptomics helped to identify potential routes of electron transfer during DIET between Geobacter metallireducens and Methanothrix thermoacetophila. Additions of magnetite to cultures significantly enhanced growth by acetoclastic methanogenesis and by DIET, while granular activated carbon (GAC) amendments impaired growth. Transcriptomics suggested that the OmaF-OmbF-OmcF porin complex and the octaheme outer membrane c-type cytochrome, Gmet_0930, were important for electron transport across the outer membrane of G. metallireducens during DIET with Mx. thermoacetophila. Clear differences in the metabolism of Mx. thermoacetophila when grown via DIET or acetate dismutation were not apparent. However, genes coding for proteins involved in carbon fixation and a surface associated quinoprotein, SqpA, were highly expressed in all conditions. Expression of gas vesicle genes was significantly lower in DIET-than acetate-grown cells, possibly to facilitate better contact between membrane associated redox proteins during DIET. These studies reveal potential electron transfer mechanisms utilized by both Geobacter and Methanothrix during DIET and provide important insights into the physiology of Methanothrix in anoxic environments.\n\nImportanceMethanothrix is a significant methane producer in a variety of methanogenic environments including soils and sediments as well as anaerobic digesters. Its abundance in these anoxic environments has mostly been attributed to its high affinity for acetate and its ability to grow by acetoclastic methanogenesis. However, Methanothrix species can also generate methane by directly accepting electrons from exoelectrogenic bacteria through direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET). Methane production through DIET is likely to further increase their contribution to methane production in natural and artificial environments. Therefore, acquiring a better understanding of DIET with Methanothrix will help shedding light on ways to 1) minimize microbial methane production in natural terrestrial environments and 2) maximize biogas formation by anaerobic digesters treating waste.",

    "abstract": "During early ontogeny, microbiome affects development of the gastrointestinal tract, immunity and survival in vertebrates. Bird egg has been suggested to be either (1) initially sterile (Sterile egg hypothesis) and (2) colonized through horizontal trans-shell migration after egg laying, or (3) initially seeded with bacteria through vertical transfer from mother ss oviduct. Little empirical data illuminate so far the contribution of these mechanisms to gut microbiota formation in avian embryos. We evaluated microbiome of the egg content (day 0; E0-egg), embryonic gut at day 13 (E13) and female faeces in a free-living passerine, the great tit (Parus major), using a methodologically advanced procedure combining 16S rRNA gene sequencing and microbe-specific qPCR assays. Our metabarcoding revealed that avian egg is (nearly) sterile, barely distinguishable in microbial composition from negative controls. Of the three potentially pathogenic bacteria targeted by qPCR, only Dietzia was found in E0-egg (yet also in controls), E13 gut and female samples, which might indicate its possible vertical transfer. Unlike in poultry, we have shown in passerines that major bacterial colonisation of the gut does not occur before chicks hatching. We stress that protocols carefully checking for environmental contamination are critically important in studies using samples with low bacterial biomass.",

    "abstract": "Efficient transmission of herpesviruses is essential for dissemination in host populations; however, little is known about the viral genes that mediate transmission, mostly due to their close relationship to their natural host. Mareks disease is a devastating herpesviral disease of chickens caused by Mareks disease virus (MDV) and an excellent natural model to study skin- tropic herpesviruses and transmission. Similar to varicella zoster virus that causes chicken pox in humans, the only site where fully productive replication occurs is in epithelial skin cells and this is required for host to host transmission. Here, we enriched for actively replicating virus in feather follicle epithelial skin cells of live chickens to measure both viral transcription and protein expression using combined RNA sequencing and LC/MS-MS bottom-up proteomics. Enrichment produced a previously unseen breadth and depth of viral peptide sequencing. We confirmed protein translation for 84 viral genes at high confidence (1% FDR) and correlated relative protein abundance with RNA expression levels. Using a proteogenomic approach, we confirmed translation of most well-characterized spliced viral transcripts and identified a novel, abundant isoform of the 14 kDa transcript family via both intron-spanning sequencing reads as well as a high-quality junction-spanning peptide identification. We identified peptides representing alternative start codon usage in several genes and putative novel microORFs at the 5 ends of two core herpesviral genes, pUL47 and ICP4, along with evidence of transcription and translation of the capsid scaffold protein pUL26.5. Using a natural animal host model system to examine viral gene expression provides a robust, efficient, and meaningful way of validating results gathered from cell culture systems.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn the natural host, the transcriptome and proteome of many herpesviruses are poorly defined. Here, we evaluated the viral transcriptome and proteome in feather follicle epithelial skin cells of chickens infected with Mareks disease virus (MDV), an important poultry pathogen as well as an excellent model for skin-tropic human alphaherpesvirus replication in skin cells. Using fluorescently tagged virus, we significantly enriched the number of infected cells sampled from live chickens, greatly enhancing the detection of viral transcripts and proteins within a host background. Based on this, we could confirm the translation of most transcripts using deep MS/MS-based proteomics and identify novel expressed peptides supportive of an increasingly complex translational and regulatory viral landscape. The demonstrated deep peptide sequencing capability can serve as a template for future work in herpesviral proteomics.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is an intracellular pathogen that survives and grows in macrophages. A mechanism used by Mtb to achieve intracellular survival is to secrete effector molecules that arrest the normal process of phagosome maturation. Through phagosome maturation arrest (PMA), Mtb remains in an early phagosome and avoids delivery to degradative phagolysosomes. One PMA effector of Mtb is the secreted SapM phosphatase. Because the host target of SapM, phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P), is located on the cytosolic face of the phagosome, SapM needs to be both released by the mycobacteria and escape the phagosome to carry out its function. To date, the only mechanism known for Mtb molecules to escape the phagosome is phagosome permeabilization by the ESX-1 secretion system. To understand this step of SapM function in PMA, we generated identical in-frame sapM mutants in both the attenuated Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine strain, which lacks the ESX-1 system, and Mtb. Characterization of these mutants demonstrated that SapM is required for PMA in both BCG and Mtb. Further, by establishing a role for SapM in PMA in BCG, and subsequently in a Mtb mutant lacking the ESX-1 system, we demonstrated that the role of SapM is ESX-1-independent. We further determined that ESX-2 or ESX-4 are also not required for SapM to function in PMA. These results indicate that SapM is a secreted effector of PMA in both BCG and Mtb and that it functions independent of the known mechanism for Mtb molecules to escape the phagosome.",

    "abstract": "Horseshoe bats are the natural hosts of the Sarbecovirus subgenus that includes SARS-CoV-1 and 2. Despite the devastating impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is still little known about the underlying epidemiology and virology of sarbecoviruses in their natural hosts, leaving large gaps in our pandemic preparedness. Here we describe the results of PCR testing for sarbecoviruses in the two horseshoe bat species (Rhinolophus hipposideros and R. ferrumequinum) present in Great Britain, collected in 2021-22 during the peak of COVID-19 pandemic. One hundred and ninety seven R. hipposideros samples from 33 roost sites and 277 R. ferremequinum samples from 20 roost sites were tested. No coronaviruses were detected in any samples from R. ferrumequinum whereas 44% and 56% of individual and pooled (respectively) faecal samples from R. hipposideros across multiple roost sites tested positive in a sarbecovirus-specific qPCR. Full genome sequences were generated from three of the positive samples (and partial genomes from two more) using Illumina RNAseq on unenriched samples. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the obtained sequences belong to the same monophyletic clade, with >95% similarity, as previously reported European isolates from R. hipposideros. The sequences differed in the presence or absence of accessory genes ORF 7b, 9b and 10. All lacked the furin cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 spike gene and are therefore unlikely to be infective for humans. These results demonstrate a lack, or at least low incidence, of SARS-CoV-2 spill over from humans to susceptible GB bats, and confirm that sarbecovirus infection is widespread in R. hipposideros. Despite frequently sharing roost sites with R. ferrumequinum, no evidence of cross-species transmission was found.",

    "abstract": "Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a prevalent cause of severe respiratory infections in children and the elderly. The viral genome, enwrapped by the nucleoprotein N into a helical nucleocapsid (NC), is a template for the viral RNA synthesis and a scaffold for the virion assembly. Although the structures of NC filaments representative of the other major families of the Mononegavirales order have been solved, a detailed understanding of the RSV NCs is missing. This cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis highlights the polymorphism of the RSV nucleocapsid-like assemblies. We reveal in particular the non-canonical arrangement of the RSV NC helix, composed of 16 N per asymmetric unit, and the resulting systematic variations in the RNA accessibility. We demonstrate that this unique helical symmetry originates from recurring longitudinal interactions by the C-terminal arm of the RSV N, whose truncation abrogates the inter-turn contacts. We report the cryo-EM structures of the full-length helical NC filaments, double-headed NCs, ring-capped NCs and double-decameric N-RNA rings, as well as those of the alternative assemblies formed by a C-terminally truncated N mutant. In addition, we demonstrate the functional importance of the interface involved in the formation of the double-headed and the ring-capped interactions.

    "abstract": "Plastic pollution is a serious global problem, with more than 12 million tonnes of plastic waste entering the oceans every year. Plastic debris can have considerable impacts on microbial community structure and functions in marine environments, and has been associated with an enrichment in pathogenic bacteria and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes. However, our understanding of these impacts is largely restricted to microbial assemblages on plastic surfaces. It is therefore unclear whether these effects are driven by the surface properties of plastics, providing an additional niche for certain microbes residing in biofilms, and/or chemicals leached from plastics, the effects of which could extend to surrounding planktonic bacteria. Here, we examine the effects of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic leachate exposure on the relative abundance of genes associated with bacterial pathogenicity and AMR within a seawater microcosm community. We show that PVC leachate, in the absence of plastic surfaces, drives an enrichment in AMR and virulence genes. In particular, leachate exposure significantly enriches AMR genes that confer multidrug, aminoglycoside and peptide antibiotic resistance. Additionally, enrichment of genes involved in the extracellular secretion of virulence proteins was observed among pathogens of marine organisms. This study provides the first evidence that chemicals leached from plastic particles alone can enrich genes related to microbial pathogenesis within a bacterial community, expanding our knowledge of the environmental impacts of plastic pollution with potential consequences for human and ecosystem health.",

    "abstract": "The oncolytic autonomous parvovirus Minute Virus of Mice (MVM) establishes infection in the nuclear environment by usurping host DNA Damage Response (DDRs) in the vicinity of cellular DNA break sites. MVM replication induces a global cellular DDR that is dependent on signaling by the ATM kinase and inactivates the cellular ATR-kinase pathway. However, the mechanism of how MVM generates cellular DNA breaks remains unknown. Using single molecule DNA Fiber Analysis, we have discovered that MVM infection leads to a shortening of host replication forks as infection progresses, as well as induction of replication stress prior to the initiation of virus replication. Ectopically expressed viral non-structural proteins NS1 and NS2 are sufficient to cause host-cell replication stress, as is the presence of UV-inactivated non-replicative MVM genomes. The host single-stranded DNA binding protein Replication Protein A (RPA) associates with the UV-inactivated MVM genomes, suggesting MVM genomes might serve as a sink for cellular stores of RPA. Overexpressing RPA in host cells prior to UV-MVM infection rescues DNA fiber lengths and increases MVM replication, confirming that MVM genomes deplete RPA stores to cause replication stress. Together, these results indicate that the presence of ssDNA in the nucleus generated by MVM genomes and viral proteins induces replication stress in the host cell through RPA exhaustion, rendering the host genome vulnerable to additional DNA breaks.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYParvoviruses are used in the clinic to design recombinant gene therapy vectors and as oncolytic agents. The autonomous parvovirus MVM utilizes the host cells DNA damage response machinery to replicate in host cells and cause additional DNA breaks. However, the mechanism of MVM-induced DNA damage remains unknown. We have discovered that MVM sequesters the host DNA repair protein RPA, which normally associates with single stranded DNA in the nucleus, rendering the host genome susceptible to replication stress.

    "abstract": "Bacteria can rapidly tune their physiology and metabolism to adapt to environmental fluctuations. In particular, they can adapt their lifestyle to the close proximity of other bacteria or presence of different surfaces. However, whether these interactions trigger transcriptomic responses is poorly understood. We used a specific set up of E. coli strains expressing native or synthetic adhesins mediating bacterial aggregation to study the transcriptomic changes of aggregated compared to non-aggregated bacteria. Our results show that following aggregation, bacteria exhibit a core response independent of the adhesin type, with differential expression of 56.9% of the coding genome, including genes involved in stress response and anaerobic lifestyle. Moreover, when aggregates were formed via a naturally expressed E. coli adhesin (Antigen 43), the transcriptomic response of the bacteria was more exaggerated compared to aggregates formed via a synthetic adhesin. This suggests that the response to aggregation induced by native E. coli adhesins could have been finely tuned during bacterial evolution. Our study therefore provides insights on the effect of self-interaction in bacteria and allows a better understanding of why bacterial aggregates exhibit increased stress tolerance.\n\nImportanceFormation of bacterial aggregates has an important role in both clinical and ecological contexts. Although these structures have been previously shown to be more resistant to stressful conditions, the genetic basis of this stress tolerance associated with the aggregate lifestyle is poorly understood. Surface sensing mediated by different adhesins can result in varying changes on bacterial physiology. However, whether adhesin-adhesin interactions as well as the type of adhesin mediating aggregation affects bacterial cell physiology is unknown. By sequencing the transcriptomes of aggregated and non-aggregated cells expressing native or synthetic adhesins, we characterized the effects of aggregation and adhesin type on E. coli physiology.",

Optimal growth occurred at 25 - 30 {degrees}C, within a salinity range of 2 - 6% sea salt, and a pH range between 5 - 8. The major fatty acids identified were C17:0 3-OH, iso-C15:0, and iso-C15:1 G. The DNA G+C content of strain Hal144T was 41.4 mol%. Based on the polyphasic approach, strain Hal144T represents a novel species of the genus Maribacter, and we propose the name Maribacter halichondris sp. nov.. The type strain is Hal144T (= DSM 114563T = LMG 32744T).",

    "abstract": "Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) represent a new therapeutic modality involving selectively directing disease-causing proteins for degradation through proteolytic systems. Our ability to exploit this targeted protein degradation (TPD) approach for antibiotic development remains nascent due to our limited understanding of which bacterial proteins will be labile TPD targets. Here, we use a genetic system to model chemically-induced proximity and degradation to screen essential proteins in Mycobacterium smegmatis (Msm), a model for the major human pathogen M. tuberculosis (Mtb). We find that drug-induced proximity to the bacterial ClpC1P1P2 proteolytic complex is sufficient to degrade many, but not all, endogenous Msm proteins, profoundly inhibiting bacterial growth for some targets. We also show that TPD can potentiate the effects of existing antibiotics targeting the same pathways and complexes. Together, our results identify specific endogenous mycobacterial proteins as attractive targets for future Mtb PROTAC development, as both standalone antibiotics and potentiators of existing antibiotic efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV), a member of the Capripoxvirus genus, causes substantial economic losses in the livestock industry and is rapidly spreading among various LSDV-free countries across the globe. Viral infections are known to alter the cellular miRNA expression profile of the host significantly.Besides being important biomarker candidates, circulating miRNAs have a significant role in controlling viral infection and antiviral immune responses, including several molecular mechanisms. miR-3959-3p, a significantly downregulated miRNA revealed in RNA-sequencing results of LSDV-infected LT cells, was selected to bedetected in the serum of LSDV-infected and uninfected cattle sera (40 LSDV-infected and 40 LSDV-uninfected). We optimized quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) for quantitative determination of miR-3959-3p in the bovine sera samples. The level of miR-3959-3p appears to be towards lower side in the LSDV-infected as compared to the uninfected animals. However, no significant correlation could be established between the two groups due to fluctuations in the miRNA levels in both groups. This is the first report on the detection of circulating miRNA in LSDV-infected cattle sera.The dysregulation pattern of miR-3959-3p appears to suggest that several other miRNAs need to be explored and may serve as biomarkers for LSDV infection. However, this needs further investigation by screening several other miRNAs and on large number of LSDV positive and negative animals.\n\nAuthor summaryMicroRNAs are the key regulators of viral infections. However, in LSDVinfection the miRNA response is greatly unknown.\n\nIn this study, miRNA expression in Vero cell linepost LSDV infection was studied for the first time.\n\nOne of the miRNAs identified in the RNA-sequencing results i.emiR-3959-3p, was shown to be downregulated LSDV infection.

    "abstract": "Forces generated by actin assembly assist membrane invagination during clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). The sequential recruitment of core endocytic proteins and regulatory proteins, and assembly of the actin network, are well documented in live cells and are highly conserved from yeasts to humans. However, understanding of CME protein self-organization, as well as the biochemical and mechanical principles that underlie actins role in CME, is lacking. Here, we show that supported lipid bilayers coated with purified yeast WASP, an endocytic actin assembly regulator, and incubated in cytoplasmic yeast extracts, recruit downstream endocytic proteins and assemble actin tails. Time-lapse imaging of WASP-coated bilayers revealed sequential recruitment of proteins from different endocytic modules, faithfully replicating in vivo behavior. Reconstituted actin networks assemble in a WASP-dependent manner and deform lipid bilayers, as seen by electron microscopy. Time-lapse imaging revealed that vesicles are released from the lipid bilayers with a burst of actin assembly. Actin networks pushing on membranes have previously been reconstituted; here, we have reconstituted a biologically important variation of these actin networks that self-organize on bilayers and produce pulling forces sufficient to bud off membrane vesicles. We propose that actin-driven vesicle generation may represent an ancient evolutionary precursor to diverse vesicle forming processes adapted for a wide array of cellular environments and applications.\n\nSignificance StatementActin filament assembly participates in many vesicle-forming processes. However, the underlying principles for how assembly is initiated and organized to effectively harness assembly forces remain elusive. To address this gap, we report a novel reconstitution of actin-driven vesicle release from supported lipid bilayers. Using real-time imaging, we observe sequential recruitment of endocytic proteins and, following a burst of actin assembly, vesicle release from bilayers. Given the absence of cargo or upstream endocytic regulatory proteins on the bilayers, and the participation of actin in many vesicle-forming processes, we posit that this mode of vesicle formation represents an early evolutionary precursor for multiple trafficking pathways. We expect that this assay will be of great use for future investigations of actin-mediated vesicle-forming processes.",

    "abstract": "The re-use of old genetic variation can promote rapid diversification in evolutionary radiations, but in most cases, the historical events underlying this divergence are not known. For example, ancient hybridization can generate new combinations of alleles that sort into descendant lineages, potentially providing the raw material to initiate divergence. In the Mimulus aurantiacus species complex, there is evidence for widespread gene flow among members of this radiation. In addition, allelic variation in the MaMyb2 gene is responsible for differences in flower color between the closely related ecotypes of subspecies puniceus, contributing to reproductive isolation by pollinators. Previous work suggested that MaMyb2 was introgressed into the red-flowered ecotype of puniceus. However, additional taxa within the radiation have independently evolved red flowers from their yellow-flowered ancestors, raising the possibility that this introgression had a more ancient origin. In this study, we used repeated tests of admixture from whole-genome sequence data across this diverse radiation to demonstrate that there has been both ancient and recurrent hybridization in this group. However, most of the signal of this ancient introgression has been removed due to selection, suggesting that widespread barriers to gene flow are in place between taxa. Yet, a roughly 30 kb region that contains the MaMyb2 gene is currently shared among the red-flowered taxa. Patterns of admixture, sequence divergence, and extended haplotype homozygosity across this region confirm a history of ancient hybridization, where functional variants have been preserved due to positive selection in red-flowered taxa but lost in their yellow-flowered counterparts. The results of this study reveal that selection against gene flow can reduce genomic signatures of ancient hybridization, but that historical introgression can provide essential genetic variation that facilitates the repeated origins of phenotypic traits between lineages.",

    "abstract": "Targeted protein degradation is a drug modality represented by compounds that recruit a target to an E3 ubiquitin ligase to promote target ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Historically, the field distinguishes monovalent degraders from bifunctional degraders (PROTACs) that connect target and ligase via separate binding ligands joined via a linker1-4. Here, we elucidate the mechanism of action of a PROTAC-like degrader of the transcriptional coactivator BRD4, composed of a BRD4 ligand linked to a ligand for the E3 ligase CRL4DCAF15. Using orthogonal CRISPR/Cas9 screens we identify the degrader activity is independent of DCAF15, and relies on a different CRL4 substrate receptor, DCAF16. We demonstrate an intrinsic affinity between BRD4 and DCAF16, which is dependent on the tandem bromodomains of BRD4 and further increased by the degrader without physically engaging DCAF16 in isolation. Structural characterization of the resulting ternary complex reveals both BRD4 bromodomains are bivalently engaged in cis by the degrader and are bound to DCAF16 through several interfacial BRD4-DCAF16 and degrader-DCAF16 contacts. Our findings demonstrate that intramolecularly bridging domains can confer glue-type stabilization of intrinsic target-E3 interactions, and we propose this as a general strategy to modulate the surface topology of target proteins to nucleate co-opting of E3 ligases or other cellular effector proteins for effective proximity-based pharmacology.",

    "abstract": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are emerging targeted agents against cancer. Current studies of ADCs are performed on monolayer cultures which do not mimic the biophysical property of a tumour. Hence, in vitro models that can better predict the efficacy of ADCs in vivo are needed. In this study, we aim to optimise 3-dimentional cancer spheroid systems, which preserve the features of the tumour structure, to test the efficacy of two ADCs (T-DM1 and T-vcMMAE). Firstly, a set of reproducible spheroid models using epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines were established. Subsequently, phenotypic changes in spheroids were characterised upon ADC treatment. The penetration dynamics of ADCs into 3D tumour structure were also studied. Our data revealed that spheroids are less sensitive to ADCs compared to monolayer cultures. Interestingly, the small molecule component of ADCs-the cytotoxic payload-showed a similar decrease in efficacy in spheroids compared to monolayer cultures. Furthermore, we also gained new insight into ADC penetration dynamics and showed that ADCs can fully penetrate a tumour-like spheroid within 24h. The results suggest that although ADCs, as large molecule biological drugs, are likely to have slower penetration dynamics than small molecule compounds such as their cytotoxic payload, they could have comparable capability to kill cancer cells in 3D structures. This may be explained by the fact that multiple cytotoxic payloads are conjugated with each single antibody, which compensates the penetration deficiency of the large molecules. In conclusion, our work confirms that the tumour 3D structure could limit the therapeutic efficacy of ADCs. Nevertheless, optimising ADC design such as adjusting drug-to-antibody ratios could help to overcome this hurdle.",

    "abstract": "Improving the scalability of tissue imaging throughput with bright, coherent X-rays requires identifying and mitigating artifacts resulting from the interactions between X-rays and matter. At synchrotron sources, long-term imaging of soft tissues in solution can result in gas bubble formation or cavitation, which dramatically compromises image quality and integrity of the samples. By combining in-line phase-contrast cineradiography with operando gas chromatography, we were able to track the onset and evolution of high-energy X-ray-induced gas bubbles in ethanol-embedded soft tissue samples for tens of minutes (2 to 3 times the typical scan times). We demonstrate quantitatively that vacuum degassing of the sample during preparation can significantly delay bubble formation, offering up to a twofold improvement in dose tolerance, depending on the tissue type. However, once nucleated, bubble growth is faster in degassed than undegassed samples, indicating their distinct metastable states at bubble onset. Gas chromatography analysis shows increased solvent vaporization concurrent with bubble formation, yet the quantities of dissolved gases remain unchanged. Coupling features extracted from the radiographs with computational analysis of bubble characteristics, we uncover dose-controlled kinetics and nucleation site-specific growth. These hallmark signatures provide quantitative constraints on the driving mechanisms of bubble formation and growth. Overall, the observations highlight bubble formation as a critical, yet often overlooked hurdle in upscaling X-ray imaging for biological tissues and soft materials and we offer an empirical foundation for their understanding and imaging protocol optimization. More importantly, our approaches establish a top-down scheme to decipher the complex, multiscale radiation-matter interactions in these applications.\n\nSignificance statementBetter probing the X-ray radiation dose limit of bubble formation in biological tissue and developing mitigation methods is essential for improving imaging techniques involving X-ray, such as synchrotron X-ray tomography or crystallography. Here, we combined operando gas chromatography with in-line X-ray phase-contrast radiography on human lung and brain tissue to investigate bubble formation under high-energy X-ray irradiation. We demonstrate that vacuum degassing delays bubble nucleation up to a factor two, depending on the tissue type. Gas chromatography analysis showed increased solvent vaporization during bubble formation; however, the quantities of dissolved gases remained unchanged. Moreover, depending on the nucleation site, bubble growth can be geometrically constrained by sample microstructure, which influence its dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Anionic polysaccharides found in nature are functionally and structurally diverse, and so are the polysaccharide lyases (PLs) which catalyse their degradation. Atomic superposition of various PL folds according to their cleavable substrate structure confirm the occurrence of structural convergence at PL active sites. This suggests that various PL folds have emerged to cleave a particular class of anionic polysaccharide during the course of evolution. While structural and mechanistic similarity of PLs active site have been highlighted in earlier studies, a detailed understanding regarding functional properties of this catalytic convergence remains an open question, especially the role of extrinsic factors such as pH in the context of substrate binding and catalysis. Our earlier structural and functional work on pH directed multi-substrate specificity of Smlt1473 inspired us to regroup PLs according to substrate type to analyse the pH dependence of their catalytic activity. Interestingly, we find that particular groups of substrates are cleaved in a particular pH range (acidic/neutral/basic) irrespective of PLs fold, boosting the idea of functional convergence as well. Based on this observation, we set out to define structurally and computationally the key constituents of an active site among PL families. This study delineates the structural determinants of conserved  substrate-pH activity pairing within and between PL families.",

    "abstract": "The mechanistic link between the complex mutational landscape of de novo methyltransferase DNMT3A and the pathology of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has not been clearly elucidated so far. A recent discovery on the catalogue of DNMT3A-destabilizing mutations throughout the DNMT3A gene as well as the oligomerization-dependent catalytic property of DNMT3A prompted us to investigate the common effect of DNMT3A-destabilizing mutations (DNMT3AINS) on the genomewide methylation patterns of AML cells. In this study, we describe the characteristics of DNMT3AINS AML methylomes through the comprehensive computational analyses on three independent AML cohorts. As a result, we show that methylomes of DNMT3AINS AMLs are considerably different from those of DNMT3AR882 AMLs in that they exhibit both locally disordered DNA methylation states and increased across-cell DNA methylation heterogeneity in bivalent chromatin domains. This increased epigenetic heterogeneity was functionally associated with heterogeneous expression of membrane-associated factors shaping stem cell niche, implying the diversification of the modes of leukemic stem cell-niche interactions. We also present that the level of methylation disorder at bivalent domains predicts the response of AML cells to hypomethylating agents through cell line- and patient-level analyses, which supports that the survival of AML cells depends on stochastic DNA methylations at bivalent domains. Altogether, our work provides a novel mechanistic model suggesting the genomic origin of the aberrant epigenomic heterogeneity in disease conditions.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of ischemic stroke, which is a leading cause of death and long-term disability. Understanding the exact cellular signaling pathways that initiate and propagate neuroinflammation after stroke will be critical for developing immunomodulatory stroke therapies. In particular, the precise mechanisms of inflammatory signaling in the clinically relevant hyperacute period, hours after stroke, have not been elucidated. We used the RiboTag technique to obtain astrocyte and microglia-derived mRNA transcripts in a hyperacute (4 hours) and acute (3 days) period after stroke, as these two cell types are key modulators of acute neuroinflammation. Microglia initiated a rapid response to stroke at 4 hours by adopting an inflammatory profile associated with the recruitment of immune cells. The hyperacute astrocyte profile was marked by stress response genes and transcription factors, such as Fos and Jun, involved in pro-inflammatory pathways such as TNF-. By 3 days, microglia shift to a proliferative state and astrocytes strengthen their inflammatory response. The astrocyte pro-inflammatory response at 3 days is partially driven by the upregulation of the transcription factors C/EBP{beta}, Spi1, and Rel, which comprise 25% of upregulated transcription factor-target interactions. Surprisingly, few sex differences across all groups were observed. Expression and log2 fold data for all sequenced genes are available on a user-friendly website for researchers to examine gene changes and generate hypotheses for stroke targets. Taken together our data comprehensively describe the astrocyte and microglia-specific translatome response in the hyperacute and acute period after stroke and identify pathways critical for initiating neuroinflammation.",

In cell culture, pioneer transcription factors mediate \"reprogramming\" by opening new chromatin sites for expression that can attract transcription factors from the starting cells enhancers. Here we report that Sox4 is sufficient to initiate hepatobiliary metaplasia in the adult liver. In lineage-traced cells, we assessed the timing of Sox4-mediated opening of enhancer chromatin versus enhancer decommissioning. Initially, Sox4 directly binds to and closes hepatocyte regulatory sequences via a motif it overlaps with Hnf4a, a hepatocyte master regulator. Subsequently, Sox4 exerts pioneer factor activity to open biliary regulatory sequences. The results delineate a hierarchy by which gene networks become reprogrammed under physiological conditions, providing deeper insight into the basis for cell fate transitions in animals.",

Using established cell culture models of trophoblast differentiation, oxygen consumption rates and relative metabolite abundance were determined following 200 M (therapeutic range) and 2000 M (supra-therapeutic range) metformin treatment using Seahorse and mass-spectrometry approaches. While no differences in oxygen consumption rates or relative metabolite abundance were detected between vehicle and 200 M metformin treated cells, 2000 M metformin impaired oxidative metabolism and increased abundance of lactate and TCA cycle intermediates, -ketoglutarate, succinate, and malate. Examining differentiation, treatment with 2000 M, but not 200 M metformin, impaired HCG production and expression of multiple trophoblast differentiation markers. Overall, this work suggests that supra-therapeutic concentrations of metformin impairs trophoblast metabolism and differentiation whereas metformin concentrations in the therapeutic range do not strongly impact these processes.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic cells control inorganic phosphate to balance its role as essential macronutrient with its negative bioenergetic impact on reactions liberating phosphate. Phosphate homeostasis depends on the conserved INPHORS signaling pathway that utilizes inositol pyrophosphates (IPPs) and SPX receptor domains. Since cells synthesize various IPPs and SPX domains bind them promiscuously, it is unclear whether a specific IPP regulates SPX domains in vivo, or whether multiple IPPs act as a pool. In contrast to previous models, which postulated that phosphate starvation is signaled by increased production of the IPP 1-IP7, we now show that the levels of all detectable IPPs of yeast, 1-IP7, 5-IP7 and 1,5-IP8, strongly decline upon phosphate starvation. Among these, specifically the decline of 1,5-IP8 triggers the transcriptional phosphate starvation response, the PHO pathway. 1,5-IP8 inactivates the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Pho81 through its SPX domain. This stimulates the cyclin-dependent kinase Pho85-Pho80 to phosphorylate the transcription factor Pho4 and repress the PHO pathway. Combining our results with observations from other systems we propose a unified model where 1,5-IP8 signals cytosolic phosphate abundance to SPX proteins in fungi, plants, and mammals. Its absence triggers starvation responses.\n\nSignificance statementCytosolic Pi is of prime importance for cellular bioenergetics because Pi influences free energy of nucleotide hydrolysis and the metabolite fluxes through glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Eukaryotic cells use the INPHORS pathway to signal Pi via SPX domains and their ligands, inositol pyrophosphates (IP7, IP8), which control Pi homeostasis through a network of target proteins that import, export, store or detoxify Pi. Studies with different systems failed to yield a coherent model on this regulation.\n\nWe performed the first time-resolved profiling of the full isomer spectrum of inositol pyrophosphates in yeast and dissected the isomer that is relevant to intracellular Pi signaling. Our results can be combined with existing observations from plants, mammals, and other fungi to support a unified model of Pi signaling across all eukaryotic kingdoms, which is in accord with the fundamental importance of Pi management for metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the LMNA gene encoding nuclear lamins A/C cause a diverse array of tissue-selective diseases, with the heart being the most commonly affected organ. Despite progress in understanding the molecular perturbations emanating from LMNA mutations, an integrative understanding of the pathogenesis leading to cardiac dysfunction remains elusive. Using a novel cell-type specific Lmna deletion mouse model capable of translatome profiling, we found that cardiomyocyte-specific Lmna deletion in adult mice led to rapid cardiomyopathy with pathological remodeling. Prior to the onset of cardiac dysfunction, lamin A/C-depleted cardiomyocytes displayed nuclear envelope deterioration, golgi dilation/fragmentation, and CREB3-mediated golgi stress activation. Translatome profiling identified upregulation of Med25, a transcriptional co-factor that can selectively dampen UPR axes. Autophagy is disrupted in the hearts of these mice, which can be recapitulated by disrupting the golgi or inducing nuclear damage by increased matrix stiffness. Systemic administration of pharmacological modulators of autophagy or ER stress significantly improved the cardiac function. These studies support a hypothesis wherein stress responses emanating from the perinuclear space contribute to the development of LMNA cardiomyopathy.\n\nTeaserInterplay of stress responses underlying the development of LMNA cardiomyopathy",
