    "abstract": "Thiolutin is a well-known and long-used natural product transcription inhibitor with an unresolved mode of action. Recent studies have identified Zn2+-chelation activity for both thiolutin and the related dithiolopyrrolone holomycin, with direct inhibition of RNA polymerases ruled out as a mode of action. However, negative results for direct transcription inhibition of RNA polymerases in recent studies are contradicted by previously observed thiolutin inhibition of extract fractions containing yeast RNA Polymerases I, II, and III. Here, we present chemical genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the mode of action of thiolutin. We identify diverse classes of mutant that alter sensitivity to thiolutin. We functionally dissect the multidrug resistance and thioredoxin pathways controlling thiolutin sensitivity. We provide genetic evidence that thiolutin causes oxidation of thioredoxins in vivo and suggest that thiolutin both induces oxidative stress and alters Zn2+, Cu2+ and Mn2+ homeostasis in vivo, recapitulating previously observed thiolutin interactions with Zn2+. Finally, our results resolve contradictory biochemical results for thiolutin inhibition of transcription by direct demonstration of thiolutin inhibition of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in vitro. Inhibitory activity requires both appropriate reduction of thiolutin and the presence of Mn2+. Thio/Mn2+ inhibition is abrogated when template DNA is pre-bound to Pol II or when excess DTT is present, and renders Pol II pause prone in elongation if initiation is bypassed using a pre-formed Pol II elongation complex. Together, we propose that thiolutin directly inhibits Pol II transcription through a novel mechanism distinct from known transcription inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Flexible reward learning relies on frontal cortex, with substantial evidence indicating that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) subregions play important roles. Recent studies in both rat and macaque suggest theta oscillations (5-10 Hz) may be a spectral signature that coordinates this learning. However, network-level interactions between ACC and OFC in flexible learning remain unclear. We investigated the learning of stimulus-reward associations using a combination of simultaneous in-vivo electrophysiology in dorsal ACC and ventral OFC, partnered with bilateral inhibitory DREADDs in ACC. In freely-behaving male and female rats and using a within-subject design, we examined accuracy and speed of response across distinct and precisely-defined trial epochs during initial visual discrimination learning and subsequent reversal of stimulus-reward contingencies. Following ACC inhibition there was a propensity for random responding in early reversal learning, with correct vs. incorrect trials distinguished only from OFC, not ACC, theta power differences in the reversal phase. ACC inhibition also hastened incorrect choices during reversal. This same pattern of change in accuracy and speed was not observed in viral control animals. Thus, characteristics of impaired reversal learning following ACC inhibition are poor deliberation and weak theta signaling of accuracy in this region. The present results also point to OFC theta oscillations as a prominent feature of reversal learning, unperturbed by ACC inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Selection shapes genetic diversity around target mutations, yet little is known about how selection on specific loci affects the genetic trajectories of populations, including their genome-wide patterns of diversity and demographic responses. Here we study the patterns of genetic variation and geographic structure in a neotropical butterfly, Heliconius numata, and its closely related allies in the so-called melpomene-silvaniform clade. H. numata is known to have evolved an inversion supergene which controls variation in wing patterns involved in mimicry associations with distinct groups of co-mimics whereas it is associated to disassortative mate preferences and heterozygote advantage at this locus. We contrasted patterns of genetic diversity and structure 1) among extant polymorphic and monomorphic populations of H. numata, 2) between H. numata and its close relatives, and 3) between ancestral lineages. We show that H. numata populations which carry the inversions as a balanced polymorphism show markedly distinct patterns of diversity compared to all other taxa. They show the highest genetic diversity and effective population size estimates in the entire clade, as well as a low level of geographic structure and isolation by distance across the entire Amazon basin. By contrast, monomorphic populations of H. numata as well as its sister species and their ancestral lineages all show lower effective population sizes and genetic diversity, and higher levels of geographical structure across the continent. One hypothesis is that the large effective population size of polymorphic populations could be caused by the shift to a regime of balancing selection due to the genetic load and disassortative preferences associated with inversions. Testing this hypothesis with forward simulations supported the observation of increased diversity in populations with the supergene. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the formation of the supergene triggered a change in gene flow, causing a general increase in genetic diversity and the homogenisation of genomes at the continental scale.",

Building on previous work, we advance the modeling of the ear by presenting a complete, physiologically justified, bottom-up computer model based on up-to-date experimental data that integrates all of these parts together seamlessly. The detailed bottom-up design of the present model allows for the investigation of partial hearing mechanisms and their defects, including genetic, molecular, and microscopic factors. Also, thanks to the completeness of the model, one can study microscopic effects in the context of their implications on hearing as a whole, enabling the correlation with neural recordings and non-invasive psychoacoustic methods. Such a model is instrumental for advancing quantitative understanding of the mechanism of hearing, for investigating various forms of deafness, as well as for devising next generation hearing aids and cochlear implants.",

    "abstract": "The gradual accumulation of noisy evidence for or against options is the main step in the perceptual decision-making process. Using brain-wide electrophysiological recording in mice (Steinmetz et al., 2019), we examined neural correlates of evidence accumulation across brain areas. We demonstrated that the neurons with Drift-Diffusion-Model-like firing rate activity (i.e., evidence-sensitive ramping firing rate) were distributed across the brain. Exploring the underlying neural mechanism of evidence accumulation for the DDM-like neurons revealed different accumulation mechanisms (i.e. single and race) both within and across the brain areas. Our findings support the hypothesis that evidence accumulation is happening through multiple integration mechanisms in the brain. We further explored the timescale of the integration process in the single and race accumulator models. The results demonstrated that the accumulator microcircuits within each brain area had distinct properties in terms of their integration timescale, which were organized hierarchically across the brain. These findings support the existence of evidence accumulation over multiple timescales. Besides the variability of integration timescale across the brain, a heterogeneity of timescales was observed within each brain area as well. We demonstrated that this variability reflected the diversity of microcircuit parameters, such that accumulators with longer integration timescales had higher recurrent excitation strength.",

However, the lack of animal studies hinders a deeper mechanistic understanding of the cancer-promoting effects of ZEA. This study aimed to determine the effect of ZEA on colon cancer progression and its underlying mechanisms. Through integrative analyses of transcriptomics, metabolomics, metagenomics, and host phenotypes, we investigated the impact of a 4-week ZEA intervention on colorectal cancer in xenograft mice. Our results showed a twofold increase in tumor weight with the 4-week ZEA intervention. ZEA exposure significantly increased the mRNA and protein levels of BEST4, DGKB, and Ki67 and the phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 and AKT. Serum metabolomic analysis revealed that the levels of amino acids, including histidine, arginine, citrulline, and glycine, decreased significantly in the ZEA group. Furthermore, ZEA lowered the alpha diversity of the gut microbiota and reduced the abundance of nine genera, including Tuzzerella and Rikenella. Further association analysis indicated that Tuzzerella was negatively associated with the expression of BEST4 and DGKB genes, serum uric acid levels, and tumor weight. Additionally, circulatory hippuric acid levels positively correlated with tumor weight and the expression of oncogenic genes, including ROBO3, JAK3, and BEST4. Altogether, our results indicated that ZEA promotes colon cancer progression by enhancing the BEST4/AKT/ERK1/2 pathway, lowering circulatory amino acid concentrations, altering gut microbiota composition, and suppressing short chain fatty acids production.",

    "abstract": "Motivation: Recent advances in deep learning model development have enabled more accurate prediction of drug response in cancer. However, the black-box nature of these models still remains a hurdle in their adoption for precision cancer medicine. Recent efforts have focused on making these models interpretable by incorporating signaling pathway information in model architecture. While these models improve interpretability, it is unclear whether this higher interpretability comes at the cost of less accurate predictions, or a prediction improvement can also be obtained. Results: In this study, we comprehensively and systematically assessed four state-of-the-art interpretable models developed for drug response prediction to answer this question using three pathway collections. Our results showed that models that explicitly incorporate pathway information in the form of a latent layer perform worse compared to models that incorporate this information implicitly. Moreover, in most evaluation setups the best performance is achieved using a simple black-box model. In addition, replacing the signaling pathways with randomly generated pathways shows a comparable performance for the majority of these interpretable models. Our results suggest that new interpretable models are necessary to improve the drug response prediction performance. In addition, the current study provides different baseline models and evaluation setups necessary for such new models to demonstrate their superior prediction performance.

    "abstract": "Lipotoxicity, the accumulation of lipids in non-adipose tissues, alters the metabolic transcriptome and mitochondrial metabolism in skeletal muscle. The mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. Here we show that lipotoxicity increased histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) and histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5), which reduced the expression of metabolic genes and oxidative metabolism in skeletal muscle, resulting in increased non-oxidative glucose metabolism. This metabolic reprogramming was also associated with impaired apoptosis and ferroptosis responses, and preserved muscle cell viability in response to lipotoxicity. Mechanistically, increased HDAC4 and 5 decreased acetylation of p53 at K120, a modification required for transcriptional activation of apoptosis. Redox drivers of ferroptosis derived from oxidative metabolism were also reduced. The relevance of this pathway was demonstrated by overexpression of loss-of-function HDAC4 and HDAC5 mutants in skeletal muscle of obese db/db mice, which enhanced oxidative metabolic capacity, increased apoptosis and ferroptosis and reduced muscle mass. This study identifies HDAC4 and HDAC5 as repressors of skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism, which is linked to inhibition of cell death pathways and preservation of muscle integrity in response to lipotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "Biological systems frequently contain biochemical species present as small numbers of slowly diffusing molecules, leading to fluctuations that invalidate deterministic analyses of system dynamics. The development of mathematical tools that account for the spatial distribution and discrete number of reacting molecules is vital for understanding cellular behavior and engineering biological circuits. Here we present an algorithm for an event-driven stochastic spatiotemporal simulation of a general reaction process that bridges well-mixed and unmixed systems. The algorithm is based on time-varying particle probability density functions whose overlap in time and space is proportional to reactive propensity. We show this to be mathematically equivalent to the Gillespie algorithm in the specific case of fast diffusion. We develop a computational implementation of this algorithm and provide a Fourier transformation-based approach which allows for near constant computational complexity with respect to the number of individual particles of a given species. To test this simulation method, we examine reaction and diffusion limited regimes of a bimolecular association-dissociation reaction. In the reaction limited regime where mixing occurs between individual reactions, equilibrium numbers of components match the expected values from mean field methods. In the diffusion limited regime, however, spatial correlations between newly dissociated species persist, leading to rebinding events and a shift the in the observed molecular counts. In the final part of this work, we examine how changes in enzyme efficiency can emerge from changes in diffusive mobility alone, as may result from protein complex formation.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of cell signaling in chondrocytes and in bone cells, such as osteocytes, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and an elevated burden of senescent cells in cartilage and bone, are implicated in osteoarthritis (OA). Mass spectrometric analyses provides a crucial molecular tool-kit to understand complex signaling relationships in age-related diseases, such as OA. Here we introduce a novel mass spectrometric workflow to promote proteomic studies of bone and cartilage. This workflow uses highly specialized steps, including extensive overnight demineralization, pulverization, and incubation for 72 h in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and EDTA, followed by proteolytic digestion. Analysis on a high-resolution Orbitrap Eclipse and Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer using Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA) provides deep coverage of the bone proteome, and preserves post-translational modifications, such as hydroxyproline. A spectral library-free quantification strategy, directDIA, identified and quantified over 2,000 protein groups (with [&ge;] 2 unique peptides) from calcium-rich bone matrices. Key components identified were proteins of the extracellular matrix (ECM), bone-specific proteins (e.g., secreted protein acidic and cysteine rich, SPARC, and bone sialoprotein 2, IBSP), and signaling proteins (e.g., transforming growth factor beta-2, TGFB2), and lysyl oxidase homolog 2 (LOXL2), an important protein in collagen crosslinking. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) were identified without the need for specific enrichment. This includes collagen hydroxyproline modifications, chemical modifications for collagen self-assembly and network formation. Multiple senescence factors were identified, such as complement component 3 (C3) protein of the complement system and many matrix metalloproteinases, that might be monitored during age-related bone disease progression. Our innovative workflow yields in-depth protein coverage and quantification strategies to discover underlying biological mechanisms of bone aging and to provide tools to monitor therapeutic interventions. These novel tools to monitor the bone proteome open novel horizons to investigate bone-specific diseases, many of which are age-related.",

    "abstract": "Proper synthesis and maintenance of a multilayered cell envelope is critical for bacterial fitness. However, whether mechanisms exist to coordinate synthesis of the membrane and peptidoglycan layers is unclear. In Bacillus subtilis, synthesis of peptidoglycan (PG) during cell elongation is mediated by an elongasome complex acting in concert with class A PBPs (aPBPs). We previously described mutant strains limited in their capacity for PG synthesis due to a loss of aPBPs and an inability to compensate by upregulation of elongasome function. Growth of these PG-limited cells can be restored by suppressor mutations predicted to decrease membrane synthesis. One suppressor mutation leads to an altered function repressor, FapR*, that functions as a super-repressor and leads to decreased transcription of fatty acid synthesis (FAS) genes. Consistent with fatty acid limitation mitigating cell wall synthesis defects, inhibition of FAS by cerulenin also restored growth of PG-limited cells. Moreover, cerulenin can counteract the inhibitory effect of {beta}-lactams in some strains. These results imply that limiting PG synthesis results in impaired growth, in part, due to an imbalance of PG and cell membrane synthesis and that B. subtilis lacks a robust physiological mechanism to reduce membrane synthesis when PG synthesis is impaired.\n\nImportanceUnderstanding how a bacterium coordinates cell envelope synthesis is essential to fully appreciate how bacteria grow, divide, and resist cell envelope stresses such as {beta}-lactam antibiotics. Balanced synthesis of the peptidoglycan cell wall and the cell membrane is critical for cells to maintain shape, turgor pressure and resist external cell envelope threats. Using Bacillus subtilis, we show that cells deficient in peptidoglycan synthesis can be rescued by compensatory mutations that decrease the synthesis of fatty acids. Further, we show that inhibiting fatty acid synthesis with cerulenin is sufficient to restore growth of cells deficient in peptidoglycan synthesis. Understanding the coordination of cell wall and membrane synthesis may provide insights relevant to antimicrobial treatment.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic transitions in related taxa often share a common genetic basis, which suggests that there are constraints that shape the process of evolution at the genetic level. For example, noncoding changes in a gene might be favored relative to coding changes due to being less constrained by pleiotropic effects. Here we evaluate the importance of coding-sequence changes to the recent evolution of a novel anthocyanin pigmentation trait in the monkeyflower genus Mimulus. The magenta-flowered Mimulus luteus var. variegatus recently gained petal lobe anthocyanin pigmentation via a single-locus Mendelian difference from its sister taxon, the yellow-flowered M. l. luteus. Previous work showed that the differentially expressed transcription factor gene MYB5a/NEGAN is the single causal gene. However, it was not clear whether MYB5a coding-sequence evolution (in addition to the observed patterns of differential expression) might also have contributed to increased anthocyanin production in M. l. variegatus. Quantitative image analysis of tobacco leaves, transfected with highly expressed MYB5a coding sequence from each taxon, revealed robust anthocyanin production driven by both alleles compared to a negative control. Counter to expectations, significantly higher anthocyanin production was driven by the coding sequence from the low-anthocyanin taxon M. l. luteus. Together with previously-published expression studies, this supports the hypothesis that petal pigment in M. l. variegatus was not gained by protein-coding changes, but instead via non- coding cis-regulatory evolution. Finally, while constructing the transgenes needed for this experiment, we unexpectedly discovered two sites in MYB5a that appear to be post- transcriptionally edited - a phenomenon that has been rarely reported, and even less often explored, for nuclear-encoded plant mRNAs.",

    "abstract": "Fluid cognition usually declines as people grow older. For decades, neuroscientists have been on a quest to search for a biomarker that can help capture fluid cognition. One well-known candidate is Brain Age, or a predicted value based on machine-learning models built to predict chronological age from brain MRI data. Here we aim to formally evaluate the utility of Brain Age as a biomarker for capturing fluid cognition among older individuals. Using 504 aging participants (36-100 years old) from the Human Connectome Project in Aging, we created 26 age-prediction models for Brain Age based on different combinations of MRI modalities. We first tested how much Brain Age from these age-prediction models added to what we had already known from a persons chronological age in capturing fluid cognition. Based on the commonality analyses, we found a large degree of overlap between Brain Age and chronological age, so much so that, at best, Brain Age could uniquely add only around 1.6% in explaining variation in fluid cognition. Next, the age-prediction models that performed better at predicting chronological age did NOT necessarily create better Brain Age for capturing fluid cognition over and above chronological age. Instead, better-performing age-prediction models created Brain Age that overlapped larger with chronological age, up to around 29% out of 32%, in explaining fluid cognition, thus not improving the models utility to capture cognitive abilities. Lastly, we tested how much Brain Age missed the variation in the brain MRI that could explain fluid cognition. To capture this variation in the brain MRI that explained fluid cognition, we computed Brain Cognition, or a predicted value based on prediction models built to directly predict fluid cognition (as opposed to chronological age) from brain MRI data. We found that Brain Cognition captured up to an additional 11% of the total variation in fluid cognition that was missing from the model with only Brain Age and chronological age, leading to around a 1/3-time improvement of the total variation explained. Accordingly, we demonstrated the limited utility of Brain Age as a biomarker for fluid cognition and made some suggestions to ensure the utility of Brain Age in explaining fluid cognition and other phenotypes of interest.",

    "abstract": "Animals have evolved two defense strategies to survive infections. Antagonistic strategies include mechanisms of immune resistance that operate to sense and kill invading pathogens. Cooperative or physiological defenses mediate host adaptation to the infected state, limiting physiological damage and disease, without killing the pathogen, and have been shown to cause asymptomatic carriage and transmission of lethal pathogens. Here we demonstrate that physiological defenses cooperate with the adaptive immune response to generate long-term asymptomatic carriage of the lethal enteric murine pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium. Asymptomatic carriage of genetically virulent C. rodentium provided immune resistance against subsequent infections. Host immune protection was dependent on systemic antibody responses and pathogen virulence behavior, rather than the recognition of specific virulent factor antigens. Finally, we demonstrate that an avirulent strain of C. rodentium in the field has background mutations in two genes that are important for LPS structure. Our work reveals novel insight into how asymptomatic infections can arise mechanistically with immune resistance, mediating exclusion of phenotypically virulent enteric pathogen to promote asymptomatic carriage.",

    "abstract": "Myosin functions as the \"molecular motor\" of the sarcomere and generates the contractile force necessary for cardiac muscle contraction. Myosin light chains 1 and 2 (MLC-1 and -2) play important functional roles in regulating the structure of the hexameric myosin molecule. Each of these light chains has an  atrial and  ventricular isoform, so called because they are believed to exhibit chamber-restricted expression in the heart. However, recently the chamber-specific expression of MLC isoforms in the human heart has been questioned. Herein, we analyzed the expression of MLC-1 and -2 atrial and ventricular isoforms in each of the four cardiac chambers in adult non-failing donor hearts using top-down mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics. Strikingly, we detected an isoform thought to be ventricular, MLC-2v, in the atria and confirmed the protein sequence using tandem MS (MS/MS). For the first time, a putative deamidation post-translation modification (PTM) located on MLC-2v in atrial tissue was localized to amino acid N13. MLC-1v and MLC-2a were the only MLC isoforms exhibiting chamber-restricted expression patterns across all donor hearts. Importantly, our results unambiguously show that MLC-1v, not MLC-2v, is ventricle-specific in adult human hearts. Overall, top-down proteomics allowed us an unbiased analysis of MLC isoform expression throughout the human heart, uncovering previously unexpected isoform expression patterns and PTMs.",

The current statistical method for high-dimensional replicability analysis either cannot control the false discovery rate (FDR) or is too conservative.\n\nResultsWe propose a statistical method, JUMP, for the high-dimensional replicability analysis of two studies. The input is a high dimensional paired sequence of p-values from two studies and the test statistic is the maximum of p-values of the pair. JUMP uses four states of the p-value pairs to indicate whether they are null or non-null. Conditional on the hidden states, JUMP computes the cumulative distribution function of the maximum of p-values for each state to conservatively approximate the probability of rejection under the composite null of replicability. JUMP estimates unknown parameters and uses a step-up procedure to control FDR. By incorporating different states of composite null, JUMP achieves a substantial power gain over existing methods while controlling the FDR. Analyzing two pairs of spatially resolved transcriptomic datasets, JUMP makes biological discoveries that otherwise cannot be obtained by using existing methods.\n\nAvailabilityAn R package JUMP implementing the JUMP method is available on CRAN (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=JUMP).",

    "abstract": "Aberrant skipping of coding exons in CD19 and CD22 compromises responses to immunotherapy for B-cell malignancies. Here, we show that the MS4A1 gene encoding human CD20 also produces several mRNA isoforms with distinct 5 untranslated regions (5-UTR). Four variants (V1-4) were detectable by RNA-seq in distinct stages of normal B-cell differentiation and B-lymphoid malignancies, with V1 and V3 being the most abundant by far. During B-cell activation and Epstein-Barr virus infection, redirection of splicing from V1 to V3 coincided with increased CD20 positivity. Similarly, in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma only V3, but not V1, correlated with CD20 protein levels, suggesting that V1 might be translation-deficient. Indeed, the longer V1 isoform was found to contain upstream open reading frames (uORFs) and a stem-loop structure, which cooperatively inhibited polysome recruitment. By modulating CD20 isoforms with splice-switching Morpholino oligomers, we enhanced CD20 expression and anti-CD20 antibody rituximab-mediated cytotoxicity in a panel of B-cell lines. Furthermore, reconstitution of CD20-knockout cells with V3 mRNA led to the recovery of CD20 positivity, while V1-reconstituted cells had undetectable levels of CD20 protein. Surprisingly, in vitro CD20-directed CAR T cells were able to kill both V3- and V1-expressing cells, but the bispecific T cell engager mosunetuzumab was only effective against V3-expressing cells. To determine whether CD20 splicing is involved in immunotherapy resistance, we performed RNA-seq on four post-mosunetuzumab follicular lymphoma relapses and discovered that in two of them downregulation of CD20 was accompanied by the V3-to-V1 shift. Thus, splicing-mediated mechanisms of epitope loss extend to CD20-directed immunotherapies.\n\nKey PointsO_LIIn normal & malignant human B cells, CD20 mRNA is alternatively spliced into four 5-UTR isoforms, some of which are translation-deficient.\nC_LIO_LIThe balance between translation-deficient and -competent isoforms modulates CD20 protein levels & responses to CD20-directed immunotherapies\nC_LI\n\nExplanation of NoveltyWe discovered that in normal and malignant B-cells, CD20 mRNA is alternatively spliced to generate four distinct 5-UTRs, including the longer translation-deficient V1 variant. Cells predominantly expressing V1 were still sensitive to CD20-targeting chimeric antigen receptor T-cells. However, they were resistant to the bispecific anti-CD3/CD20 antibody mosunetuzumab, and the shift to V1 were observed in CD20-negative post-mosunetuzumab relapses of follicular lymphoma.",

    "abstract": "Osteocytes are the resident mechanosensory cells in bone. They are responsible for skeletal homeostasis and adaptation to mechanical cues. Integrin proteins play an prominent role in osteocyte mechanotransduction, however the details are not well stratified in vivo. Intravital imaging with multiphoton microscopy presents an opportunity to study molecular level mechanobiological events in vivo, and could be used to study integrin dynamics in osteocytes. However, fluorescent imaging limitations with respect to excessive optical scattering and low signal to noise ratio caused by mineralized bone matrix make such investigations non-trivial. Here we demonstrate that ultra-small and bright fluorescent core-shell silica nanoparticles (<7nm diameter), known as Cornell Prime Dots (CDots), are well-suited for the in vivo bone microenvironment and can improve intravital imaging capabilities. We report validation studies for CDots as a novel, locally injected in vivo osteocyte imaging tool for both non-specific cellular uptake and for targeting integrins. The pharmacokinetics of CDots reveal distinct sex differences in nanoparticle cycling and clearance in osteocytes, which represents a novel topic of study in bone biology. Integrin-targeted CDots were used to study osteocyte integrin dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, we report here the first evidence of osteocyte integrin endocytosis and recycling in vivo. Our results provide novel insights in osteocyte biology and will open up new lines of investigation that were previously unavailable in vivo.",

To delineate populations and identify potential zones of hybridisation, we conducted a discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC), admixture analysis, and calculated pairwise Fst values. The DAPC revealed four clusters: southern California, eastern Rocky Mountains, northwestern Rocky Mountains and Oregon/northern California. We then used BayeScEnv to highlight significant outlier SNPs associated with the five environmental variables. We identified over 150 genes linked to outlier SNPs associated with more than 15 pathways, including stress response and circadian rhythm. We also found a strong signal of isolation by distance.

    "abstract": "Dynamic resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) characterizes time-varying fluctuations of functional brain network activity. While many studies have investigated static functional connectivity, it has been unclear whether features of dynamic functional connectivity are associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Popular sliding-window and clustering methods for extracting dynamic RSFC have various limitations that prevent extracting reliable features to address this question. Here, we use a novel and robust time-varying dynamic network (TVDN) approach to extract the dynamic RSFC features from high resolution magnetoencephalography (MEG) data of participants with Alzheimers disease (AD) and matched controls. The TVDN algorithm automatically and adaptively learns the low-dimensional spatiotemporal manifold of dynamic RSFC and detects dynamic state transitions in data. We show that amongst all the functional features we investigated, the dynamic manifold features are the most predictive of AD. These include: the temporal complexity of the brain network, given by the number of state transitions and their dwell times, and the spatial complexity of the brain network, given by the number of eigenmodes. These dynamic features have high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing AD from healthy subjects. Intriguingly, we found that AD patients generally have higher spatial complexity but lower temporal complexity compared with healthy controls. We also show that graph theoretic metrics of dynamic component of TVDN are significantly different in AD versus controls, while static graph metrics are not statistically different. These results indicate that dynamic RSFC features are impacted in neurodegenerative disease like Alzheimers disease, and may be crucial to understanding the pathophysiological trajectory of these diseases.",

However, current research is mainly focused on molecular mechanisms and preventive strategies targeting cardiomyocyte I/R injury, whereas insufficient attention is placed on protecting endothelial function.\n\nMethods and ResultsIn this study, we established an interlink among ulinastatin (UIT; a serine protease inhibitor), the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS), and EC injury in response to cardiac reperfusion for the first time, using in vitro and in vivo experiments, and bioinformatic analysis. Our data indicated that UTI affected I/R by inhibiting the activation of KKS and simultaneously down-regulating both bradykinin receptor 1 (Bdkrb1) and bradykinin receptor 2 (Bdkrb2) related signaling such as extracellularsignal-regulated kinase (ERK)/inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), thereby reducing infarct size, attenuating inflammation and edema, and improving cardiac function and mortality.\n\nInterestingly, UIT significantly suppressed KLK1 activity but did not down-regulate the KKS in normal conditions, suggesting inhibition of KLK1 might be the crucial mechanism for UIT-induced cardioprotection in reperfusion injury. Moreover, knockdown of Bdkrb1 in reperfusion-induced cardiac endothelial cells (MCECs) injury significantly prevented ERK translocation into the nucleus, reducing apoptosis, junction disruption, and expression levels of cytokines, whereas Bdkrb2 deletion could not protect MCECs against I/R injury.\n\nConclusionsOur findings imply that inhibition of KLK1/Bdkrb1 is a critical target for UIT in the treatment of reperfusion-induced cardiac endothelial inflammation, apoptosis, and leakage and might be a potential therapeutic strategy for cardiac reperfusion injury.",

Here, live-cell monitoring of changes to chromosome copy numbers is developed and studied under diverse perturbations, including Myosin-II inhibition in confined mitosis. Squeezing of mitotic cells is seen in vivo and kills in vitro, but stem cells and cancer cells that survive show heritable loss of mono-allelic GFP/RFP-tagged constitutive genes that function as novel Chromosome-reporters (ChReporters). Myosin-II suppression increases such loss in 3D & 2D confinement but not in standard 2D, with \"lethal\" multipolar divisions proving myosin-dependent. Viable chromosome loss after confined mitosis associates more with mis-segregation than with multipolars or division number. Solid human tumors and teratomas in mice also show ChReporter loss and a confinement-signature of Myosin-II suppression, although losses are selected against in 2D culture. Heritable loss in rigid-confinement also appears independent of a spindle assembly checkpoint that functions in 2D. Confinement and myosin-II thus regulate pathways of heritable mechanogenetic change.",

    "abstract": "Directed transport of cellular components is often dependent on the processive movements of cytoskeletal motors. Myosin 2 motors predominantly engage actin filaments of opposing orientation to drive contractile events, and are therefore not traditionally viewed as processive. However, recent in vitro experiments with purified non-muscle myosin 2 (NM2) demonstrated myosin 2 filaments could move processively. Here, we establish processivity as a cellular property of NM2. Processive runs in central nervous system-derived CAD cells are most apparent as processive movements on bundled actin in protrusions that terminate at the leading edge. We find that processive velocities in vivo are consistent with in vitro measurements. NM2 makes these processive runs in its filamentous form against lamellipodia retrograde flow, though anterograde movement can still occur in the absence of actin dynamics. Comparing the processivity of NM2 isoforms, we find that NM2A moves slightly faster than NM2B. Finally, we demonstrate that this is not a cell-specific property, as we observe processive-like movements of NM2 in the lamella and subnuclear stress fibers of fibroblasts. Collectively, these observations further broaden NM2 functionality and the biological processes in which the already ubiquitous motor can contribute.",

The raw data were filtered and normalised using BioNavigator. The kinase analyses were conducted with R, mainly including kinase-substrate mapping and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis.\n\nResultsThe present analysis reveals that kinomic responses are distinct for acute versus sustained GLP-1R agonist (GLP-1RA) exposure, with individual responses associated with agonists presenting specific bias profiles. According to pathway analysis, several kinases, including JNKs, PKCs, INSR and LKB1, are important GLP-1R signalling mediators, constituting potential targets for further research on biased GLP-1R downstream signalling.\n\nConclusionResults from this study suggest that differentially biased exendin-phe1 and exendin-asp3 can modulate distinct kinase interaction networks. Further understanding of these mechanisms will have important implications for the selection of appropriate anti-T2D therapies with optimised downstream kinomic profiles.",

We demonstrate the modularity of LOVtag by using it to tag a range of proteins, including the LacI repressor, CRISPRa activator, and the AcrB efflux pump. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of pairing the LOVtag with existing optogenetic tools to enhance performance by developing a combined EL222 and LOVtag system. Finally, we use the LOVtag in a metabolic engineering application to demonstrate post-translational control of metabolism.

    "abstract": "Cell lines are indispensable models for modern biomedical research. In the era of CRISPR gene editing, they serve as versatile tools for preclinical studies, allowing patient specific mutations to be modeled or corrected and the resulting phenotypic outcomes studied. A large part of their usefulness derives from the ability of a cell line to proliferate over multiple passages (often indefinitely) allowing multiple experiments to be performed. However, over time, the cell line identity and purity can be compromised by human errors. Both cross contamination from other cell lines and even complete misidentification are possible. Routine cell line authentication is a necessary preventive measure and has become a requirement for many funding applications and publications. Short tandem repeat (STR) profiling is the most common method for cell line authentication and is usually carried out using standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-capillary electrophoresis (CE) analysis (STR-CE). Here we evaluated next generation sequencing (NGS)-based STR profiling of human and mouse cell lines at 18 and 15 loci, respectively, in a high-throughput format. Using the program STRight written in Python, we demonstrate that NGS-based analysis (STR-NGS) is superior to standard STR-CE in terms of the ability to report the sequence context of repeat motifs, sensitivity, and flexible multiplexing capability. STR-NGS is a valuable alternative for cell line authentication.",

    "abstract": "Radial spokes (RS) are T-shaped multiprotein complexes on the axonemal microtubules. Repeated RS1, RS2, and RS3 couple the central pair to modulate ciliary and flagellar motility. Despite the cell type specificity of RS3 substructures, their molecular components remain largely unknown. Here, we report that a leucine-rich repeat-containing protein, LRRC23, is an RS3 head component essential for its head assembly and flagellar motility in mammalian spermatozoa. From infertile male patients with defective sperm motility, we identified a splice site variant of LRRC23. A mutant mouse model mimicking this variant produces a truncated LRRC23 at the C-terminus that fails to localize to the sperm tail, causing male infertility due to defective sperm motility. LRRC23 was previously proposed to be an ortholog of the RS stalk protein RSP15. However, we found that purified recombinant LRRC23 interacts with an RS head protein RSPH9, which is abolished by the C-terminal truncation. Evolutionary and structural comparison also shows that LRRC34, not LRRC23, is the RSP15 ortholog. Cryo-electron tomography clearly revealed that the absence of the RS3 head and the sperm-specific RS2-RS3 bridge structure in LRRC23 mutant spermatozoa. Our study provides new insights into the structure and function of RS3 in mammalian spermatozoa and the molecular pathogenicity of LRRC23 underlying reduced sperm motility in infertile human males.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic vesicle proteins (SVps) are thought to travel in heterogeneous carriers dependent on the motor UNC-104/KIF1A. In C. elegans neurons, we found that some SVps are transported along with lysosomal proteins by the motor UNC-104/KIF1A. LRK-1/LRRK2 and the clathrin adaptor protein complex AP-3 are critical for the separation of lysosomal proteins from SVp transport carriers. In lrk-1 mutants, both SVp carriers and SVp carriers containing lysosomal proteins are independent of UNC-104, suggesting that LRK-1 plays a key role in ensuring UNC-104-dependent transport of SVps. Additionally, LRK-1 likely acts upstream of the AP-3 complex and regulates the membrane localization of AP-3. The action of AP-3 is necessary for the active zone protein SYD-2/Liprin- to facilitate the transport of SVp carriers. In the absence of the AP-3 complex, SYD-2/Liprin- acts with UNC-104 to instead facilitate the transport of SVp carriers containing lysosomal proteins. We further show that the mistrafficking of SVps into the dendrite in lrk-1 and apb-3 mutants depends on SYD-2, likely by regulating the recruitment of the AP-1/UNC-101. We propose that SYD-2 acts in concert with both the AP-1 and AP-3 complexes to ensure polarized trafficking of SVps.",

    "abstract": "Salient cues, such as the rising sun or the availability of food, play a crucial role in entraining biological clocks, allowing for effective behavioral adaptation and ultimately, survival. While the light-dependent entrainment of the central circadian pacemaker (suprachiasmatic nucleus, SCN) is relatively well defined, the molecular and neural mechanisms underlying entrainment associated with food availability remains elusive. Using single nucleus RNA sequencing during scheduled feeding (SF), we identified a leptin receptor (LepR) expressing neuron population in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) that upregulates circadian entrainment genes and exhibits rhythmic calcium activity prior to an anticipated meal. We found that disrupting DMHLepR neuron activity had a profound impact on both molecular and behavioral food entrainment. Specifically, silencing DMHLepR neurons, mis-timed exogenous leptin administration, or mis-timed chemogenetic stimulation of these neurons all interfered with the development of food entrainment. In a state of energy abundance, repetitive activation of DMHLepR neurons led to the partitioning of a secondary bout of circadian locomotor activity that was in phase with the stimulation and dependent on an intact SCN. Lastly, we discovered that a subpopulation of DMHLepR neurons project to the SCN with the capacity to influence the phase of the circadian clock. This leptin regulated circuit serves as a point of integration between the metabolic and circadian systems, facilitating the anticipation of meal times.",

    "abstract": "Stapled -helical peptides can bind to and modulate historically intractable targets while addressing the traditional liabilities associated with peptide therapeutics. However, their pipeline advancement has been impeded by the challenges of identifying peptides with sufficient cellular uptake to engage the target protein while lacking off-target toxicities. Here, we advance the field to arrive at a workflow for identifying advanced stapled peptide lead molecules with on-target in vivo activity with no off-target cell proliferation effects. Specifically, we generated a >350-member library based on ATSP-7041, a stapled peptide Mdm2(X) antagonist with validated on-target cellular effects but with significant off-target activity. Key insights from library analysis include 1) a clear correlation between lipophilicity and permeability, 2) removal of positive charge to avoid off-target toxicities, 3) judicious placement of anionic residues to enhance peptide solubility/behavior, 4) optimization of C-terminal length and helicity to enhance cell activity, 5) optimization of staple type/number to avoid polypharmacology. Incorporation of one or more of these attributes led to molecules with improved in vitro and in vivo activities (up to a >292x improved cell proliferation EC50). A subset of peptides were devoid of off-target cell proliferation effects in cell lines lacking wild-type p53 protein (up to a >3800x on-target index). This latter improvement contrasted with clinical Mdm2 antagonistic molecules. Application of these  design rules to a distinct Mdm2(X) peptide series resulted in rapid improvement in cellular activity (>150x) and removal of off-target toxicities. Overall, the detailed workflow outlined here should help researchers identify stapled -helical peptides for therapeutic impact.",

    "abstract": "Brief stimuli can trigger longer lasting brain states. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) could help sustain such states by coupling slow-timescale molecular signals to neuronal excitability. Brainstem parabrachial nucleus glutamatergic neurons (PBNGlut) regulate sustained brain states such as pain, and express Gs-coupled GPCRs that increase cAMP signaling. We asked whether cAMP directly influences PBNGlut excitability and behavior. Both brief tail shocks and brief optogenetic stimulation of cAMP production in PBNGlut neurons drove minutes-long suppression of feeding. This suppression matched the duration of prolonged elevations in cAMP, Protein Kinase A (PKA), and calcium activity in vivo and in vitro. Shortening this elevation in cAMP reduced the duration of feeding suppression following tail shocks. cAMP elevations in PBNGlut neurons rapidly lead to sustained increases in action potential firing via PKA-dependent mechanisms. Thus, molecular signaling in PBNGlut neurons helps prolong neural activity and behavioral states evoked by brief, salient bodily stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophages must seize control of the host gene expression machinery to promote their own protein synthesis. Since the bacterial hosts are armed with numerous anti-phage defence systems, it is essential that mechanisms of host take-over act immediately upon infection. Although individual proteins that modulate components of the bacterial gene expression apparatus have been described in several different phages, systematic approaches which capture the phages arsenal for immediate targeting of host transcription and translation processes have been lacking. In particular, there are no known phage factors that associate directly with host ribosomes to modulate protein synthesis. Here, we take an integrative high-throughput approach to uncover numerous new proteins encoded by the jumbo phage {Phi}KZ that target the gene expression machinery of the Gram-negative human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa immediately upon infection. By integrating biochemical and structural analyses, we identify a conserved phage factor that associates with the large ribosomal subunit by binding the 5S ribosomal RNA. This highly abundant factor is amongst the earliest {Phi}KZ proteins expressed after infection and stays bound to ribosomes during the entire translation cycle. Our study provides a general strategy to decipher molecular components of phage-mediated host take-over and argues that phage genomes represent a large discovery space for proteins that modulate the host gene expression machinery.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria have evolved numerous defence systems to combat phage infection, but our understanding of the underlying mechanisms is limited beyond their antiviral function. Here, we provide mechanistic insights into the Kiwa defence system, which is composed of two proteins, the transmembrane protein KwaA and the DUF4868 domain-containing protein KwaB. Using Kiwa from Escherichia coli ECOR8 and ECOR12, we found that KwaA detects phage infection by sensing inhibition of the host RNA polymerase. Consequently, the inhibitory effect of KwaA on the effector protein KwaB is relieved, which results in decreased phage DNA replication efficiency through a RecBCD-dependent pathway. Notably, Kiwa restores RecBCD activity even against phages that encode anti-RecBCD proteins. Our findings also reveal that KwaB has antiphage activity in the absence of both KwaA and phage trigger, but the conserved two-protein Kiwa operon implies that strict regulation of KwaB activity by KwaA is necessary to prevent potential auto-immunity.",

    "abstract": "Vascular endothelial cells (VEC) are essential for retinal homeostasis and their dysfunction underlies pathogenesis in diabetic retinopathy (DR) and exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Studies have shown that recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors are effective at delivering new genetic material to neural and glial cells within the retina, but targeting VECs remains challenging. To overcome this limitation, herein we developed rAAV capsid mutant vectors with improved tropism towards retinal VEC. rAAV2/2, 2/2[QuadYF-TV], and rAAV2/9 serotype vectors (n=9, capsid mutants per serotype) expressing GFP were generated by inserting heptameric peptides (7AA) designed to increase endothelial targeting at positions 588 (2/2 and 2/2[QuadYF-TV] or 589 (2/9) of the virus protein (VP 1-3). The packaging and transduction efficiency of the vectors were assessed in HEK293T and bovine VECs using Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, leading to the identification of one mutant, termed EC5, that showed improved endothelial tropism when inserted into all three capsid serotypes. Intra-ocular and intravenous administration of EC5 mutants in C57Bl/6j mice demonstrated moderately improved transduction of the retinal vasculature, particularly surrounding the optic nerve head, and evidence of sinusoidal endothelial cell transduction in the liver. Most notably, intravenous administration of the rAAV2/2[QuadYF-TV] EC5 mutant led to a dramatic and unexpected increase in cardiac muscle transduction.",

    "abstract": "Myriad bacterial anti-phage systems have been described and often the mechanism of programmed cell death is invoked for phage inhibition. However, there is little evidence of  suicide under physiological conditions for these systems. Instead of death to stop phage propagation, we show here that persister cells, i.e., transiently-tolerant, dormant, antibiotic-insensitive cells, are formed and survive using the Escherichia coli C496_10 tripartite toxin/antitoxin system MqsR/MqsA/MqsC to inhibit T2 phage. Specifically, MqsR/MqsA/MqsC inhibited T2 phage by one million-fold and reduced T2 titers by 500-fold. During T2 phage attack, in the presence of MqsR/MqsA/MqsC, evidence of persistence include the single-cell physiological change of reduced metabolism (via flow cytometry), increased spherical morphology (via transmission electron microscopy), and heterogeneous resuscitation. Critically, we found restriction-modification systems (primarily EcoK McrBC) work in concert with the toxin/antitoxin system to inactivate phage, likely while the cells are in the persister state. Phage attack also induces persistence in Klebsiella and Pseudomonas spp. Hence, phage attack invokes a stress response similar to antibiotics, starvation, and oxidation, which leads to persistence, and this dormant state likely allows restriction/modification systems to clear phage DNA.",

    "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) manifests as a major health concern, particularly for the elderly. Understanding AKI-related proteome changes is critical for prevention and development of novel therapeutics to recover kidney function and to mitigate the susceptibility for recurrent AKI or development of chronic kidney disease. In this study, mouse kidneys were subjected to ischemia-reperfusion injury, and the contralateral kidneys remained uninjured to enable comparison and assess injury-induced changes in the kidney proteome. A fast-acquisition rate ZenoTOF 7600 mass spectrometer was introduced for data-independent acquisition (DIA) for comprehensive protein identification and quantification. Short microflow gradients and the generation of a deep kidney-specific spectral library allowed for high-throughput, comprehensive protein quantification. Upon AKI, the kidney proteome was completely remodeled, and over half of the 3,945 quantified protein groups changed significantly. Downregulated proteins in the injured kidney were involved in energy production, including numerous peroxisomal matrix proteins that function in fatty acid oxidation, such as ACOX1, CAT, EHHADH, ACOT4, ACOT8, and Scp2. Injured mice exhibited severely declined health. The comprehensive and sensitive kidney-specific DIA assays highlighted here feature high-throughput analytical capabilities to achieve deep coverage of the kidney proteome and will serve as useful tools for developing novel therapeutics to remediate kidney function.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial stress inducers, such as the proton ionophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) and the ATPase pump inhibitor oligomycin, trigger the DELE1-HRI branch of the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway. Previous studies performed using epitope-tagged forms of DELE1 showed that these stresses induced the accumulation of a cleaved form of DELE1, DELE1-S, which stimulates HRI. Here, we report that mitochondrial protein import stress (MPIS) is an overarching stress that triggers the DELE1-HRI pathway, and that endogenous DELE1 could be cleaved into two forms, DELE1-S and DELE1-VS, the latter accumulating only upon non- depolarizing MPIS. We further showed that DELE1 specifically senses MPIS triggered by the inhibition of the TIM23 complex at the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). While MPIS can also cause mitophagy induction through engagement of the NLRX1-RRBP1 pathway, we observed that DELE1-HRI and NLRX1-RRBP1 signaling were engaged independently upon MPIS. Surprisingly, our results suggest that in our cellular model the mitochondrial protease OMA1 was dispensable for DELE1 cleavage upon MPIS. Instead, we identified a key role for another mitochondrial protease, HtrA2, in mediating the cleavage of DELE1 into DELE1-S and DELE1- VS. Our data further suggest that DELE1 is likely cleaved into DELE1-S by HtrA2 in the cytosol, while the DELE1-VS form might be generated during halted translocation of the protein into mitochondria. Together, this study identifies MPIS as the overarching stress detected by DELE1 and identifies HtrA2 as a critical protease involved in DELE1 processing.",

    "abstract": "An epithelium in a living organism seldom develops in isolation. Rather, most epithelia are tethered to other epithelial or non-epithelial tissues, necessitating growth coordination between layers. We investigated how two tethered epithelial layers of the Drosophila larval wing imaginal disc, the disc proper (DP) and the peripodial epithelium (PE), coordinate their growth. DP growth is driven by the morphogens Hedgehog (Hh) and Dpp, but regulation of PE growth is poorly understood. We find that the PE adapts to changes in growth rates of the DP, but not vice versa, suggesting a \"leader and follower\" mechanism. Moreover, PE growth can occur by cell shape changes, even when proliferation is inhibited. While Hh and Dpp pattern gene expression in both layers, growth of the DP is exquisitely sensitive to Dpp levels, while growth of the PE is not; the PE can achieve an appropriate size even when Dpp signaling is inhibited. Instead, both the growth of the PE and its accompanying cell shape changes require the activity of two components of the mechanosensitive Hippo pathway, the DNA-binding protein Scalloped (Sd) and its co-activator (Yki), which could allow the PE to sense and respond to forces generated by DP growth. Thus, an increased reliance on mechanically-dependent growth mediated by the Hippo pathway, at the expense of morphogen-dependent growth, enables the PE to evade layer-intrinsic growth control mechanisms and coordinate its growth with the DP. This provides a potential paradigm for growth coordination between different components of a developing organ.",

    "abstract": "Although ants are conceived of as paragons of social complexity, it may be their locomotory capacity that truly sets them apart from other Hymenoptera. Based on our comparative kinematic analysis of Formicidae for level, straight-line locomotion in a broad phylogenetic context, we observe that ants are distinctly capable runners. No sampled hymenopteran paralleled the body-scaled speed of ants. Relative stride lengths for ants were longer than other sampled taxa despite short ground contact durations relative to swing durations. With respect to spatial gait patterns, ants had relatively narrow hindleg and broad midleg step-widths on average, possibly enhancing speed and turning ability. Ants were able to extend their propulsive pair of legs, those of the metathorax, extremely far posterad relative to other sampled taxa, and had a distinct locomotory posture, with a high ground clearance and the femorotibial joints raised above their backs. Despite the unique modifications of their coxotrochanteral articulations, ant forelimbs were largely unremarkable with respect to our quantified variables. Sawflies, in contrast, had extremely wide and perhaps inefficient foreleg stances, and were observed for the first time to have what appears to be a dominant tetrapodal gait pattern, which raises unexpected questions about the early evolution of the Hymenoptera. Finally, we observed variability in attachment abilities and no consistent pattern of leg liftoff sequence across the sampled taxa. Our results establish locomotory evolution in the Hymenoptera as a functionally and structurally variable system with numerous directions of future research, particularly for phylogenetic comparison across wing-monomorphic and wing-polymorphic lineages.\n\nSummary statementThis work establishes a comparative phylogenetic approach to hymenopteran kinematics, demonstrating that ant locomotory capacity is derived and observes, unexpectedly, that the sampled sawflies (symphyta) never used a tripod gait.",

    "abstract": "In the negative feedback loop composing the Neurospora circadian clock, the core element, FREQUENCY (FRQ) binds with FRH (FRQ-interacting RNA helicase) and Casein Kinase 1 (CK1) to form the FRQ-FRH complex (FFC) which represses its own expression by interacting with and promoting phosphorylation of its transcriptional activators White Collar-1 (WC-1) and WC-2 (together forming the White Collar Complex, WCC). Physical interaction between FFC and WCC is a prerequisite for the repressive phosphorylations, and although the motif on WCC needed for this interaction is known, the reciprocal recognition motif(s) on FRQ remains poorly defined. To address this, FFC-WCC was assessed in a series of frq segmental-deletion mutants, confirming that multiple dispersed regions on FRQ are necessary for its interaction with WCC. Biochemical analysis shows that interaction between FFC and WCC but not within FFC or WCC can be disrupted by high salt, suggesting that electrostatic forces drive the association of the two complexes. As a basic sequence on WC-1 was previously identified as a key motif for WCC-FFC assembly, our mutagenetic analysis targeted negatively charged residues of FRQ leading to identification of three Asp/Glu clusters in FRQ that are indispensable for FFC-WCC formation. Surprisingly, in several frq Asp/Glu-to-Ala mutants that vastly diminish FFC-WCC interaction, the core clock still oscillates robustly with an essentially WT period, indicating that the binding strength between the positive and negative elements in the feedback loop is required for the clock but is not a determinant of the period length.",

While the principle of torque generation by proton transfer is known, the mechanisms and routes of proton access and release and their evolution are not fully understood. Here, we show that the entry site and path of protons in the lumenal half-channel of mitochondrial ATP synthases are largely defined by a short N-terminal -helix of subunit-a. In Trypanosoma brucei and other Euglenozoa, the -helix is part of another polypeptide chain that is a product of subunit-a gene fragmentation. This -helix and other elements forming the proton pathway are widely conserved across eukaryotes and in Alphaproteobacteria, the closest extant relatives of mitochondria, but not in other bacteria. The -helix blocks one of two proton routes found in Escherichia coli, resulting in the single proton entry site in mitochondrial and alphaproteobacterial ATP synthases. Thus, the shape of the access half-channel predates eukaryotes and originated in the lineage from which mitochondria evolved by endosymbiosis.",

The engineered PC could be released in its activated form and significantly prolonged the plasma coagulation time independent of the cofactor activity of protein S in vitro. The adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector-mediated expression of the engineered PC, but not wild-type PC, prolonged coagulation time owing to the inhibition of activated coagulation factor V in a dose-dependent manner and abolished pathological thrombus formation in vivo in C57BL/6 mice. The insertion of EGFP sequence conjugated with self-cleaving peptide sequence at Alb locus via neonatal in vivo genome editing using AAV vector resulted in the expression of EGFP in 7% of liver cells, mainly via homology-directed repair, in mice. Finally, we succeeded in improving the survival of PC-deficient mice by expressing the engineered PC via neonatal genome editing in vivo.

We developed a new machine transfer learning architecture (crisprHAL) that can be trained on existing datasets and that shows marked improvements in sgRNA activity prediction accuracy when transfer learning is used with small amounts of high-quality data.

Here, we investigated the impact of non-synonymous mutations in SF3B1 and U2AF1, two splicing factors commonly mutated in cancer, on transcription. We find that the mutations impair RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription elongation along gene bodies leading to transcription-replication conflicts, replication stress and altered chromatin organization. This elongation defect is linked to disrupted pre-spliceosome assembly due to impaired protein-protein interactions of mutant SF3B1. Through an unbiased screen, we identified epigenetic factors in the Sin3/HDAC complex, which, when modulated, normalize transcription defects and their downstream effects. Our findings shed light on the mechanisms by which oncogenic mutant spliceosomes impact chromatin organization through their effects on RNAPII transcription elongation and present a rationale for targeting the Sin3/HDAC complex as a potential therapeutic strategy.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS- Oncogenic mutations in SF3B1 and U2AF1 cause a gene body RNAPII transcription elongation defect\n- The elongation defect is linked to impaired assembly of early spliceosome complexes and leads to replication stress and changes to chromatin landscape\n- RNAPII elongation defects in SF3B1K700E are normalized by modulating epigenetic factors but 3 cryptic splicing events are not reversed\n- Targeting the Sin3/HDAC pathway to normalize RNAPII elongation defect is a potential therapeutic approach in these disorders\n\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=139 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/530019v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (50K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dc6d22org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@180f36borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ed341forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f8dfb2_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal disease with few available therapeutic options. Two transcriptional cancer cell states have been consistently reported in PDAC, with the basal-like/squamous phenotype displaying a more aggressive biological behavior. Genetic and epigenetic dysregulation of the axon guidance pathway are common in PDAC, yet our understanding of its biological relevance is limited. Here, we investigated the functional role of the axon guidance cue SEMA3A in sustaining the progression of PDAC. We integrated available transcriptomic datasets of human PDAC with in situ hybridization analyses of patients tissues to find that SEMA3A is expressed by stromal cells and selectively enriched in epithelial cells of the basal-like/squamous subtype. We found that both cell-intrinsic and cell extrinsic factors instructing the basal-like/squamous subtype induce expression of SEMA3A in PDAC cells. In vitro, SEMA3A promoted cell migration as well as anoikis resistance. At molecular level, these phenotypes were associated with increased FAK signaling and enrichment of gene programs related to cytoskeleton remodeling. Accordingly, SEMA3A provided mouse PDAC cells with greater metastatic competence. In mouse orthotopic allografts, SEMA3A remodeled the TME by favoring infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages and exclusion of T cells. Mechanistically, SEMA3A functioned as chemoattractant for macrophages and favored their polarization towards an M2-like phenotype. In SEMA3Ahigh tumors, depletion of macrophages resulted in greater intratumor infiltration by CD8+ T cells and increased sensitivity of these tumors to chemotherapy. Overall, we show that SEMA3A contributes to the malignant phenotype of basal-like PDAC.",

    "abstract": "AimsSoil-borne pathogens severely damage the yield and quality of crops worldwide. Plant and soil microbiomes (e.g. in the rhizosphere) intimately interact with the plant, the pathogen and influence outcomes of disease infection. Investigation of how these microbiomes respond to disease infection is critical to develop solutions to control diseases.\n\nMethodsHere, we conducted a field experiment and collected healthy and crown rot disease infected (caused by Fusarium pseudograminearum, Fp) wheat plants. We investigated their microbiomes in different compartments, plant immune responses and interactions with the pathogen (Fp) aiming at advancing our knowledge on microbiome-mediated regulation of plant responses to pathogens.\n\nResultsWe found that Fp colonised wheat plants in significant loads, accounting for 11.3% and 60.7% of the fungal communities in the rhizosphere and root endosphere, respectively. However, Fp presented with a small fraction of the leaf microbiome, up to 1.2%. Furthermore, Fp-infection led to significant changes in the composition of the microbial communities in the rhizosphere and root endosphere while had little impact on leaves. We further found that wheat defence signalling pathways, wheat microbiomes and the pathogen intimately correlated with each other in structural equation modelling. As such, we also identified ecological clusters explained changes in the wheat defence signalling pathways. Lastly, microbial co-occurrence network complexity was higher in Fp-infected plants relative to healthy plants, suggesting that Fp-infection has potentially induced more microbial interactions in plants.\n\nConclusionsWe provide novel evidence that soil-borne diseases significantly disrupt belowground plant microbiomes influencing the responses of plant immunity to pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Post-embryonic plant development must be coordinated in response to and with environmental feedback. Development of above-ground organs is orchestrated from stem cells in the center of the shoot apical meristem (SAM). Heat can pose significant stress to plants and induces a rapid heat response, developmental alterations, chromatin decondensation, and activation of transposable elements (TEs). However, most plant heat-stress studies are conducted with whole plants, not resolving cell-type-specific responses. Heat stress consequences in stem cells are of particular significance, as they can potentially influence the next generation. Here we use fluorescent-activated nuclear sorting to isolate and characterize stem cells after heat exposure and after a recovery period in wild type and mutants defective in TE defense and chromatin compaction. Our results indicate that stem cells can suppress the heat response pathways that dominate surrounding somatic cells and maintain their developmental program. Furthermore, mutants defective in DNA methylation recover less efficiently from heat stress and persistently activate heat response factors and heat-inducible TEs. Heat stress also induces epimutations at the level of DNA methylation, and we find hundreds of DNA methylation changes three weeks after stress. Our results underline the importance of disentangling cell type-specific environmental responses for understanding plant development.",

    "abstract": "Carotenoids are susceptible to degrading processes initiated by oxidative cleavage reactions mediated by Carotenoid Cleavage Dioxygenases that break their backbone, leading to products called apocarotenoids. These carotenoid-derived metabolites include the phytohormones abscisic acid and strigolactones, and different signaling molecules and growth regulators, which are utilized by plants to coordinate many aspects of their life. Several apocarotenoids have been recruited for the communication between plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and as regulators of the establishment of AM symbiosis. However, our knowledge on their biosynthetic pathways and the regulation of their pattern during AM symbiosis is still limited. In this study, we generated a qualitative and quantitative profile of apocarotenoids in roots and shoots of rice plants exposed to high/low phosphate concentrations, and upon AM symbiosis in a time course experiment covering different stages of growth and AM development. To get deeper insights in the biology of apocarotenoids during this plant-fungal symbiosis, we complemented the metabolic profiles by determining the expression pattern of CCD genes, taking advantage of chemometric tools. This analysis revealed the specific profiles of CCD genes and apocarotenoids across different stages of AM symbiosis and phosphate supply conditions, identifying novel markers at both local and systemic levels.\n\nHighlightOur study presents the profiles of CCD gene expression and apocarotenoids across different stages of AM symbiosis and Pi supply conditions and reveals novel AM markers at both local and systemic levels.",

    "abstract": "Microglia and neuroinflammation are implicated in the development and progression of Alzheimers disease (AD). To better understand microglia-mediated processes in AD, we studied the function of INPP5D/SHIP1, a gene linked to AD through GWAS. Immunostaining and single nucleus RNA sequencing confirmed that INPP5D expression in the adult human brain is largely restricted to microglia. Examination of prefrontal cortex across a large cohort revealed reduced full length INPP5D protein levels in AD patient brains compared to cognitively normal controls. The functional consequences of reduced INPP5D activity were evaluated in human induced pluripotent stem cell derived microglia (iMGLs), using both pharmacological inhibition of the phosphatase activity of INPP5D and genetic reduction in copy number. Unbiased transcriptional and proteomic profiling of iMGLs suggested an upregulation of innate immune signaling pathways, lower levels of scavenger receptors, and altered inflammasome signaling with INPP5D reduction. INPP5D inhibition induced the secretion of IL-1{beta} and IL-18, further implicating inflammasome activation. Inflammasome activation was confirmed through visualization of inflammasome formation through ASC immunostaining in INPP5D-inhibited iMGLs, increased cleaved caspase-1 and through rescue of elevated IL-1{beta} and IL-18 with caspase-1 and NLRP3 inhibitors.

Poor cochlear implantation outcomes are seen in some patients. To develop biological treatment for TMPRSS3 patients, we generated a knock-in mouse model with a frequent human DFNB8 TMPRSS3 mutation. The Tmprss3A306T/A306T homozygous mice display delayed onset progressive hearing loss similar to human DFNB8 patients. Using AAV2 as a vector to carry a human TMPRSS3 gene, AAV2-hTMPRSS3 injection in the adult knock-in mouse inner ears results in TMPRSS3 expression in the hair cells and the spiral ganglion neurons. A single AAV2-hTMPRSS3 injection in aged Tmprss3A306T/A306T mice leads to sustained rescue of the auditory function, to a level similar to the wildtype mice.

    "abstract": "The present study explores the role of the cytosolic branched chain amino acid aminotransferase (BCAT1) in CD8+ T cell activation, in general, and tumor immunity, in particular, and identifies a non-canonical function of the protein in iron homeostasis. Pharmacologic inhibition of BCAT1 using the novel drug ERG245 abrogates the effector functions of CD8+ T cells in vitro and metabolically reprograms the cells towards increased OXPHOS. In vivo, it suppresses activation of CD8+ T cells in DSS colitis leading to improved disease outcomes. Remarkably, withdrawal of BCAT1 inhibition further amplifies OXPHOS and gives rise to CD8+ T cells with increased cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. When combined with an anti-PD-1 treatment, temporal BCAT1 inhibition dramatically increases anti-PD-1 efficacy inducing complete and durable tumor regressions in the moderately immunogenic CT26 tumor model. Single cell RNA-seq data link expression of Bcat genes to exhausted T cells within the tumor microenvironment of human cancer patients, whereas in vitro assays indicate that BCAT1 inhibition partially prevents the adoption of a terminally exhausted phenotype by CD8+ T cells. We propose BCAT1 as a target for cancer combinatory therapies.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEThe study explores for the first time the role of BCAT1 in CD8+ T cell activation and proposes novel strategies for using BCAT1 inhibitors in cancer and beyond. It demonstrates that BCAT1 exerts its function without significantly altering branched chain amino acid (BCAA) levels through a mechanism that controls iron homeostasis, a novel non-canonical mechanism of action, and implicates BCAT1 in the adoption of an exhausted phenotype by T cells found in human cancers. While the majority of metabolic drugs temper OXPHOS, it demonstrates that an agent that increases OXPHOS in CD8+ T cells can be used successfully as an immune-oncology drug.",

    "abstract": "Surveillance for emerging human influenza virus clades is important for identifying changes in viral fitness and assessing antigenic similarity to vaccine strains. While fitness and antigenic structure are both important aspects of virus success, they are distinct characteristics and do not always change in a complementary manner. The 2019-20 Northern Hemisphere influenza season saw the emergence of two H1N1 clades: A5a.1 and A5a.2. While several studies indicated that A5a.2 showed similar or even increased antigenic drift compared with A5a.1, the A5a.1 clade was still the predominant circulating clade that season. Clinical isolates of representative viruses from these clades were collected in Baltimore, Maryland during the 2019-20 season and multiple assays were performed to compare both antigenic drift and viral fitness between clades. Neutralization assays performed on serum from healthcare workers pre- and post-vaccination during the 2019-20 season show a comparable drop in neutralizing titers against both A5a.1 and A5a.2 viruses compared with the vaccine strain, indicating that A5a.1 did not have antigenic advantages over A5a.2 that would explain its predominance in this population. Plaque assays were performed to investigate fitness differences, and the A5a.2 virus produced significantly smaller plaques compared with viruses from A5a.1 or the parental A5a clade. To assess viral replication, low MOI growth curves were performed on both MDCK-SIAT and primary differentiated human nasal epithelial cell cultures. In both cell cultures, A5a.2 yielded significantly reduced viral titers at multiple timepoints post-infection compared with A5a.1 or A5a. Receptor binding was then investigated through glycan array experiments which showed a reduction in receptor binding diversity for A5a.2, with fewer glycans bound and a higher percentage of total binding attributable to the top three highest bound glycans. Together these data indicate that the A5a.2 clade had a reduction in viral fitness, including reductions in receptor binding, that may have contributed to the limited prevalence observed after emergence.",

With optimized RNA biochemistry to enhance recovery and analysis of small RNAs, we show rPAL is at least an order of magnitude more sensitive than previous methods for detecting sialoglycoRNAs. These improvements allow rPAL to detect sialoglycoRNA from human clinical samples as demonstrated by defining the abundance and patterns of sialoglycoRNAs from sorted populations of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The sensitivity, robustness, and flexibility of rPAL will allow greater access towards characterizing glycoRNA biology.",

    "abstract": "Recent adaptive radiations provide evolutionary case studies which can be parsed to reveal the relationship between genomic variation and the origins of distinct phenotypes. Sympatric radiations of the charr complex (genus Salvelinus) present a trove for comparative genomics as charrs have repeatedly diversified into multiple morphs with distinct feeding specializations. However, stereotypical species flocks are assemblages of only two to three lineages. However, a species flock of Dolly Varden charr (Salvelinus malma) in Lake Kronotskoe contains at least seven lineages, each with defining morphological and ecological traits. This is the most extensive radiation described for the genus. Here, we perform the first genome-wide analysis of this species flock to parse the genetic foundations of adaptive change. Our data support distinct, reproductively isolated lineages with little hybridization. We also find that specific selection on thyroid and craniofacial genes forms a shared basis for the radiation. The data also implicate thyroid signaling in subsequent lineage specification. These results delineate a clear genetic basis for the diversification of specialized lineages, and highlight the role of developmental mechanisms in shaping the forms generated during adaptive radiation.",

While cyclic peptides have gained significant traction as a therapeutic modality, developing deep learning methods for designing such peptides has been slow, mostly due to the small number of available structures for molecules in this size range.

Our results show this approach can accurately predict the structures of native cyclic peptides from a single sequence, with 36 out of 49 cases predicted with high confidence (pLDDT > 0.85) matching the native structure with root mean squared deviation (RMSD) less than 1.5 [A]. Further extending our approach, we describe computational methods for designing sequences of peptide backbones generated by other backbone sampling methods and for de novo design of new macrocyclic peptides. We extensively sampled the structural diversity of cyclic peptides between 7-13 amino acids, and identified around 10,000 unique design candidates predicted to fold into the designed structures with high confidence. X-ray crystal structures for seven sequences with diverse sizes and structures designed by our approach match very closely with the design models (root mean squared deviation < 1.0 [A]), highlighting the atomic level accuracy in our approach.

The scavenging action mediates the availability of the chemokine CXCL12 for the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) CXCR4 and requires phosphorylation of the ACKR3 C-terminus by GPCR kinases (GRKs). ACKR3 is phosphorylated by GRK2 and GRK5, but the mechanisms by which these kinases regulate the receptor are unresolved. Here we mapped the phosphorylation patterns and determined that GRK5 phosphorylation of ACKR3 dominates {beta}-arrestin recruitment and chemokine scavenging over GRK2. Co-activation of CXCR4 significantly enhanced phosphorylation by GRK2 through the liberation of G{beta}{gamma}. These results suggest that ACKR3  senses CXCR4 activation through a GRK2-dependent crosstalk mechanism. Surprisingly, we also found that despite the requirement for phosphorylation, and the fact that most ligands promote {beta}-arrestin recruitment, {beta}-arrestins are dispensable for ACKR3 internalization and scavenging, suggesting a yet to be determined function for these adapter proteins.",

    "abstract": "The breeding of crops with improved nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) is crucial for sustainable agriculture. However, the role of epigenetic modification in the regulation of cultivar-specific responses to low nitrogen (LN) constraint is not well understood. Here, we analyzed the chromatin landscapes in roots, leaves, and seeds in two wheat cultivars (KN9204 and J411) that differ radically in NUE under normal and nitrogen-limited conditions. Transcriptional regulatory chromatin regions exhibited a clear cultivar-specificity between KN9204 and J411. Cultivar-specific regulation of nitrogen metabolism genes (NMGs) is linked to variation in histone modification levels, rather than differences in DNA sequence. Cultivar-specific histone modification regions were found to contribute to the genetic regulation of NUE-related traits, such as QTL locus of maximum root length of qMRL-7B. Furthermore, LN-induced H3K27ac and H3K27me3 dynamics enhanced root growth more in KN9204, while strengthened the nitrogen uptake system more in J411. Evidence from histone deacetylase inhibitor treatment and transgenic plants with loss-of-function of the H3K27me3 methyltransferase further showed that changes in epigenetic modifications can alter the strategy for root development and nitrogen uptake in response to LN constraint. Taken together, the results of our study highlight the importance of epigenetic regulation in mediating cultivar-specific root development and metabolic adaptation to LN in wheat.",

    "abstract": "In mammals, the most remarkable T cell variations with aging are the shrinking of naive T cell pool and enlargement of memory T cell pool, which are partially caused by thymic involution. However, it remains an enigma whether these T-cell-related changes are consequences or causes of mammalian aging. In this study, we find that the T-cell specific Rip1 KO mice present similar age-related T cell changes and exhibit signs of accelerated aging, including inflammation, multiple age-related diseases and a shorter lifespan. Mechanistically, T cells lacking RIP1 displayed excessive apoptosis, leading to T cell compensatory proliferation, hyperactivation, increased inflammation, and ultimately premature death. Consistent with this, blocking apoptosis by co-deletion of Fadd in Rip1 deficient T cells significantly recovered the lymphopenia and imbalance between naive and memory T cell, substantially restored ageing-related phenotypes, and prolonged life span in T-cell specific Rip1 KO mice. These results suggest that changes in T cells play a causal role in mammalian aging. Therefore, replenishing or blocking apoptosis of naive T cells could offer new therapeutic approaches for aging and age-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "For animals that synthesise their chemical compounds de novo, resources, particularly proteins, can influence investment in chemical defences and nitrogen-based wing colouration such as melanin. Competing for the same resources often leads to trade-offs in resource allocation. We manipulated protein availability in the larval diet of the wood tiger moth, Arctia plantaginis, to test how early life resource availability influences relevant life history traits, melanin production, and chemical defences. We expected higher dietary protein to result in more effective chemical defences and a higher amount of melanin in the wings. According to the resource allocation hypothesis, we also expected individuals with less melanin to have more resources to allocate to chemical defences. We found that protein-deprived moths had a slower larval development, and their chemical defences were less unpalatable for bird predators, but the expression of melanin in their wings did not differ from that of moths raised on a high-protein diet. The amount of melanin in the wings, however, unexpectedly correlated positively with chemical defences, irrespective of the diet they were raised on. Our findings demonstrate that the resources available in early life have an important role in the efficacy of chemical defences, but melanin-based warning colours are less sensitive to resource variability than other fitness-related traits.",

    "abstract": "Genomics has strongly increased the available experimental strategies to identify the elements involved in regulatory networks, particularly those of the regulation of transcription initiation. As new methodologies emerge, a natural step is to compare their results with available knowledge obtained by previously established methodologies, such as the classic methods of molecular biology used to characterize transcription factor binding and regulatory sites, promoters, and transcription units.\n\nSuch previous knowledge is dispersed in the scientific literature, limiting their accessibility. Fortunately, in the case of Escherichia coli K-12, the best studied microorganism, we have been continuously gathering this knowledge from original scientific publications for the last 30 years, and have made it available to the public in two databases, RegulonDB and EcoCyc. More recently, we have also gathered knowledge generated by genomic high throughput (HT) methodologies as can be appreciated in the latest RegulonDB version 11.0, where, in addition to the objects and interactions identified by methods of molecular biology, users can find datasets of binding sites from ChIP-seq, ChIP-exo, gSELEX and DAP-seq HT technologies. This has motivated us to work on improving our evidence codes to facilitate their use as gold standards. In order to enhance the precision of knowledge representation, we implemented three alternatives to curate regulatory interactions, based on the level of detail provided by the experiments. We present them in a way that users can select different versions of objects based on properties such as the methods used to identify them (classic, computational predictions, HT methods); in vivo vs in vitro approaches; and degree of confidence (weak, strong, confirmed) of the evidence supporting them. The collection of regulatory interactions is analyzed based on their supporting evidence, showing how classic methods still provide for the largest fraction of strong and confirmed sites, a distribution likely to change in the years to come as HT methods may become the dominant strategies to identify regulatory genomic components. We plan to keep updating and expanding these gold standard datasets as part of future RegulonDB releases.",

    "abstract": "Load-induced volume change is an important aspect of knee meniscus function because volume loss creates fluid pressure, which minimizes friction and helps support compressive loads. The knee meniscus is unusual amongst cartilaginous tissues in that it is loaded not only in axial compression, but also in circumferential tension between its tibial attachments. Despite the physiologic importance of the knee meniscus tensile properties, its volumetric strain in tension has never been directly measured, and predictions of volume strain in the scientific literature are inconsistent. In this study, we apply uniaxial tension to bovine knee meniscus and use biplanar imaging to directly observe the resulting 3D volume change and unloaded recovery, revealing that tension causes volumetric contraction. Compression is already known to also cause contraction; therefore, all major physiologic loads compress and pressurize the meniscus, inducing fluid outflow. Although passive unloaded recovery is often described as slow relative to loaded loss, here we show that at physiologic strains the volume recovery rate in the meniscus upon unloading is faster than the rate of volume loss. These measurements of volumetric strain are an important step towards a complete theory of knee meniscus fluid flow and load support.",

    "abstract": "The composition of immune cells in peripheral blood is dramatically remodeled throughout the human lifespan, as environmental exposures shape the proportion and phenotype of cellular subsets. These dynamic shifts complicate efforts to identify disease-associated immune signatures in type 1 diabetes (T1D), which is variable in age of onset and rate of {beta}-cell decline. Herein, we conducted standardized flow cytometric immune profiling on peripheral blood from a cross-sectional cohort of T1D participants (n=240), their first-degree relatives (REL, n=310), those at increased risk with two or more islet autoantibodies (RSK, n=24), and autoantibody negative healthy controls (CTR, n=252). We constructed an immune-age predictive model in healthy subjects and developed an interactive data visualization portal (ImmScape; https://ufdiabetes.shinyapps.io/ImmScape/). When applied to the T1D cohort, this model revealed accelerated immune aging (p<0.001) as well as phenotypic signatures of disease after age correction. Of 192 investigated flow cytometry and complete blood count readouts, 46 were significantly associated with age only, 25 with T1D only, and 23 with both age and T1D. Phenotypes associated with T1D after age-correction were predictive of T1D status (AUROC=82.3%). Phenotypes associated with accelerated aging in T1D included increased CXCR3+ and PD-1+ frequencies in naive and memory T cell subsets, despite reduced PD-1 expression levels (mean fluorescence intensity) on memory T cells. Additionally, quantitative trait locus analysis linked an increase in HLA-DR expression on monocytes with the T1D-associated HLA-DR4/DQ8 genotype, regardless of clinical group. Our findings demonstrate advanced immune aging in T1D and highlight disease-associated phenotypes for biomarker monitoring and therapeutic interventions.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryPeripheral blood characterization reveals accelerated immune-age and age-adjusted proinflammatory immune phenotypes in type 1 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Extreme weather conditions, like heatwave events, are becoming more frequent with climate change. Animals often modify their behaviour to cope with environmental changes and extremes. If the environmental conditions influence the trade-off between an individuals social propensity and optimal thermoregulation through shade use for instance, then divergent social decisions may be made. Hence, such behavioural changes have the potential to influence an individuals position in its social network, and the social network structure as a whole. We investigated whether heat stress conditions (quantified through the Temperature Humidity Index) and the resulting use of shaded areas, influences the social network structure and an individuals position in it. We studied this in free-ranging sheep in the arid zone of Australia, GPS-tracking all 48 individuals in a flock. When heat stress conditions worsened, individuals spent more time in the shade and the network was more connected (higher density) and less modular. Furthermore, an individuals social connectivity scaled with its shade use behaviour. Interestingly, individuals with intermediate shade use were most strongly connected (degree, strength, betweeness), indicating their importance for the connectivity of the social network during heat stress conditions. Our study shows that heat stress conditions, which are predicted to increase in severity and frequency due to climate change, influence the resource use within the ecological environment. This has flow on effects for the animals social environment through the changed social network structure.\n\nSignificance statementDue to climate change, animals experience heat stress conditions more frequently. When ambient temperatures are high, individuals can seek shaded areas to mitigate the effect. However, whether these behavioural changes affect the interaction patterns in social species is not well understood. We tracked all individuals in a flock of sheep using GPS collars. We demonstrate that when heat stress conditions worsened (higher temperature humidity index), individuals spent more time in the shade and the social network was more connected with less internal structure. Furthermore, an individuals social connectivity scaled with its shade use behaviour, and individuals with intermediate shade use were most strongly connected in their social network. Our findings illustrate that individuals respond to climate change induced environmental conditions and that this has flow on effects for their social connectivity and the social network of the group.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer (OC) ranks as the second most common type of gynecological malignancy, has poor survival rates, and is frequently diagnosed at an advanced stage. Platinum-based chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, represents the standard-of-care for OC. However, toxicity and acquired resistance to therapy have proven challenging in the treatment of patients, most of who will experience relapse, mainly due to chemoresistance. Chemoresistance, a principal obstacle to durable response in OC patients, is attributed to alterations within the cancer cells, and can also be mediated by the tumor microenvironment (TME).\n\nIn this study, we report that conditioned medium (CM) derived from murine and human stromal cells, MS-5 and HS-5 respectively, and tumor-activated HS-5, was active in conferring platinum chemoresistance to OC cells. Moreover, CM derived from differentiated murine pre-adipocyte (3T3-L1), but not undifferentiated pre-adipocyte cells, confers platinum chemoresistance to OC cells. Interestingly, CM derived from tumor-activated HS-5 was more effective in conferring chemoresistance than was CM derived from HS-5 cells.\n\nVarious OC cells exhibit variable sensitivity to CM activity. Moreover, exposure of OC to CM affected ERK1/2 phosphorylation in a non-consistent pattern and in a cell-specific manner, and does not correlate with platinum chemoresistance. Exploring CM content revealed the enrichment of a number of soluble factors in the tumor-activated HS-5, such as soluble uPAR (SuPAR), IL-6, and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). FDA-approved JAK inhibitors were mildly effective in restoring platinum sensitivity in two of the three OC cell lines in the presence of CM. Exposure to increasing concentrations of HGF resulted in increased proliferation and reduced platinum sensitivity. Crizotinib, an ALK and c-MET inhibitor, in combination with platinum, blocked HGFs ability to promote platinum resistance and restore platinum sensitivity to OC cells. Finally, exposure to 2-hydroxyestardiol (2HE2) was effective in restoring platinum sensitivity to OC cells exposed to CM.\n\nOur results showed the significance of soluble factors found in TME in promoting platinum chemoresistance and the potential of combination therapy to restore chemosensitivity to OC cells.",

    "abstract": "A unique signature of neuronal transcriptomes is the high expression of the longest genes in the genome (e.g. >100 kilobases). These genes encode proteins with essential functions in neuronal physiology, and disruption of long gene expression has been implicated in neurological disorders. DNA topoisomerases resolve topological constraints that arise on DNA and facilitate the expression of long genes in neurons. Conversely, methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), which is disrupted in Rett syndrome, can act as a transcriptional repressor to downregulate the expression of long genes. The molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of long genes by these factors are not fully understood, however, and whether or not they directly influence each other is not known. Here, we identify a functional interaction between MeCP2 and Topoisomerase II-beta (TOP2{beta}) in neurons. We show that MeCP2 and TOP2{beta} physically interact in vivo and map protein sequences sufficient for their physical interaction in vitro. We profile TOP2{beta} activity genome-wide in neurons and detect enrichment at regulatory regions and gene bodies of long neuronal genes, including long genes regulated by MeCP2. Further, we find that knockdown and overexpression of MeCP2 leads to altered TOP2{beta} activity at MeCP2-regulated genes. Our findings uncover a mechanism by which MeCP2 inhibits the activity of TOP2{beta} at long genes in neurons and suggest that this mechanism is disrupted in neurodevelopment disorders caused by mutation of MeCP2.",

NMR and EPR spectroscopy demonstrate that the glycans refine the structure of the proteins interdomain interaction. Using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, we further show that cultured cells expressing PrP molecules with mutated glycosylation sites display large, spontaneous inward currents, a correlate of PrP-induced neurotoxicity.

To identify novel factors that modulate the DNA damage response to DNA double strand breaks, we performed an epistatic miniarray profile (E-MAP) analysis of Mec1 and Rad53, two essential kinases that coordinate the DNA damage response in budding yeast. Through this analysis, we discovered a genetic interaction between the kinase module (CKM) of the Mediator of transcription and Rad53. We find that all four subunits of the CKM, as well as CKMs kinase activity are critical for cell cycle re-entry following a DNA break, whereas the core Mediator subunits are dispensable. Notably, CKM mutants do not impair DNA repair by homologous recombination or confer sensitivity to DNA damaging reagents, suggesting that CKM specifically impinges on DNA damage signaling. In support of this, we find that Rad53 and CKM physically interact in response to DNA damage. Following the induction of a DNA break, CKM is a critical regulator of global transcription inhibition. In addition to this global effect, we illustrate that CKM functions locally at DNA breaks together with the core Mediator. In the absence of catalytically active CKM, the CKM-Mediator complexes at DNA breaks are replaced by RNAPII. Taken together, our results reveal a previously uncharacterized role for CKM in the DNA damage response.",
