    "abstract": "Gram-negative bacteremia is a major cause of global morbidity involving three phases of pathogenesis: initial site infection, dissemination, and survival in the blood and filtering organs. Klebsiella pneumoniae is a leading cause of bacteremia and pneumonia is often the initial infection. In the lung, K. pneumoniae relies on many factors like capsular polysaccharide and branched chain amino acid biosynthesis for virulence and fitness. However, mechanisms directly enabling bloodstream fitness are unclear. Here, we performed transposon insertion sequencing (TnSeq) in a tail-vein injection model of bacteremia and identified 58 K. pneumoniae bloodstream fitness genes. These factors are diverse and represent a variety of cellular processes. In vivo validation revealed tissue-specific mechanisms by which distinct factors support bacteremia. ArnD, involved in Lipid A modification, was required across blood filtering organs and supported resistance to soluble splenic factors. The purine biosynthesis enzyme PurD largely enhanced liver fitness and was required for replication in serum. PdxA, a member of the endogenous vitamin B6 biosynthesis pathway, optimized replication in serum and lung fitness. The stringent response regulator SspA was required for splenic fitness yet was dispensable in the liver. In a bacteremic pneumonia model that incorporates initial site infection and dissemination, splenic fitness defects were enhanced, and DsbA, SspA, and PdxA increased fitness across bacteremia phases. SspA and PdxA enhanced K. pnuemoniae resistance to oxidative stress. SspA specifically resists oxidative stress produced by NADPH oxidase Nox2 in the lung, spleen, and liver, as it was a fitness factor in wild-type but not Nox2-deficient (Cybb-/-) mice. These results identify site-specific fitness factors that act during the progression of Gram-negative bacteremia. Defining K. pneumoniae fitness strategies across bacteremia phases could illuminate therapeutic targets that prevent infection and sepsis.\n\nAuthor SummaryGram-negative bacteremia is a deadly family of infections that initiate sepsis, a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality. Only a small number of Gram-negative species contribute to the majority of clinical bacteremia. Klebsiella pneumoniae is the second leading cause of Gram-negative bacteremia, and the third leading cause of overall bloodstream infection. K. pneumoniae is highly linked to hospital-associated infection with increasing antimicrobial resistance, endangering the most vulnerable patients. It is critical to understand the pathogenesis of K. pneumoniae bacteremia to better develop targets for future therapies that can prevent these deadly infections. Here, we define over 50 K. pneumoniae genes that support bloodstream fitness. These factors are diverse, support tissue-specific fitness, and increase bacterial resistance to oxidative stress. Our study is the first to systematically define K. pneumoniae factors enhancing bacteremia in a mammalian system. These results illuminate host-pathogen interactions during K. pneumoniae bacteremia that may be extended to additional Gram-negative species.",

    "abstract": "Expanding antiviral treatment options against SARS-CoV-2 remains crucial as the virus evolves rapidly and drug resistant strains have emerged. Broad spectrum host-directed antivirals (HDA) are promising therapeutic options, however the robust identification of relevant host factors by CRISPR/Cas9 or RNA interference screens remains challenging due to low consistency in the resulting hits.\n\nTo address this issue, we employed machine learning based on experimental data from knockout screens and a drug screen. As gold standard, we assembled perturbed genes reducing virus replication or protecting the host cells. The machines based their predictions on features describing cellular localization, protein domains, annotated gene sets from Gene Ontology, gene and protein sequences, and experimental data from proteomics, phospho-proteomics, protein interaction and transcriptomic profiles of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells.\n\nThe models reached a remarkable performance with a balanced accuracy of 0.82 (knockout based classifier) and 0.71 (drugs screen based classifier), suggesting patterns of intrinsic data consistency. The predicted host dependency factors were enriched in sets of genes particularly coding for development, morphogenesis, and neural related processes. Focusing on development and morphogenesis-associated gene sets, we found {beta}-catenin to be central and selected PRI-724, a canonical {beta}-catenin/CBP disruptor, as a potential HDA. PRI-724 limited infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and IAV in different cell line models. We detected a concentration-dependent reduction in CPE development, viral RNA replication, and infectious virus production in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1-infected cells. Independent of virus infection, PRI-724 treatment caused cell cycle deregulation which substantiates its potential as a broad spectrum antiviral. Our proposed machine learning concept may support focusing and accelerating the discovery of host dependency factors and the design of antiviral therapies.\n\nAuthors summaryDrug resistance to pathogens is a well-known phenomenon which was also observed for SARS-CoV-2. Given the gradually increasing evolutionary pressure on the virus by herd immunity, we attempted to enlarge the available antiviral repertoire by focusing on host proteins that are usurped by viruses. The identification of such proteins was followed within several high throughput screens in which genes are knocked out individually. But, so far, these efforts led to very different results. Machine learning helps to identify common patterns and normalizes independent studies to their individual designs. With such an approach, we identified genes that are indispensable during embryonic development, i.e., when cells are programmed for their specific destiny. Shortlisting the hits revealed {beta}-catenin, a central player during development, and PRI-724, which inhibits the interaction of {beta}-catenin with cAMP responsive element binding (CREB) binding protein (CBP). In our work, we confirmed that the disruption of this interaction impedes virus replication and production. In A549-AT cells treated with PRI-724, we observed cell cycle deregulation which might contribute to the inhibition of virus infection, however the exact underlying mechanisms needs further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Methylation of mRNA on adenosine bases (referred to as m6A) is the most common internal modification of mRNA in eukaryotic cells. Recent work has revealed a detailed view of the biological significance of m6A-modified mRNA, with a role in mRNA splicing, control of mRNA stability, and mRNA translation efficiency. Importantly, m6A is a reversible modification, and the primary enzymes responsible for methylating (Mettl3/Mettl14) and demethylating RNA (FTO/Alkbh5) have been identified. Given this reversibility, we are interested in understanding how m6A addition/removal is regulated. Recently, we identified glycogen synthase kinase-3 (Gsk-3) activity as a mediator of m6A regulation via controlling the levels of the FTO demethylase in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), with Gsk-3 inhibitors and Gsk-3 knockout both leading to increased FTO protein and decreased m6A mRNA levels. To our knowledge, this remains one of the only mechanisms identified for the regulation of m6A modifications in ESCs. Several small molecules that have been shown to promote the retention of pluripotency of ESCs, and interestingly, many have connections to the regulation of FTO and m6A. Here we show that the combination of Vitamin C and transferrin potently reduces levels of m6A and promotes retention of pluripotency in mouse ESCs. Combining Vitamin C and transferrin should prove to be valuable in growing and maintaining pluripotent mouse ESCs.",

Here, we dissect its late developmental roles in primordial germ cell (PGC) specification and spermatogenesis using cellular and animal models. We discover that Tex10 binds the Wnt negative regulator genes, marked by H3K4me3, at the PGC-like cell (PGCLC) stage in restraining Wnt signaling. Depletion and overexpression of Tex10 hyperactivate and attenuate the Wnt signaling, resulting in compromised and enhanced PGCLC specification efficiency, respectively. Using the Tex10 conditional knockout mouse models combined with single-cell RNA sequencing, we further uncover critical roles of Tex10 in spermatogenesis with Tex10 loss causing reduced sperm number and motility associated with compromised round spermatid formation. Notably, defective spermatogenesis in Tex10 knockout mice correlates with aberrant Wnt signaling upregulation. Therefore, our study establishes Tex10 as a previously unappreciated player in PGC specification and male germline development by fine-tuning Wnt signaling.",

    "abstract": "Cell migration is an ubiquitous process in life that is mainly triggered by the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton and therefore is driven by both mechanical properties and biochemical processes. It is a multistep process essential for mammalian organisms and is closely linked to development, cancer invasion and metastasis formation, wound healing, immune response, tissue differentiation and regeneration, and inflammation. Experimental, theoretical and computational studies have been key to elucidate the mechanisms underlying cell migration. On one hand, rapid advances in experimental techniques allow for detailed experimental measurements of cell migration pathways, while, on the other, computational approaches allow for the modelling, analysis and understanding of such observations. Here, we present a computational framework coupling mechanical properties with biochemical processes to model two-dimensional cell migration by considering membrane and cytosolic activities that may be triggered by external cues. Our computational approach shows that the numerical implementation of the mechanobiochemical model is able to deal with fundamental characteristics such as: (i) membrane polarisation, (ii) cytosolic polarisation, and (iii) actin-dependent protrusions. This approach can be generalised to deal with single cell migration through complex non-isotropic environments, both in 2- and 3-dimensions.\n\nAuthor summaryWhen a single or group of cells follow directed movement in response to either chemical and/or mechanical cues, this process is known as cell migration. It is essential for many biological processes such as immune response, embryogenesis, gastrulation, wound repair, cancer metastasis, tumour invasion, inflammation and tissue homeostasis. However, aberrant or defects in cell migration lead to various abnormalities and life-threatening medical conditions [1-4]. Increasing our knowledge on cell migration can help abate the spread of highly malignant cancer cells, reduce the invasion of white cells in the inflammatory process, enhance the healing of wounds and reduce congenital defects in brain development that lead to mental disorders.\n\nIn this study, we present a computational framework that allows us to couple mechanical properties with biochemical signalling processes to study long time behaviour of single cell migration (either directed or random). The novelty is that the evolution law for the velocity (also known as the flow or material velocity) is described by a biomechanical force balance model posed inside the cell and this in turn is driven by the actomyosin spatiotemporal model (following the classical theory of reaction-diffusion) which is responsible for force generation as described in many experimental works [2, 5, 8, 10, 11]. Hence, our modelling approach is based on a new mathematical formalism of bulk-surface partial differential equations coupled with a novel adaptive moving-mesh finite element method to allow for significant cell deformations during migration. The approach set premises to study cell migration through complex non-isotropic environments, thereby giving biologists a predictive tool for modelling cell migration.",

    "abstract": "Most temperate plants can tolerate both chilling and freezing temperatures. Plants have developed self-defense mechanisms to perceive cold signal, trigger the cold tolerance for the cold response ICE1-CBF-COR pathway by packing a cascade of kinase phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events into a functional module. Linked to the central ICE1-CBF-COR model, two sub-models were adopted for the second messenSger Ca2+ -- a one-compartment model for Ca2+ transient and a two-compartment model for a train of Ca2+ spikes. Numerical simulation verified the expression patterns of the cold-induced genes as observed in Arabidopsis thaliana, Brassica napa and Solanum lycopersicum, including wild types and mutants. Moreover, the desensitization and resensitization of CBF3 and COR15A were displayed as well as the dynamics in the gradually decreasing temperature response to cold stress. The duration of cold tolerance was predicted for approximate 10 days. Interpreting and predicting the dynamical behaviors of the cold signaling pathway are valuable and time-saving for understanding mechanisms of cold acclimation.\n\nAuthor summaryIn higher organisms, CBF3 transcriptional level are output in a pulse and COR15A transcriptional level are maintained at a high homeostatic level to respond cold stress, which is determined by a complex set of regulatory mechanisms. Feedback loops from Ca2+ perception onto CaM, kinases, cold-acclimated genes in sequence, which have been experimentally reported, are thought to induce COR15A transcript accumulation under cold temperature exposure. The cold response pathway has been modeled based on a computational model. However, protein kinase cascades made the model relatively complicated and the cold-response gene COR15A was absent. Here, we develop a compact model with cold tolerance target gene COR15A. We show that this model could reproduce the temporal dynamics and characteristics of the core gene variables in different plants with wild type and mutant. Reduction of CaM proportion and augment of negative feedback control by ZAT12 in the model results in the desensitization of CBF3 and COR15A. Less than 24-hr warm treatment loses the ability of resensitization of CBF3 and COR15A after 14-day cold exposure. We further predict that the duration of cold tolerance is maintained at about 10 days in our model.",

    "abstract": "The immune system acts as the intricate apparatus dedicated to mounting a defence that ensures host survival from microbial threats. To engage this faceted immune response and provide protection against infectious diseases, vaccinations are the critical tool developed. However, vaccine responses are governed by levels that when interrogated separately only explain a fraction of the immune reaction. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a feasibility study to determine if multi-view modelling can aid in gaining actionable insights on response markers shared across populations, capture the immune system diversity, and disentangle confounders. We thus sought to assess this multi-view modelling capacity on the responsiveness to Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination.\n\nSeroconversion to vaccine induced antibodies against HBV surface antigen (anti-HBs) in early-converters (n=21; <2 month) and late-converters (n=9; <6 months), was defined based on the anti-HBs titres (>10IU/L). The multi-view data encompassed bulk RNA-seq, CD4+ T cell parameters (including T-cell receptor data), flow cytometry data, and clinical metadata (including age and gender). The modelling included testing single-view and multi-view joint dimensionality reductions. Multi-view joint dimensionality reduction out-performed single-view methods in terms of area under curve and balanced accuracy, confirming an increase in predictive power to be gained. The interpretation of the findings showed that age, gender, inflammation-related gene sets and pre-existing vaccine specific T-cells were associated with vaccination responsiveness.\n\nThis multi-view dimensionality reduction approach complements the clinical seroconversion and all single modalities. Importantly, this modelling could identify what features predict HBV vaccine response. This methodology could be extended to other vaccination trials to identify key features regulating responsiveness.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to early life adversity (ELA), including childhood maltreatment, is one of the most significant risk factors for the emergence of neuropsychiatric disorders in adolescence and adulthood. Despite this relationship being well established, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. One way to achieve this understanding is to identify molecular pathways and processes that are perturbed as a consequence of childhood maltreatment. Ideally, these perturbations would be evident as changes in DNA, RNA or protein profiles in easily accessible biological samples collected in the shadow of childhood maltreatment. In this study, we isolated circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) from plasma collected from adolescent rhesus macaques that had either experienced nurturing maternal care (CONT) or maternal maltreatment (MALT) in infancy. RNA sequencing of RNA in plasma EVs and gene enrichment analysis revealed that genes related to translation, ATP synthesis, mitochondrial function and immune response were downregulated in MALT samples, while genes involved in ion transport, metabolism and cell differentiation were upregulated. Interestingly, we found that a significant proportion of EV RNA aligned to the microbiome and that MALT altered the diversity of microbiome-associated RNA signatures found in EVs. Part of this altered diversity suggested differences in prevalence of bacterial species in CONT and MALT animals noted in the RNA signatures of the circulating EVs. Our findings provide evidence that immune function, cellular energetics and the microbiome may be important conduits via which infant maltreatment exerts effects on physiology and behavior in adolescence and adulthood. As a corollary, perturbations of RNA profiles related to immune function, cellular energetics and the microbiome may serve as biomarkers of responsiveness to ELA. Our results demonstrate that RNA profiles in EVs can serve as a powerful proxy to identify biological processes that might be perturbed by ELA and that may contribute to the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders in the aftermath of ELA.",

We reduced the 11-dimensional parameter space of the CMS into 3D to identify three principal physical parameters that govern cell migration: motor number - describing myosin II activity, clutch number - describing adhesion level, and F-actin polymerization rate. Experimentally, we found that glioblastoma patient-derived (xenograft) (PD(X)) cell lines across mesenchymal (MES), proneural (PN), classical (CL) subtypes and two institutions (N=13 patients) had optimal motility and traction force on stiffnesses around 9.3kPa, with otherwise heterogeneous and uncorrelated motility, traction, and F-actin flow. By contrast, with the CMS parameterization, we found glioblastoma cells consistently had balanced motor/clutch ratios to enable effective migration, and that MES cells had higher actin polymerization rates resulting in higher motility. The CMS also predicted differential sensitivity to cytoskeletal drugs between patients. Finally, we identified 11 genes that correlated with the physical parameters, suggesting that transcriptomic data alone could potentially predict the mechanics and speed of glioblastoma cell migration. Overall, we describe a general physics-based framework for parameterizing individual glioblastoma patients and connecting to clinical transcriptomic data, that can potentially be used to develop patient-specific anti-migratory therapeutic strategies generally.\n\nSignificance StatementSuccessful precision medicine requires biomarkers to define patient states and identify personalized treatments. While biomarkers are generally based on expression levels of protein and/or RNA, we ultimately seek to alter fundamental cell behaviors such as cell migration, which drives tumor invasion and metastasis. Our study defines a new approach for using biophysics-based models to define mechanical biomarkers that can be used to identify patient-specific anti-migratory therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as the workhorse of alcoholic fermentation, is a major actor of winemaking. In this context, this yeast species performs alcoholic fermentation to convert sugars from the grape must into ethanol and CO2 with an outstanding efficiency: it reaches on average 92% of the maximum theoretical yield of conversion. Primary metabolites produced during fermentation stand for a great importance in wine where they significantly impact wine characteristics. Ethanol indeed does, but others too, which are found in lower concentrations: glycerol, succinate, acetate, -ketoglutarate... Their production, which can be characterised by a yield according to the amount of sugars consumed, is known to differ from one strain to another. S. cerevisiae is known for its great genetic diversity and plasticity that is directly related to its living environment, natural or technological and therefore to domestication. This leads to a great phenotypic diversity of metabolites production. However, the range of metabolic diversity is variable and depends on the pathway considered. In the aim to improve wine quality, the selection, development and use of strains with dedicated metabolites production without genetic modifications can rely on the natural diversity that already exists. Here we detail a screening that aims to assess this diversity of primary metabolites production in a set of 51 S. cerevisiae strains from various genetic backgrounds (wine, flor, rum, West African, sake...). To approach winemaking conditions, we used a synthetic grape must as fermentation medium and measured by HPLC five main metabolites. Results obtained pointed out great yield differences between strains and that variability is dependent on the metabolite considered. Ethanol appears as the one with the smallest variation among our set of strains, despite its by far the most produced. A clear negative correlation between ethanol and glycerol yields has been observed, confirming glycerol synthesis as a good lever to impact ethanol yield. Genetic groups have been identified as linked to high production of specific metabolites, like succinate for rum strains or alpha-ketoglutarate for wine strains. This study thus helps to define the phenotypic diversity of S. cerevisiae in a wine-like context and supports the use of ways of development of new strains exploiting natural diversity. Finally, it provides a detailed data set usable to study diversity of primary metabolites production, including common commercial wine strains.",

    "abstract": "Parasitic nematodes are responsible for more than one and a half billion infections world-wide. The drugs developed against these infections only target a few different proteins. As drug resistance is becoming more common, there is a need to develop new drugs against new targets. Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases (PDEs), are enzymes that hydrolyze the cyclic molecules of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP. Physical properties of mammalian PDEs have led them to become well-established as drug targets. Mammals possess 11 families of PDEs, many of which are the target of selective and potent drugs. Nematodes have 6 PDE genes representing 6 families, which have not been well-studied; C. elegans, is a model organism nematode that would allow people to assess the therapeutic benefit of targeting PDEs. The Hoffman Lab has developed a platform for discovering PDE inhibitors and has carried out high-throughput screens (HTS) to help identify inhibitors of mammalian PDE4, PDE7, PDE8, and PDE11 families. The PDE4 family in C. elegans is of particular interest as work in C. elegans suggests that it may be involved in neuronal function. However, research has shown that two compounds developed against mammalian PDE4s generally do not work on C. elegans PDE4. Therefore, the goal of this project is to screen a collection of compounds discovered by the Hoffman Lab to identify the compounds that will affect C. elegans or parasitic nematode PDE4s to find compounds that could then be tested for their effect on C. elegans and parasitic nematodes. This research could then identify an effective new target for drug development to treat infections by parasitic nematodes.\n\nSummaryParasitic nematodes are the soil worms responsible for more than one and a half billion infections around the world. While drugs are being developed against them, these drugs are designed against relatively few proteins, which is a problem as drug resistance becomes more common. Therefore, there is a need for new drugs. PDEs are enzymes that hydrolyze the signaling molecules cAMP and cGMP. Mammalian PDEs have been well-established as drug targets. In nematodes, there are 6 PDE genes representing 6 families of the 11 families found in mammals. Additionally, a free-living model organism nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) can be used to assess the impact of PDE inhibition on nematode biology. In the Hoffman Lab, they have developed a platform for discovering PDE inhibitors and have used these in high throughput screens to identify inhibitors of mammalian PDE4, PDE7, PDE8, and PDE11 families. The PDE4 family in C. elegans is of particular interest as work in C. elegans suggests that it may be involved in neuronal function. However, research has shown that compounds developed against mammalian PDE4s generally do not work on C. elegans PDE4. Therefore, by the end of this project we hope to identify the compounds that do work on nematode PDE4s that could be used to test whether they have the potential to treat these infections.",

To date, all cultivated DPANN Archaea are ectosymbionts that require direct cell contact with an archaeal host species for proliferation. However, the dynamics of DPANN - host interactions and the impacts of these interactions on the host species are poorly understood. Here, we show that one DPANN archaeon (Candidatus Nanohaloarchaeum antarcticus) engages in parasitic interactions with its host (Halorubrum lacusprofundi) that result in host cell lysis. Our data also suggest that these interactions involve invasion of the host cell by the nanohaloarchaeon.

In this study, we screened 12476 publicly available A. baumannii genome assemblies for novel OCL sequences, detecting six new OCL types that were designated OCL17-OCL22. These were compiled with previously characterised OCL to create an updated version of the A. baumannii OCL reference database, providing a total of 22 OCL reference sequences for use with the bioinformatics tool, Kaptive. Use of this database against the 12476 downloaded assemblies found OCL1 to be the most common locus, present in 73.6% of sequenced genomes assigned by Kaptive with a match confidence score of  Good or above. OCL1 was most common amongst isolates belonging to sequence types, ST1, ST2, ST3 and ST78, all of which are over-represented clonal lineages associated with extensive antibiotic resistance. The highest level of diversity in OCL types was found in ST2, with eight different OCL identified. The updated OCL reference database is available for download from GitHub (https://github.com/katholt/Kaptive; under version v 2.0.5), and has been integrated for use on Kaptive-Web (https://kaptive-web.erc.monash.edu/) and PathogenWatch (https://pathogen.watch/), enhancing current methods for A. baumannii strain identification, classification and surveillance.\n\nIMPACT STATEMENTIn the absence of effective treatment options for multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, the highest-ranking critical priority bacterial pathogen of global concern, national and global surveillance is necessary to detect, track and subsequently curb the spread of isolates that resist current therapies. Several epidemiological markers are used to characterise A. baumannii strains by detecting genetic differences in specific regions of the genome. One of these is the chromosomal OC locus (OCL) responsible for the synthesis of the outer core (OC) component of the lipooligosaccharide (LOS).

    "abstract": "Double-stranded DNA viruses utilise machinery, made of terminase proteins, to package viral DNA into the capsid. For cos bacteriophage, a defined signal, recognised by small terminase, flanks each genome unit. Here we present the first structural data for a cos virus DNA packaging motor, assembled from the bacteriophage HK97 terminase proteins, procapsids encompassing the portal protein, and DNA containing a cos site. The cryo-EM structure is consistent with the packaging termination state adopted after DNA cleavage, with DNA density within the large terminase assembly ending abruptly at the portal protein entrance. Retention of the large terminase complex after cleavage of the short DNA substrate suggests that motor dissociation from the capsid requires headful pressure, in common with pac viruses. Interestingly, the clip domain of the 12-subunit portal protein does not adhere to C12 symmetry, indicating asymmetry induced by binding of the large terminase/DNA. The motor assembly is also highly asymmetric, showing a ring of 5 large terminase monomers, tilted against the portal. Variable degrees of extension between N- and C-terminal domains of individual subunits suggest a mechanism of DNA translocation driven by inter-domain contraction and relaxation.",

TBK1 is also important for phosphorylating autophagy adaptors critical in selective autophagic removal of damaged mitochondria (mitophagy). However, the mechanism by which TBK1 is activated by PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the autophagy adaptor OPTN provides a unique platform for TBK1 activation. The OPTN-ubiquitin and OPTN-autophagy machinery interaction axes facilitate assembly of the OPTN-TBK1 complex at a contact site between damaged mitochondria and the autophagosome formation site. This assembly point serves as a positive feedback loop for TBK1 activation by accelerating hetero-autophosphorylation of the protein. Furthermore, expression of monobodies engineered in this study against OPTN impaired assembly of OPTN at the contact sites as well as the subsequent activation of TBK1 and mitochondrial degradation. Taken together the findings reveal that a positive reciprocal relationship between OPTN and TBK1 initiates autophagosome biogenesis on damaged mitochondria.",

    "abstract": "Protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) are a family of molecular chaperones resident in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) emerging as important factors in disease. In addition to an holdase function, some members catalyse disulfide bond formation and isomerization, a crucial step for native folding and prevention of aggregation of misfolded proteins. PDIs are characterized by a modular arrangement of thioredoxin-like domains, with the canonical, first identified PDIA1, organized as four thioredoxin-like domains forming a horseshoe with two active sites at the extremities. Using two fluorescent redox sensors, roGFP2 and HyPer, as client substrates either unfolded or native, and the in vitro reconstitution of the full pathways of oxidative protein in the ER, we clarified important aspects underlying the catalytic cycle of PDIA1. The N-terminal a active site is the main oxidant of thiols and can transfer electrons to the C-terminal a active site relying on the redox-dependent conformational flexibility of PDIA1 that allows the formation of an interdomain disulfide bond. The a active site act then as a crossing point to redirect electrons to the ER downstream oxidases or back to client proteins. The two active sites of PDIA1 work cooperatively as an interdomain redox relay that explains PDIA1 oxidative activity to form native disulfides and PDIA1 reductase activity to resolve scrambled disulfides. Moreover, this mechanism reveals a new rational for shutting down oxidative protein folding under ER redox imbalance or when the levels of unfolded proteins and folding intermediates exceed the folding capacity of the system.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivePeripheral nerve interfaces have the potential to restore sensory, motor, and visceral functions. In particular, intraneural interfaces allow targeting deep neural structures with high selectivity, even if their performance strongly depends upon the implantation procedure and the subjects anatomy. Currently, few alternatives exist for the determination of the target subject structural and functional anatomy, and statistical characterizations from cadaveric samples are limited because of their high cost. We propose an optimization workflow that can guide both the pre-surgical planning and the determination of maximally selective multisite stimulation protocols for implants consisting of several intraneural electrodes, and we characterize its performance in silico. We show that the availability of structural and functional information leads to very high performances and allows taking informed decisions on neuroprosthetic design.\n\nApproachWe employ hybrid models (HMs) of neuromodulation in conjunction with a machine learning-based surrogate model to determine fiber activation under electrical stimulation, and two steps of optimization through particle swarm optimization (PSO) to optimize in silico implant geometry, implantation and stimulation protocols using morphological data from the human median nerve at a reduced computational cost.\n\nMain resultsOur method allows establishing the optimal geometry of multi-electrode transverse intra-fascicular multichannel electrode (TIME) implants, the optimal number of electrodes to implant, their optimal insertion, and a set of multipolar stimulation protocols that lead in silico to selective activation of all the muscles innervated by the human median nerve.\n\nSignificanceWe show how to use effectively HMs for optimizing personalized neuroprostheses for motor function restoration. We provide in-silico evidences about the potential of multipolar stimulation to increase greatly selectivity. We also show that the knowledge of structural and functional anatomies of the target subject leads to very high selectivity and motivate the development of methods for their in vivo characterization.",

Live imaging of tumor-derived spheroids spreading on gridded micro patterns mimicking the brain vasculature recapitulated 3D motility features observed in brain or 3D matrices. Using patient-derived samples coupled with a semi-automated macro suite, SP2G easily characterized and sorted differences in cell migration and motility modes. Moreover, SP2G exposed the hidden intra-patient heterogeneity in cell motility that correlated molecularly to specific integrins. Thus, SP2G constitute a versatile and potentially pan-cancer workflow to identify the diverse invasive tumor sub-populations in patient-derived specimens.

    "abstract": "Memory engrams are both necessary and sufficient to mediate behavioral outputs. Defensive behaviors such as freezing and avoidance are commonly examined during hippocampal-mediated fear engram reactivation, yet how reactivation of these cellular populations across different contexts engages the brain to produce a variety of defensive behaviors is relatively unclear. To address this, we first optogenetically reactivated a tagged fear engram in the dentate gyrus (DG) subregion of the hippocampus across three distinct contexts. We found that there were differential amounts of light-induced freezing depending on the size of the context in which reactivation occurred: mice demonstrated robust light-induced freezing in the most spatially restricted of the three contexts but not in the largest. We then utilized graph theoretical analyses to identify brain-wide alterations in cFos co-activation during engram reactivation across the smallest and largest contexts. Our manipulations conferred greater positive cFos correlations and recruited regions spanning putative fear and defense systems as hubs in the respective networks. Moreover, reactivating DG-mediated engrams generated network topologies across experimental conditions, emphasizing both shared and distinct features. By identifying and manipulating the circuits supporting memory function, as well as their corresponding brain-wide activity patterns, it is thereby possible to resolve systems-level biological mechanisms mediating memorys capacity to modulate behavioral states.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTImplementing appropriate defensive behaviors across disparate environments is essential for survival. Memories can be used to select these responses. Recent work identified and artificially manipulated cellular ensembles within the hippocampus that mediate fear memory recall, yet how these populations engage brain-wide pathways that mediate defensive behaviors under environmental contingencies is unclear. We demonstrated here that reactivation across environments of various sizes elicits different behavioral responses and corresponding brain-wide network dynamics. These findings establish the flexibility of memory-bearing ensembles in generating brain and behavior states.",

    "abstract": "The adoption of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has steadily increased in research as a tool capable to safely and non-invasively stimulate both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Initial clinical applications were limited to diagnostic use of TMS and readout signals such as electromyograms (EMG). Subsequently, repetitive TMS (rTMS) was appreciated for its therapeutics benefits as well. However, even after a decade of use of rTMS as an alternative treatment of major depression disorder in psychiatry, the mechanism of action is still not well understood. Computer models predicting the induced electric field distribution in the brain have been suggested before in the hope to resolve at least some of the uncertainty and resulting variable treatment response associated with the clinical use of TMS.\n\nWe constructed a finite element model (FEM) of the head using individual volumetric tissue meshes obtained from an MRI scan and a detailed model of a TMS coil that together can predict the current induced in the head of a patient at any given location with any given coil position and orientation. We further designed several potential metrics of how a TMS induced current induced neuronal activation in the motor cortex, and added this to the model. We validated this model with motor evoked potentials (MEPs), EMG responses of the hand muscles after TMS on the motor cortex, in an experiment on 9 healthy subjects. We adopted a tailored MEP mapping protocol for model validation, which unlike traditional grid mappings, varies the TMS machine output intensity between stimulation locations. We further varied coil orientation on each point stimulated to allow exploration of the angular dependency of the model MEPs. Taken together, this approach covers a wide domain and scope of the modeled and measured responses, which are optimally suited for model validation. For each subject the motor hotspot was carefully identified using individual cortical anatomy and BOLD fMRI measurements.\n\nModeled activation in the motor cortex did not show a good correlation to the observed magnitude of the observed MEPs, for none of the neuronal activation metrics adopted. For an activation metric that was asymmetric, taking into account induced current direction with respect to the motor cortex sulcal wall, was marginally better than other metrics. Generally all activation metrics based on induced currents performed better than a control metric agnostic of induced electric field magnitude. Our results suggest that one should take into account components of the injected currents and their relationship to the morphology of the underlying motor cortex, but the coarse metrics we used to model the relationship between induced current and neuronal activation probably did not do justice to the complex neuronal circuitry of the cortical sheet. Furthermore, it seemed MEP magnitudes in our experiment are too variable over subsequent stimulations, which could be mitigated by more repetitions per stimulation location and orientation.\n\nFurther efforts to construct validated models predicting TMS effects in individual patients brains should incorporate microcircuits interactions in the cortical sheet, in addition to induced electrical field models, and take into account inherent trial to trial variability of MEPs.",

    "abstract": "Macrophages are essential cells of the immune system that alter their inflammatory profile depending on their microenvironment. Alternative polyadenylation in the 3UTR (3UTR-APA) and intronic polyadenylation (IPA) are mechanisms that modulate gene expression, in particular in cancer and activated immune cells. Yet, how polarization and colorectal cancer (CRC) cells microenvironment affect 3UTR-APA and IPA in primary human macrophages remains unknown. Here, primary human monocytes were isolated from healthy donors, differentiated and polarized into a pro-inflammatory state and ChrRNA-Seq and 3RNA-Seq were performed to quantify gene expression and characterize new 3UTR-APA and IPA mRNA isoforms. Our results show that polarization of human macrophages from naive to a pro-inflammatory state causes a marked increase both in proximal polyA site selection in the 3UTR and in IPA events, in genes relevant for macrophage functions. Additionally, we found a negative correlation between differential gene expression and IPA during pro-inflammatory polarization of primary human macrophages. As macrophages are abundant immune cells in the CRC microenvironment that either promote or abrogate cancer progression, we investigated how indirect exposure to CRC cells affects macrophage gene expression and 3UTR-APA and IPA mRNA events. Co-culture with CRC cells alters the inflammatory phenotype of macrophages, increases the expression of pro-tumoral genes and induce 3UTR-APA alterations. Notably, some of these gene expression differences were also found in tumour-associated macrophages of CRC patients, indicating that they are physiological relevant. Upon macrophage pro-inflammatory polarization SRSF12 is the pre-mRNA processing gene that is most upregulated. After SRSF12 knockdown in M1 macrophages there is a global downregulation of gene expression, in particular in genes involved in gene expression regulation and in immune responses. Our results reveal new 3UTR-APA and IPA mRNA isoforms produced during pro-inflammatory polarization of primary human macrophages and CRC co-culture that may be used in the future as diagnostic or therapeutic tools.",

    "abstract": "Despite their central role in transcription, it has been difficult to define universal sequences associated to eukaryotic promoters. Within chromatin context, recruitment of the transcriptional machinery requires opening of the promoter but how DNA elements could contribute to this process has remained elusive. Here, we show that G-quadruplex (G4) secondary structures are highly enriched mammalian core promoter elements. G4s are located at the deepest point of nucleosome exclusion at promoters and correlate with maximum promoter activity. We found that experimental G4s exclude nucleosomes both in vivo and in vitro and display a strong positioning potential. At model promoters, impairing G4s affected both transcriptional activity and chromatin opening. G4 destabilization also resulted in an inactive promoter state and affected transition to effective RNA production in live imaging experiments. Finally, G4 stabilization resulted in global reduction of proximal promoter pausing. Altogether, our data introduce G4s as bona fide promoter elements allowing nucleosome exclusion and facilitating pause release by the RNA Polymerase II.",

    "abstract": "Perceptual confidence reflects the ability to evaluate the evidence that supports perceptual decisions. It is thought to play a critical role in guiding decision-making, but only a few empirical studies have actually investigated the function of confidence. To address this issue, we designed a perceptual task in which participants provided a confidence judgment on the accuracy of their perceptual decision. Then, they viewed the response of a machine or human partner, and they were instructed to decide whether to keep or change their initial response. We observed that confidence predicted participants decision to keep or change their initial responses more than task difficulty and perceptual accuracy. This suggests that confidence, as a subjective evaluation of uncertainty, enables us to weigh our decisions, driving the interaction with a partner. Furthermore, confidence judgments could be predicted by pre-response pupil dynamics, suggesting that arousal changes are linked to confidence computations. This study contributes to our understanding of the function of confidence in decision-making and highlights the possibility of using pupil dynamics as a proxy of confidence.",

    "abstract": "Visible surface films, termed slicks, can extensively cover the sea surface, particularly in coastal regions. The sea-surface microlayer (SML), the upper 1-mm at the air-water interface in slicks (slick SML) harbors a distinctive bacterial community, but little is known about SML viruses. Using flow cytometry, metagenomics, and cultivation, we investigated viruses and the bacterial community from a brackish slick SML in comparison to non-slick SML as well as the seawater below (SSW). We conducted size-fractionated filtration of all samples to distinguish viral attachment to hosts and particles. The slick SML contained higher abundances of virus-like particles, prokaryotic cells, and dissolved organic carbon compared to non-slick SML and SSW. The community of 428 viral operational taxonomic units (vOTUs), 426 predicted as lytic, distinctly differed across all size fractions in the slick SML compared to non-slick SML and SSW. The distinctness was underlined by specific metabolic profiles of bacterial metagenome assembled genomes and isolates, which revealed prevalence of motility genes and diversity of CAZymes in the slick SML. Despite overall lower diversity, several vOTUs were enriched in slick SML over slick SSW. Nine vOTUs were only found in slick SML and six of them were targeted by slick SML-specific CRISPR spacers likely originating from Gammaproteobacteria. Moreover, isolation of three previously unknown lytic phages for Alishewanella sp. and Pseudoalteromonas tunicata, representing abundant and actively replicating slick SML bacteria, suggests that viral activity in slicks can contribute to biogeochemical cycling in coastal ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Vaccinia virus exiting from host cells activates Src/Abl kinases to phosphorylate A36, an integral membrane viral protein. Phosphorylated A36 binds the adaptors Nck and Grb2 which recruit N-WASP to activate Arp2/3-driven actin polymerisation to promote viral spread. A36 also recruits intersectin, which enhances actin polymerization via AP-2/clathrin and Cdc42. How many viral and host molecules does vaccinia hijack to induce actin polymerization? To advance our quantitative understanding of this process, we now determined absolute numbers of the essential molecules in the vaccinia signalling network using fluorescent molecule counting approaches in live cells. There are 1156{+/-}120 A36 molecules on virus particles inducing actin polymerization in HeLa cells. This number, however, is over 2000 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), suggesting that A36 levels on the virion are not fixed. In MEFs, viruses recruit 1032{+/-}200 Nck and 434{+/-}10 N-WASP molecules, suggesting a ratio of 4:2:1 for the A36:Nck:N-WASP signalling network. Loss of A36 binding to either secondary adaptors Grb2 or intersectin results in a 1.3- and 2.5-fold reduction in Nck respectively. Curiously, despite recruiting comparable numbers of the Arp2/3 activator, N-WASP (245{+/-}26 and 276{+/-}66), these mutant viruses move at different speeds that inversely correlate with the number of Nck molecules. Our analysis has uncovered two unexpected new aspects of Vaccinia virus egress, numbers of the viral protein A36 can vary in the virion membrane and the velocity of virus movement depends on the levels of the adaptor protein Nck.",

We investigated the influence of diversity on associated community function by propagating natural microbial communities from a traditionally fermented milk beverage diluted to various levels. Specifically, we assessed the influence of less abundant microbial types such as yeast and rarer bacterial types on community functionality and species sorting trajectories over approximately 100 generations. We observed repeatable changes in bacterial community compositions, metabolic profiles, and acidity related to starting diversity levels. The influence of a single ecological guild, yeast in our study, played a dramatic role on function, but interestingly not on long-term species sorting trajectories of the remaining bacterial community. Our results together evidence ecological selection on the microbial communities in our system and suggest an unexpected niche division between yeast and bacterial communities.",

    "abstract": "Genome sequence-based identification of two strains (3986T and 51.81) isolated from rabbits in France in 1972 and 1981 and deposited in the Collection of Institut Pasteur (CIP) has led to the description of a novel species in the genus Neisseria. The cells of both strains were non-motile, Gram-stain-negative and diplococcobacilli. Optimal growth on trypticase soy agar was recorded at 37{degrees}C and pH 8.5 in aerobic conditions. Phylogeny based on 16S rRNA gene placed the strains close to Neisseria bacilliformis ATCC BAA-1200T (96.38%) nesting with the members of Neisseriaceae family. Furthermore, the phylogenetic analysis based on bac120 gene set from the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB) placed both strains within the monophyletic Neisseria clade, which also included type strains of Morococcus cerebrosus, Bergeriella denitrificans, Kingella potus, Uruburuella suis and Uruburuella testudinis. However, Neisseria shayeganii strain 871T was placed outside Neisseria clade and close to the members of Eikenella genus. Strains 3986T and 51.81 were placed in a branch distinct from all species of the genus Neisseria and exhibited the average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) values below the species demarcation values. In contrast, ANI value within the two strains was 96.9% confirming that they represent same species. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain 3986T was 56.92%. Based on the phylogenetic and phenotypic data, the strains 3986T and 51.81 represent a novel species of the genus Neisseria, for which the name Neisseria leonis sp. nov. is proposed (type strain 3986T = CIP 109994T = LMG 32907T). Additionally, based on phylogenetic analysis, DUS dialect and average amino acid identity (AAI) values, we also proposed the reclassification of Morococcus cerebrosus, Bergeriella denitrificans, Kingella potus, Uruburuella suis and Uruburuella testudinis into Neisseria genus and Neisseria shayeganii into Eikenella genus.\n\nAuthor NotesThe GenBank accession numbers for the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strains 3986T and 51.81 are respectively OQ121838.1 and OQ428162.1.

    "abstract": "Ecological interactions may fuel phenotypic diversification in sympatric species. While competition can enhance trait divergence, other ecological interactions may promote convergence in sympatric species. Within butterflies, evolutionary convergences in wing color patterns have been reported between distantly-related species, especially in females from palatable species, where mimetic color patterns are promoted by predator communities shared with defended species living in sympatry. Wing color patterns are also often involved in species recognition in butterflies, and divergence in this trait has been reported in closely-related species living in sympatry as a result of reproductive character displacement. Here we investigate the effect of sympatry between species on the convergence vs. divergence of their wing color patterns in relation to phylogenetic distance, focusing on the iconic swallowtail butterflies (family Papilionidae). We developed a new unsupervised machine-learning-based method to estimate phenotypic distances among wing color patterns from 337 species allowing to finely quantify morphological diversity at global scale within and among species, allowing to compute pairwise phenotypic distances between sympatric and allopatric species pairs. We found that sympatry promoted strong convergence, while divergence in sympatry was less frequent and weaker. The effect of sympatry on convergence was stronger on females than males, suggesting that differential selective pressures acting on the two sexes drove sexual dimorphism. Our results highlight the significant effect of ecological interactions driven by predation pressures on trait diversification in Papilionidae and evidence the interaction between phylogenetic proximity and ecological interactions in sympatry acting on macroevolutionary patterns of phenotypic diversification.",

Don) is the most important Japanese forest tree, occupying about 44% of artificial forests in Japan, and planted in East Asia, Azores Archipelago, and some islands in the Indian Ocean. Although the huge genome of the species (ca. 11 Gb) with abundant repeat elements might have been an obstacle for genetic analysis, the species is easily propagated by cutting, flowered by plant hormones like gibberellic acid, transformed by agrobacterium, and edited by CRISPR/Cas9. These characteristics of C. japonica are preferable to make the species a model conifer for which reference genome sequences are necessary. In this study, we report the first chromosome-level assembly for C. japonica (2n = 22) using a third generation selfed progeny with an estimated homozygosity of 0.96. Young leaf tissue was used to extract high-molecular-weight DNA (>50 kb) for HiFi PacBio long read sequencing and to construct Hi-C/Omni-C library for Illumina short read sequencing. Using the 29x and 26x genome coverage of HiFi and Illumina reads, respectively, de novo assembly resulted in 2,650 contigs (9.1 Gb in total) with N50 contig size of 12.0 Mb. The Hi-C analysis mapped 97% of the nucleotides on the 11 chromosomes. The assembly was verified by comparing with a consensus linkage map of 7,785 markers. The BUSCO analysis confirmed ~91% of conserved genes.

    "abstract": "Diffuse midline glioma (DMG) is a leading cause of brain tumor death in children. In addition to hallmark H3.3K27M mutations, significant subsets also harbor alterations of other genes, such as TP53 and PDGFRA. Despite the prevalence of H3.3K27M, the results of clinical trials in DMG have been mixed, possibly due to the lack of models recapitulating its genetic heterogeneity. To address this gap, we developed human iPSC-derived tumor models harboring TP53R248Q with or without heterozygous H3.3K27M and/or PDGFRAD842V overexpression. The combination of H3.3K27M and PDGFRAD842V resulted in more proliferative tumors when gene-edited neural progenitor (NP) cells were implanted into mouse brains compared to NP with either mutation alone. Transcriptomic comparison of tumors and their NP cells of origin identified conserved JAK/STAT pathway activation across genotypes as characteristic of malignant transformation. Conversely, integrated genome-wide epigenomic and transcriptomic analyses, as well as rational pharmacologic inhibition, revealed targetable vulnerabilities unique to the TP53R248Q; H3.3K27M; PDGFRAD842V tumors and related to their aggressive growth phenotype. These include AREG-mediated cell cycle control, altered metabolism, and vulnerability to combination ONC201/trametinib treatment. Taken together, these data suggest that cooperation between H3.3K27M and PDGFRA influences tumor biology, underscoring the need for better molecular stratification in DMG clinical trials.",

However, current enzyme assay technologies are limited by an inability to simultaneously resolve both stability and activity phenotypes and to couple these to gene sequences at large scale. Here we developed Enzyme Proximity Sequencing (EP-Seq), a deep mutational scanning method that leverages peroxidase-mediated radical labeling with single cell fidelity to dissect the effects of thousands of mutations on stability and catalytic activity of oxidoreductase enzymes in a single experiment. We used EP-Seq to analyze how 6,387 missense mutations influence folding stability and catalytic activity in a D-amino acid oxidase (DAOx) from R. gracilis. The resulting datasets demonstrate activity-based constraints that limit folding stability during natural evolution, and identify hotspots distant from the active site as candidates for mutations that improve catalytic activity without sacrificing stability. EP-Seq can be extended to other enzyme classes and provides valuable insights into biophysical principles governing enzyme structure and function.",

    "abstract": "Increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents a global healthcare threat. Methods for rapid selection of optimal antibiotic treatment are urgently needed to decrease the spread of AMR and associated mortality. The use of machine learning (ML) techniques based on genomic data to predict resistance phenotypes serves as a solution for the acceleration of the clinical response prior to phenotypic testing. Nonetheless, many existing ML methods lack interpretability and do not implicitly incorporate visualization of the sequence space that can be useful for extracting insightful patterns from genomic data. Herein, we present a methodology for AMR prediction and visualization of sequence space based on the non-linear dimensionality reduction method {square} generative topographic mapping (GTM). This approach applied to data on AMR of >5000 S. aureus isolates retrieved from the PATRIC database yielded GTM models with reasonable accuracy for all drugs (balanced accuracy values [&ge;]0.75). The GTMs represent data in the form of illustrative 2D maps of the genomic space and allow for antibiotic-wise comparison of resistance phenotypes. In addition to that, the maps were found to be useful for the analysis of genetic determinants responsible for drug resistance based on the data from the PATRIC database. Overall, the GTM-based methodology is a useful tool for the illustrative exploration of the genomic sequence space and modelling AMR and can be used as a tool complementary to the existing ML methods for AMR prediction.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7101559",

    "abstract": "Epithelial cells are highly interconnected, whereby they acquire mesoscale mechanical properties to accomplish specific tissue functions. In homeostasis, these mechanical features can be summarised as mechanical homeostasis, regulated by the balance of intercellular tension and extracellular matrix adhesion forces. In the outer retina, the significance of these forces in defining its mechanical homeostasis and vision remains poorly understood. The retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) is located at the base of the retina and supports vision by ensuring the light sensitivity and lifespan of photoreceptor cells. Due to different photoreceptor densities, this functional demand on the RPE varies from the most illuminated macula to the less illuminated retinal periphery and corresponds to a significant difference in monolayer organisation. In this work, we hypothesised that extracellular matrix cues define the relation between RPE organisation, mechanical status and functional demand. We found that the density of basement membrane laminin alpha 5 modulates RPE contractility levels which directly control the epithelium efficiency in phagocyting photoreceptor outer segments. In vivo, laminin alpha 5 density gradient follows retinal functional demand, thus supporting the physiological role of laminin alpha 5 in controlling RPE mechanical homeostasis. ECM-defined mechanical status of the RPE provides a novel parameter to consider for visual function and opens new paths of investigation for sight-threatening diseases such as high myopia and age-related macular degeneration.",

    "abstract": "High-risk neuroblastoma remains a clinically challenging childhood tumor with a 5-year survival of only 50%. Tumors overexpressing N-MYC or c-MYC oncoproteins define a group of MYC-driven high-risk neuroblastoma with the most dismal outcomes, mainly caused by treatment failure due to the emergence and regrowth of multidrug-resistant cancer cells. Specific mitochondrial processes have been implicated in the maintenance of aggressive stem-like phenotypes in various cancers. We have recently identified a novel mitochondria-mediated mechanism of neuroblastoma multidrug resistance. However, the potential of pharmacological targeting of mitochondria to overcome therapy resistance and stemness in neuroblastoma remains unclear. Here, we show that c-MYC/N-MYC-driven multidrug-resistant neuroblastoma cells are highly vulnerable to cell death induced by the inhibition of mitochondrial translation. In contrast with normal fibroblasts, doxycycline (DOXY)-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial ribosomes efficiently impaired the survival of neuroblastoma cells regardless of their multidrug resistance and stem-like phenotypes. Mechanistically, inhibiting mitochondrial translation induced the mitochondrial stress-activated integrated stress response (ISR) via the OMA1-eIF2 axis, which preceded neuroblastoma cell death. Strikingly, several oncoproteins associated with poor neuroblastoma prognosis, including c-MYC and N-MYC, were markedly downregulated upon ISR activation. Comparing models of various neuroectodermal tumors and normal fibroblasts, we identified high levels of phosphorylated c-MYC and N-MYC (indicating their activity and rapid turnover) as a factor that predetermines susceptibility of neuroblastoma cells to DOXY-induced cell death. Neuroblastoma cells failed to develop significant DOXY resistance over a long-term repeated (pulsed) selection pressure, further demonstrating mitochondrial protein balance as a clinically relevant vulnerability of cancer cells that rely on high MYC activity. Together, our findings provide insight into mitochondrial retrograde regulatory networks in the context of MYC dependence and demonstrate the mitochondrial translation machinery as a promising therapeutic target in multidrug-resistant MYC-driven neuroblastoma.",

    "abstract": "Aims/HypothesisInsulin resistance and blunted mitochondrial capacity in skeletal muscle are often synonymous; however, this association remains controversial. The aim of this study was to perform an in-depth multi-factorial comparison of skeletal muscle mitochondrial capacity between individuals who were lean and active (Active), individuals with obesity (Obese) and individuals with Obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D).\n\nMethodsSkeletal muscle biopsies were obtained from the Vastus Lateralis of individuals who were lean and active (Active- n = 9), individuals with obesity (Obese- n = 9) and individuals with obesity insulin resistance and T2D (T2D- n =22) in this cross-sectional design. Mitochondrial capacity was assessed by ex vivo mitochondrial respiration with fatty-acid and glycolytic supported protocols adjusted for mitochondrial content (mtDNA and citrate synthase activity). Supercomplex assembly was measured by BN-PAGE and immunoblot. TCA cycle intermediates were assessed with targeted metabolomics. Exploratory transcriptomics and DNA methylation analyses were performed to uncover molecular differences affecting mitochondrial function among the three groups.\n\nResultsActive had greater mitochondrial capacity compared to both Obese and T2D for ex vivo mitochondrial respiration with fatty-acid and glycolytic supported protocols adjusted for mitochondrial content (P < 0.05). Complex IV supercomplex assembley was greater in Active compared to Obese and T2D (P < 0.05) whereas Complex I and III supercomplex assembly was greater in Active compared to T2D only (P < 0.05). TCA cycle intermediates; citrate, succinate, fumarate and malate were all significantly greater in Active compared to Obese and T2D (P < 0.05). Strikingly, Obese and T2D do not differ in any of the skeletal muscle mitochondrial measurements. Active had an upregulation of genes related to respiration/mitochondrial capacity compared to both Obese and T2D. Transcriptional differences between Obese and T2D were not driven by mitochondrial related process. Active had reduced methylation correlated with increased gene expression for important mitochondrial-related genes, including ATP5PD and MFN2.\n\nConclusions/InterpretationsWe reveal no discernable differences in skeletal muscle mitochondrial content, mitochondrial capacity and mitochondrial molecular profiles between obese individuals with and without T2D that had comparable levels of confounding factors (BMI, age, aerobic capacity) that affect mitochondrial capacity. We highlight that lean, active individuals have enhanced skeletal muscle mitochondrial capacity that is also reflected at the level of DNA methylation and gene transcription. The collective observation of comparable muscle mitochondrial capacity in individuals with obesity and T2D (vs. individuals without T2D) underscores a dissociation from skeletal muscle insulin resistance.\n\nClinical trial numberNCT0191110",

While microbial dispersal (including the emigration and immigration process) constitutes an important ecological process, the coupling effects of dispersal and microbial competition in microbial diversity are poorly understood. Here, we investigated how microbial dispersal affects the diversity of microbial communities in the presence of inter-species competition, using a generalized Lotka-Volterra model in combination with experimental investigations. Our model shows that emigration reduces the diversity induced by immigration at low immigration rates. We surprisingly find that it increases the diversity of the community when the immigration rates cross a defined threshold, which we identified as Ineutral. We also found that at high immigration rates, emigration weakens the relative abundance of fast-growing species, and thus enhances the mass effect and increases the diversity. We experimentally confirmed this finding using cocultures of 20 bacterial strains isolated from the soil. Our model further showed that Ineutral exists over a wide range of species pool sizes, growth rates, and interspecies interactions, and decreases with the increasing of species pool size, growth rate, and interspecies interaction. Our work deepens the understanding of the effects of dispersal on diversity of natural communities.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in experimental techniques have enabled simultaneous recordings from thousands of neurons, enabling the study of functional cell assemblies. However, determining the patterns of synaptic connectivity giving rise to these assemblies remains challenging. To address this, we developed a complementary, simulation-based approach, using a detailed, large-scale cortical network model. Using a combination of established methods we detected functional cell assemblies from the stimulus-evoked spiking activity of 186,665 neurons. We studied how the structure of synaptic connectivity underlies assembly composition, quantifying the effects of thalamic innervation, recurrent connectivity, and the spatial arrangement of synapses on den-drites. We determined that these features reduce up to 30%, 22%, and 10% of the uncertainty of a neuron belonging to an assembly. The detected assemblies were activated in a stimulus-specific sequence and were grouped based on their position in the sequence. We found that the different groups were affected to different degrees by the structural features we considered. Additionally, connectivity was more predictive of assembly membership if its direction aligned with the temporal order of assembly activation, if it originated from strongly interconnected populations, and if synapses clustered on dendritic branches. In summary, reversing Hebbs postulate, we showed how cells that are wired together, fire together, quantifying how connectivity patterns interact to shape the emergence of assemblies. This includes a qualitative aspect of connectivity: not just the amount, but also the local structure matters; from the subcellular level in the form of dendritic clustering to the presence of specific network motifs. This connectivity-based characterization of cell assemblies creates an opportunity to study plasticity at the assembly level, and beyond strictly pairwise interactions.",

    "abstract": "Plasticity of principal cells and inhibitory interneurons underlies hippocampal memory. Bidirectional modulation of somatostatin cell mTORC1 activity, a crucial translational control mechanism in synaptic plasticity, causes parallel changes in hippocampal CA1 somatostatin interneuron (SOM-IN) long-term potentiation and hippocampus-dependent memory, indicating a key role in learning. However, SOM-IN activity changes and behavioral correlates during learning, and the role of mTORC1 in these processes, remain ill-defined. To address these questions, we used two-photon Ca2+ imaging from SOM-INs during a virtual reality goal-directed spatial memory task in head-fixed control mice (SOM-IRES-Cre mice) or in mice with conditional knockout of Rptor (SOM-Rptor-KO mice) to block mTORC1 activity in SOM-INs. We found that control mice learn the task, but SOM-Raptor-KO mice exhibit a deficit. Also, SOM-IN Ca2+ activity became increasingly related to reward localization during learning in control mice but not in SOM-Rptor-KO mice. Four types of SOM-IN activity patterns related to reward location were observed, \"reward off sustained\", \"reward off transient\", \"reward on sustained\" and \"reward on transient\", and these responses showed global remapping after reward relocation in control but not SOM-Rptor-KO mice. Thus, SOM-INs develop mTORC1-dependent spatial coding related to learning reward localization. This coding may bi-directionally interact with pyramidal cells and other structures to represent and consolidate reward location.",

    "abstract": "Progranulin (PGRN) is a lysosomal protein implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases. Over 70 mutations discovered in the GRN gene all result in reduced expression of PGRN protein. However, the detailed molecular function of PGRN within lysosomes and the impact of PGRN deficiency on lysosomal biology remain unclear. Here we leveraged multifaceted proteomic techniques to comprehensively characterize how PGRN deficiency changes the molecular and functional landscape of neuronal lysosomes. Using lysosome proximity labeling and immuno-purification of intact lysosomes, we characterized lysosome compositions and interactomes in both human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived glutamatergic neurons (i3Neurons) and mouse brains. Using dynamic stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (dSILAC) proteomics, we measured global protein half-lives in i3Neurons for the first time and characterized the impact of progranulin deficiency on neuronal proteostasis. Together, this study indicated that PGRN loss impairs the lysosomes degradative capacity with increased levels of v-ATPase subunits on the lysosome membrane, increased catabolic enzymes within the lysosome, elevated lysosomal pH, and pronounced alterations in neuron protein turnover. Collectively, these results suggested PGRN as a critical regulator of lysosomal pH and degradative capacity, which in turn influences global proteostasis in neurons. The multi-modal techniques developed here also provided useful data resources and tools to study the highly dynamic lysosome biology in neurons.",
