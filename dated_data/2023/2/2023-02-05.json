    "abstract": "Introductory paragraphThe clinical success of targeted cancer therapy is limited by drug resistance that renders cancers lethal in patients1-4. Human tumours can evolve therapy resistance by acquiring de novo genetic alterations and increased heterogeneity via mechanisms that remain incompletely understood1. Here, through parallel analysis of human clinical samples, tumour xenograft and cell line models and murine model systems, we uncover an unanticipated mechanism of therapy-induced adaptation that fuels the evolution of drug resistance. Targeted therapy directed against EGFR and ALK oncoproteins in lung cancer induced adaptations favoring apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide (APOBEC)-mediated genome mutagenesis. In human oncogenic EGFR-driven and ALK-driven lung cancers and preclinical models, EGFR or ALK inhibitor treatment induced the expression and DNA mutagenic activity of APOBEC3B via therapy-mediated activation of NF-{kappa}B signaling. Moreover, targeted therapy also mediated downregulation of certain DNA repair enzymes such as UNG2, which normally counteracts APOBEC-catalyzed DNA deamination events. In mutant EGFR-driven lung cancer mouse models, APOBEC3B was detrimental to tumour initiation and yet advantageous to tumour progression during EGFR targeted therapy, consistent with TRACERx data demonstrating subclonal enrichment of APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis. This study reveals how cancers adapt and drive genetic diversity in response to targeted therapy and identifies APOBEC deaminases as future targets for eliciting more durable clinical benefit to targeted cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEukaryotes such as fungi and protists frequently accompany bacteria and archaea in microbial communities. Unfortunately, their presence is difficult to study with  shotgun metagenomic sequencing since prokaryotic signals dominate in most environments. Recent methods for eukaryotic detection use eukaryote-specific marker genes, but they do not incorporate strategies to handle the presence of eukaryotes that are not represented in the reference marker gene set, and they are not compatible with web-based tools for downstream analysis.\n\nResultsHere we present CORRAL (for Clustering{square}Of{square}Related Reference ALignments), a tool for identification of eukaryotes in shotgun metagenomic data based on alignments to eukaryote-specific marker genes and Markov clustering. Using a combination of simulated datasets, mock community standards, and large publicly available human microbiome studies, we demonstrate that our method is not only sensitive and accurate but is also capable of inferring the presence of eukaryotes notincluded in the marker gene reference, such as novel strains. Finally, we deploy CORRAL on our MicrobiomeDB.org resource, producing an atlas of eukaryotes present in various environments of the human body and linking their presence to study covariates.\n\nConclusionsCORRAL allows eukaryotic detection to be automated and carried out at scale. Implementation of CORRAL in MicrobiomeDB.org creates a running atlas of microbial eukaryotes in metagenomic studies. Since our approach is independent of the reference used, it may be applicable to other contexts where shotgun metagenomic reads are matched against redundant but non-exhaustive databases, such as identification of bacterial virulence genes or taxonomic classification of viral reads.",

    "abstract": "The planetary biosphere is powered by a suite of key metabolic innovations that emerged early in the history of life. However, it is unknown whether life has always followed the same set of strategies for performing these critical tasks. Today, microbes access atmospheric sources of bioessential nitrogen through the activities of just one family of enzymes, nitrogenases. Here, we show that the only dinitrogen reduction mechanism known to date is an ancient feature conserved from nitrogenase ancestors. We designed a paleomolecular engineering approach wherein ancestral nitrogenase genes were phylogenetically reconstructed and inserted into the genome of the diazotrophic bacterial model, Azotobacter vinelandii, enabling an integrated assessment of both in vivo functionality and purified nitrogenase biochemistry. Nitrogenase ancestors are active and robust to variable incorporation of one or more ancestral protein subunits. Further, we find that all ancestors exhibit the reversible enzymatic mechanism for dinitrogen reduction, specifically evidenced by hydrogen inhibition, that is also exhibited by extant A. vinelandii nitrogenase isozymes. Our results suggest that life may have been constrained in its sampling of protein sequence space to catalyze one of the most energetically challenging biochemical reactions in nature. The experimental framework established here is essential for probing how nitrogenase functionality has been shaped within a dynamic, cellular context to sustain a globally consequential metabolism.\n\nIMPACT STATEMENTThe enzymatic mechanism for dinitrogen reduction is an ancient feature of nitrogenases that persisted over hundreds of millions of years.",

    "abstract": "Research continues to identify genetic variation, environmental exposures, and their mixtures underlying different diseases and conditions. There is a need for screening methods to understand the molecular outcomes of such factors. Here, we investigate a highly efficient and multiplexable, fractional factorial experimental design (FFED) to study six environmental factors and four human induced pluripotent stem cell line derived differentiating human neural progenitors. We showcase the FFED coupled with RNA-sequencing to identify the effects of low-grade exposures to these environmental factors and analyse the results in the context of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We performed this after five-day exposures on differentiating human neural progenitors accompanied by a layered analytical approach and detected several convergent and divergent, gene and pathway level responses. We revealed significant upregulation of pathways related to synaptic function and lipid metabolism following lead and fluoxetine exposure, respectively. The lipid changes were validated using mass spectrometry- based metabolomics after fluoxetine exposure. Our study demonstrates that the FFED can be used for multiplexed transcriptomic analyses to detect relevant pathway-level changes in human neural development caused by low-grade environmental risk factors. Future studies will require multiple cell lines with different genetic backgrounds for characterising the effects of environmental exposures in ASD.",

    "abstract": "Germline epigenetic programming, including genomic imprinting, substantially influences offspring development. Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) plays an important role in Histone 3 Lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3)-dependent imprinting, loss of which leads to placental hyperplasia in mammalian offspring generated by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). In this study, we show that offspring from mouse oocytes lacking the Polycomb protein Embryonic Ectoderm Development (EED) were initially growth restricted, characterised by low blastocyst cell counts and substantial mid-gestational developmental delay. This initial developmental delay was followed by striking late-gestational placental hyperplasia, fetal catch-up growth and extended gestational length that culminated in offspring overgrowth. This involved remodelling of the placenta, including expansion of fetal and maternal tissues and conspicuous expansion of the glycogen enriched cell population in the junctional zone that was associated with a delay in parturition. Despite this remodelling and offspring catchup growth, fetal/placental weight ratio and fetal blood glucose levels were low indicating low placental efficiency. Genome-wide analyses identified extensive transcriptional dysregulation in affected placentas, including a range of imprinted and non-imprinted genes and increased expression of the H3K27me3-imprinted gene Slc38a4, which regulates transport of essential amino acids in the placenta. Our data provide an explanation for apparently opposing observations of growth restriction and overgrowth of offspring derived from Eed-null oocytes and demonstrate that PRC2-dependent programming in the oocyte regulates fetal and placental growth and developmental outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Paternal abuse of drugs, such as methamphetamine (METH), elevates the risk of developing addiction in subsequent generations, however, its underlying molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. Male adult mice (F0) were exposed to METH for 30 days, followed by mating with naive female mice to create the first-generation mice (F1). When growing to adulthood, F1 were subjected to conditioned place preference (CPP) test. Subthreshold dose of METH, insufficient to induce CPP normally, were used in F1 (METHF1). Selective antagonist (betaxolol) for {beta}1-adrenergic receptor (ADRB1) or its knocking-down virus were administrated into mPFC to regulate ADRB1 function and expression on CaMKII-positive neurons. METH-sired male F1 acquired METHF1-induced CPP, indicating that paternal METH exposure induce higher sensitivity to METH in male F1. Compared with saline (SAL)-sired male F1, CaMKII-positive neuronal activity was normal without METHF1, but strongly evoked after METHF1 treatment in METH-sired male F1 during adulthood. METH-sired male F1 had higher ADRB1 levels without METHF1, which was kept at higher levels after METHF1 treatment in mPFC. Either inhibiting ADRB1 function with betaxolol, or knocking-down ADRB1 level on CaMKII-positive neurons (ADRB1CaMKII) with virus transfection efficiently suppressed METHF1-evoked mPFC acyivation, and ultimately blocked METHF1-induced CPP in METH-sired male F1. In the process, the p-ERK1/2 and {Delta}FosB may be potential subsequent signals of mPFC ADRB1CaMKII. The mPFC ADRB1CaMKII mediates paternal METH exposure-induced higher sensitivity to drug addiction in male offspring, raising a promising pharmacological target for predicting or treating transgenerational addiction.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIPaternal methamphetamine (METH) exposure induces higher sensitivity to METH in male F1 during adulthood, accompanied with higher ADRB1 level in mPFC.\nC_LIO_LIMETH use in F1 (METHF1) evokes more CaMKII-positive neurons in mPFC of METH-sired than saline-sired male F1.\nC_LIO_LIInhibiting ADRB1 function or knocking-down ADRB1 level on CaMKII-positive neurons (ADRB1CaMKII) efficiently suppresses METHF1-evoked mPFC activation, and ultimately rescues transgenerational susceptibility to addiction in male F1.\nC_LI",

Current GECIs face the challenge of sub-optimal peak signal-to-baseline-ratio (SBR) with limited resolution for reporting subtle calcium transients. We report herein the development of a suite of calcium sensors, designated NEMO, with fast kinetics and wide dynamic ranges (>100-fold). NEMO indicators report Ca2+ transients with peak SBRs ~20-fold larger than the top-of-the-range GCaMP series. NEMO sensors further enable the quantification of absolution calcium concentration with ratiometric or photochromic imaging. Compared to GCaMPs, NEMOs could detect single action potentials in neurons with a peak SBR two times higher and a median peak SBR four times larger in vivo, thereby outperforming most existing state-of-the-art GECIs. Given their high sensitivity and resolution to report intracellular Ca2+ signals, NEMO sensors may find broad applications in monitoring neuronal activities and other Ca2+-modulated physiological processes in both mammals and plants.",

In this paper, we propose a novel efficient graph-based kmer embedding method, named Kmer-Node2Vec, to tackle this concern. Our method converts the large DNA corpus into one kmer co-occurrence graph and extracts kmer relation on the graph by random walks to learn fast and high-quality kmer embedding.

Xeroderris stuhlmannii (Taub.) Mendonca & E.P. Sousa (X. stuhlmannii (Taub.)) is a medicinal plant used traditionally in Zimbabwe to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its complications. However, there is no scientific evidence to support its inhibitory effect against digestive enzymes (-glucosidases) that are linked to high blood sugar in humans.\n\nAim of the study: This work aims to investigate whether bioactive phytochemicals of crude X. stuhlmannii (Taub.) can scavenge free radicals and inhibit -glucosidases in order to reduce blood sugar in humans.\n\nMaterials and methodsHere we examined the free radical scavenging potential of crude aqueous, ethyl acetate and methanolic extracts of X. stuhlmannii (Taub.) using the diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl assay in vitro. Furthermore, we carried out in vitro inhibition of -glucosidases (-amylase and -glucosidase) by the crude extracts using chromogenic 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid and p-nitrophenyl--D-glucopyranoside substrates. We also used molecular docking approaches (Autodock Vina) to screen for bioactive phytochemical compounds targeting the digestive enzymes.\n\nResultsOur results showed that phytochemicals in X. stuhlmannii (Taub.) aqueous, ethyl acetate and methanolic extracts scavenged free radicals with IC50 values ranging from 0.002-0.013 g/mL. Furthermore, crude aqueous, ethyl acetate and methanolic extracts significantly inhibited -amylase and -glucosidase with IC50 values of 10.5-29.5 g/mL (versus 54.1{+/-}0.7 g/mL for acarbose) and 8.8-49.5 g/mL (versus 161.4{+/-}1.8 g/mL for acarbose), respectively. In silico molecular docking findings and pharmacokinetic predictions showed that myricetin is likely a novel plant-derived -glucosidase inhibitor.\n\nConclusionCollectively, our findings suggest pharmacological targeting of digestive enzymes by X. stuhlmannii (Taub.) crude extracts may reduce blood sugar in humans with T2DM via inhibition of -glucosidases.",

    "abstract": "The Coxiellaceae family is composed of five genera showing lifestyles ranging from free-living to symbiosis. Among them, Coxiella burnetii is a well-known pathogen causing Q fever in humans. This bacterium presents both intracellular (parasitic) and environmental (resistant) forms. Recently, several environmental Coxiella genomes have been reported, among which several have come from intracellular mutualistic symbionts of ticks, termed Coxiella-like endosymbionts. We sequenced two new Coxiella-LE genomes from Dermacentor marginatus (CLEDm) and Ornithodoros maritimus (CLEOmar) ticks, the latter belonging to the C. burnetii lineage. Using these newly sequenced Coxiella-LEs and 43 Coxiellaceae genomes, we conducted comparative genomic and phylogenomic analyses to increase our knowledge of C. burnetii pathogenicity and the emergence of Coxiella-LEs. Results highlight the probably parasitic nature of the common ancestor of the Coxiellaceae. Indeed, the virulence factor Dot/Icm T4 Secretion System is present in most, but not all, Coxiellaceae. Whereas it is part of a putative pathogenic island in C. burnetii, it has been entirely lost or inactivated in Coxiella-LEs, suggesting its importance in pathogenesis. Additionally, we found that a Sha/Mrp antiporter was laterally acquired in the C. burnetii lineage. This antiporter might be involved in alkali resistance and the development of the resistant form that is able to persist in the environment for long periods of time. The Sha operon is eroded or absent in Coxiella-LEs. Finally, we found that all Coxiella representatives produce B vitamins and co-factors indicating a pre-adaptation of Coxiella to mutualism with hematophagous arthropods. Accordingly, the ancestor of C. burnetii and Coxiella-LEs was likely a parasitic bacterium able to manipulate its host cell and to produce vitamins and co-factors for its own use.",

    "abstract": "We have studied adenosine binding specificities of two bacterial DNA methyltransferase Taq methyltransferase (M.TaqI), and HhaI methyltransferase (M.HhaI). While these DNA methyltransferases have similar cofactor binding pocket interactions, experimental data showed different specificity for novel cofactors ((SNM) (S-guanosyl-L-methionine (SGM), S-cytidyl-L-methionine (SCM), S-uridyl-L-methionine (SUM)). Protein dynamics corroborate the experimental data on the cofactor specificities. For M.TaqI the specificity for S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) is governed by the tight binding on the nucleoside part of the cofactor, while for M.HhaI the degree of freedom of the nucleoside chain allows the acceptance of other bases. The experimental data proves a catalytically productive methylation by M.HhaI binding pocket for all the SNM. Our results suggest a new route for successful design of unnatural SNM analogues for methyltransferases as a tool for cofactor engineering.\n\nTable of Content\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=82 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/513954v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (15K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2562aforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@71de9forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cead77org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1de8682_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG TOC: Methylation by DNA methyltransferase is nucleobase dependent.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONAlzheimers Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition associated with extra- and intraneuronal accumulation of two misfolded proteins, namely Amyloid-Beta (A{beta}) and tau. In this paper, we study the effect of these proteins on neuronal activity, with the aim of assessing their individual and combined impact on neuronal processes.\n\nMETHODSThe technique uses a whole-brain dynamic model to find the optimal parameters that best describe the effects of A{beta} and tau on the excitation-inhibition balance of the local nodes.\n\nRESULTSOur experimental results show a clear dominance of the neuronal activity of A{beta} over tau in the early disease stages (Mild Cognitive Impairment), while tau dominates over A{beta} in the latest stages (AD). Our findings identify a crucial role for A{beta} and tau in contributing to complex neuronal dynamics and demonstrate the viability of using regional distributions of neuropathology to define models of large-scale brain function in AD.\n\nDISCUSSIONOur study provides further insight into the dynamics and complex interplay between these two proteins among themselves and with the regional neural activity, opening the path for further investigations on biomarkers and candidate therapeutic targets in-silico.",

    "abstract": "Camponotus floridanus ants show altered behaviors followed by a fatal summiting phenotype when infected with manipulating Ophiocordyceps camponoti-floridani fungi. Host summiting as a strategy to increase transmission is also observed with parasite taxa beyond fungi, including aquatic and terrestrial helminths and baculoviruses. The drastic phenotypic changes can sometimes reflect significant physiological changes within host cells that span molecular levels from metabolites to nucleic acids. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms still need to be fully characterized. To investigate the small molecules producing summiting behavior, we infected C. floridanus ants with O. camponoti-floridani and sampled their heads for LC-MS/MS when we observed the characteristic summiting phenotype. We link this metabolomic data with our previous genomic and transcriptomic data to propose mechanisms that underlie manipulated summiting behavior in \"zombie ants.\" This \"multiomic\" evidence points toward the dysregulation of neurotransmitter levels and neuronal signaling. We propose that these processes are altered during infection and manipulation based on 1) differential expression of neurotransmitter synthesis and receptor genes, 2) altered abundance of metabolites and neurotransmitters (or their precursors) with known behavioral effects in ants and other insects, and 3) possible suppression of a connected immunity pathway. We additionally report signals for metabolic activity during manipulation related to primary metabolism, detoxification, and anti-stress protectants.",

The proposed analytical model identifies patient and tumor-specific APEs with as few as 20 labeled data points. Additionally, the proposed data structure employs complex network theory and other statistical approaches that can better explain and reduce the black box effect of deep learning. The proposed approach achieves an F1-score of 80% and 93% on patients one and two respectively and above 90% on tumor-specific tasks.

    "abstract": "Dravet syndrome (Dravet) is a severe congenital developmental genetic epilepsy caused by de novo mutations in the SCN1A gene. Nonsense mutations are found in ~20% of the patients, and the R613X mutation was identified in multiple patients. Here we characterized the epileptic and non-epileptic comorbidities of a novel preclinical Dravet mouse model harboring this nonsense Scn1a mutation. Heterozygous Scn1a R613X mutation on a mixed C57BL/6J:129S1/SvImJ background exhibited spontaneous seizures, susceptibility to heat-induced seizures, and premature mortality, recapitulating the core epileptic phenotypes of Dravet. In addition, these mice, available as an open-access model, demonstrated increased locomotor activity in the open-field test, mimicking some non-epileptic Dravet-associated comorbidities. Conversely, Scn1aWT/R613X mice on the pure 129S1/SvImJ background had a normal life span and were easy to breed. Homozygous Scn1aR613X/R613X mice died before P16.\n\nOur molecular analyses of hippocampal and cortical expression demonstrated that the premature stop codon induced by the R613X mutation reduced Scn1a mRNA and Nav1.1 protein levels to ~50% in heterozygous Scn1aWT/R613X mice, with marginal expression in homozygous Scn1aR613X/R613X mice. Together, we introduce a novel Dravet model carrying the R613X Scn1a nonsense mutation that can. be used to study the molecular and neuronal basis of Dravet, as well as the development of new therapies associated with SCN1A nonsense mutations in Dravet.",

    "abstract": "Maternal behaviours, which are crucial for the survival of mammalian infants1, can be learned2,3. How the efficient acquisition of these behaviours is implemented at the neural circuitry level remains poorly understood. Although prevalent models of neural circuits for parental behaviours often assume the frontal cortical network as an integrator of infant-related sensory signals and a controller of decision-making and motivation1,4, these ideas have not been functionally tested. As such, detailed input/output neural circuit organizations of the frontal cortex in relation to parental behaviours remain unknown. Here we show that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) promotes efficient learning of maternal behaviours in virgin female mice when they are co-housed with lactating mothers. Chronic microendoscopy in freely behaving animals reveals robust representations of pup-directed anticipatory activities and ongoing sequential motions of pup retrieval that are innately sculpted and largely unaffected by learning. Through viral tracing and manipulations, we functionally identify the submedius thalamus as a prominent presynaptic partner of the OFC that shapes pup-related representations. Optogenetic inactivation of OFC reduces the pup retrieval-related activities of midbrain dopamine neurons5,6 that promote maternal behaviours. Collectively, these findings reveal a higher-order cognitive network that connects innately formed, pup-related integrated representation to the top-down control of motivation centers, thus enabling efficient maternal behavioural learning.",

    "abstract": "Pathogen nomenclature systems are a key component of effective communication and collaboration for researchers and public health workers. Since February 2021, the Pango nomenclature for SARS-CoV-2 has been sustained by crowdsourced lineage proposals as new isolates were added to a growing global dataset. This approach to dynamic lineage designation is dependent on a large and active epidemiological community identifying and curating each new lineage. This is vulnerable to time-critical delays as well as regional and personal bias. To address these issues, we developed a simple heuristic approach that divides a phylogenetic tree into lineages based on shared ancestral genotypes. We additionally provide a framework that automatically prioritizes the lineages by growth rate and association with key mutations or locations, extensible to any pathogen. Our implementation is efficient on extremely large phylogenetic trees and produces similar results to existing Pango lineage designations when applied to SARS-CoV-2. This method offers a simple, automated and consistent approach to pathogen nomenclature that can assist researchers in developing and maintaining phylogeny-based classifications in the face of ever increasing genomic datasets.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen considerable scientific attention devoted towards documenting the presence of microplastics (MPs) in environmental samples. Due to omnipresence of environmental microplastics, however, disentangling environmental MPs from sample contamination is a challenge. Hence, the environmental (collection site and laboratory) microplastics contamination of samples during processing is a reality that we must address, in order to generate reproducible and reliable data. Here we investigated published literature and have found that around 1/5 of studies failed to use blank controls in their experiments. Additionally, only 34% of the studies used a controlled air environment for their samples processing (laminar flow, fume hood, closed laboratory, clean room, etc.). In that regard, we have also shown that preparing samples in the fume hood, leads to more microplastics contamination than preparing it in the laboratory bench and the laminar flow. Although it did not completely prevent microplastics contamination, the processing of sample inside the laminar flow is the best option to reduce sample contamination during processing. Overall, we showed that blank controls are a must in microplastics sample preparation, but it is often overlooked by researchers.\n\nHighlightsO_LIMost of the contaminant microplastics in blank controls were particles < 20 m.\nC_LIO_LIFume hoods result in more contamination than processing the samples on the bench.\nC_LIO_LILaminar flow was the best option for reducing MPs contamination of samples.\nC_LIO_LI1/5 of studies failed to use blank controls, and 1/3 did not correct their data.\nC_LIO_LIImproving the use and description of blanks is imperative for ensuring data quality.\nC_LI\n\nMandatory graphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=77 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/527118v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (44K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1de1ef4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c240cdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2c57bcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1341059_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The origin of the pentaradial body plan of echinoderms from a bilateral ancestor is one of the most enduring zoological puzzles. Since echinoderms are defined by morphological novelty, even the most basic axial comparisons with their bilaterian relatives are problematic. Here, we used conserved antero-posterior (AP) axial molecular markers to determine whether the highly derived adult body plan of echinoderms masks underlying patterning similarities with other deuterostomes. To revisit this classical question, we used RNA tomography and in situ hybridizations in the sea star Patiria miniata to investigate the expression of a suite of conserved transcription factors with well-established roles in the establishment of AP polarity in bilaterians. We find that the relative spatial expression of these markers in P. miniata ambulacral ectoderm shows similarity with other deuterostomes, with the midline of each ray representing the most anterior territory and the most lateral parts exhibiting a more posterior identity. Interestingly, there is no ectodermal territory in the sea star that expresses the characteristic bilaterian trunk genetic patterning program. This suggests that from the perspective of ectoderm patterning, echinoderms are mostly head-like animals, and prompts a reinterpretation of the evolutionary trends that made echinoderms the most derived animal group.",

    "abstract": "Green and nano-structured catalytic media are vital for bio-catalysis to attenuate the denaturation tendency of biocata-lysts under severe reaction conditions. Hydrotropes with multi-faceted physiochemical properties represent promising systems for sustainable protein packaging. Herein, the suitability of adenosine-5-triphosphate (ATP) and cholinium sa-licylate ([Cho][Sal]) ionic liquid (IL) to form nano-structures and to nano-confine Cytochrome c (Cyt c) were demonstrat-ed to enhance the stability and activity under multiple stressors. Experimental and computational analyses were under-taken to explain the nano-structured phenomenon of ATP and IL, structural organizations of nano-confined Cyt c, and site-specific interactions that stabilize the protein structure. Both ATP and IL form nano-structures in aqueous media and could cage Cyt c via multiple nonspecific soft interactions. Remarkably, the engineered molecular nano-cages of ATP (5-10 mM), IL (300 mg/mL), and ATP+IL surrounding Cyt c resulted in 9-to-72-fold higher peroxidase activity than native Cyt c with exceptionally high thermal tolerance (110oC). The polar interactions with the cardiolipin binding site of Cyt c, mediated by hydrotropes, were well correlated with the increased peroxidase activity. Furthermore, higher activity trends were observed in the presence of urea, GuHCl, and trypsin without any protein degradation. Specific binding of hy-drotropes in highly mobile regions of Cyt c ({Omega} 40-54 residues) and enhanced H-bonding with Lys and Arg offered excel-lent stability under extreme conditions. Additionally, ATP effectively counteracted reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced denaturation of Cyt c, which was enhanced by the [Sal] counterpart of IL. Overall, this study explored the robustness of nano-structured hydrotropes to have a higher potential for protein packaging with improved stability and activity under extreme conditions. Thus, the present work highlights a novel strategy for real-time industrial bio-catalysis to protect mitochondrial cells from ROS-instigated apoptosis.\n\nSummarySuitability of ATP and [Cho][Sal] ionic liquid to form nanostructured hydrotropes and their utility in protein packaging in extreme conditions are discussed.

    "abstract": "Transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) is a powerful strategy for elucidating the molecular mechanisms behind the genetic loci of complex phenotypes. However, TWAS analysis is still daunting in many species due to the complication of the TWAS analysis pipeline, including the construction of the gene expression reference panel, gene expression prediction, and the subsequent association analysis in the large cohorts of genome-wide association study (GWAS). Farm animals are major protein sources and biomedical models for humans. To facilitate the translation of genetic findings across species, here we provide an interactive and easy-to-use multi-species TWAS web server for the entire community, called the FarmGTEx TWAS-server (http://twas.farmgtex.org), which is based on the GTEx and FarmGTEx projects. It includes gene expression data from 49, 34, and 23 tissues in 838 humans, 5,457 pigs, and 4,889 cattle, representing 38,180, 21,037, and 17,942 distinct eGenes in prediction models for humans, pigs, and cattle, respectively. It allows users to conduct gene expression prediction for any individuals with genotypes, GWAS summary statistics imputation, customized TWAS, and popular downstream functional annotation. It also provides 479,203, 1,208, and 657 tissue-gene-trait association trios for the research community, representing 1,129 human traits, 41 cattle traits, and 11 pig traits. In summary, the FarmGTEx TWAS-server is a one-stop solution for performing TWAS analysis for researchers without programming skills in both human and farm animal research communities. It will be maintained and updated timely within the FarmGTEx project to facilitate gene mapping and phenotype prediction within and across species.",

    "abstract": "Monkeypox (Mpox) is mutating at an exceptional rate for a DNA virus and its global spread is concerning, making genomic surveillance a necessity. With MpoxRadar, we provide an interactive dashboard to track virus variants on mutation level worldwide. MpoxRadar allows users to select among different genomes as reference for comparison. The occurrence of mutation profiles based on the selected reference is indicated on an interactive world map that shows the respective geographic sampling site in customizable time ranges to easily follow the frequency or trend of defined mutations. Furthermore, the user can filter for specific mutations, genes, countries, genome types, and sequencing protocols and download the filtered data directly from MpoxRadar. On the server, we automatically download all Mpox genomes and metadata from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) on a daily basis, align them with the different reference genomes, generate mutation profiles, which are stored and linked to the available metainformation in a database. This makes MpoxRadar a practical tool for the genomic survaillance of Mpox, supporting users with limited computational resources. MpoxRadar is open-source and freely accessible at https://MpoxRadar.net.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "Metastasis, the leading cause of cancer-associated deaths, is promoted by transcription factors SNAIL, SLUG, ZEB1 and TWIST through the activation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). MicroRNAs can suppress EMT, emerging as candidate molecular biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets. Herein, we evaluated microRNAs downregulated in breast cancer tissues expressing EMT transcription factors, to find new potential regulators of EMT. MiR-30a, miR-1271, miR-196a, miR-202, miR-210, miR-22, miR-331 and miR-34b were validated. Seven microRNAs downregulated luciferase activity through EMT transcription factors 3UTR, and all microRNAs decreased cell migration, invasion and/or proliferation. In MDA-MB-231 cells, miR-196a and miR-22 decreased endogenous ZEB1 levels, and miR-30a endogenous CCR7 levels. These results suggest that microRNAs studied are novel regulators of EMT through the control of SNAIL, SLUG, ZEB1 and TWIST. They also regulate the metastatic behavior of cancer cells, and may control the development of lymph node metastasis through the regulation of CCR7.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=111 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/526978v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (24K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cd3eecorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@de10fborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12d09a7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d4dc93_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInsulin-like growth factor (IGF) and other Insulin-like peptides (ilps) are important hormones regulating growth and development in animals. Whereas most animals have a single female and male adult phenotype, in some insect species the same genome may lead to different final forms. Perhaps the best known example is the honeybee where females can either develop into queens or workers. More extreme forms of such polyphenism occur in termites, where queens, kings, workers and soldiers coexist. Both juvenile hormone and insulin-like peptides are known to regulate growth and reproduction as well as polyphenism. In termites the role of juvenile hormone in reproduction and the induction of the soldier caste is well known, but the role of IGF and other ilps in these processes remains largely unknown. Here the various termite ilps are identified and hypotheses regarding their functions suggested.\n\nMethodsGenome assemblies and transcriptome short read archives (SRAs) were used to identify insulin-like peptides and neuropeptides in termites and to determine their expression in different species, tissues and castes.\n\nResults and DiscussionTermites have seven different ilps, i.e. gonadulin, IGF and an ortholog of Drosophila insulin-like peptide 7 (dilp7), which are commonly present in insects, and four smaller peptides, that have collectively been called short IGF-related peptides (sirps) and individually atirpin, birpin, cirpin and brovirpin. Gonadulin is lost from the higher termites which have however amplified the brovirpin gene, of which they often have two or three paralogs. Based on differential expression of these genes it seems likely that IGF is a growth hormone and atirpin an autocrine tissue factor that is released when a tissue faces metabolic stress. Birpin seems to be responsible for growth and in the absence of juvenile hormone this may lead to reproductive adults or, when juvenile hormone is present, to soldiers. Brovirpin is expressed both by the brain and the ovary and likely stimulates vitellogenesis, while the function of cirpin is less clear.",

By temporal profiling and gene regulatory analysis, we build a developmental trajectory of CA1 pyramidal neurons derived from multiple predecessor lineages and elucidate gene regulatory networks underlying their fate determination. With EPO as tool, we discover novel populations of newly differentiating pyramidal neurons, overpopulating to [~]200% upon rhEPO with upregulation of genes crucial for neurodifferentiation, dendrite growth, synaptogenesis, memory formation, and cognition. Using a Cre-based approach to visually distinguish pre-existing from newly formed pyramidal neurons for patch-clamp recordings, we learn that rhEPO treatment differentially affects excitatory and inhibitory inputs.

    "abstract": "Any listening task, from sound recognition to sound-based communication, rests on auditory sensory memory which is known to decline in healthy ageing. However, whether this decline maps on to multiple components and stages of auditory memory remains poorly characterised. We tested ageing effects on implicit auditory memory for rapid tone-patterns in an online unsupervised longitudinal study (day 1, day 8 and 6-month sessions) including younger (aged 20-30) and older adults (aged 60-70). The test required participants to quickly respond to rapid regularly repeating patterns (REG) emerging from random sequences. Patterns were novel in most trials (REGn), but unbeknownst to the participants, a few distinct patterns reoccurred identically throughout the sessions (REGr). After correcting for processing speed, reaction times (RTs) to REGn were taken as a measure of the amount of information held in echoic and short-term memory before detecting the pattern; an RT advantage (RTA) to REGr vs REGn was expected to grow with exposure reflecting implicit long-term memory formation and retention. The results showed that older participants were slower than younger adults in detecting REGn and exhibited a smaller RTA to REGr. Computational simulations using a model of auditory sequence memory indicated that these effects reflect age-related limitations both in early and long-term memory stages. In contrast to ageing-related accelerated forgetting of verbal material, the older adults in the present experiment maintained stable memory traces (RTA) for REGr patterns up to 6 months after the first exposure. The results demonstrate that ageing is associated with reduced short-term memory and long-term memory formation for tone-patterns, but not with forgetting, even over surprisingly long timescales.",

    "abstract": "NaV1.7, a membrane-bound voltage-gated sodium channel, is preferentially expressed along primary sensory neurons, including their peripheral & central nerve endings, axons, and soma within the dorsal root ganglia and plays an integral role in amplifying membrane depolarization and pain neurotransmission. Loss- and gain-of-function mutations in the gene encoding NaV1.7, SCN9A, are associated with a complete loss of pain sensation or exacerbated pain in humans, respectively. As an enticing pain target supported by human genetic validation, many compounds have been developed to inhibit NaV1.7 but have disappointed in clinical trials. The underlying reasons are still unclear, but recent reports suggest that inhibiting NaV1.7 in central terminals of nociceptor afferents is critical for achieving pain relief by pharmacological inhibition of NaV1.7. We report for the first time that NaV1.7 mRNA is expressed in putative projection neurons (NK1R+) in the human spinal dorsal horn, predominantly in lamina 1 and 2, as well as in deep dorsal horn neurons and motor neurons in the ventral horn. NaV1.7 protein was found in the central axons of sensory neurons terminating in lamina 1-2, but also was detected in the axon initial segment of resident spinal dorsal horn neurons and in axons entering the anterior commissure. Given that projection neurons are critical for conveying nociceptive information from the dorsal horn to the brain, these data support that dorsal horn NaV1.7 expression may play an unappreciated role in pain phenotypes observed in humans with genetic SCN9A mutations, and in achieving analgesic efficacy in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive information processing, comprised of local computations and their efficient routing, is crucial for flexible brain function. Spatial attention is a quintessential example of this adaptive process. It is critical for recognizing and interacting with behaviorally relevant objects in a cluttered environment1. Object recognition is mediated by ensembles of computational units distributed across the ventral visual hierarchy. How the deployment of spatial attention aids these hierarchical computations is unclear. Based on pairwise correlation analysis, two key mechanisms have been proposed: First is an improvement in the efficacy of unique information directed from one encoding stage to another, suggested by evidence along the visual hierarchy2-6. Based on the theoretical results that even weak correlated variability can substantially limit the encoding capacity of a neuronal pool7, a second proposal is an improvement in the sensory information capacity of an encoding stage through a reduction in shared fluctuations8,9. However, pairwise analyses capture both unique and shared components of fluctuations, and therefore cannot disambiguate the proposed mechanisms. To test these proposals, it is crucial to estimate the attentional modulation of unique information flow across and shared information within the stages of the visual hierarchy. We investigated this in the multi-stage laminar network of visual area V4, an area strongly modulated by attention10-12. Using network-based statistical modeling, we estimated the strength of inter-layer information flow by measuring statistical dependencies that reflect how the cortical layers uniquely drive each others neural activity. We quantified their modulation across attention conditions (attend-in vs. attend-away) in a change detection task and found that deployment of attention indeed strengthened unique dependencies between the input and superficial layers. Using the partial information decomposition framework13,14, we estimated modulation of shared dependencies and found that they are reduced within laminar populations, specifically the putative excitatory subpopulations. Surprisingly, we found a strengthening of unique dependencies within the laminar populations, a finding not previously predicted. Crucially, these modulation patterns were also observed across behavioral outcomes (hit vs. miss) that are thought to be mediated by endogenous state fluctuations15-17. By \"decomposing\" the modulation of dependency components and in combination with prior theoretical work7, our results suggest the following computational model of optimal sensory states that are attained by either task demands or endogenous fluctuations in brain state: enhanced information flow between and improved information capacity within encoding stages.",

    "abstract": "The demand for recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) for gene therapy is expected to soon exceed current manufacturing capabilities, considering the expanding number of approved products and of pre-clinical and clinical stage studies. Current rAAV manufacturing processes have less-than-desired yields and produce a significant amount of empty capsids. Recently, FDA approved the first rAAV-based gene therapy product manufactured in the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). The BEVS technology, based on an invertebrate cell line derived from Spodoptera frugiperda, demonstrated scalable production of high volumetric titers of full capsids. In this work, we develop a mechanistic model describing the key extracellular and intracellular phenomena occurring during baculovirus infection and rAAV virion maturation in the BEVS. The predictions of the model show good agreement with experimental measurements reported in the literature on rAAV manufacturing in the BEVS, including for TwoBac, ThreeBac, and OneBac constructs. The model is successfully validated against measured concentrations of structural and non-structural protein components, and of vector genome. We carry out a model-based analysis of the process, to provide insights on potential bottlenecks that limit the formation of full capsids. The analysis suggests that vector genome amplification is the limiting step for rAAV production in TwoBac. In turn, vector genome amplification is limited by low Rep78 levels. For ThreeBac, low vector genome amplification dictated by Rep78 limitation appears even more severe than in TwoBac. Transgene expression in the insect cell during rAAV manufacturing is also found to negatively influence the final rAAV production yields.",

    "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as key regulators of cellular senescence by transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally modulating the expression of many important genes involved in senescence-associated pathways and processes. Among the different lncRNAs associated to senescence, Senescence Associated Long Non-coding RNA (SALNR) was found to be down-regulated in different cellular models of senescence. Since its release in 2015, SALNR has not been annotated in any database or public repository, and no other experimental data have been published. The SALNR sequence is located on the long arm of chromosome 10, at band 10q23.33, and it overlaps the 3 end of the HELLS gene. This investigation helped to unravel the mystery of the existence of SALNR by analyzing publicly available short- and long-read RNA sequencing data sets and RT-PCR analysis in human tissues and cell lines. Additionally, the expression of HELLS has been studied in cellular models of replicative senescence, both in silico and in vitro. Our findings, while strongly questioning the actual existence of SALNR as an independent transcript, support the expression of a predicted HELLS isoform entirely covering the SALNR genomic region. Furthermore, we observed a strong down-regulation of HELLS in senescent cells versus proliferating cells, supporting its role in the senescence and aging process.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=106 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/526712v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (36K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1178eb8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19ae822org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fe1c49org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f31ae1_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The emerging outbreak of monkeypox is closely associated with the viral infection and spreading, threatening global public health. Virus-induced cell migration facilitates viral transmission. However, high-resolution dynamics and mechanisms underlying this type of cell migration remain unclear. Here, we investigate the motility of cells infected by vaccinia virus (VACV), a close relative of monkeypox, through combining multi-omics analyses and high-resolution live-cell imaging. We find that, upon VACV infection, the epithelial cells undergo EMT-like transformation, during which they lose intercellular junctions and acquire the migratory capacity to promote viral spreading. After transformation, VACV-induced mesenchymal migration is highly dependent on the actin cytoskeleton and RhoA signaling, which is responsible for the depolymerization of robust actin stress fibers, the leading-edge protrusion formation, and the rear-edge recontraction. Our study reveals how poxviruses alter the epithelial phenotype and regulate RhoA signaling to induce fast migration, providing a unique perspective to understand the pathogenesis of poxviruses.",

    "abstract": "Proper chromosome segregation depends on establishment of bioriented kinetochore-microtubule attachments, which often requires multiple rounds of release and reattachment. Aurora B and C kinases phosphorylate kinetochore proteins to release tensionless attachments. Multiple pathways recruit Aurora B/C to the centromere and kinetochore. We studied how these pathways contribute to anaphase onset timing and correction of kinetochore-microtubule attachments in budding yeast meiosis and mitosis. We find that the pool localized by the Bub1/Bub3 pathway sets the normal duration of meiosis and mitosis, in differing ways. Our meiosis data suggests that disruption of this pathway leads to PP1 kinetochore localization, which dephosphorylates Cdc20 for premature anaphase onset. For error correction, the Bub1/Bub3 and COMA pathways are individually important in meiosis but compensatory in mitosis. Finally, we find that the haspin and Bub1/3 pathways function together to ensure error correction in mouse oogenesis. Our results suggest that each recruitment pathway localizes spatially distinct kinetochore-localized Aurora B/C pools that function differently between meiosis and mitosis.",

    "abstract": "Increasing habitat fragmentation and disturbance threaten long distance movements of ungulates. While the effects of impermeable barriers on ungulate migrations have been well researched, quantitative evidence for gradual and long-term changes of mobility in response to anthropogenic disturbance remains relatively rare.\n\nWe investigated changes in movement behavior of Mongolian gazelle Procapra gutturosa, a nomadic ungulate species native to the Mongolian steppe. Using GPS tracking data collected from 62 gazelle individuals between 2007 and 2021, we quantified 16-day displacement distances for each individual as a metric for long-distance movements. We used generalized linear mixed models, generalized additive models and additive quantile mixed models to assess how anthropogenic and environmental factors affected gazelle movement behavior.\n\nLong distance 16-day movements decreased significantly by up to 36 %, from 142 km in 2007 to 92 km in 2021. Changes in gazelle mobility were affected by the increasing number of vehicles in Mongolia, but could not be explained by concurrent changes in other environmental factors like temperature, precipitation or vegetation greenness that often drive ungulate migration behavior. Moreover, we found that gazelle movement decreased close to roads, and that gazelles stayed further away from roads during the snow-free season, when vehicular traffic likely is most intense.\n\nConserving landscape permeability is essential for maintaining populations of highly mobile species. Our study provides evidence for a gradual decline in gazelle mobility over fifteen years as a response to increasing anthropogenic impact. To date, the transportation infrastructure permeating the Eastern Steppe does not pose physical barriers, yet our findings suggest that increasing traffic volume may create semipermeable barriers to gazelle movement. As human activity is increasing throughout the Eastern Steppe, interactions between ungulates and vehicle traffic need to be closely monitored in order to identify, localize, and mitigate semipermeable barrier effects before landscape permeability is severely altered.",

Evolutionary theory questions the stability of non-reciprocal interactions in which one plant has a positive net effect on a neighbor, which in return has a negative net impact on its benefactor. This type of interaction is known as antagonistic facilitation.\nC_LIO_LIWe develop a spatially explicit consumer-resource model for below-ground plant competition, including plants able to mine resources and make them available for any other plant in the community, termed ecosystem engineers. We use the model to assess whether and under which environmental conditions antagonistic facilitation via soil resource engineering is evolutionarily stable.\nC_LIO_LIWe find that antagonistic facilitation is stable in highly stressful conditions, which supports the theory of ecosystem engineers as drivers of primary succession and provides a theoretical ground to investigate facilitation mechanistically in the context of the stress gradient hypothesis.\nC_LIO_LIAmong all potential causes of stress considered in the model, the key environmental parameter driving changes in the interaction between plants is the proportion of the limiting resource available to plants without mining. This finding represents a challenge for empirical studies, which usually measure the resource input or loss in the system as a proxy for stress. We also find that the total root biomass and its spatial allocation through the root system, often used to measure the nature of the interaction between plants, do not predict facilitation reliably.\nC_LIO_LISynthesis. Antagonistic facilitation established between an ecosystem engineer nurse plant and neighbor opportunistic individuals can be evolutionarily stable in stressful environments where ecosystem engineers self-benefits from mining resources outweigh the competition with opportunistic neighbors. These results align with theories of primary succession and the stress gradient hypothesis as they show that antagonistic facilitation is stable under environmental stress, but it evolves into mutual interference in milder environments. However, using inaccurate parameters to measure facilitation and stress gradients in empirical studies might mask these patterns.\nC_LI",

To synthesize a protein, DNA must be transcribed as well as translated. Both processes need certain DNA sequence features. Stable transcription requires promoters and a polydenylation signal, while translation requires at least an open reading frame (ORF). We develop mathematical models based on mutation probabilities, and the assumption of neutral evolution, to find out how quickly genes emerge and are lost. We also investigate the effect of the order by which DNA features evolve, and if sequence composition is biased by mutation rate. We rationalize how genes are lost much more rapidly than they emerge, and how genes with long ORFs preferentially arise in regions that are already transcribed. Our study not only answers some fundamental questions on the topic of de novo emergence but also provides a modeling framework for future studies.",

This research represents a critical step in the development of genomic tools that enable the deployment of next-generation sequencing methods in the breeding of hazelnut, specifically the improvement of well-adapted Midwestern hazelnut varieties. To produce this map, we first developed high-density molecular markers using short-read Illumina sequencing of genotype-by-sequencing libraries. By aligning reads to a newly assembled reference genome for C. americana, we were able to identify over 75,000 high-quality indel-based polymorphisms across an F1 experimental population. These markers exhibited both high allele depth coverage, and low linkage disequilibrium, making them well-suited to genetic map development. We constructed such a map using 95 individuals from a single F1 family, demonstrating the utility of next-generation sequencing to efficiently and accurately generate high-density genetic maps. This research will improve the efficiency of breeding efforts, both through the validation of specific molecular markers that are associated with agronomically-relevant traits in breeding populations of interest.",

    "abstract": "Several asexual filamentous fungal pathogens contain supernumerary chromosomes carrying secondary metabolite (SM) or pathogenicity genes as well as transposons. Supernumerary chromosomes have been shown in in vitro experiments to transfer from pathogenic isolates to non-pathogenic ones and between isolates whose fusion can result in vegetative or heterokaryon incompatibility (HET). However, much is still unknown about the extent of horizontal transfer of supernumerary chromosomes within and between asexual pathogenic populations in adaptation to their hosts. We investigated several asexual fungal pathogens for genomic elements involved in maintaining telomeres for supernumerary and core chromosomes during vegetative reproduction. We found that in vegetative populations or lineages with a nearly complete telomere-to-telomere genome assembly (e.g. Fusarium equiseti and five formae speciales of the F. oxysporum species complex), core and supernumerary chromosomes were flanked by highly similar subtelomeric sequences on the 3 side and by their reverse complements on the 5 side. This subtelomere sequence structure was specific to the host. We detected instances of recent horizontal transfer of regions of a supernumerary chromosome between distant populations in the F. oxysporum species complex, and we also found field isolates with two structurally different copies of a supernumerary chromosome in a young asexual population, raising the possibility that those copies originated from different lineages by intrastrain anastomosis. A large number of HET domain genes were located in SM/pathogenicity gene clusters, with a potential role in marking these gene clusters during vegetative reproduction. The emergence of novel asexual pathogenic populations by horizontal transfer of transposon-rich supernumerary chromosomes within and between populations poses challenges to the control and management of these pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Bayesian decision theory (BDT) is frequently used to model normative performance in perceptual, motor, and cognitive decision tasks where the outcome of each trial is a reward or penalty that depends on the subjects actions. The resulting normative models specify how decision makers should encode and use information about uncertainty and value - step by step - in order to maximize their expected reward. When prior, likelihood, and posterior are probabilities, the Bayesian computation requires only simple arithmetic operations: addition, etc. We focus on visual cognitive tasks where Bayesian computations are carried out not on probabilities but on (1) probability density functions and (2) these probability density functions are derived from samples. We break the BDT model into a serries of computations and test human ability to carry out each of these computations in isolation. We test three necessary properties of normative use of pdf information derived from a sample - accuracy, additivity and influence. Influence measures allows us to assess how much weight each point in the sample is assigned in making decisions and allows us to compare normative use (weighting) of samples to actual, point by point. We find that human decision makers violate accuracy and additivity systematically but that the cost of failure in accuracy or additivity would be minor in common decision tasks. However, a comparison of measured influence for each sample point with normative influence measures demonstrates that the individuals use of sample information is markedly different from the predictions of BDT. We demonstrate that the normative BDT model takes into account the geometric symmetries of the pdf while the human decision maker does not. A heuristic model basing decisions on a single extreme sample point provided a better account for participants data than the normative BDT model.\n\nAuthor SummaryBayesian decision theory (BDT) is used to model human performance in tasks where the decision maker must compensate for uncertainty in order to to gain rewards and avoid losses. BDT prescribes how the decision maker can combine available data, prior knowledge, and value to reach a decision maximizing expected winnings. Do human decision makers actually use BDT in making decisions? Researchers typically compare overall human performance (total winnings) to the predictions of BDT but we cannot conclude that BDT is an adequate model for human performance based on just overall performance. We break BDT down into elementary operations and test human ability to execute such operations. In two of the tests human performance deviated only slightly (but systematically) from the predictions of BDT. In the third test we use a novel method to measure the influence of each sample point provided to the human decision maker and compare it to the influence predicted by BDT. When we look at what human decision makers do - in detail - we find that they use sensory information very differently from what the normative BDT observer does. We advance an alternative non-Bayesian model that better predicts human performance.",

    "abstract": "While moving, animals must frequently make decisions about their future travel direction, whether they are alone or in a group. Here we investigate this process for zebrafish (Danio rerio), which naturally move in cohesive groups. Employing state-of-the-art virtual reality, we study how real fish follow one or several moving, virtual conspecifics. These data are used to inform, and test, a model of social response that includes a process of explicit decision-making, whereby the fish can decide which of the virtual conspecifics to follow, or to follow some average direction. This approach is in contrast with previous models where the direction of motion was based on a continuous computation, such as directional averaging. Building upon a simplified version of this model [Sridhar et al., 2021], which has been shown to exhibit a spontaneous symmetry-breaking transition from moving along a \"compromise\" (average) direction, to deciding on following one of the virtual fish. This previously published simplified version was limited to a one-dimensional projection of the fish motion, while here we present a model that describes the motion of the real fish as it swims freely in two-dimensions. Here, we extend our proposed Ising-like model, which inherently describes a spontaneous symmetry-breaking transition from moving along a \"compromise\" (average) direction, to deciding on following one of the virtual fish. Motivated by experimental observations, the swim speed of the fish in this model uses a burst-and-coast swimming pattern, with the burst frequency being dependent on the distance of the fish from the followed conspecific(s). We demonstrate that this model is able to explain the observed spatial distribution of the real fish behind the virtual conspecifics in the experiments, as a function of their average speed and number. In particular, the model naturally explains the observed critical bifurcations for a freely swimming fish, which appear in the spatial distributions whenever the fish makes a decision to follow only one of the virtual conspecifics, instead of following them as an averaged group. This model can provide the foundation for modeling a cohesive shoal of swimming fish, while explicitly describing their directional decision-making process at the individual level.",

    "abstract": "Hippocampal place cell sequences have been hypothesized to serve as diverse purposes as the induction of synaptic plasticity, formation and consolidation of long-term memories, or navigation and planning. During spatial behaviors of rodents, sequential firing of place cells at the theta timescale (known as theta sequences) encodes running trajectories, which can be considered as 1-dimensional behavioral sequences of traversed locations. In a 2-dimensional space, however, each single location can be visited along arbitrary 1-dimensional running trajectories. Thus, a place cell will generally take part in multiple different theta sequences, raising questions about how this 2-dimensional topology can be reconciled with the idea of hippocampal sequences underlying memory of (1-dimensional) episodes. Here, we propose a computational model of cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) and dentate gyrus (DG), where sensorimotor input drives the direction-dependent (extrinsic) theta sequences within CA3 reflecting the 2-dimensional spatial topology, whereas the in-trahippocampal CA3-DG projections concurrently produce intrinsic sequences that are independent of the specific running trajectory. Consistent with experimental data, these intrinsic theta sequences are less prominent in the theta state, but we show that they can nevertheless be detected during theta activity, thereby serving as running-direction independent landmark cues. We hypothesize that the intrinsic sequences largely reflect replay and preplay activity during non-theta states.",

    "abstract": "Age-related hearing loss (presbycusis) at moderate levels (>40 dB HL) has been recognized as an important risk factor for cognitive decline. However, whether individuals with mild hearing loss (audiogram thresholds between 25 and 40 dB HL) or even those with normal audiograms (<25 dB HL) have a higher risk of dementia, is still debated. Importantly, these early stages of presbycusis are the most common among the elderly, indicating the need to screen and identify individuals with early presbycusis that have an increased risk of cognitive decline. Unfortunately, in this group of patients, audiogram thresholds are not sufficiently sensitive to detect all the hearing impairments that are related to cognitive decline. Consequently, at the individual level, audiogram thresholds are not good estimators of the dementia risk in the group with mild hearing loss or normal hearing thresholds. Here, we propose to use distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE), as an objective and sensitive tool to estimate the risk of clinically relevant cognitive decline in elders with normal hearing o mild hearing loss. We assessed neuropsychological, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and auditory analyses on 94 subjects aged >64 years old. In addition, cognitive and functional performance was evaluated with the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR SoB), assessed through structured interviews conducted by neurologists, who were blind to the DPOAE results. We found that cochlear dysfunction, measured by DPOAE -and not by conventional audiometry-, was associated with CDR SoB classification and brain atrophy in the group with mild hearing loss (25 to 40 dB), and normal hearing (<25 dB). Our findings suggest that DPOAE may be a non-invasive tool for detecting neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in the elderly, potentially allowing for early intervention.",

    "abstract": "Chronic exposure of the lung to irritants such as allergen is a primary cause of asthma characterized by exaggerated airway constriction, also called hyperreactivity, which can be life-threatening. Aside from immune cells, vagal sensory neurons are important for airway hyperreactivity 1-4. However, the identity and signature of the downstream nodes of this adaptive circuit remains poorly understood. Here we show that a single population of Dbh+ neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract (nTS) of the brainstem, and downstream neurons in the nucleus ambiguous (NA), are both necessary and sufficient for chronic allergen-induced airway hyperreactivity. We found that repeated exposures of mice to inhaled allergen activates nTS neurons in a mast cell-, interleukin 4 (IL-4)- and vagal nerve-dependent manner. Single-nucleus RNA-seq of the nTS at baseline and following allergen challenges reveals that a Dbh+ population is preferentially activated. Ablation or chemogenetic inactivation of Dbh+ nTS neurons blunted, while chemogenetic activation promoted hyperreactivity. Viral tracing indicates that Dbh+ nTS neurons, capable of producing norepinephrine, project to the NA, and NA neurons are necessary and sufficient to relay allergen signals to postganglionic neurons that then directly drive airway constriction. Focusing on transmitters, delivery of norepinephrine antagonists to the NA blunted allergen-induced hyperreactivity. Together, these findings provide molecular, anatomical and functional definitions of key nodes of a canonical allergen response circuit. The knowledge opens the possibility of targeted neural modulation as an approach to control refractory allergen-induced airway constriction.",

    "abstract": "Pattern formation originates during embryogenesis by a series of symmetry-breaking steps throughout an expanding cell lineage. In Drosophila, classic work has shown that the embryo segmentation is established by morphogens within a syncytium, and the subsequent action of the gap, pair-rule, and segment polarity genes. This classic model however does not translate directly to species that lack a syncytium - such as C. elegans - where cell fate is specified by cell-autonomous cell lineage programs and their inter-signaling. Previous single-cell RNA-Seq studies in C. elegans have analyzed cells from a mixed suspension of cells from many embryos to study late differentiation stages, or individual early stage embryos to study early gene expression in the embryo. To study the intermediate stages of early and late gastrulation (28- to 102- cells stages) missed by these approaches, here we determine the transcriptomes of the 1- to 102-cell stage to identify 119 embryonic cell-states during cell-fate specification, including  equivalence-group cell identities. We find that gene expression programs are modular according to the sub-cell lineages, each establishing a set of stripes by combinations of transcription factor gene expression across the anterior-posterior axis. In particular, expression of the homeodomain genes establishes a comprehensive lineage-specific positioning system throughout the embryo beginning at the 28-cell stage. Moreover, we find that genes that segment the entire embryo in Drosophila have orthologs in C. elegans that exhibit sub-lineage specific expression. These results suggest that the C. elegans embryo is patterned by a juxtaposition of distinct lineage-specific gene regulatory programs each with a unique encoding of cell location and fate. This use of homologous gene regulatory patterning codes suggests a deep homology of cell fate specification programs across diverse modes of development.",

The skeletal muscle possesses a uniquely large regenerative capacity within most vertebrates, and has thus become an important model for investigating cellular processes underpinning tissue regeneration. Following damage, the skeletal muscle mounts a complex regenerative cascade centered around dedicated muscle stem cells termed satellite cells. In non-injured muscle, satellite cells remain in a quiescent state, expressing the canonical marker Pax7 (Chen et al. 2020). However, following injury, satellite cells exit quiescence, enter the cell cycle to initiate proliferation, asymmetrically divide, and in many cases terminally differentiate into myoblasts, ultimately fusing with surrounding myoblasts and pre-existing muscle fibers to resolve the regenerative process (Chen et al. 2020).",

    "abstract": "Enhancers and promoters are considered to be bound by a small set of TFs in a sequence-specific manner. This assumption has come under increasing skepticism as the datasets of ChIP-seq assays have expanded. Particularly, high-occupancy target (HOT) loci attract hundreds of TFs with seemingly no detectable correlation between ChIP-seq peaks and DNA-binding motif presence. Here, we used 1,003 TF ChIP-seq datasets in HepG2, K562, and H1 cells to analyze the patterns of ChIP-seq peak co-occurrence combined with functional genomics datasets. We identified 43,891 HOT loci forming at the promoter (53%) and enhancer (47%) regions and determined that HOT promoters regulate housekeeping genes, whereas the HOT enhancers are involved in extremely tissue-specific processes. HOT loci form the foundation of human super-enhancers and evolve under strong negative selection, with some of them being ultraconserved regions. Sequence-based classification of HOT loci using deep learning suggests that their formation is driven by sequence features, and the density of ChIP-seq peaks correlates with sequence features. Based on their affinities to bind to promoters and enhancers, we detected five distinct clusters of TFs that form the core of the HOT loci. We also observed that HOT loci are enriched in 3D chromatin hubs and disease-causal variants. In a challenge to the classical model of enhancer activity, we report an abundance of HOT loci in human genome and a commitment of 51% of all ChIP-seq binding events to HOT locus formation and propose a model of HOT locus formation based on the existence of large transcriptional condensates.",

Failure to support increasing attentional load may result, in part, from abnormally overactive basal forebrain projections to the prefrontal cortex, and available antipsychotics often fail to address this issue. Orexin/hypocretin receptors are expressed on corticopetal cholinergic neurons, and their blockade has been shown to decrease the activity of cortical basal forebrain outputs and prefrontal cortical cholinergic neurotransmission. In the present experiment, rats (N = 14) trained in a visual sustained attention task that required discrimination of trials which presented a visual signal from trials during which no signal was presented. Once trained, rats were then co-administered the psychotomimetic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist dizocilpine (MK-801: 0 or 0.1 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injections) and the dual orexin receptor antagonist filorexant (MK-6096: 0, 0.1, or 1 mM, intracerebroventricular infusions) prior to task performance across six sessions. Dizocilpine impaired overall accuracy during signal trials, slowed reaction times for correctly-responded trials, and increased the number of omitted trials throughout the task. Dizocilpine-induced increases in signal trial deficits, correct response latencies, and errors of omission were reduced following infusions of the 0.1 mM, but not 1 mM, dose of filorexant. Orexin receptor blockade, perhaps through anticholinergic mechanisms, may improve attentional deficits in a state of NMDA receptor hypofunction.\n\nHighlightsO_LISchizophrenia is associated with attentional deficits that may stem from abnormally reactive BF projections to the prefrontal cortex\nC_LIO_LIOrexin receptor antagonists decrease acetylcholine release and reduce prefrontal cortical activity\nC_LIO_LIThe dual orexin receptor antagonist filorexant alleviated impairments of attention following NMDA receptor blockade\nC_LI",

Post hoc acoustic and statistical analyses of a 20-minute acoustic exchange between the broadcast of a recorded contact call, known as a  whup/throp, with call responses by Twain revealed an intentional human-whale acoustic (and behavioral) interaction. Our results show that Twain participated both physically and acoustically in three phases of interaction (Phase 1: Engagement, Phase 2: Agitation, Phase 3: Disengagement), independently determined by blind observers reporting on surface behavior and respiratory activity of the interacting whale. A close examination of both changes to the latency between Twains calls and the temporal matching to the latency of the exemplar across phases indicated that Twain was actively engaged in the exchange during Phase 1 (Engagement), less so during Phase 2 (Agitation), and disengaged during Phase 3 (Disengagement). These results, while preliminary, point to several key considerations for effective playback design, namely the importance of salient, dynamic and adaptive playbacks, that should be utilized in experimentation with whales and other intelligent nonhuman species.",

    "abstract": "Homologous recombination (HR) is a pathway for the accurate repair of double-stranded DNA breaks. These breaks are resected to yield single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that are coated by Replication Protein A (RPA). Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad52 is a mediator protein that promotes HR by facilitating formation of Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments on RPA-coated ssDNA. Canonically, Rad52 has been described to function by displacing RPA to promote Rad51 binding. However, in vitro, Rad51 readily forms a filament by displacing RPA in the absence of Rad52. Yet, in vivo, Rad52 is essential for HR. Here, we resolve how Rad52 functions as a mediator using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy and biophysical approaches. We show that Rad52 functions as a homodecamer and catalyzes single-position nucleation of Rad51. The N-terminal half of Rad52 is a well-ordered ring, while the C-terminal half is disordered. An intrinsic asymmetry within Rad52 is observed, where one or a few of the C-terminal halves interact with the ordered N-terminal ring. Within the C-terminal half, we identify two conserved charged patches that harbor the Rad51 and RPA interacting motifs. Interactions between these two charged patches regulate a ssDNA binding. These features drive Rad51 binding to a single position on the Rad52 decameric ring. We propose a Rad52 catalyzed single-position nucleation model for the formation of pre-synaptic Rad51 filaments in HR.",

    "abstract": "Impulse control disorders (ICDs), a wide spectrum of maladaptive behaviors which includes pathological gambling, hypersexuality and compulsive buying, have been recently suggested to be triggered or aggravated by treatments with dopamine D2/3 receptor agonists, such as pramipexole (PPX). Despite evidence showing that impulsivity is associated with functional alterations in corticostriatal networks, the neural basis of the exacerbation of impulsivity by PPX has not been elucidated. Here we used a hotspot analysis to assess the functional recruitment of several corticostriatal structures by PPX in male rats identified as highly (HI), moderately impulsive (MI) or with low levels of impulsivity (LI) in the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT). PPX dramatically reduced impulsivity in HI rats. Assessment of the expression pattern of the two immediate early genes C-fos and Zif268 by in situ hybridization subsequently revealed that PPX resulted in a decrease in Zif268 mRNA levels in different striatal regions of both LI and HI rats accompanied by a high impulsivity specific reduction of Zif268 mRNA levels in prelimbic and cingulate cortices. PPX also decreased C-fos mRNA levels in all striatal regions of LI rats, but only in the dorsolateral striatum and nucleus accumbens core (NAc Core) of HI rats. Structural equation modelling further suggested that the anti-impulsive effect of PPX was mainly attributable to the specific downregulation of Zif268 mRNA in the NAc Core. Altogether, our results show that PPX restores impulse control in highly impulsive rats by modulation of limbic frontostriatal circuits.",

    "abstract": "Malaria and iron deficiency are major global health problems with extensive epidemiological overlap. Iron deficiency-induced anaemia can protect the host from malaria by limiting parasite growth. On the other hand, iron deficiency can significantly disrupt immune cell function. However, the impact of host cell iron scarcity beyond anaemia remains elusive in malaria. To address this, we employed a transgenic mouse model carrying a mutation in the transferrin receptor (TfrcY20H/Y20H), which limits the ability of cells to internalise iron from plasma. At homeostasis TfrcY20H/Y20H mice appear healthy and are not anaemic. However, TfrcY20H/Y20H mice infected with Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi AS showed significantly higher peak parasitaemia and body weight loss. We found that TfrcY20H/Y20H mice displayed a similar trajectory of malaria-induced anaemia as wild-type mice, and elevated circulating iron did not increase peak parasitaemia. Instead, P. chabaudi infected TfrcY20H/Y20H mice had an impaired innate and adaptive immune response, marked by decreased cell proliferation and cytokine production.\n\nMoreover, we demonstrated that these immune cell impairments were cell-intrinsic, as ex vivo iron supplementation fully recovered CD4 T cell and B cell function. Despite the inhibited immune response and increased parasitaemia, TfrcY20H/Y20H mice displayed mitigated liver damage, characterised by decreased parasite sequestration in the liver and an attenuated hepatic immune response. Together, these results show that host cell iron scarcity inhibits the immune response but prevents excessive hepatic tissue damage during malaria infection. These divergent effects shed light on the role of iron in the complex balance between protection and pathology in malaria.",

    "abstract": "Poxviruses are large double-stranded DNA viruses that infect a wide range of animals including humans. Since the eradication of smallpox, other members of the poxvirus family, such as monkeypox virus (MPXV) are still posing a great threat to public health. Vaccinia virus (VACV) is a prototypic poxvirus used as the vaccine strain for smallpox eradication. VACV encodes a serine protease inhibitor 1 (SPI-1) conserved in all orthopoxviruses, which has been recognized as a host range factor for modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), an approved smallpox vaccine and a promising vaccine vector. FAM111A, a nuclear protein that regulates host DNA replication, was shown to restrict the replication of VACV-{Delta}SPI-1 in human cells. Nevertheless, the detailed antiviral mechanisms of FAM111A were unresolved. Here, we show that FAM111A is a potent restriction factor for VACV-{Delta}SPI-1 and MVA. Deletion of FAM111A rescued the replication of MVA and VACV-{Delta}SPI-1 and overexpression of FAM111A significantly reduced viral DNA replication and virus titers but did not affect viral early gene expression. The antiviral effect of FAM111A necessitated its trypsin-like protease domain and DNA binding domain but not the PCNA-interacting motif. We further discovered that FAM111A translocated into the cytoplasm upon VACV infection and this process was mediated by the cGAS-STING signaling pathway. Infection-triggered FAM111A degraded the nuclear pore complex via its protease activity, translocated to the cytoplasm, and interacted with and promoted the degradation of virus DNA binding protein I3 in a DNA-dependent manner. Interestingly, the protease activity of FAM111A was only needed for nuclear export but not I3 degradation as further analysis showed I3 was degraded through autophagy. Moreover, VACV SPI-1 was found primarily in the nucleus of infected cells and antagonized FAM111A by prohibiting its nuclear export. MPXV and lumpy skin disease virus SPI-1s also inhibited human FAM111A. Our findings reveal the detailed mechanism by which FAM111A functions to restrict a cytoplasmic DNA virus and provide explanations for the immune evasive function of VACV SPI-1.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT/SUMMARYProtein-protein interactions (PPIs) form the underpinnings of any cellular signaling network. PPIs are highly dynamic processes and often, cell-based assays can be essential for their study as they closely mimic the biological intricacies of cellular environments. Since no sole platform can perform all needed experiments to gain a thoroughly comprehensive understanding into these processes, developing a versatile toolkit is much needed to address this longstanding gap. The use of small peptide tags, such as the V5-tag, has been extensively used in biological and biomedical research, including labeling the C-termini of one of the largest human genome-wide open-reading frame collections. However, these small peptide tags have been primarily used in vitro and lack the in vivo traceability and functionality of larger specialized tags. In this study, we combined structural studies and computer-aided maturation to generate an intracellular nanobody, interacting with the V5-tag. Suitable for assays commonly used to study protein-protein interactions, our nanobody has been applied herein to interrogate G protein-coupled receptor signalling. This novel serviceable intrabody is the cornerstone of a multipurpose intracellular nanobody-based biosensors toolkit, named iBodyV5, which will be available for the scientific community at large.",

    "abstract": "Gamete formation is essential for sexual reproduction in metazoans. In males, spermatogenesis gives rise to interconnected spermatids that have to differentiate and individualize into mature sperm. In Drosophila melanogaster, individualization of spermatids requires the formation of individualization complexes that synchronously move along the sperm bundles. Here, we show that Mob4, a member of the Mps-one binder family, is essential for male fertility but has no detectable role on female fertility. We describe the function of Mob4 during spermatid individualization, showing that Mob4 is required for proper axonemal structure and that the loss of Mob4 leads to male sterility associated with defective spermatid individualization and absence of mature sperm in the seminal vesicles. Transmission electron micrographs of Mob4RNAi developing spermatids revealed defects in axoneme structure and abnormal mitochondria biogenesis. Importantly, we find that male fertility is impaired upon depletion of other STRIPAK components, suggesting that Mob4 acts through STRIPAK to support spermiogenesis. As we show that expression of the human Mob4 gene effectively rescues all phenotypes of Mob4 downregulation, the gene is not only evolutionary but also functionally conserved. We propose that Mob4 plays a role in regulating the microtubule- and actin-cytoskeleton during spermatogenesis. This study advances our understanding of male infertility by uncovering Mob4 as a novel gene required for sperm individualization.",

    "abstract": "To survive in extreme environments such as hot-arid deserts, desert-dwelling species have evolved physiological traits to withstand the high temperatures and low aridity beyond the physiologically tolerable ranges of most species. Such traits which include reducing water loss have independently evolved in multiple taxa. However, the genetic and evolutionary mechanisms underlying these traits have thus far not been elucidated. Here we show that Drosophila mojavensis, a fruitfly species endemic to the Sonoran and Mojave deserts, had evolved extremely high desiccation resistance, by producing very long chained methylbranched cuticular hydrocarbons (mbCHCs) that contributes to a cuticular waterproofing lipid layer reducing water loss. We show that the ability to synthesize these longer mbCHCs is due to evolutionary changes in a fatty acyl-CoA elongase (mElo). CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of mElo in D. mojavensis led to loss of longer mbCHC production and significant reduction of desiccation resistance at high temperatures but did not affect mortality at high temperatures or desiccating conditions individually, indicating that this gene is crucial for desert adaptation. Phylogenetic analysis showed that mElo is a Drosophila specific gene with no clear ortholog outside Diptera. This suggests that while the physiological mechanisms underlying desert adaptation are general, the genetic mechanisms may be lineage-specific.",

Here, we established an immunoassay for detecting circulating autoantibodies against L1 proteins in human blood. Using this assay in >3,000 individuals with or without cancer, we observed significantly higher IgG titers against L1-encoded ORF1p and ORF2p in patients with lung, pancreatic, ovarian, esophageal, and liver cancers compared to healthy individuals. Remarkably, elevated levels of anti-ORF1p-reactive IgG were observed in cancer patients with disease stages 1 and 2, indicating that immune response to L1 antigens can occur at early phases of carcinogenesis.

    "abstract": "Trabecular meshwork (TM) cells are highly contractile and mechanosensitive to aid in maintaining intraocular pressure (IOP) homeostasis. Lipids are attributed to modulating TM contractility with poor mechanistic understanding. In this study using human TM cells, we identify the mechanosensing role of the transcription factors sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) involved in lipogenesis. By constitutively activating SREBPs and pharmacologically inactivating SREBPs, we have mechanistically deciphered the attributes of SREBPs in regulating the contractile properties of TM. The pharmacological inhibition of SREBPs by fatostatin and molecular inactivation of SREBPs ex vivo and in vivo respectively results in significant IOP lowering. As a proof of concept, fatostatin significantly decreased the SREBPs responsive genes and enzymes involved in lipogenic pathways as well as the levels of the phospholipid, cholesterol, and triglyceride. Further, we show that fatostatin mitigated actin polymerization machinery and stabilization, and decreased ECM synthesis and secretion. We thus postulate that lowering lipogenesis in the TM outflow pathway can hold the key to lowering IOP by modifying the TM biomechanics.\n\nSynopsisIn this study, we show the role of lipogenic transcription factors sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) in the regulation of intraocular pressure (IOP).

    "abstract": "Stem cell quiescence, proliferation and differentiation are controlled by interactions with niche cells and a specialized extracellular matrix called the basement membrane (BM). Direct interactions with adjacent BM are known to regulate stem cell quiescence; however, it is less clear how niche BM relays signals to stem cells that it does not contact. Here, we examine how niche BM regulates C. elegans primordial germ cells (PGCs), which remain quiescent during embryogenesis. Depleting the BM protein laminin causes embryonic PGCs to proliferate, indicating that laminin functions to maintain PGC quiescence. How laminin signals to the PGCs remains unclear, as somatic niche cells enwrap PGCs and physically exclude them from contacting the BM. Here, we show that, following laminin depletion, gonadal niche cells relay proliferation-inducing signals from the gonadal BM to PGCs via integrin receptors. Mutations disrupting the BM proteoglycan perlecan block PGC proliferation when laminin is depleted, suggesting that laminin functions to inhibit a proliferation-inducing signal originating from perlecan. Our results reveal how BM signals can regulate stem cell quiescence indirectly, by activating niche cell integrin receptors.",

    "abstract": "Dingoes arrived in Australia during the mid-Holocene and are the native top-order terrestrial predator on the mainland and some offshore islands. Although dingoes subsequently spread across the continent, the initial founding population(s) could have been small. To investigate this hypothesis, we examined the potential signatures of bottlenecks and founder effects in dingoes by sequencing the whole genomes of three dingoes and also obtaining the genome data from nine additional dingoes and 56 canines, including wolves, village dogs and breed dogs, and examined the signatures of bottlenecks and founder effects. We found that the nucleotide diversity of dingoes was low, and 36% less than highly inbred breed dogs and 3.3 times lower than wolves. The number of runs of homozygosity (RoH) segments in dingoes was 1.6 to 4.7 times higher than in other canines. Whilst examining deleterious mutational load, we observed that dingoes carried elevated ratios of nonsynonymous-to-synonymous diversities, significantly higher numbers of homozygous deleterious Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs), and increased numbers of loss of function SNVs, compared to breed dogs, village dogs, and wolves. These results suggest dingoes experienced a severe bottleneck, potentially caused by the limited number of founding individuals. While many studies observe less diversity and a higher number of deleterious mutations in domesticated populations compared to their wild relatives, we observed the opposite - .i.e. wild dingoes have lower diversity and a greater number of harmful mutations than domesticated dogs. Our findings can be explained by bottlenecks and founder effects during the establishment of dingoes on mainland Australia. These findings highlight the need for conservation-based management of dingoes and need for wildlife managers to be cognisant of these findings when considering the use of lethal control measures across the landscape.",

The genome of K. lacca was 256.62 Mb and the Scaffold N50 was 28.53 Mb. A total of 56.94 Mb of repeat sequences, constituting 22.19% of the assembled genome, were identified.

Meanwhile, we constructed the lac synthesis biosynthetic pathway and screened 25 putative key genes in the synthesis pathway by transcriptome analysis in different developmental stages and tissues.

    "abstract": "A key goal of synthetic biology is to establish functional biochemical modules with network-independent properties. Antithetic integral feedback (AIF) is a recently developed control module in which two control species perfectly annihilate each others biological activity. The AIF module confers robust perfect adaptation to the steady-state average level of a controlled intracellular component when subjected to sustained perturbations. Recent work has suggested that such robustness comes at the unavoidable price of increased stochastic fluctuations around average levels. We present theoretical results that support and quantify this trade-off for the commonly analyzed AIF variant in the idealized limit with perfect annihilation. However, we also show that this trade-off is a singular limit of the control module: Even minute deviations from perfect adaptation allow systems to achieve effective noise suppression as long as cells can pay the corresponding energetic cost. We further show that a variant of the AIF control module can achieve significant noise suppression even in the idealized limit with perfect adaptation. This atypical configuration may thus be preferable in synthetic biology applications.",

We conducted a monthly survey of the surface and deep layers of a large and deep freshwater lake (Lake Biwa, Japan) for a year and analyzed the prokaryotic production and prokaryotic/viral metagenome. Our analysis (including 1 608 prokaryotes and 13 761 viruses) revealed that 19 prokaryotic species, accounting for [~]40% of total abundance, might be suppressed by viruses when prokaryotic production is higher. This suggests that a small proportion of prokaryotes contribute to a large amount of prokaryotic abundance, and these prokaryotes are infected and lysed by viruses, driving the viral shunt in the freshwater lake. Furthermore, we found that annual vertical mixing might yield a similar rate of community change between the surface and deep layers. This finding might be valuable in understanding how the communities change when the stratification of freshwater lakes is affected by global warming in the future.",
