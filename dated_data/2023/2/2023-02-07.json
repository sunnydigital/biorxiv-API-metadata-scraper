    "abstract": "The recent epidemics of dengue in South West Indian Ocean coincided with the emergence of Cosmopolitan dengue virus type 2, including viral strains DES-14 in Tanzania and then RUN-18 in La Reunion. The initial step of dengue virus assembly is the formation of heterodimers between prM and E proteins where prM acts as a chaperone for E. During dengue virus maturation, prM is cleaved into membrane protein M which embeds a pro-apoptotic peptide consisting of residues 31/41 and referred as ApoptoM. An infrequent valine at position M-36 was found in DES-14 whereas RUN-18 bears a common isoleucine. Here, we investigated whether Ile-to-Val substitution at position M-36 may have an impact on RUN-18 E expression and cell-death promoting capability of RUN-18 ApoptoM. Using recombinant RUN-18 envelope proteins expressed in human epithelial A549 cells, we showed that Ile-to-Val but not Ile-to-Ala substitution affects the behavior E protein reducing the cytotoxicity of prM and E proteins. The substitution of isoleucine by valine at position M-36 leads to increase the apoptosis-inducing activity of ApoptoM. Our data highlight that hydrophobic nature of amino-acid residue in position 36 of dengue virus M protein influences E protein expression and death-promoting activity of ApoptoM opens up important perspectives in the development of effective live-attenuated DENV vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is not curative due to the existence of cellular reservoirs of latent HIV-1 that persist during therapy. Current research efforts to cure HIV-1 infection include \"shock and kill\" strategies to disrupt latency using small molecules or latency-reversing agents (LRAs) to induce expression of HIV-1 enabling cytotoxic immune cells to eliminate infected cells. The modest success of current LRAs urges the field to identify novel drugs with increased clinical efficacy. Aminobisphosphonates (N-BPs) that include pamidronate, zoledronate, or alendronate, are the first-line treatment of bone-related diseases including osteoporosis and bone malignancies. Here, we show the use of N-BPs as a novel class of LRA: we found in ex vivo assays using primary cells from ART-suppressed people living with HIV-1 that N-BPs induce HIV-1 from latency to levels that are comparable to the T cell activator phytohemagglutinin (PHA). RNA sequencing and mechanistic data suggested that reactivation may occur through activation of the activator protein 1 signaling pathway. Stored samples from a prior clinical trial aimed at analyzing the effect of alendronate on bone mineral density, provided further evidence of alendronate-mediated latency reversal and activation of immune effector cells. Decay of the reservoir measured by IPDA was however not detected. Our results demonstrate the novel use of N-BPs to reverse HIV-1 latency while inducing immune effector functions. This preliminary evidence merits further investigation in a controlled clinical setting possibly in combination with therapeutic vaccination.",

    "abstract": "The 2021/2022 epizootic of high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAIV) remains one of the largest ever in the UK, being caused by a clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 HPAIV. This epizootic affected more than 145 poultry premises, most likely through independent incursion from infected wild birds, supported by more than 1700 individual detections of H5N1 from wild bird mortalities. Here an H5N1 HPAIV, representative of this epizootic (H5N1-21), was used to investigate its virulence, pathogenesis and transmission in layer chickens and pekin ducks, two species of epidemiological importance. We inoculated both avian species with decreasing H5N1-21 doses. The virus was highly infectious in ducks, with high infection levels and accompanying shedding of viral RNA, even in ducks inoculated with the lowest dose, reflecting the strong waterfowl adaptation of the clade 2.3.4.4 HPAIVs. Duck-to-duck transmission was very efficient, coupled with high environmental contamination. H5N1-21 was frequently detected in water sources, serving as likely sources of infection for ducks, but inhalable dust and aerosols represented low transmission risks. In contrast, chickens inoculated with the highest dose exhibited lower rates of infection compared to ducks. There was no evidence for experimental H5N1-21 transmission to any naive chickens, in two stocking density scenarios, coupled with minimal and infrequent contamination being detected in the chicken environment. Systemic viral dissemination to multiple organs reflected the pathogenesis and high mortalities in both species. In summary, the H5N1-21 virus is highly infectious and transmissible in anseriformes, yet comparatively poorly adapted to galliformes, supporting strong host preferences for wild waterfowl. Key environmental matrices were also identified as being important in the epidemiological spread of this virus during the continuing epizootic.",

    "abstract": "Populations of microbial cells may resist environmental stress by maintaining a high population-median resistance (IC50) or, potentially, a high variability in resistance between individual cells (heteroresistance); where heteroresistance would allow certain cells to resist high stress, provided the population was sufficiently large to include resistant cells. This study sets out to test the hypothesis that both IC50 and heteroresistance may contribute to conventional minimal-inhibitory-concentration (MIC) determinations, using the example of spoilage-yeast resistance to the preservative sorbic acid. Across a panel of 26 diverse yeast species, both heteroresistance and particularly IC50 were positively correlated with predicted MIC. A focused panel of 29 different isolates of a particular spoilage yeast was also examined (isolates previously recorded as Zygosaccharomyces bailii, but genome resequencing revealing that several were in fact hybrid species, Z. parabailii and Z. pseudobailii). Applying a novel high-throughput assay for heteroresistance, it was found that IC50 but not heteroresistance was positively correlated with predicted MIC when considered across all isolates of this panel, but the heteroresistance-MIC interaction differed for the individual Zygosaccharomyces subspecies. Z. pseudobailii exhibited higher heteroresistance than Z. parabailii whereas the reverse was true for IC50, suggesting possible alternative strategies for achieving high MIC between subspecies. This work highlights the limitations of conventional MIC measurements due to the effect of heteroresistance in certain organisms, as the measured resistance can vary markedly with population (inoculum) size.\n\nImportanceFood spoilage by fungi is a leading cause of food waste, with specialised food spoilage yeasts capable of growth at preservative concentrations above the legal limit, in part due to heteroresistance allowing small subpopulations of cells to exhibit extreme preservative resistance. Whereas heteroresistance has been characterised in numerous ecological contexts, measuring this phenotype systematically and assessing its importance are not encompassed by conventional assay methods. The development here of a high-throughput method for measuring heteroresistance, amenable to automation, addresses this issue and has enabled characterisation of the contribution that heteroresistance may make to conventional MIC measurements. We used the example of sorbic acid heteroresistance in spoilage yeasts like Zygosaccharomyces spp, but the approach is relevant to other fungi and other inhibitors, including antifungals. The work shows how median resistance, heteroresistance and inoculum size should all be considered when selecting appropriate inhibitor doses in real-world antimicrobial applications such as food preservation.",

    "abstract": "Leaf stacking fermentation involves enzymatic actions of many microorganisms and is an efficient and environmentally benign process for degrading macromolecular organic compounds. We investigated the dynamics of metabolite profiles, bacterial and fungal communities and their interactions during fermentation using cigar leaves from three geographic regions. The results showed that the contents of total sugar, reducing sugar, starch, cellulose, lignin, pectin, polyphenol and protein in cigar tobacco leaves was significantly decreased during fermentation. Notably, the furfural, neophytadiene, pyridine, benzyl alcohol, geranyl acetone, 2-butanone, 3-hydroxy-, N-hexanal, isoamylalcohol and 2,3-pentanedione were important features volatile aroma compounds during fermentation. The -diversity of fungi and bacteria initially increased and then decreased during fermentation. The microbial diversity was influenced by fermentation stages and growing locations, in which the fermentation stages had greater impacts on the microbial diversity than locations. Microbiome profiling had identified several core bacteria including Sphingomonas, Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Ralstonia, Massilia and Fibrobacter. Fungal biomarkers included Aspergillus, Penicillium, Fusarium, Cladosporium and Trichomonascus. Interestingly, the molecular ecological networks showed that the core taxa had significant correlations with metabolic enzymes and physicochemical properties; bacteria and fungi jointly participated in the carbohydrate and nitrogen compound degrading and volatile aroma compound chemosynthesis processes during fermentation. These studies provide insights into the coupling of material conversion and microbial community succession during leaf fermentation.\n\nIMPORTANCECigar tobacco leaves are still crude after air curing. Fermentation can eliminate the pungent and bitter taste of the leaves and promote the accumulations of aromatic compounds. Hitherto, there has been no systematic study on the material conversion, metabolic enzymes and microbial community changes and their interactions in fermented leaves. The significance of our research is in identifying the potential metabolic cooperation related to microbial community, which will greatly enhance our understanding of microorganism to convert macromolecular organic to small molecules during the leaf stacking fermentation process.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBroad-scale monitoring of arthropods is often carried out with passive traps (e.g. Malaise traps) that can collect thousands of specimens per sample. The identification of individual specimens requires time and taxonomic expertise, limiting the geographical and temporal scale of research and monitoring studies. DNA metabarcoding of bulk-sample homogenates is faster and has been found to be efficient and reliable, but is destructive and prevents a posteriori validation of species occurrences and/or relative abundances. Non-destructive DNA metabarcoding from the collection medium has been applied in a limited number of studies, but further tests of efficiency are required in a broader range of circumstances to assess the consistency of the method.\n\nMethodsWe quantified the detection rate of arthropod species when applying non-destructive DNA metabarcoding with a short (127-bp) fragment of mitochondrial COI on two types of passive traps and collection media: 1) water with monopropylene glycol (H2O-MPG) used in window-flight traps (WFT, 53 in total); 2) ethanol with monopropylene glycol (EtOH-MPG) used in Malaise traps (MT, 27 in total). We then compared our results with those obtained for the same samples using morphological identification (for WFTs) or destructive metabarcoding of bulk homogenate (for MTs). This comparison was applied as part of a larger study of arthropod species richness in silver fir (Abies alba) stands across a range of climate-induced tree dieback levels and forest management strategies.\n\nResultsOf the 53 H2O-MPG samples from WFTs, 16 produced no metabarcoding results, while the remaining 37 samples yielded 77 arthropod MOTUs in total. None of those MOTUs were shared species with the 389 morphological taxa (343 of which were Coleoptera) obtained from the same traps. Metabarcoding of 26 EtOH-MPG samples from MTs detected more arthropod MOTUs (233) and insect orders (11) than destructive metabarcoding of homogenate (146 MOTUs, 8 orders). Arachnida and Collembola were more diverse in EtOH-MPG samples, but Hymenoptera, Coleoptera and Lepidoptera were less represented than in homogenate. Overall, MOTU richness per trap similar for EtOH-MPG (21.81 MOTUs) than for homogenate (32.4 MOTUs). Arthropod communities from EtOH-MPG and homogenate metabarcoding were relatively distinct, with 162 MOTUs (53%) unique to the collection medium and only 71 MOTUs (23%) present in both treatments. Finally, collection medium did not reveal any significant changes in arthropod richness along a disturbance gradient in silver fir forests. We conclude that DNA metabarcoding of collection medium can be used to complement homogenate metabarcoding in inventories to favour the detection of soft-bodied arthropods like spiders.",

    "abstract": "Mediation analysis is a useful tool in biomedical research to investigate how molecular phenotypes, such as gene expression, mediate the effect of an exposure on health outcomes. However, commonly used mean-based total mediation effect measures may suffer from cancellation of component-wise mediation effects of opposite directions in the presence of high-dimensional omics mediators. To overcome this limitation, a variance-based R-squared total mediation effect measure has been recently proposed, which, nevertheless, relies on the computationally intensive nonparametric bootstrap for confidence interval estimation. In this work, we formulate a more efficient two-stage cross-fitted estimation procedure for the R-squared measure. To avoid potential bias, we perform iterative Sure Independence Screening (iSIS) in two subsamples to exclude the non-mediators, followed by ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions for the variance estimation. We then construct confidence intervals based on the newly-derived closed-form asymptotic distribution of the R-squared measure. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed procedure is hundreds of times more computationally efficient than the resampling-based method with comparable coverage probability. Furthermore, when applied to the Framingham Heart Study, the proposed method replicated the established finding of gene expression mediating age-related variation in systolic blood pressure and discovered the role of gene expression profiles in the relationship between sex and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The proposed cross-fitted interval estimation procedure is implemented in R package RsqMed.",

    "abstract": "Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), an important post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism in gene expression, is actively involved in a series of cellular and physiological processes, thus controlling cell fate and tissue homeostasis. Defects in NMD cause human diseases such as neurodevelopmental disorders, tumorigenesis and autoimmunity. UPF3 (Up- frameshift protein 3), first identified in the bakers yeast, is a core NMD factor. UPF3A and UPF3B, the two UPF3 paralogs emerging in vertebrates, have either activating or suppressing roles in NMD. Previous studies found that UPF3B protein is ubiquitously expressed in almost all mammalian organs, while UPF3A protein is hardly detectable in most of mammalian tissues, except in the testis. One hypothesis explaining this phenomena is the functional antognism between UPF3A and UPF3B in NMD. Thus, UPF3B competitively binds to UPF2 with higher affinity than UPF3A, which finally destabilizes UPF3A protein. In the present study, we quantitatively evaluated the expression of UPF3A and UPF3B in nine major tissues and reproductive organs of wild type male and female mice. Our study confirmed that UPF3A has the highest expression in male germlines. To our surprise, we found in most tissues, including brain and thymus, the protein level of UPF3A is comparable with that of UPF3B. In spleen and lung, UPF3A is higher than UPF3B. These findings are further supported by publicly available gene expression data. Thus, our study demonstrated that UPF3A protein is ubiquitously expressed in mouse tissues, and may play important roles in the homeostasis of multiple mammalian tissues.",

Binding of transferrin to its receptor (TFRC, transferrin receptor protein 1) initiates endocytic trafficking and subsequent recycling of TFRC to the plasma membrane. RAB8-positive tubules emanating from the endocytic recycling compartment play an important role in receptor recycling. However, the signaling pathways or mechanisms that mediate formation of RAB8-positive tubules are not clear. Here, we have investigated the role of transferrin-induced signaling in the regulation of RAB8- and MICAL-L1-positive tubules. Addition of transferrin to the serum starved HeLa cells resulted in enhanced recruitment of RAB8 as well as MICAL-L1 to the tubules, which was mediated by TFRC. Dynasore, an inhibitor of dynamin and endocytosis, completely blocked transferrin-induced formation of RAB8/MICAL-L1-positive tubules. RAB8 showed strong colocalization with MICAL-L1 on the tubules. Blocking of SRC or AKT kinase activity by specific inhibitors abolished transferrin-induced recruitment of RAB8 and MICAL-L1 to the tubules. Recycling of transferrin receptor was inhibited by blocking of AKT activity. TBC1D17, a GTPase activating protein for RAB8, inhibited RAB8/MICAL-L1-positive tubule formation. A phospho-mimicking mutant S366D of TBC1D17 did not inhibit formation of RAB8-positive tubules. Overall, these results show that transferrin induces TFRC mediated signaling dependent on endocytosis that is essential for the formation of RAB8- and MICAL-L1-positive tubules involved in recycling of transferrin receptor. Our results also show that AKT regulates transferrin-induced formation of RAB8- and MICAL-L1-positive tubules, which might be mediated by phosphorylation of TBC1D17.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo facilitate in vitro mechanistic studies in pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and subsequent tubal factor infertility, as well as ovarian carcinogenesis, we sought to establish patient tissue derived fallopian tube (FT) organoids and to study their inflammatory response to acute vaginal bacterial infection.\n\nDesignExperimental study.\n\nSettingAcademic medical and research center.\n\nPatientsFT tissues were obtained from four patients after salpingectomy for benign gynecological diseases.\n\nInterventionsWe introduced acute infection in the FT organoid culture system by inoculating the organoid culture media with two common vaginal bacterial species, Lactobacillus crispatus and Fannyhessea vaginae.\n\nMain Outcome MeasuresThe inflammatory response elicited in the organoids after acute bacterial infection was analyzed by the expression profile of 249 inflammatory genes.\n\nResultsCompared to the negative controls that were not cultured with any bacteria, the organoids cultured with either bacterial species showed multiple differentially expressed inflammatory genes. Marked differences were noted between the Lactobacillus crispatus infected organoids and those infected by Fannyhessea vaginae. Genes from the C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL) family were highly upregulated in F. vaginae infected organoids. Flow cytometry showed that immune cells quickly disappeared during the organoid culture, indicating the inflammatory response observed with bacterial culture was generated by the epithelial cells in the organoids.\n\nConclusionPatient tissue derived FT organoids respond to acute bacterial infection with upregulation of inflammatory genes specific to different vaginal bacterial species. FT organoids is a useful model system to study the host-pathogen interaction during bacterial infection which may facilitate mechanistic investigations in PID and its contribution to tubal factor infertility and ovarian carcinogensis.",

    "abstract": "Mermithid nematodes are obligate invertebrate parasites dating back to the Early Cretaceous. Their fossil record is sparse, especially before the Cenozoic, thus little is known about their early host associations. This study reports 16 new mermithids associated with their insect hosts from mid-Cretaceous Kachin amber, 12 of which include previously unknown hosts. These fossils indicate that mermithid parasitism of invertebrates was already widespread and played an important role in the mid-Cretaceous terrestrial ecosystem. Remarkably, three hosts (bristletails, barklice and perforissid planthoppers) were previously unknown to be parasitized by mermithids both past and present. Furthermore, our statistical analyses show that in contrast to their Cenozoic counterparts, Cretaceous nematodes including mermithids are more abundant in heterometabolous insect hosts. This result suggests that nematodes have not completely exploited the dominant Holometabola as their hosts until the Cenozoic. This study reveals what appears to be a vanished history of nematodes that parasitized Cretaceous insects.",

    "abstract": "1A growing body of evidence suggests that gene flow between closely related species is a widespread phenomenon. Alleles that introgress from one species into a close relative are typically neutral or deleterious, but sometimes confer a significant fitness advantage. Given the potential relevance to speciation and adaptation, numerous methods have therefore been devised to identify regions of the genome that have experienced introgression. Recently, supervised machine learning approaches have been shown to be highly effective for detecting introgression. One especially promising approach is to treat population genetic inference as an image classification problem, and feed an image representation of a population genetic alignment as input to a deep neural network that distinguishes among evolutionary models (i.e. introgression or no introgression). However, if we wish to investigate the full extent and fitness effects of introgression, merely identifying genomic regions in a population genetic alignment that harbor introgressed loci is insufficient--ideally we would be able to infer precisely which individuals have introgressed material and at which positions in the genome. Here we adapt a deep learning algorithm for semantic segmentation, the task of correctly identifying the type of object to which each individual pixel in an image belongs, to the task of identifying introgressed alleles. Our trained neural network is thus able to infer, for each individual in a two-population alignment, which of those individuals alleles were introgressed from the other population. We use simulated data to show that this approach is highly accurate, and that it can be readily extended to identify alleles that are introgressed from an unsampled \"ghost\" population, performing comparably to a supervised learning method tailored specifically to that task. Finally, we apply this method to data from Drosophila, showing that it is able to accurately recover introgressed haplotypes from real data. This analysis reveals that introgressed alleles are typically confined to lower frequencies within genic regions, suggestive of purifying selection, but are found at much higher frequencies in a region previously shown to be affected by adaptive introgression. Our methods success in recovering introgressed haplotypes in challenging real-world scenarios underscores the utility of deep learning approaches for making richer evolutionary inferences from genomic data.",

    "abstract": "Microbial eukaryotes can be infected by giant viruses, which can be infected by virophages. Virophages are parasites of the virus transcription machinery and can interfere with virus replication, resulting in a benefit to the eukaryotic host population. Surprisingly, virophages can integrate into the genomes of their cell or virus hosts, and have been shown to reactivate during coinfection. This raises interesting questions about the role of integration in the dynamics of cell-virus-virophage systems. Here, we use mathematical models and computational simulations to understand the effect of virophage integration on populations of cells and viruses. We also investigate programmed-cell death (PCD) and multicellularity as potential antiviral defence strategies used by cells. We found that virophages which enter the cell independently of the host virus, such as Mavirus, are expected to integrate commonly into the genomes of their cell hosts. In contrast, we show that virophages like Sputnik which form a complex with the giant virus, should rarely be found integrated in cell genomes. Alternatively, we found that Sputnik virophages can stably persist integrated in the virus population, as long as they do not completely inhibit virus replication. We also show that increasing virophage inhibition can stabilise oscillatory dynamics, which may explain the long-term persistence of viruses and virophages in the environment. Our results demonstrate that inhibition by virophages, PCD and multicellularity are effective antiviral strategies that may act in synergy against viral infection in microbial species.",

    "abstract": "The mutation rate plays an important role in adaptive evolution. It can be modified by mutator and anti-mutator alleles. Recent empirical evidence hints that the mutation rate may vary among genetically identical individuals: empirical evidence from bacteria suggests that the mutation rate can be affected by translation errors and expression noise in various proteins. Importantly, this non-genetic variation may be heritable via a transgenerational epigenetic mode of inheritance, giving rise to a mutator phenotype that is independent from mutator alleles. Here we investigate mathematically how the rate of adaptive evolution is affected by the rate of mutation rate phenotype switching. We model an asexual population with two mutation rate phenotypes, non-mutator and mutator. An offspring may switch from its parental phenotype to the other phenotype. We find that switching rates that correspond to so-far empirically described non-genetic systems of inheritance of the mutation rate lead to higher rates of adaptation on various fitness landscapes. These switching rates can maintain within the same individuals both a mutator phenotype and pre-existing mutations, a combination that facilitates adaptation. Moreover, non-genetic inheritance increases the proportion of mutators in the population, which in turn increases the probability of hitchhiking of the mutator phenotype with adaptive mutations. This in turns facilitates the acquisition of additional adaptive mutations. Our results rationalize recently observed noise in the expression of proteins that affect the mutation rate and suggest that non-genetic inheritance of this phenotype may facilitate evolutionary adaptive processes.",

    "abstract": "The choice of which covariates to include in a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) is important since it affects the ability to detect true association signal of variants, to correct for confounders and avoid false positives, and the running time of the analysis. Commonly used covariates include age, sex, genotyping batches, genotyping array type, as well as an arbitrary number of Principal Components (PCs) used to adjust for population structure. Despite the importance of this issue, there is no consensus or clear guidelines for the right choice of covariates. Therefore, studies typically employ heuristics for their choice with no clear justification. Here, we explore the dependence of the GWAS analysis results on the choice of covariates for a wide range of quantitative and binary human phenotypes. We propose guidelines for covariates choice based on the phenotypes type (quantitative vs. disease), the heritability, and the disease prevalence, with the goal of maximizing the statistical power to detect true associations and fit accurate polygenic scores while avoiding spurious associations and minimizing computation time. We analyze 36 traits in the UK-Biobank dataset. We show that the genotype batch and assessment center can be safely removed as covariates, thus significantly reducing the GWAS computational burden for these traits.",

    "abstract": "Natural selection acts ubiquitously on complex human traits, predominantly constraining the occurrence of extreme phenotypes (stabilizing selection). These constrains propagate to DNA sequence variants associated with traits under selection. The genetic imprints of such evolutionary events can thus be detected via combining effect size estimates from genetic association studies and the corresponding allele frequencies. While this approach has been successfully applied to high-level traits, the prevalence and mode of selection acting on molecular traits remains poorly understood. Here, we estimate the action of natural selection on genetic variants associated with metabolite levels, an important layer of molecular traits. By leveraging summary statistics of published genome-wide association studies with large sample sizes, we find strong evidence of stabilizing selection for 15 out of 97 plasma metabolites, with an overrepresentation of amino acids among such cases. Mendelian randomization analysis revealed that metabolites under stronger stabilizing selection display larger effects on key cardiometabolic traits, suggesting that maintaining a healthy cardiometabolic profile may be an important source of selective constraints on the metabolome. Metabolites under strong stabilizing selection in humans are also more conserved in their concentrations among diverse mammalian species, suggesting shared selective forces across micro and macroevolutionary time scales. Finally, we also found evidence for both disruptive and directional selection on specific lipid metabolites, potentially indicating ongoing evolutionary adaptation in humans. Overall, this study demonstrates that variation in metabolite levels among humans is frequently shaped by natural selection and this may be acting indirectly through maintaining cardiometabolic fitness.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by the study of genetic effect modifiers of cancer, we examined weighting approaches to correct for ascertainment bias in survival analysis. Family-based outcome-dependent sampling is common in genetic epidemiology leading to study samples with too many events in comparison to the population and an overrepresentation of young, affected subjects. A usual approach to correct for ascertainment bias in this setting is to use an inverse probability-weighted Cox model, using weights based on external available population-based age-specific incidence rates of the type of cancer under investigation. However, the current approach is not general enough leading to invalid weights in relevant practical settings if oversampling of cases is not observed in all age groups. Based on the same principle of weighting observations by their inverse probability of selection, we propose a new, more general approach. We show the advantage of our new method using simulations and two real datasets. In both applications the goal is to assess the association between common susceptibility loci identified in Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and cancer (colorectal and breast) using data collected through genetic testing in clinical genetics centers.",

We probed the function of eight candidate enhancers through experimental mouse genetics. Deletion of the super-enhancer led to a 98% reduced expression of Csn3 and Fdcsp in mammary and salivary glands, respectively, and Odam expression was abolished in both tissues. The other three casein genes were only marginally affected. Notably, super-enhancer activity requires the additional presence of a distal Csn3-specific enhancer.

    "abstract": "In 1970, the Southern Corn Leaf Blight epidemic ravaged US fields to great economic loss. The outbreak was caused by never-before-seen, super-virulent, Race T of the fungus Cochliobolus heterostrophus. The functional difference between Race T and O, the previously known, far less aggressive strain, is production of T-toxin, a host-selective polyketide. Super-virulence is associated with [~]1 Mb of Race T- specific DNA; only a fraction encodes T-toxin biosynthetic genes (Tox1). Tox1 is genetically and physically complex, with unlinked loci (Tox1A, Tox1B) genetically inseparable from breakpoints of a Race O reciprocal translocation that generated hybrid Race T chromosomes. Previously, we identified ten genes for T-toxin biosynthesis. Unfortunately, high depth, short-read sequencing placed these genes on four small, unconnected scaffolds surrounded by repeated A+T rich sequence, concealing context. To sort out Tox1 topology and pinpoint the hypothetical Race O translocation breakpoints corresponding to Race T-specific insertions, we undertook PacBio long-read sequencing which revealed Tox1 gene arrangement and the breakpoints. Six Tox1A genes are arranged as three small islands in a Race T-specific sea ([~]634 kb) of repeats. Four Tox1B genes are linked, on a large loop of Race T-specific DNA ([~]210 kb). The race O breakpoints are short sequences of race O-specific DNA; corresponding positions in race T are large insertions of race T-specific, A+T rich DNA, often with similarity to transposable (predominantly Gypsy) elements. Nearby, are  Voyager Starship elements and DUF proteins. These elements may have facilitated Tox1 integration into progenitor Race O and promoted large scale recombination resulting in race T.\n\nImportanceIn 1970 a corn disease epidemic ravaged fields in the US to great economic loss. The outbreak was caused by a never-before seen, super-virulent strain of the fungal pathogen Cochliobolus heterostrophus. This was a plant disease epidemic, however, the current COVID-19 pandemic of humans is a stark reminder that novel, highly virulent, pathogens evolve with devastating consequences, no matter what the host-animal, plant, or other organism. Long read DNA sequencing technology allowed in depth structural comparisons between the sole, previously known, much less aggressive, version of the pathogen and the super-virulent version and revealed, in meticulous detail, the structure of the unique virulence-causing DNA. These data are foundational for future analysis of mechanisms of DNA acquisition from a foreign source.",

    "abstract": "The very first days of mammalian embryonic development are accompanied by epigenetic reprogramming and extensive changes in nuclear organization. In particular, genomic regions located at the periphery of the nucleus, termed lamina-associated domains (LADs), undergo major rearrangements after fertilization. However, the role of LADs in regulating gene expression as well as the interplay with various chromatin marks during preimplantation development remains elusive. In this study, we obtained single-cell LAD profiles coupled with the corresponding gene expression readout throughout the first days of mouse development. We detect extensive cell-cell LAD variability at the 2-cell stage, which surprisingly does not seem to functionally affect gene expression. This suggests an unusual uncoupling between 3D-nuclear genome organization and gene expression during totipotent developmental stages. By analyzing LAD dynamics and chromatin states across early developmental stages in an allelic-specific manner, we identify genomic regions that transiently detach from the nuclear lamina and are enriched by non-canonical H3K27me3. Upon maternal knock-out of a component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 and concomitant loss of H3K27me3 during early embryogenesis, these regions relocate to the lamina at the 2-cell stage. Our results suggest that H3K27me3 is the prime determinant in establishing the atypical distribution of the genome at the nuclear periphery during the first days of embryonic development. This study provides insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating nuclear organization of parental genomes during very early mammalian development.",

The method projects red and near-infrared light through the scalp within 600-1100 nm and low energy within the 1-20 J/cm2 range. Recent studies have been optimistic about replacing this method with pharmacotherapy and invasive brain stimulation. However, concerns and ambiguities exist regarding the light penetration depth and possible thermal side effects. While the literature survey indicates that the skin temperature rises after experimental optical brain stimulation, inadequate evidence supports a safe increase in temperature or the amount of light penetration in the cortex. Therefore, we aimed to conduct a comprehensive study on the heat transfer of near-infrared stimulation for the human brain. Our research considers the transcranial photobiomodulation over the human brain model by projecting 810 nm light with 100 mW/cm2 power density to evaluate its thermal and optical effects using bioheat transfer and radiative transfer equation. Our results confirm that the near-infrared light spectrum has a small incremental impact on temperature and approximately penetrates 1 cm, reaching the cortex. A time-variant study of the heat transfer was also carried out to measure the temperature changes during optical stimulation.",

    "abstract": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play a significant role in some diseases by acting as transcription templates. Therefore, analyzing the interaction mechanism between circRNA and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) has far-reaching implications for the prevention and treatment of diseases. Existing models for circRNA-RBP identification most adopt CNN, RNN, or their variants as feature extractors. Most of them have drawbacks such as poor parallelism, insufficient stability, and inability to capture long-term dependence. To address these issues, we designed a Seq_transformer module to extract deep semantic features and then propose a CircRNA-RBP identification model based on Sequence Self-attention with Pre-normalization. We test it on 37 circRNA datasets and 31 linear RNA datasets using the same set of hyperparameters, and the overall performance of the proposed model is highly competitive and, in some cases, significantly out-performs state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model is scalable, transformable, and can be applied to a wide range of applications without the need for task-oriented fine-tuning of parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/cc646201081/CircSSNN.\n\nAuthor summaryIn this paper, we propose a new method completely using the self-attention mechanism to capture deep semantic features of RNA sequences. On this basis, we construct a CircSSNN model for the cirRNA-RBP identification. The proposed model constructs a feature scheme by fusing circRNA sequence representations with statistical distributions, static local context, and dynamic global context. With a stable and efficient network architecture, the distance between any two positions in a sequence is reduced to a constant, so CircSSNN can quickly capture the long-term dependence and extract the deep semantic features. Experiments on 37 circRNA datasets show that the proposed model has overall advantages in stability, parallelism, and prediction performance. Keeping the network structure and hyperparameters unchanged, we directly apply CircSSNN to linRNA datasets. The favorable results show that CircSSNN can be transformed simply and efficiently without task-oriented tuning. In conclusion, CircSSNN can serve as an appealing circRNA-RBP identification tool with good identification performance, excellent scalability, and wide application scope, which is expected to reduce the professional threshold required for hyperparameter tuning in bioinformatics analysis.",

    "abstract": "Disulfide bond (Dsb) proteins catalyse oxidative protein folding governing bacterial survival and virulence. Dsb systems in Escherichia coli K-12 are well-studied, yet what determines dithiol oxidase or disulfide reductase activity remains unknown. Past studies suggest oligomerisation of periplasmic thiol oxidoreductases dictates the direction of thiol catalytic activity. Here, we studied three suppressor-of-copper-sensitivity C (ScsC) Dsb-like proteins known to exist in the reduced state and bind to copper. These proteins adopt different quaternary structures: Salmonella enterica ScsC (StScsC) is monomeric, while ScsC from Proteus mirabilis (PmScsC) and Caulobacter crescentus (CcScsC) are trimeric. When expressed in the model organism E. coli K-12, we showed that all three ScsC proteins exhibit both dithiol oxidation and disulfide reduction activity, despite structural differences. Interestingly, while ScsC reductase function was supported by the canonical E. coli DsbD reductase, oxidase activity depended on environmental oxidation. However, an engineered monomeric PmScsC synergises with E. coli DsbB to gain dithiol oxidase activity at the expense of reductase function. Thus, oligomerisation could be one mechanism by which ScsC proteins avoid interactions with the periplasmic thiol oxidase pathway. This tightly controls their re-oxidation and maintains ScsC proteins in the reduced state required for binding and sequestering toxic levels of cellular copper.",

    "abstract": "West Nile virus (WNV) and Usutu virus (USUV) are two arthropod-borne viruses that circulate in mainland France. Assessing vector competence has only been conducted so far with mosquitoes from southern France while an increasingly active circulation of WNV and USUV has been reported in the last years. The main vectors are mosquitoes of the Culex genus and the common mosquito Culex pipiens. Here, we measure the vector competence of five mosquito species (Aedes rusticus, Aedes albopictus, Anopheles plumbeus, Culex pipiens and Culiseta longiareolata) present in northeastern France. Field-collected populations were exposed to artificial infectious blood meal containing WNV or USUV and examined at different days post-infection. We show that (i) Cx. pipiens transmitted WNV and USUV, (ii) Ae. rusticus only WNV, and (iii) unexpectedly, Ae. albopictus transmitted both WNV and USUV. Less surprising, An. plumbeus was not competent for both viruses. Combined with data on distribution and population dynamics, these assessments of vector competence will help in developing a risk map and implementing appropriate prevention and control measures.\n\nAuthor summaryWest Nile virus (WNV) and Usutu virus (USUV) are on the rise in Europe and in France. WNV is reported in France as early as the 1960s in the Camargue and USUV more recently, in 2015 in eastern France. The re-emergence of WNV infections in the Camargue is associated with an expansion towards the North which is also favorable to maintain a viral transmission cycle. USUV frequently co-circulates with WNV sharing the same mosquito vectors. Culex pipiens, able to feed on birds and humans, is considered to be the main vector in France. Our study is the first to investigate the vector competence to WNV and USUV of five different mosquito species collected in northeastern France. We ascertain that French Cx. pipiens mosquitoes are competent to both WNV and USUV. More surprisingly, the mosquito Aedes albopictus from northeastern France was able to transmit WNV and USUV. Based on our result, we propose that surveillance of mosquitoes combined with viral detections must be implemented in northeastern France to allow early viral detection and timely intervention to prevent outbreaks of these two neurological diseases.",

To determine its possible in vivo activities, Arh2-knockout (KO) and - heterozygous (Het) mice were generated using CRISPR-Cas9. Arh2-KO mice exhibited decreased cardiac contractility by MRI, echocardiography and dobutamine stress with cardiomegaly and abnormal motor function. Arh2-Het mice showed results similar to those seen in Arh2-KO mice except for cardiomegaly. Arh2-KO and -Het mice and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) developed spontaneous tumors and subcutaneous tumors in nude mice. We identified 13 mutations in Arh2-Het MEFs and heterozygous tumors, corresponding to human ARH2 mutations in cancers obtained from COSMIC. Of interest, the L116R mutation in Arh2 gene plays a critical role in aggressive tumorigenesis in nude mice, corresponding to human ARH2 mutations in stomach adenocarcinoma. Both genders of Arh2-KO and -Het mice showed increased unexpectedly deaths and decreased survival rate during a 24-month observation, caused by tumor, inflammation, non-inflammation (e.g., cardiomegaly, dental dysplasia), and congenital diseases. Thus, Arh2 plays a pivotal role in cardiac function, tumorigenesis, inflammation, and overall survival.",

    "abstract": "Integration of genome-scale metabolic networks with reactive transport models (RTMs) is an advanced simulation technique that enables predicting the changes of microbial growth and metabolism in space and time. Despite promising demonstrations in the past, computational inefficiency has been pointed out as a critical issue to overcome because it requires repeated implementation of linear programming (LP) to get flux balance analysis (FBA) solutions in every time step and every spatial grid. To address this challenge, we propose a new simulation method where we train/validate artificial neural networks (ANNs) using FBA solutions randomly sampled and incorporate the resulting reduced-order FBA model (represented as algebraic equations) into RTMs as source/sink terms. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method via a case study of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 strain. During the aerobic growth on lactate, S. oneidensis produces metabolic byproducts (such as pyruvate and acetate), which are subsequently consumed as alternative carbon sources when the preferred ones are depleted. Simulating such intricate dynamics posed a considerable challenge, which we overcame by adopting the cybernetic approach that describes metabolic switches as the outcome of dynamic competition among multiple growth options. In both zero-dimensional batch and one-dimensional column configurations, the ANN-based reduced-order models achieved substantial reduction of computational time by several orders of magnitude compared to the original LP-based FBA models. Importantly, the ANN models produced robust solutions without any special measures to prevent numerical instability. These developments significantly promote our ability to utilize genome-scale networks in complex, multi-physics, and multi-dimensional ecosystem modeling.",

    "abstract": "Male subjects in animal and human studies are disproportionately used for toxicological testing. This discrepancy is evidenced in clinical medicine where females are more likely than males to experience liver-related adverse events in response to xenobiotics. While previous work has shown gene expression differences between the sexes, there is a lack of systems-level approaches to understand the direct clinical impact effect of these differences. Here, we integrate gene expression data with metabolic network models to characterize the impact of transcriptional changes of metabolic genes in the context of sex differences and drug treatment. We used Tasks Inferred from Differential Expression (TIDEs), a reaction-centric approach to analyzing differences in gene expression, to discover that androgen, ether lipid, glucocorticoid, tryptophan, and xenobiotic metabolism have more activity in the male liver, and serotonin, melatonin, pentose, glucuronate, and vitamin A metabolism have more activity in the female liver. When TIDEs is used to compare expression differences in treated and untreated hepatocytes, we see little response in those sex-altered subsystems, and the largest differences are in subsystems related to lipid metabolism. Finally, using sex-specific transcriptomic data, we create individual and averaged male and female liver models and find differences in the import of bile acids and salts. This result suggests that the sexually dimorphic behavior of the liver may be caused by differences in enterohepatic recirculation, and we suggest an investigation into sex-specific microbiome composition as an avenue of further research.\n\nAuthor SummaryMale-bias in clinical testing of drugs has led to a disproportionate number of hepatotoxic events in women. Previous works use gene-by-gene differences in biological sex to explain this discrepancy, but there is little focus on the systematic interactions of these differences. To this end, we use a combination of gene expression data and metabolic modeling to compare metabolic activity between the male and female liver and treated and untreated hepatocytes. We find several subsystems with differential activity in each sex; however, when comparing these subsystems with those pathways altered by hepatotoxic agents, we find little overlap. To explore these differences on a reaction-by-reaction basis, we use the same sex-specific transcriptomic data to contextualize the previously published Human1 human cell metabolic model. In these models we find a difference in flux for the import of bile acids and salts, suggesting a potential difference in enterohepatic circulation. These findings can help guide future drug design, toxicological testing, and sex-specific research to better account for the entire human population.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDepressive symptoms are prevalent and precedes cognitive decline in Alzheimers disease (AD), which worsen the clinical outcome and severely challenge the life quality of the patients. However, the neural circuitry mediating mood disturbance in AD remains elusive. Here we report that the glutamatergic projection from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to the ventral hippocampal CA1 (vCA1) acts as the neural substrate of depressive symptoms in AD. We systemically mapped axonal projection in early stage of 5xFAD mice (3 months), which accompanies depressive- like behavior in these animals and identified reduced axonal projection from ACC to vCA1. This is in accordance with reduced axonal calcium signals detected with in vivo fiber photometry. Chemogenetic or optogenetic reversal of ACC-vCA1 circuitry activity efficiently ameliorated the depressive-like behaviors as well as cognitive impairment in 5xFAD mice. We further identified the synaptic molecules neuregulin-1 (Nrg1) as one vital signal regulating the synaptic glutamate transmission from the ACC to the vCA1. Collectively, these results indicated ACC-vCA1 as a critical pathway that regulates emotional states in Alzheimer disease. Targeting cingulate cortices with brain stimulation may treat depression in AD.",

However, the role of EZH2 in T cell exhaustion remains under-explored. Here, using in vitro exhaustion models, we demonstrated that transient inhibition of EZH2 in T cells before the phenotypic onset of exhaustion with a clinically approved inhibitor, Tazemetastat, delayed their dysfunctional progression and maintained T cell stemness and polyfunctionality while having no negative impact on cell proliferation. Tazemetestat induced T cell epigenetic reprogramming and increased the expression of the self-renewing T cell transcription factor TCF1 by reducing its promoter H3K27 methylation preferentially in rapidly dividing T cells. In a murine melanoma model, T cells pre-treated with tazemetastat exhibited a superior response to anti-PD-1 blockade therapy after adoptive transfer. Collectively, these data unveil the potential of transient epigenetic reprogramming as a potential intervention to be combined with checkpoint blockade for immune therapy.",

    "abstract": "Innate immune responses are crucial for limiting virus infection. However, viruses often hijack our best defenses for viral objectives. Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a beta herpesvirus which establishes a life-long latent infection. Defining the virus-host interactions controlling latency and reactivation is vital to the control of viral disease risk posed by virus reactivation. We defined an interaction between UL138, a pro-latency HCMV gene, and the host deubiquintase complex, UAF1-USP1. UAF1 is a scaffold protein pivotal for the activity of ubiquitin specific peptidases (USP), including USP1. UAF1-USP1 sustains an innate immune response through the phosphorylation and activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (pSTAT1), as well as regulates the DNA damage response. After the onset of viral DNA synthesis, pSTAT1 levels are elevated and this depends upon UL138 and USP1. pSTAT1 localizes to viral centers of replication, binds to the viral genome, and influences UL138 expression. Inhibition of USP1 results in a failure to establish latency, marked by increased viral genome replication and production of viral progeny. Inhibition of Jak-STAT signaling also results in increased viral genome synthesis in hematopoietic cells, consistent with a role for USP1-mediated regulation of STAT1 signaling in the establishment of latency. These findings demonstrate the importance of the UL138-UAF1-USP1 virus-host interaction in regulating HCMV latency establishment through the control of innate immune signaling. It will be important going forward to distinguish roles of UAF1-USP1 in regulating pSTAT1 relative to its role in the DNA damage response in HCMV infection.\n\nImportanceHuman cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is one of nine herpesviruses that infect humans. Following a primary infection, HCMV establishes a life-long latent infection that is marked by sporadic, and likely frequent reactivation events. While these reactivation events are asymptomatic in the immune competent host, they pose important disease risks for the immune compromised, including solid organ or stem cell transplant recipients. Its complex interactions with host biology and deep coding capacity make it an excellent model for defining mechanisms important for viral latency and reactivation. Here we define an interaction with host proteins that commandeer typically antiviral innate immune signaling for the establishment of latency.",

    "abstract": "Polymerases encoded by segmented negative-strand RNA viruses cleave 5-m7G-capped host transcripts to prime viral mRNA synthesis (  cap-snatching) to generate chimeric RNA, and trans-splicing occurs between viral and cellular transcripts. Bombyx mori cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus (BmCPV), an RNA virus belonging to Reoviridae, is a major pathogen of silkworm (B. mori). The genome of BmCPV consists of 10 segmented double-stranded RNAs (S1-S10) from which viral RNAs encoding a protein are transcribed. In this study, chimeric silkworm-BmCPV RNAs, in which the sequence derived from the silkworm transcript could fuse with both the 5 end and the 3 end of viral RNA, were identified in the midgut of BmCPV-infected silkworms by RNA_seq and further confirmed by PCR and Sanger sequencing. A novel chimeric RNA, HDAC11-S4 RNA 4, derived from silkworm histone deacetylase 11 (HDAC11) and the BmCPV S4 transcript encoding viral structural protein 4 (VP4), was selected for validation by in situ hybridization and Northern blotting. Interestingly, our results indicated that HDAC11-S4 RNA 4 was generated in a BmCPV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)-independent manner and could be translated into a truncated BmCPV VP4 with a silkworm HDAC11-derived N-terminal extension. Moreover, it was confirmed that HDAC11-S4 RNA 4 inhibited BmCPV proliferation, decreased the level of H3K9me3 and increased the level of H3K9ac. These results indicated that during infection with BmCPV, a novel mechanism, different from that described in previous reports, allows the genesis of chimeric silkworm-BmCPV RNAs with biological functions.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=130 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/527451v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (43K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b3b949org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4972c0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cc15aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16a0a19_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

In migrating cortical interneurons, nuclear movements are directed towards the centrosome that organises the primary cilium signalling hub. Primary cilium-elicited signalling, and how it affects migration, remain however ill characterised. Here, we show that altering cAMP/cGMP levels in the primary cilium by buffering cAMP, cGMP or by locally increasing cAMP, influences the polarity and directionality of migrating interneurons, whereas buffering cAMP or cGMP in the apposed centrosome compartment alters their motility. Remarkably, we identify CXCL12 as a trigger that alters the ciliary cAMP/cGMP ratio to promote sustained polarity and directed migration. We thereby uncover cAMP/cGMP levels in the primary cilium as a major target of extrinsic cues and as the steering wheel of neuronal migration.",

    "abstract": "Chicken domestication began at least 3,500 years ago for purposes of divination, cockfighting, and food. Prior to industrial scale chicken production, domestication selected larger birds with increased egg production. In the mid-20th century companies began intensive selection with the broiler (meat) industry focusing on improved feed conversion, rapid growth, and breast muscle yield. Here we present proteomic analysis comparing the Ross 708 modern broiler line with the UIUC legacy line. Comparing the breast muscle proteome between modern broilers and legacy lines not selected for these growth traits identifies cellular processes that have responded to human directed evolution. Mass spectrometry was used to identify differences in protein levels in the breast muscle of 6-day old chicks from Modern and Legacy lines. The results highlighted elevated levels of stress proteins, ribosomal proteins, and proteins that participate in the innate immune pathway in the Modern chickens. Furthermore, the comparative analyses indicated differences in the levels of proteins involved in multiple biochemical pathways. In particular, the Modern line had elevated levels of proteins affecting the pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle, and fatty acid oxidation and reduced protein levels of the first phase of glycolysis. These analyses provide hypotheses linking the morphometric changes driven by human directed selection to biochemical pathways. The results also have implications for the onset of Wooden Breast disease that arose due to selection for rapid breast muscle growth and is a major problem in the poultry industry.",

In this study, the comparative analysis of Malassezia mitogenomes contributed to phylogenetic tree construction for all species. The mitogenomes presented significant size and gene order diversity which correlates to their phylogeny. Most importantly, they showed the inclusion of Large Inverted Repeats (LIRs) and G-quadruplex (G4) DNA elements, rendering Malassezia mitogenomes a valuable test case for elucidating the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for this genome diversity. Both LIRs and G4s coexist and convergently evolved to provide genome stability through recombination. This mechanism is common in chloroplasts but, hitherto, rarely found in mitogenomes.",

In this study, we used apolipoprotein E deficient (ApoE -/-) mice to investigate the vascular impact and plasma metabolic signature of a very high-fat KD compared to a non-ketogenic high-fat diet (HFD). Plasma samples were collected after 4, 8, and 12 weeks on the experimental diets and used to quantify the major ketone body {beta}-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 6, IL-6; monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, MCP-1; and tumor necrosis factor , TNF-), and targeted metabolomic profiling by mass spectrometry. Moreover, aortic atherosclerotic lesions were quantified ex vivo by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on a 14-tesla system. The results showed that, relative to HFD mice, the KD mice had markedly higher levels of BHB and lower levels of cytokines, confirming the presence of ketosis that alleviated the well-established fat-induced systemic inflammation. Moreover, mice under nutritional ketosis displayed a distinct plasma amino acid profile evidencing a KD-induced alteration in protein metabolism. Significant changes in the plasma metabolome in KD mice included a decrease in lipophilic and increase in hydrophilic metabolites. Despite the higher fat content of the KD versus the HFD, KD mice presented significantly lower levels of several lipid metabolites, including phosphatidylcholines, cholesterol esters, sphingomyelins, and ceramides. Consistent with the shift in energy metabolism toward fatty acid oxidation caused by the KD, the ratio of acylcarnitines to free carnitine was significantly higher in KD than in HFD mice., the aortic plaque burden was significantly lower in the KD versus the HFD group. In conclusion, nutritional ketosis induced by the KD was associated with specific metabolic changes and an atheroprotective phenotype versus the HFD.",

Using in vitro systems, we found that elraglusib promotes immune cell-mediated tumor cell killing, enhances tumor cell pyroptosis, decreases tumor cell NF-{kappa}B-regulated survival protein expression, and increases immune cell effector molecule secretion. Using in vivo systems, we observed synergy between elraglusib and anti-PD-L1 in an immunocompetent murine model of colorectal cancer. Murine responders had more tumor-infiltrating T-cells, fewer tumor-infiltrating Tregs, lower tumorigenic circulating cytokine concentrations, and higher immunostimulatory circulating cytokine concentrations. To determine the clinical significance, we utilized human plasma samples from patients treated with elraglusib and correlated cytokine profiles with survival. Using paired tumor biopsies, we found that CD45+ tumor-infiltrating immune cells had lower expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints and higher expression of T-cell activation markers in post-elraglusib patient biopsies. These results introduce several immunomodulatory mechanisms of GSK-3 inhibition using elraglusib, providing a rationale for the clinical evaluation of elraglusib in combination with immunotherapy.\n\nStatement of significancePharmacologic inhibition of GSK-3 using elraglusib sensitizes tumor cells, activates immune cells for increased anti-tumor immunity, and synergizes with anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade.

    "abstract": "PurposeDue to a demonstrated lack of DNA repair deficiencies, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) has not benefitted from targeted synthetic lethality-based therapies. We investigated whether nucleotide excision repair (NER) deficiency is present in an identifiable subset of ccRCC cases that would render those tumors sensitive to therapy targeting this specific DNA repair pathway aberration.\n\nExperimental DesignWe used functional assays that detect UV-induced 6-4 pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts to quantify NER deficiency in ccRCC cell lines. We also measured sensitivity to irofulven, an experimental cancer therapeutic agent that specifically targets cells with inactivated transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER). In order to detect NER deficiency in clinical biopsies, we assessed whole exome sequencing data for the presence of an NER deficiency associated mutational signature previously identified in ERCC2 mutant bladder cancer.\n\nResultsFunctional assays showed NER deficiency in ccRCC cells. Irofulven sensitivity increased in some cell lines. Prostaglandin reductase 1 (PTGR1), which activates irofulven, was also associated with this sensitivity. Next generation sequencing data of the cell lines showed NER deficiency-associated mutational signatures. A significant subset of ccRCC patients had the same signature and high PTGR1 expression.\n\nConclusionsccRCC cell line based analysis showed that NER deficiency is likely present in this cancer type. Approximately 10% of ccRCC patients in the TCGA cohort showed mutational signatures consistent with ERCC2 inactivation associated NER deficiency and also substantial levels of PTGR1 expression. These patients may be responsive to irofulven, a previously abandoned anticancer agent that has minimal activity in NER-proficient cells.\n\nTranslational relevanceDNA repair deficiencies can be therapeutically targeted by synthetic lethal-based strategies in cancer. However, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) has not benefitted from this therapeutic approach due to a lack of evidence for the presence of specific DNA repair pathway deficiencies. Here, we demonstrate that ccRCC harbors a therapeutically targetable DNA repair pathway aberration, nucleotide excision repair (NER) deficiency. ccRCC cell lines displayed robust signs of NER deficiency as determined by functional assays and some of these cell lines also displayed NER deficiency induced mutational signatures. These cell lines are also sensitive to irofulven, an abandoned anticancer agent that creates DNA lesions which can only be repaired by the NER pathway. We estimate that up to 10% of ccRCC cases may respond to NER-directed therapy with irofulven based on NER deficiency associated mutational signatures and PTGR1 expression levels, which is an enzyme required to activate irofulven.",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of several highly efficacious SARS-CoV-2 vaccines was an unprecedented scientific achievement that saved millions of lives. However, now that SARS-CoV-2 is transitioning to the endemic stage, there exists an unmet need for new vaccines that provide durable immunity, protection against variants, and can be more easily manufactured and distributed. Here we describe a novel protein component vaccine candidate, MT-001, based on a fragment of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that encompasses the receptor binding domain (RBD). Mice and hamsters immunized with a prime-boost regimen of MT-001 demonstrated extremely high anti-spike IgG titers, and remarkably this humoral response did not appreciably wane for up to 12 months following vaccination. Further, virus neutralization titers, including titers against variants such as Delta and Omicron BA.1, remained high without the requirement for subsequent boosting. MT-001 was designed for manufacturability and ease of distribution, and we demonstrate that these attributes are not inconsistent with a highly immunogenic vaccine that confers durable and broad immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and its emerging variants. These properties suggest MT-001 could be a valuable new addition to the toolbox of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and other interventions to prevent infection and curtail additional morbidity and mortality from the ongoing worldwide pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Infant antibody responses to viral infection can differ from those in adults. However, data on the specificity and function of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in infants, and direct comparisons between infants and adults are limited. We characterized antibody binding and functionality in convalescent plasma from postpartum women and their infants infected with SARS-CoV-2 from a vaccine-naive prospective cohort in Nairobi, Kenya. Antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 Spike, receptor binding domain and N-terminal domain, and Spike-expressing cell-surface staining levels were significantly higher in infants than in mothers. Plasma antibodies from mothers and infants bound to similar regions of the Spike S2 subunit, including the fusion peptide (FP) and stem helix-heptad repeat 2. However, infants displayed higher antibody levels and more consistent antibody escape pathways in the FP region compared to mothers. Finally, infants had significantly higher levels of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), though, surprisingly, neutralization titers between infants and mothers were similar. These results suggest infants develop distinct SARS-CoV-2 binding and functional antibody repertoires and reveal age-related differences in humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection that could be relevant to protection and COVID-19 disease outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Waves of breakthrough infections by SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants pose a global challenge to pandemic control today. We have previously reported a pVAX1-based DNA vaccine candidate, pAD1002, which encodes a receptor-binding domain (RBD) chimera of SARS-CoV-1 and Omicron BA.1. In mouse and rabbit models, pAD1002 plasmid induced cross-neutralizing Abs against heterologous Sarbecoviruses, including SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 prototype, Delta and Omicron variants. However, these antisera failed to block the recent emerging Omicron subvariants BF.7 and BQ.1. To solve this problem, we replaced the BA.1-encoding DNA sequence in pAD1002 with that of BA.4/5. The resulting construct, namely pAD1016, elicited SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IFN-{gamma}+ cellular responses in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. More importantly, pAD1016 vaccination in mice and rabbits generated serum Abs capable of neutralizing pseudoviruses representing multiple SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants including BA.2, BA.4/5, BF.7, BQ.1 and XBB. As a booster vaccine for inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus preimmunization in C57BL/6 mice, pAD1016 broadened the serum Ab neutralization spectrum to cover the Omicron BA.4/5, BF7 and BQ.1 subvariants. These data highlight the potential benefit of pAD1016 in eliciting neutralizing Abs against broad spectrum Omicron subvariants in individuals previously vaccinated with inactivated prototype SARS-CoV-2 virus and suggests that pAD1016 is worthy further translational study as a COVID-19 vaccine candidate.",

    "abstract": "Lag phase is observed in bacterial growth during a sudden change in conditions: growth is inhibited whilst cells adapt to the environment. Bi-phasic, or diauxic growth is commonly exhibited by many species. In the presence of two sugars, cells initially grow by consuming the preferred sugar then undergo a lag phase before resuming growth on the second. Biomass increase is characterised by a diauxic growth curve: exponential growth followed by a period of no growth before a second exponential growth. Recent literature lacks a complete dynamic description, artificially modelling lag phase and employing non-physical representations of precursor pools. Here, we focus on glucoselactose diauxie of Escherichia coli formulating a rational mechanistic model based on flux-regulation/proteome partitioning with a finite precursor pool that reveals core mechanisms in a compact form. Unlike earlier systems, the characteristic dynamics emerge as part of the solution, including the lag phase, and results accurately reproduce experiments. We show that for a single strain of E. coli, diauxic growth yields mathematically optimised growth rates. However, intriguingly, for two competing strains diauxic growth is not always the best strategy. Our description can be generalised to model multiple different microorganisms and investigate competition between species/strains.",

    "abstract": "One of the tenets of molecular biology is that dynamical transitions between three dimensional structures largely determine the function of individual proteins, as well as multi-protein assemblies. Therefore, it seems only natural that evolutionary analysis of proteins, presently based mainly on their primary sequence, needs to shift its focus towards their function as assessed by corresponding structural transitions. This can been facilitated by recent progress in cryogenic electron microscopy that provides atomic structures of multiple conformational states for multi-protein assemblies isolated from evolutionarily related species. In this work, we study evolutionary conservation of (multi)protein function by using mechanical strain as a quantitative footprint of structural transitions. We adopt the formalism of finite strain analysis, developed in condensed matter physics and engineering, and apply it, as a case study, to a classical multi-protein assembly, the ATP synthase. Our Protein Strain Analysis (PSA) provides a precise characterization of rotation domains that agrees with the present biophysical knowledge. In addition, we obtain a strain distribution on the protein structure associated with functional transitions. By analyzing in detail the strain patterns of the {beta} chains responsible for ATP synthesis across different species, we show that they are evolutionarily conserved for the same functional transition. Such conservation is not revealed by displacement or rotation patterns. Furthermore, within each functional transition, we are able to identify conserved strain patterns for ATP synthases isolated from different organisms. Our results promote strain as an important quantity close to protein function, which is independent of structural alignments and coordinate systems. The observed strain conservation across evolutionary distant species indicates that this quantity should be essential in future structure-based evolutionary studies of protein (and multi-protein assembly) function.\n\nPACS numbers",

    "abstract": "The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by the emergence of new variants with a sheer number of mutations compared to their predecessors, which conferred resistance to pre-existing antibodies and/or increased transmissibility. The recently emerged Omicron subvariants also exhibit a strong tendency for immune evasion, suggesting adaptive evolution. However, previous studies have been limited to specific lineages or subsets of mutations, the overall evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 and the underlying driving forces are still not fully understood. In this study, we analyzed the mutations present in all open-access SARS-CoV-2 genomes (until November 2022) and correlated the mutations incidence and fitness change with its impact on immune evasion and ACE2 binding affinity. Our results showed that the Omicron lineage had an accelerated mutation rate in the RBD region, while the mutation incidence in other genomic regions did not change dramatically over time. Moreover, mutations in the RBD region (but not in any other genomic regions) exhibited a lineage-specific pattern and tended to become more aggregated over time, and the mutation incidence was positively correlated with the strength of antibody pressure on the specific position. Additionally, the incidence of mutation was also positively correlated with changes in ACE2 binding affinity, but with a lower correlation coefficient than with immune evasion. In contrast, the mutations effect on fitness was more closely correlated with changes in ACE2 binding affinity than immune evasion. In conclusion, our results suggest that immune evasion and ACE2 binding affinity play significant and diverse roles in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "C4 photosynthesis has arisen in over sixty lineages of angiosperms. Despite significant variation in characteristics of the C4 leaf, in all cases a compartment rich in chloroplasts allows high concentrations of CO2 to be supplied to RuBisCO. In most C4 lineages this is associated with increased chloroplast content of bundle sheath cells. As characteristics of C4 leaves are derived from processes operating in the ancestral C3 state, we studied greening of the bundle sheath in C3 rice. Total visible chloroplast area in bundle sheath and mesophyll cells was similar but the larger volume of bundle sheath cells reduced the proportion of cell occupied by chloroplast, and the longest bundle sheath cells had the lowest chloroplast content. Application of exogenous cytokinin and gibberellin increased chloroplast content of the longest bundle sheath cells but did not change cell shape. In contrast, delayed exposure to light reduced the number of very long bundle sheath cells but increased leaf length indicating delayed exit from the cell cycle. We conclude that in the C3 state, the plant hormones cytokinin and gibberellin are regulators of the bundle sheath cell-chloroplast relationship and that final bundle sheath length is affected by light-mediated control of exit from the cell cycle.\n\nHighlightExtended darkness can reduce maximum bundle sheath cell length in rice and hormones condition the set-point between cell size and chloroplast content.",

Gut commensals evolve and can adapt at a rapid pace when colonizing healthy hosts. Here, we aimed at assessing the impact of host-to-host bacterial transmission on Escherichia coli evolution in the mammalian gut. Using an in vivo experimental evolution approach in mice, we found a transmission rate of 7% ({+/-}3% 2SE) of E. coli cells per day between hosts inhabiting the same household. Consistent with the predictions of a simple population genetics model of mutation-selection-migration, the level of shared events resulting from within host evolution is greatly enhanced in co-housed mice, showing that hosts undergoing the same diet and habit are not only expected to have similar microbiome species compositions but also similar microbiome evolutionary dynamics. Furthermore, we estimated the rate of mutation accumulation of E. coli to be 2.9x10-3 ({+/-}5x10-4 2SE) mutations/genome/generation, irrespective of the social context of the regime. Our results reveal the impact of bacterial migration across hosts in shaping the adaptive evolution of new strains colonizing gut microbiomes.",

Patients with CIPN primarily present with sensory symptoms, such as sensory disturbances that may progress to neuropathic pain in hands and feet. While pivotal for routine cancer treatment, paclitaxel and vincristine frequently cause CIPN and impact the quality of life among cancer patients and survivors. We utilized a model of human sensory neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-SNs) to provide mechanistic understanding of CIPN caused by paclitaxel and vincristine. The morphological phenotype of iPSC-SNs following paclitaxel exposure was characterized by retraction and thickening of axons while vincristine caused fragmentation and abolishment of axons. Both agents increased the mRNA expression of the pain receptor, transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV1), and highly induced neuronal damage, as measured by activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) mRNA. iPSC-SNs express the efflux transporters, P-glycoprotein (P-gp, encoded by ABCB1) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MPR1, encoded by ABCC1). Inhibition of P-gp and MRP1 in iPSC-SNs exacerbated neurotoxicity of paclitaxel and vincristine respectively. We further show that pre-treatment with the P-gp inducer rifampicin alleviated chemotherapy-induced structural and transcriptional alterations in iPSC-SNs. iPSC-SNs are a valuable and robust model to study the role of efflux transporters and other mechanistic targets in CIPN. Efflux transporters play a critical role in CIPN pathogenesis as they regulate the disposition of chemotherapy to the peripheral nervous system.",

But how proteins with random amino acid sequences integrate into existing cellular pathways to provide a benefit remains poorly understood. Here, we screened [~]108 random genes for their ability to rescue growth arrest of E. coli cells producing the ribonuclease toxin MazF. Approximately 2,000 random genes could promote growth by reducing transcription from the promoter driving mazF expression. Additionally, one gene, named random antitoxin of MazF (ramF), whose protein product was well-tolerated in cells and neutralized MazF by interacting with chaperones, leading to MazF proteolysis. We show that the specificity of RamF for MazF relative to other toxins relies on the degron-like function of MazFs first 10 amino acids. Finally, we demonstrate that random proteins can improve during evolution by identifying beneficial mutations that turned RamF into a more efficient inhibitor.

    "abstract": "Most of the animal pollination is realized by insects, interactions between them and flowering plants have been hypothesized to be important drivers of diversification. Yet, there is weak support for coevolutionary diversification in plant-pollinator interactions. Macroevolutionary studies on insect and plant diversities support the hypothesis that angiosperms evolved after an insect diversity peak in the Early Cretaceous, suggesting that gymnosperm pollinators may have been accessible for angiosperms when they evolved. We examined fossil and phylogenetic evidence documenting this hypothesis and provide new clues on the impact of angiosperm radiation on insect diversification. Using the family-level fossil record of insects and a Bayesian process-based approach, we estimated diversification rates and the role of six different variables on insect macroevolutionary history. We found that, among the six tested variables, angiosperms had a dual role that has changed through time with an attenuation of insect extinction in the Cretaceous and a driver of insect origination in the Cenozoic. However, increasing insect diversity, spore plants and global temperature also showed strong positive correlation with both origination and extinction rates of insects, suggesting that different drivers had important effect on insect evolution, not just angiosperms, which would deserve further studies.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a pandemic of unprecedented extent. Beside humans, a number of animal species can be infected, however, in some species differing susceptibilities were observed depending on the virus variant. Here, we serologically investigated cats and dogs living in households with human COVID-19 patients. The study was conducted during the transition period from delta as the dominating variant of concern (VOC) to omicron (BA.1/BA.2) to investigate the frequency of virus transmission of both VOCs from infected owners to their pets. The animal sera were tested by surrogate virus neutralization tests (sVNT) using either the original receptor-binding domain (RBD), enabling the detection of antibodies against the delta variant, or an omicron-specific RBD. Of the 290 canine samples, 20 tested positive by sVNT, but there were marked differences between the sampling time, and, related thereto, the virus variants, the dogs had contact to. While in November 2021 infected owners led to 50% seropositive dogs (18/36), only 0.8% (2/254) of animals with household contacts to SARS-CoV-2 between December 2021 and April 2022 tested positive. In all cases, the positive reaction was recorded against the original RBD. For cats, a similar pattern was seen, as in November 2021 38.1% (16/42) tested positive and between December 2021 and March 2022 only 5.0% (10/199). The markedly reduced ratio of seropositive animals during the period of omicron circulation suggests a considerably lower susceptibility of dogs and cats to this VOC.\n\nTo examine the effect of BA.2, BA.4 and BA.5 omicron subvariants, sera taken in the second and third quarter of 2022 from randomly selected cats were investigated. 2.3% (11/372) tested seropositive and all of them showed a stronger reaction against the original RBD, further supporting the assumption of a lower susceptibility of companion animals to the omicron VOC.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge of who infected whom during an outbreak of an infectious disease is important to determine risk factors for transmission and to design effective control measures. Both whole-genome sequencing of pathogens and epidemiological data provide useful information about the transmission events and underlying processes. Existing models to infer transmission trees usually assume that the pathogen is introduced only once from outside into the population of interest. However, this is not always true. For instance, SARS-CoV-2 is suggested to be introduced multiple times in mink farms in the Netherlands from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic among humans. Here, we developed a Bayesian inference method combining whole-genome sequencing data and epidemiological data, allowing for multiple introductions of the pathogen in the population. Our method does not a priori split the outbreak into multiple phylogenetic clusters, nor does it break the dependency between the processes of mutation, within-host dynamics, transmission, and observation. We implemented our method as an additional feature in the R-package phybreak. On simulated data, our method identifies the number of introductions with high accuracy. Moreover, when a single introduction was simulated, our method produces similar estimates of parameters and transmission trees as the existing package. When applied to data from a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Dutch mink farms, the method provides strong evidence for 13 introductions, which is 20 percent of all infected farms. Using the new feature of the phybreak package, transmission routes of a more complex class of infectious disease outbreaks can be inferred which will aid infection control in future outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "The impact of common and rare variants in COVID-19 host genetics is widely studied in [16]. Here, common and rare variants were used to define an interpretable machine learning model for predicting COVID-19 severity. Firstly, variants were converted into sets of Boolean features, depending on the absence or the presence of variants in each gene. An ensemble of LASSO logistic regression models was used to identify the most informative Boolean features with respect to the genetic bases of severity. After that, the Boolean features, selected by these logistic models, were combined into an Integrated PolyGenic Score, the so called IPGS, which offers a very simple description of the contribution of host genetics in COVID-19 severity. IPGS leads to an accuracy of 55-60% on different cohorts and, after a logistic regression with in input both IPGS and the age, it leads to an accuracy of 75%. The goal of this paper is to improve the previous results, using the information on the host organs involved in the disease. We generalized the IPGS adding a statistical weight for each organ, through the transformation of Boolean features into \"Boolean quantum features\", inspired by the Quantum Mechanics. The organs coefficients were set via the application of the genetic algorithm Pygad and, after that, we defined two new Integrated PolyGenic Score ([Formula] and [Formula]). By applying a logistic regression with both [Formula] (or indifferently [Formula]) and age as input, we reach an accuracy of 84-86%, thus improving the results previously shown in [16] by a factor of 10%.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for a global pandemic that resulted in more than 6-million deaths worldwide. The virus encodes several non-structural proteins (Nsps) that contain elements capable of disrupting cellular processes. Among these Nsp proteins, Nsp3 contains macrodomains, e.g., Mac1, Mac2, Mac3, with potential effects on host cells. Mac1 has been shown to increase SARS-CoV-2 virulence and disrupt ADP-ribosylation pathways in mammalian cells. ADP-ribosylation results from the transfer of the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD+ to various acceptors, e.g., proteins, DNA, RNA, contributing on a cells biological processes. ADP-ribosylation is the mechanism of action of bacterial toxins, e.g., Pseudomonas toxins, diphtheria toxin that disrupt protein biosynthetic and signaling pathways. On the other hand, some viral macrodomains cleavage ADP-ribose-acceptor bond, generating free ADP-ribose. By this reaction, the macrodomain-containing proteins interfere ADP-ribose homeostasis in host cells. Here, we examined potential hydrolytic activities of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1, 2, and 3 on substrates containing ADP-ribose. Mac1 cleaved -NAD+, but not {beta}-NAD+, consistent with stereospecificity at the C-1\" bond. In contrast to ARH1 and ARH3, Mac1 did not require Mg2+ for optimal activity. Mac1 also hydrolyzed O-acetyl-ADP-ribose and ADP-ribose-1\"-phosphat, but not Mac2 and Mac3. However, Mac1 did not cleave -ADP-ribose-(arginine) and ADP-ribose-(serine)-histone H3 peptide, suggesting that Mac1 hydrolyzes ADP-ribose attached to O- and N-linked functional groups, with specificity at the catalytic site in the ADP-ribose moiety. We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 may exert anti-viral activity by reversing host-mediated ADP-ribosylation. New insights on Nsp3 activities may shed light on potential SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic targets.\n\nIMPORTANCESARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, encodes 3 macrodomain-containing proteins, e.g., Mac1, Mac2, Mac3, within non-structural proteins 3 (Nsp3). Mac1 was shown previously to hydrolyze ADP-ribose-phosphate. Inactivation of Mac1 reduced viral proliferation. Here we report that Mac1, but not Mac2 and Mac3, has multiple activities, i.e., Mac1 hydrolyzed. -NAD+ and O-acetyl-ADP-ribose. However, Mac1 did not hydrolyze {beta}-NAD+, ADP-ribose-serine on a histone 3 peptide (aa1-21), and ADP-ribose-arginine, exhibiting substrate selectivity. These data suggest that Mac1 may have multi-function as a -NAD+ consumer for viral replication and a disruptor of host-mediated ADP-ribosylation pathways. Understanding Mac1s mechanisms of action is important to provide possible therapeutic targets for COVID-19.",

Here, we present a dual AAV vector technology based on reconstitution via mRNA trans-splicing (REVeRT). REVeRT is flexible in split site selection and can efficiently reconstitute different split genes in numerous in vitro models, in human organoids, and in vivo. Furthermore, REVeRT can functionally reconstitute a CRISPRa module targeting genes in various mouse tissues and organs in single or multiplexed approaches upon different routes of administration. Finally, intravitreal supplementation of ABCA4 via REVeRT improves retinal degeneration and function in a mouse model of Stargardt disease. Due to its flexibility and efficiency REVeRT harbors great potential for basic research and clinical applications.",

BLISS uses experimental deep mutational scanning data to create sequence profiles to enable deep mining of metagenomes for functional motifs which are otherwise invisible to searches. We experimentally tested 10,073 BLISS-derived sequence motifs for the receptor-binding protein of the T7 phage. The screen revealed hundreds of T7 variants with novel host specificity with functional motifs sourced from distant families besides other major phyla. Position, substitution and location preferences on T7 dictated different specificities. To demonstrate therapeutic utility, we engineered highly active T7 variants against urinary tract pathogens.

Th1 and Th17 cells are also the main drivers of crescentic glomerulonephritis, the most severe form of renal autoimmune disease. However, whether Tr1 cells emerge in renal inflammation and moreover, whether they exhibit regulatory function during glomerulonephritis has not been thoroughly investigated yet. To address these questions, we used a mouse model of experimental crescentic glomerulonephritis and double Foxp3mRFP IL-10eGFP reporter mice. We found that Foxp3neg IL-10-producing CD4+ T cells infiltrate the kidneys during glomerulonephritis progression. Using single-cell RNA- sequencing, we could show that these cells express the core transcriptional factors characteristic of Tr1 cells. In line with this, Tr1 cells showed a strong suppressive activity ex vivo and were protective in experimental crescentic glomerulonephritis in vivo. Finally, we could also identify Tr1 cells in the kidneys of patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated glomerulonephritis and define their transcriptional profile. Tr1 cells are currently used in several immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, e.g. as T- cell therapy. Thus, our study provides proof of concept for Tr1 cell-based therapies in experimental glomerulonephritis.",

In this study, we evaluated the neutralization sensitivity of a comprehensive panel of Omicron subvariants to sera from different clinical cohorts, including individuals who received homologous or heterologous booster vaccinations, vaccinated people who had Delta or BA.2 breakthrough infection in previous waves, and patients who had BA.5 or BF.7 breakthrough infection in the current wave in China.

    "abstract": "Rising numbers of malaria cases and deaths underscore the need for new interventions. Long-acting injectable medications, such as those now in use for HIV prophylaxis, offer the prospect of a malaria \"chemical vaccine\", combining the efficacy of a drug (like atovaquone) with the durability of a biological vaccine. Of concern, however, is the possible selection and transmission of drug-resistant parasites. We addressed this question by generating clinically relevant, highly atovaquone-resistant, Plasmodium falciparum mutants competent to infect mosquitoes. Isogenic paired strains, that differ only by a single Y268S mutation in cytochrome b, were evaluated in parallel in southeast Asian (Anopheles stephensi) or African (Anopheles gambiae) mosquitoes, and thence in humanized mice. Fitness costs of the mutation were evident along the lifecycle, in asexual parasite growth in vitro and in a progressive loss of parasites in the mosquito. In numerous independent experiments, microscopic exam of salivary glands from hundreds of mosquitoes failed to detect even one Y268S sporozoite, a defect not rescued by coinfection with wild type parasites. Furthermore, despite uniformly successful transmission of wild type parasites from An. stephensi to FRG NOD huHep mice bearing human hepatocytes and erythrocytes, multiple attempts with Y268S-fed mosquitoes failed: there was no evidence of parasites in mouse tissues by microscopy, in vitro culture, or PCR. These studies confirm a severe-to-lethal fitness cost of clinically relevant atovaquone-resistant P. falciparum in the mosquito, and they significantly lessen the likelihood of their transmission in the field.\n\nSignificanceNew tools are needed to protect individuals from malaria and to control malaria in the field. Atovaquone plus proguanil is a commonly used and well-tolerated medicine to prevent malaria. No drug resistance has been reported from its prophylactic use, but tablets must be taken daily. Giving atovaquone as a single injection may provide much longer-lasting protection, against both falciparum and vivax malaria, but there is concern this may create drug resistance. In this study we showed that clinically relevant atovaquone-resistant malaria parasites survive poorly, if at all, in mosquitoes, and that mosquitoes do not transmit drug-resistant parasites to humanized mice. These findings lessen the likelihood that an atovaquone \"chemical vaccine\" would lead to the spread of atovaquone resistance.",

    "abstract": "Extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistant Escherichia coli (ESC-R-Ec) is an urgent public health threat with sequence type clonal complex 131 (STc131), phylogroup B2 strains being particularly concerning as the dominant cause of ESC-R-Ec infections. To address the paucity of recent ESC-R-Ec molecular epidemiology data in the United States, we used whole genome sequencing (WGS) to fully characterize a large cohort of invasive ESC-R-Ec at a tertiary care cancer center in Houston, Texas collected from 2016-2020. During the study timeframe, there were 1154 index E. coli bloodstream infections (BSIs) of which 389 (33.7%) were ESC-R-Ec. Using time series analyses, we identified a temporal dynamic of ESC-R-Ec distinct from ESC-susceptible E. coli (ESC-S-Ec), with cases peaking in the last six months of the calendar year. WGS of 297 ESC-R-Ec strains revealed that while STc131 strains accounted for [~]45% of total BSIs, the proportion of STc131 strains remained stable across the study time frame with infection peaks driven by genetically heterogeneous ESC-R-Ec clonal complexes. BlaCTX-M variants accounted for most {beta}-lactamases conferring the ESC-R phenotype (89%; 220/248 index ESC-R-Ec), and amplification of blaCTX-M genes was widely detected in ESC-R-Ec strains, particularly in carbapenem non-susceptible, recurrent BSI strains. BlaCTX-M-55 was significantly enriched within phylogroup A strains, and we identified blaCTX-M-55 plasmid-to-chromosome transmission occurring across non-B2 strains. Our data provide important information regarding the current molecular epidemiology of invasive ESC-R-Ec infections at a large tertiary care cancer center and provide novel insights into the genetic basis of observed temporal variability for these clinically important pathogens.\n\nIMPORTANCEGiven that E. coli is the leading cause of worldwide ESC-R Enterobacterales infections, we sought to assess the current molecular epidemiology of ESC-R-Ec using a WGS analysis of many BSIs over a five-year period. We identified fluctuating temporal dynamics of ESC-R-Ec infections, which has also recently been identified in other geographical regions such as Israel. Our WGS data allowed us to visualize the stable nature of STc131 over the study period and demonstrate a limited, but genetically diverse group of ESC-R-Ec clonal complexes are detected during infection peaks. Additionally, we provide a widespread assessment of {beta}-lactamase gene copy number in ESC-R-Ec infections and delineate mechanisms by which such amplifications are achieved in a diverse array of ESC-R-Ec strains. These data suggest that serious ESC-R-Ec infections are driven by a diverse array of strains in our cohort and impacted by environmental factors suggesting that community-based monitoring could inform novel preventative measures.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular pathogens interact with host factors, exploiting those that enhance replication while countering those that suppress it. Genetic screens have begun to define the host:pathogen interface and establish a mechanistic basis for host-directed therapies. Yet, limitations of current approaches leave large regions of this interface unexplored. To uncover host factors with pro-pathogen functions, we developed a novel fitness-based screen that queries factors important during the middle-to-late stages of infection. This was achieved by engineering influenza virus to direct the screen by programing dCas9 to modulate host gene expression. A genome-wide screen identified the cytoplasmic DNA exonuclease TREX1 as a potent pro-viral factor. TREX1 normally degrades cytoplasmic DNA to prevent inappropriate innate immune activation by self DNA. Our mechanistic studies revealed that this same process functions during influenza virus infection to enhance replication. Infection triggered release of mitochondrial DNA into the cytoplasm, activating antiviral signaling via cGAS and STING. TREX1 metabolized the mitochondrial DNA preventing its sensing. Collectively, these data show that self-DNA is deployed to amplify host innate sensing during RNA virus infection, a process tempered by TREX1. Moreover, they demonstrate the power and generality of pathogen driven fitness-based screens to pinpoint key host regulators of intracellular pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Genome-scale analyses have revealed many transcription factor binding sites within, rather than upstream of genes, raising questions as to the function of these binding sites. Here, we use complementary approaches to map the regulon of the Escherichia coli transcription factor PhoB, a response regulator that controls transcription of genes involved in phosphate homeostasis. Strikingly, the majority of PhoB binding sites are located within genes, but these intragenic sites are not associated with detectable transcription regulation and are not evolutionarily conserved. Many intragenic PhoB sites are located in regions bound by H-NS, likely due to shared sequence preferences of PhoB and H-NS. However, these PhoB binding sites are not associated with transcription regulation even in the absence of H-NS. We propose that for many transcription factors, including PhoB, binding sites not associated with promoter sequences are transcriptionally inert, and hence are tolerated as genomic \"noise\".\n\nIMPORTANCERecent studies have revealed large numbers of transcription factor binding sites within the genes of bacteria. The function, if any, of the vast majority of these binding sites has not been investigated. Here, we map the binding of the transcription factor PhoB across the Escherichia coli genome, revealing that the majority of PhoB binding sites are within genes. We show that PhoB binding sites within genes are not associated with regulation of the overlapping genes. Indeed, our data suggest that bacteria tolerate the presence of large numbers of non-regulatory, intragenic binding sites for transcription factors, and that these binding sites are not under selective pressure.",

    "abstract": "Multi-omics analysis is a powerful tool for the detection and study of inter-kingdom interactions, such as those between bacterial and archaeal members of complex biogas-producing microbial communities. In the present study, the microbiomes of three industrial-scale biogas digesters, each fed with different substrates, were analysed using a machine-learning guided genome-centric metagenomics framework complemented with metatranscriptome data. This data permitted us to elucidate the relationship between abundant core methanogenic communities and their syntrophic bacterial partners. In total, we detected 297 high-quality, non-redundant metagenome-assembled genomes (nrMAGs). Moreover, the assembled 16S rRNA gene profiles of these nrMAGs showed that the phylum Firmicutes possessed the highest copy number, while the representatives of the Archaeal domain had the lowest. Further investigation of the three anaerobic microbial communities showed characteristic alterations over time but remained specific to each industrial-scale biogas plant. The relative abundance of various microbes as revealed by metagenome data were independent from corresponding metatranscriptome activity data. Interestingly, Archaea showed considerably higher activity than was expected from their abundance. We detected 53 nrMAGs that were present in all three biogas plant microbiomes with different abundances. The core microbiome correlated with the main chemical fermentation parameters and no individual parameter emerged as a predominant shaper of community composition. Various interspecies H2/electron transfer mechanisms were assigned to hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the biogas plants that ran on agricultural biomass and wastewater. Analysis of metatranscriptome data revealed that methanogenesis pathways were the most active of all main metabolic pathways. These findings highlight the importance of a combinatorial omics data framework to identify and characterise the activity of specific microbes in complex environments.",

    "abstract": "AimsPatients with ADP-ribose-acceptor hydrolase 3 (ARH3) deficiency exhibit stress-induced childhood-onset neurodegeneration with ataxia and seizures (CONDSIAS). ARH3 degrades protein-linked poly(ADP- ribose) (PAR) synthesized by poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP)-1 during oxidative stress, leading to cleavage of the ADP-ribose linked to protein. ARH3 deficiency leads to excess accumulation of PAR, resulting in PAR-dependent cell death or parthanatos. Approximately one-third of patients with homozygous mutant ARH3 die from cardiac arrest, which has been described as neurogenic, suggesting that ARH3 may play an important role in maintaining myocardial function. To address this question, cardiac function was monitored in Arh3-knockout (KO) and - heterozygous (HT) mice.\n\nMethods and resultsArh3-KO male mice displayed cardiac hypertrophy by histopathology and decreased cardiac contractility assessed by MRI. In addition, both genders of Arh3-KO and -HT mice showed decreased cardiac contractility by dobutamine stress test assessed by echocardiography. A direct role of ARH3 on myocardial function was seen with a Langendorff-perfused isolated heart model. Arh3-KO male mouse hearts showed decreased post-ischemic rate pressure products, increased size of ischemia-reperfusion (IR) infarcts, and elevated PAR levels. Consistently, in vivo IR injury showed enhanced infarct size in Arh3-KO mice in both genders. In addition, Arh3-HT male mice showed increased size of in vivo IR infarcts. Treatment with an FDA-approved PARP inhibitor, rucaparib, improved cardiac contractility during dobutamine-induced stress and exhibited reduced size of in vivo IR infarcts. To understand better the role of ARH3, CRISPR-Cas9 was used to generate different Arh3 genotypes of myoblasts and myotubes. Incubation with H2O2 decreased viability of Arh3-KO and -HT myoblasts and myotubes, resulting in PAR-dependent cell death that was reduced by PARP inhibitors or by transfection with the Arh3 gene.\n\nConclusionARH3 regulates PAR homeostasis in myocardium to preserve function and protect against oxidative stress; PARP inhibitors reduce the myocardial dysfunction seen with Arh3 mutations.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=159 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/527369v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (57K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a76514org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dd3184org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ddfd26org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16e0cd_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Baltic Sea benthic communities are characterised by low species diversity. Thus the occurrence of the habitat forming macroalga Fucus vesiculosus may influence benthic communities and promote diversity. Here we obtain biodiversity estimates through conventional and eDNA approaches for the benthic assemblages associated with free-living Fucus and the adjacent bare-sediment habitats at six sites from the Northern Baltic Proper and the Gulf of Finland. Free-living F. vesiculosus habitats are heterogeneous with biodiversity estimates varying considerably among sites. The additional habitat complexity provided by F. vesiculosus tends to improve taxa richness as a result of additional epifauna assemblages, although infaunal taxa richness and abundance is often reduced. Consequently the complex habitats provided by free-living F. vesiculosus often improves biodiversity, yet alters the composition of assemblages in soft sediment habitats and consequential ecosystem functioning. We emphasise the disparity in biodiversity estimates achieved when employing different biodiversity approaches. Biodiversity estimates were more similar within approaches compared to between habitat types, with each approach detecting exclusive taxa. We suggest that biodiversity estimates benefit from a multi-approach design where both conventional and eDNA approaches are employed in complement.",

Full-length long-read isoform cDNA sequencing after treatment with a nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) inhibitor revealed that this variant creates five distinct altered splicing transcripts. All five altered splicing transcripts have disrupted open reading frames and are subject to NMD. Furthermore, a patient-derived fibroblast line demonstrated abnormal lipid droplet formation, consistent with MFN2 dysfunction. Although correctly spliced full-length MFN2 transcripts are still produced, this branch point variant results in deficient MFN2 protein levels and autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, axonal, type 2A (CMT2A).\n\nDiscussionThis case highlights the utility of full-length isoform sequencing for characterizing the molecular mechanism of undiagnosed rare diseases and expands our understanding of the genetic basis for CMT2A.",

    "abstract": "N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) is one of the most abundant modifications found on eukaryotic mRNAs. mRNA methylation regulates a host of biological processes including meiosis, a specialized diploid cell division program that results in the formation of haploid cells (gametes). During budding yeast meiosis, m6A levels peak early, before the initiation of the meiotic divisions. High-throughput studies and work from our lab showed that Ygl036wp, a previously uncharacterized protein interacts with Kar4p, a meiotic protein required for mRNA m6A-methylation. Ygl036wp has no discernable domains except for several intrinsically disordered regions. However, protein folding prediction tools showed that Ygl036wp folds like VIRMA/Virilizer/VIR, which is involved in mRNA m6A-methylation in higher eukaryotes. In addition, Ygl036wp has several conserved motifs shared with VIRMA/Virilizer/VIR proteins. Accordingly, we propose to call the gene VIR1 for budding yeast ortholog of VIRMA/Virilizer/VIR 1. In support, Vir1p interacts with all other members of the yeast methyltransferase complex and is required for mRNA m6A methylation and meiosis. Vir1p is required for the stability of proteins comprising the methyltransferase complex, suggesting that Vir1p acts as a scaffold to stabilize the complex. The vir1{Delta}/{Delta} mutant is defective for premeiotic S-phase, which is suppressed by overexpression of the early meiotic transcription factor IME1; additional overexpression of the translational regulator RIM4 is required for sporulation.\n\nConsistent with IME1 suppression, vir1{Delta}/{Delta} exhibits a defect in the abundance of IME1 mRNA, as well as transcripts within Ime1ps regulon. Suppression by IME1 revealed a defect in the expression of the middle meiotic transcription factor, Ndt80p (and genes in its regulon), which is rescued by additional overexpression of RIM4. Together, these data suggest that Vir1p is required for cells to initiate the meiotic program and for progression through the meiotic divisions and spore formation.\n\nAuthor SummaryYgl036wp is a previously uncharacterized protein that we propose to name Vir1p (budding yeast ortholog of VIRMA/Virilizer/VIR 1). Work from our lab and others initially found an interaction between Vir1p and members of the yeast mRNA methyltransferase complex (Kar4p and Mum2p). We found that Vir1p interacts with all known members of the methyltransferase complex and is required for mRNA methylation. Vir1p is required early in meiosis; vir1{Delta}/{Delta} mutants arrest due to the reduced expression of Ime1p. Lower levels of Ime1p cause severe disruption to the meiotic transcriptome in vir1{Delta}/{Delta}. The vir1{Delta}/{Delta} meiotic defect can be partially suppressed by the overexpression of IME1; full suppression requires overexpression of both IME1 and RIM4. Using recent advances in protein folding predictions, we found that Vir1p is a remote homolog of VIRMA/Virilizer/VIR and shares conserved motifs with the protein from other organisms. Vir1p, like VIRMA/Virilizer/VIR, stabilizes the methyltransferase complex.",

    "abstract": "Messenger RNA (mRNA) has been proposed as a therapeutic agent for various diseases, including cancer. To ensure effective transfection of cancer cells, mRNA needs to be transported with a delivery system that protects its integrity and functionality. In this regard, cationic lipid nanoparticles composed of dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) and 3{beta}-[N-(N,N-dimethylaminoethane)-carbamoyl] cholesterol (DC-Chol) have emerged as common vectors to deliver mRNA. In this project, we aim to use luciferase mRNA as a reporter to synthesise mRNA-loaded cationic lipid nanoparticles, and optimise their mRNA encapsulation and transfection efficiency in ovarian cancer cells. The optimisation process included: 1) adjusting the lipid formulation; 2) adjusting the input mRNA concentration before lipid nanoparticle extrusion; and 3) adjusting the extrusion methods. After optimisation, the encapsulation efficiency was optimised to 62%, thus achieving a relatively high transfection luminescence signal (9.4 times compared to baseline). The lipid nanoparticles also demonstrated stable physical characteristics and high biocompatibility (above 75% cell viability after treatment) within 24 hours. Overall, this project evaluated the synthesis of DOPE/DC-Chol cationic lipid nanoparticles, and optimised their mRNA encapsulation and transfection efficiency in ovarian cancer cell lines. The optimised lipid nanoparticles can be utilised as an ideal system for mRNA delivery, which could be further developed as a potential platform for the immunotherapy in ovarian cancer.",

    "abstract": "Protein-protein-interactions play an important role in several cellular functions. Quantitative non-invasive techniques are applied in living cells to evaluate such interactions, thereby providing a broader understanding of complex biological processes. Fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy describes a group of quantitative microscopy approaches for the characterization of molecular interactions at single cell resolution. Through the obtained molecular brightness, it is possible to determine the oligomeric state of proteins. This is usually achieved by fusing fluorescent proteins (FPs) to the protein of interest. Recently, the number of novel green FPs has increased, with consequent improvements to the quality of fluctuation-based measurements. The photophysical behavior of FPs is influenced by multiple factors (including photobleaching, protonation-induced \"blinking\" and long-lived dark states). Assessing these factors is critical for selecting the appropriate fluorescent tag for live cell imaging applications. In this work, we focus on novel green FPs that are extensively used in live cell imaging. A systematic performance comparison of several green FPs in living cells under different pH conditions using Number & Brightness (N&B) analysis and scanning fluorescence correlation spectroscopy was performed. Our results show that the new FP Gamillus exhibits higher brightness at the cost of lower photostability and fluorescence probability (pf), especially at lower pH. mGreenLantern, on the other hand, thanks to a very high pf, is best suited for multimerization quantification at neutral pH. At lower pH, mEGFP remains apparently the best choice for multimerization investigation. These guidelines provide the information needed to plan quantitative fluorescence microscopy involving these FPs, both for general imaging or for Protein-protein-interactions quantification via fluorescence fluctuation-based methods.",

    "abstract": "Most kidney cancers display evidence of metabolic dysfunction1-4 but how this relates to cancer progression in humans is unknown. We used a multidisciplinary approach to infuse 13C-labeled nutrients during surgical tumour resection in over 70 patients with kidney cancer. Labeling from [U-13C]glucose varies across cancer subtypes, indicating that the kidney environment alone cannot account for all metabolic reprogramming in these tumours. Compared to the adjacent kidney, clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC) display suppressed labelling of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates in vivo and in organotypic slices cultured ex vivo, indicating that suppressed labeling is tissue intrinsic. Infusions of [1,2-13C]acetate and [U-13C]glutamine in patients, coupled with respiratory flux of mitochondria isolated from kidney and tumour tissue, reveal primary defects in mitochondrial function in human ccRCC. However, ccRCC metastases unexpectedly have enhanced labeling of TCA cycle intermediates compared to primary ccRCCs, indicating a divergent metabolic program during ccRCC metastasis in patients. In mice, stimulating respiration in ccRCC cells is sufficient to promote metastatic colonization. Altogether, these findings indicate that metabolic properties evolve during human kidney cancer progression, and suggest that mitochondrial respiration may be limiting for ccRCC metastasis but not for ccRCC growth at the site of origin.",

    "abstract": "It is impractical to develop a new parts collection for every potential host organism. It is well-established that gene expression parts, like genes, are qualitatively transferable, but there is little quantitative information defining transferability. Here, we systematically quantified the behavior of a parts set across multiple hosts. To do this, we developed a broad host range (BHR) plasmid system compatible with the large, modular CIDAR parts collection for E. coli. This enabled testing of a library of DNA constructs across the Pseudomonadota - Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, Cupriavidus necator, and Komagataeibacter nataicola. Part performance was evaluated with a standardized characterization procedure that quantified expression in terms of molecules of equivalent fluorescein (MEFL), an objective unit of measure. The results showed that the CIDAR parts enable graded gene expression across all organisms - meaning that the same parts can be used to program E. coli, P. putida, C. necator, and K. nataicola. Most parts had a similar expression trend across hosts, although each organism had a different average gene expression level. The variability is enough that to achieve the same MEFL in a different organism, a lookup table is required to translate a design from one host to another. To identify truly divergent parts, we applied linear regression to a combinatorial set of promoters and ribosome binding sites, finding that the promoter J23100 behaves very differently in K. nataicola than in the other hosts. Thus, it is now possible to evaluate any CIDAR compatible part in three other hosts of interest, and the diversity of these hosts implies that the collection will also be compatible with many other Proteobacteria (Pseudomonadota). Furthermore, this work defines an approach to generalize modular synthetic biology parts sets beyond a single host, making it possible to create a small number of parts sets that can span the tree of life. This will accelerate current efforts to engineer diverse species for environmental, biotechnological, and health applications.",

    "abstract": "Type I interferon (IFN) upregulates proteins that inhibit HIV within infected cells. Prior studies have identified IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that impede lab-adapted HIV in cell lines, yet the ISG(s) that mediate IFN restriction in HIV target cells, primary CD4+ T cells, are unknown. Here, we interrogate ISG restriction of primary HIV in CD4+ T cells. We performed CRISPR-knockout screens using a custom library that specifically targets ISGs expressed in CD4+ T cells and validated top hits. Our investigation identified new HIV-restricting ISGs (HM13, IGFBP2, LAP3) and found that two previously studied factors (IFI16, UBE2L6) are IFN effectors in T cells. Inactivation of these five ISGs in combination further diminished IFNs protective effect against six diverse HIV strains. This work demonstrates that IFN restriction of HIV is multifaceted, resulting from several effectors functioning collectively, and establishes a primary cell ISG screening model to identify both single and combinations of HIV-restricting ISGs.",

    "abstract": "Gene regulatory effects in bulk-post mortem brain tissues are undetected at many non-coding brain trait-associated loci. We hypothesized that context-specific genetic variant function during stimulation of a developmental signaling pathway would explain additional regulatory mechanisms. We measured chromatin accessibility and gene expression following activation of the canonical Wnt pathway in primary human neural progenitors from 82 donors. TCF/LEF motifs, brain structure-, and neuropsychiatric disorder-associated variants were enriched within Wnt-responsive regulatory elements (REs). Genetically influenced REs were enriched in genomic regions under positive selection along the human lineage. Stimulation of the Wnt pathway increased the detection of genetically influenced REs/genes by 66.2%/52.7%, and led to the identification of 397 REs primed for effects on gene expression. Context-specific molecular quantitative trait loci increased brain-trait colocalizations by up to 70%, suggesting that genetic variant effects during early neurodevelopmental patterning lead to differences in adult brain and behavioral traits.",

    "abstract": "XPD helicase is a DNA unwinding enzyme involved in multiple cellular processes. As part of TFIIH, XPD opens a repair bubble in DNA for access by proteins in the nucleotide excision repair pathway. XPD uses the energy from ATP hydrolysis to translocate in the 5 to 3 direction on one strand of duplex DNA, displacing the opposite strand in the process. We used magnetic tweezers assays to measure the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) unwinding and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) translocation activities of human XPD by itself. In our experimental setup, hXPD exhibits low unwinding processivity of ~14 bp and slow overall unwinding rate of ~0.3 bp/s. Individual unwinding and translocation events were composed of fast and slow runs and pauses. Analysis of these events gave similar mean run sizes and rates for unwinding and translocation, suggesting that unwinding is a reflection of translocation. The analysis also revealed that hXPD spent similar time stalling and unwinding. hXPD translocated on ssDNA at a similar overall rate as that of unwinding, pointing to an active helicase. However, we observed modest effects of DNA sequence on stalling and unwinding initiation position. Considering the slow unwinding rate, high probability of base pair separation at the ssDNA/dsDNA fork, and the observed DNA sequence dependences, we propose that hXPD is most likely a partially active helicase. Our results provide detailed information on the basal activity of hXPD which enhances our mechanistic understanding of hXPD activity.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEHuman XPD helicase is a major component of the general transcription factor TFIIH. TFIIH is essential in both transcription and nucleotide excision repair. Mutations in hXPD are associated with cancers and autosomal recessive disorders. Here we directly measured the dsDNA unwinding and ssDNA translocation of human XPD helicase by itself. Our measurements provide detailed information on the basal activity of human XPD, which enhance our mechanistic understanding of the activity of XPD in the cell, provide a basis for better understanding of the clinical phenotypes, and aid in drug design targeting hXPD related diseases.",
