    "abstract": "BackgroundCardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) appearing in non-coding genomic regions in CVDs. The SNPs may alter gene expression by modifying transcription factor (TF) binding sites and lead to functional consequences in cardiovascular traits or diseases. To understand the underlying molecular mechanisms, it is crucial to identify which variations are involved and how they affect TF binding.\n\nMethodsThe SNEEP (SNP exploration and analysis using epigenomics data) pipeline was used to identify regulatory SNPs, which alter the binding behavior of TFs and link GWAS SNPs to their potential target genes for six CVDs. The human induced pluripotent stem cells derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), monoculture cardiac organoids (MCOs) and self-organized cardiac organoids (SCOs) were used in the study. Gene expression, cardiomyocyte size and cardiac contractility were assessed.\n\nResultsBy using our integrative computational pipeline, we identified 1905 regulatory SNPs in CVD GWAS data. These were associated with hundreds of genes, half of them non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), suggesting novel CVD genes. We experimentally tested 40 CVD-associated non-coding RNAs, among them RP11-98F14.11, RPL23AP92, IGBP1P1, and CTD-2383I20.1, which were upregulated in hiPSC-CMs, MCOs and SCOs under hypoxic conditions. Further experiments showed that IGBP1P1 depletion rescued expression of hypertrophic marker genes, reduced hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte size and improved hypoxia-reduced cardiac contractility in hiPSC-CMs and MCOs.\n\nConclusionsIGBP1P1 is a novel ncRNA with key regulatory functions in modulating cardiomyocyte size and cardiac function in our disease models. Our data suggest ncRNA IGBP1P1 as a potential therapeutic target to improve cardiac function in CVDs.",

    "abstract": "Extended acoustic interactions with a humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) were captured via human-initiated playbacks of the purported humpback \"throp\" social call and hydrophone recordings of the animals vocalized responses during August 2021 in Frederick Sound, Southeast Alaska. Multivariate statistical analyses performed after the event, that adapted the Wasserstein metric to spectrograms, strongly imply that the played back call was from the same animal, which had been recorded the previous day and initially selected for its clarity. This suggests these interactive playback studies may have formed a probe of time-delayed self-recognition. Fluke photographs taken that previous day and during the interactions revealed that the animal had been identified 38 years earlier, now known as the female humpback named Twain 14 years ago.\n\nThis exciting and to our knowledge unique series of interactive vocalization events, while hopeful, poses more questions than answers. Most basically, did the half-hour long series of acoustic exchanges constitute an interspecies conversation? We argue that analysis tools available to infer the implied causality of interaction--statistical dependency, multivariate information theory, and machine learning--leave the question open. That said, and perhaps more importantly, the extended interaction broaches questions whose answers bear directly on future interspecies communication and, more generally, the human appreciation of nonhuman intelligence. The reported human-humpback interactions will facilitate exploring these issues at new depths.",

    "abstract": "Zebrafish is a valuable model for neuroscience research, but the housing conditions to which it is daily exposed may be impairing its welfare status. The use of environmental enrichment and the refinement of methodology for cortisol measurement could reduce stress, improving its welfare and its suitability as an animal model used in stress research. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate (I) the influence of different housing conditions on zebrafish physiology and behavior and (II) skin mucus potential for cortisol measurement in adult zebrafish. For this, AB zebrafish were raised under barren or enriched (PVC pipes and gravel image) environmental conditions. After 6 months, the behavior was assessed by different behavioral paradigms (shoaling, white-black box test, and novel tank). The physiological response was also evaluated through cortisol levels (whole-body homogenates and skin mucus) and brain oxidative stress markers. Results revealed that enriched-housed fish had an increased nearest neighbors distance and reduced activity. However, no effect on body length or stress biomarkers was observed; whole-body and skin mucus cortisol levels had the same profile between groups. In conclusion, this study highlights the skin mucus potential as a matrix for cortisol quantification and how environmental enrichment could influence the data in future studies.\n\nSimple SummaryThe delivery of proper housing conditions may translate into good fish welfare. As zebrafish housing is usually poorly enriched, the fish could be unable to express some natural behaviors, leading to distress and/ or stress mechanisms dysregulation. This work focused on the examination of zebrafish welfare raised under different housing conditions (barren or environmentally enriched) and the testing of a low-invasive technique (skin mucus collection) to measure the main stress hormone (cortisol). The data was processed to assess body length, behavior, and physiological status. Results revealed that enrichment induced minor alterations on zebrafish behavior. Thus, the influence of housing conditions should be considered in future research, depending on the purpose of the study. Also, skin mucus appears to be a promising matrix to replace whole-body to measure cortisol in zebrafish, since its collection is nonlethal and showed similar results to the traditional method.",

    "abstract": "PurposeKnee cartilage experiences repetitive loading during physical activities, which is altered during the pathogenesis of diseases like osteoarthritis. Analyzing the biomechanics during motion provides a clear understanding of the dynamics of cartilage deformation, and may establish essential imaging biomarkers of early-stage disease. However, in vivo biomechanical analysis of cartilage during rapid motion is not well established.\n\nMethodsWe used spiral DENSE MRI on in vivo human tibiofemoral cartilage during cyclic varus loading (0.5 Hz) and employed compressed sensing on the k-space data. The applied compressive load was set for each participant at 0.5x body weight on the medial condyle. Relaxometry methods were measured on the cartilage before (T1{rho}, T2) and after (T1{rho}) varus load.\n\nResultsDisplacement and strain maps showed a gradual shift of displacement and strain in time. Compressive strain was observed in the medial condyle cartilage and shear strain was roughly half of the compressive strain. Male participants had more displacement in the loading direction compared to females, and T1{rho} values did not change after cyclic varus load. Compressed sensing reduced the scanning time up to 25-40% when comparing the displacement maps and substantially lowered the noise levels.\n\nConclusionThese results demonstrated the ease of which spiral DENSE MRI could be applied to clinical studies due to the shortened imaging time, while quantifying realistic cartilage deformations that occur through daily activities, and that could serve as biomarkers of early osteoarthritis.",

    "abstract": "How is curvature coded in the early human visual system? This question is the essence of basic shape recognition and may explain why humans are so successful in recognizing objects under difficult and varying environment conditions. We use the circle-polygon illusion (Khuu, 2002), to reveal coding mechanisms in the early visual system. The stimulus, constructed by Sakurais method (Sakurai, 2014), is a static dark outline circle augmented with a 2 Hz pulsed luminance gradient around the inner border. Both the radius and eccentricity of the stimulus were varied in a crossed design over 1-8 deg. Observers reported a circle or the polygon order and the strength of the percept. We test a lower level account that argues for curvature opponency between neurons against a higher level account that codes for whole shapes. This higher level account supports scale invariance, a property through which we recognize objects regardless of the objects rotation (or orientation) and its size on the retina. We show the following: (1) Scale invariance, a property of the higher level visual system feature through which we recognize objects regardless of the objects rotation (or orientation) and its size on the retina, is not obeyed during adaptation. The mean order of the perceived polygon increased with stimulus size and decreased with eccentricity. It did not remain constant for a stimulus size. This demonstrates that the curvature coding occurs in the early visual system. (2) Linear regression analysis reveals that the cortical size of the stimulus is a better predictor of perceived polygon order. We computed the circumference of each stimulus in both retinal and cortical coordinates, taking cortical magnification into account.",

    "abstract": "Brain connectivity analysis begins with the selection of a parcellation scheme that will define brain regions as nodes of a network whose connections will be studied. Brain connectivity has already been used in predictive modelling of cognition, but it remains unclear if the resolution of the parcellation used can systematically impact the predictive model performance. In this work, structural, functional and combined connectivity were each defined with 5 different parcellation schemes. The resolution and modality of the parcellation schemes were varied. Each connectivity defined with each parcellation was used to predict individual differences in age, education, sex, Executive Function, Self-regulation, Language, Encoding and Sequence Processing. It was found that low-resolution functional parcellation consistently performed above chance at producing generalisable models of both demographics and cognition. However, no single parcellation scheme proved superior at predictive modelling across all cognitive domains and demographics. In addition, although parcellation schemes impacted the global organisation of each connectivity type, this difference could not account for the out-of-sample prediction performance of the models. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that while high-resolution parcellations may be beneficial for modelling specific individual differences, partial voluming of signals produced by higher resolution of parcellation likely disrupts model generalisability.",

    "abstract": "The locus coeruleus (LC) is the primary source of norepinephrine (NE) in the brain, and the LC-NE system is involved in regulating arousal and sleep. It plays key roles in the transition between sleep and wakefulness, and between slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement sleep (REMS). However, it is not clear whether the LC activity during the day predicts sleep quality and sleep properties during the night, and how this varies as a function of age. Here, we used 7 Tesla functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (7T fMRI), sleep electroencephalography (EEG) and a sleep questionnaire to test whether the LC activity during wakefulness was associated with sleep quality in 52 healthy younger (N=33; ~22y; 28 women) and older (N=19; ~61y; 14 women) individuals. We find that, in older, but not in younger participants, higher LC activity, as probed during an auditory mismatch negativity task, is associated with worse subjective sleep quality and with lower power over the EEG theta band during REMS (4-8Hz), which are two sleep parameters significantly correlated in our sample of older individuals. The results remain robust even when accounting for the age-related changes in the integrity of the LC. These findings suggest that the activity of the LC may contribute to the perception of the sleep quality and to an essential oscillatory mode of REMS, and that the LC may be an important target in the treatment of sleep disorders and age-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) enables the study of protein complexes, cytoskeletal elements, and organelles in three dimensions without the use of chemical fixation. Most cryo-EM studies focus on vitreously frozen individual cells separated from their native tissue contexts. This reliance on imaging of single cells is primarily due to technical challenges associated with preparing fresh tissue sections at a thinness sufficient for visualization via cryo-EM. Highly heterogenous and specialized tissues, such as brain, are especially affected by this limitation as the cellular, subcellular, and synaptic milieus can significantly vary across neuroanatomical locations. To address this limitation, we established new instrumentation and a workflow that consists of: 1) high-pressure freezing of fresh brain tissue; 2) tissue trimming followed by cryo-focused ion beam milling via the H-bar approach to generate ultrathin lamellae; and 3) cryo-EM imaging. Here, we apply this workflow to visualize the fine ultrastructural details of organelles, as well as cytoskeletal and synaptic elements that comprise the cortical neuropil within fresh, unfixed mouse brain tissue. Moreover, we present initial studies that apply principles of the above workflow to the analysis of postmortem human brain tissue. Overall, our work integrates the strengths of cryo-electron microscopy and tissue-based approaches to produce a generalizable workflow capable of visualizing subcellular structures within complex tissue environments.",

    "abstract": "Pavlovian conditioning is thought to involve the formation of learned associations between stimuli and values, and between stimuli and specific features of outcomes. Here we leveraged human single neuron recordings in ventromedial prefrontal, dorsomedial frontal, hippocampus and amygdala neurons while patients performed a sequential Pavlovian conditioning task containing both stimulus-value and stimulus-stimulus associations. Neurons in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex encoded predictive value along with the amygdala, but also encoded predictions about the identity of stimuli that would subsequently be presented, suggesting a role for neurons in this region in encoding predictive information beyond value. Unsigned error signals were found in dorsomedial prefrontal areas and hippocampus, potentially supporting learning of non-value related outcome features. Our findings implicate distinct human prefrontal and medial temporal neuronal populations in mediating predictive associations which could partially support model-based mechanisms during Pavlovian conditioning.\n\nSignificance statementPavlovian conditioning is a fundamental form of learning, allowing organisms to associate stimuli and outcomes. Recent Pavlovian work suggests that phenomena such as devaluation sensitivity and sensory preconditioning can be explained by a model-based learning framework. How human neurons perform model-based learning during Pavlovian conditioning is still an open question. We recorded single neurons from epilepsy patients during a two-step Pavlovian conditioning task and found that ventromedial prefrontal neurons encoded expected rewards along with amygdala neurons, but also predicted the identity of upcoming stimuli as required for model-based cognition. Additionally, medial frontal neurons were found to encode error signals that could be used for stimulus-outcome learning. This is the first study mapping model-based computations during Pavlovian conditioning in human neurons.",

    "abstract": "For coherent visual experience to emerge, the brain needs to spatially integrate the complex and dynamic information it receives from the environment. To meet this challenge, the visual system uses contextual information from one part of the visual field to create feedback signals that guide analysis in other parts of the visual field. Here, we set out to characterize the nature of this feedback across brain rhythms and cortical regions. In EEG and fMRI experiments, we experimentally recreated the spatially distributed nature of visual inputs by presenting natural videos at different visual field locations. Critically, we manipulated the spatiotemporal congruency of the videos, so that they did or did not demand integration into a coherent percept. Decoding stimulus information from frequency-specific EEG patterns revealed a shift from representations in feedforward-related gamma activity for spatiotemporally inconsistent videos to representations in feedback-related alpha activity for spatiotemporally consistent videos. Our fMRI data suggest high-level scene-selective areas as the putative source of this feedback. Combining the EEG data with spatially resolved fMRI recordings, we demonstrate that alpha-frequency feedback is directly associated with representations in early visual cortex. Together this demonstrates how the human brain orchestrates coherent visual experience across space: it uses feedback to integrate information from high-level to early visual cortex through a dedicated rhythmic code in the alpha frequency range.",

To do so, we scan parameters in the dihedral angle potential energy terms describing the rotation of the methyl groups in proteins, and compare NMR relaxation rates calculated from molecular dynamics simulations with the modified force fields to deuterium relaxation measurements of T4 lysozyme. We find that a small modification of C{gamma} methyl groups improves the agreement with experiments both for the protein used to optimize the force field, and when validating using simulations of CI2 and ubiquitin. We also show that these improvements enable a more effective a posteriori reweighting of the MD trajectories. The resulting force field thus enables more direct comparison between simulations and side-chain NMR relaxation data, and makes it possible to construct ensembles that better represent the dynamics of proteins in solution.",
