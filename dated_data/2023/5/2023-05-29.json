    "abstract": "Brain reorganization after hemispherectomy (i.e. after the removal of a whole hemisphere) is perhaps the most remarkable example of large-scale brain plasticity. Most often patients survive and recover their skills. Functional traits located in the lost side (e.g. language areas) can sometimes be completely reassembled in the remaining hemisphere, which seamlessly takes on the additional processing burden. This demands drastic rearrangements, perhaps involving the readaptation of functionally and structurally diverse neural structures. We lack mathematical models of how this happens. We introduce a very simple model, based on self-organized maps, that provides a rationale to the clinical aftermath of the intervention, putative windows for recovery, and the origins and nature of observed thresholds for irreversible function loss. The implications for brain symmetry and potential scenarios in simulated pathologies, including efficient suggested treatments, are outlined.",

    "abstract": "Transcription start site (TSS) selection is a key step in gene expression and occurs at many promoter positions over a wide range of efficiencies. Here, we develop a massively parallel reporter assay to quantitatively dissect contributions of promoter sequence, NTP substrate levels, and RNA polymerase II (Pol II) activity to TSS selection by \"promoter scanning\" in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Pol II MAssively Systematic Transcript End Readout, \"Pol II MASTER\"). Using Pol II MASTER, we measure the efficiency of Pol II initiation at 1,000,000 individual TSS sequences in a defined promoter context. Pol II MASTER confirms proposed critical qualities of S. cerevisiae TSS -8, -1, and +1 positions quantitatively in a controlled promoter context. Pol II MASTER extends quantitative analysis to surrounding sequences and determines that they tune initiation over a wide range of efficiencies. These results enabled the development of a predictive model for initiation efficiency based on sequence. We show that genetic perturbation of Pol II catalytic activity alters initiation efficiency mostly independently of TSS sequence, but selectively modulates preference for initiating nucleotide. Intriguingly, we find that Pol II initiation efficiency is directly sensitive to GTP levels at the first five transcript positions and to CTP and UTP levels at the second position genome wide. These results suggest individual NTP levels can have transcript-specific effects on initiation, representing a cryptic layer of potential regulation at the level of Pol II biochemical properties. The results establish Pol II MASTER as a method for quantitative dissection of transcription initiation in eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "Sensory neurons enable an organism to perceive external stimuli, which is essential for survival. The sensory capacity of a neuron depends on the elaboration of its dendritic arbor and the delivery of sensory ion channels to the dendritic membrane. However, it is not well understood how ion channels are trafficked to sensory dendrites and whether their delivery is coordinated with dendrite growth. We investigated the trafficking of the DEG/ENaC/ASIC ion channel Pickpocket (Ppk) in peripheral sensory neurons in fruit fly larvae. We used CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering to tag endogenous Ppk1 and visualize it live, including monitoring Ppk1 membrane localization via a novel secreted split-GFP approach. Strikingly, Ppk1 is present throughout the membrane of actively growing dendrites, and Ppk1 density scales in proportion to the dendritic membrane, even when dynein-mediated transport to dendrites is disrupted. Our data suggest that Ppk1 is integral to the membrane of growing dendrites and implicate the recycling endosome GTPase Rab11 in the forward trafficking of Ppk1 to dendrites. Together, our results suggest that Ppk channel transport is coordinated with dendrite morphogenesis, thus ensuring proper ion channel levels and distribution in sensory dendrites.\n\nAuthor SummaryPeripheral sensory neurons are essential for an organism to interact with its environment. Neurons are composed of signal-receiving dendrites and a signal-sending axon. Ion channels distributed throughout sensory dendrites transduce external stimuli into chemical signals, however the mechanisms that localize ion channels to sensory dendrites are not well understood. Both the composition of ion channels in the dendrites and the structure of a sensory neurons dendritic arbor are important for how it functions to sense external stimuli. Using live imaging and genomic engineering, we have discovered that the localization of a sensory ion channel, Pickpocket, in fruit fly sensory neurons is coordinated with growth of the dendritic arbor and that Pickpocket levels scale in proportion to dendrite length, even when transport to dendrites is disrupted. We also developed a novel genetically encoded approach to visualize the membrane expression of proteins in a living organism utilizing the split-GFP system. We found that both the secretory and endosomal networks mediate the forward trafficking of Pickpocket during neuronal morphogenesis, thus coordinating membrane growth with ion channel delivery. Our findings reveal that actively growing sensory dendrites are equipped with the ion channels needed for sensing external stimuli.",

In recent years, the CTC-RNN model has become the leading basecalling model and has replaced prior hidden Markov models (HMMs) based on pre-segmentation of the ion current measurements. However, CTC-RNN relies on the neural network to make basecalling decisions while prior knowledge of the biological and physical processes is not involved. We believe that there are undiscovered potentials in using this prior knowledge that can benefit the basecalling performances and that HMMs can indeed be used to leverage this information if combined with an RNN in an end-to-end algorithm.\n\nResultsWe present the basecaller named Lokatt: explicit duration Markov model and residual-LSTM network. It is a novel basecaller structure based on an Explicit Duration HMM (EDHMM), designed to model the nanopore sequencing processes. Trained on a new library created with free-methylation Ecoli genome with MinION R9.4.1 chemistry, the Lokatt basecaller achieves basecalling performances with a median single read identity score of 92%, a genome coverage ratio of 99.750%, on par with existing state-of-the-art.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/chunxxc/lokatt; Data is held on Zenodo, DOI:10.5281/zenodo.7970716.\n\nContactchunx@kth.se;chunxxc@gmail.com\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "O_LIAmphibians are among the most threatened taxa as they are highly sensitive to habitat degradation and fragmentation. They are considered as model species to evaluate habitats quality in agricultural landscapes. In France, all amphibian species have a protected status requiring recovery plans for their conservation. Conservation networks combining protected areas and green infrastructure can help the maintenance of their habitats while favouring their movement in fragmented landscapes such as farmlands. Yet, assessing the effectiveness of conservation networks is challenging.\nC_LIO_LIHere, we compared the ecological requirements of amphibian species with existing conservation network coverage in a human-dominated region of western France. First, we mapped suitable habitat distributions for nine species of amphibian with varying ecological requirements and mobility. Second, we used stacking species distribution modelling (SSDM) to produce multi-species habitat suitability maps. Then, to identify spatial continuity in suitable habitats at the regional scale, we defined species and multi-species core habitats to perform a connectivity analysis using Circuitscape theory. Finally, we compared different suitability maps with existing conservation networks to assess conservation coverage and efficiency.\nC_LIO_LIWe highlighted a mismatch between the most suitable amphibian habitats at the regional scale and the conservation network, both for common species and for species of high conservation concern. We also found two bottlenecks between areas of suitable habitat which might be crucial for population movements induced by global change, especially for species associated with hedgerow mosaic landscapes. These bottlenecks were not covered by any form of protection and are located in an intensive farmland context.\nC_LIO_LISynthesis and applications - We advocate the need to better integrate agricultural landscape mosaics into species conservation planning as well as to protect and promote agroecological practices suitable for biodiversity, including mixed and extensive livestock farming. We also emphasize the importance of interacting landscape elements of green infrastructure for amphibian conservation and the need for these to be effectively considered in land-use planning policies.\nC_LI\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=185 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/500425v4_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (62K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b6446forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@146e7c7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ad210org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d545a0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG PCI recommendation : https://ecology.peercommunityin.org/articles/rec?id=504",

    "abstract": "Elementary flux modes (EFMs) are minimal, steady state pathways characterizing a flux network. Fundamentally, all steady state fluxes in a network are decomposable into a linear combination of EFMs. While there is typically no unique set of EFM weights that reconstructs these fluxes, several optimization-based methods have been proposed to constrain the solution space by enforcing some notion of parsimony. However, it has long been recognized that optimization-based approaches may fail to uniquely identify EFM weights and return different feasible solutions across objective functions and solvers. Here we show that, for flux networks only involving single molecule transformations, these problems can be avoided by imposing a Markovian constraint on EFM weights. Our Markovian constraint guarantees a unique solution to the flux decomposition problem, and that solution is arguably more biophysically plausible than other solutions. We describe an algorithm for computing Markovian EFM weights via steady state analysis of a certain discrete-time Markov chain, based on the flux network, which we call the cycle-history Markov chain. We demonstrate our method with a differential analysis of EFM activity in a lipid metabolic network comparing healthy and Alzheimers disease patients. Our method is the first to uniquely decompose steady state fluxes into EFM weights for any unimolecular metabolic network.",

    "abstract": "Plant viruses account for enormous agricultural losses worldwide, and the most effective way to combat them is to identify genetic material conferring plant resistance to these pathogens. Aiming to identify genetic associations with responses to infection, we screened a large panel of Arabidopsis thaliana natural inbred lines for four disease-related traits caused by infection by A. thaliana-naive and -adapted isolates of the natural pathogen turnip mosaic virus (TuMV). We detected a strong, replicable association in a 1.5 Mb region on chromosome 2 with a 10-fold increase in relative risk of systemic necrosis. The region contains several plausible causal genes as well as abundant structural variation, including an insertion of a Copia transposon into a Toll/interleukin receptor (TIR-NBS-LRR) coding for a gene involved in defense, that could be either a driver or a consequence of the disease-resistance locus. When inoculated with TuMV, loss-of-function mutant plants of this gene exhibited different symptoms than wild-type plants, being the magnitude and sign of the difference dependent on the degree of adaptation of the viral isolate to A. thaliana. This increase in symptoms severity was specific for infections with the adapted isolate. Necrosis-associated alleles are found worldwide, and their distribution is consistent with a trade-off between resistance during viral outbreaks and a cost of resistance otherwise, leading to negative frequency-dependent selection.",

Resting EEG was recorded from 86 adults (50-80 years of age). Participants additionally completed the Addenbrookes Cognitive Examination (ACE) III and had blood drawn to assess APOE-{varepsilon}4 carriage status and cardiometabolic burden. EEG power spectra were decomposed into sources of periodic and aperiodic activity to derive measures of aperiodic component slope and alpha (7-14 Hz) and beta (15-30 Hz) peak power and peak frequency. Alpha and beta peak power measures were corrected for aperiodic activity. The aperiodic component slope was correlated with ACE-III scores but not age. Alpha peak frequency decreased with age. Individuals with higher cardiometabolic burden had lower alpha peak frequencies and lower beta peak power. APOE-{varepsilon}4 carriers had lower beta peak frequencies. Our findings suggest that the slope of the aperiodic component of resting EEG power spectra is more closely associated with measures of cognitive performance rather than chronological age in older adults.",

To regress the chronological age from cytokine data, we first use a baseline Elastic Net model, gradient-boosted decision trees models, and several deep neural network architectures. For the full dataset of 46 immunological parameters, DANet, SAINT, FT-Transformer and TabNet models showed the best results for the test dataset. Dimensionality reduction of these models with SHAP values revealed the 10 most age-associated immunological parameters, taken to construct the SImAge small immunological clock. The best result of the SImAge model shown by the FT-Transformer deep neural network model has mean absolute error of 6.94 years and Pearson{rho} = 0.939 on the independent test dataset. Explainable artificial intelligence methods allow for explaining the model solution for each individual participant.\n\nConclusionsWe developed an approach to construct a model of immunological age based on just 10 immunological parameters, coined SImAge, for which the FT-Transformer deep neural network model had proved to be the best choice. The model shows competitive results compared to the published studies on immunological profiles, and takes a smaller number of features as an input. Neural network architectures outperformed gradient-boosted decision trees, and can be recommended in the further analysis of immunological profiles.",

    "abstract": "Aging is often associated with a decline in cognitive function. A reduction in the number of somatostatin-positive (SOM+) interneurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) has been described in cognitively impaired but not in unimpaired aged rodents. However, it remains unclear whether the reduction in SOM+ interneurons in the DG hilus is causal for age-related cognitive dysfunction. We hypothesized that hilar SOM+ interneurons play an essential role in maintaining cognitive function and that a reduction in the number of hilar SOM+ interneurons might be sufficient to induce cognitive dysfunction. Hilar SOM+ interneurons were ablated by expressing a diphtheria toxin transgene specifically in these interneurons, which resulted in a reduction in the number of SOM+/GAD-67+ neurons and dendritic spine density in the DG. C-fos and Iba-1 immunostainings were increased in DG and CA3 but not in CA1. Behavioral testing revealed a reduced recognition index in the novel object recognition test, a reduction in the percentage of correct alternations in the Y maze tests, and increased latencies and path lengths in the learning and the reversal learning phase of the Morris water maze. Our results show that partial genetic ablation of SOM+ hilar interneurons is sufficient to increase activity in DG and CA3, as has been described to occur with aging and to induce an impairment of learning and memory functions. Thus, partial ablation of hilar SOM+ interneurons may be a significant contributing factor to age-related cognitive dysfunction.

    "abstract": "Recent findings in animals have challenged the traditional view of the cerebellum solely as the site of motor control, suggesting that the cerebellum may also be important for learning to predict reward from trial-and-error feedback. Yet, evidence for the role of the cerebellum in reward learning in humans is lacking. Moreover, open questions remain about which specific aspects of reward learning the cerebellum may contribute to. Here we address this gap through an investigation of multiple forms of reward learning in individuals with cerebellum dysfunction, represented by cerebellar ataxia cases. Nineteen participants with cerebellar ataxia and 57 age- and sex-matched healthy controls completed two separate tasks that required learning about reward contingencies from trial-and-error. To probe the selectivity of reward learning processes, the tasks differed in their underlying structure: while one task measured incremental reward learning ability alone, the other allowed participants to use an alternative learning strategy based on episodic memory alongside incremental reward learning. We found that individuals with cerebellar ataxia were profoundly impaired at reward learning from trial-and-error feedback on both tasks, but retained the ability to learn to predict reward based on episodic memory. These findings provide evidence from humans for a specific and necessary role for the cerebellum in incremental learning of reward associations based on reinforcement. More broadly, the findings suggest that alongside its role in motor learning, the cerebellum likely operates in concert with the basal ganglia to support reinforcement learning from reward.",

    "abstract": "Nanopore sequencing is a widely-used high-throughput genome sequencing technology that can se-quence long fragments of a genome. Nanopore sequencing generates noisy electrical signals that need to be converted into a standard string of DNA nucleotide bases using a computational step called basecalling. The performance of basecalling has critical implications for all later steps in genome analysis. Many researchers adopt complex deep learning-based models from the speech recognition domain to perform basecalling without considering the compute demands of such models, which leads to slow, inefficient, and memory-hungry basecallers. Therefore, there is a need to reduce the computation and memory cost of basecalling while maintaining accuracy. However, developing a very fast basecaller that can provide high accuracy requires a deep understanding of genome sequencing, machine learning, and hardware design. Our goal is to develop a comprehensive framework for creating deep learning-based basecallers that provide high efficiency and performance. We introduce RUBICON, a framework to develop hardware-optimized basecallers. RUBICON consists of two novel machine-learning techniques that are specifically designed for basecalling. First, we introduce the first quantization-aware basecalling neural architecture search (QABAS) framework to specialize the basecalling neural network architecture for a given hardware acceleration platform while jointly exploring and finding the best bit-width precision for each neural network layer. Second, we develop SkipClip, the first technique to remove the skip connections present in modern basecallers to greatly reduce resource and storage requirements without any loss in basecalling accuracy. We demonstrate the benefits of RUBICON by developing RUBICALL, the first hardware-optimized basecaller that performs fast and accurate basecalling. Our experimental results on state-of-the-art computing systems show that RUBICALL is a fast, memory-efficient, and hardware-friendly basecaller. Compared to the fastest state-of-the-art basecaller, RUBICALL provides a 3.96x speedup with 2.97% higher accuracy. Compared to an expert-designed basecaller, RUBICALL provides a 141.15x speedup without losing accuracy while also achieving a 6.88x and 2.94x reduction in neural network model size and the number of parameters, respectively. We show that RUBICON helps researchers develop hardware-optimized basecallers that are superior to expert-designed models and can inspire independent future ideas.",

    "abstract": "The free-living amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii is an ecologically, clinically, and evolutionarily important microorganism. A. castellanii amoebae are directly pathogenic to humans and serve as reservoirs for bacterial pathogens (e.g., Legionella pneumophila) but also regulate the proliferation of other microorganisms in the soil. Despite their importance, no reliable genetic system has been developed, hampering the use of A. castellanii and related species as model organisms. Transfecting A. castellanii with plasmids is possible with commercial kits, but it is expensive, inefficient, and vulnerable to product discontinuation. In this contribution, we present a method for efficient transfection of A. castellanii with readily available and inexpensive polyethylenimines. We systematically explore the methods parameters, obtaining up to 100-fold higher efficiency than currently used protocols. The method presented here provides a robust step towards a complete genetic toolbox for A. castellanii, hence expanding its use as a model organism.",

    "abstract": "Robust characterization of cellular phenotypes from single-cell gene expression data is of paramount importance in studying complex biological systems and diseases. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA- seq), coupled with robust computational analysis, facilitates characterization of phenotypic heterogeneity in tumors. Current scRNA-seq analysis pipelines are capable of accurately identifying a myriad of malignant and non-malignant cell subtypes from single-cell profiling of tumor microenvironments. Unfortunately, given the extent of phenotypic heterogeneity, it is not straightforward to assess the risk associated with individual malignant cell subpopulations in a tumor, primarily due to the complexity of the cancer phenotype space and the lack of clinical annotations associated with tumor scRNA-seq studies, involving prospectively collected tissue samples. Effective risk-stratification of individual malignant subclones holds promise for formulating tailored therapeutic interventions. To this end, we present SCellBOW, a computational approach that facilitates risk-stratification by leveraging scRNA-seq profiles and language modeling techniques. We compared SCellBOW with existing best practice methods for its ability to precisely represent phenotypically divergent cell types across multiple scRNA-seq datasets, including our in-house generated human splenocyte and matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) dataset. SCellBOW offers a remarkable feature for executing algebraic operations such as + and - on single-cells in the latent space while preserving the biological meanings. This feature catalyzes the simulation of the residual phenotype of tumors, following positive and negative selection of specific malignant cell subtypes in a tumor. As a proof of concept, we tested and validated phenotype algebra across three independent cancer types - glioblastoma multiforme, breast cancer and metastatic prostate cancer. In particular, we demonstrate how the negative selection of specific clones may lead to variable prognosis. From the metastatic prostate cancer scRNA-seq data, SCellBOW identifies a hitherto unknown and pervasive AR-/NElow (androgen receptor negative, neuroendocrine-low) malignant cell subpopulation with a conspicuously high predictive risk score. We could trace this back in a large-scale spatial omics atlas of 141 well-characterized metastatic prostate cancer samples at the spot resolution.",

    "abstract": "Concerns about widespread human-induced declines in insect populations are mounting, yet little is known about how land-use change modifies the dynamics of insect communities, particularly in understudied biomes. Here, we examine how the seasonal patterns of ant activity--key drivers of terrestrial ecosystem functioning--vary with human-induced land cover change on a subtropical island landscape. Using trap captures sampled biweekly from a biodiversity monitoring network covering Okinawa Island, Japan, we processed 1.2 million individuals and reconstructed activity patterns within and across habitat types. Forest communities exhibited greater variability than those in more developed areas. Using time-series decomposition to deconstruct this pattern, we found that ant communities at sites with greater human development exhibited diminished seasonality, reduced synchrony, and higher stochasticity compared to those at sites with greater forest cover. Our results cannot be explained by variation in either regional or in situ temperature patterns, or by differences in species richness or composition among sites. We conclude that the breakdown of natural seasonal patterns of functionally key insect communities may comprise an important and underappreciated consequence of global environmental change that must be better understood across Earths biomes.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key cellular transformation for many physiological and pathological processes ranging from cancer over wound healing to embryogenesis. Changes in cell migration, cell morphology and cellular contractility were identified as hallmarks of EMT. These cellular properties are known to be tightly regulated by the actin cytoskeleton. EMT-induced changes of actin-cytoskeletal regulation were demonstrated by previous reports of cell-cycle-dependent changes of actin cortex mechanics in conjunction with characteristic modifications of cortex-associated f-actin and myosin. However, at the current state, the changes of upstream actomyosin signalling that lead to corresponding mechanical and compositional changes of the cortex are not well understood. In this work, we show in breast epithelial cancer cells MCF-7 that EMT results in characteristic changes of the cortical signalling of Rho-GTPases Rac1, RhoA and RhoC and downstream actin regulators cofilin, mDia1 and Arp2/3. In the light of our findings, we propose that cell-cycle-dependent EMT-induced changes in cortical mechanics rely on two hitherto unappreciated signalling paths - i) a cell-cycle-dependent interaction between Rac1 and RhoC and ii) an inhibitory effect of Arp2/3 activity on cortical association of myosin II.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation in ulcerative colitis is typically restricted to the mucosal layer of distal gut. Disrupted mucus barrier coupled with microbial dysbiosis has been reported to occur prior to the onset of inflammation. Here, we show the involvement of vesicular trafficking protein Rab7 in regulating the colonic mucus system. We identified a lowered Rab7 expression in goblet cells of colon during human and murine colitis. In vivo Rab7 knocked down mice (Rab7KD) displayed a compromised mucus layer, increased microbial permeability and depleted gut microbiota with enhanced susceptibility to dextran sodium-sulfate induced colitis. These abnormalities emerged owing to altered mucus composition, as revealed by mucus proteomics, with increased expression of mucin protease Chloride channel accessory 1 (CLCA1). Mechanistically, Rab7 maintained optimal CLCA1 levels by controlling its lysosomal degradation, a process that was dysregulated during colitis. Overall, our work establishes a role for Rab7 dependent control of CLCA1 secretion required for maintaining mucosal homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "How rapidly can the brain transform vision into action? Work in humans has established that the transformation for visually-guided reaching can be remarkably rapid, with the first phase of upper limb muscle recruitment, the express visuomotor response, beginning within less than 100 ms of visual target presentation. Such short-latency responses limit the opportunities for extensive cortical processing, leading to the hypothesis that they are generated via the subcortical tectoreticulospinal pathway. Here, we examine if non-human primates (NHPs) exhibit express visuomotor responses. Two male macaques made visually-guided reaches in a behavioral paradigm known to elicit express visuomotor responses in humans, while we acquired intramuscular recordings from the deltoid muscle. Across several variants of this paradigm, express visuomotor responses began within 65 ms (range 48-91 ms) of target presentation. Although the timing of the express visuomotor response did not co-vary with reaction time, larger express visuomotor responses tended to precede shorter latency reaches. Finally, the magnitude of the express visuomotor response was muted on trials where NHPs withheld a reach to one stimulus in order to move to a stimulus appearing 34 ms later in the opposite direction. Overall, the response properties and contextual control of express visuomotor responses in NHPs resemble those in humans. Our results establish a new benchmark for visuomotor transformations underlying visually-guided reaches, setting the stage for experiments that can directly compare the role of cortical and subcortical areas in reaching when time is of the essence.\n\nSignificance statementExpress visuomotor responses in upper limb muscles are brief periods of recruitment preceding visually-guided reaches. Such responses begin [~]90 ms after visual target presentation in humans, and potentially arise from signaling along the tecto-reticulo-spinal pathway. Here, we show that express visuomotor responses in macaques upper limb muscles resemble those in humans, excepting that they evolve [~]65 ms after target onset, consistent with shorter responses latencies in macaques versus humans. Our results clock the completion of the visuomotor transformation for rapid reaching, and set the stage for experiments to directly test the underlying substrates.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the neural mechanisms that regulate the stress response is critical to know how animals adapt to a changing world and is one of the key factors to be considered for improving animal welfare. Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) is crucial for regulating physiological and endocrine responses, triggering the activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamo - pituitary - adrenal axis (HPA) during stress. In mammals, several telencephalic areas, such as the amygdala and the hippocampus, regulate the autonomic system and the HPA responses. These centers include subpopulations of CRF containing neurons that, by way of CRF receptors, play modulatory roles in the emotional and cognitive aspects of stress. CRF binding protein also plays a role, buffering extracellular CRF and regulating its availability. CRF role in activation of the HPA is evolutionary conserved in vertebrates, highlighting the relevance of this system to help animals cope with adversity. However, knowledge on CRF systems in the avian telencephalon is very limited, and no information exists on detailed expression of CRF receptors and binding protein. Knowing that the stress response changes with age, with important variations during the first week posthatching, the aim of this study was to analyze mRNA expression of CRF, CRF receptors 1 and 2, and CRF binding protein in chicken telencephalon throughout embryonic and early posthatching development, using in situ hybridization. Our results demonstrate an early expression of CRF and its receptors in pallial areas regulating sensory processing, sensorimotor integration and cognition, and a late expression in subpallial areas regulating the stress response. However, CRF buffering system develops earlier in the subpallium than in the pallium. These results help to understand the mechanisms underlying the negative effects of noise and light during prehatching stages in chicken, and suggest that stress regulation becomes more sophisticated with age.",

    "abstract": "The parabrachial nuclear complex (PBN) is a nexus for aversion, and for the sensory and affective components of pain perception. We have previously shown that, during chronic pain, PBN neurons in anesthetized rodents have amplified activity. We report a method to record from PBN neurons of behaving, head-restrained mice, while applying reproducible noxious stimuli. We find that both spontaneous and evoked activity are higher in awake animals, compared to urethane anesthetized mice. Fiber photometry of calcium responses from CGRP-expressing PBN neurons demonstrates that these neurons respond to nociceptive stimuli. In both males and females with neuropathic or inflammatory pain, responses of PBN neurons remain amplified for at least 5 weeks, in parallel with increased pain metrics. We also show that PBN neurons can be rapidly conditioned to respond to innocuous stimuli, after pairing with nociceptive stimuli. Finally, we demonstrate that changes in PBN neuronal activity are correlated with changes in arousal, measured as changes in pupil diameter.\n\nSignificance StatementThe parabrachial complex is a nexus of aversion, including pain. We report a method to record from parabrachial nucleus neurons of behaving mice, while applying reproducible noxious stimuli. This allowed, for the first time, tracking the activity of these neurons over time in animals with neuropathic or inflammatory pain. It also allowed us to show that the activity of these neurons correlates with arousal states, and that these neurons can be conditioned to respond to innocuous stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Neurons establish specific synapses based on the adhesive properties of cell-surface proteins, while also retaining the ability to form synapses in a relatively non-selective manner. However, the comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanism reconciling these opposing characteristics remains incomplete. Here, we have identified Side-IV/Beat-IIb, members of the Drosophila immunoglobulin superfamily, as a novel combination of cell-surface recognition molecules inducing synapse formation. The Side-IV/Beat-IIb combination transduces bifurcated signaling with Side-IVs co-receptor, Kirre, and a synaptic scaffold protein, Dsyd-1. Genetic experiments and subcellular protein localization analyses showed the newly characterized Side-IV/Beat-IIb/Kirre/Dsyd-1 complex to have two essential functions. First, it narrows neuronal binding specificity through Side-IV/Beat-IIb extracellular interactions. Second, it recruits synapse formation factors, Kirre and Dsyd-1, to restrict synaptic loci and inhibit miswiring. This dual function explains how the combinations of cell-surface molecules enable the ranking of preferred interactions among neuronal pairs to achieve synaptic specificity in complex circuits in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Social behaviours can allow individuals to flexibly respond to environmental change, potentially buffering adverse effects. However, individuals may respond differently to the same environmental stimulus, complicating predictions for population-level response to environmental change. Here we show that bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) alter their social behaviour at yearly and monthly scales in response to a proxy for food availability (salmon abundance) but do not respond to variation in a proxy for climate (the North Atlantic Oscillation index). There was also individual variation in plasticity for gregariousness and connectedness to distant parts of the social network, although these traits showed limited repeatability. In contrast, individuals showed consistent differences in clustering with their immediate social environment at the yearly scale but no individual variation in plasticity for this trait at either time scale. These results indicate that social behaviour in free-ranging cetaceans can be highly resource dependent with individuals increasing their connectedness over short timescales but possibly reducing their wider range of connection at longer timescales. Some social traits showed more individual variation in plasticity or mean behaviour than others, highlighting how predictions for the responses of populations to environmental variation must consider the type of individual variation present in the population.",

    "abstract": "Trans-chromosomal interactions resulting in changes in DNA methylation during hybridization have been observed in several plant species. However, very little is known about the causes or consequences of these interactions. Here, we compared DNA methylomes of F1 hybrids that are mutant for a small RNA biogenesis gene, Mop1 (mediator of paramutation1) with that of their parents, wild type siblings, and backcrossed progeny in maize. Our data show that hybridization triggers global changes in both trans-chromosomal methylation (TCM) and trans-chromosomal demethylation (TCdM), most of which involved changes in CHH methylation. In more than 60% of these TCM differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in which small RNAs are available, no significant changes in the quantity of small RNAs were observed. Methylation at the CHH TCM DMRs was largely lost in the mop1 mutant, although the effects of this mutant varied depending on the location of the CHH DMRs. Interestingly, an increase in CHH at TCM DMRs was associated with enhanced expression of a subset of highly expressed genes and suppressed expression of a small number of lowly expressed genes. Examination of the methylation levels in backcrossed plants demonstrates that TCM and TCdM can be maintained in the subsequent generation, but that TCdM is more stable than TCM. Surprisingly, although increased CHH methylation in F1 plants did require Mop1, initiation of the changes in the epigenetic state of TCM DMRs did not require a functional copy of this gene, suggesting that initiation of these changes is not dependent on RNA-directed DNA methylation.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in human TET proteins have been found in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders. Here we report a new function of Tet in regulating Drosophila early brain development. We found that mutation in the Tet DNA-binding domain (TetAXXC) resulted in axon guidance defects in the mushroom body (MB). Tet is required in early brain development during the outgrowth of MB {beta} axons. Transcriptomic study shows that glutamine synthetase 2 (Gs2), a key enzyme in glutamatergic signaling, is significantly downregulated in the TetAXXC mutant brains. CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis or RNAi knockdown of Gs2 recapitulates the TetAXXC mutant phenotype. Surprisingly, Tet and Gs2 act in the insulin-producing cells (IPCs) to control MB axon guidance, and overexpression of Gs2 in these cells rescues the axon guidance defects of TetAXXC. Treating TetAXXC with the metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist MPEP can rescue while treating with glutamate enhances the phenotype confirming Tet function in regulating glutamatergic signaling. TetAXXC and the Drosophila homolog of Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein protein mutant (Fmr13) have similar axon guidance defects and reduction in Gs2 mRNA levels. Interestingly, overexpression of Gs2 in the IPCs also rescues the Fmr13 phenotype, suggesting functional overlapping of the two genes. Our studies provide the first evidence that Tet can control the guidance of axons in the developing brain by modulating glutamatergic signaling and the function is mediated by its DNA-binding domain.",

However, the Oxford Nanopore long-read cDNA sequencing protocols generate reads that correspond to either the first or second-strand cDNA, therefore the strandedness of the initial transcript has to be inferred bioinformatically. Reverse transcription and PCR can also introduce artefacts which should be flagged in data pre-processing.\n\nHere we introduce Restrander, a lightning-fast and highly accurate tool for restranding and quality checking long-read cDNA sequencing data. Thanks to its C++ implementation, Restrander was faster than Oxford Nanopore Technologies existing tool Pychopper, and correctly restranded more reads due to its strategy of searching for polyA/T tails in addition to primer sequences from the reverse transcription and template-switch steps. We found that restranding improved the process of visualising and exploring data, and increased the number of novel isoforms discovered by bambu, particularly in regions where sense and antisense transcripts co-occur.\n\nThe artefact detection implemented in Restrander quantifies reads which do not have the correct 5 and 3 ends, a feature which is useful in quality control for library preparation. Restrander is pre-configured for all major cDNA protocols, and can be customised with user-defined primers. Restrander is available at https://github.com/jakob-schuster/restrander",

    "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are ubiquitous across all domains of life and play a range of functional roles. While folded domains are generally well-described by a single 3D structure, IDRs exist in a collection of interconverting states known as an ensemble. This structural heterogeneity means IDRs are largely absent from the PDB, contributing to a lack of computational approaches to predict ensemble conformational properties from sequence. Here we combine rational sequence design, large-scale molecular simulations, and deep learning to develop ALBATROSS, a deep learning model for predicting IDR ensemble dimensions from sequence. ALBATROSS enables the instantaneous prediction of ensemble average properties at proteome-wide scale. ALBATROSS is lightweight, easy-to-use, and accessible as both a locally installable software package and a point-and-click style interface in the cloud. We first demonstrate the applicability of our predictors by examining the generalizability of sequence-ensemble relationships in IDRs. Then, we leverage the high-throughput nature of ALBATROSS to characterize emergent biophysical behavior of IDRs within and between proteomes.\n\nUpdate from previous versionO_LIThis preprint reports an updated version of the ALBATROSS network weights trained on simulations of over 42,000 sequences.\nC_LIO_LIIn addition, we provide new colab notebooks that enable proteome-wide IDR prediction and annotation in minutes.\nC_LIO_LIAll conclusions and observations made in versions 1 and 2 of this manuscript remain true and robust.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "There is a recognized need to measure the abundance of microbes in hospital environments, in the sanitation industry, and in food preparation. Doctors, microbiologists, and food safety experts have been addressing this need by using serial dilution methods to grow bacterial colonies in small enough numbers to count and, from these counts, to infer bacterial concentrations measured in Colony Forming Units (CFUs). There are two primary types of such methods: plating bacteria on a growth medium and counting their resulting colonies or counting the number of tubes at a given dilution that have growth. Traditionally, these types of data have been analyzed separately using different analytic methods. Here we build a direct correspondence between these approaches, which allows one to extend the use of the Most Probable Number (MPN) method from the liquid tubes experiments, for which it was developed, to the growth plates. We also discuss how to combine measurements taken at different dilutions, and we review several ways of analyzing colony counts, including the Poison and truncated Poison methods. For all methods, we discuss their relevant error bounds, assumptions, strengths, and weaknesses. We provide an online calculator for these estimators.",

    "abstract": "O_LIPhylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) regression is widely used to analyze evolutionary relationships between two traits. In contrast to the equal treatment of analyzed traits in conventional correlation methods such as Pearson and Spearmans rank tests, we must designate one trait as the independent variable and the other as the dependent variable.\nC_LIO_LIWe retrieved an empirical dataset containing the optimal growth temperature, minimal doubling time, CRISPR-Cas, and prophage contents of 262 bacteria from a recent publication and conducted 16000 simulations of the evolution of two traits along a binary tree with 100 terminal nodes, using different models and variances. Correlations in these two datasets were examined by PGLS regression using Pagels{lambda} model.\nC_LIO_LIBy examining correlations in the empirical dataset, we found that switching independent and dependent variables resulted in conflicting results in 26.3% of cases. PGLS regression analysis of the 16000 simulated data showed that the frequency of conflicting outcomes from switching dependent and independent variables depends on the strength of the relationship between the two analyzed traits. Switching dependent and independent variables would strongly affect the parameter estimation of the PGLS regressions if the two variables differ significantly in their phylogenetic signals. To assess correlations in each simulation, we established a gold standard by analyzing changes in traits along phylogenetic branches. Next, we tested seven potential criteria for dependent variable selection: log-likelihood, Akaike information criterion, R2, p-value, Pagels{lambda} , Blomberg et al.s K, and the estimated{lambda} in Pagels{lambda} model. We determined that the last three criteria performed equally well in selecting the dependent variable and were superior to the other four.\nC_LIO_LISince Pagels{lambda} and Blomberg et al.s K values are indicators of phylogenetic signals, which are commonly calculated at the beginning of phylogenetic comparative studies, we suggest using the trait with a higher{lambda} or K value as the dependent variable for practicality in future PGLS regressions. In analyzing the evolutionary relationship between two traits, we should designate the trait with a stronger phylogenetic signal as the dependent variable even if it could logically assume the cause in the relationship.\nC_LI",

Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and biophysical experiments are often used to study protein dynamics. However, high computational demands of MD limit what timescales are feasible to study, often missing rare events, which are critical to explain experiments. On the other hand, experiments are limited by low resolution. We present dynamic Augmented Markov models (dynAMMo) to bridge the gap between these data and overcome their respective limitations. For the first time, dynAMMo enables the construction of mechanistic models of slow exchange processes that have been not observed in MD data by integrating dynamic experimental observables. As a consequence, dynAMMo allows us to bypass costly and extensive simulations, yet providing mechanistic insights of the system. Validated with controlled model systems and a well-studied protein, dynAMMo offers a new approach to quantitatively model protein dynamics on long timescales in an unprecedented manner.",

    "abstract": "MotivationAnalysis of open chromatin regions across multiple samples from two or more distinct conditions can determine altered gene regulatory patterns associated with biological phenotypes and complex traits. The ATAC-seq assay allows for tractable genome-wide open chromatin profiling of large numbers of samples. Stable, broadly applicable genomic annotations of open chromatin regions are not available. Thus, most studies first identify open regions, or peaks, using peak calling methods for each sample independently. These are then heuristically combined to obtain a consensus peak set. Reconciling sample-specific peak results post hoc from a large cohort is challenging, and informative spatial features specific to open chromatin signals are not leveraged effectively.\n\nResultsWe propose a novel method, ROCCO, that determines consensus open chromatin regions across multiple samples simultaneously. ROCCO uses robust summary statistics across samples by solving a constrained optimization problem formulated to account for both enrichment and spatial features of open chromatin signal data. We show this formulation admits attractive theoretical and conceptual properties as well as superior empirical performance compared to current methodology.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationAn implementation of ROCCO in Python, along with documentation and usage demos, is available on GitHub.\n\nContactnolanh@email.unc.edu or tsfurey@email.unc.edu.\n\nSupplementary InformationSupplementary material is available with this submission.

    "abstract": "The biology of tumors is suffused with spatial interactions, such as tumor-immune signaling through localized cytokine/ligand secretion, cell-cell contacts, and checkpoint ligand/receptor signaling. Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) can serve as a study paradigm for tumor microenvironment (TME) architecture as the defining pathological feature is the scarcity of the malignant Hodgkin and Reed Sternberg (HRS) cells, leaving a diverse and predominantly immune cell rich tumor microenvironment (TME) with complex tumor-immune interactions. Previous studies have identified TME features that are prognostic and predictive, however these studies did not consider the entirety of TME cellular ecosystems, including precisely defined immune cell subsets with opposing inflammatory and immune-suppressive effects, as a determinant for differential clinical course of HL patients. Here we use Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) with 42 antibody markers to profile tumors from 93 patients with HL. Our cohort consists of relapsed/refractory HL with matched diagnostic and relapsed biopsies, and we present a bioinformatic pipeline to profile 10 major cell lineages and their subtypes including spatial interaction mapping. Our pipeline identifies putative biomarker candidates with a focus on \"rosettes\" - local aggregates of immune cells around single tumor cells. In addition to validating existing biomarkers centered on CD68+ macrophages, GranzymeB+CD8+ T cells, and others in HL, we propose new biomarkers based on localized interactions between HRS cells and aggregating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and macrophages involving the immune checkpoints PD1/PDL1, LAG3, and Galectin9. This study serves as a broad tissue imaging resource for multi-timepoint biopsies in HL, and a computational resource and pipeline for users of IMC and other multiplexed imaging studies to perform tissue analysis and biomarker candidate testing with any tissue type.",

Voltage imaging provides unique approaches to addressing this by enabling simultaneous, non-invasive, in vivo recording of voltage dynamics from a population of cells. Recently, genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) facilitate cell-type specific imaging of voltage dynamics. However, it has not been applied to brain development. Here, we applied ArcLight, a GEVI utilizing voltage-sensitive domain, to zebrafish and established experimental approaches for analyzing voltage and morphology of neuron populations during development, focusing on the spinal cord and cerebellum. We initially demonstrated that Arclight was widely distributed in the neural tissues. With voltage imaging, we successfully visualized the coordinated, spontaneous activity of spinal cord neurons in their early stage of development at a high spatiotemporal resolution, at subcellular and population levels. Hyperpolarization and subthreshold signals were also detected. Finally, long-term voltage imaging during development revealed the process of changes in voltage dynamics in neuron populations, accompanied by axonal outgrowth. Voltage imaging could greatly contribute to our understanding of the functional organization of the nervous system during development.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBiocontrol is a key technology for the control of pest species. Microctonus parasitoid wasps (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) have been released in Aotearoa New Zealand as biocontrol agents, targeting three different pest weevil species. Despite their value as biocontrol agents, no genome assemblies are currently available for these Microctonus wasps, limiting investigations into key biological differences between the different species and strains.\n\nMethods and findingsHere we present high-quality genomes for Microctonus hyperodae and Microctonus aethiopoides, assembled with short read sequencing and Hi-C scaffolding. These assemblies have total lengths of 106.7 Mb for M. hyperodae and 129.2 Mb for M. aethiopoides, with scaffold N50 values of 9 Mb and 23 Mb respectively. With these assemblies we investigated differences in reproductive mechanisms, and association with viruses between Microctonus wasps. Meiosis-specific genes are conserved in asexual Microctonus, with in-situ hybridisation validating expression of one of these genes in the ovaries of asexual Microctonus aethiopoides. This implies asexual reproduction in these Microctonus wasps involves meiosis, with the potential for sexual reproduction maintained. Investigation of viral gene content revealed candidate genes that may be involved in virus-like particle production in M. aethiopoides, as well as a novel virus infecting M. hyperodae, for which a complete genome was assembled.\n\nConclusion and significanceThese are the first published genomes for Microctonus wasps used for biocontrol in Aotearoa New Zealand, which will be valuable resources for continued investigation and monitoring of these biocontrol systems. Understanding the biology underpinning Microctonus biocontrol is crucial if we are to maintain its efficacy, or in the case of M. hyperodae to understand what may have influenced the significant decline of biocontrol efficacy. The potential for sexual reproduction in asexual Microctonus is significant given that empirical modelling suggests this asexual reproduction is likely to have contributed to biocontrol decline. Furthermore the identification of a novel virus in M. hyperodae highlights a previously unknown aspect of this biocontrol system, which may contribute to premature mortality of the host pest . These findings have potential to be exploited in future in attempt to increase the effectiveness of M. hyperodae biocontrol.",

Multiple formulations of JS models have been developed and include both maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches. Bayesian approaches offer greater flexibility; however, they are often extremely slow when applied to moderate to large populations because the latent states of all observed individuals, as well as any potential unobserved individuals (parameter-expanded data augmentation), must be simulated at each time step.\nC_LIO_LIJS model implementations can be sped up dramatically through marginalization, whereby the conditional likelihoods of states are tracked for unique capture histories, rather than the simulated states of all individuals. Here we describe a marginalized implementation of a multistate JS model and compare its performance to that of an implementation using simulated discrete states. We fit models to data generated under two scenarios, one in which no data was missing and another in which 25% of data was randomly removed. To illustrate how marginalization can accommodate more complex models and datasets, we describe a modified version of the model for application to populations with transients and fit the model to simulated data and to data collected on Kentucky Warblers (Geothlypis formosa) as part of the Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) program.\nC_LIO_LIBoth the discrete latent state and marginalized JS model implementations performed similarly with respect to bias and coverage; however, the marginalized implementation was roughly 1,000 times faster when no data were missing and 100 times faster when 25% of data was missing. The marginalized model accommodating transients also converged quickly and a more complex version of the model applied to the larger multi-site Kentucky Warbler data set yielded useful estimates of most parameters within a reasonable time frame (hours).\nC_LIO_LIGains in efficiency provided by marginalization shown here should stimulate additional study and development of this useful class of models and provide new opportunities for real-world applications to large complex data sets.\nC_LI",

One of those traits is a genetic XX/XY sex-determination system, which ensures an equal distribution of both sexes. Comparisons of female and male genomic sequences identified the Y-chromosomal copy of the TGF-{beta} family member gdf6 as the candidate male sex-determining (SD) gene, which was named gdf6Y in contrast to the X-chromosomal allele gdf6X. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated inactivation of gdf6Y in N. furzeri led to a complete male-to-female sex reversal in XY animals. The homozygous inactivation of gdf6X on the other hand led to a detrimental phenotype post-hatching. This phenotype was compensated by gdf6Y, revealing that the latter became the SD gene while retaining at least some of its original gdf6 function. Gdf6Y is expressed in testicular somatic cells already prior to hatching, where it represses the germ cell-intrinsic feminizing gene foxl2l. We have identified components of the TGF-{beta} signaling pathway, especially the inhibitor of DNA binding genes id1/2/3, and the mRNA decay activator zfp36l2, as Gdf6Y targets. We conclude that Gdf6Y exerts its function as the male sex-determining gene by suppressing female-specific genes in the developing gonad of male N. furzeri.",

We developed a technique, Extracellular Protein Surface Labeling in Neurons (EPSILON), to map -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) insertion in vivo by pulse-chase labeling of surface AMPARs with membrane-impermeable dyes. This approach allows for single-synapse resolution maps of plasticity in genetically targeted neurons during memory formation. We investigated the relationship between synapse-level and cell-level memory encodings by mapping synaptic plasticity and cFos expression in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells upon contextual fear conditioning (CFC). We observed a strong correlation between synaptic plasticity and cFos expression, suggesting a synaptic mechanism for the association of cFos expression with memory engrams. The EPSILON technique is a useful tool for mapping synaptic plasticity and may be extended to investigate trafficking of other transmembrane proteins.",

    "abstract": "We have previously reported that different stresses can lead to substantial DNA methylation changes in strawberry. Here, we wanted to assess the heritability of heat-stress induced DNA methylation and transcriptional changes following asexual and sexual reproduction in a plant. Woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca) is an ideal model to study epigenetic inheritance in plants because it presents two modes of reproduction: sexual and asexual. Here we wanted to assess if heat-stress induced DNA methylation changes can be transmitted via asexual reproduction and whether past stresses can also affect sexually propagated progenies. Our genome-wide study provides evidence for a memory acquisition and maintenance in F. vesca. We found that certain DNA methylation changes can stably be transmitted over at least three asexual generations. Finally, the first sexual generation by selfing from stressed maternal and their respective non-stressed asexual daughter plants showed both shared and unique stress responses. This suggests that an acquired molecular memory from the previous heat-stress event was transmitted. This molecular memory might be involved in functional plasticity and stress adaption, an important aspects that will have to be investigated in future studies. Finally, these findings may contribute to novel approaches that may contribute to the breeding of climate-ready plants.\n\nIN A NUTSHELLO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSWith ongoing climate change, natural plant populations and crops are facing stress situations more frequently and at higher intensity. These unfavorable growing conditions force plants to develop strategies to adapt to persist. One of these strategies involves epigenetic mechanisms which can affect the activity of genes without altering the actual DNA sequence. These molecular modifications can be retained by plants as a molecular \"memory\" which might be used later to better respond to a stressful event.\n\nQuestionIs there multi-generational persistence of heat-stress induced epigenetic patterns in strawberry and are heritable epigenetic changes associated with stress adaptation?\n\nFindingsWe found that the strawberry methylome and transcriptome respond with a high level of flexibility to heat-stress. In addition, we took advantage of the two reproductive modes of strawberry (asexual and sexual) to evaluate the acquisition and maintenance of molecular stress memory. We showed how specific DNA methylation and gene expression changes can persist for a long time in progeny plants. We found that the asexual, and seemingly also sexual progenies can retain information in the genome of a past stressful condition that was encountered by its progenitor.\n\nNext stepsOur work presents valuable epigenetic and transcriptional screening data to understand plant memory maintenance and transmission over generations. The most important next step will be to assess if heritable stress-induced epigenetic changes can contribute to stress adaptation through a plant competition experiment in natural environments.\n\nOne sentence summaryStrawberry can transmit molecular stress-memory at the DNA methylation and transcriptional level over multiple generations which may play an important role in stress adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Viruses use miRNAs to enable efficient replication, control host defense mechanisms, and regulate latent infection. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) expresses multiple miRNAs, whose functions are largely unknown. The evolutionary conservation of many HSV-1 miRNAs in the closely related HSV-2 suggests their functional importance. miRNAs, similar to other transcripts, can undergo various posttranscriptional modifications that may affect their biogenesis, stability and targeting. To investigate whether editing occurs in HSV-1 miRNAs, we sequenced samples from latently infected human ganglia. We show that one of the six HSV-1 miRNAs (miR-H2 to -H8) that define HSV-1 latency, miR-H2, exhibits A-to-I hyperediting within the miRNA seed sequence. We observed the same specific miR-H2 hyperediting phenomenon in miRNAs isolated from the ganglia of latently infected mice and, to a lesser extent, during productive infection in cultured cells. Curiously, we found no evidence of editing of the encoded HSV-2 homolog in latently infected mice or in cultured cells. The efficient loading of the edited miRNAs onto the RISC complex, indicates their ability to function as miRNAs. To investigate the potential of the edited miRNA to alter mRNA targeting, we predicted the host and viral targets for the modified miRNAs. Nucleotide substitution in the seed region significantly increased the number of potential host and viral targets. Most notably, ICP4, an essential viral protein, was predicted to be an additional target. Using transfection assays, we demonstrated that edited miRNAs have the potential to regulate ICP4 in addition to the previously identified target ICP0. Our study identifies a specific hyperedited HSV-1 mRNA, miR-H2, and highlights how the virus can use a single miRNA to target multiple transcripts during persistent, latent infection.\n\nImportanceHerpes simplex virus 1 is an important human pathogen and intensively studied for many decades. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms regulating its establishment, maintenance, and reactivation from latency are poorly understood. Here, we show that HSV- 1 encoded miR-H2 is post-transcriptionally edited in latently infected human tissues. Hyperediting of viral miRNAs increases the targeting potential of these miRNAs and may play an important role in regulating latency. We show that the edited miR-H2 (miR-H2-e) can target ICP4, an essential viral protein. Interestingly, we found no evidence of hyperdating of its homolog, miR-H2, which is expressed by the closely related virus HSV-2. The discovery of posttranslational modifications of viral miRNA in the latency phase suggests that these processes may also be important for other non-coding viral RNA in the latency phase, including the intron LAT, which in turn may be crucial for understanding the biology of this virus.",

The SAC is especially important during meiosis to maintain genome stability over generations and sustain fertility. However, despite its crucial role for reproduction and breeding, little is known about the plant meiotic SAC. Here, we present a cytological and functional framework of the SAC in male meiocytes of Arabidopsis thaliana. Using live-cell imaging, we have dissected the temporal association of SAC components with the kinetochore and have identified the three conserved kinases BMF1, MPS1 and AURORA as crucial regulators of the loading of BMF3 to kinetochores. Functionally characterizing core SAC components, we found that BUB3.3 has a predominant and previously not recognized role in chromosome congression. We suggest that BUB3.3 is involved in efficient kinetochore-microtubule interactions. Furthermore, the meiotic SAC is only active for a limited time under severe microtubule destabilizing conditions leading to the hypothesis that the relaxed nature of the meiotic SAC is a gateway to polyploidization and hence might contribute to genome evolution in plants.",

However, the effect and molecular mechanism of hypoxia on GVB remains unclear. Here, we show a role of the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) in hypoxia-induced bi-directional regulation of GVB.\n\nApproach and ResultsAn in vitro GVB model composed of rat intestinal microvascular endothelial cells was studied. Evans blue-albumin efflux assay showed that the experimentally severe hypoxia induced by cobalt chloride (500 M, 24 h) markedly disrupted the GVB in vitro, while mild hypoxia induced by cobalt chloride (500 M, 6 h) evidently enhanced the GVB, revealing hypoxia-induced bi-directional regulation of the GVB for the first-time. Importantly, knockdown of HIF-1 largely abolished the bi-directional changes of GVB caused by hypoxia. Furthermore, experimentally severe hypoxia exacerbated the inflammatory GVB disruption induced by LPS or TNF-, while the mild hypoxia promoted the repair.\n\nConclusionCollectively, our data indicate that hypoxia bi-directionally regulates GVB in a HIF-1-dependent manner.",

Although amplification of excitatory signals by local voltage-dependent cation channels has been extensively studied, its spatio-temporal dynamics in elaborate dendritic branches remains obscure because of technical limitation. Using fluorescent voltage imaging throughout dendritic arborizations in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, here we demonstrate a unique Cl--dependent remote computation mechanism equipped in distal branches. Local laser photolysis of caged-glutamate triggered excitatory postsynaptic potentials spreading along dendrites with gradual amplification toward the distal end whereas with attenuation toward the soma. Tour-de-force subcellular patch-clamp recordings from thin branches complemented with biophysical model simulation revealed that the asymmetric augmentation of excitation relies on the TTX-resistant Na+ channels and Cl--conductances accompanied with deeper dendritic resting potential. Taken together, the present study unveils cooperative voltage-dependent actions of cation and anion conductances for dendritic supralinear computation which can locally decode the spatio-temporal context of synaptic inputs.",

We discovered TFPs recruited to the basal body pre- and post-initiation of ciliogenesis with differential expression of TFPs at the assembling new flagellum compared to the existing old flagellum. Knockdown by RNAi of 17 TFPs revealed 6 were necessary for ciliogenesis and a further 3 were necessary for normal flagellum length. We identified 9 TFPs that had a detectable orthologue in at least one basal body-forming eukaryotic organism outside of the kinetoplastid parasites.

It is unknown whether the capacity to pause development is conserved, in general across mammals, and more specifically in humans. Activity of the growth regulating mTOR pathway governs developmental pausing in the mouse (1). Here we show a stage-specific capacity to delay the progression of human development via mTOR inhibition. In this context, human blastoids and pluripotent stem cells in naive and naive-like, but not primed, states can be induced to enter a dormant state, which is reversible at the functional and molecular level. Comparative analysis of mouse and human naive cells longitudinal response to mTORi revealed distinct temporal dynamics and metabolic requirements of dormancy in each species. Mouse and human blastocysts show similar tissue-specific patterns of mTOR pathway activity, suggesting that the mTOR pathway may be a conserved regulator of blastocyst development and timing in both species. Our results raise the possibility that the developmental timing of the human embryo may be controllable, with implications for reproductive therapies.",

    "abstract": "Complex repetitive regions (also called segmental duplications) in eukaryotic genomes often contain essential functional and regulatory information. Despite remarkable algorithmic progress in genome assembly in the last twenty years, modern de novo assemblers still struggle to accurately reconstruct these highly repetitive regions. When sequenced reads will be long enough to span all repetitive regions, the problem will be solved trivially. However, even the third generation of sequencing technologies on the market cannot yet produce reads that are sufficiently long (and accurate) to span every repetitive region in large eukaryotic genomes.\n\nIn this work, we introduce a novel algorithm called RAmbler to resolve complex repetitive regions based on high-quality long reads (i.e., PacBio HiFi). We first identify repetitive regions by mapping the HiFi reads to the draft genome assembly and by detecting un-usually high mapping coverage. Then, (i) we compute the k-mers that are expected to occur only once in the genome (i.e., single copy k-mers, which we call unikmers), (ii) we barcode the HiFi reads based on the presence and the location of their unikmers, (iii) we compute an overlap graph solely based on shared barcodes, (iv) we reconstruct the sequence of the repetitive region by traversing the overlap graph.\n\nWe present an extensive set of experiments comparing the performance of RAmbler against Hifiasm, HiCANU and Verkko on synthetic HiFi reads generated over a wide range of repeat lengths, number of repeats, heterozygosity rates and depth of sequencing (over 140 data sets). Our experimental results indicate that RAmbler outperforms Hifiasm, HiCANU and Verkko on the large majority of the inputs. We also show that RAmbler can resolve several long tandem repeats in Arabidopsis thaliana using real HiFi reads.\n\nThe code for RAmbler is available at https://github.com/sakshar/rambler.\n\nCCS CONCEPTSApplied computing [-&gt;] Bioinformatics; Computational genomics; Molecular sequence analysis; * Theory of computation [-&gt;] Graph algorithms analysis.",

    "abstract": "XL-MS provides low-resolution structural information of proteins in cells and tissues. Combined with quantitation, it can identify changes in the interactome between samples, for example, control and drug-treated cells, or young and old mice. A difference can originate from protein conformational changes altering the solvent-accessible distance separating the cross-linked residues. Alternatively, a difference can result from conformational changes localized to the cross-linked residues, for example, altering the solvent exposure or reactivity of those residues or post-translational modifications on the cross-linked peptides. In this manner, cross-linking is sensitive to a variety of protein conformational features. Dead-end peptides are cross-links attached only at one end to a protein, the other terminus being hydrolyzed. As a result, changes in their abundance reflect only conformational changes localized to the attached residue. For this reason, analyzing both quantified cross-links and their corresponding dead-end peptides can help elucidate the likely conformational changes giving rise to observed differences of cross-link abundance. We describe analysis of dead-end peptides in the XLinkDB public cross-link database and, with quantified mitochondrial data isolated from failing heart versus healthy mice, show how a comparison of abundance ratios between cross-links and their corresponding dead-end peptides can be leveraged to reveal possible conformational explanations.",

    "abstract": "Complex behaviors depend on the precise developmental specification of neuronal circuits, but the relationship between genetic programs for neural development, circuit structure, and behavioral output is often unclear. The central complex (CX) is a conserved sensory-motor integration center in insects that governs many higher order behaviors and largely derives from a small number of Type II neural stem cells. Here, we show that Imp, a conserved IGF-II mRNA-binding protein expressed in Type II neural stem cells, specifies components of CX olfactory navigation circuitry. We show: (1) that multiple components of olfactory navigation circuitry arise from Type II neural stem cells and manipulating Imp expression in Type II neural stem cells alters the number and morphology of many of these circuit elements, with the most potent effects on neurons targeting the ventral layers of the fan-shaped body. (2) Imp regulates the specification of Tachykinin expressing ventral fan-shaped body input neurons. (3) Imp in Type II neural stem cells alters the morphology of the CX neuropil structures. (4) Loss of Imp in Type II neural stem cells abolishes upwind orientation to attractive odor while leaving locomotion and odor-evoked regulation of movement intact. Taken together, our work establishes that a single temporally expressed gene can regulate the expression of a complex behavior through the developmental specification of multiple circuit components and provides a first step towards a developmental dissection of the CX and its roles in behavior.",

To address large unanswered questions regarding exosome biology in vivo, we created the exomap1 transgenic mouse model. In response to Cre recombinase, exomap1 mice express HsCD81mNG, a fusion protein between human CD81, the most highly enriched exosome protein yet described, and the bright green fluorescent protein mNeonGreen. As expected, cell type-specific expression of Cre induced the cell type-specific expression of HsCD81mNG in diverse cell types, correctly localized HsCD81mNG to the plasma membrane, and selectively loaded HsCD81mNG into secreted vesicles that have the size ([~]80 nm), topology (outside out), and content (presence of mouse exosome markers) of exosomes. Furthermore, mouse cells expressing HsCD81mNG released HsCD81mNG-marked exosomes into blood and other biofluids. Using high-resolution, single-exosome analysis by quantitative single molecule localization microscopy, we show here that that hepatocytes contribute [~]15% of the blood exosome population whereas neurons contribute <1% of blood exosomes. These estimates of cell type-specific contributions to blood EV population are consistent with the porosity of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells to particles of [~]50-300 nm in diameter, as well as with the impermeability of blood-brain and blood-neuron barriers to particles >5 nm in size. Taken together, these results establish the exomap1 mouse as a useful tool for in vivo studies of exosome biology, and for mapping cell type-specific contributions to biofluid exosome populations. In addition, our data confirm that CD81 is a highly-specific marker for exosomes and is not enriched in the larger microvesicle class of EVs.",

    "abstract": "During gastrulation, the mesendoderm is firstly specified by morphogens such as Nodal, and then segregates into endoderm and mesoderm in a Nodal concentration-dependent manner. However, so far, the underlying mechanism of this segregation remains unclear. Here, taking zebrafish prechordal plate (PP) and endoderm (Endo) as research model, using single cell multi-omics and live imaging analyses, we show that anterior endodermal progenitors originate directly from prechordal plate. Deconvolution analysis for bulk RNA-seq datasets of Nodal-injected explants reveals that the specification of anterior endoderm from PP was determined by a relatively lower Nodal signaling. And a single-cell transcriptomic trajectory analysis of wild-type, ndr1 knockdown and lefty1 knockout Nodal explants confirms the diversification of Endo fate from PP progenitors. Genstoe Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis indicates that chromatin organization potentially underlies the segregation of endodermal cell fate from PP. A further single-cell ATAC and RNA sequencing analysis suggests a positive correlation between Nodal activity and chromatin openness. We then identify two transcriptional regulators, gsc and ripply1, which are differentially activated in PP and Endo, and manipulation of their expression levels tilts the cell fate decision between these two lineages. Collectively, our study suggests that different levels of Nodal activity promote transcriptional diversification between PP and Endo potentially through modulation of chromatin states, which eventually leads to diversification in cell fate decisions.",

    "abstract": "Dynamins are an essential superfamily of mechanoenzymes that remodel membranes and often contain a \"variable domain\" (VD) important for regulation. For the mitochondrial fission dynamin, Drp1, a regulatory role for the VD is demonstrated by mutations that can elongate, or fragment, mitochondria. How the VD encodes inhibitory and stimulatory activity is unclear. Here, isolated VD is shown to be intrinsically disordered (ID) yet undergoes a cooperative transition in the stabilizing osmolyte TMAO. However, the TMAO stabilized state is not folded and surprisingly appears as a condensed state. Other co-solutes including known molecular crowder Ficoll PM 70, also induce a condensed state. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments reveal this state to be liquid-like indicating the VD undergoes a liquid-liquid phase separation under crowding conditions. These crowding conditions also enhance binding to cardiolipin, a mitochondrial lipid, raising the possibility that phase separation may enable rapid tuning of Drp1 assembly necessary for fission.",

There has been growing interest in recent years in exploring the potential of herbal medicines as a source of safer and alternative therapeutic strategies for the management of AD. This study aims to discover the mechanism of Hypericum perforatum in the management of AD using network pharmacology and molecular docking approach. The results of network pharmacology suggest that 39 bioactive molecules of H. perforatum target 127 genes associated with AD, amongst which ATP-dependent translocase, acetylcholinesterase, amyloid-{beta} precursor protein, {beta}-secretase 1, carbonic anhydrase 2, dipeptidyl peptidase 4, epidermal growth factor receptor, tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 1, -synuclein, and vascular endothelial growth factor A seems to be the prominent target of these molecules. Further, the results of molecular docking predicted amentoflavone, I3,II8-biapigenin, rutin, miquelianin, quercetin, luteolin, and nicotiflorin as a promising modulator of target proteins which were determined from network pharmacology to be associated with AD. Our findings suggest that H. perforatum could be a safer and more promising alternative therapeutic strategy for the management of AD by targeting multiple pathways of AD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the progranulin gene (GRN) are a major cause of frontotemporal dementia due to progranulin haploinsufficiency; complete deficiency of progranulin causes neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. Several progranulin-deficient mouse models have been generated, including both knockout mice and knockin mice harboring a common patient mutation (R493X). However, the GrnR493X mouse model has not been characterized completely. Additionally, while homozygous Grn mice have been extensively studied, data from heterozygous mice is still limited. Here, we performed more in depth characterization of heterozygous and homozygous GrnR493X knockin mice, which includes neuropathological assessment, behavioral studies, and analysis of fluid biomarkers. In the brains of homozygous GrnR493X mice, we found increased expression of lysosomal genes, markers of microgliosis and astrogliosis, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and complement factors. Heterozygous GrnR493X mice exhibited more limited increases in lysosomal and inflammatory gene expression. Behavioral studies found social and emotional deficits in GrnR493X mice that mirror those observed in Grn mouse models, as well as impairment in memory and executive function. Overall, the GrnR493X knockin mouse model closely phenocopies Grn knockout models. Lastly, in contrast to homozygous knockin mice, heterozygous GrnR493X mice do not have elevated levels of fluid biomarkers previously identified in humans, including neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in both plasma and CSF. These results may help to inform pre-clinical studies that use this and other Grn mouse models.",

    "abstract": "Pattern similarity analysis, which uses correlation to examine similarities between neural activation patterns evoked by different trials or conditions, is often leveraged to test hypotheses not easily answerable with univariate comparisons, such as how events are represented or processed and the relationships between representations or processing of events. In principle, univariate analyses of global activation and multivariate analyses of pattern similarity can be used to answer substantively different questions about psychological and neural processing. For this to hold, it is necessary that pattern similarity estimates are not contaminated by differences in global activation across experimental events. Here, we report simulated data that demonstrate that global activation and pattern similarity (as assessed by correlation), although theoretically independent, are often intertwined. We present two plausible scenarios that illustrate how condition-specific changes in global activation can elicit condition-specific increases in pattern similarity by interacting with underlying across-voxel activation patterns. First, we consider a scenario in which a target region contains subpopulations of voxels such that only some voxels in a region are sensitive to a psychological variable and the remaining voxels are not modulated by this variable. In this scenario, this spatial pattern of responsive and unresponsive voxels adds new, shared across-voxel variability for events in the  active condition, thereby increasing pattern similarity between these events. Second, we consider a scenario in which trials from all conditions elicit a shared across-voxel pattern of activation, but this shared across-voxel pattern is amplified for trials within one condition due to greater global activation. In this scenario, the change in activation for a given condition increases the ability to detect pre-existing, shared across-voxel variability across events in that condition, thereby increasing pattern similarity between these events. Given the observed influence of global activation on pattern similarity, we then assess whether it is possible to statistically separate the contributions of global activation and pattern similarity to observed activation patterns (using regression approaches, matching activation across conditions, and inclusion of control conditions).

    "abstract": "Secondary contact of closely related species may lead to hybridization if reproductive isolation is incomplete. Selection against hybrids may become reinforced if hybrid fitness is low. This can be evident from the divergence of isolating traits. We examined habitat use of northern (Glaucomys sabrinus (Shaw, 1801)) and southern (Glaucomys volans (Linnaeus, 1758)) flying squirrels in an area of secondary contact in Ontario, Canada. We looked at summer microhabitat use within sites of sympatry and allopatry to test for evidence of reinforcement due to diverging habitat use. We also examined differences in broad-scale habitat features at woodlots to determine predictors of species occurrence across sites. We used 18 years (2002 - 2019) of flying squirrel summer capture data from 6 sites along a north-south transect. Vegetation surveys were conducted at trap locations during summer 2016 to characterize the available microhabitats within sites. Site-level habitat variables were calculated using the collected microhabitat variables. We found microhabitat variables to be weak predictors of trap-level flying squirrel presence and we found no evidence of divergence in microhabitat use over the 18 years. Further, we found latitude, not broad-scale habitat, was the strongest predictor of site-level flying squirrel occurrence. Overall, our findings suggest that microhabitat-based isolation is not being reinforced between flying squirrels; however, hybridization may be limited to areas where climate and habitat is suitable for both species.",

    "abstract": "Most seabirds delay reproduction for multiple years. The long-standing ecological hypothesis is that seabirds delay reproduction until they pass a foraging efficiency threshold. This foraging development hypothesis is puzzling for seabirds with progressive delayed plumage maturation, such as American Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus smithsonianus). Young American Herring Gulls pass through a distinct series of predefinitive plumages in their early years, suggesting a process of adolescence rather than a binary switch between energetic immaturity and maturity. Drawing on facts from both colonial seabirds and tropical lekking birds, I propose an additional life history hypothesis: young gulls undergo a phase of social development--rather than foraging development alone--during which time predefinitive plumages function as signals that reduce the costs of social engagement at breeding colonies. I tested one facet of the hypothesis: predefinitive gulls have an opportunity for social development at colonies before breeding. A unique prediction is that predefinitive gulls are common at breeding colonies, socially engaged, and not breeding. I conducted counts, quantitative tests of territoriality and conflict, and qualitative behavioral observations of American Herring Gulls at two northwest Atlantic breeding colonies in the summer of 2022. Results supported all three prediction criteria. Birds in an advanced predefinitive plumage stage were common at colonies (2.0-5.8% of census) even while birds in earlier plumage stages were nearly absent (generally <1% of census). These predefinitive birds were socially engaged while loafing on--and losing fights in--foreign territories. Yet only one out of hundreds of predefinitive birds held a territory or nest. This phenomenon suggests the social conditions of breeding colonies can set the stage for social development that, in turn, sets the stage for life history and plumage evolution.",

    "abstract": "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are molecules with two or more fused aromatic rings that occur naturally in the environment due to incomplete combustion of organic substances. However, the increased demand for fossil fuels in recent years has increased anthropogenic activity, contributing to the environmental concentration of PAHs. The enzyme chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida (Pp 1,2-CCD) is responsible for the breakdown of the aromatic ring of catechol, making it an interesting player in bioremediation strategies. Pp 1,2-CCD can tolerate a broader range of substrates, including halogenated compounds, than other dioxygenases. Here, we report the construction of a chimera protein able to form biomolecular condensates with potential application in bioremediation. The chimera protein was built by conjugating Pp 1,2-CCD to low complex domains (LCDs) derived from the DEAD-box protein Dhh1. We showed that the chimera could undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), forming a protein-rich liquid droplet under different conditions (variable protein and PEG8000 concentrations and pH values), in which the protein maintained its structure and main biophysical properties. The condensates were active against 4-chlorocatechol, showing that the chimera droplets preserved the enzymatic activity of the native protein. The possible application of these microreactors in bioremediation is discussed.",

(Science, 378, 160-168, 2022) reported direct imaging of neuronal activity (DIANA) by fMRI in anesthetized mice at 9.4 T, which could be a revolutionary approach for advancing systems neuroscience research. There have been no independent replications of this observation to date. We performed fMRI experiments in anesthetized mice at an ultrahigh field of 15.2 T using the identical protocol as in their paper. The BOLD response to whisker stimulation was reliably detected in the primary barrel cortex before and after DIANA experiments; however, no direct neuronal activity-like fMRI peak was observed in individual animals data with the 50-300 trials used in the DIANA publication. Extensively averaged data involving 1,050 trials in 6 mice (1,050x54 = 56,700 stimulus events) and having a temporal signal-to-noise ratio of 7,370, showed a flat baseline and no detectable neuronal activity-like fMRI peak. Thus we were unable to replicate the previously reported results using the same methods, despite a much higher number of trials, a much higher temporal signal-to-noise ratio, and a much higher magnetic field strength. We were able to demonstrate spurious, non-replicable peaks when using a small number of trials. It was only when performing the inappropriate approach of excluding outliers not conforming to the expected temporal characteristics of the response did we see a clear signal change; however, these signals were not observed when such a outlier elimination approach was not used.",

Lastly, we administered adeno-associated viral gene therapy to neonatal mice and determined if this would prevent these newly identified bowel phenotypes.\n\nResultsMouse models of CLN1 and CLN2 disease both displayed slow bowel transit in vivo that worsened with age. Although the ENS appeared to develop normally, there was a progressive and profound loss of myenteric plexus neurons accompanied by changes in enteric glia in adult mice. Neonatal administration of adeno-associated virus-mediated gene therapy prevented bowel transit defects and the loss of many ENS neurons.\n\nConclusionsWe show that two neurodegenerative lysosomal storage diseases cause profound and progressive damage to the mouse enteric nervous system and impair bowel motility. We also provide proof-of-principle evidence that gene therapy can prevent enteric nervous system disease. This study may have general therapeutic implications for many inherited neurodegenerative disorders.\n\nWhat you need to knowO_ST_ABSBackground and ContextC_ST_ABSMany pediatric central nervous system disorders also have debilitating gastrointestinal symptoms. For most of these diseases, it is not known if the enteric nervous system (ENS) is also affected and to what degree ENS defects contribute to GI symptoms. To date, no attempts have been made to directly treat or prevent enteric nervous system disease via gene therapy.\n\nNew FindingsThe enteric nervous system is severely affected in mouse models of CLN1 and CLN2 disease, profoundly neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorders. Bowel transit defects and most of the enteric nervous system pathology can be prevented by neonatal administration of gene therapy.\n\nLimitationsInformation about enteric nervous system disease in human children is still lacking, and methods will need to be developed to treat the human bowel.\n\nImpactThese findings identify an underappreciated effect of neurodegenerative disease upon the bowel and demonstrate that enteric nervous system degeneration can be prevented in mice. This provides a new perspective on these childhood disorders that may be applicable to many other conditions that affect the bowel.\n\nLay SummaryIn childrens diseases where the brain degenerates, nerve cells in the bowel also die causing gastrointestinal problems, but this can be prevented by gene therapy.",

    "abstract": "Since its emergence in late 2019, infection by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 disease) has quickly spread worldwide, leading to a pandemic that has caused millions of deaths and huge socio-economic losses. Although vaccination against COVID-19 has significantly reduced disease mortality, it has been shown that protection wanes over time, and that circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants may escape vaccine-derived immunity. Therefore, serological studies are still necessary to assess protection in the population and better guide vaccine booster programs. A common measure of protective immunity is the presence of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). However, the gold standard method for measuring nAbs (plaque reduction neutralization test, or PRNT) is laborious and time-consuming, limiting its large-scale applicability. In this study, we developed a high-throughput fluorescence reduction neutralization assay (FRNA) to detect SARS-CoV-2 nAbs. Because the assay relies on immunostaining, we also developed and characterized in-house monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to lower assay costs and reduce the vulnerability of the test to reagent shortages. Using samples collected before the pandemic and from individuals vaccinated against COVID-19, we showed that the results of the FRNA we developed using commercial and in-house mAbs strongly correlated with those of the standard PRNT method while providing results in 70% less time. In addition to providing a fast, reliable, and high-throughput alternative for measuring nAbs, the FRNA can be easily customized to assess other SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs).",

    "abstract": "Biotic and abiotic stresses can severely limit crop productivity. In response to drought, plants close stomata to prevent water loss. Besides, stomata are considered the main entrance of several pathogens. Therefore, the development of natural products to control stomata closure can be considered a sustainable strategy to cope with stresses in agriculture. Plants respond to different stresses by releasing volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Green leaf volatiles (GLVs), which are commonly produced across different plant species after tissue damage, comprise an important group within VOCs. Among them, (Z)-3-hexenyl butyrate (HB) was described as a natural inducer of stomatal closure, playing an important role in stomatal immunity, although its mechanism of action is still unknown. Here, through different genetic, pharmacological, and biochemical approaches, we uncover that HB perception initiates various defense signaling events such as activation of Ca2+ permeable channels, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MPKs) and production of NADPH oxidase-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, HB-mediated stomata closure resulted to be independent of abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis and signaling. Additionally, exogenous treatments with HB alleviate water stress and improve fruit productivity in tomato plants. The efficacy of HB was also tested under open field conditions, leading to enhanced resistance against Phytophthora spp. and Pseudomonas syringae infection in potato and tomato plants, respectively. Taken together, our results provide insights into HB signaling transduction pathway, confirming its role in stomatal closure and plant immune system activation, and proposing HB as a new phytoprotectant for the sustainable control of biotic and abiotic stresses in agriculture.",

    "abstract": "To illuminate the structural origin of catalytic asymmetry of heterodimeric ABC transporters and how it shapes the energetics of their conformational cycles, we used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy (DEER), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, to capture and characterize conformational states of the heterodimeric ABC multidrug exporter BmrCD in lipid nanodiscs. In addition to multiple ATP- and substrate-bound inward-facing (IF) conformations, we obtained the structure of an occluded (OC) conformation wherein the unique extracellular domain (ECD) twists to partially open the extracellular gate. In conjunction with DEER analysis of the populations of these conformations, the structures reveal that ATP-powered isomerization entails changes in the relative symmetry of the BmrC and BmrD subunits that propagates from the transmembrane domain (TMD) to the nucleotide binding domain (NBD). The structures uncover asymmetric substrate and Mg2+ binding which we hypothesize are required for triggering ATP hydrolysis preferentially in one of the nucleotide-binding sites. MD simulations demonstrated that multiple lipid molecules, identified from the cryo-EM density maps, differentially bind the IF versus the OC conformation thus modulating their relative stability. In addition to establishing how lipid interactions with BmrCD modulate the energy landscape, our findings are framed in a distinct transport model that highlights the role of asymmetric conformations in the ATP-coupled cycle with implications to the mechanism of ABC transporters in general.",

    "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii resides in its intracellular niche by employing a series of specialized secretory organelles that play roles in invasion, host-cell manipulation and parasite replication. Rab GTPases are major regulators of the parasites secretory traffic that function as nucleotide dependent molecular switches to control vesicle trafficking. While many of the Rab proteins have been characterized in T. gondii, precisely how these Rabs are regulated remains poorly understood. To better understand the parasites secretory traffic, we investigated the entire family of Tre2-Bub2-Cdc16 (TBC)-domain containing proteins, which are known to be involved in vesicle fusion and secretory protein trafficking. We first determined the localization of all 18 TBC-domain containing proteins to discrete regions of the secretory pathway or other vesicles in the parasite. We then use an auxin-inducible degron approach to demonstrate that the protozoan-specific TgTBC9 protein that localizes to the ER is essential for parasite survival. Knockdown of TgTBC9 results in parasite growth arrest and affects the organization of the ER and Golgi apparatus. We show that the conserved dual-finger active site in the TBC-domain of the protein is critical for its GTPase-activating protein (GAP) function and that the P. falciparum orthologue of TgTBC9 can rescue the lethal knockdown. We additionally show by immunoprecipitation and yeast two hybrid analyses that TgTBC9 directly binds Rab2, indicating that this TBC-Rab pair controls ER to Golgi traffic in the parasite. Together, these studies identify the first essential TBC protein described in any protozoan, provide new insight into intracellular vesicle trafficking in T. gondii, and reveal promising targets for the design of novel therapeutics that can specifically target apicomplexan parasites.",

Upon pathogen recognition by NLR proteins, CARDs recruit and activate caspases, which, in turn, activate gasdermin pore forming proteins to and induce pyroptotic cell death. Here we show that CARD-like domains are present in defense systems that protect bacteria against phage. The bacterial CARD is essential for protease-mediated activation of certain bacterial gasdermins, which promote cell death once phage infection is recognized. We further show that multiple anti-phage defense systems utilize CARD-like domains to activate a variety of cell death effectors. We find that these systems are triggered by a conserved immune evasion protein that phages use to overcome the bacterial defense system RexAB, demonstrating that phage proteins inhibiting one defense system can activate another. We also detect a phage protein with a predicted CARD-like structure that can inhibit the CARD-containing bacterial gasdermin system. Our results suggest that CARD domains represent an ancient component of innate immune systems conserved from bacteria to humans, and that CARD-dependent activation of gasdermins is conserved in organisms across the tree of life.",

Through comparative infection using chimeric alphaviruses and evolutionary selection analyses, we discovered for the first time that CHIKV glycoproteins E2 and E1 coordinate efficient virion production in macrophages with the domains involved under positive selection. We performed proteomics on CHIKV-infected macrophages to identify cellular proteins interacting with the precursor and/or mature forms of viral glycoproteins. We uncovered two E1-binding proteins, signal peptidase complex subunit 3 (SPCS3) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3k), with novel inhibitory activities against CHIKV production. These results highlight how CHIKV E2 and E1 have been evolutionarily selected for viral dissemination likely through counteracting host restriction factors, making them attractive targets for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "AbstractRAS GTPases are proto-oncoproteins that regulate cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation in response to extracellular signals. The signaling functions of RAS, and other small GTPases, are dependent on their ability to cycle between GDP-bound and GTP-bound states. Structural analyses suggest that GTP hydrolysis catalyzed by HRAS can be regulated by an allosteric site located between helices 3, 4 and loop 7. Here we explore the relationship between intrinsic GTP hydrolysis on HRAS and the position of helix 3 and loop 7 through manipulation of the allosteric site, showing that the two sites are functionally connected. We generated several hydrophobic mutations in the allosteric site of HRAS to promote shifts in helix 3 relative to helix 4. By combining crystallography and enzymology to study these mutants, we show that closure of the allosteric site correlates with increased hydrolysis of GTP on HRAS in solution. Interestingly, binding to the RAS binding domain of RAF kinase (RAF-RBD) inhibits GTP hydrolysis in the mutants. This behavior may be representative of a cluster of poorly understood mutations that occur in human tumors, which potentially cooperate with RAF complex formation to stabilize the GTP-bound state of RAS.",

    "abstract": "The urothelium, a distinct epithelial tissue lining the urinary tract, serves as an essential component in preserving urinary tract integrity and thwarting infections. The asymmetric unit membrane (AUM), primarily composed of the uroplakin complex, constitutes a critical permeability barrier in fulfilling this role. However, the molecular architectures of both the AUM and the uroplakin complex have remained enigmatic due to the paucity of high-resolution structural data. In this study, we utilized cryo-electron microscopy to elucidate the three-dimensional structure of the uroplakin complex within the porcine AUM. While the global resolution achieved was 3.5 [A], we acknowledge that due to orientation bias, the resolution in the vertical direction was determined to be 6.3 [A]. Our findings unveiled that the uroplakin complexes are situated within hexagonally arranged crystalline lipid membrane domains, rich in hexosylceramides. Moreover, our research rectifies a misconception in a previous model by confirming the existence of a domain initially believed to be absent, and pinpointing the accurate location of a crucial Escherichia coli binding site implicated in urinary tract infections. These discoveries offer valuable insights into the molecular underpinnings governing the permeability barrier function of the urothelium and the orchestrated lipid phase formation within the plasma membrane.",

    "abstract": "Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a rare but extremely dangerous side effect that has been reported for several adenoviral (Ad)-vectored COVID-19 vaccines. VITT pathology had been linked to production of antibodies that recognize platelet factor 4 (PF4), an endogenous chemokine. In this work we characterize anti-PF4 antibodies obtained from a VITT patients blood. Intact-mass MS measurements indicate that a significant fraction of this ensemble is comprised of antibodies representing a limited number of clones. MS analysis of large antibody fragments (the light chain, as well as the Fc/2 and Fd fragments of the heavy chain) confirms the monoclonal nature of this component of the anti-PF4 antibodies repertoire, and reveals the presence of a fully mature complex biantennary N-glycan within its Fd segment. Peptide mapping using two complementary proteases and LC-MS/MS analysis were used to determine the amino acid sequence of the entire light chain and over 98% of the heavy chain (excluding a short N-terminal segment). The sequence analysis allows the monoclonal antibody to be assigned to IgG2 subclass and verify that the light chain belongs to the {lambda}-type. Incorporation of enzymatic de-N-glycosylation into the peptide mapping routine allows the N-glycan in the Fab region of the antibody to be localized to the framework 3 region of the VH domain. This novel N-glycosylation site (absent in the germline sequence) is a result of a single mutation giving rise to an NDT motif in the antibody sequence. Peptide mapping also provides a wealth of information on lower-abundance proteolytic fragments derived from the polyclonal component of the anti-PF4 antibody ensemble, revealing the presence of all four subclasses (IgG1 through IgG4) and both types of the light chain ({lambda} and {kappa}). The structural information reported in this work will be indispensable for understanding the molecular mechanism of VITT pathogenesis.",

Here, we investigated how T. spiralis miRNAs might remain stable outside of cells. Using proteomics, we identified two RNA binding proteins secreted by T. spiralis larvae and characterised their RNA binding properties. One, a homologue of the known RNA binding protein KSRP, binds miRNA in a selective and sequence-specific fashion.

    "abstract": "Nucleotide repeat expansion of GGGGCC (G4C2) in the non-coding region of C9orf72 is the most common genetic cause underlying amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Transcripts harboring this repeat expansion undergo the translation of dipeptide repeats via a non-canonical process known as repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation. In order to ascertain the essential components required for RAN translation, we successfully recapitulated G4C2-RAN translation using an in vitro reconstituted translation system comprising human factors, namely the human PURE system. Our findings conclusively demonstrate that the presence of fundamental translation factors is sufficient to mediate the elongation from the G4C2 repeat. Additionally, we observed ribosomal frameshifting from the poly Gly-Ala dipeptide frame to other frames during the elongation process. Furthermore, the initiation mechanism proceeded in a 5 cap-dependent manner, independent of eIF2A or eIF2D. In contrast to cell lysate-mediated RAN translation, where longer G4C2 repeats enhanced translation, we discovered that the expansion of the G4C2 repeats inhibited translation elongation using the human PURE system. These results suggest that the repeat RNA itself functions as a repressor of RAN translation. Taken together, our utilization of a reconstituted RAN translation system employing minimal factors represents a distinctive and potent approach for elucidating the intricacies underlying RAN translation mechanism.\n\nSignificance statementEvery cellular protein undergoes synthesis through a process known as translation. While the fundamental aspects of translation have been established, recent advancements have unveiled various noncanonical translation pathways, including the translation originating from \"noncoding\" RNAs. Within this context, certain neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), are linked to the translation of noncoding RNAs, referred to as repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation, the underlying mechanism of which remains controversial. To dissect the complicated nature of RAN translation, this study employs a reconstituted cell-free translation system comprised of human translation factors. By reconstituting RAN translation utilizing a minimal set of factors, this bottom-up approach not only facilitates the elucidation of its mechanism but also offers a distinctive avenue for pharmaceutical development.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma is a rapidly fatal brain cancer with no cure. The resistance of glioblastoma tumours to available therapies means that more effective treatments are desperately needed. Previous research showed that the transcriptional repressor protein BCL6 is upregulated by chemo- and radiotherapy in glioblastoma and that inhibition of BCL6 enhances the effectiveness of these therapies. Therefore, BCL6 is a promising target to improve the efficacy of available treatments for glioblastoma. BCL6 is known as a transcriptional repressor in germinal centre B cells and is an oncogene in lymphoma, as well as in other cancers. However, previous research indicated that BCL6 induced by chemotherapy or irradiation in glioblastoma may not act as a transcriptional repressor. This study aimed to clarify the role of BCL6 in the response of glioblastoma to irradiation. The effect of BCL6 inhibition on the whole proteome response of glioblastoma cells to fractionated and acute irradiation treatment was investigated. Acute irradiation appeared to cause BCL6 to switch from a repressor of the DNA damage response to a promoter of stress response signalling. Rapid immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry of endogenous proteins enabled identification of proteins associated with BCL6 in untreated and irradiated glioblastoma cells. BCL6 associated with transcriptional coregulators in untreated glioblastoma and its association with the corepressor NCOR2 was validated using proximity ligation assays. However, the association of BCL6 with transcriptional regulatory proteins was lost in response to acute irradiation. This was accompanied by the irradiation-induced association of BCL6 with synaptic and plasma membrane proteins. Overall, these results reveal that the activity of BCL6 in glioblastoma therapy responses is context-dependent and may be mediated by the intensity of cellular stress.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer liver metastatic (CRCLM) tumours present as two main histopathological growth patterns (HGPs) including desmoplastic HGP (DHGP) and replacement HGP (RHGP). The DHGP tumours obtain their blood supply by sprouting angiogenesis, whereas the RHGP tumours utilize an alternative vascularisation known as vessel co-option. In vessel co-option, the cancer cells hijack the mature sinusoidal vessels to obtain blood supply. Vessel co-option has been reported as an acquired mechanism of resistance to anti-angiogenic treatment in CRCLM. Herein, we showed that inhibiting proprotein convertase subtilisin-like kexin type 9 (PCSK9) via clinically approved PCSK9-neutralizing antibody (Evolocumab) can boost the response of vessel co-opting tumours to anti-angiogenic therapy. Mechanistically, we found that PCSK9 inhibition downregulates runt related transcription factor-1 (RUNX1) expression levels in CRCLM cancer cells in vivo, which its expression positively correlates with the development of vessel co-option. Collectively, these results suggest that inhibiting PCSK9 is a promising way to improve the efficacy of anti-angiogenic therapy against vessel co-opting tumours in CRCLM.",

    "abstract": "O_LIClassification is a fundamental task in biology used to assign members to a class. While linear discriminant functions have long been effective, advances in phenotypic data collection are yielding increasingly high-dimensional datasets with more classes, unequal class covariances, and non-linear distributions. Numerous studies have deployed machine learning techniques to classify such distributions, but they are often restricted to a particular organism, a limited set of algorithms, and/or a specific classification task. In addition, the utility of ensemble learning or the strategic combination of models has not been fully explored.\nC_LIO_LIWe performed a meta-analysis of 33 algorithms across 20 datasets containing over 20,000 high-dimensional shape phenotypes using an ensemble learning framework. Both binary (e.g., sex, environment) and multi-class (e.g., species, genotype, population) classification tasks were considered. The ensemble workflow contains functions for preprocessing, training individual learners and ensembles, and model evaluation. We evaluated algorithm performance within and among datasets. Furthermore, we quantified the extent to which various dataset and phenotypic properties impact performance.\nC_LIO_LIWe found that discriminant analysis variants and neural networks were the most accurate base learners on average. However, their performance varied substantially between datasets. Ensemble models achieved the highest performance on average, both within and among datasets, increasing average accuracy by up to 3% over the top base learner. Higher class R2 values, mean class shape distances, and between- vs. within-class variances were positively associated with performance, whereas higher class covariance distances were negatively associated. Class balance and total sample size were not predictive.\nC_LIO_LILearning-based classification is a complex task driven by many hyperparameters. We demonstrate that selecting and optimizing an algorithm based on the results of another study is a flawed strategy. Ensemble models instead offer a flexible approach that is data agnostic and exceptionally accurate. By assessing the impact of various dataset and phenotypic properties on classification performance, we also offer potential explanations for variation in performance. Researchers interested in maximizing performance stand to benefit from the simplicity and effectiveness of our approach made accessible via the R package pheble.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The human language system interacts with cognitive and sensorimotor regions during natural language processing. However, where, when, and how these processes occur remain unclear. Existing noninvasive subtraction-based neuroimaging techniques cannot simultaneously achieve the spatial and temporal resolutions required to visualize ongoing information flows across the whole brain. Here we have developed phase-encoded designs to fully exploit the temporal information latent in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, as well as overcoming scanner noise and head-motion challenges during overt language tasks. We captured neural information flows as coherent waves traveling over the cortical surface during listening, reciting, and oral cross-language interpreting. The timing, location, direction, and surge of traveling waves, visualized as  brainstorms on brain  weather maps, reveal the functional and effective connectivity of the brain in action. These maps uncover the functional neuroanatomy of language perception and production and motivate the construction of finer-grained models of human information processing.",

    "abstract": "The biological significance of a small supernumerary marker chromosome that results in dosage alterations to chromosome 9p24.1, including triplication of the GLDC gene encoding glycine decarboxylase, in two patients with psychosis is unclear. In an allelic series of copy number variant mouse models, we identify that triplication of Gldc reduces extracellular glycine levels as determined by optical fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in dentate gyrus (DG) but not in CA1, suppresses long-term potentiation (LTP) in mPP-DG synapses but not in CA3-CA1 synapses, reduces the activity of biochemical pathways implicated in schizophrenia and mitochondrial bioenergetics, and displays deficits in prepulse inhibition, startle habituation, latent inhibition, working memory, sociability and social preference. Our results thus provide a link between a genomic copy number variation, biochemical, cellular and behavioral phenotypes, and further demonstrate that GLDC negatively regulates long-term synaptic plasticity at specific hippocampal synapses, possibly contributing to the development of neuropsychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "Although transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) research demonstrates that dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) influences neuroplasticity within primary motor cortex (M1), it is unclear how ageing modifies this communication. The present study investigated the influence of PMd on different indirect (I) wave inputs within M1 that mediate cortical plasticity in young and older adults. 15 young and 15 older participants completed two experimental sessions that examined the effects of intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) to M1 when preceded by iTBS (PMd iTBS-M1 iTBS) or sham stimulation (PMd sham-M1 iTBS) to PMd. Changes in corticospinal excitability post-intervention were assessed with motor evoked potentials (MEP) recorded from right first dorsal interosseous using posterior-anterior (PA) and anterior-posterior (AP) current single-pulse TMS (PA1mV; AP1mV; PA0.5mV, early I-wave; AP0.5mV, late I-wave). Although PA1mV did not change post-intervention (P = 0.628), PMd iTBS-M1 iTBS disrupted the expected facilitation of AP1mV (to M1 iTBS) in young and older adults (P = 0.002). Similarly, PMd iTBS-M1 iTBS disrupted PA0.5mV facilitation in young and older adults (P = 0.030), whereas AP0.5mV facilitation was not affected in either group (P = 0.218). This suggests that while PMd specifically influences the plasticity of early I-wave circuits, this communication is preserved in older adults.",

Conversely, transient inhibition of the EC-CA1 direct pathway actually improved the temporal coordination of CA1 ensembles (theta sequences), reducing coding heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Environmental heterogeneity can lead to spatially varying selection, which can, in turn, lead to local adaptation. Long-held views in evolutionary biology predict that environmental heterogeneity that is spatially autocorrelated will lead to stronger local adaptation than if it is not. Here I test this explicitly, combining analysis of a dataset from a large-scale provenance trial conducted on lodgepole pine with simulations modelling local adaptation. I find evidence that environmental heterogeneity that is spatially autocorrelated leads to stronger local adaptation in natural populations. Using simulations, I examine how the genetics of local adaptation are influenced by the spatial pattern of environmental heterogeneity. The simulations confirm that local adaptation increases with the degree of spatial autocorrelation in the selective environment, but also show that highly heterogeneous environments are more likely to exhibit high variation in local adaptation, a result not previously described. Spatial autocorrelation in the environment influences the genetic architecture of local adaptation, with different patterns of allele frequency and effect size arising under different patterns of environmental variation. These differences will likely impact the ability to study the genetic basis of local adaptation. Overall, this work emphasizes the profound importance that the spatial pattern of selection can have on the evolution and how spatial autocorrelation should be considered in ecological and genetic studies of local adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) can define distinct cellular identities despite nearly identical DNA-binding specificities. One mechanism for achieving regulatory specificity is DNA-guided TF cooperativity. Although in vitro studies suggest it may be common, examples of such cooperativity remain scarce in cellular contexts. Here, we demonstrate how  Coordinator, a long DNA motif comprised of common motifs bound by many basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and homeodomain (HD) TFs, uniquely defines regulatory regions of embryonic face and limb mesenchyme. Coordinator guides cooperative and selective binding between the bHLH family mesenchymal regulator TWIST1 and a collective of HD factors associated with regional identities in the face and limb. TWIST1 is required for HD binding and open chromatin at Coordinator sites, while HD factors stabilize TWIST1 occupancy at Coordinator and titrate it away from HD-independent sites. This cooperativity results in shared regulation of genes involved in cell-type and positional identities, and ultimately shapes facial morphology and evolution.",
