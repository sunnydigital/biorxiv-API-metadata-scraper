    "abstract": "Eye tracking studies suggest that refixations, fixations to locations previously visited, serve to recover information lost or missed during earlier exploration of a visual scene. These studies have largely ignored the role of precursor fixations, previous fixations on locations the eyes return to later. We consider the possibility that preparations to return later are already made during precursor fixations. This would mark precursor fixations as a special category of fixations, i.e., distinct in neural activity from other fixation categories such as refixations and fixations to locations visited only once. To capture the neural signals associated with fixation categories, we analyzed EEG and eye movement recorded simultaneously in a free-viewing contour search task. We developed a methodological pipeline involving regression-based deconvolution modeling, allowing our analyses to account for overlapping EEG responses due to the saccade sequence and other oculomotor covariates. We found that precursor fixations were preceded by the largest saccades among the fixation categories. Independently of the effect of saccade length, EEG amplitude was enhanced in precursor fixations compared to the other fixation categories 200-400 ms after fixation onsets, most noticeably over the occipital areas. We concluded that precursor fixations play a pivotal role in visual perception, marking the continuous occurrence of transitions between exploratory and exploitative modes of eye movement in natural viewing behavior.",

    "abstract": "Drought severely damages crop production, even under conditions so mild that the leaves show no signs of wilting. However, it is unclear how field-grown plants respond to mild drought. Here, we show through 6 years of field trials that ridges are a useful experimental tool to mimic mild drought stress in the field. Mild drought reduces inorganic phosphate levels in the leaves to activate the phosphate starvation response in soybean plants in the field. Using Arabidopsis thaliana and its mutant plants grown in pots under controlled environments, we demonstrate that phosphate starvation response (PSR) occurs before abscisic acid response under progressive mild drought and that PSR plays a crucial role in plant growth under mild drought. Our observations in the field and laboratory using model crop and experimental plants provide insight into the molecular response to mild drought in field-grown plants and the relationship between nutrition and drought stress response.",

    "abstract": "Standing genetic variation is a major driver of fitness and resilience, and therefore of fundamental importance for threatened species such as stony corals. We analyzed RNA- seq data generated from 132 Montipora capitata and 119 Pocillopora acuta coral colonies collected from K[a]neohe Bay, Oahu, Hawaii. Our goals were to determine the extent of colony genetic variation and to study reproductive strategies in these two sympatric species. Surprisingly, we found that 63% of the P. acuta colonies were triploid, with putative independent origins of the different triploid clades. These corals have spread primarily via asexual reproduction and are descended from a small number of genotypes, whose diploid ancestor invaded the bay. In contrast, all M. capitata colonies are diploid, outbreeding, with almost all colonies genetically distinct. Only two cases of asexual reproduction, likely via fragmentation, were identified in this species. We report two distinct strategies in sympatric coral species that inhabit the largest sheltered body of water in the main Hawaiian Islands. These data highlight divergence in reproductive behavior and genome biology, both of which contribute to coral resilience and persistence.\n\nSignificance StatementGiven the threat posed to coral reef ecosystems by human caused climate change, there is a growing focus on developing strategies for the protection and restoration of these critical marine habitats. These efforts are however limited by our understanding of the diversity of coral survival and reproductive strategies. Our analysis of data from two coral species inhabiting the same Hawaiian bay found that one is a strict sexual outbreeder, whereas the other reproduces predominantly asexually (i.e., clonally) and includes both diploids and triploids. These results broaden our understanding of coral biology, adaptability, and evolution, and underpin future research into the mechanisms of coral resilience that can inform restoration activities.",

    "abstract": "Touch sensation is primarily encoded by mechanoreceptors, called Low-Threshold Mechanoreceptors (LTMRs), with their cell bodies in the Dorsal Root Ganglia. Because of their great diversity in terms of molecular signature, terminal endings morphology and electrophysiological properties, mirroring the complexity of tactile experience, LTMRs are a model of choice to study the molecular cues differentially controlling neuronal diversification. While the transcriptional codes that define different LTMR subtypes have been extensively studied, the molecular players that participate in their late maturation and in particular in the striking diversity of their end-organ morphological specialization are largely unknown. Here we identified the TALE homeodomain transcription factor Meis2 as a key regulator of LTMRs target-field innervation. Meis2 is specifically expressed in cutaneous LTMRs and its expression depends on target-derived signals. While LTMRs lacking Meis2 survived and are normally specified, their end-organ innervations, electrophysiological properties and transcriptome are differentially and markedly affected, resulting in impaired sensory-evoked behavioral responses. These data establish Meis2 as a major transcriptional regulator controlling the orderly formation of sensory neurons innervating peripheral end-organs required for light touch.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila courtship studies have elucidated several principles of the neurogenetic organization of complex behavior. Through an integration across sensory modalities, males perform stereotypic patterns of chasing, courtship song production, and copulation attempts. Here we report a serendipitous finding that intense light not only enhances courtship toward female targets but also triggers unexpected courtship behaviors among male flies. Strikingly, in wild-type male-only chambers, we observed extreme behavioral manifestations, such as \"chaining\" and \"wheeling\", resembling previously reported male-male courtship behaviors in fruitless mutants and in transformants with ectopic mini-white+ overexpression. This male-male courtship was greatly diminished in a variety of visual system mutants, including disrupted phototransduction (norpA), eliminated eye-color screening pigments (white), or deletion of the R7 photoreceptor cells (sevenless). However, light-induced courtship was unhampered in wing-cut flies, despite their inability to produce courtship song, a major acoustic signal during courtship. Unexpectedly the olfactory mutants orco and sbl displayed unrestrained male-male courtship. Particularly, orco males attained maximum courtship scores under either dim or intense light conditions. Together, our observations support the notion that the innate male courtship behavior is restrained by olfactory cues under normal conditions but can be unleashed by strong visual stimulation in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation is critical to the regulation of transposable elements and gene expression, and can play an important role in the adaptation of stress response mechanisms in plants. Traditional methods of methylation quantification rely on bisulfite conversion that can compromise accuracy. Recent advances in long-read sequencing technologies allow for methylation detection in real time. The associated algorithms that interpret these modifications have evolved from strictly statistical approaches to Hidden Markov Models and, recently, deep learning approaches. Much of the existing software focuses on methylation in the CG context, but methylation in other contexts is important to quantify, as it is extensively leveraged in plants. Here, we present methylation profiles for two maple species across the full range of 5mC sequence contexts using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-reads. Hybrid and reference-guided assemblies were generated for two new Acer accessions: Acer negundo (65x ONT and 111X Illumina) and Acer saccharum (93x ONT and 148X Illumina). The ONT reads generated for these assemblies were re-basecalled, and methylation detection was conducted in a custom pipeline with the published Acer references (PacBio assemblies) and hybrid assemblies reported herein to generate four epigenomes. Examination of the transposable element landscape revealed the dominance of LTR Copia elements and patterns of methylation associated with different classes of TEs. Methylation distributions were examined at high resolution across gene and repeat density and described within the broader angiosperm context, and more narrowly in the context of gene family dynamics and candidate nutrient stress genes.",

    "abstract": "Many mammalian proteins have circadian cycles of production and degradation, and many of these rhythms are altered post-transcriptionally. We used ribosome profiling to examine post-transcriptional control of circadian rhythms by quantifying RNA translation in the liver over a 24-h period from circadian-entrained mice transferred to constant darkness conditions and by comparing ribosome binding levels to protein levels for 16 circadian proteins. We observed large differences in ribosome binding levels compared to protein levels, and we observed delays between peak ribosome binding and peak protein abundance. We found extensive binding of ribosomes to upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in circadian mRNAs, including the core clock gene Period2 (Per2). An increase in the number of uORFs in the 5UTR was associated with a decrease in ribosome binding in the main coding sequence and a reduction in expression of synthetic reporter constructs. Mutation of the Per2 uORF increased luciferase and fluorescence reporter expression in 3T3 cells and increased luciferase expression in PER2:LUC MEF cells. Mutation of the Per2 uORF in mice increased Per2 mRNA expression, enhanced ribosome binding on Per2, and reduced total sleep time compared to that in wild-type mice. These results suggest that uORFs affect mRNA post-transcriptionally, which can impact physiological rhythms and sleep.\n\nSignificance StatementPeriod (Per) is an iconic gene in the field of circadian rhythms since its discovery in 1971 by Seymour Benzer and Ronald Konopka in fruit flies. The inhibitory feedback loop of PER protein drives circadian rhythms. We show that Per2 is regulated by an upstream open reading frame (uORF) in the 5 untranslated region of Period2 mRNA. Mutation of the Per2 uORF altered the amplitude of luciferase reporter expression in well-characterized cell culture models. Per2 uORF mutant mice had significantly elevated Per2 mRNA levels and exhibited sleep loss, particularly during light-to-dark and dark-to-light transitions, which suggests a role for uORFs in modulating molecular and physiological circadian rhythms.",

In this study we targeted the plasma membrane organization of PD-L1 in a Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) cell line by a multiscale fluorescence imaging toolbox that included super-resolution microscopy approaches to reach the nanoscale. Our findings revealed for the first time that PD-L1 is prevalently engaged in the cholesterol-enriched \"raft\" regions of the cell membrane.

We present optimized CPU and GPU implementations of the recursive least-squares algorithm in spiking neural networks. The GPU implementation can train networks of one million neurons, with 100 million plastic synapses and a billion static synapses, about 1000 times faster than an unoptimized reference CPU implementation. We demonstrate the codes utility by training a network, in less than an hour, to reproduce the activity of > 66, 000 recorded neurons of a mouse performing a decision-making task. The fast implementation enables a more interactive in-silico study of the dynamics and connectivity underlying multi-area computations. It also admits the possibility to train models as in-vivo experiments are being conducted, thus closing the loop between modeling and experiments.",

Prior studies to determine the function of these cells have yielded conflicting results, possibly due to functional heterogeneity among this B cell population. To better define the role(s) of atypical B cells in the host adaptive immune response, we performed single-cell sequencing of transcriptomes, cell surface markers, and B cell receptors in individuals with chronic Plasmodium falciparum exposure, a condition known to lead to accumulation of circulating atypical B cells. Our studies identified three previously uncharacterized populations of atypical B cells with distinct transcriptional and functional profiles, that separate into two differentiation pathways. We identified a set of cell surface markers to distinguish these atypical B cell subsets and confirmed their presence in malaria-experienced children and adults using flow cytometry. Plasmodium falciparum-specific cells were present in equal proportions within each of these atypical B cell populations, indicating that all three subsets develop in response to antigen stimulation. However, we observed marked differences among the three subsets in their ability to produce IgG upon T-cell-dependent activation. Collectively, our findings help explain the conflicting observations in prior studies on the functions of atypical B cells and provide a better understanding of their role in the adaptive immune response in chronic inflammatory conditions.\n\nOne sentence summaryAtypical B cells consist of three subsets that may play distinct roles in the host adaptive immune response.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the dynamic pathogenesis and treatment response in pulmonary diseases requires probing the lung at cellular resolution in real-time. Despite recent progress in intravital imaging, optical imaging of the lung during active respiration and circulation has remained challenging. Here, we introduce the crystal ribcage: a transparent ribcage that (i) allows truly multiscale optical imaging of the lung in health and disease from whole-organ to single cell, (ii) enables the modulation of lung biophysics and immunity through intravascular, intrapulmonary, intraparenchymal, and optogenetic interventions, and (iii) preserves the 3-D architecture, air-liquid interface, cellular diversity, and respiratory-circulatory functions of the lung. Utilizing these unprecedented capabilities on murine models of primary and metastatic lung tumors, respiratory infection, pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema, and acute lung injury we probed how disease progression remodels the respiratory-circulatory functions at the single alveolus and capillary levels. In cancer, we identified the earliest stage of tumorigenesis that compromises alveolar and capillary functions, a key state with consequences on tumor progression and treatment response. In pneumonia, we mapped mutual links between the recruited immune cells and the alveolar-capillary functions. We found that neutrophil migration is strongly and reversibly responsive to vascular pressure with implications for understanding of how lung physiology, altered by disease and anatomical location, affects immune cell activities. The crystal ribcage and its broad applications presented here will facilitate further studies of real-time remodeling of the alveoli and capillaries during pathogenesis of nearly any pulmonary disease, leading to the identification of new targets for treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "Animal pigment patterns are excellent models to elucidate mechanisms of biological organization. Although theoretical simulations, such as Turing reaction-diffusion systems, recapitulate many animal patterns, they are insufficient to account for those showing a high degree of spatial organization and reproducibility. Here, we compare the coats of the African striped mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio) and the laboratory mouse (Mus musculus) to study the molecular mechanisms controlling stripe pattern formation. By combining transcriptomics, mathematical modeling, and mouse transgenics, we show that Sfrp2 regulates the distribution of hair follicles and establishes an embryonic prepattern that foreshadows pigment stripes. Moreover, by developing and employing in vivo gene editing experiments in striped mice, we find that Sfrp2 knockout is sufficient to alter the stripe pattern. Strikingly, mutants also exhibit changes in coat color, revealing an additional function of Sfrp2 in regulating hair color. Thus, a single factor controls coat pattern formation by acting both as an orienting signaling mechanism and a modulator of pigmentation. By uncovering a multifunctional regulator of stripe formation, our work provides insights into the mechanisms by which spatial patterns are established in developing embryos and the molecular basis of phenotypic novelty.",

Beta distributions are suitable to quantify inclusion levels of alternative sequences, using reads supporting their inclusion and exclusion as surrogates for the two distribution shape parameters. Each such beta distribution has the PSI as its mean value and is narrower when the read coverage is higher, facilitating the interpretability of its precision when plotted. We herein introduce a computational pipeline, based on beta distributions accurately modelling PSI values and their precision, to quantitatively and visually compare AS between groups of samples. Our methodology includes a differential splicing significance metric that compromises the magnitude of inter-group differences, the estimation uncertainty in individual samples, and the intra-group variability, being therefore suitable to multiple-group comparisons.

    "abstract": "Each brain response to a stimulus is, to a large extent, unique. However this variability, our perceptual experience feels stable. Standard decoding models, which utilise information across several areas to tap into stimuli distributed representations and processing, are fundamentally based on averages and, therefore, can focus precisely on the features that are most stable across stimulus presentations. But what are these stable features that may sustain stable perception across experiences is still poorly understood. This question is difficult to address in the absence of a generative model of the signal. Here, I introduce genephys, a generative model of brain responses to stimulation publicly available as a Python package that, when confronted with a decoding algorithm, can reproduce the structured patterns of decoding accuracy observed in real data. Using this approach, I characterise how these patterns may be brought about by the different aspects of the signal, which in turn may translate into distinct putative neural mechanisms. In particular, the model shows that the features in the data that support successful decoding --and, therefore, likely reflect stable mechanisms of stimulus representation-- have an oscillatory component that spans multiple channels, frequencies and latencies of response; and an additive, slower response with a specific (cross-frequency) relation to the phase of the oscillatory, faster component. At the individual trial level, still, responses are found to be highly variable, which can be due to various factors including phase noise and probabilistic activations.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we consider axonal transport of large cargo vesicles characterised by transient expansion of the axon shaft. Our goal is to formulate a mathematical model which captures the dynamic mechanical interaction of such cargo vesicles with the membrane associated periodic cytoskeletal structure (MPS). It consists of regularly spaced actin rings that are transversal to the longitudinal direction of the axon and involved in the radial contraction of the axon. A system of force balance equations is formulated by which we describe the transversal rings as visco-elastic Kelvin-Voigt elements. In a homogenisation limit, we reformulate the model as a free boundary problem for the interaction of the submembranous MPS with the large vesicle. We derive a non-linear force-velocity relation as a quasi-steady state solution. Computationally we analyse the vesicle size dependence of the transport speed and use an asymptotic approximation to formulate it as a power law that can be tested experimentally.",

    "abstract": "In humans, screams have strong amplitude modulations (AM) at 30 to 150 Hz. These AM correspond to the acoustic correlate of perceptual roughness. In bats, distress calls can carry AMs, which elicit heart rate increases in playback experiments. Whether amplitude modulation occurs in fearful vocalisations of other animal species beyond humans and bats remains unknown. Here we analysed the AM pattern of rats 22-kHz ultrasonic vocalisations emitted in a fear conditioning task. We found that the number of vocalisations decreases during the presentation of conditioned stimuli. We also observed that AMs do occur in rat 22-kHz vocalisations. AMs are stronger during the presentation of conditioned stimuli, and during escape behaviour compared to freezing. Our results suggest that the presence of AMs in vocalisations emitted could reflect the animals internal state of fear related to avoidance behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Barn owls experience increasing interaural time differences (ITDs) during development, because their head width more than doubles in the month after hatching. We therefore hypothesized that their ITD detection circuit might be modified by experience. To test this, we raised owls with unilateral ear inserts that delayed and attenuated the acoustic signal, then measured the ITD representation in the brainstem nucleus laminaris (NL) when they were adult. The ITD circuit is composed of delay line inputs to coincidence detectors, and we predicted that plastic changes would lead to shorter delays in the axons from the manipulated ear, and complementary shifts in ITD representation on the two sides. In owls that received ear inserts starting around P14, the maps of ITD shifted in the predicted direction, but only on the ipsilateral side, and only in those tonotopic regions that had not experienced auditory stimulation prior to insertion. The contralateral map did not change. Experience-dependent plasticity of the ITD circuit occurs in NL, and our data suggest that ipsilateral and contralateral delays are independently regulated. Thus, altered auditory input during development leads to long-lasting changes in the representation of ITD.\n\nSignificance StatementThe early life of barn owls is marked by increasing sensitivity to sound, and by increasing ITDs. Their prolonged post-hatch development allowed us to examine the role of altered auditory experience on the development of ITD detection circuits. We raised owls with a unilateral ear insert and found that their maps of ITD were altered by experience, but only in those tonotopic regions that had not experienced auditory stimulation prior to insertion. Thus experience-induced plasticity allows the sound localization circuits to be customized to individual characteristics, such as the size of the head, and potentially to compensate for natural conductive hearing losses.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic differences between urban and rural populations are well-documented, but the evolutionary processes driving trait variation along urbanization gradients are often unclear. We combined spatial data on abundance, trait variation, and measurements of fitness to understand cline structure and test for natural selection on heritable coat color morphs (melanic, gray) of eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) along an urbanization gradient. Population surveys using remote cameras and visual counts at 76 sites along the urbanization gradient revealed a significant cline in melanism, decreasing from 48% in the city center to <5% in rural woodlands. Among 76 translocated squirrels to test for phenotypic selection, survival was lower for the melanic than gray morph in rural woodlands, whereas there was no difference in survival between color morphs in the city. These results suggest the urban-rural cline in melanism is explained by natural selection favoring the gray morph in rural woodlands combined with relaxed selection in the city. Our study illustrates how trait variation between urban and rural populations can emerge from selection primarily in rural populations rather than adaptation to novel features of the urban environment.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotes, hundreds of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes are clustered at chromosomal loci called nucleolus organizer regions (NORs). Arabidopsis thaliana has two NORs, one on chromosome 2 (NOR2) and the other on chromosome 4 (NOR4). Each NOR consists of [~] 400 rRNA gene copies. We recently showed that rRNA gene subtypes that map to NOR2 are silenced during development, whereas those that map to NOR4 are active. In several DNA methylation mutants of Arabidopsis, we show disruption of the NOR2 gene silencing to varying degrees. Significantly, the highest disruption of NOR2 gene silencing correlates with a maximum loss of cytosine methylation in the CHH context followed by the CG context, independent of RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). Next, we show in Col-0 that NOR2 genes are relatively hypermethylated and NOR4 genes are hypomethylated using multiple methylation analysis of genomic DNA carried out with different types of methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes. We demonstrate similar differential methylation status between NOR2 and NOR4 genes in an introgression line named ColSf-NOR4, which carries NOR2 from Col-0 and NOR4 from ecotype Sf-2. Lastly, using Tn5 transposon-mediated transposition into native chromatin, we show that NOR2 gene chromatin is in more condensed state than NOR4 gene chromatin.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptome prediction models built with data from European-descent individuals are less accurate when applied to different populations because of differences in linkage disequilibrium patterns and allele frequencies. We hypothesized methods that leverage shared regulatory effects across different conditions, in this case, across different populations may improve cross-population transcriptome prediction. To test this hypothesis, we made transcriptome prediction models for use in transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) using different methods (Elastic Net, Joint-Tissue Imputation (JTI), Matrix eQTL, Multivariate Adaptive Shrinkage in R (MASHR), and Transcriptome-Integrated Genetic Association Resource (TIGAR)) and tested their out-of-sample transcriptome prediction accuracy in population-matched and cross-population scenarios. Additionally, to evaluate model applicability in TWAS, we integrated publicly available multi-ethnic genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics from the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology Study (PAGE) and Pan-UK Biobank with our developed transcriptome prediction models. In regard to transcriptome prediction accuracy, MASHR models performed better or the same as other methods in both population-matched and cross-population transcriptome predictions. Furthermore, in multi-ethnic TWAS, MASHR models yielded more discoveries that replicate in both PAGE and PanUKBB across all methods analyzed, including loci previously mapped in GWAS and new loci previously not found in GWAS. Overall, our study demonstrates the importance of using methods that benefit from different populations effect size estimates in order to improve TWAS for multi-ethnic or underrepresented populations.",

    "abstract": "Myriad bacterial anti-phage systems have been described and often the mechanism of programmed cell death is invoked for phage inhibition. However, there is little evidence of  suicide under physiological conditions for these systems. Instead of death to stop phage propagation, we show here that persister cells, i.e., transiently-tolerant, dormant, antibiotic-insensitive cells, are formed and survive using the Escherichia coli C496_10 tripartite toxin/antitoxin system MqsR/MqsA/MqsC to inhibit T2 phage. Specifically, MqsR/MqsA/MqsC inhibited T2 phage by one million-fold and reduced T2 titers by 500-fold. During T2 phage attack, in the presence of MqsR/MqsA/MqsC, evidence of persistence include the single-cell physiological change of reduced metabolism (via flow cytometry), increased spherical morphology (via transmission electron microscopy), and heterogeneous resuscitation. Critically, we found restriction-modification systems (primarily EcoK McrBC) work in concert with the toxin/antitoxin system to inactivate phage, likely while the cells are in the persister state. Phage attack also induces persistence in Klebsiella and Pseudomonas spp. Hence, phage attack invokes a stress response similar to antibiotics, starvation, and oxidation, which leads to persistence, and this dormant state likely allows restriction/modification systems to clear phage DNA.",

    "abstract": "Immunological control of viral infection in the brain is essential for immediate protection, but also for long-term maintenance of brain integrity. As the primary resident immune cell of the brain, microglia protect against viral infections through key macrophage functions, including release of the antiviral type I interferons (IFN-I) and clearance of infected cells. Microglia express the cytosolic DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), which can bind viral DNA leading to signaling through stimulator of interferon genes (STING), and downstream immune activation. Here we report that herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 infection of microglia leads to activation of IFN-I genes and pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, HSV1 also down-regulated expression of a subset of genes, including genes in the pathway engaged by the microglial receptor triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2). Knockdown experiments revealed that TREM2 is important for viral activation of cGAS-STING signaling in microglia, induction of IFN-I, and phagocytosis of HSV1 infected neurons. Consequently, TREM2 depletion increased susceptibility to HSV1 infection in human microglia-neuron co-cultures and mice in vivo. Mechanistically, we show that TREM2 is essential for phosphorylation of STING, and downstream activation of the IFN-inducing transcription factor IRF3. We conclude that TREM2 is a novel component of the antiviral immune response in microglia, crucial for immediate host defense against HSV1 in the brain. Since both TREM2 loss-of-function mutations and HSV1 serological status are linked to development of Alzheime[r]s disease (AD), this work opens the question whether defects in TREM2 could predispose to impaired viral clearance and post-infection pathological neurological changes.",

    "abstract": "The intestine is the primary colonisation site for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and serves as a reservoir of CRE that cause invasive infections (e.g. bloodstream infections). Antibiotics disrupt colonisation resistance mediated by the gut microbiota, promoting the expansion of CRE within the intestine. We used ex vivo faecal cultures to measure the impact of antibiotics (that promote CRE intestinal colonisation) on the faecal microbiota from healthy human donors. We demonstrated that antibiotics decreased the abundance of gut commensals (including Bifidobacteriaceae and Bacteroidales) in human faecal microbiota, resulting in an enrichment of nutrients and a depletion of microbial metabolites. We measured the nutrient utilisation abilities, nutrient preferences, and metabolite inhibition susceptibilities of several carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae strains, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter hormaechei. Nutrients (which were elevated with antibiotics) acted as carbon and nitrogen sources to support CRE growth, where CRE strains showed an ordered preference for specific nutrients. These nutrients were also increased in faeces from antibiotic-treated mice but decreased following intestinal colonisation with carbapenem-resistant E. coli. Microbial metabolites (which decreased with antibiotics) were inhibitory towards CRE growth in vitro. Carbapenem-resistant E. coli growth was decreased in faecal samples from mice treated with a mixture of inhibitory metabolites compared with PBS-treated mice. These findings demonstrated that killing gut commensals with antibiotics disrupts colonisation resistance by enriching nutrients that support CRE growth and depleting metabolites that inhibit CRE growth. These results support the development of new microbiome therapeutics to prevent CRE intestinal colonisation, which would also prevent the subsequent development of invasive CRE infections.",

In the present study, we examined the expression of 38 neuropeptides, and glutamatergic neuron marker gene mix (slc17a6a, slc17a6b, slc17a7a, and slc17a7b) in the adult zebrafish brain using in situ hybridization. The results are summarized as an expression atlas in 19 coronal planes of the forebrain. Furthermore, the scan data of all sections were made publicly available as a database. Based on these data, we performed detailed neuroanatomical analyses of the hypothalamus. By scrutinizing and comparing the expression patterns of neuropeptides, we found that several regions described as one nucleus in the reference zebrafish brain atlas contain two or more subregions with significantly different neuropeptide/neurotransmitter expression profiles, and we proposed them as novel subnuclei. Subsequently, the expression data obtained in this study were compared with those in mice, and a cluster analysis was performed to examine the similarities. As a result, several nuclei in zebrafish and mice were clustered in close vicinity: zebrafish ventral part of the anterior part of the parvocellular preoptic nucleus (PPav)/magnocellular preoptic nucleus (PM) and mouse paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (Pa), zebrafish posterior part of the parvocellular preoptic nucleus (PPp) and mouse medial preoptic area (MPA), zebrafish dorsal part of the ventral zone of periventricular hypothalamus (Hvd)/anterior tuberal nucleus (ATN) and mouse ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMN).

In this regard, the role of the spatial organization of the genome on gene expression and vice versa remains practically unexplored. The genome of these parasites is partitioned into core (highly conserved syntenic) and species-specific disruptive regions (synteny disruption), containing multigene families encoding for surface glycoproteins. By mapping genome-wide chromatin interactions we demonstrate that these regions constitute 3D compartments (C and D). These chromatin compartments present significant differences in DNA methylation, nucleosome positioning and chromatin interactions, affecting genome expression dynamics. We show that the genome is organized into chromatin folding domains and transcription is dramatically determined by the local chromatin structure.

Besides the effects of specific mutations on thyroid cancer development, the molecular mechanisms controlling tumorigenesis, tumor behavior, and drug resistance are still largely unknown. Cancer organoids have been proposed as a powerful tool to study aspects related to tumor development and progression and appear promising to test individual responses to therapies. Here, using mESC-derived thyroid organoids, we developed a BrafV637E-inducible model able to recapitulate the features of papillary thyroid cancer in vitro. Overexpression of BrafV637E rapidly leads to MAPK activation, cell dedifferentiation, and disruption of follicular organization. BrafV637E-expressing organoids show a transcriptomic signature for p53, focal adhesion, ECM-receptor interactions, EMT, and inflammatory signaling pathways. Finally, PTC-like thyroid organoids were used for drug screening assays. The combination of MAPK and PI3K inhibitors reversed Braf oncogene-promoted cell dedifferentiation while restoring thyroid follicle organization and function in vitro. Our results demonstrate that pluripotent stem cells-derived thyroid cancer organoids can mimic tumor development and features while providing an efficient tool for testing novel targeted therapies.",

    "abstract": "Maternal Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy can associate with severe intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), placental damage, and metabolism disturbance, as well as newborn neurological abnormalities. Here, we investigated whether maternal ZIKV infection affects placental nutrient transporters and nutrient-sensitive pathways. Immunocompetent (C57BL/6) mice were injected with Low (103 PFU-ZIKVPE243) and High (5x107 PFU-ZIKVPE243) ZIKV titers at gestational day (GD) 12.5, for tissue collection at GD18.5 (term). Feto-placental growth of male fetuses was dramatically affected by ZIKV, whereas no differences were observed in female fetuses. ZIKV promoted increased expression of glucose transporter type 1 (Slc2a1/Glut1) and decreased levels of glucose-6-phosphate in female placentas, with no differences in amino-acid transport potential. In contrast, glucose transport in male placentas was not affected by ZIKV, whilst a decreased placental protein expression of sodium-coupled neutral amino acid 2 (Snat2) was detected in the male low-dose ZIKV-infected group. There were also sex-dependent differences in the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) and O-GlcNAcylation in ZIKV infected pregnancies, showing that ZIKV can cause disturbance in the nutrient handling in the placental tissue. Our findings thus identify relevant molecular alterations in the placenta caused by maternal ZIKV infection related to nutrient transport and availability. Notably, our results suggest that female and male placentas adopt different strategies to cope with the altered metabolic state caused by ZIKV. This may have relevance for understanding the effects of congenital Zika syndrome and could potentially assist future therapeutic strategies.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe Zika virus (ZIKV) has emerged as a major global health concern in the past decade. ZIKV infection during pregnancy can cause infants to be born with microcephaly and fetal growth restriction, among other pregnancy complications. Currently, the number of cases of ZIKV disease declined onwards globally. However, transmission persists at low levels in several countries in the Americas and other endemic regions, with neither a licensed vaccine nor an antiviral drug available for prevention and treatment. Here, we use a mice model of maternal ZIKV infection to analyze placental nutrient transporters and nutrient-sensitive pathways as a potential link to the complications related to congenital ZIKV infection. We found that feto-placental growth of male fetuses was dramatically affected by ZIKV, whereas no differences were observed in female fetuses. We also found that placental nutrient transporters and nutrient-sensitive pathways were altered in response to ZIKV infection, depending on the fetal sex. Our study presents relevant molecular alterations caused by maternal ZIKV infection and suggests that female and male placentas adopt different strategies in response to the altered environment caused by ZIKV. Our observations may have relevance for understanding the effects of ZIKV infection and could potentially assist future therapeutic strategies.",

ETT surfaces promote (poly)microbial colonization and biofilm formation, with a heavy burden for VAP. Devising safe, broad-spectrum antimicrobial materials to tackle ETT bioburden is needful. Herein, we immobilized ciprofloxacin (CIP) and/or chlorhexidine (CHX), through polydopamine (pDA)-based functionalization, onto polyvinyl chloride (PVC) surfaces. These surfaces were characterized and challenged with single and polymicrobial cultures of VAP-relevant bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Acinetobacter baumannii; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcus epidermidis) and fungi (Candida albicans). The coatings imparted PVC surfaces with homogeneous morphology, varied wettability, and low roughness. Coated surfaces exhibited sustained CIP/CHX release, retaining long-term (10 days) stability. Surfaces evidencing no A549 lung cell toxicity exhibited broad-spectrum anti-biofilm activity. CIP/CHX co-immobilization resulted in better outcomes than CIP or CHX coatings, reducing bacteria up to >7 Log10, and modestly distressing (ca. 1 Log10) C. albicans. The anti-biofilm effectiveness of coated surfaces endured for dual biofilms, substantially preventing bacterial populations and fungi (ca. 2.7 Log10) in P. aeruginosa/C. albicans consortia. A less pronounced antifungal effect (ca. 1 Log10 reduction) was found in triple-species communities, but fully preventing P. aeruginosa and S. aureus populations. CIP/CHX co-immobilization holds a safe and robust broad-spectrum antimicrobial coating for PVC-ETTs, with the promise laying in reducing VAP incidence.",

We assembled a large, global dataset on mutualistic traits and species ranges to investigate how multiple plant-animal and plant-microbe mutualisms affect the spread of legumes and ants to novel ranges. We found that generalized mutualisms increase the likelihood that a species establishes and thrives beyond its native range, whereas specialized mutualisms either do not affect or reduce non-native spread. This pattern held in both legumes and ants, indicating that specificity between mutualistic partners is a key determinant of ecological success in a new habitat.

Understanding it is important both from the fundamental point of view and for medical diagnostics based on cell-free DNA (cfDNA), which originates from genomic DNA regions protected from digestion by nucleosomes. Here we generated ultra-high resolution nucleosome maps in paired tumour and normal tissues from the same breast cancer patients using MNase-assisted histone H3 ChIP-seq and compared them with the corresponding cfDNA from blood plasma. We detected cancer-specific single-nucleosome repositioning at key regulatory regions in a patient-specific manner, as well as common patterns across patients. The nucleosomes gained in tumour versus normal tissue were particularly informative of cancer pathways, with 20-fold enrichment at CpG islands, a large fraction of which marked promoters of genes encoding DNA-binding proteins. Tumour tissues were characterised by 5-10 bp decrease in average distances between nucleosomes (nucleosome repeat length, NRL). These effects were modulated by GC content and DNA sequence repeats and correlated with differential DNA methylation and binding of linker histone variants H1.4 and H1X. Our findings provide missing mechanistic understanding of nucleosome positioning in tumour tissues and can be valuable for nucleosomics analyses in liquid biopsies.",

Reconstructions of gene regulatory networks can reveal the information processing and control principles used by cells to maintain homeostasis and execute cell-state transitions. Here, we introduce a computational framework, D-SPIN, that generates quantitative models of generegulatory networks from single-cell mRNA-seq data sets collected across thousands of distinct perturbation conditions. D-SPIN models the cell as a collection of interacting gene-expression programs, and constructs a probabilistic model to infer regulatory interactions between gene-expression programs and external perturbations. Using large Perturb-seq and drug-response datasets, we demonstrate that D-SPIN models reveal the organization of cellular pathways, sub-functions of macromolecular complexes, and the logic of cellular regulation of transcription, translation, metabolism, and protein degradation in response to gene knockdown perturbations. D-SPIN can also be applied to dissect drug response mechanisms in heterogeneous cell populations, elucidating how combinations of immunomodulatory drugs can induce novel cell states through additive recruitment of gene expression programs. D-SPIN provides a computational framework for constructing interpretable models of gene-regulatory networks to reveal principles of cellular information processing and physiological control.",

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful scientific tool for understanding the spatial distribution of biochemical compounds in tissue structures. MSI data analysis presents problems due to the large file sizes and computational resource requirements and also due to the complexity of interpreting the raw spectral data. Dimensionality reduction techniques that address the first issue do not necessarily result in readily interpretable features. In this paper, we present non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) as a dimensionality reduction algorithm that reduces the size of MSI datasets by three orders of magnitude with limited loss of information, yielding spatial and spectral components with meaningful correlation to tissue structure. This analysis is demonstrated on an MSI dataset from female Sprague-Dawley rats for an animal model of comorbid visceral pain hypersensitivity (CPH). The significant findings are: 1) High-dimensional MSI data ([~] 100,000 ions per pixel) was reduced to 20 spectral NMF components with < 20% loss in reconstruction accuracy. 2) Spatial NMF components are reproducible and correlate well with H&E-stained tissue images. 3) Spatial NMF components may be used to provide images with enhanced specificity for different tissue types. 4) Small patches of NMF data (i.e., 20 spatial NMF components over 20 x 20 pixels) provide an accuracy of[~] 87% in classifying CPH vs nave control subjects. This paper presents novel methodologies for data augmentation to support classification, ranking of features according to their contribution to classification, and image registration to support tissue-specific imaging.",

    "abstract": "The problem of sequence identification or matching -- determining the subset of references from a given collection that are likely to contain a query nucleotide sequence -- is relevant for many important tasks in Computational Biology, such as metagenomics and pan-genome analysis. Due to the complex nature of such analyses and the large scale of the reference collections a resource-efficient solution to this problem is of utmost importance. The reference collection should therefore be pre-processed into an index for fast queries. This poses the threefold challenge of designing an index that is efficient to query, has light memory usage, and scales well to large collections.\n\nTo solve this problem, we describe how recent advancements in associative, order-preserving, k-mer dictionaries can be combined with a compressed inverted index to implement a fast and compact colored de Bruijn graph data structure. This index takes full advantage of the fact that unitigs in the colored de Bruijn graph are monochromatic (all k-mers in a unitig have the same set of references of origin, or \"color\"), leveraging the order-preserving property of its dictionary. In fact, k-mers are kept in unitig order by the dictionary, thereby allowing for the encoding of the map from k-mers to their inverted lists in as little as 1 + o(1) bits per unitig. Hence, one inverted list per unitig is stored in the index with almost no space/time overhead. By combining this property with simple but effective compression methods for inverted lists, the index achieves very small space.\n\nWe implement these methods in a tool called Fulgor. Compared to Themisto, the prior state of the art, Fulgor indexes a heterogeneous collection of 30,691 bacterial genomes in 3.8x less space, a collection of 150,000 Salmonella enterica genomes in approximately 2 x less space, is at least twice as fast for color queries, and is 2 - 6x faster to construct.\n\n2012 ACM Subject ClassificationApplied computing [-&gt;] Bioinformatics",

    "abstract": "With the advent of affordable and more accurate third generation sequencing technologies and the associated bioinformatic tools, it is now possible to sequence, assemble, and annotate more species of conservation concern than ever before. Juglans cinerea, commonly known as butternut or white walnut, is a member of the walnut family, native to the Eastern United States and Southeastern Canada. The species is currently listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List due to decline from an invasive fungus known as Ophiognomonia clavigignenti-juglandacearum (Oc-j) that causes butternut canker. Oc-j creates visible sores on the trunks of the tree which essentially starves and slowly kills the tree. Natural resistance to this pathogen is rare. Conserving butternut is of utmost priority due to its critical ecosystem role and cultural significance. As part of an integrated undergraduate and graduate student training program in biodiversity and conservation genomics, the first reference genome for Juglans cinerea is described here. This chromosome-scale 539 Mb assembly was generated from over 100X coverage of Oxford Nanopore long reads and scaffolded with the Juglans mandshurica genome. Scaffolding with a closely related species oriented and ordered the sequences in a manner more representative of the structure of the genome without altering the sequence. Comparisons with sequenced Juglandaceae revealed high levels of synteny and further supported J. cinereas recent phylogenetic placement.

    "abstract": "The green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) is a severe agricultural crop pest that has developed resistance to most current control methods, requiring the urgent development of novel strategies. Plant proteinase inhibitors (PINs) are small proteins that protect plants against pathogens and/or herbivores, likely by preventing efficient protein digestion. We identified 67 protease genes in the transcriptomes of three M. persicae lineages (USDA-Red, G002, and G006). Comparison of gene expression levels in aphid guts and whole aphids showed that several proteases, including a highly expressed serine protease, are significantly overexpressed in the guts. Furthermore, we identified three genes encoding serine protease inhibitors (SerPIN-II1, 2, and 3) in Nicotiana benthamiana, which is a non-preferred host for M. persicae. Using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) with a tobacco rattle virus (TRV) vector and overexpression with a turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) vector, we demonstrated that N. benthamiana SerPIN-II1 and SerPIN-II2 cause reduced survival and growth, but do not affect aphid protein content. Similarly, SerPIN-II3 overexpression reduced survival and growth, and serpin-II3 knockout mutations, which we generated using CRISPR/Cas9, increased survival and growth. Whereas protein content was significantly increased in aphids fed on SerPIN-II3 overexpressing plants, it was decreased in aphids fed on serpin-II3 mutants. Together, our results show that three PIN-IIs from N. benthamiana, a non-preferred host plant, effectively inhibit M. persicae survival and growth, thereby representing a new resource for the development of aphid-resistant crop plants.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining motor skills is crucial for an animals survival, enabling it to endure diverse perturbations throughout its lifespan, such as trauma, disease, and aging. What mechanisms orchestrate brain circuit reorganization and recovery to preserve the stability of behavior despite the continued presence of a disturbance? To investigate this question, we chronically silenced a fraction of inhibitory neurons in a pre-motor circuit necessary for singing in zebra finches. This manipulation altered brain activity and severely perturbed their song, a complex learned behavior, for around two months, after which it was precisely restored. Electrophysiology recordings revealed abnormal offline dynamics resulting from chronic inhibition loss, while subsequent recovery of the behavior occurred despite partial normalization of brain activity. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that chronic silencing of interneurons leads to elevated levels of microglia and MHC I. These experiments demonstrate that the adult brain can overcome extended periods of drastic abnormal activity. The reactivation of mechanisms employed during learning, including offline neuronal dynamics and upregulation of MHC I and microglia, could facilitate the recovery process following perturbation of the adult brain. These findings indicate that some forms of brain plasticity may persist in a dormant state in the adult brain until they are recruited for circuit restoration.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=173 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/541057v5_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (60K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a1a80aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f4929org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fc29fdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@28b58d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOGraphical Abstract:C_FLOATNO Schematic overview of the experiments performed in this study.\n\nTo investigate how a complex motor behavior recovers after chronic loss of inhibitory tone, we blocked the function of zebra finch HVC inhibitory neurons by bilateral stereotaxic injection of an AAV viral vector into HVC.

    "abstract": "Human neuromuscular organoids (NMOs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) hold a great potential to study (dys)functional human skeletal muscle (SkM) in vitro. The three-dimensional (3D) self-assembly of NMOs leads to the generation of spheroids, whose 3D organization cannot be controlled. Indeed, proper development, maturation and function of the innervated SkM require a well-defined multiscale 3D organization of the cells in a tissue-specific extracellular matrix (ECM) context. We hypothesized that extracellular structural imprinting along with hiPSC small-molecule-based differentiation could provide self-assembly guidance driving NMO morphogenesis and promoting the maturation and function of the human neuronal-coupled SkM in vitro models. We found that SkM ECM, provided as decellularized skeletal muscle, is able to reproducibly guide the morphogenesis of differentiating hiPSC toward multiscale structured tissue-like NMOs (t-NMOs). T-NMOs show contractile activity and possess functional neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), with mature neuromuscular system upon 30 days of hiPSC differentiation. We found that t-NMO could mimic altered muscle contraction upon administration of neurotoxins that act at NMJ level. Finally, we used hiPSCs derived from patients affected by Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) to produce DMD t-NMOs that, upon neuronal stimulation, were able to mimic the altered SkM contractility and calcium dynamics typical of the disease. Altogether, our data confirm the ability of t-NMO platform to model in vitro human neuromuscular system (patho)physiology.",

    "abstract": "The Helicobacter pylori vacuolating cytotoxin (VacA) is an intracellular, mitochondrial-targeting exotoxin that rapidly causes mitochondrial dysfunction and fragmentation. Although VacA targeting of mitochondria has been reported to alter overall cellular metabolism, there is little known about the consequences of extended exposure to the toxin. Here, we describe studies to address this gap in knowledge, which have revealed that mitochondrial dysfunction and fragmentation are followed by a time-dependent recovery of mitochondrial structure, mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and cellular ATP levels. Cells exposed to VacA also initially demonstrated a reduction in oxidative phosphorylation, as well as increase in compensatory aerobic glycolysis. These metabolic alterations were reversed in cells with limited toxin exposure, congruent with the recovery of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and the absence of cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. Taken together, these results are consistent with a model that mitochondrial structure and function are restored in VacA-intoxicated cells.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDCognitive deficits in schizophrenia are linked to dysfunctions of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), including alterations in parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons (PVIs). Redox dysregulation and oxidative stress may represent convergence points in the pathology of schizophrenia, causing dysfunction of GABAergic interneurons and loss of PV. Here, we show that the mitochondrial matrix protein cyclophilin-D (CypD), a critical initiator of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) and modulator of the intracellular redox state, is altered in PVIs in schizophrenia.\n\nMETHODSWestern blotting was used to measure CypD protein levels in postmortem DLPFC specimens of schizophrenic (n=27) and matched comparison subjects with no known history of psychiatric or neurological disorders (n=26). In a subset of this cohort, multilabel immunofluorescent confocal microscopy with unbiased stereological sampling methods were used to quantify 1) numbers of PVI across the cortical mantle (20 control, 15 schizophrenia) and 2) PV and CypD protein levels from PVIs in the cortical layers 2-4 (23 control, 19 schizophrenia).\n\nRESULTSIn schizophrenic subjects, the overall number of PVIs in the DLPFC was not significantly altered, but in individual PVIs of layers 2-4 PV protein levels decreased along a superficial-to-deep gradient when compared to unaffected comparison subjects. These laminar-specific PVI alterations were reciprocally linked to significant CypD elevations both in PVIs and within total DLPFC gray matter.\n\nCONCLUSIONSOur findings support previously reported PVI anomalies in schizophrenia and suggest that CypD-mediated mPTP formation could be a potential contributor to PVI dysfunction in schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFor optimal functionality, immune cells require a robust and adaptable metabolic program that is fueled by dynamic mitochondrial activity. In this study, we investigate the metabolic alterations occurring in immune cells during HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy by analyzing the uptake of metabolic substrates and mitochondrial homeostasis. By delineating changes in immune cell metabolic programming during HIV, we may identify novel potential therapeutic targets to improve antiviral immune responses.\n\nMethodsWhole blood was drawn from HIV uninfected female volunteers and women with chronic HIV infection on combination antiretroviral therapy. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells-derived immune cells were directly incubated with different fluorescent markers: FITC-2-NBDG (2-[N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl) amino]-2-deoxy-D-glucose), FITC-BODIPY (4,4-Difluoro-5,7-Dimethyl-4-Bora-3a,4a-Diaza-s-Indacene-3-Hexadecanoic Acid), FITC-MitoTracker Green and APC-MitoTracker Deep Red. The uptake of glucose and fats and the mitochondrial mass and potential were measured using flow cytometry. All values are reported quantitatively as geometric means of fluorescence intensity.\n\nResultsDuring chronic HIV infection, cellular uptake of glucose increases in HIV+ dendritic cells (DCs) in particular. CD4+ T cells had the lowest uptake of glucose and fats compared to all other cells regardless of HIV status, while CD8+ T cells took up more fatty acids. Interestingly, despite the lower utilization of glucose and fats in CD4+ T cells, mitochondrial mass increased in HIV+ CD4+ T cells compared to HIV negative CD4+ T-cells. HIV+ CD4+ T cells also had the highest mitochondrial potential.\n\nConclusionsSignificant disparities in the utilization of substrates by leukocytes during chronic HIV/cART exist. Innate immune cells increased utilization of sugars and fats while adaptive immune cells displayed lower glucose and fat utilization despite having a higher mitochondrial activity. Our findings suggest that cART treated HIV-infected CD4+ T cells may prefer alternative fuel sources not included in these studies. This underscores the importance of understanding the metabolic effects of HIV treatment on immune function.",

    "abstract": "To improve the early perinatal conditions of broiler chicks, alternative hatching systems have been developed. On-farm hatching (OFH) with an enriched microbial and stimulating environment by the presence of an adult hen is a promising solution. Day-old certified JA 757 chicks were allotted within different hatching and rearing conditions: OFH, conventional hatchery (CH), CH and post-hatching treatment with antibiotics (CH + AB), as well as both hatching systems with an adult hen at hatching (OFH + H, CH + H). On day (D) 27, chickens were challenged by combining transport in boxes in a new room at a lower temperature and fasting for 4 h. On their return to the original room, the chicken density was increased, and birds were orally vaccinated with the Gumboro vaccine. The impacts of these conditions on hatchability, chick quality score, performance, health and robustness were determined. The OFH chick body weights (BWs) were significantly greater than those of CH chicks at hatching. Whereas there was no effect of hatching conditions, the presence of hens, categorised according to their behaviour, decreased the hatchability rate, the quality score of OFH chicks and increased mortality at hatching. Treatment of CH chicks with antibiotics temporarily decreased chicken BW at D19, but the feed conversion ratio (FCR) was not modified. At D19, OFH chicks had the best BW compared to the other groups, and the presence of hens at hatching harmed chicken BW regardless of the hatching condition and FCR. An interaction between the effect of hatching conditions and chicken sex was observed later in BW. In males, the OFH chickens were the heaviest compared to the other groups at D34 but not at D56. The presence of hens eventually negatively impacted CH chicken BW at D56. In females, there was no effect of hatching condition on the BWs at D34 and D56, and the presence of hens eventually had a positive impact on OFH chicken BW. There was no effect of hatching conditions on health parameters. In conclusion, the OFH system was a hatching system at least equivalent to the CH system, if not better in this study. The effects of the hens presence at hatching and during the chick start-up phase on performance interacted with the hatching condition and the sex of the chickens. The health status and brooding behaviour of the hens are essential to ensure the health and welfare of the chicks.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic engineering improvement of plants will play an essential role in future agriculture, but this largely depends on the establishment of genetic transformation. Stephania tetrandra S. Moore is a traditional Chinese medicine used for rheumatalgia that accumulates benzylisoquinoline alkaloids as its main active ingredients. Wild or farmed plants have remained the main source of these essential medicines, resulting in supply pressure due to the scarcity of wild plant resources and the slow growth rate in cultivation. Here, we constructed Agrobacterium rhizogenes (C58C1)-mediated hairy root culture and a co-transformation system in S. tetrandra to obtain a new source of bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids production. We show that the biomass of the hairy roots increased by 10-fold, and the content of tetrandrine reached 8.382 {+/-} 0.160 mg/g DW after 50 days of cultivation. In addition, overexpression of (R, S)-norcoclaurine 6-O-methyltransferase (6OMT) gene or treatment of hairy roots with methyl jasmonate (MJ) increased protoberberine alkaloid content. This work provides a method of obtaining hairy roots and a genetic transformation system for S. tetrandra, not only broadening the access to S. tetrandra resources, but also laying a foundation for further elucidation of the biosynthesis of tetrandrine and related alkaloids.",

We developed a highly data-efficient model-agnostic semi-supervised meta-learning framework DESSML to address these challenges, and applied it to investigate understudied interspecies metabolite-protein interactions (MPI). Knowledge of interspecies MPIs is crucial to understand microbiome-host interactions. However, our understanding of interspecies MPIs is extremely poor due to experimental limitations. The paucity of experimental data also hampers the application of machine learning. DESSML successfully explores unlabeled data and transfers the information of intraspecies chemical-protein interactions to the interspecies MPI predictions. It achieves three times improvement in the prediction-recall over the baseline model. Using DESSML, we reveal novel MPIs that are validated by bioactivity assays and fill in missing links in microbiome-human interactions. DESSML is a general framework to explore previously unrecognized biological domains beyond the reach of present experimental techniques.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian somatic tissues around oocytes are essential for oogenesis in many metazoans. The functional ovarian somatic tissues sometimes have structural properties specific to their roles. In contrast, there is no evidence of such structural modularity of the follicle epithelium in Myriapoda, suggesting that myriapod ovarian soma may not participate in oogenesis. The ultrastructural nature of follicle cells also supports solitary oogenesis in most myriapods investigated. In contrast, here, we report two structurally and developmentally distinct domains of the follicle epithelium in the Japanese pill millipede, Hyleoglomeris japonica. The follicle epithelium of H. japonica has a thick cell mass on the apex of the follicle. These thick cells contain the rich rough endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and Goldi bodies and possess many microvilli, indicating synthetic/secretory activities, and become thicker along with the oogenetic progress. Another region of epithelium does not exhibit these features. These results show the structural and functional modularity specific to some functions of the follicle epithelium of H. japonica. Therefore, the follicle epithelium of Myriapoda is divided into 3 types: physiologically functional uniformly, nonfunctional only, and those with both. We suggest the need to reconsider the nature and roles of ovarian somatic tissues of Myriapoda and Arthropoda.",

    "abstract": "Our data previously revealed that chemosurviving cancer cells translate specific genes. Here, we find that the m6A-RNA-methyltransferase, METTL3, increases transiently in chemotherapy-treated breast cancer and leukemic cells in vitro and in vivo. Consistently, m6A increases on RNA from chemo-treated cells, and is needed for chemosurvival. This is regulated by eIF2 phosphorylation and mTOR inhibition upon therapy treatment. METTL3 mRNA purification reveals that eIF3 promotes METTL3 translation that is reduced by mutating a 5'UTR m6A-motif or depleting METTL3. METTL3 increase is transient after therapy treatment, as metabolic enzymes that control methylation and thus m6A levels on METTL3 RNA, are altered over time after therapy. Increased METTL3 reduces proliferation and anti-viral immune response genes, and enhances invasion genes, which promote tumor survival. Consistently, overriding phospho-eIF2 prevents METTL3 elevation, and reduces chemosurvival and immune-cell migration. These data reveal that therapy-induced stress signals transiently upregulate METTL3 translation, to alter gene expression for tumor survival.\n\nOne sentence summarym6A enzyme translation upon therapy stress, promotes tumor survival",

In this context, we found that the primitive endoderm alone was sufficient to regenerate a complete blastocyst and continue normal postimplantation development to term. We identify an in vitro population similar to the early primitive endoderm in vivo, that exhibits the same embryonic and extra-embryonic potency, forming three dimensional embryoid structures. Commitment in early primitive endoderm is suppressed by JAK/STAT signalling, collaborating with OCT4 to safeguard enhancer status enabling multi-lineage differentiation. Our observations support the notion that transcription factor persistence underlies plasticity in regulative development and highlights the importance of primitive endoderm in perturbed development.",

    "abstract": "The control of epidemics requires a thorough understanding of the complex interaction between pathogen transmission, disease impact and population dynamics and management. Mechanistic epidemiological modelling is an effective way to address this issue, but handling highly structured and dynamic systems, remains challenging. We therefore developed a novel approach that combines multi-level agent-based systems with spatial and temporal organization, allowing for a tuned representation of the transmission processes amongst the host population. We applied this method to model the spread of a PRRSv-like virus in pig farms, integrating the clinical consequences (conception and reproduction failures), in terms of animal husbandry practices. the results highlighted the importance to account for spatial and temporal structuring and herd management policies in epidemiological models.Indeed, disease-related abortions, inducing reassignments of sows in different batches, was shown to enhance the transmission process, favouring the persistence of the virus at the herd level. Supported by a domain-specific declarative language, our approach provides flexible and powerful solutions to address the issues of on-farm epidemics and broader public health concerns. The present application based on a simple SEIR model opens the way to the representation of more complex epidemiological systems, including more specific features such as maternally derived antibodies, vaccination, or dual infections, along with their respective clinical consequences on the management procedures.",

Efforts have been made to improve the robustness and interpretability of these models as independent challenges, however, the effect of robustness and interpretability on each other is poorly understood. Here, we show that predicting cell type based on single-cell RNA-seq data is more robust by adversarially training a deep learning model.

Compared to cells harboring the wild-type (WT) EBV genomes, Akata cells subjected to CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockdown of EBV BART 7 and BART9 showed a significant reduction in the expression of viral miRs, confirming the validity of the experimental model. Knocking down both BART7 and BART9 caused a significant reduction in cell viability and proliferation rates while increasing the expression of EBV lytic genes. Global proteomic analysis shows that knocking down EBV BART7 significantly decreased the expression of ubiquitin/proteasome proteins while increasing RNA binding proteins (RBPs). On the other hand, BART9 knockdown caused a decrease in proteins associated with oxidoreductase activity, including the metabolism of fatty acids. Our results unravel previously unknown roles for EBV miRs BART7 and BART9 on cellular pathways relevant to both viral biology and lymphomagenesis.",

Raman signals indicative for the presence of intact, i.e. non-hydrogenated polyene pigments were obtained from the fossil gastropods, thus revealing the first record of intact polyenes in fossils. The observed Raman values are in good agreement with those of unmethylated (non-carotenoid) polyenes. Fossil polyene pigments were detected in representatives of the superfamily Cerithioidea, but not in representatives of other gastropod families with colour preservation found at the same localities.

To date, most studies utilizing such models have focused exclusively on terminal time points and have likely missed critical early and late changes that are important for NAFLD progression (i.e, worsening). We performed a longitudinal analysis of histopathological, biochemical, transcriptomic, and microbiome changes that occurred in adult male mice fed either a control diet or a NASH-promoting diet (high in fat, fructose, and cholesterol) for up to 30 weeks. We observed progressive development of NAFLD in mice fed the NASH diet compared to the control diet. Differential expression of immune-related genes was observed at an early stage of diet-induced NAFLD development (10 weeks) and persisted into the later stages of the disease (20 and 30 weeks). Differential expression of xenobiotic metabolism related genes was observed at the late stage of diet-induced NAFLD development (30 weeks). Microbiome analysis revealed an increased abundance of Bacteroides at an early stage (10 weeks) that persisted into the later stages of the disease (20 and 30 weeks). These data provide insight into the progressive changes that occur during NAFLD/NASH development and progression in the context of a typical Western diet. Furthermore, these data are consistent with what has been reported in patients with NAFLD/NASH, supporting the preclinical use of this diet-induced model for development of strategies to prevent or treat the disease.",

    "abstract": "Particulate matter (PM) is a ubiquitous component of indoor and outdoor air pollution that is epidemiologically linked to many human pulmonary diseases. PM has many emission sources, making it challenging to understand the biological effects of exposure due to the high variance in chemical composition. However, the effects of compositionally unique particulate matter mixtures on cells have not been analyzed using both biophysical and biomolecular approaches. Here, we show that in a human bronchial epithelial cell model (BEAS-2B), exposure to three chemically distinct PM mixtures drives unique cell viability patterns, transcriptional remodeling, and the emergence of distinct morphological subtypes. Specifically, PM mixtures modulate cell viability and DNA damage responses and induce the remodeling of gene expression associated with cell morphology, extracellular matrix organization and structure, and cellular motility. Profiling cellular responses showed that cell morphologies change in a PM composition-dependent manner. Lastly, we observed that particulate matter mixtures with high contents of heavy metals, such as cadmium and lead, induced larger drops in viability, increased DNA damage, and drove a redistribution among morphological subtypes. Our results demonstrate that quantitative measurement of cellular morphology provides a robust approach to gauge the effects of environmental stressors on biological systems and determine cellular susceptibilities to pollution.",

    "abstract": "Genetic oscillations are generated by delayed transcriptional negative feedback loops, wherein repressor proteins inhibit their own synthesis after a temporal production delay. This delay is distributed because it arises from a sequence of noisy processes, including transcription, translation, folding, and translocation. Because the delay determines repression timing and therefore oscillation period, it has been commonly believed that delay noise weakens oscillatory dynamics. Here, we demonstrate that noisy delay can surprisingly denoise genetic oscillators. Moderate delay noise unexpectedly sharpens oscillation peaks and improves temporal peak reliability without impacting period. We show that this denoising phenomenon occurs in a variety of well-studied genetic oscillators and we use queueing theory to uncover the universal mechanisms that produce it.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWCells modulate their metabolism according to environmental conditions. A major challenge to better understand metabolic regulation is to identify, from the hundreds or thousands of molecules, the key metabolites where the re-orientation of fluxes occurs. Here, a method called ISIS (for In Silico Identification of Switches) is proposed to locate these nodes in a metabolic network, based on the analysis of a set of flux vectors (obtained e.g. by parsimonious flux balance analysis with different inputs). A metabolite is considered as a switch if the fluxes at this point are redirected in a different way when conditions change. The soundness of ISIS is shown with four case studies, using both core and genome-scale metabolic networks of Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Through these examples, we show that ISIS can identify hot-spots where fluxes are reoriented, some of these nodes corresponding to reporter metabolites identified with transcriptomic data. Additionally, switch metabolites are deeply involved in post-translational modification of proteins, showing their key role in cellular regulation. Finally, we show that Erythrose 4-phosphate is an important switch metabolite for mixotrophy in P. tricornutum, highlighting the (somehow overlooked) importance of this metabolite in the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway to orchestrate the flux variations between glycolysis, the Calvin cycle and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway when the trophic mode changes. Overall, ISIS opens up new possibilities for studying cellular metabolism and regulation, as well as potentially for developing metabolic engineering.",

We developed a computational workflow to make global cytokine-induced gene predictions from STAT phosphorylation dynamics, modeling macrophage responses to IL-6 and IL-10, which signal through common STATs, but with distinct temporal dynamics and contrasting functions. Our mechanistic-to-machine learning model identified select cytokine-induced gene sets associated with late pSTAT3 timeframes and a preferential pSTAT1 reduction upon JAK2 inhibition. We predicted and validated the impact of JAK2 inhibition on gene expression, identifying dynamically regulated genes that were sensitive or insensitive to JAK2 variation. Thus, we successfully linked STAT signaling dynamics to gene expression to support future efforts targeting pathology-associated STAT-driven gene sets. This serves as a first step in developing multi-level prediction models to understand and perturb gene expression outputs from signaling systems.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, most exciting inputs (MEIs) synthesized from encoding models of neuronal activity have become an established method to study tuning properties of biological and artificial visual systems. However, as we move up the visual hierarchy, the complexity of neuronal computations increases. Consequently, it becomes more challenging to model neuronal activity, requiring more complex models. In this study, we introduce a new attention readout for a convolutional data-driven core for neurons in macaque V4 that outperforms the state-of-the-art task-driven ResNet model in predicting neuronal responses. However, as the predictive network becomes deeper and more complex, synthesizing MEIs via straightforward gradient ascent (GA) can struggle to produce qualitatively good results and overfit to idiosyncrasies of a more complex model, potentially decreasing the MEIs model-to-brain transferability. To solve this problem, we propose a diffusion-based method for generating MEIs via Energy Guidance (EGG). We show that for models of macaque V4, EGG generates single neuron MEIs that generalize better across architectures than the state-of-the-art GA while preserving the within-architectures activation and requiring 4.7x less compute time. Furthermore, EGG diffusion can be used to generate other neurally exciting images, like most exciting natural images that are on par with a selection of highly activating natural images, or image reconstructions that generalize better across architectures. Finally, EGG is simple to implement, requires no retraining of the diffusion model, and can easily be generalized to provide other characterizations of the visual system, such as invariances. Thus EGG provides a general and flexible framework to study coding properties of the visual system in the context of natural images.1",

Using mass cytometry, we show alterations and differences in the emergence of NK cell populations and T cell memory differentiation between iHEU and iHUU. Specific NK cells observed at birth were also predictive of acellular pertussis and rotavirus vaccine-induced IgG and IgA responses, respectively, at 3 and 9 months of life. T cell receptor V{beta} clonotypic diversity was significantly and persistently lower in iHEU preceding the expansion of T cell memory.

    "abstract": "Naive T cells remain in an actively maintained state of quiescence until activation by antigenic signals, upon which they start proliferation and generation of effector cells to initiate a functional immune response. Metabolic reprogramming is essential to meet the biosynthetic demands of the differentiation process, and failure to do so can promote the development of hypofunctional exhausted T cells. Here we used 13C metabolomics and transcriptomics to study the metabolic dynamics of CD8+ T cells in their complete course of differentiation from naive over stem-like memory to effector cells. The quiescence of naive T cells was evident in a profound suppression of glucose oxidation and a decreased expression of ENO1, downstream of which no glycolytic flux was detectable. Moreover, TCA cycle activity was low in naive T cells and associated with a downregulation of SDH subunits. Upon stimulation and exit from quiescence, the initiation of cell growth and proliferation was accompanied by differential expression of T cell regulatory genes and metabolic reprogramming towards aerobic glycolysis with high rates of nutrient uptake, respiration and lactate production. High flux in anabolic pathways imposed a strain on NADH homeostasis, which coincided with engagement of the proline cycle for mitochondrial redox shuttling. With acquisition of effector functions, cells increasingly relied on glycolysis as opposed to oxidative phosphorylation, which paradoxically was not linked to changes in mitochondrial abundance. We further investigated the metabolic phenotype of exhausted T cells, finding that decreased effector function concurred with a reduction in mitochondrial metabolism, glycolysis and amino acid import, and an upregulation of suppressive and quiescence-associated genes, including TXNIP and KLF2. Thus, these results identify multiple features critical for the metabolic reprogramming that supports quiescence, proliferation and effector function of CD8+ T cells during differentiation. Further, an impairment of the same processes in exhaustion suggests that targeting these control points may be useful for both modulation of differentiation and prevention of exhaustion.",

    "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T therapies have shown remarkable efficacy in hematopoietic malignancies, but their therapeutic benefits in solid tumors have been limited due to heterogeneities in both antigen types and their expression levels on tumor cells. NK group 2 member D ligands (NKG2DLs) are extensively expressed on various tumors and absent on normal tissues, making them a promising target for cellular immunotherapy. DAP10 and DAP12 function as adaptor proteins in NK cells to transduce activating signals, and recent studies have revealed DAP10 and DAP12s additional role as a co-stimulatory signal in T cells. Our pre-clinical data showed that CAR-T targeting CLDN18.2 is highly effective in gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, but the heterogeneous expression of CLDN18.2 poses a treatment challenge. To complement this antigen deficiency, we demonstrated that NKG2DLs were extensively expressed in GI tumor tissues and formed an ideal dual target. Here, we reported a CLDN18.2 CAR design armored with synthetic NKG2D receptors (SNR) containing DAP10 and DAP12 signaling domains. This novel CAR-T showed improved cytotoxicity against tumor cells with heterogeneous expression of CLDN18.2. The possible underlined mechanism is that SNR promotes CAR-T memory formation and reduces their exhaustion, while also enhancing their expansion and ability to infiltrate immune-excluded tumors in vivo. Taken together, SNR with DAP10/12 signaling and their synergistic involvement, increased CAR-T function and overcame the antigen deficiency, providing a novel treatment modality for solid GI tumor.",

Ectoparasites have the potential to transmit vector-borne diseases of public health and veterinary importance and to play an important role in the regulation and evolution of host populations. The interlinkages between hosts, parasites and the environment are complex and challenging to study, leading to controversial results. Most previous studies have been focused on one or two parasite groups, while host are often co-infected by different taxa. The present study aims to assess the influence of environmental and host traits on the entire ectoparasite community composition of the rodent Akodon azarae. A total of 278 rodents were examined and mites (Mesostigmata), lice (Phthiraptera), ticks (Ixodida) and fleas (Siphonaptera) were determined. A Multi Correspondence Analyses was performed in order to analyse interactions within the ectoparasite community and the influence of environmental and host variables on this assembly. We found that environmental variables have a stronger influence on the composition of the ectoparasite community of A. azarae than the host variables analysed. Minimum temperature was the most influential variable among the studied. In addition, we found evidence of agonistic and antagonistic interactions between ticks and mites, lice and fleas. The present study supports the hypothesis that minimum temperature play a major role in the dynamics that shape the ectoparasite community of A. azarae, probably through both direct and indirect processes.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe vagus nerve plays an important role in neuroimmune interactions and in the regulation of inflammation. A major source of efferent vagus nerve fibers that contribute to the regulation of inflammation is the brainstem dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMN) as recently shown using optogenetics. In contrast to optogenetics, electrical neuromodulation has broad therapeutic implications, but the anti-inflammatory efficacy of electrical DMN stimulation (eDMNS) was not previously investigated. Here, we examined the effects of eDMNS on heart rate (HR) and cytokine levels in murine endotoxemia as well as the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model of sepsis.\n\nMethodsAnesthetized male 8-10-week-old C57BL/6 mice on a stereotaxic frame were subjected to eDMNS using a concentric bipolar electrode inserted into the left or right DMN or sham stimulation. eDMNS (50, 250 or 500 A and 30 Hz, for 1 min) was performed and HR recorded. In endotoxemia experiments, sham or eDMNS utilizing 250 A or 50 A was performed for 5 mins and was followed by LPS (0.5 mg/kg) i.p. administration. eDMNS was also applied in mice with cervical unilateral vagotomy or sham operation. In CLP experiments sham or left eDMNS was performed immediately post CLP. Cytokines and corticosterone were analyzed 90 mins after LPS administration or 24h after CLP. CLP survival was monitored for 14 days.\n\nResultsEither left or right eDMNS at 250 A and 500 A decreased HR, compared with pre- and post-stimulation. This effect was not observed at 50 A. Left side eDMNS at 50 A, compared with sham stimulation, significantly decreased serum and splenic levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF and increased serum levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 during endotoxemia. The anti-inflammatory effect of eDMNS was abrogated in mice with unilateral vagotomy and were not associated with serum corticosterone alterations. Right side eDMNS suppressed serum TNF levels but had no effects on serum IL-10 and on splenic cytokines. In mice with CLP, left side eDMNS suppressed serum TNF and IL-6, as well as splenic IL-6 and increased splenic IL-10 and significantly improved the survival rate of CLP mice.\n\nConclusionsFor the first time we show that a regimen of eDMNS which does not cause bradycardia alleviates LPS-induced inflammation and these effects require an intact vagus nerve and are not associated with corticosteroid alterations. eDMNS also decreases inflammation and improves survival in a model of polymicrobial sepsis. These findings are of interest for further studies exploring bioelectronic anti-inflammatory approaches targeting the brainstem DMN.",

This method was further extended with the use of trehalose (,-1,1), laminaribiose ({beta}-1,3), and cellobiose ({beta}-1,4) phosphorylases to synthesize 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-trehalose ([18F]FDT), 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-laminaribiose ([18F]FDL), and 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-cellobiose ([18F]FDC). We subsequently tested [18F]FDM and [18F]FSK in vitro, showing accumulation by several clinically relevant pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii, and demonstrated their specific uptake in vivo. The lead sakebiose-derived tracer [18F]FSK was stable in human serum and showed high uptake in preclinical models of myositis and vertebral discitis-osteomyelitis. Both the synthetic ease, and high sensitivity of [18F]FSK to S. aureus including methicillin-resistant (MRSA) strains strongly justify clinical translation of this tracer to infected patients. Furthermore, this work suggests that chemoenzymatic radiosyntheses of complex [18F]FDG-derived oligomers will afford a wide array of PET radiotracers for infectious and oncologic applications.",

    "abstract": "It has been nearly a century since the isolation and use of penicillin, heralding the discovery of a wide range of different antibiotics. In addition to clinical applications, such antibiotics have been essential laboratory tools, allowing for selection and maintenance of laboratory plasmids that encode cognate resistance genes. However, antibiotic resistance mechanisms can additionally function as public goods. For example, secretion of beta-lactamase from resistant cells, and subsequent degradation of nearby penicillin and related antibiotics, allows neighboring plasmid-free susceptible bacteria to survive antibiotic treatment. How such cooperative mechanisms impact selection of plasmids during experiments in laboratory conditions is poorly understood. Here, we show that the use of plasmid-encoded beta-lactamases leads to significant curing of plasmids in surface grown bacteria. Furthermore, such curing was also evident for aminoglycoside phosphotransferase and tetracycline antiporter resistance mechanisms. Alternatively, antibiotic selection in liquid growth led to more robust plasmid maintenance, although plasmid loss still occurred. The net outcome of such plasmid loss is the generation of a heterogenous population of plasmid-containing and plasmid-free cells, leading to experimental confounds that are not widely appreciated.\n\nImportancePlasmids are routinely used in microbiology as readouts of cell biology or tools to manipulate cell function. Central to these studies is the assumption that all cells in an experiment contain the plasmid. Plasmid maintenance in a host cell typically depends on a plasmid-encoded antibiotic resistance marker, which provides a selective advantage when the plasmid containing cell is grown in the presence of antibiotic. Here we find that growth of plasmid-containing bacteria during laboratory conditions in the presence of three distinct antibiotic families leads to the evolution of a significant number of plasmid-free cells, which rely on the resistance mechanisms of the plasmid-containing cells for viability. This process generates a heterogenous population of plasmid-free and plasmid-containing bacteria, an outcome which could confound further experimentation.",

    "abstract": "Background & AimsHuman intestinal enteroids (HIEs) are gaining recognition as physiologically relevant models of the intestinal epithelium. While HIEs from adults are used extensively in biomedical research, few studies have used HIEs from infants. Considering the dramatic developmental changes that occur during infancy, it is important to establish models that represent the infant intestinal anatomy and physiological responses.\n\nMethodsWe established jejunal HIEs from infant surgical samples and performed comparisons to jejunal HIEs from adults using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and morphologic analyses. We validated differences in key pathways through functional studies and determined if these cultures recapitulate known features of the infant intestinal epithelium.\n\nResultsRNA-Seq analysis showed significant differences in the transcriptome of infant and adult HIEs, including differences in genes and pathways associated with cell differentiation and proliferation, tissue development, lipid metabolism, innate immunity, and biological adhesion. Validating these results, we observed as higher expression of enterocytes, goblet cells and enteroendocrine cells in differentiated infant HIEs, and greater numbers of proliferative cells in undifferentiated cultures. Compared to adult HIEs, infant HIEs portray characteristics of an immature gastrointestinal epithelium including significantly shorter cell height, lower epithelial barrier integrity, and lower innate immune responses to infection with an oral poliovirus vaccine.\n\nConclusionsHIEs established from infant intestinal tissues reflect characteristics of the infant gut and are distinct from adult cultures. Our data support the use of infant HIEs as an ex-vivo model to advance studies of infant-specific diseases and drug discovery for this population.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=90 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/541350v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (17K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@68c5c9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@914ff5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@186652org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e5ac36_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Created with Biorender.com\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Resource partitioning within microbial communities is central to their incredible productivity, including over 1 gigaton of annual methane emissions through syntrophic interactions1. Here, we show how isogenic strains of a sulfate reducing bacterium (Desulfovibrio vulgaris, Dv) and a methanogen (Methanococcus maripaludis, Mm) underwent evolutionary diversification over 300-1,000 generations in a purely planktonic environmental2-4 context giving rise to coexisting ecotypes that could partition resources and improve overall stability, cooperativity, and productivity in a simulated subsurface environment. We discovered that mutations in just 15 Dv and 7 Mm genes gave rise to ecotypes within each species that were spatially enriched between sediment and planktonic phases over the course of only a few generations after transferring the evolved populations to a fluidized bed reactor (FBR). While lactate utilization by Dv in the attached community was significantly greater, the resulting H2 was partially consumed by low affinity hydrogenases in Mm within the same attached phase. The unutilized H2 was scavenged by high affinity hydrogenases in the planktonic phase Mm, generating copious amounts of methane and higher ratio of Mm to Dv. Our findings show how a handful of mutations that arise in one environmental context can drive resource partitioning by ecologically differentiated variants in another environmental context, whose interplay synergistically improves productivity of the entire mutualistic community.",

    "abstract": "Mucins are glycoproteins which can be found in host cell membranes and as a gelatinous surface formed from secreted mucins. Mucosal surfaces in mammals form a barrier to invasive microbes, particularly bacteria, but are a point of attachment for others. Clostridioides difficile is anaerobic bacterium which colonizes the mammalian GI tract and is a common cause of acute GI inflammation leading to a variety of negative outcomes. Although C. difficile toxicity stems from secreted toxins, colonization is a prerequisite for C. difficile disease. While C. difficile is known to associate with the mucus layer and underlying epithelium, the mechanisms underlying these interactions that facilitate colonization are less well-understood. To understand the molecular mechanisms by which C. difficile interacts with mucins, we used ex vivo mucosal surfaces to test the ability of C. difficile to bind to mucins from different mammalian tissues. We found significant differences in C. difficile adhesion based upon the source of mucins, with highest levels of binding observed to mucins purified from the human colonic adenocarcinoma line LS174T and lowest levels of binding to porcine gastric mucin. We also observed that defects in adhesion by mutants deficient in flagella, but not type IV pili. These results imply that interactions between host mucins and C. difficile flagella facilitate the initial host attachment of C. difficile to host cells and secreted mucus.",

    "abstract": "The C-terminal Binding Protein (CtBP) is a transcriptional corepressor that plays critical roles in development, tumorigenesis, and cell fate. CtBP proteins are structurally similar to alpha hydroxyacid dehydrogenases and additionally feature an unstructured C-terminal domain (CTD). The role of a possible dehydrogenase activity has been postulated for the corepressor, although in vivo substrates are unknown, but the functional significance of the CTD is unclear. In the mammalian system, CtBP proteins lacking the CTD are able to function as transcriptional regulators and oligomerize, putting into question the significance of the CTD for gene regulation. Yet, the presence of an unstructured CTD of [~]100 residues, including some short motifs, is conserved across Bilateria, indicating the importance of this domain. To study the in vivo functional significance of the CTD, we turned to the Drosophila melanogaster system, which naturally expresses isoforms with the CTD (CtBP(L)), and isoforms lacking the CTD (CtBP(S)). We used the CRISPRi system to test dCas9-CtBP(S) and dCas9-CtBP(L) on diverse endogenous genes, to directly compare their transcriptional impacts in vivo. Interestingly, CtBP(S) was able to significantly repress transcription of the E2F2 and Mpp6 genes, while CtBP(L) had minimal impact, suggesting that the long CTD modulates CtBPs repression activity. In contrast, in cell culture, the isoforms behaved similarly on a transfected Mpp6 reporter. Thus, we have identified context-specific effects of these two developmentally-regulated isoforms, and propose that differential expression of CtBP(S) and CtBP(L) may provide a spectrum of repression activity suitable for developmental programs.",

    "abstract": "During daily walking, humans might contend with various perturbations from slippery surfaces in the winter to uneven sidewalks in the summer. Inertial sensors enable investigations of how humans maintain balance under these natural conditions, but conducting these outdoor studies has practical considerations that might influence study results, such as the selection of footwear under different weather conditions. Our study investigates the effects of winter and summer shoe types on gait patterns, specifically whether different shoe types induce changes in gait stability measures under the same walking environment. Twelve healthy adult participants walked indoors with winter and summer shoes while their gait kinematics were recorded using an inertial sensor-based motion capture system. Spatiotemporal measures, body kinematics, stability measures (minimum margin of stability and local divergence exponent), and stepping regressions were calculated to evaluate differences between walking in summer and winter shoes. Statistical significance was determined by paired t-tests. Varying shoe types altered spatiotemporal and kinematic measures, such as increased stride time and stance time while wearing winter shoes, but increased step width and reliance on stepping were the only stability-related changes found. Our study provides insights into the influence of footwear for inertial sensor-based gait studies in real environments, aiding the analysis and interpretation of those studies to augment our understanding of natural stability behavior.",

    "abstract": "Overexpression of repetitive elements is an emerging hallmark of human cancers1. Diverse repeats can mimic viruses by replicating within the cancer genome through retrotransposition, or presenting pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune system2-5. Yet, how specific repeats affect tumor evolution and shape the tumor immune microenvironment (TME) in a pro- or anti-tumorigenic manner remains poorly defined. Here, we integrate whole genome and total transcriptome data from a unique autopsy cohort of multiregional samples collected in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients, into a comprehensive evolutionary analysis. We find that more recently evolved Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements (SINE), a family of retrotransposable repeats, are more likely to form immunostimulatory double-strand RNAs (dsRNAs). Consequently, younger SINEs are strongly co-regulated with RIG-I like receptor associated type-I interferon genes but anti-correlated with pro-tumorigenic macrophage infiltration. We discover that immunostimulatory SINE expression in tumors is regulated by either Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements 1 (LINE1/L1) mobility or ADAR1 activity in a TP53 mutation dependent manner. Moreover, L1 retrotransposition activity tracks with tumor evolution and is associated with TP53 mutation status. Altogether, our results suggest pancreatic tumors actively evolve to modulate immunogenic SINE stress and induce pro-tumorigenic inflammation. Our integrative, evolutionary analysis therefore illustrates, for the first time, how dark matter genomic repeats enable tumors to co-evolve with the TME by actively regulating viral mimicry to their selective advantage.",

Agricultural cultivation can currently supply the demand for the BIAs that accumulate in plants, but broader access to the entire BIA family would open new avenues of research and commercialization. Microbial synthesis presents an attractive option due to cheap feedstock, genetic tractability, and ease of scale-up. Previously we reported titers of the key branch-point BIA (S)-reticuline of 4.6 g/L in yeast, which was achieved through leveraging the Ehrlich pathway 2-oxoacid decarboxylase Aro10 to generate the intermediate 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (4-HPAA). Here, we establish a superior route to (S)-reticuline by switching the pathway intermediate from 4-HPAA to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (3,4-dHPAA) using human monoamine oxidase A (MAO). The resulting (S)-norlaudanosoline route to (S)-reticuline synthesis is more selective, resolving prior issues with off-pathway THIQs synthesized due to concerted enzyme promiscuity. The new pathway is also more efficient, enabling titers of 4.8 g/L (S)-reticuline while improving yields over 40%, from 17 mg/g sucrose to 24 mg/g sucrose in fed-batch fermentations.

To date, synNotch has been used to program therapeutic cells and pattern morphogenesis in multicellular systems. However, cell-presented ligands have limited versatility for applications that require spatial precision, such as tissue engineering. To address this, we developed a suite of materials to activate synNotch receptors and serve as generalizable platforms for generating user-defined material-to-cell signaling pathways. First, we demonstrate that synNotch ligands, such as GFP, can be conjugated to cell- generated ECM proteins via genetic engineering of fibronectin produced by fibroblasts. We then used enzymatic or click chemistry to covalently link synNotch ligands to gelatin polymers to activate synNotch receptors in cells grown on or within a hydrogel. To achieve microscale control over synNotch activation in cell monolayers, we microcontact printed synNotch ligands onto a surface. We also patterned tissues comprising cells with up to three distinct phenotypes by engineering cells with two distinct synthetic pathways and culturing them on surfaces microfluidically patterned with two synNotch ligands.\n\nWe showcase this technology by co-transdifferentiating fibroblasts into skeletal muscle or endothelial cell precursors in user-defined spatial patterns towards the engineering of muscle tissue with prescribed vascular networks. Collectively, this suite of approaches extends the synNotch toolkit and provides novel avenues for spatially controlling cellular phenotypes in mammalian multicellular systems, with many broad applications in developmental biology, synthetic morphogenesis, human tissue modeling, and regenerative medicine.",

We show here that a prior experience of swarming is remembered when E. coli encounters a new surface, improving its future swarming efficiency. We conducted >10,000 single-cell swarm assays to discover that cells store memory in the form of cellular iron levels. This memory pre-exists in planktonic cells, but the act of swarming reinforces it. A cell with low iron initiates swarming early and is a better swarmer, while the opposite is true for a cell with high iron. The swarming potential of a mother cell, whether low or high, is passed down to its fourth-generation daughter cells. This memory is naturally lost by the seventh generation, but artificially manipulating iron levels allows it to persist much longer. A mathematical model with a time-delay component faithfully recreates the observed dynamic interconversions between different swarming potentials. We also demonstrate that iron memory can integrate multiple stimuli, impacting other bacterial behaviors such as biofilm formation and antibiotic tolerance.",

We studied bacterial isolates from the Harvard Forest Long-Term Ecological Research site, where field soils have been experimentally heated to 5{degrees}C above ambient temperature with unheated controls for thirty years. We hypothesized that Alphaproteobacteria from warmed plots have (1) less temperature sensitive growth rates; (2) higher optimum growth temperatures; and (3) higher maximum growth temperatures compared to isolates from control plots. We made high-throughput measurements of bacterial growth in liquid cultures over time and across temperatures from 22-37{degrees}C in 2-3{degrees}C increments. We estimated growth rates by fitting Gompertz models to the growth data. Temperature sensitivity of growth rate, optimum growth temperature, and maximum growth temperature were estimated by the Ratkowsky 1983 model and a modified Macromolecular Rate Theory (MMRT) model. To determine evidence of adaptation, we ran phylogenetic generalized least squares tests on isolates from warmed and control soils. Our results showed evidence of adaptation of higher optimum growth temperature of bacterial isolates from heated soils. However, we observed no evidence of adaptation of temperature sensitivity of growth and maximum growth temperature. Our project begins to capture the shape of the temperature response curves, but illustrates that the relationship between growth and temperature is complex and cannot be limited to a single point in the biokinetic range.\n\nImportanceSoils are the largest terrestrial carbon sink and the foundation of our food, fiber, and fuel systems. Healthy soils are carbon sinks, storing more carbon than they release. This reduces the amount of carbon dioxide released to the atmosphere and buffers against climate change. Soil microbes drive biogeochemical cycling and contribute to soil health through organic matter breakdown, plant growth promotion, and nutrient distribution. In this study, we determined how soil microbial growth traits respond to long-term soil warming. We found that bacterial isolates from warmed plots showed evidence of adaptation of increased optimum growth temperature. This suggests that increased microbial biomass and growth relative to respiration in a warming world should result in greater carbon storage. As temperatures increase, greater microbial activity may help reduce the soil carbon feedback loop. Our results provide insight on how atmospheric carbon cycling and soil health may respond in a warming world.",

    "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile (CD) is a sporulating and toxin-producing nosocomial pathogen that opportunistically infects the gut, particularly in patients with depleted microbiota after antibiotic exposure. Metabolically, CD rapidly generates energy and substrates for growth from Stickland fermentations of amino acids, with proline being a preferred reductive substrate. To investigate the in vivo effects of reductive proline metabolism on C. difficiles virulence in an enriched gut nutrient environment, we evaluated wild-type and isogenic{Delta} prdB strains of ATCC43255 on pathogen behaviors and host outcomes in highly susceptible gnotobiotic mice. Mice infected with the{Delta} prdB mutant demonstrated extended survival via delayed colonization, growth and toxin production but ultimately succumbed to disease. In vivo transcriptomic analyses demonstrated how the absence of proline reductase activity more broadly disrupted the pathogens metabolism including failure to recruit oxidative Stickland pathways, ornithine transformations to alanine, and additional pathways generating growth-promoting substrates, contributing to delayed growth, sporulation, and toxin production. Our findings illustrate the central role for proline reductase metabolism to support early stages of C. difficile colonization and subsequent impact on the pathogens ability to rapidly expand and cause disease.",

    "abstract": "The expansion of GGGGCC (G4C2) repeats in the noncoding region of C9orf72 is the most common genetic cause of familial and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The repeat region is translated into five different dipeptide repeats (DPRs), of which the arginine-rich DPRs (R-DPRs) poly-GR (GRn) and poly-PR (PRn) are highly neurotoxic and are probably primarily responsible for the disease. Here, we characterized the protective effect against R-DPR toxicity of polystyrene sulfonate (PSS), an FDA-approved drug applied in hyperkalemia, in biochemical, cellular, and animal models of ALS/FTD. We found that PSS, in a length-dependent manner, interacts very tightly with R-DPRs, and releases their bound RNA in R-DPR - RNA mixtures. PSS significantly influences the liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of R-DPRs elicited by RNA and reduces their ensuing cell toxicity in Neuro2a cells. PSS is cell penetrable, and it is also effective in countering the toxicity of R-DPRs in zebrafish embryos. Except for the longest (n = 340) variant, PSS is toxic neither to cells nor to mice upon intracerebroventricular injection up to 1 mM concentration. Our results suggest that its polymeric nature endows PSS with an advantageous effect in C9-ALS/FTD and offers a possible remedy against this debilitating neurodegenerative disease.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been demonstrated to modulate life span in the invertebrates C. elegans and Drosophila by targeting conserved pathways of aging, such as insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS). However, a role for miRNAs in modulating human longevity has not been fully explored. Here we investigated novel roles of miRNAs as a major epigenetic component of exceptional longevity in humans. By profiling the miRNAs in B-cells from Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians and 70-year-old controls without a longevity history, we found that the majority of differentially expressed miRNAs were upregulated in centenarians and predicted to modulate the IIS pathway. Notably, decreased IIS activity was found in B cells from centenarians who harbored these upregulated miRNAs. miR-142-3p, the top upregulated miRNA, was verified to dampen the IIS pathway by targeting multiple genes including GNB2, AKT1S1, RHEB and FURIN. Overexpression of miR-142-3p improved the stress resistance under genotoxicity and induced the impairment of cell cycle progression in IMR90 cells. Furthermore, mice injected with a miR-142-3p mimic showed reduced IIS signaling and improved longevity-associated phenotypes including enhanced stress resistance, improved diet/aging-induced glucose intolerance, and longevity-associated change of metabolic profile. These data suggest that miR-142-3p is involved in human longevity through regulating IIS-mediated pro-longevity effects. This study provides strong support for the use of miR-142-3p as a novel therapeutic to promote longevity or prevent aging/aging-related diseases in human.",

However, the full spectrum of TNF--modulated epitranscriptomic m6A marks is unknown. We employed a genomewide approach to examine the extent of m6A RNA modifications under TNF--modulated apoptotic conditions in HeLa cells. miCLIP-seq analyses revealed a plethora of m6A marks on 632 target mRNAs with an enrichment on 99 mRNAs associated with apoptosis. Interestingly, the m6A RNA modification patterns were quite different under cisplatin- and TNF--mediated apoptotic conditions. We then examined the abundance and translational efficiencies of several mRNAs under METTL3 knockdown and/or TNF- treatment conditions. Our analyses showed changes in the translational efficiency of TP53INP1 mRNA based on the polysome profile analyses. Additionally, TP53INP1 protein amount was modulated by METTL3 knockdown upon TNF- treatment but not CP treatment, suggesting the existence of a pathway-specific METTL3-TP53INP1 axis. Congruently, METLL3 knockdown sensitized HeLa cells to TNF--mediated apoptosis, which was also validated in a zebrafish larval xenograft model. These results suggest that apoptotic pathway-specific m6A methylation marks exist in cells and TNF--METTL3-TP53INP1 axis modulates TNF--mediated apoptosis in HeLa cells.",

    "abstract": "In the Polarity/Protusion model of growth cone migration away from the guidance cue UNC-6/Netrin, the UNC-5 receptor polarizes the VD growth cone such that filopodial protrusions are biased to the dorsal leading edge of the growth cone. UNC-5 also inhibits growth cone protrusion ventrally based upon this polarity. The SRC-1 tyrosine kinase has been previously shown to physically interact with and phosphorylate UNC-5, and to act with UNC-5 in axon guidance and cell migration. Here, the role of SRC-1 in VD growth cone polarity and protrusion is investigated. A precise deletion of src-1 was generated, and mutants displayed unpolarized growth cones with increased size, similar to unc-5 mutants. Transgenic expression of src-1(+) in VD/DD neurons resulted in smaller growth cones, and rescued growth cone polarity defects of src-1 mutants, indicating cell-autonomous function. Transgenic expression of a putative kinase-dead src-1(D831A) mutant caused a phenotype similar to src-1 loss-of-function, suggesting that this is a dominant negative mutation. The D381A mutation was introduced into the endogenous src-1 gene by genome editing, which also had a dominant-negative effect. Genetic interactions of src-1 and unc-5 suggest they act in the same pathway on growth cone polarity and protrusion, but might have overlapping, parallel functions in other aspects of axon guidance. src-1 function was not required for the effects of activated myr::unc-5, suggesting that SRC-1 might be involved in UNC-5 dimerization and activation by UNC-6, of which myr::unc-5 is independent. In sum, these results show that SRC-1 acts with UNC-5 in growth cone polarity and inhibition of protrusion.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenome-wide association studies have revealed an association between the genetic variant rs17514846 on chromosome 15q26.1 and coronary artery disease susceptibility. Studies have shown that rs17514846 influences the expression of the FES Upstream Region (FURIN) gene located at this locus in monocytes. We investigated the mechanism through which rs17514846 modulates FURIN expression.\n\nMethods and ResultsAn analysis of isogenic monocytic cell lines with either the rs17514846 C/C or A/A genotype showed that the cells of the A/A genotype expressed higher levels of FURIN than cells of the C/C genotype. A pyrosequencing methylation analysis showed that the cytosine (in a CpG motif) at the rs17514846 position on the C allele was methylated. Treatment with the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine increased FURIN expression. A bioinformatic analysis indicated that the rs17514846 site might interact with the transcription factor MeCP2 that often functions as a gene repressor by binding to methylated CpG sites. An electrophoretic mobility super-shift assay with a probe corresponding to the DNA sequence at and around the rs17514846 position of the C allele detected two DNA-protein complex bands, which were altered by the addition of an anti-MeCP2 antibody in the assay, whilst these DNA-protein complexes were barely detectable with a probe for the A allele. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed an enrichment of the DNA sequence containing the rs17514846 site in chromatin precipitates pulled down by an anti-MeCP2 antibody. siRNA-mediated knockdown of MeCP2 caused an increase in FURIN expression. Furthermore, MeCP2 knockdown increased monocyte migration and proliferation, and this effect was diminished by a FURIN inhibitor.\n\nConclusionsThe results of our study suggest that DNA methylation inhibits FURIN expression and that the coronary artery disease predisposing variant rs17514846 modulates FURIN expression and monocyte migration via an allele-specific effect on DNA methylation.",

    "abstract": "The folding of RNA and protein molecules during their synthesis is a crucial self-assembly process that nature employs to convert genetic information into the complex molecular machinery that supports life. Misfolding events are the cause of several diseases, and the folding pathway of central biomolecules, such as the ribosome, is strictly regulated by programmed maturation processes and folding chaperones. However, the dynamic folding processes are challenging to study because current structure determination methods heavily rely on averaging, and existing computational methods do not efficiently simulate non-equilibrium dynamics. Here we utilize individual-particle cryo-electron tomography (IPET) to investigate the folding landscape of a rationally designed RNA origami 6-helix bundle that undergoes slow maturation from a \"young\" to \"mature\" conformation. By optimizing the IPET imaging and electron dose conditions, we obtain 3D reconstructions of 120 individual particles at resolutions ranging from 23-35 [A], enabling us first-time to observe individual RNA helices and tertiary structures without averaging. Statistical analysis of 120 tertiary structures confirms the two main conformations and suggests a possible folding pathway driven by helix-helix compaction. Studies of the full conformational landscape reveal both trapped states, misfolded states, intermediate states, and fully compacted states. The study provides novel insight into RNA folding pathways and paves the way for future studies of the energy landscape of molecular machines and self-assembly processes.",

    "abstract": "The phase separation model for transcription suggests that transcription factors (TFs), coactivators, and RNA polymerases form biomolecular condensates around active gene loci and regulate transcription. However, the structural details of condensates remain elusive. In this study, for Nanog, a master TF in mammalian embryonic stem cells known to form protein condensates in vitro, we examined protein structures in the condensates using residue-level coarse-grained molecular simulations. Human Nanog formed micelle-like clusters in the condensate. In the micelle-like cluster, the C-terminal disordered domains, including the tryptophan repeat (WR) regions, interacted with each other near the cluster center primarily via hydrophobic interaction. In contrast, hydrophilic disordered N-terminal and DNA-binding domains were exposed on the surface of the clusters. Electrostatic attractions of these surface residues were responsible for bridging multiple micelle-like structures in the condensate. The micelle-like structure and condensate were dynamic and liquid-like. Mutation of tryptophan residues in the WR region which was implicated to be important for a Nanog function resulted in dissolution of the Nanog condensate. Finally, to examine the impact of Nanog cluster to DNA, we added DNA fragments to the Nanog condensate. Nanog DNA-binding domains exposed to the surface of the micelle-like cluster could recruit more than one DNA fragments, making DNA-DNA distance shorter.\n\nAuthor summaryIn eukaryotic transcription regulation, enhancer elements far from the promoter are known to modulate transcriptional activity, but the molecular mechanism remains elusive. One of these models, the phase separation model, suggests that transcription factors (TFs), coactivators, and transcription machinery form biomolecular condensates that include enhancer and promoter elements, making enhancer-promoter communication possible via the protein network in the condensate. Nanog, one of the core TFs involved in mammalian embryonic stem cells, has been reported to have the ability to form condensates. In this study, we addressed the structural details of Nanog condensates by performing residue-level coarse-grained molecular simulations. We found that Nanog formed micelle-like clusters via primarily hydrophobic interactions between tryptophan repeat regions in the C-terminal disordered domains within the condensate. On the other hand, highly charged N-terminal and DNA-binding domains were exposed to the surface of the micelle and were responsible for bridging many micelles into a condensate. The micelle-like clusters and condensate were dynamic and liquid-like. In addition, Nanog condensates could induce DNA-DNA attraction mediated by micelle-like structures.",

We constructed a collection of genetic parts consisting of 22 origins of replication (ORIs), 20 antibiotic selectable markers, and 30 molecular barcodes, which can be assembled combinatorially to create a library of plasmids trackable by next-generation DNA sequencing. We demonstrate our approach by delivering a pooled library of 22 ORIs to 12 bacterial species including extremophiles, electroactive bacteria and bioproduction strains. We report, for the first time, DNA delivery by conjugation and functional ORIs for Halomonas alkaliphila, Halomonas neptunia, and Shewanella electrodiphila. Furthermore, we expand the list of functional ORIs for Duganella zoogloeoides, Pseudomonas alcaliphila, Shewanella oneidensis and Shewanella putrefaciens.

    "abstract": "The laboratory rat emerges as a useful tool for studying the interaction between the host and its microbiome. To advance principles relevant to the human microbiome, we systematically investigated and defined a multi-tissue full lifespan microbial biogeography for healthy Fischer 344 rats. Microbial community profiling data was extracted and integrated with host transcriptomic data from the Sequencing Quality Control (SEQC) consortium. Unsupervised machine learning, Spearmans correlation, taxonomic diversity, and abundance analyses were performed to determine and characterize the rat microbial biogeography and the identification of four inter-tissue microbial heterogeneity patterns (P1-P4). The 11 body habitats harbor a greater diversity of microbes than previously suspected. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) abundances progressively declined in lungs from breastfeed newborn to adolescence/adult and was below detectable levels in elderly rats. LABs presence and levels in lungs were further evaluated by PCR in the two validation datasets. The lung, testes, thymus, kidney, adrenal, and muscle niches were found to have age-dependent alterations in microbial abundance. P1 is dominated by lung samples. P2 contains the largest sample size and is enriched for environmental species. Liver and muscle samples were mostly classified into P3. Archaea species were exclusively enriched in P4. The 357 pattern-specific microbial signatures were positively correlated with host genes in cell migration and proliferation (P1), DNA damage repair and synaptic transmissions (P2), as well as DNA transcription and cell cycle in P3. Our study established a link between metabolic properties of LAB with lung microbiota maturation and development. Breastfeeding and environmental exposure influence microbiome composition and host health and longevity. The inferred rat microbial biogeography and pattern-specific microbial signatures would be useful for microbiome therapeutic approaches to human health and good quality of life.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=113 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/541527v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1387224org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cdb7dborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e1c7ccorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@440ca_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Environmental microorganisms have evolved a variety of strategies to survive fluctuations in environmental conditions, including production of biofilms and differentiation into spores. Myxococcus xanthus are ubiquitous soil bacteria that produce starvation-induced multicellular fruiting bodies filled with environmentally resistant spores (a specialized biofilm). Fruiting bodies are thought to facilitate the M. xanthus social life cycle by ensuring spores can germinate en masse into a productive feeding community. Isolated spores have been shown to be more resistant than vegetative cells to heat, ultraviolet radiation, and desiccation, but it is unknown whether assembly of spores into a fruiting body provides additional protection from environmental insults. We developed a high-throughput method to compare the recovery (outgrowth) of distinct cell types (vegetative cells, free spores, and intact fruiting bodies) after exposure to ultraviolet radiation or desiccation. Our data indicate haystack-shaped fruiting bodies protect spores from extended UV radiation but do not provide additional protection from desiccation. Perturbation of fruiting body morphology strongly impedes recovery from both UV exposure and desiccation. These results hint that the distinctive fruiting bodies produced by different myxobacterial species may have evolved to optimize their persistence in distinct ecological niches.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe myxobacteria are environmentally ubiquitous social bacteria that influence the local microbial community composition. Understanding how these bacteria are affected by environmental insults is important in predicting how microbial biogeochemical cycling is affected by climate change. When starved, myxobacteria produce multicellular fruiting bodies filled with spores. As spores are resistant to a variety of environmental insults, it has long been held that the fruiting body evolved to ensure group germination into a productive feeding community. Using the model myxobacterium, Myxococcus xanthus, we demonstrate that the haystack-shaped fruiting body morphology enables significantly more resistance to UV exposure than the free spores. In contrast, fruiting bodies are slightly detrimental to recovery from extended desiccation, an effect that is strongly exaggerated if fruiting body morphology is perturbed. These results suggest the variety of fruiting body morphologies observed in the myxobacteria may dictate their relative resistance to changing climate conditions.",

    "abstract": "Coccidian protozoa from the genus Eimeria are widespread parasites of vertebrates, causing serious disease (coccidiosis) and economic loss most notably in poultry. Several species of Eimeria are themselves infected with small RNA viruses assigned to the family Totiviridae. In this study, the sequences of two such viruses were newly determined, one of which represents the first complete protein-coding sequence of a virus from E. necatrix, an important pathogen of chickens, and the other of which is from E. stiedai, an important pathogen of rabbits. Sequence features of the newly identified viruses, compared with those of ones reported previously, provide several insights. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that these eimerian viruses constitute a well-demarcated clade, probably deserving of recognition as a distinct genus.",

    "abstract": "miR-675 is a microRNA expressed from exon 1 of H19 long non-coding RNA. H19 lncRNA is temporally expressed in humans and atypical expression of miR-675 has been linked with several diseases and disorders. To execute its function inside the cell, miR-675 is folded into a particular conformation which aids in its interaction with several other biological molecules. However, the exact folding dynamics of miR-675 and its complete interaction map are currently unknown. Moreover, how H19 lncRNA and miR-675 crosstalk and modulate each others activities is also unclear. Detailed structural analysis of miR-675 in this study determines its conformation and identifies novel protein binding sites on miR-675 which can make it an excellent therapeutic target against numerous diseases. Mapping of the interactome identified some of known and unknown interactors of miR-675 which aid in expanding our repertoire of miR-675 involved pathways in the cell. This analysis also identified some of the previously unknown and yet to be characterised proteins as probable interactors of miR-675. Structural and base pair conservation analysis between H19 lncRNA and miR-675 results in structural transformations in miR-675 thus describing the earlier unknown mechanism of interaction between these two molecules. Comprehensively, this study details the conformation of miR-675, its interacting biological partners and explains its relationship with H19 lncRNA which can be interpreted to understand the role of miR-675 in the development and progression of various diseases.",

    "abstract": "The remarkable potential of human endometrium to undergo spontaneous remodeling is shaped by controlled spatiotemporal gene expression patterns. Although hormone-driven transcription shown to govern these patterns, the post-transcriptional processing of these mRNA transcripts, including the mRNA splicing in the endometrium is not studied yet. Here, we report that the splicing factor, SF3B1 is central in driving alternative splicing (AS) events that are vital for physiological responses of the endometrium. We show that loss of SF3B1 splicing activity impairs stromal cell decidualization as well as embryo implantation. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that SF3B1 depletion decidualizing stromal cells led to differential mRNA splicing. Specifically, a significant upregulation in mutually exclusive AS events (MXEs) with SF3B1 loss resulted in the generation of aberrant transcripts. Further, we found that some of these candidate genes phenocopy SF3B1 function in decidualization. Importantly, we identify progesterone as a potential upstream regulator of SF3B1-mediated functions in endometrium possibly via maintaining its persistently high levels, in coordination with deubiquitinating enzymes. Collectively, our data suggest that SF3B1-driven alternative splicing plays a critical role in mediating the endometrial-specific transcriptional paradigms. Thus, the identification of novel mRNA variants associated with successful pregnancy establishment may help to develop new strategies to diagnose or prevent early pregnancy loss.",

    "abstract": "Protein engineering has nearly limitless applications across chemistry, energy, and medicine, but creating new proteins with improved or novel functions remains slow, labor-intensive, and inefficient. In this work, we present the Self-driving Autonomous Machines for Protein Landscape Exploration (SAMPLE) platform for fully autonomous protein engineering. SAMPLE is driven by an intelligent agent that learns protein sequence-function relationships, designs new proteins, and sends designs to a fully automated robotic system that experimentally tests designed proteins and provides feedback to improve the agents understanding of the system. We deployed four SAMPLE agents with the goal of engineering glycoside hydrolase enzymes with enhanced thermal tolerance. Despite showing individual differences in their search behavior, all four agents quickly converged on thermostable enzymes that were at least 12 {degrees}C more stable than the starting sequences. Self-driving laboratories automate and accelerate the scientific discovery process and hold great potential for the fields of protein engineering and synthetic biology.",
