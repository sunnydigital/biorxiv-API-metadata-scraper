    "abstract": "Zebrafish are an increasingly popular model to study spinal cord injury (SCI) regeneration. The transparency of larval zebrafish makes them ideal to study cellular processes in real time. Standardized approaches, including age of injury, are not readily available making comparisons of the results with other models challenging. In this study, we systematically examined the response to spinal cord transection of larval zebrafish at three different ages (3-7 days post fertilization or dpf) to determine whether the developmental complexity of the central nervous system affects the overall response to SCI. We then used imaging and behavioral analysis to evaluate whether differences existed based on the age of injury. All ages of larval zebrafish upregulated the required genes for glial bridge formation, ctgfa and gfap, at the site of injury, consistent with studies from adult zebrafish. Though all larval ages upregulated factors required to promote glial bridging, young larval zebrafish (3 dpf) were better able to regenerate axons independent of the glial bridge, unlike older zebrafish (7 dpf). Consistent with this data, locomotor experiments demonstrated that some swimming behavior occurs independent of glial bridge formation, further highlighting the need for standardization of this model and recovery assays. Overall, we found subtle cellular differences based on the age of transection in zebrafish, underlining the importance of considering age when designing experiments aimed at understanding regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Alanyl-transfer RNA synthetase 2 (AARS2) is a nuclear encoded mitochondrial tRNA synthetase that is responsible for charging of tRNA-Ala with alanine during mitochondrial translation. Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the Aars2 gene, including those affecting its splicing, are linked to infantile cardiomyopathy in humans. However, how Aars2 regulates heart development, and the underlying molecular mechanism of heart disease remains unknown. Here, we found that poly(rC) binding protein 1 (PCBP1) interacts with the Aars2 transcript to mediate its alternative splicing and is critical for the expression and function of Aars2. Cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of Pcbp1 in mice resulted in defects in heart development that are reminiscent of human congenital cardiac defects, including noncompaction cardiomyopathy and a disruption of the cardiomyocyte maturation trajectory. Loss of Pcbp1 led to an aberrant alternative splicing and a premature termination of Aars2 in cardiomyocytes. Additionally, Aars2 mutant mice with exon-16 skipping recapitulated heart developmental defects observed in Pcbp1 mutant mice. Mechanistically, we found dysregulated gene and protein expression of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway in both Pcbp1 and Aars2 mutant hearts; these date provide further evidence that the infantile hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated with the disorder oxidative phosphorylation defect type 8 (COXPD8) is mediated by Aars2. Our study therefore identifies Pcbp1 and Aars2 as critical regulators of heart development and provides important molecular insights into the role of disruptions in metabolism on congenital heart defects.",

    "abstract": "Computational models are becoming an increasingly valuable tool in biomedical research. They enable the quantification of variables difficult to measure experimentally, an increase in the spatio-temporal resolution of the experiments and the testing of hypotheses.\n\nParameter estimation from in-vitro data, remains a challenge, due to the limited availability of experimental datasets acquired in directly comparable conditions. While the use of computational models to supplement laboratory results contributes to this issue, a more extensive analysis of the effect of incomplete or inaccurate data on the parameter optimization process and its results is warranted. To this end, we compared the results obtained from the same in-silico model of ovarian cancer cell growth and metastasis, calibrated with datasets acquired from two different experimental settings: a traditional 2D monolayer, and 3D cell culture models.\n\nThe differential behaviour of these models will inform the role and importance of experimental data in the calibration of computational models calibration. This work will also provide a set of general guidelines for the comparative testing and selection of experimental models and protocols to be used for parameter optimization in computational models\n\nAuthor summaryParameter identification is a key step in the development of a computational model, that is used to establish a connection between the simulated and experimental results and verify the accuracy of the in-silico framework.\n\nThe selection of the in-vitro data to be used in this phase is fundamental, but little attention has been paid to the role of the experimental model in this process. To bridge this gap we present a comparative analysis of the same computational model calibrated using experimental data acquired from cells cultured (i) in 2D monolayers, (ii) in 3D culture models and (iii) a combination of the two.\n\nData acquired in different experimental settings induce changes in the optimal parameter sets and the corresponding computational models behaviour. This translates in a varying degree of accuracy during the validation procedure, when the simulated data are compared to experimental measurements not used during the calibration step.\n\nOverall, our work provides a workflow and a set of guidelines to select the most appropriate experimental setting for the calibration and validation of computational models.",
