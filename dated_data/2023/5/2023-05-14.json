    "abstract": "SPOP is a Cul3 substrate adaptor responsible for degradation of many proteins related to cell growth and proliferation. Because mutation or misregulation of SPOP drives cancer progression, understanding the suite of SPOP substrates is important to understanding regulation of cell proliferation. Here, we identify Nup153, a component of the nuclear basket of the nuclear pore complex, as a novel substrate of SPOP. SPOP and Nup153 bind to each other and colocalize at the nuclear envelope and some nuclear foci in cells. The binding interaction between SPOP and Nup153 is complex and multivalent. Nup153 is ubiquitylated and degraded upon expression of SPOPWT but not its substrate binding-deficient mutant SPOPF102C. Depletion of SPOP via RNAi leads to Nup153 stabilization. Upon loss of SPOP, the nuclear envelope localization of spindle assembly checkpoint protein Mad1, which is tethered to the nuclear envelope by Nup153, is stronger. Altogether, our results demonstrate SPOP regulates Nup153 levels and expands our understanding of the role of SPOP in protein and cellular homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "The synaptonemal complex (SC) is a hallmark of meiotic prophase that plays a crucial role in regulating crossovers between homologous chromosomes. Here, we demonstrate that two Skp1-related proteins in C. elegans, SKR-1 and SKR-2, serve as structural components of the SC, independent of their canonical functions within the Skp1-Cul1-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex. SKR-1 and SKR-2 localize to the central region of the SC, and synapsis requires their dimerization through a hydrophobic interface that overlaps with the binding sites for CUL-1 and F-box proteins. Using in vitro reconstitution and in vivo analysis of mutant proteins, we show that SKR proteins interact with the other SC proteins using their C-terminal helices to form a soluble complex, which likely represents a basic building block for SC assembly. Our findings demonstrate how conserved Skp1 proteins are repurposed as part of the SC and may provide insight into how synapsis is coupled to cell cycle progression.",

    "abstract": "The primary cilium is a signaling organelle with a unique membrane composition maintained by a diffusional barrier residing at the transition zone. Many transition zone proteins, such as the tectonic complex, are linked to preserving ciliary composition; however, whether these proteins regulate active transport or physically impede membrane diffusion remains unknown. To understand tectonics role, we generated a photoreceptor specific Tctn1 knockout mouse. Loss of Tctn1 resulted in an absence of the entire tectonic complex yet had minimal effects on transition zone structure. Interestingly, we found that protein composition of the photoreceptor cilium was disrupted as non-resident membrane proteins accumulated in the cilium over time, ultimately resulting in photoreceptor degeneration. We further show that membrane proteins moved faster through the transition zone illustrating that the tectonic complex acts as a physical barrier to slow diffusion of membrane proteins so they can be properly sorted by ciliary transport carriers.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell immuno-heterogeneity has always been the forerunner of any change in homeostasis of cellular functions in the body. Mesenchymal stem cells represent a viable source for the development of cell-based therapies. Multiple conditions giving rise to inter, and intra-population variations result in heterogeneity and multipotent differentiation ability of these cells of stromal origin. Cell surface markers which are important members of membrane proteins, ion channels, transporter, adhesion, and signaling molecules generally differentiate between stromal cells of different origin. However, existing analytical tools cannot always model a pattern of their surface distribution in successive generations of growth and proliferation. In this study, we have developed a post-acquisition image analysis pipeline for human mesenchymal stromal cells obtained from exfoliated deciduous teeth (hSHEDs). Using the open-source image processing software CellProfiler, a pipeline has been developed to extract cellular features from 50,000-100,000 single-cell images. We made use of the image flow cytometry technology to explore the morphometric properties of hSHEDs, along with their surface marker distribution. This unbiased pipeline can extract cellular, geometrical and texture features such as shape, size, eccentricity, entropy, intensities as a measure of cellular heterogeneity. For the first time, we have described an automated, unbiased image assessment protocol implemented in a validated open-source software, leveraging the suite of image-based measurements to develop the prototype named as MSCProfiler. The hallmark of this screening workflow has been the identification and removal of image-based aberrations to identify the single-cell bright field and fluorescent images of mesenchymal stem cells.",

Theory predicts that spatial connectivity and the local environment interact to shape resilience, but empirical studies are scarce. Here, we use >7000 fish samplings from the Baltic Sea coast to test this prediction in an ongoing, spatially propagating shift in dominance from predatory fish to an opportunistic mesopredator, with cascading effects throughout the food web. After controlling for the influence of the driver (increasing mesopredator densities), we find that predatory fish habitat connectivity increases resilience towards the shift, but only when densities of fish-eating top predators (seals, cormorants) are low. Resilience also increases with temperature, likely through boosted predatory fish growth and recruitment. These findings confirm theoretical predictions that spatial connectivity and the local environment can act together to shape resilience towards regime shifts.",

    "abstract": "Modification of natural habitats can lead to an ecological trap, as animals can maladaptively select lower-quality habitats over natural landscapes. Modified habitats reduce group size and prevalence, the success of dispersing individuals, and breeding success. However, little is known about how these effects on fitness affect the sociality of cooperative breeding species, which may be particularly susceptible to habitat modification. Here we show that the selection of anthropogenically modified habitats negatively affects the fitness, which has consequences in the life history traits of a cooperative breeder.\n\nWe used data collected during six years from a monitored population of Arabian babblers (Argya squamiceps) and found that groups living in modified habitats breed more than those in natural habitats but that juvenile and adult survival in modified habitats was lower. Individuals living in modified habitats acquired dominance earlier than individuals from natural habitats. Males in modified habitats also dispersed earlier than those from natural habitats.\n\nOur results suggest that modified habitats entail an ecological trap for Arabian babblers, which adjusts their life history traits as a response. Understanding the adaptation of social and cooperative breeding species to habitat modification is the first step for mitigating the processes behind human-related population declines.",

    "abstract": "Demographic studies that quantify species performances for survival, growth, and reproduction are powerful means to understand and predict how species and communities respond to environmental change through the characterization of population dynamics and sources of demographic bottlenecks. However, demographic studies require fine-scale surveys of populations in the field, and are often too effort-intensive to be replicable at large scale and in the long-term. To surpass this obstacle, we developed a digital approach for extracting demographic data on species abundances, sizes, and positions within video-transects, facilitating back-from-the-field data acquisitions on population and community dynamics from video surveys. The approach is based on manual coral identification, size-measurements, and mapping along video-transects, mimicking what is traditionally performed in the field, thought it can be automated in the future with the deployment of artificial intelligence. We illustrate our approach with the characterizations of species demographic performances using surveys of a reef-building coral community in New Caledonia recorded with underwater cameras, therefore optimizing time spent in the field. The results provide quantitative measures of coral community composition and demographic performances as key ecological indicators of coral reef health, shed light on species life strategies and constraints to their demographics, and open paths for further quantitative investigations. Key findings include the diversity of species life strategies in terms of relative investment in survival, growth, and reproduction found among taxa dominating the coral community, indicating the diversity of demographic paths to ecological success and that several species have adapted mechanisms to prevail under limiting hydrodynamic environments. Our approach facilitates image-based extractions of demographic data, helping to accelerate empirical endeavors in ecology and ecosystem management.\n\nAuthor summarySustainable ecosystem management requires comprehension of key ecological processes that affect species resilience. Accurate and reoccurring measurements of species helps us understand how they are responding to various environments and predict what might happen in the future. We developed a digital approach that mimics measurements traditionally performed in the field to measure species abundance, size, and distributions using video records of the ecosystems. This transition to imagery-based surveys helps researchers and managers acquire fine-scale ecological data while optimizing time spent in the field, particularly for studying remote and extreme environments where access is limited. We illustrate the application of our approach by characterizing the dynamics of a coral community in the vast tropical reef system of New Caledonia, where such evaluations of demographic processes controlling coral resilience are inexistent but necessary.",

In this study, we used a dataset built from 32 populations situated in the southern limit of the kelp species Laminaria digitata. By extracting data from 11 microsatellite markers, our aim was to (1) refine the analyses of population structure, (2) compare connectivity patterns and genetic diversity between island and mainland populations and (3) evaluate the influence of sampling year, hydrodynamic processes, habitat discontinuity, spatial distance and sea surface temperature on the genetic structure using a distance-based redundancy analysis (db-RDA). Analyses of population structure enabled to identify well connected populations associated to high genetic diversity, and others which appeared genetically isolated from neighboring populations and showing signs of genetic erosion verifying contrasting ecological (and demographic) status in Brittany and the English Channel. By performing db-RDA analyses on various sampling sizes, geographic distance appeared as the dominant factor influencing connectivity between populations separated by great distances, while hydrodynamic processes were the main factor at smaller scale. Finally, Lagrangian simulations enabled to study the directionality of gene flow which has implications on source-sink dynamics. Overall, our results have important significance in regard to the management of kelp populations facing pressures both from global warming and their exploitation for commercial use.",

    "abstract": "Variation in gene copy number can alter gene expression and influence downstream phenotypes; thus copy-number variation (CNV) provides a route for rapid evolution if the benefits outweigh the cost. We recently showed that genetic background significantly influences how yeast cells respond to gene over-expression (OE), revealing that the fitness costs of CNV can vary substantially with genetic background in a common-garden environment. But the interplay between CNV tolerance and environment remains unexplored on a genomic scale. Here we measured the tolerance to gene OE in four genetically distinct Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains grown under sodium chloride (NaCl) stress. OE genes that are commonly deleterious during NaCl stress recapitulated those commonly deleterious under standard conditions. However, NaCl stress uncovered novel differences in strain responses to gene OE. West African strain NCYC3290 and North American oak isolate YPS128 are more sensitive to NaCl stress than vineyard BC187 and laboratory strain BY4743. Consistently, NCYC3290 and YPS128 showed the greatest sensitivities to gene OE. Although most genes were deleterious, hundreds were beneficial when overexpressed - remarkably, most of these effects were strain specific. Few beneficial genes were shared between the NaCl-sensitive isolates, implicating mechanistic differences behind their NaCl sensitivity. Transcriptomic analysis suggested underlying vulnerabilities and tolerances across strains, and pointed to natural CNV of a sodium export pump that likely contributes to strain-specific responses to OE of other genes. Our results reveal extensive strain-by-environment interaction in the response to gene CNV, raising important implications for the accessibility of CNV-dependent evolutionary routes under times of stress.",

    "abstract": "1Genetic improvements of discrete characteristics such as flower color, the genetic improvements are obvious and easy to demonstrate; however, for characteristics that are measured on continuous scales, the genetic contributions are incremental and less obvious. Reliable and accurate methods are required to disentangle the confounding genetic and non-genetic components of quantitative traits. Stochastic simulations of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) breeding programs were performed to evaluate models to estimate the realized genetic gain (RGG) from 30 years of multi-environment trials (MET). True breeding values were simulated under an infinitesimal model to represent the genetic contributions to soybean seed yield under various MET conditions. Estimators were evaluated using objective criteria of bias and linearity. Results indicated all estimation models were biased. Covariance modeling as well as direct versus indirect estimation resulted in substantial differences in RGG estimation. Although there were no unbiased models, the three best-performing models resulted in an average bias of {+/-}7.41 kg/ha-1/yr-1 ({+/-}0.11 bu/ac-1/yr-1). Rather than relying on a single model to estimate RGG, we recommend the application of multiple models and consider the range of the estimated values. Further, based on our simulations parameters, we do not think it is appropriate to use any single models to compare breeding programs or quantify the efficiency of proposed new breeding strategies. Lastly, for public soybean programs breeding for maturity groups II and III in North America from 1989 to 2019, the range of estimated RGG values was from 18.16 to 39.68 kg/ha-1/yr-1 (0.27 to 0.59 bu/ac-1/yr-1).",

In this study, we employed Oxford Nanopore sequencing to resolve all genotype-phenotype discrepancies in the Kidd blood group system (JK, SLC14A1) observed over seven years of routine high-throughput donor genotyping using a mass spectrometry based platform at Blood Transfusion Service Zurich. Discrepant results of standard serological typing and donor genotyping were confirmed by commercial PCR-SSP kits. To resolve discrepancies, we amplified the entire coding region of SLC14A1 ([~]24 kb, exons 3 to 10) in two overlapping long-range PCRs in all samples. Amplicons were barcoded and sequenced on a MinION flow cell. Sanger sequencing and bridge-PCRs were used to confirm findings. Among 11,972 donors who had both serology and genotypic data available for the Kidd system, we identified 10 cases with unexplained conflicting results. Five were linked to known weak and null alleles caused by variants not included in the routine donor genotyping. In two cases, we identified novel null alleles on the JK*01 (Gly40Asp; c.119G>A) and JK*02 (Gly242Glu; c.725G>A) haplotype, respectively. Remarkably, the remaining three cases were linked to a yet unknown deletion of [~]5 kb spanning over exon 9-10 of the JK*01 allele, which other molecular methods had failed to detect. Overall, nanopore sequencing demonstrated reliable and accurate performance for detecting both single nucleotide and structural variants.

    "abstract": "Tilapia aquaculture faces significant threats posed by four prominent pathogens: tilapia lake virus (TiLV), infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV), Francisella orientalis, and Streptococcus agalactiae. Currently, employed molecular diagnostic methods for these pathogens rely on multiple singleplex PCR reactions, which are both time-consuming and expensive. In this study, we present a pioneering approach utilizing a novel multiplex PCR (mPCR) assay, coupled with rapid Nanopore sequencing, enabling for the one-tube simultaneous detection and one-reaction Nanopore sequencing-based identification of all four pathogens. Our one-tube multiplex assay exhibits a detection limit of 1,000 copies per reaction for TiLV, ISKNV, and S. agalactiae, while for F. orientalis, the detection limit is 10,000 copies per reaction. This capability allows for the detection of single infections as well as co-infections in clinical samples within a single day. Moreover, the consensus sequences generated from the amplicons of each sample demonstrate 100% sequence identity with publicly available data, providing strong support for the improving accuracy of Nanopore sequencing. The integration of multiplex PCR and Nanopore sequencing provides a promising and cost-effective platform for rapid and precise diagnostics of major tilapia pathogens, making it a valuable tool for enhancing health management practices within the aquaculture industry, ultimately contributing to improved disease control and prevention.",

    "abstract": "1.Single-domain antibodies, also known as nanobodies, are broadly important for studying the structure and conformational states of several classes of proteins, including membrane proteins, enzymes, and amyloidogenic proteins. Conformational nanobodies specific for aggregated conformations of amyloidogenic proteins are particularly needed to better target and study aggregates associated with a growing class of associated diseases, especially neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimers and Parkinsons diseases. However, there are few reported nanobodies with both conformational and sequence specificity for amyloid aggregates, especially for large and complex proteins such as the tau protein associated with Alzheimers disease, due to difficulties in selecting nanobodies that bind to complex aggregated proteins. Here, we report the selection of conformational nanobodies that selectively recognize aggregated (fibrillar) tau relative to soluble (monomeric) tau. Notably, we demonstrate that these nanobodies can be directly isolated from immune libraries using quantitative flow cytometric sorting of yeast-displayed libraries against tau aggregates conjugated to quantum dots, and this process eliminates the need for secondary nanobody screening. The isolated nanobodies demonstrate conformational specificity for tau aggregates in brain samples from both transgenic tau mouse models and human tauopathies. We expect that our facile approach will be broadly useful for isolating conformational nanobodies against diverse amyloid aggregates and other complex antigens.",

Off-the-shelf therapies may address these gaps, but further development is needed. The NK92 cell line has a natural killer-like phenotype, has efficacy in cancer clinical trials, and is safe after irradiation. However, NK92 lose activity post-injection, limiting efficacy. This may be addressed by engineering NK92 to express stimulatory factors, for which comparative analysis is needed. Thus, we systematically explored expression of synthetic cytokines for enhancing NK92 production and performance. All synthetic cytokines evaluated (membrane-bound IL2 and IL15, and engineered versions of Neoleukin-2/15, IL15, IL12, and decoy resistant IL18) enhanced NK92 cytotoxicity. Genetically modified cells preferentially expanded by expressing membrane-bound but not soluble synthetic cytokines, and all engineered cells remained sensitive to irradiation. Interestingly, some membrane-bound cytokines conferred cell-contact independent paracrine activity partly attributable to extracellular vesicles. Finally, we characterized interactions within consortia of differently engineered NK92.",

However, phasing is limited by read length and stretches of homozygosity along the genome. To overcome this limitation, we designed MethPhaser, the first method that utilizes methylation signals from Oxford Nanopore Technologies to extend SNV-based phasing. Across control samples, we extend the phase length N50 by almost 3-fold while minimally increasing the phasing error by [~]0.02%. Nevertheless, methylation signals have limitations, such as random signals on sex chromosomes or tissue purity. To assess the latter, we also applied MethPhaser on blood samples from 4 patients, still showing improvements over SNV-only phasing. MethPhaser further improves phasing across HLA and multiple other medically relevant genes, improving our understanding of how mutations interact across multiple phenotypes.

Moreover, current computational methods (\"pickers\") identify different particle sets, complicating the selection of the best-suited picker for a protein of interest. Here, we present REPIC, an ensemble learning methodology that uses multiple pickers to find consensus particles. REPIC identifies consensus particles by framing its task as a graph problem and using integer linear programming to select particles. REPIC picks high-quality particles when the best picker is not known a priori and for known difficult-to-pick particles (e.g., TRPV1). Reconstructions using consensus particles achieve resolutions comparable to those from particles picked by experts, without the need for downstream particle filtering. Overall, our results show REPIC requires minimal (often no) manual picking and significantly reduces the burden on cryo-EM users for picker selection and particle picking.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/ccameron/REPIC",

    "abstract": "Genomic selection and gene editing in crops could be enhanced by multi-species, mechanistic models predicting effects of changes in gene regulation. Current expression abundance prediction models require extensive computational resources, hard-to-measure species-specific training data, and often fail to incorporate data from multiple species. We hypothesize that gene expression prediction models that harness the regulatory network structure of Arabidopsis thaliana transcription factor-target gene interactions will improve on the present maize models. To this end, we collect 147 Oryza sativa and 99 Sorghum bicolor gene expression assays and assign them to maize family-based orthologous groups. Using three popular graph-based machine learning frameworks, including a shallow graph convolutional autoencoder, a deep graph convolutional autoencoder, and the inductive GraphSage strategy, we encode an Arabidopsis thaliana integrated gene regulatory network (iGRN) structure and TF gene expression values to predict gene expression both within and between species. We then evaluate the network methods against a partial least-squares baseline. We find that the baseline gives the best predictions within species, with Spearman correlations averaging between 0.74 and 0.78. The graph autoencoder methods were more variable with correlations between -0.1 and 0.65. In particular, the GraphSage and deep autoencoders performed the worst, and the shallow autoencoders performed the best. In the most challenging prediction context, where predictions were in new species and on genes that were not seen, we found that the shallow graph autoencoder framework averaged around 0.65. Unlike initial thoughts about preserved network structure improving gene expression predictions, this study shows that within-species predictions only need simple models, such as partial least squares, to capture expression variations. In cross-species predictions, the best model is often a more complex strategy utilizing regulatory network structure and other studies expressions.",

    "abstract": "Single-molecule and bulk biophysical approaches to study protein-DNA interactions on surface-immobilised nucleic acid templates typically rely on modifying the ends of linear DNA molecules to enable surface-DNA attachments. Unless both strands are constrained, this results in topologically-free DNA molecules and the inability to observe supercoiling-dependent biological processes, or requires additional means to micro-manipulate the free DNA end to impose rotational constraints or induce supercoiling. We developed a method using RecA protein to induce the formation of a circularised compliment-stabilised D-loop. The resulting joint molecule is topologically closed, surface anchorable and stable under microfluidic flow. Importantly, the method obviates the need for subsequent manipulation of surface tethered DNA; tethered molecules remain supercoiled and retain accessibility to DNA binding proteins. This approach adds to the toolkit for those studying processes on DNA that require supercoiled DNA templates or topologically constrained systems.\n\nWHY IT MATTERSSupercoiling plays an important role in regulating genetic processes such as DNA replication and transcription. We have developed a facile method to immobilise large (supra diffraction-limited) supercoiled DNA substrates without the need for complex trapping modalities to allow biophysical interrogation of the surface-tethered DNA molecules. This will expand the toolkit for experimentalists interested in studying protein-DNA interactions at the single-molecule or ensemble level requiring the use of topologically closed or supercoiling-dependent systems such as origin-dependent bacterial DNA replication.",

Convergent data have led to a model where AR both regulates, and is regulated by, the DDR. Integral to this model is that the AR regulates the transcription of DDR genes both at steady state and in response to ionizing radiation (IR). In this study, we sought to determine which immediate transcriptional changes are induced by IR in an AR-dependent manner. Using PRO-seq to quantify changes in nascent RNA transcription in response to IR, the AR antagonist enzalutamide, or the combination of the two, we find that enzalutamide treatment significantly decreased expression of canonical AR target genes but had no effect on DDR gene sets in PCa cells. Surprisingly, we also found that the AR is not a primary regulator of DDR genes either in response to IR or at steady state in asynchronously growing PCa cells. Our data indicate that the clinical benefit of ADT and RT is not due to the direct regulation of DDR gene transcription by AR.",

To investigate the contribution of cell-scale functional remodeling to AF pathogenesis, we combined personalized 3D anatomical models with pathology-specific ionic models.

To quantify AF dynamics, we developed a novel algorithm for locating RDs by backtracking the conduction velocity field from the wavebreak regions. We demonstrate that our novel algorithm is at least 700 times faster than the traditional phase singularity analysis. The inducibility of simulated AF was not pathology-dependent, but pathological models demonstrate a more extensive arrhythmogenic substrate compared to the sinus rhythm. AF driver locations depend on electrophysiological remodeling; differences between pathology-specific models are explained by differences in wavebreak patterns. Specifically, RDs tend to dwell in the regions with the highest wavebreak probability.",

Previous work has suggested that the mitochondria-ER-cortex anchor (MECA), a tripartite membrane contact site between mitochondria, the ER, and the plasma membrane, is involved in mitochondrial division. However, its role is poorly understood. We developed a system to control MECA formation and depletion, which allowed us to investigate the relationship between MECA-mediated contact sites and mitochondrial division. Num1 is the protein that mediates mitochondria-ER-plasma membrane tethering at MECA sites. Using both rapamycin-inducible dimerization and auxin-inducible degradation components coupled with Num1, we developed systems to temporally control the formation and depletion of the native contact site. Additionally, we designed a regulatable Num1-independant mitochondria-PM tether. We found that mitochondria-PM tethering alone is not sufficient to rescue mitochondrial division and that a specific feature of Num1-mediated tethering is required. This study demonstrates the utility of systems that regulate contact site formation and depletion in studying the biological functions of membrane contact sites.",

    "abstract": "Siphonophores (Cnidaria:Hydrozoa) are abundant predators found throughout the ocean and are important components in worldwide zooplankton. They range in length from a few centimeters to tens of meters. They are gelatinous, fragile, and difficult to collect, so many aspects of the biology of these 190 species remain poorly understood. To survey siphonophore genome diversity, we performed Illumina sequencing of 32 species sampled broadly across the phylogeny. Sequencing depth was sufficient to estimate nuclear genome size from k-mer spectra in 8 specimens, ranging from 0.7-4.8Gb. In 6 specimens we got heterozygosity estimates between 0.7-5.3%. Rarefaction analyses indicate k-mer peaks can be absent with as much as 30x read coverage, suggesting minimum genome sizes range from 1.0-3.8Gb in the remaining 27 samples without k-mer peaks. This work confirms most siphonophore nuclear genomes are large, but also identifies several with reduced size that are tractable targets for future siphonophore nuclear genome assembly projects. We also assembled mitochondrial genomes for 32 specimens from these new data, indicating a conserved gene order among Hydrozoa, Cystonectae and some Physonectae, also revealing the ancestral gene organization of siphonophores. There then was extensive rearrangement of mitochondrial genomes within other physonects and in Calycophorae, including the repeated loss of atp8. Though siphonophores comprise a small fraction of cnidarian species, this survey greatly expands our understanding of cnidarian genome diversity. This study further illustrates both the importance of deep phylogenetic sampling and the utility of Illumina genome skimming in understanding genomic diversity of a clade.\n\nSignificanceDescriptions of basic genome features, such as nuclear genome size and mitochondrial genome sequences, remain sparse across many clades in the tree of life, leading to over generalizations from very small sample sizes and often limiting selection of optimal species for genome assembly efforts. Here we use Illumina genome skimming to assess a variety of genome features across 35 siphonophores (Cnidaria). This deep dive within a single clade identifies six species that are optimal candidates of future genomic work, and reveals greater range in nuclear genome size and diversity of mitochondrial genome orders within siphonophores than had been described across all Cnidaria.",

    "abstract": "Tandem repeat (TR) variation is associated with gene expression changes and over 50 rare monogenic diseases. Recent advances in sequencing have enabled accurate, long reads that can characterize the full-length sequence and methylation profile of TRs. However, despite these advances in sequencing technology, computational methods to fully profile tandem repeats across the genome do not exist. To address this gap, we introduce tools for tandem repeat genotyping (TRGT), visualization and an accompanying TR database. TRGT accurately resolves the length and sequence composition of TR regions in the human genome. Assessing 937,122 TRs, TRGT showed a Mendelian concordance of 99.56%, allowing a single repeat unit difference. In six samples with known repeat expansions, TRGT detected all repeat expansions while also identifying methylation signals, mosaicism, and providing finer resolution of repeat length. Additionally, we release a database with allele sequences and methylation levels for 937,122 TRs across 100 genomes.",

    "abstract": "We describe the problem of computing local feature attributions for dimensionality reduction methods. We use one such method that is well established within the context of supervised classification - using the gradients of target outputs with respect to the inputs - on the popular dimensionality reduction technique t-SNE, widely used in analyses of biological data. We provide an efficient implementation for the gradient computation for this dimensionality reduction technique. We show that our explanations identify significant features using novel validation methodology; using synthetic datasets and the popular MNIST benchmark dataset. We then demonstrate the practical utility of our algorithm by showing that it can produce explanations that agree with domain knowledge on a SARS-CoV-2 sequence dataset. Throughout, we provide a road map so that similar explanation methods could be applied to other dimensionality reduction techniques to rigorously analyze biological datasets.",

    "abstract": "While the dose modulation (DM) protocols (DM Cocktail Tandem, DM Ping-Pong Alternate Every Cycle, DM Ping-Pong on Progression) involves adjusting drug dosages when the tumor burden changes, the fixed-dose (FD) protocols involves administering a specific, constant dosage of the drug only when the tumor is growing (Dose-Skipping) or when the absolute tumor burden is above the baseline level until it reduces to a certain percentage of the baseline (Intermittent). Moreover, two different drugs can be administered simultaneously (cocktail), or the drugs can be switched such that only one drug is applied at a given time (ping-pong), either every cycle (ping-pong alternate every cycle) or when the tumor grows (ping-pong on progression). The dose modulation protocols work well when treated with two cytotoxic drugs, however, the ping-pong protocols (DM Ping-Pong Alternate Every Cycle, DM Ping-Pong on Progression, FD Ping-Pong Intermittent) work well when treated with two cytostatic drugs. In general, adaptive therapy, using either two cytotoxic or two cytostatic drugs works best under conditions of high competition, such as high fitness cost, high replacement rates, and high turnover, although treatment using two cytostatic drugs works best under low turnover in many cases. Adaptive therapy works best when drug dosages are changed as soon as a change in tumor burden is detected, and it is best to pause treatment sooner rather than later when the tumor is shrinking. Adaptive therapy works best when an intermediate level of drug dosage is used, and both treatment with too little or too much drug leads to poor survival outcome.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are required for energy production and even give brown adipose tissue (BAT) its characteristic color due to their high iron content and abundance. The physiological function and bioenergetic capacity of mitochondria are connected to the structure, folding, and organization of its inner-membrane cristae. During the aging process, mitochondrial dysfunction is observed, and the regulatory balance of mitochondrial dynamics is often disrupted, leading to increased mitochondrial fragmentation in aging cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that significant morphological changes in BAT mitochondria and cristae would be present with aging. We developed a quantitative three-dimensional (3D) electron microscopy approach to map cristae network organization in mouse BAT to test this hypothesis. Using this methodology, we investigated the 3D morphology of mitochondrial cristae in adult (3-month) and aged (2-year) murine BAT tissue via serial block face-scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) and 3D reconstruction software for manual segmentation, analysis, and quantification. Upon investigation, we found increases in mitochondrial volume, surface area, and complexity and decreased sphericity in aged BAT, alongside significant decreases in cristae volume, area, perimeter, and score. Overall, these data define the nature of the mitochondrial structure in murine BAT across aging.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=144 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/540609v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@96099borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@50b4f4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@983092org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19ceb9b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOGraphical Abstract:C_FLOATNO Overview of serial block facing-scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) workflow, data segmentation, and 3D analysis of mitochondria using Amira software for murine interscapular BAT.\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "The crustacean female sex hormone (CFSH) has been identified as a female-specific hormone that plays a crucial role in female phenotype developments in the blue crab Callinectes sapidus. To date, its homologous genes have been reported in various decapod species. Additionally, unlike the blue crab, several species have two different CFSH subtypes. The kuruma prawn Marsupenaeus japonicus is a representative example species of this phenomenon, having two CFSH subtypes identified from the eyestalk (MajCFSH) and ovary (MajCFSH-ov). Eyestalk-type MajCFSH is expressed predominantly in the eyestalk at the same level in both sexes, indicating no female-specificity. Here, we conducted gene knockdown analysis of eyestalk-type MajCFSH using sexually immature juveniles of kuruma prawn (average body length: [~]10 mm) to elucidate its physiological functions. As a result, MajCFSH-knockdown did not affect the development of sex-specific characteristics such as external reproductive organs, while it induced apparent growth suppression in male juveniles, implying that MajCFSH may play a male-specific juvenile growth role. Moreover, MajCFSH-knockdown female and male juveniles changed their body color to become brighter, indicating that MajCFSH has the ability to change body color by dispersing the pigment granules in the chromatophore. Overall, our present study improved our understanding of the physiological roles of CFSH using kuruma prawn.\n\nHighlights- MajCFSH-knockdown was conducted using sexually immature juveniles of kuruma prawn.\n- MajCFSH-knockdown male juveniles showed significant growth suppression.\n- MajCFSH-knockdown female and male juveniles changed their body color to become brighter.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSite specificity is known in neuropsychiatric disorders, and differences in gene expression patterns could potentially explain this mechanism. However, studies using long-read transcriptome sequencing to analyze gene expression in different regions of the human brain have been limited, and none have focused on the hypothalamus, which plays a crucial role in regulating autonomic functions.\n\nResultsWe performed long-read RNA sequencing on 12 samples derived from three different brain regions of the same individuals; the cerebellum, hypothalamus, and temporal cortex. We found that, compared to other regions, many genes with higher expression levels in the cerebellum and temporal cortex were associated with neuronal pathways, whereas those with higher expression levels in the hypothalamus were primarily linked to immune pathways. In addition, we investigated genes with different major isoforms in each brain region, even with similar overall expression levels among regions, and identified several genes, such as GAS7, that express different major isoforms in different regions. Many of these genes are involved in \"actin filament-based process\" and \"cell projection organization\" pathways, suggesting that region-dependent isoforms may have distinct roles in dendritic spine and neuronal formation in each region. Furthermore, we investigated the involvement of DNA methylation in these isoforms and found that DNA methylation may be associated with isoforms that have different first exons.\n\nConclusionsOur results provide potentially valuable findings for future research on brain disorders and shed light on the mechanisms underlying isoform diversity in the human brain.",

Since 2016, Europe and France have faced major epizootics caused by clade 2.3.4.4b H5 HPAIV. To reduce sample-to-result times, point-of-care testing is urgently needed to help prevent further outbreaks and the propagation of the virus. This study presents the design of a novel real-time colorimetric reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for the detection of clade 2.3.4.4b H5 HPAIV. A clinical validation of this RT-LAMP assay was performed on 198 pools of clinical swabs sampled in 52 poultry flocks during the H5 HPAI 2020-2022 epizootics in France. This RT-LAMP assay allowed the specific detection of HPAIV H5Nx clade 2.3.4.4b within 30 minutes with a sensitivity of 86.11%. This rapid, easy-to-perform, inexpensive, molecular detection assay could be included in the HPAIV surveillance toolbox.",

    "abstract": "Phosphoprotein phosphatases (PPPs) dephosphorylate Serine (Ser)/Threonine (Thr) residues to regulate major signaling pathways and cellular transitions. Despite the central role of PPPs the substrates in most cellular processes and the determinants of phosphatase specificity are poorly understood. This is because methods to investigate this at scale are lacking. Here we develop a novel in vitro assay, MRBLE:Dephos, that allows multiplexing of dephosphorylation reactions to determine phosphatase preferences. Using MRBLE:Dephos, we establish amino acid preferences of the residues surrounding the dephosphorylation site for PP1 and PP2A- B55, which reveals common and unique preferences for the two phosphatases. To compare the MRBLE:Dephos results to cellular substrates, we focused on mitotic exit that requires extensive dephosphorylation by PP1 and PP2A-B55. We use specific inhibition of PP1 and PP2A-B55 in mitotic exit lysates coupled with quantitative phosphoproteomics to identify more than 2000 regulated phosphorylation sites. Importantly, the sites dephosphorylated during mitotic exit reveal key signatures that are consistent with the MRBLE:Dephos results. We use these insights to specifically alter INCENP dephosphorylation kinetics at mitotic exit, resulting in defective cytokinesis thus underscoring the biological relevance of our determined specificity principles. Finally, we provide a comprehensive characterization of PP1 binding motifs and demostrate how binding of phosphatases to substrates shapes dephosphorylation specificity. Collectively, we develop novel approaches to advance our ability to investigate protein phosphatases and use these to provide a framework for understanding mitotic exit regulation by dephosphorylation.",

However, a full understanding of the gene expression changes driving fate transitions has been hindered because stem cells are sparsely distributed in tissues. Here, we have overcome these technical limitations to perform RNA-seq and Ribo-seq at high temporal resolution during Drosophila female germline stem cell differentiation in vivo. While the data uncovers the extensive remodelling of both the transcriptome and translatome, we observed 3-fold more changes in translation compared to mRNA level. Furthermore, changes in mRNA level were frequently buffered by changing translation efficiency to stabilise the final rate of translation. Contrary to the expected cumulative changes, following gene expression throughout differentiation reveals two distinct waves of remodelling at both the transcriptome and translatome level. Altogether, our data provide a systematic and genome-wide roadmap of the changes in gene expression occurring during the differentiation process in vivo.",

Wind energy projects are emerging in the Mediterranean Sea, and unbiased knowledge on seabird flight altitudes are scarce in this area. Indeed, previous flight height observations were carried out from boats during daytime, and only in good weather conditions. We measured flight heights of 13 Scopolis shearwaters, Calonectris diomedea, one of the three endemic shearwater species in the Mediterranean, using highly precise barometric data loggers. The birds were equipped at the largest French colony of Scopolis shearwater in the Marseille archipelago. Birds from this location routinely visit forthcoming wind farm areas, within 50 km of their breeding site. We found that Scopolis shearwaters flew at very low altitudes with a mean flight height of 1.8 {+/-} 2.7 m ({+/-} SD) above sea level. Birds therefore rarely (<0.02%) flew within the vertical envelop of collision risk with wind turbines. Ours results are coherent with field observations and the dynamic soaring flight technique used by shearwaters.\n\nNevertheless, collision risk may increase following behavioural modifications close to wind turbines.",

    "abstract": "Genome sizes are known to vary within and among closely related species, but the knowledge about genomic factors contributing to the variation and their impacts on gene functions is limited to only a small number of species. This study identified a more than twofold heritable genome size variation among the unicellular Zygnematophycean alga, Closterium peracerosum-strigosum-littorale (C. psl.) complex, based on short-read sequencing analysis of 22 natural strains and F1 segregation analysis. Six de novo assembled genomes revealed that genome size variation is largely attributable to genome-wide copy number variation (CNV) among strains rather than mating type-linked genomic regions or specific repeat sequences such as rDNA. Notably, about 30% of genes showed CNV even between strains that can mate with each other. Transcriptome and gene ontology analysis demonstrated that CNV is distributed nonrandomly in terms of gene functions, such that CNV was more often observed in the gene set with stage-specific expression. Furthermore, in about 30% of these genes with CNV, the expression level does not increase proportionally with the gene copy number, suggesting presence of dosage compensation, which was overrepresented in genes involved in basic biological functions, such as translation. Nonrandom patterns in gene duplications and corresponding expression changes in terms of gene functions may contribute to maintaining the high level of CNV associated with extensive genome size variation in the C. psl. complex, despite its possible detrimental effects.",

These proteins act to radically condense the genetic material and linker H1 histone is essential for the further condensation of the chromatin fiber.

    "abstract": "Camptothecin is an important anticancer alkaloid produced by particular plant species. No suitable synthetic route has been established for camptothecin production yet, imposing a stress on plant-based production systems. Endophytes associated with these camptothecin-producing plants have been reported to also produce camptothecin and other high-value phytochemicals. A previous study identified a fungal endophyte Alternaria burnsii NCIM 1409, isolated from Nothapodytes nimmoniana, to be a sustainable producer of camptothecin. Our study provides key insights on camptothecin biosynthesis in this recently discovered endophyte. The whole genome sequence of Alternaria burnsii NCIM 1409 was assembled and screened for biosynthetic gene clusters. Comparative studies with related fungi supported the identification of candidate genes involved in camptothecin synthesis and also helped to understand some aspects of the endophytes defense against the toxic effects of camptothecin. No evidence for horizontal gene transfer of the camptothecin biosynthetic genes from the host plant to the endophyte was detected suggesting an independent evolution of the camptothecin biosynthesis in this fungus.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAbnormal phosphorylation of the microtubule-binding protein tau in the brain is a key pathological marker for Alzheimers disease and additional neurodegenerative tauopathies. However, how hyperphosphorylated tau causes cellular dysfunction or death that underlie neurodegeneration remains an unsolved question critical for the understanding of disease mechanism and the design of efficacious drugs.\n\nMethodsUsing a recombinant hyperphosphorylated tau protein (p-tau) synthesized by the PIMAX approach, we examined how cells responded to the cytotoxic tau and explored means to enhance cellular resistance to tau attack.\n\nResultsUpon p-tau uptake, the intracellular calcium levels rose promptly. Gene expression analyses revealed that p-tau potently triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), ER stress-associated apoptosis, and pro-inflammation in cells. Proteomics studies showed that p-tau diminished heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an ER stress associated anti-inflammation and anti-oxidative stress regulator, while stimulated the accumulation of MIOS and other proteins. P-tau-induced ER stress-associated apoptosis and pro-inflammation are ameliorated by apomorphine, a brain-permeable prescription drug widely used to treat Parkinsons disease symptoms, and by overexpression of HO-1.\n\nConclusionOur results reveal probable cellular functions targeted by hyperphosphorylated tau. Some of these dysfunctions and stress responses have been linked to neurodegeneration in Alzheimers disease. The observations that the ill effects of p-tau can be mitigated by a small compound and by overexpressing HO-1 that is otherwise diminished in the treated cells inform new directions of Alzheimers disease drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "The loading of RecA onto ssDNA by RecBCD is an essential step of RecBCD-mediated homologous recombination. RecBCD facilitates RecA-loading onto ssDNA in a {chi}-dependent manner via its RecB nuclease domain (RecBn). Before recognition of {chi}, RecBn is sequestered through interactions with RecBCD. It was proposed that upon {chi}-recognition, RecBn undocks, allowing RecBn to swing out via a contiguous 70 amino acid linker to reveal the RecA-loading surface, and then recruit and load RecA onto ssDNA. We tested this hypothesis by examining the interactions between RecBn (RecB928-1180) and truncated RecBCD (RecB1-927CD) lacking the nuclease domain. The reconstituted complex of RecB1-927CD and RecBn is functional in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicate that despite being covalently severed from RecB1-927CD, RecBn can still load RecA onto ssDNA, establishing that RecBn does not function at the end of its flexible linker. Instead, RecBCD undergoes a {chi}-induced intramolecular rearrangement to reveal a RecA-loading surface.",

    "abstract": "Subtype discovery is crucial to disease diagnosis and targeted therapy as each cell or patient can display a wide range of responses to specific treatments. It is also vital to investigate the heterogeneity, or diverse variety, of disease states to better understand pathological processes. While there are many new opportunities for subtype discovery due to the explosion of single-cell data (single-cell RNA-seq, proteomic, and imaging datasets), selecting features for disease subtyping from high-dimensional datasets is challenging. Feature selection is the process of reducing the number of features for downstream computational analyses. Most feature selection algorithms are focused on identifying features to aid in the classification of known disease phenotypes. However, this effectively eliminates heterogeneous features and collapses the disease feature space, hindering valuable subtyping. Our work aimed to identify feature sets that preserve heterogeneity while maintaining the discrimination of known disease states. We initially applied a data-driven approach to determine the statistical characteristics of features essential in preserving heterogeneity by combining feature clustering and deep metric learning. This analysis revealed that features with a significant difference in interquartile range (IQR) between classes could contain critical subtype information. Utilizing this knowledge, we developed a statistical method, PHet (Preserving Heterogeneity), that performs recurrent sub-sampling differential analysis of IQR between classes to identify a minimal set of heterogeneity-preserving features while maximizing the quality of subtype clustering. Using public datasets of microarray and single-cell RNA-seq, we demonstrated that PHet effectively identifies disease subtypes and outperforms the previous outlier-based methods. In summary, our study provides a novel feature selection method for disease subtyping, which will enable not only personalized medicine but also a detailed understanding of the underlying heterogeneous mechanisms of diseases.",

Models to predict the presence/absence, high/low, or continuous expression of a gene using images as the only input have a huge potential clinical applications, but such models require improvements in accuracy, interpretability, and robustness. We developed STimage models to estimate parameters of gene expression as distributions rather than fixed data points, thereby allowing for the essential quantification of uncertainty in the predicted results. We assessed aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty of the models across a diverse range of test cases and proposed an ensemble approach to improve the model performance and trust. STimage can train prediction models for one gene marker or a panel of markers and provides important interpretability analyses at a single-cell level, and in the histopathological annotation context. Through a comprehensive benchmarking with existing models, we found that STimage is more robust to technical variation in platforms, data types, and sample types. Using images from the cancer genome atlas, we showed that STimage can be applied to non-spatial omics data. STimage also performs better than other models when only a small training dataset is available. Overall, STimage contributes an important methodological advance needed for the potential application of spatial technology in cancer digital pathology.",

    "abstract": "The glycocalyx is a soft material composed of glycosylated proteins and lipids decorating the plasma membrane of cells. Although the glycocalyx is a mechanical conduit between the plasma membrane and the cell surroundings, the coupled dynamics of the glycocalyx and membrane are poorly understood in most cell processes. Here, we construct a dynamic model to predict the coupled mechanical behaviors of the glycocalyx and membrane due to internal cytosolic pressure in a cell interacting with an external substrate. We report how the glycocalyx constituents bear cytosolic loads, physically rearrange, and shape the cell membrane. Simulations of the model predict that highly flexible, polymeric elements in the glycocalyx are uniformly compressed in the cell-substrate contact zone. However, more rigid, fiber-like glycocalyx constituents dynamically rearrange over timescales on the order of 10 milliseconds, concentrating into clusters. This spatial heterogeneity allows close apposition of the plasma membrane with the substrate, a geometry that would be favorable for subsequent adhesive bond formation. Clustered glycocalyx constituents imprint nanotopographical features on the plasma membrane with longitudinal dimensions of 200 - 300 nm. Analysis of the membrane topographies reveals curvatures that could be sufficient to elicit biological responses through curvature sensing proteins, such as BAR-domain proteins. Together, our simulations suggest how instabilities in the compressed glycocalyx could mediate downstream adhesive and signaling processes in the bleb-substrate interface.",

    "abstract": "Pigmentary coloration is widespread in animals. Its evolutionary and ecological features are often attributed to the property of predominant pigments; therefore, most research has focused on predominant pigments such as carotenoids in carotenoid-based coloration. However, coloration results from predominant pigments and many other minority pigments, and the importance of the latter is overlooked. Here, we focused on porphyrin, an \"uncommon\" pigment found in bird feathers, and investigate its importance in the context of feather color changes in the barn swallow Hirundo rustica. We found that the \"pheomelanin-based coloration\" of the barn swallow faded after the irradiation of UV light, and this effect was particularly strong in the feathers of young swallows (nestlings and fledglings, here). We also found that it is not the predominant pigment, pheomelanin, but protoporphyrin IX pigment that showed the same pattern of depigmentation after the irradiation of UV light, particularly in the feathers of young swallows. In fact, the abovementioned age-dependent feather color change was statistically explained by the amount of porphyrin in the feathers. The current study demonstrates that a minority pigment, porphyrin, explains within-season dynamic color change, an ecological feature of feather coloration. The porphyrin-mediated rapid color change would benefit young birds, in which feather coloration affects the parental food allocation during a few weeks before independence, but not later. Future studies should not ignore these minor but essential pigments and their evolutionary and ecological functions.\n\nSignificance statementPredominant pigments are assumed to determine animal coloration and its ecological features. It is then not surprising that the evolutionary and ecological features of animal coloration are often attributed to the chemical properties of predominant pigments. However, coloration results from predominant pigments and several other minority pigments. By irradiating UV light on reddish throat feathers of the barn swallow Hirundo rustica, we examined within-season dynamic color change in relation to a minority pigment, porphyrin, which has not previously been examined but is a candidate pigment for feather color change, because porphyrin can be easily photodegraded. We found that not the predominant pigment, pheomelanin, but porphyrin pigments explained the feather color change. Minor pigments and their chemical properties should not be dismissed to understand the ecological and evolutionary functions of animal coloration.",

    "abstract": "All sleep EEG recordings can be contaminated by artifacts. Both visual and automatic methods have been developed to mark such erroneous segments of EEG data. Here we systematically explore the effect of artifacts on the sleep EEG power spectrum density (PSD), and we compare gold-standard visual detections to a simple automatic detector using Hjorth parameters to identify artifacts. We find that most distortions in the all-night average PSD occur because of a small minority of highly anomalous artifacts, which mainly affect the beta and gamma frequency ranges and NREM delta. Visual and automatic detections only show moderate agreement in which data segments are artefactual. However, the resulting all-night average PSD is highly similar across all methods, and PSDs calculated with all methods successfully recover the known correlations of PSD with age and sex. No parameter settings of the automatic detector clearly outperformed others. Additionally, we show that accurate average PSD estimates can be recovered from just a fraction of available data epochs. Our results suggest that artifacts represent a minor and easily solvable problem in sleep EEG recordings. Most visually identified artifacts do not seriously distort estimates of mid-frequency activity in the sleep EEG spectrum, and distortions to low and high frequencies can be eliminated using a simple automatic detection method nearly as well as with visual detections. These findings show that the visual inspection of EEG data is not necessary to eliminate the effects of artifacts, which is encouraging for the expected performance of automatic preprocessing in large sleep EEG databases.",

Distal penis erectile enlargement (\"penile cupping\") at ejaculation and forceful expulsion of ejaculatory fluid each provided sufficient mechanical stimulation to elicit serotonin neuron activation.

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of dopamine neurotransmission profoundly affects motor, motivation and learning behaviors, and is often observed during the prodromal phase of Parkinsons disease (PD). However, the mechanism underlying these pathophysiological changes remains to be elucidated. Mutations in vacuolar protein sorting 35 (VPS35) and leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) both lead to autosomal dominant PD, and VPS35 and LRRK2 may physically interact to govern the trafficking of synaptic cargos within the endo-lysosomal network in a kinase-dependent manner. To better understand the functional role of VPS35 and LRRK2 on dopamine physiology, we examined Vps35 haploinsufficient (Haplo) and Vps35 p.D620N knock-in (VKI) mice and how their behavior, dopamine kinetics and biochemistry are influenced by LRRK2 kinase inhibitors. We found Vps35 p.D620N significantly elevates LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of Rab10, Rab12 and Rab29. In contrast, Vps35 haploinsufficiency reduces phosphorylation of Rab12. While striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) expression and function is similarly impaired in both VKI and Haplo mice, that physiology is normalized in VKI by treatment with the LRRK2 kinase inhibitor, MLi-2. As a corollary, VKI animals show a significant increase in amphetamine induced hyperlocomotion, compared to Haplo mice, that is also abolished by MLi-2. Taken together, these data show Vps35 p.D620N confers a gain-of-function with respect to LRRK2 kinase activation, and VPS35 and LRRK2 functionally interact to regulate DAT trafficking and striatal dopamine neurotransmission.",

Functional analysis of genes linked to PD have revealed that the E3 ligase Parkin and the mitochondrial kinase PINK1 are important factors for mitochondrial quality control. PINK1 phosphorylates and activates Parkin, which in turn ubiquitinates mitochondrial proteins priming them and the mitochondrion itself for degradation. However, it is unclear whether dysregulated mitochondrial degradation or the toxic build-up of certain Parkin ubiquitin substrates is the driving pathophysiological mechanism leading to PD. The iron-sulphur cluster containing proteins CISD1 and CISD2 have been identified as major targets of Parkin in various proteomic studies.\n\nMethodsWe employed in vivo Drosophila and human cell culture models to study the role of CISD proteins in cell and tissue viability as well as aged-related neurodegeneration, specifically analysing aspects of mitophagy and autophagy using orthogonal assays.\n\nResultsWe discovered that the Drosophila homolog Cisd accumulates during aging, as well as in Pink1 and parkin mutant flies. We observed that build-up of Cisd is particularly toxic in neurons, resulting in mitochondrial defects and Ser65-phospho-Ubiquitin accumulation. Age-related increase of Cisd blocks mitophagy and impairs autophagy flux. Importantly, reduction of Cisd levels upregulates mitophagy in vitro and in vivo, and ameliorates pathological phenotypes in locomotion, lifespan and neurodegeneration in Pink1/parkin mutant flies. In addition, we show that pharmacological inhibition of CISD1/2 by rosiglitazone and NL-1 induces mitophagy in human cells and rescues the defective phenotypes of Pink1/parkin mutants.\n\nConclusionAltogether, our studies indicate that Cisd accumulation during aging and in Pink1/parkin mutants is a key driver of pathology by blocking mitophagy, and genetically and pharmacologically inhibiting CISD proteins may offer a potential target for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "Motor adaptation reflects the ability of the brains sensorimotor system to flexibly deal with environmental changes to generate effective motor behaviour. Whether sleep contributes to the consolidation of motor adaptation remains controversial. In this study, we investigated the impact of sleep on motor adaptation and its neurophysiological correlates in a novel motor adaptation task that leverages a highly automatized motor skill, i.e., typing. We hypothesized that sleep-associated memory consolidation would benefit motor adaptation and induce modulations in task-related beta band (13-30Hz) activity during adaptation. Healthy young male experts in typing on the regular computer keyboard were trained to type on a vertically mirrored keyboard while brain activity was recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). Typing performance was assessed either after a full night of sleep with polysomnography or a similar period of daytime wakefulness. Results showed improved motor adaptation performance after nocturnal sleep but not after daytime wakefulness, and decreased beta power (a) during mirrored typing as compared to regular typing, and (b) in the post-sleep vs. the pre-sleep mirrored typing sessions. Furthermore, the slope of the EEG signal, a measure of aperiodic brain activity, decreased during mirrored as compared to regular typing. Changes in the EEG spectral slope from pre- to post-sleep mirrored typing sessions were correlated with changes in task performance. Finally, increased fast sleep spindle density (13-15Hz) during the night following motor adaptation training was predictive of successful motor adaptation. These findings suggest that post-training sleep modulates neural activity mechanisms supporting adaptive motor functions.",

    "abstract": "Infection with West Nile Virus (WNV) can drive a wide range of responses, from asymptomatic to flu-like symptoms/fever or severe cases of encephalitis and death. To identify cellular and molecular signatures distinguishing WNV severity, we employed systems profiling of peripheral blood from asymptomatic and severely ill individuals infected with WNV. We interrogated immune responses longitudinally from acute infection through convalescence at 3 months and 1 year employing multiplexed single cell protein and transcriptional profiling (CyTOF and Seq-Well) complemented with matched serum proteomics and metabolomics. At the acute time point, we detected both an elevated proportion of pro-inflammatory markers in innate immune cell types and reduced frequency of regulatory T cell activity in participants with severe infection compared to those with asymptomatic infection. Single-cell transcriptomics of paired samples revealed that asymptomatic donors had higher expression of genes associated with innate immune pathways, in particular anti-inflammatory CD16+ monocytes at the acute time point. A multi-omics analysis identified factors--beyond those from individual analyses--that distinguished immune state trajectory between severity groups. Here we highlighted the potential of systems immunology using multiple cell-type and cell-state-specific analyses to identify correlates of infection severity and host cellular activity contributing to an effective anti-viral response.",

    "abstract": "Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) is a globally important process supplying nutrients and trace elements to the coastal environment, thus playing a pivotal role in sustaining marine primary productivity. Along with nutrients, groundwater also contains allochthonous microbes that are discharged from the terrestrial subsurface into the sea. Currently, little is known about the interactions between groundwater-borne and coastal seawater microbial populations, and their role upon introduction to coastal seawater populations. Here, we investigated seawater microbial abundance, activity and diversity in a site strongly influenced by SGD (in-situ observations), and through laboratory-controlled bottle incubations mimicking different mixing scenarios between SGD (either ambient or filtered through 0.1 {micro}m/0.22 {micro}m) and seawater. Our results demonstrate that the addition of <0.1 {micro}m SGD stimulated heterotrophic activity and increased microbial abundance compared to control, whereas <0.22 {micro}m filtration treatments induced primary productivity rates and Synechococcus growth. Amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene showed a strong shift from a SAR11-rich community in the reference SGD-unaffected coastal samples to a Rhodobacteraceae-dominated one in the <0.1 {micro}m treatment, in agreement with their in-situ enrichment in the SGD field site. These results suggest that despite the significant nutrient input, microbes delivered by SGD may affect the abundance, activity and diversity of intrinsic microbes in coastal seawater. Our results highlight the cryptic interplay between groundwater and seawater microbes in coastal environments, which has important implications for carbon cycling and climate.\n\nKey PointsO_LIGroundwater discharge into the coastal zone delivers both nutrients and allochthonous microbes.\nC_LIO_LIGroundwater microbes interact with seawater populations, by which affecting the delicate autotroph-heterotroph balance.\nC_LIO_LISubterranean microbial processes are key drivers of food webs, potentially affecting biogenic carbon fluxes in the ocean and climate.\nC_LI",

Thus, a more specific method of gene knockdown is needed. Here, we developed \"CRISPR{delta}\", an approach for translational silencing, harnessing catalytically inactive Cas13 proteins (dCas13). Owing to its tight association with mRNA, dCas13 serves as a physical roadblock for scanning ribosomes during translation initiation and does not affect mRNA stability. Guide RNAs covering the start codon lead to the highest efficacy regardless of the translation initiation mechanism: cap-dependent or internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent translation. Strikingly, genome-wide ribosome profiling revealed the extremely high gene knockdown specificity of CRISPR{delta}. Moreover, fusion of a translational repressor to dCas13 ensured further improvement of the knockdown efficacy. Our method provides a framework for translational repression-based gene silencing in eukaryotes.",

While A-to-I RNA editing is essential in mammals, in Caenorhabditis elegans, it is not, making them invaluable for RNA editing research. ADR-2 is the sole A-to-I editing enzyme in C. elegans. Although ADAR localization is well-studied in humans, it is not well-established in C. elegans. In this study, we examine the cellular and tissue-specific localization of ADR-2. We show that while ADR-2 is present in most cells in the embryo, at later stages, the expression is both tissue- and cell-type-specific. Additionally, ADR-2 is present mainly in the nucleus, adjacent to the chromosomes, at all cell cycle stages. We showed that endogenous ADR-2 nuclear localization depends on ADBP-1 and not ADR-1, a prominent RNA editing regulator in C. elegans. In adbp-1 mutant worms, the mislocalization of ADR-2 leads to decreased editing levels as well as de-novo editing, mostly in exons, suggesting that ADR-2 is also functional in the cytoplasm. Besides, ADBP-1 absence affects gene expression. Furthermore, our analysis showed that ADR-2 targets adenosines with different surrounding nucleotides in exons and introns.

Interactions between the epithelium and underlying mesenchyme play a pivotal role in regulating eyelid development. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions remain unclear. Wnt signaling pathways regulate the development of ocular tissues, but their functions in eyelid development are not fully defined. In this study, we find that deletion of {beta}-catenin in supraorbital mesenchyme abolishes eyelid growth by causing decreased proliferation in supraorbital epithelium and underlying mesenchyme. Inhibition of Wnt secretion by deleting Wls in supraorbital epithelium results in failure of eyelid developing, similar to the effects of deleting mesenchymal {beta}-catenin, suggesting that mesenchymal Wnt/{beta}- catenin signaling is controlled by epithelial Wnt ligands during eyelid development. We also found that deletion of p63 results in formation of hypoplastic eyelids and reduced expression of several Wnt ligands in eyelid epithelium, indicating that expression of Wnt ligands in eyelid development is at least partially regulated by p63. Taken together, our data indicate that Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling controls eyelid growth by orchestrating epithelial- mesenchymal interactions.",

    "abstract": "Individual differences in oxygen storage and carrying capacity have been associated with differences in foraging success and fitness-related traits. For air-breathing aquatic animals, such differences can limit diving ability, and thus resource access. As many seabirds deplete their energy reserves during breeding and moulting periods, winter foraging efficiency can influence their breeding behaviour and success. Using gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua), we investigate (1) if inter-individual variation in diving efficiency is associated with indices of oxygen storage and carrying capacity (hemoglobin, hematocrit, body mass), and (2) if an individuals pre breeding foraging effort is associated with these oxygen indices and breeding status. Hemoglobin was positively correlated with diving efficiency, particularly for deeper dives, and only penguins with high hemoglobin levels frequently dove at depth [&ge;] 140m. However, pre-breeding foraging effort increased with hemoglobin levels, a relationship likely explained by the fact that reaching deep offshore waters requires additional travelling compared to nearshore foraging. The relationship with hematocrit was non-linear, suggesting that commonly-used analyses may not be appropriate for this index. We found that early-laying penguins spent less time at sea prior to nesting than non-breeding penguins. Our study suggests that diving ability, and thus likely access to resources, is linked to aerobic capacity, and that lower foraging effort is associated with early laying. These associations suggest that anthropogenic changes (e.g., an increase in shallow water fisheries) may have differing impacts on individuals. Further understanding these links could help the conservation of diving species.",

D. pulicaria has lower genome-wide nucleotide diversity, a smaller effective population size, higher incidence of private alleles, and substantially more linkage-disequilibrium than D. pulex. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that positively selected genes in D. pulicaria are enriched in potentially aging-related categories such as cellular homeostasis, which may explain the extended lifespan in D. pulicaria. We also found that opsin-related genes, which may mediate photoperiodic responses, are under different selection pressures in these two species. Additionally, genes involved in mitochondrial functions, ribosomes, and responses to environmental stimuli are found to be under positive selection in both species.

The model uses long-term evolution theory to examine different interaction scenarios, including conditional preference expression upon recognition of the partners type. We apply the model to the evolution of semi-Kantian preferences at the fitness level, which combine self-interest and a Kantian interest evaluating own behavior in terms of consequences for own fitness if the partner also adopted this behavior. We seek the convergence stable and uninvadable value of the Kantian coefficient, i.e., the weight attached to the Kantian interest, a quantitative trait varying between zero and one. We consider three scenarios: (a) incomplete information; (b) complete information and incomplete plasticity; and (c) complete information and complete plasticity, where individuals not only recognize the type of their interaction partner (complete information), but also conditionally express the Kantian coefficient upon it (complete plasticity). For (a), the Kantian coefficient generally evolves to equal the coefficient of neutral relatedness between interacting individuals; for (b), it evolves to a value that depends on demographic and interaction assumptions, while for (c) there are generally multiple uninvadable types, including the type whereby an individual is a pure Kantian when interacting with individuals of the same type and applies the Kantian coefficient that is uninvadable under complete information with zero relatedness when interacting with a different typed individual. Overall, our model connects several concepts for analysing the evolution of behavior rules for strategic interactions that have been emphasized in different and sometimes isolated literatures.",

    "abstract": "Drug targets with human genetic evidence are expected to increase clinical success by at least two-fold. Yet, translating disease-associated genetic variants into functional knowledge remains a fundamental challenge of early drug discovery. A key issue is that, currently, the vast majority of complex disease associations cannot be cleanly mapped to a gene. Immune disease-associated variants are enriched within regulatory elements, such as distal enhancers, found in T cell-specific open chromatin regions. To identify the genes and thus the molecular programs modulated by these regulatory elements, we developed a CRISPRi-based single-cell functional screening approach in primary human CD4+ T cells. Our pipeline enables the interrogation of transcriptomic changes induced by the perturbation of regulatory elements at scale. We first optimised a highly efficient CRISPRi protocol in primary human CD4+ T cells via CROPseq vectors. Subsequently, we performed a proof-of-concept screen targeting 45 non-coding regulatory elements and 35 transcription start sites and profiled approximately 250,000 CD4+ T cell single-cell transcriptomes. We developed a bespoke analytical pipeline for element-to-gene (E2G) mapping and demonstrate that our method can identify both previously annotated and novel E2G links. Lastly, we integrated genetic association data for immune-related traits and demonstrate how our platform can aid in the identification of effector genes for GWAS loci.",

    "abstract": "Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (SV-AUC) is an indispensable tool for the study of particle size distributions in biopharmaceutical industry, for example, to characterize protein therapeutics and vaccine products. In particular, the diffusion-deconvoluted sedimentation coefficient distribution analysis, in the software SEDFIT, has found widespread applications due to its relatively high resolution and sensitivity. However, a lack of available software compatible with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) has hampered the use of SV-AUC in this regulatory environment. To address this, we have created an interface for SEDFIT so that it can serve as an automatically spawned module with controlled data input through command line parameters and output of key results in files. The interface can be integrated in custom GMP compatible software, and in scripts that provide documentation and meta-analyses for replicate or related samples, for example, to streamline analysis of large families of experimental data, such as binding isotherm analyses in the study of protein interactions. To test and demonstrate this approach we provide a MATLAB script mlSEDFIT.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the second largest cause of cancer deaths in women. However, drug resistance and poor response to treatments are common. Thus, there is an unmet need to identify new treatments and effective lab-based drug testing methods. Here we established a novel 3-dimensional organoid method by co-culturing cancer cells with healthy endothelial cells for longer-term testing of new drug combinations that combat drug resistance. As a proof-of-concept we showed that paclitaxel efficacy can be improved by combining it with AKT inhibitors. In addition, we identified a new triple combination of paclitaxel, HER2 inhibitor, and IGF1R inhibitor, which is more effective in increasing cell death and reducing organoid growth. Interestingly, many IGF1R pathway members are upregulated in breast cancer patients, and high expression is associated with poor survival, indicating that IGF1R is an attractive therapeutic target. Overall, using this novel organoid method, we can mimic more accurate culture conditions and identify new targets to be tested in clinical trials. Our approach is applicable to various cancers to improve patients outcomes.",

    "abstract": "One of the ways in which cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF) influence the tumour-microenvironment (TME) is by releasing soluble factors to elicit responses in nearby cells. These factors may be released by modification of the extracellular matrix (ECM), secretion from intracellular compartments, or proteolytic cleavage from the cell surface. A major mediator of proteolytic processing of cell surface proteins is the  a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) family, commonly ADAM17. The role of ADAM17 in CAF, however, remains largely unknown.\n\nHere, we show that expression of ADAM17 was induced in normal oral fibroblasts (NOF) and CAF by exposure to oral cancer cell-derived conditioned medium and depletion of ADAM17 reduced the ability of CAF to promote cancer cell migration by negatively regulating cancer cell-associated N-cadherin. Proteomic analysis of ADAM17-depleted CAF revealed changes in the expression of pro-tumorigenic proteins, including fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). Inhibition of FGF2/FGFR1 signalling abrogated the pro-migratory effects of CAF by reducing cancer cell-associated N-cadherin, an effect rescued by addition of recombinant FGF2.\n\nTaken together, these results indicate a novel molecular mechanism underpinning cancer cell migration in which tumour-derived factors induce ADAM17 expression in CAF, thus initiating a feed-forward loop wherein CAF release FGF2 to stimulate N-cadherin-dependent cancer cell migration.",

    "abstract": "Optimal feedback control provides an abstract framework describing the architecture of the sensorimotor system without prescribing implementation details such as what coordinate system to use, how feedback is incorporated, or how to accommodate changing task complexity. We investigate how such details are determined by computational and physical constraints by creating a model of the upper limb sensorimotor system in which all connection weights between neurons, feedback, and muscles are unknown. By optimizing these parameters with respect to an objective function, we find that the model exhibits a preference for an intrinsic (joint angle) coordinate representation of inputs and feedback and learns to calculate a weighted feedforward and feedback error. We further show that complex reaches around obstacles can be achieved by augmenting our model with a path-planner based on via points. The path-planner revealed \"avoidance\" neurons that encode directions to reach around obstacles, and \"placement\" neurons that make fine-tuned adjustments to via point placement. Our results demonstrate the surprising capability of computationally constrained systems and highlight new characteristics of the sensorimotor system.",

    "abstract": "Increased vulnerability to stress is a major risk factor for the manifestation of several mood disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD). Despite the status of MDD as a significant donor to global disability, the complex integration of genetic and environmental factors that contribute to the behavioral display of such disorders has made a thorough understanding of related etiology elusive. Recent developments suggest that a brain-wide network approach is needed, taking into account the complex interplay of cell types spanning multiple brain regions. Single cell RNA-sequencing technologies can provide transcriptomic profiling at the single-cell level across heterogenous samples. Furthermore, we have previously used local field potential oscillations and machine learning to identify an electrical brain network that is indicative of a predisposed vulnerability state. Thus, this study combined single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) with electrical brain network measures of the stress-vulnerable state, providing a unique opportunity to access the relationship between stress network activity and transcriptomic changes within individual cell types. We found especially high numbers of differentially expressed genes between animals with high and low stress vulnerability brain network activity in astrocytes and glutamatergic neurons but we estimated that vulnerability network activity depends most on GABAergic neurons. High vulnerability network activity included upregulation of microglia and mitochondrial and metabolic pathways, while lower vulnerability involved synaptic regulation. Genes that were differentially regulated with vulnerability network activity significantly overlapped with genes identified as having significant SNPs by human GWAS for depression. Taken together, these data provide the gene expression architecture of a previously uncharacterized stress vulnerability brain state, enabling new understanding and intervention of predisposition to stress susceptibility.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=91 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/540705v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (38K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ebe036org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cd2131org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13e3519org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1100e62_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "GABAergic inhibitory neurons fundamentally shape the activity and plasticity of cortical circuits. A major subset of these neurons contains somatostatin (SOM); these cells play crucial roles in neuroplasticity, learning and memory in many brain areas including the hippocampus, and are implicated in several neuropsychiatric diseases and neurodegenerative disorders. Two main types of SOM-containing cells in area CA1 of the hippocampus are oriens-lacunosum-moleculare (OLM) cells and hippocampo-septal (HS) cells. These cell types show many similarities in their soma-dendritic architecture, but they have different axonal targets, display different activity patterns in vivo and are thought to have distinct network functions. However, a complete understanding of the functional roles of these interneurons requires a precise description of their intrinsic computational properties and their synaptic interactions. In the current study we generated, analyzed and make available several key datasets that enable a quantitative comparison of various anatomical and physiological properties of OLM and HS cells in mouse. The dataset includes detailed scanning electron microscopy-based 3-dimensional reconstructions of OLM and HS cells along with their excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. Combining this core dataset with other anatomical data, patch-clamp electrophysiology and compartmental modeling, we examined the precise morphological structure, inputs, outputs, and basic physiological properties of these cells. Our results highlight key differences between OLM and HS cells, particularly regarding the density and distribution of their synaptic inputs and mitochondria. For instance, we estimated that an OLM cell receives about 8300, whereas an HS cell about 14800 synaptic inputs, about 16% of which are GABAergic. Our data and models provide insight into the possible basis of the different functionality of OLM and HS cell types and supply essential information for more detailed functional models of these neurons and the hippocampal network.",

    "abstract": "Circadian clocks impose daily periodicities to behavior, physiology, and metabolism. This control is mediated by a central clock and by peripheral clocks, which are synchronized to provide the organism with a unified time through mechanisms that are not fully understood. Here, we characterized in Drosophila the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in coupling the central clock and the peripheral clock located in the prothoracic gland (PG), which together control the circadian rhythm of emergence of adult flies. The time signal from central clock neurons is transmitted via small neuropeptide F (sNPF) to neurons that produce the neuropeptide Prothoracicotropic Hormone (PTTH), which is then translated into circadian oscillations of Ca2+ concentration and daily changes in PTTH levels. Rhythmic PTTH signaling is required at the end of metamorphosis, and transmits time information to the PG by imposing a daily rhythm to the expression of the PTTH receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), TORSO, and of ERK phosphorylation, a key component of PTTH transduction. In addition to PTTH, we demonstrate that signaling mediated by other RTKs contribute to the rhythmicity of emergence. Interestingly, the ligand to one of these receptors (Pvf2), plays an autocrine role in the PG, which may explain why both central brain and PG clocks are required for the circadian gating of emergence. Our findings show that the coupling between the central and the PG clock is unexpectedly complex and involves several RTKs that act in concert, and could serve as a paradigm to understand how circadian clocks are coordinated.\n\nSignificance statementCircadian clocks impose daily periodicities to behavior, physiology, and metabolism, and are synchronized to provide the organism with a unified time through mechanisms that are poorly understood. In holometabolous insects, the circadian control of adult emergence depends on the coupling between the central clock and a peripheral clock located in the prothoracic gland (PG). Here we identify the cellular and molecular mechanism that transmits time information from the central clock to the PG clock. This process is unexpectedly complex and involves a number of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Such a mechanism may add robustness to the coupling between the 2 clocks and serve as a paradigm for understanding how circadian clocks are coordinated.",

We lack a systematic understanding of which effector domains regulate transcription robustly across genomic, cell-type, and DNA-binding domain (DBD) contexts. Here, we developed dCas9-mediated high-throughput recruitment (HT-recruit), a pooled screening method for quantifying effector function at endogenous targets, and tested effector function for a library containing 5092 nuclear protein Pfam domains across varied contexts. We find many effectors depend on target and DBD contexts, such as HLH domains that can act as either activators or repressors. We then confirm these findings and further map context dependencies of effectors drawn from unannotated protein regions using a larger library containing 114,288 sequences tiling chromatin regulators and transcription factors. To enable efficient perturbations, we select effectors that are potent in diverse contexts, and engineer (1) improved ZNF705 KRAB CRISPRi tools to silence promoters and enhancers, and (2) a compact human activator combination NFZ for better CRISPRa and inducible circuit delivery. Together, this effector-by-context functional map reveals context-dependence across human effectors and guides effector selection for robustly manipulating transcription.",

    "abstract": "We consider how a population responds to directional selection on standing variation, with no new variation from recombination or mutation. Initially, there are N individuals with trait values z1, ..., zN ; the fitness of individual i is proportional to [Formula]. The initial values are drawn from a distribution{psi} with variance V0; we give examples of the Laplace and Gaussian distributions. When selection is weak relative to drift [Formula], variance decreases exponentially at rate 1/N ; since the increase in mean in any generation equals the variance, the expected net change is just NV0, which is the same as Robertsons (1960) prediction for a sexual population. In contrast, when selection is strong relative to drift [Formula], the net change can be found by approximating the establishment of alleles by a branching process in which each allele competes independently with the population mean and the fittest allele to establish is certain to fix. Then, if the probability of survival to time [Formula] of an allele with value z is P (z), with mean [Formula], the winning allele is the fittest of [Formula] survivors drawn from a distribution [Formula]. When N is large, there is a scaling limit which depends on a single parameter [Formula]; the expecte d ultimate change is [Formula] for a Gaussian distribution, and [Formula] for a Laplace distribution (where [W]is the product log function). This approach also reveals the variability of the process, and its dynamics; we show that in the strong selection regime, the expected genetic variance decreases as [~] t-3 at large times. We discuss how these results may be related to selection on standing variation that is spread along a linear chromosome.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a non-reversable condition that causes stiffening and narrowing of the pulmonary arteries. Many factors have been correlated with the initiation of pulmonary vascular remodeling in PAH. Female patients are more susceptible to, but have increased survival for, PAH, which the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. This study focuses on human pulmonary arterial adventitial fibroblast (hPAAF) activation, which increases production of extracellular matrix proteins and microenvironmental stiffness in the pulmonary arteries. Here, we employed soft hydrogels that were dynamically stiffened to observe how the age and sex of human serum influenced hPAAF activation in response to microenvironmental stiffening. Results showed female and male cells responded differently to increases in microenvironmental stiffness and serum composition. Female hPAAF activation was relatively high on both soft and stiffened hydrogels, with little difference in activation between the two conditions, unless cultured in younger (age < 50) female serum. Male hPAAFs were less activated than female cells on soft hydrogels and less responsive to increases in microenvironmental stiffness regardless of serum composition. Increased circulating sex-hormone concentrations decreased activation on soft hydrogels, while increasing activation on stiffened hydrogels. Male-cell activation was highly influenced by progesterone, which was measured to be high in the commercially available fetal bovine serum tested here. Collectively, these results suggest that it may be possible to model the estrogen paradox observed in PAH in vitro and that it is critical for researchers to report cell sex and serum source when conducting in vitro experimentation.",
