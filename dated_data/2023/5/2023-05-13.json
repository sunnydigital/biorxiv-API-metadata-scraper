    "abstract": "Understanding and controlling microbial adhesion is an important biomedical problem. However, many properties of the adhesion process of bacteria are still unknown, for example the distribution of adhesive strength over the cell wall. While a patchy colloid model for adhesion has been developed recently for Gram-negative Escherichia coli cells, a comparable model for Grampositive cells is unknown. Here, we use single-cell force spectroscopy to measure the adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus at different positions on tailored surfaces. We find heterogeneous adhesion profiles with varying degrees of intensity. By comparing these results to simulations, we find that locally increased adhesion can be explained by several distinct spots of high adhesion capabilities, similar to the patchy colloid model. Only for the underlying profile without local adhesive spots simple geometric considerations are insufficient. Rather, strong angle-dependent molecule-substratum interactions are necessary to explain the bathtub-like adhesion profiles seen for Staphylococcus aureus on a sinusoidal surface. We discuss implications of our results for the development of new materials and the design and analysis of future studies.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCrowding is the failure to recognize an object due to surrounding clutter. Our visual crowding survey measured 13 crowding distances (or \"critical spacings\") twice in each of 50 observers. The survey included three eccentricities (0, 5, and 10 deg), four cardinal meridians, two orientations (radial and tangential), and two fonts (Sloan and Pelli). The survey also tested foveal acuity, twice. Remarkably, fitting a two-parameter model, the well- known Bouma law -- crowding distance grows linearly with eccentricity -- explains 82% of the variance for all 13 x 50 measured log crowding distances, cross-validated. An enhanced Bouma law, with factors for meridian, crowding orientation, target kind, and observer, explains 94% of the variance, again cross-validated. These additional factors reveal several asymmetries, consistent with previous reports, which can be expressed as crowding- distance ratios: 0.62 horizontal:vertical, 0.79 lower:upper, 0.78 right:left, 0.55 tangential:radial, and 0.78 Sloan font:Pelli font. Across our observers, peripheral crowding is independent of foveal crowding and acuity. Evaluation of the Bouma factor b (the slope of the Bouma law) as a biomarker of visual health would be easier if there were a way to compare results across crowding studies that use different methods. We define a standardized Bouma factor b that corrects for differences from Boumas 25 choice alternatives, 75% threshold criterion, and linearly symmetric flanker placement. For radial crowding on the right meridian, the standardized Bouma factor b is 0.24 for this study, 0.35 for Bouma (1970), and 0.30 for the geometric mean across five representative modern studies, including this one, showing good agreement across labs, including Boumas. We found that guaranteeing fixation by gaze-contingent display halved the standard deviation across observers of the estimated log b. The reduction in standard deviation is explained by a \"peeking\" model in which the observer looked near an anticipated target location in 50% of unmonitored-fixation trials. Individual differences are robust, as evidenced by the much larger 0.08 SD of log b across observers than the 0.03 SD of test-retest within observers. Crowdings ease of measurement enhances its promise as a biomarker for dyslexia and visual health.",

    "abstract": "Central tolerance ensures autoreactive T cells are eliminated or diverted to the regulatory T cell lineage, thus preventing autoimmunity. To undergo central tolerance, thymocytes must enter the medulla to test their TCRs for autoreactivity against the diverse self-antigens displayed by antigen presenting cells (APCs). While CCR7 is known to promote thymocyte medullary entry and negative selection, our previous studies implicate CCR4 in these processes, raising the question of whether CCR4 and CCR7 play distinct or redundant roles in central tolerance. Here, synchronized positive selection assays, 2-photon timelapse microscopy, and quantification of TCR-signaled apoptotic thymocytes, demonstrate that CCR4 and CCR7 promote medullary accumulation and central tolerance of distinct post-positive selection thymocyte subsets. CCR4 is upregulated within hours of positive selection signaling and promotes medullary entry and clonal deletion of immature post-positive selection thymocytes. In contrast, CCR7 is expressed several days later and is required for medullary localization and negative selection of mature thymocytes. In addition, CCR4 and CCR7 differentially enforce self-tolerance, with CCR4 enforcing tolerance to self-antigens presented by activated APCs, which express CCR4 ligands. Our findings show that CCR7 expression is not synonymous with medullary localization and support a revised model of central tolerance in which CCR4 and CCR7 promote early and late stages of negative selection, respectively, via interactions with distinct APC subsets.",

    "abstract": "Across the transition from childhood to adolescence the human brain experiences profound functional changes, shifting from an organizational framework anchored within somatosensory/motor and visual regions into one that is balanced through interactions with later-maturing aspects of association cortex1-3. Here, we provide consistent evidence linking this profile of large-scale functional reorganization to the development of attention network connectivity across independent datasets4,5. We demonstrate that maturational changes in cortical organization are preferential to the salience/ventral attention network6-9 with heightened degree centrality and within-network connectivity, while connectivity within these network-linked vertices predicts cognitive ability such as fluid intelligence, perceptual reasoning and verbal ability10. Maturational refinement of the attention network closely links to the transition in cortical hierarchy, children with low ventral attention network connectivity exhibit adolescent-like topographical profiles, suggesting attentional systems may be critically important for understanding how brain functions are refined across development. These data highlight a core role for attention networks in supporting age-dependent shifts in cortical organization and cognition across childhood and adolescence, with the pruning in its between-network functional connections reflecting intricate interactions across multiple systems, rather than the segregation of an isolated network. The development of cortical hierarchy in children is driven by the ventral attention network, and the refinement of network connectivity within this system is linked to an accelerated pattern of cortical maturation.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell multimodal datasets have measured various characteristics of individual cells, enabling a deep understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms. However, multimodal data generation remains costly and challenging, and missing modalities happen frequently. Recently, machine learning approaches have been developed for data imputation but typically require fully matched multimodalities to learn common latent embeddings that potentially lack modality specificity. To address these issues, we developed an open-source machine learning model, Joint Variational Autoencoders for multimodal Imputation and Embedding (JAMIE). JAMIE takes single-cell multimodal data that can have partially matched samples across modalities. Variational autoencoders learn the latent embeddings of each modality. Then, embeddings from matched samples across modalities are aggregated to identify joint cross-modal latent embeddings before reconstruction. To perform cross-modal imputation, the latent embeddings of one modality can be used with the decoder of the other modality. For interpretability, Shapley values are used to prioritize input features for cross-modal imputation and known sample labels. We applied JAMIE to both simulation data and emerging single-cell multimodal data including gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and electrophysiology in human and mouse brains. JAMIE significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in general and prioritized multimodal features for imputation, providing potentially novel mechanistic insights at cellular resolution.",

It is widely accepted that the quantal content probability distribution is a binomial based on the number of ready-release SVs in the pre-synaptic terminal. But the latter number itself fluctuates due to its stochastic replenishment, hence the actual distribution of quantal content is unknown. We show that exact distribution of quantal content can be derived for general stochastic AP inputs in the steady-state. For fixed interval AP train, we prove that the distribution is a binomial, and corroborate our predictions by comparison with electrophysiological recordings from MNTB-LSO synapses of juvenile mice. For a Poisson train, we show that the distribution is non-binomial. Moreover, we find exact moments of the quantal content in the Poisson and other general cases, which may be used to obtain the model parameters from experiments.",

Glucocorticoids induce B-ALL cell apoptosis through activation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a ligand-induced nuclear receptor transcription factor (TF). We previously identified disruptions to glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-bound cis-regulatory elements controlling TLE1 expression in GC-resistant primary B-ALL cells from patients. TLE1 is a GC-response gene up-regulated by steroids and functions as a canonical Wnt signaling repressor. To better understand the mechanistic relationship between GC signaling and canonical Wnt signaling, we performed diverse functional analyses that identified extensive crosstalk and mutual antagonism between these two signaling pathways in B-ALL. We determined that crosstalk and antagonism was driven by the binding of GR and the canonical Wnt signaling TFs LEF1 and TCF7L2 to overlapping sets of cis-regulatory elements associated with genes impacting cell death and cell proliferation, and was further accompanied by overlapping and opposing transcriptional programs. Our data additionally suggest that cis-regulatory disruptions at TLE1 are linked to GC resistance through a dampening of the GC response and GC-mediated apoptosis via enhanced canonical Wnt signaling. As a result of the extensive genomic and gene regulatory connectivity between these two signaling pathways, our data supports the importance of canonical Wnt signaling in mediating GC resistance in B-ALL.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMicrobial communities usually harbor a mix of bacteria, archaea, phages, plasmids, and microeukaryotes. Phages, plasmids, and microeukaryotes, which are present in low abundance in microbial communities, have complex interactions with bacteria and play important roles in horizontal gene transfer and antibiotic resistance. However, due to the difficulty of identifying phages, plasmids, and microeukaryotes in microbial communities, our understanding of these minor classes lags behind that of bacteria and archaea. Recently, several classifiers have been developed to separate one or two minor classes from bacteria and archaea in metagenome assemblies, but none can classify all of the four classes simultaneously. Moreover, existing classifiers have low precision on minor classes.\n\nResultsWe developed for the first time a classifier called 4CAC that is able to identify phages, plasmids, microeukaryotes, and prokaryotes simultaneously from metagenome assemblies. 4CAC generates an initial four-way classification using several sequence length-adjusted XGBoost algorithms and further improves the classification using the assembly graph. Evaluation on simulated and real metagenome datasets demonstrates that 4CAC substantially outperforms existing classifiers and combinations thereof on short reads. On long reads, it also shows an advantage unless the abundance of the minor classes is very low. 4CAC runs 1-2 orders of magnitude faster than the other classifiers.\n\nConclusions4CAC is the first four-class classifier that is able to identify phages, plasmids, microeukaryotes, and prokaryotes simultaneously from metagenome assemblies. Evaluation of 4CAC on simulated and real metagenome assemblies demonstrated that it outperforms the existing classifiers in most cases. 4CAC is an easy-to-use software and is also by far the fastest.

The loss of Nr2f2 results in ectopic CA1/CA3 domains in the ventral hippocampus. The deficiency of Nr2f1 leads to the failed specification of dorsal CA1, among which there are place cells. The deletion of both Nr2f genes causes almost agenesis of the hippocampus with abnormalities of trisynaptic circuit and adult neurogenesis. Moreover, Nr2f1/2 may cooperate to guarantee appropriate morphogenesis and function of the hippocampus by regulating the Lhx5-Lhx2 axis.

Recent approaches to this problem have attempted to extract information about tumour growth by integrating multiscale experimental measurements, such as longitudinal cell counts and gene expression data. In the present study, we investigated the performance of several mathematical models of tumour growth, including classical logistic, fractional and novel multiscale models, in terms of quantifying in-vitro tumour growth in the presence and absence of therapy. We further examined the effect of genes associated with changes in chemosensitivity in cell death rates. State-of-the-art Bayesian inference, likelihood maximisation and uncertainty quantification techniques allowed a thorough evaluation of model performance. The results suggest that the classical single-cell population model (SCPM) was the best fit for the untreated and low-dose treatment conditions, while the multiscale model with a cell death rate symmetric with the expression profile of OCT4 (SymSCPM) yielded the best fit for the high-dose treatment data. Further identifiability analysis showed that the multiscale model was both structurally and practically identifiable under the condition of known OCT4 expression profiles. Overall, the present study demonstrates that model performance can be improved by incorporating multiscale measurements of tumour growth.",

We examined an agronomic experiment in a crop field of arid soils under drip irrigation in Huacho (Peru) using a commercial variety of sweet corn. The treatments were two levels of nitrogen (90 and 180 kg N ha-1), one or two applications to the foliage of a native strain of Azospirillum sp. (1 x 108 CFU/mL) and a control treatment only with nitrogen fertilizer. Eleven agronomic variables related to productive aspects were evaluated, performing statistical analysis and the comparison of treatment means. The inoculation with Azospirillum sp. did not significantly (p> 0.05) affect the total weight of ears, the number of ears per plant and the number of male flowers, but it significantly (p< 0.05) influenced the grain yield per hectare, survival of plants, the weight of grain per plant, diameter and length of the cob. In some productive characteristics of sweet corn cv\"Pardo\", a significant effect was found by inoculation with Azospirillum sp., surpassing in grain yield the control only with nitrogen fertilization, suggesting that it is possible to complement the application of nitrogen to the soil through the inoculation of this strain, replacing up to 50% of the levels of fertilizer application since the B/C ratio increased.",

    "abstract": "Visual motion drives smooth pursuit eye movements through a sensory-motor decoder that uses multiple parallel components and neural pathways to transform the population response in extrastriate area MT into movement. We evaluated the decoder by challenging pursuit in monkeys with reduced motion reliability created by reducing coherence of motion in patches of dots. Reduced dot coherence caused deficits in both the initiation of pursuit and steady-state tracking, revealing the paradox of steady-state eye speeds that fail to accelerate to target speed in spite of persistent image motion. We recorded neural responses to reduced dot coherence in MT and found a decoder that transforms MT population responses into eye movements. During pursuit initiation, decreased dot coherence reduces MT population response amplitude without changing the preferred speed at the peak of the population response. The successful decoder reproduces the measured eye movements by multiplication of (i) the estimate of target speed from the peak of the population response with (ii) visual-motor gain based on the amplitude of the population response. During steady-state tracking, the decoder that worked for pursuit initiation failed. It predicted eye acceleration to target speed even when monkeys eye speeds were steady at a level well below target speed. We can account for the effect of dot coherence on steady-state eye speed if sensorymotor gain also modulates the eye velocity positive feedback that normally sustains perfect steadystate tracking. Then, poor steady-state tracking persists because of balance between deceleration caused by low positive feedback gain and acceleration driven by MT.",

    "abstract": "Decision-making forms a central bottleneck to most of our tasks, one that people often experience as costly. To mitigate these costs, previous work has proposed adjusting ones threshold for deciding (e.g., satisficing) to avoid over-deliberating. Here, we test an alternative solution to these costs, one that targets the basis for most choice costs: the fact that choosing one option sacrifices others (mutual exclusivity). Across 4 studies (N = 385), we test whether this tension can be relieved by framing choices as inclusive (allowing more than one option from a set, similar to a buffet), and whether doing so improves decision-making and the experience thereof. We find that inclusivity makes choices more efficient, because of its unique impact on the level of competition between potential responses as participants accumulate information for each of their options (resulting in a more \"race\"-like decision process). We find that inclusivity also reduces the subjective costs associated with choice, making people feel less conflicted in conditions where it was hard to choose which good option to acquire or which bad option to get rid of. These inclusivity benefits were distinct from those achieved when trying to merely reduce deliberation (e.g., tightening ones deadline), which we show can in some cases lead to similar increases in efficiency but only carry the potential to diminish not improve the experience of choosing. This work collectively provides key mechanistic insights into the conditions under which decision making is most costly, and a novel approach aimed at mitigating those costs.",

    "abstract": "Light-harvesting complex stress-related protein 3 (LHCSR3) expression is observed in various protoxidizing conditions like high light and nutrient starvation. LHCSR3 expression is essential for energy-dependent quenching (qE), whereas its role under nutrient starvation is elusive. It is also unclear how nutrient starvation can induce LHCSR3 expression under subsaturating light intensities. To study the role of LHCSR3 under nutrient starvation, the C. reinhardtii cells are grown under osmotic stress that would prevent water uptake; therefore same holds true for soluble nutrients in the medium. In this work, we have shown that LHCSR3 expression can occur under osmotic stress and subsaturating light intensities, whereas it does not elicit qE. Further examination of thylakoid membrane architecture from wild-type and npq4 mutant grown under nutrient starvation revealed that LHCSR3 expression affects the interaction between the PSII core with its peripheral LHCII antenna and possibly can prevent excitation energy transfer. Thylakoid lumen acidification is essential for the expression and function of LHCSR3. Under saturating light intensities, this is achieved by the increased rate of photosynthetic electron flow coupled with proton translocation into the thylakoid lumen. Whereas, under nutrient starvation, the reports of LHCSR3 expression also showed reduced photosynthetic electron flow. Therefore, an alternative mechanism should exist for developing the proton gradient. We observed the downregulation of chloroplast (cp) ATP synthase activity and its abundance under osmotic stress, suggesting the role of (cp) ATP synthase in thylakoid lumen acidification under reduced photosynthetic electron flow. This observation is supported by the expression of LHCSR3 in (cp) ATP-synthase mutant atpF upon exposure to moderate light intensity. This study proposes that the mechanism of LHCSR3 expression and its functionality can vary with the type of photooxidizing stress.",

    "abstract": "Myosins are important motor proteins that associate with the actin cytoskeleton. Structurally, myosins function as heteromeric complexes where smaller light chains, such as calmodulin (CaM), bind to isoleucine-glutamine (IQ) domains in the neck regions to facilitate mechano-enzymatic activity. We recently identified Arabidopsis CaM-like (CML) proteins, CML13 and CML14 as interactors of proteins containing multiple IQ domains, including a member of the myosin VIII class. Here, using in vivo and in vitro assays we demonstrate that CaM, CML13, and CML14 bind the neck region of all four Arabidopsis myosin VIII isoforms. Among ten CML isoforms tested for in planta binding to myosins VIIIs, CaM, CML13, and CML14 gave the strongest signals using in planta split-luciferase protein-interaction assays. In vitro, recombinant CaM, CML13, and CML14 showed specific, high-affinity, calcium-independent binding to the IQ domains of myosin VIIIs. Subcellular localization analysis indicated that CaM, CML13, and CML14 co-localized to plasma membrane-bound puncta when co-expressed with RFP-myosin fusion proteins containing IQ- and tail-domains of myosin VIIIs. In addition, in vitro actin-motility assays using recombinant myosin holoenzymes demonstrated that CaM, CML13, and CML14 function as light chains for myosin VIIIs. Collectively, our data indicate that Arabidopsis CML13 and CML14 are novel myosin VIII light chains.\n\nHighlightMyosins are key proteins in the plant cytoskeleton, but the identity of their light chain components is unknown. Here, we show that calmodulin-like proteins function as novel myosin light chains.",

    "abstract": "DNA is organized into chromatin-like structures, which support the maintenance and regulation of genomes. A unique and poorly understood form of DNA packaging exists in chloroplasts, which are endosymbiotic organelles responsible for photosynthesis. Chloroplast genomes, together with associated proteins, form membraneless structures known as nucleoids. The internal arrangement of the nucleoid, molecular mechanisms of DNA packaging, and connections between nucleoid structure and gene expression remain mostly unknown. We show that Arabidopsis thaliana chloroplast nucleoids have a unique organization driven by DNA binding to the thylakoid membranes. DNA associated with the membranes has high protein occupancy, reduced DNA accessibility, and is highly transcribed. In contrast, genes with low levels of transcription are further away from the membranes, have lower protein occupancy, and higher DNA accessibility. Disruption of transcription at specific genes in sigma factor mutants causes a corresponding reduction in membrane association, indicating that RNA polymerase activity causes DNA tethering to the membranes. We propose that transcription organizes the chloroplast nucleoid into a transcriptionally active membrane-associated core and a less active periphery.",

Here, using knock-down (KD) or knock-out (KO), we combine the inactivation of the Arp2/3 inhibitory protein Arpin, the Arp2/3 subunit ARPC1A and the WAVE complex subunit, CYFIP2, that all enhance the polymerization of cortical branched actin (CBA). Inactivation of the 3 CBA negative regulators increases migration persistence of human breast MCF10A cells, and of endodermal cells in the zebrafish embryo, significantly more than any single or double inactivation. In the triple KO, but not triple KD cells, the \"super-migrator\" phenotype was associated with a heterogenous down-regulation of vimentin expression and a lack of coordination in collective behaviors, such as wound healing and acinus morphogenesis. Re-expression of vimentin in triple KO cells restored the normal persistence of single cell migration to a large extent, suggesting that vimentin down-regulation is one of the adjustments in gene expression through which the super-migrator phenotype is stably maintained in triple KO cells. Constant excessive production of branched actin at the cell cortex thus commits cells into a motile state through changes in gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Tissue-specific endopolyploidy is widespread among plants and animals and its role in organ development and function has long been investigated. In insects, the fat body cells of sexually mature females produce substantial amounts of egg yolk precursor proteins (vitellogenins) and exhibit high polyploid levels, which is considered crucial for boosting egg production. Termites are social insects with a reproductive division of labor, and the fat bodies of mature termite queens exhibit higher ploidy levels than those of other females. The fat bodies of mature termite queens are known to be histologically and cytologically specialized in protein synthesis. However, the relationship between such modifications and polyploidization remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the relationship among cell type, queen maturation, and ploidy levels in the fat body of the termite Reticulitermes speratus. We first confirmed that the termite fat body consists of two types of cells, that is, adipocytes, metabolically active cells, and urocytes, urate- storing cells. Our ploidy analysis using flow cytometry has shown that the fat bodies of actively reproducing queens had more polyploid cells than those of newly emerged and pre-reproductive queens, regardless of the queen phenotype (adult or neotenic type). Using image-based analysis, we found that adipocytes became polyploid during queen differentiation and subsequent sexual maturation. These results suggest that polyploidization in the termite queen fat body is associated with sexual maturation and is regulated in a cell type-specific manner. Our study findings have provided novel insights into the development of insect fat bodies and provide a basis for future studies to understand the functional importance of polyploidy in the fat bodies of termite queens.",

    "abstract": "Maintenance of the polarity of the epithelial cells facing the lumen of the small intestine is crucial to ensure the vectorial absorption of nutrients as well as the integrity of the apical brush border and the intestinal barrier. Polarized vesicular trafficking plays a key role in this process, and defective transport due to mutations in apical trafficking-related genes has been shown to affect nutrient absorption. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that downregulation of the polarized sorting clathrin adaptor AP-1B led to both epithelial polarity and proliferation defects in the mouse intestine. This enlightened a new function of polarized trafficking in the gut epithelium and a novel link between trafficking, polarity, and proliferation. Here, using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutation of the AP-1B coding gene Ap1m2 in mouse intestinal organoids, we uncovered a novel proliferation pathway controlled by AP-1B. We showed that the polarity defects induced by Ap1m2 mutations led to a defective apical targeting of both Rab11+ apical recycling endosomes and of the polarity determinant Cdc42. Moreover, we showed that these polarity defects were accompanied by an induction of YAP and EGFR/mTOR-dependent proliferation pathways. Finally, we showed that AP-1B additionally controlled a proliferation-independent differentiation pathway towards the secretory lineage. Overall, our results highlighted the pleiotropic roles played by AP-1B in the homeostasis of the gut epithelium.",

Hydra vulgaris, a freshwater cnidarian with only eleven neuronal cell types, serves as a tractable model system for studying state-dependent behaviors.

By modeling this behavior as a set of three sequences - head orientation, jump distance, and jump rate -we demonstrate that the satiety state only affects the rate of the animal jumping to a new position, while the orientation and jump distance are unaffected. These findings yield insights into how internal states in a simple organism, Hydra, affect specific elements of a behavior, and offer general principles for studying the relationship between state-dependent behaviors and their underlying molecular mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Deciphering the brains structure-function relationship is key to understanding the neuronal mechanisms underlying perception and cognition. The cortical column, a vertical organization of neurons with similar functions, is a classic example of primate neocortex structure-function organization. While columns have been identified in primary sensory areas using parametric stimuli, their prevalence across higher-level cortex is debated. A key hurdle in identifying columns is the difficulty of characterizing complex nonlinear neuronal tuning, especially with high-dimensional sensory inputs. Here, we asked whether area V4, a mid-level area of the macaque visual system, is organized into columns. We combined large-scale linear probe recordings with deep learning methods to systematically characterize the tuning of >1,200 V4 neurons using in silico synthesis of most exciting images (MEIs), followed by in vivo verification. We found that the MEIs of single V4 neurons exhibited complex features like textures, shapes, or even high-level attributes such as eye-like structures. Neurons recorded on the same silicon probe, inserted orthogonal to the cortical surface, were selective to similar spatial features, as expected from a columnar organization. We quantified this finding using human psychophysics and by measuring MEI similarity in a non-linear embedding space, learned with a contrastive loss. Moreover, the selectivity of the neuronal population was clustered, suggesting that V4 neurons form distinct functional groups of shared feature selectivity, reminiscent of cell types. These functional groups closely mirrored the feature maps of units in artificial vision systems, hinting at shared encoding principles between biological and artificial vision. Our findings provide evidence that columns and functional cell types may constitute universal organizing principles of the primate neocortex, simplifying the cortexs complexity into simpler circuit motifs which perform canonical computations.",

    "abstract": "Performing group analysis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data with linear mixed-effects (LME) models is challenging due to its large dimensionality and inherent multi-level covariance structure. In addition, as large-scale collaborative projects become commonplace in neuroimaging, data must increasingly be stored and analysed at different locations. In such settings, substantial overheads occur in terms of data transfer and coordination between participating research groups. In some cases, data cannot be pooled together due to privacy or regulatory concerns. In this work, we propose a decentralized LME model to perform a large-scale analysis of data from different collaborations without sharing or pooling. This method is efficient as it overcomes the hurdles of data privacy for sharing and has lower bandwidth and memory requirements for analysis than the centralized modeling approach. We evaluate our model using features extracted from structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data. Results highlight gray matter reductions in the temporal lobe/insula and medical front regions demonstrate the correctness of decentralized LME models. Our analysis also demonstrates that decentralized LME models achieve similar performance compared to the models trained with all the data in one location. We also implement the decentralized LME approach in COINSTAC, a decentralized platform for federating neuroimaging analysis, to demonstrate its value to the neuroimaging community.",

High-resolution electron microscopy and quantitative analyses reveal that release sites align with adhesion molecules, receptor clusters, and postsynaptic density (PSD) nanoblocks as a physical, transsynaptic, nano- alignment. Additionally, it has been determined that the PSDs contain different-sized, membrane-associated, subsynaptic protein nanoblocks. Furthermore, large nanoblocks are formed by small nanoblocks positioned close enough together. Lastly, the tomograms of synaptosomes allow us to detect the glutamate receptor-like particles by subtomogram averaging at resolutions of 24 [A] and 26 [A].

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe genetic underpinnings of late-onset Alzheimers disease (LOAD) are yet to be fully elucidated. Although numerous LOAD-associated loci have been discovered, the causal variants and their target genes remain largely unknown. Since the brain is composed of heterogenous cell subtypes, it is imperative to study the brain on a cell subtype specific level to explore the biological processes underlying LOAD.\n\nMethodsHere, we present the largest parallel single-nucleus (sn) multi-omics study to simultaneously profile gene expression (snRNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility (snATAC-seq) to date, using nuclei from 12 normal and 12 LOAD brains. We identified cell subtype clusters based on gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiles and characterized cell subtype-specific LOAD-associated differentially expressed genes (DEGs), differentially accessible peaks (DAPs) and cis co-accessibility networks (CCANs).\n\nResultsIntegrative analysis defined disease-relevant CCANs in multiple cell subtypes and discovered LOAD-associated cell subtype specific candidate cis regulatory elements (cCREs), their candidate target genes, and trans-interacting transcription factors (TFs), some of which were LOAD-DEG, for example, ELK1 in excitatory neurons (Exc1) and KLF13 and JUN, found in multiple cell subtypes. Finally, we focused on a subset of cell subtype-specific CCANs that overlap known LOAD-GWAS regions and catalogued putative functional SNPs changing the affinities of TF motifs within LOAD-cCREs linked to LOAD-DEGs including, APOE and MYO1E in a specific subtype of microglia and BIN1 in a subpopulation of oligodendrocytes.\n\nConclusionsTo our knowledge, this study represents the most comprehensive systematic interrogation to date of regulatory networks and the impact of genetic variants on gene dysregulation in LOAD at a cell subtype resolution. Our findings revealed crosstalk between epigenetic, genomic, and transcriptomic determinates of LOAD pathogenesis and define catalogues of candidate genes, cCREs, and variants involved in LOAD genetic etiology and the cell subtypes in which they act to exert their pathogenic effects. Overall, these results suggest that cell subtype-specific cis-trans interactions between regulatory elements and TFs, and the genes dysregulated by these networks contribute to the development of LOAD.",

    "abstract": "Autosomal dominant variants in LRP10 have been identified in patients with Lewy body diseases (LBDs), including Parkinsons disease (PD), Parkinsons disease-dementia (PDD), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Nevertheless, there is little mechanistic insight into the role of LRP10 in disease pathogenesis. In the brains of non-demented individuals, LRP10 is typically expressed in non-neuronal cells like astrocytes and neurovasculature, but in idiopathic and genetic cases of PD, PDD, and DLB it is also present in -synuclein-positive neuronal Lewy bodies. These observations raise the questions of what leads to the accumulation of LRP10 in Lewy bodies and whether a possible interaction between LRP10 and -synuclein plays a role in disease pathogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that wild-type LRP10 is secreted via extracellular vesicles (EVs) and can be internalised via clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Additionally, we show that LRP10 secretion is highly sensitive to autophagy inhibition, which induces the formation of atypical LRP10 vesicular structures in neurons in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived midbrain-like organoids (hMLOs). Furthermore, we show that LRP10 overexpression leads to a strong induction of monomeric -synuclein secretion, together with time-dependent, stress-sensitive changes in intracellular -synuclein levels. Interestingly, patient-derived astrocytes carrying the c.1424+5G>A LRP10 variant secrete aberrant high-molecular-weight species of LRP10 in EV-free media fractions. Finally, we show that the truncated LRP10splice protein binds to wild-type LRP10, reduces LRP10 wild-type levels, and antagonises the regulatory effect of LRP10 on -synuclein levels and distribution. Together, this work provides initial evidence for a functional role of LRP10 in LBDs by regulating intra- and extracellular -synuclein levels, and pathogenic mechanisms linked to the disease-associated c.1424+5G>A LRP10 variant, pointing towards potentially important disease mechanisms in LBDs.",

    "abstract": "Many glandular epithelia are mainly composed of basal cells and luminal cells, including the prostate gland. Adult prostate basal and luminal cells are independently self-sustained by unipotent stem cells that can reactivate multipotency under prostate inflammation and carcinogenesis contexts. However, the defined basal stem cell populations responsible for prostate regeneration and their cell fates in prostate homeostasis, inflammation and carcinogenesis remain unclear. Using a genetic proliferation tracer (ProTracer) system, we found that basal cells exhibited extensive cell loss and proliferation during androgen-mediated prostate regression and regeneration, respectively. A rare intermediate basal cell population that expresses luminal cell markers (Nkx3.1 and Pbsn) (termed Basal-B) and a large basal cell population (termed Basal-A) were identified in mouse prostates by single-cell RNA sequencing. Basal-B cells exhibited a greater capacity for organoid formation and luminal cell differentiation in vitro. Genetic lineage tracing using dual recombinases showed that prostate homeostasis and regeneration are not driven by specific basal cell types. Fate-mapping results showed that Basal-B cells had a greater tendency to generate luminal cells under bacteria-induced prostate inflammation. Deletion of Pten in basal cells resulted in Basal-A-to-Basal-B-to-luminal transition and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Moreover, the human Basal-B-cell population was significantly increased in human benign prostate hyperplasia and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia samples compared with normal prostate samples. This study identifies intermediate Basal-B cells as a potential stem cell population and provides genetic evidence of prostate basal cell lineage plasticity under physiological and pathological contexts.",

    "abstract": "An animals ability to regrow lost tissues or structures can vary greatly during its life cycle. The annelid Capitella teleta exhibits posterior, but not anterior, regeneration as juveniles and adults. In contrast, embryos display only limited replacement of specific tissues. To investigate when during development C. teleta becomes capable of regeneration, we assessed the extent to which larvae can regenerate. We hypothesized that larvae exhibit intermediate regeneration potential and demonstrate some features of juvenile regeneration, but do not successfully replace all lost structures. Both anterior and posterior regeneration potential of larvae were evaluated following amputation. Wound sites were analyzed for re-epithelialization, cell proliferation by EdU incorporation, stem cell and differentiation marker expression by in situ hybridization, presence of neurites and muscle fibers by immunohistochemistry and phalloidin staining respectively, and regrowth of structures. Wound healing occurred within 6 hours of amputation for both anterior and posterior amputations. Cell proliferation at both wound sites was observed for up to 7 days following amputation. In addition, the stem cell marker vasa was expressed at anterior and posterior wound sites. However, growth of new tissue was observed only in posterior amputations. Neurites from the ventral nerve cord were also observed at posterior wound sites. De novo ash expression in the ectoderm of anterior wound sites indicated neuronal cell specification, although the absence of elav expression indicated an inability to progress to neuronal differentiation. In rare instances, cilia and eyes reformed. Both amputations induced expanded expression of the myogenesis gene MyoD in pre-existing tissues. Our results indicate that amputated larvae complete early, but not late, stages of regeneration, indicating a gradual acquisition of regenerative ability in C. teleta. Furthermore, amputated larvae can metamorphose into burrowing juveniles, including those missing brain and anterior sensory structures. To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess regenerative potential of annelid larvae.",

    "abstract": "Transport tasks are simple tasks whose cost can be easily measured and that are thus well suited to test optimality hypotheses. Here we focus on a particular type of transport that occur when ants are clearing obstacles from their subterranean galleries. In the laboratory we studied how they extract an object from a gallery of various inclinations. We expected that if ants behave optimally, they should remove the object by the gallery extremity requiring the lower energetic effort. At the colony-level, we found that the obstacle was more often extracted by the lower end of the tube, even if this required a higher amount of mechanical work. At the individual level however, ants showed mechanically optimal pulling behaviours in 75% of cases. Our results suggest that individual ants take into account both the inclination of the gallery and the position of the obstacle in it to decide in which direction they pull. In addition, they seem to base their decision to release the obstacle on the relative effort they perceive while pulling. Using a simple simulation model, we argue that the suboptimal extraction bias observed at the colony-level can be explained by the sequential nature of the extraction task.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBinge alcohol drinking is a risk factor linked to numerous disease states including alcohol use disorder (AUD). While men binge drink more alcohol than women, this demographic gap is quickly shrinking, and preclinical studies demonstrate that females consistently consume more alcohol than males. Further, women are at increased risk for the co-expression of AUD with neuropsychiatric diseases such as anxiety and mood disorders. However, little is understood about chronic voluntary alcohol drinking and its long-term effects on behavior in females. Here, we sought to characterize sex differences in chronic binge drinking and the effects of protracted alcohol withdrawal on anxiety- and affective-related behaviors in males and females.\n\nMethodsWe assessed binge alcohol drinking patterns in male and female C57BL/6J mice using a modified Drinking in the Dark (DID) paradigm in which mice received home cage access to one bottle of 10% or 20% alcohol (EtOH) or water for 2 hrs per day on Days 1-3 and to two bottles (EtOH/H2O + H2O) for 24 hrs on Day 4 for eight weekly cycles. Mice were then tested for the effects of protracted abstinence on avoidance, affective, and compulsive behaviors.\n\nResultsFemale mice consistently consumed more alcohol than males, with a more robust sex difference for 20% than 10% EtOH. Higher alcohol intake in females was biased toward the early access period (2-4 hrs) but was not dependent on higher overall water/fluid intake. Alcohol preference was higher in 10% vs. 20% EtOH but there was no difference between sexes. Protracted alcohol abstinence decreased avoidance behavior (elevated plus maze, open field, novelty suppressed feeding) and increased compulsive behavior (marble burying) in females but not males, and there was no effect of alcohol history on stress coping and negative affective behaviors (sucrose preference, forced swim test, tail suspension) in either sex.\n\nConclusionFemale mice engaged in higher volume binge drinking than their male counterparts; further, protracted abstinence from chronic binge drinking resulted in a female-specific behavioral disinhibition that may be related to greater alcohol intake. These results have implications for sex-dependent alcohol drinking patterns and long-term negative neuropsychiatric/physiological health outcomes in humans.\n\nHighlightsO_LIFemale mice consistently consumed more alcohol than males, with a more robust sex difference in consuming high (20%) versus lower (10%) concentration alcohol.\nC_LIO_LIFemale alcohol intake was biased towards the first 2-hrs of each drinking session. While females consumed more water than males at the 24-hr timepoint, there was no difference in the first 2-hrs of drinking sessions suggesting elevated female alcohol intake is not driven by increased liquid consumption.\nC_LIO_LIAlcohol preference was elevated for 10% versus 20% alcohol but there was no difference between the sexes.\nC_LIO_LIProtracted alcohol abstinence decreased avoidance behavior and increased impulsivity in females only, with no effect in males.\nC_LIO_LIThere was no effect of protracted alcohol abstinence on anhedonia in either sex.\nC_LI\n\nSummaryThe overconsumption of alcohol is a widespread public health issue linked to numerous diseases and mental health issues including anxiety among others. Binge drinking, defined as having 4-5 drinks in a 2-hour period, is more common in men than women but that demographic gap is shrinking. Mice are commonly used as an animal model of alcohol consumption and binge drinking to study behaviors associated with/resulting from alcohol drinking. We found that female mice consume more alcohol compared to their male counterparts, and furthermore, that following long-term alcohol consumption and abstinence, females but not males displayed reduced anxiety and increased compulsive behavior. Although high levels of anxiety that remained sustained for long periods of time are considered to negatively affect mental/physical health, some amount of anxiety is healthy to reduce behaviors that may compromise well-being including potentially binge drinking. We propose that this behavioral outcome may denote increased risk-taking behavior and that the reduction of anxiety in females may lead to negative outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Spinal motor neurons (SMNs) are the primary target of degeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Degenerating motor neurons accumulate cytoplasmic TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) aggregates in most ALS cases. This SMN pathology can occur without mutation in the coding sequence of the TDP-43-encoding gene, TARDBP. Whether and how wild-type TDP-43 drives pathological changes in SMNs in vivo remain largely unexplored. In this study, we develop a two-photon calcium imaging setup in which tactile-evoked neural responses of motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord can be monitored using the calcium indicator GCaMP. We devise a piezo-assisted tactile stimulator that reproducibly evokes a brainstem descending neuron upon tactile stimulation of the head. A direct comparison between caudal primary motor neurons (CaPs) with or without TDP-43 overexpression in contiguous spinal segments demonstrates that CaPs overexpressing TDP-43 display attenuated Ca2+ transients during fictive escape locomotion evoked by the tactile stimulation. These results show that excessive amounts of TDP-43 protein reduce the neuronal excitability of SMNs and potentially contribute to asymptomatic pathological lesions of SMNs and movement disorders in patients with ALS.",

    "abstract": "The importance of sleep in memory consolidation is well-established, with the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 subregions playing a crucial role in this process. The current working hypothesis postulates that episodic memory traces captured during waking hours are replayed in the hippocampal CA1-CA3 areas and transferred to the cortex for long-term storage during sleep. While the entorhinal cortex provides sensory and spatial information primarily to the hippocampus via the dentate gyrus (DG), the DG has traditionally been regarded as a \"silent partner\" in memory consolidation. The transfer of captured memory traces from the DG to downstream hippocampal areas remains largely unknown. To investigate this, we used optical imaging tools to record neural activity in the DG during different sleep stages. Strikingly, we found that many of the DG cells are even more active during sleep than wakefulness and the populational activity in the DG slowly oscillates during non-REM (NREM) sleep. The cycles of this oscillatory activity coincided with microarousals and were tightly locked to brief serotonin (5-HT) bursts during NREM sleep. Pharmacological blockade of 5-HT1a receptors abolished the calcium oscillations in the DG. Furthermore, genetic knockdown of 5-HT1a receptors in the DG lead to memory impairment in spatial and contextual memory tasks. Together, our findings suggest that serotonin-driven infraslow calcium oscillations in the DG during NREM sleep are necessary for memory consolidation.",

By comparing gene set pathways reciprocally altered in depressed-state animals then reversed by ECS, we identified and validated neuro-inflammation as a candidate regulator of the antidepressant response. We further identified 56 novel candidate  antidepressant response genes in the ventral SGZ that may contribute to recovery, half of which have been implicated in human neuropsychiatric phenotypes.\n\nConclusionsElectroconvulsive stimuli reverse neuro-inflammation in a mouse model of depression.

    "abstract": "High throughput experimental approaches are increasingly allowing for the quantitative description of cellular and organismal phenotypes. Distilling these large volumes of complex data into meaningful measures that can drive biological insight remains a central challenge. In the quantitative study of development, for instance, one can resolve phenotypic measures for single cells onto their lineage history, enabling joint consideration of heritable signals and cell fate decisions. Most attempts to analyze this type of data, however, discard much of the information content contained within lineage trees. In this work we introduce a generalized metric, which we term the branch distance, that allows us to compare any two embryos based on phenotypic measurements in individual cells. This approach aligns those phenotypic measurements to the underlying lineage tree, providing a flexible and intuitive framework for quantitative comparisons between, for instance, Wild-Type (WT) and mutant developmental programs. We apply this novel metric to data on cell-cycle timing from over 1300 WT and RNAi-treated Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. Our new metric revealed surprising heterogeneity within this data set, including subtle batch effects in WT embryos and dramatic variability in RNAi-induced developmental phenotypes, all of which had been missed in previous analyses. Further investigation of these results suggests a novel, quantitative link between pathways that govern cell fate decisions and pathways that pattern cell cycle timing in the early embryo. Our work demonstrates that the branch distance we propose, and similar metrics like it, have the potential to revolutionize our quantitative understanding of organismal phenotype.",

    "abstract": "The socially monogamous prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) and promiscuous meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus) are closely related, but only prairie voles display long-lasting pair bonds, biparental care, and selective aggression towards unfamiliar individuals after pair bonding. These social behaviors in mammals are largely mediated by steroid hormone signaling in the social behavior network (SBN) of the brain. Hormone receptors are reproducible markers of sex differences that can provide more information than anatomy alone, and can even be at odds with anatomical dimorphisms. We reasoned that behaviors associated with social monogamy in prairie voles may emerge in part from unique expression patterns of steroid hormone receptors in this species, and that these expression patterns would be more similar across males and females in prairie than in meadow voles or the laboratory mouse. To obtain insight into steroid hormone signaling in the developing prairie vole brain, we assessed expression of estrogen receptor alpha (Esr1), estrogen receptor beta (Esr2), and androgen receptor (Ar) within the SBN, using in situ hybridization at postnatal day 14 in mice, meadow, and prairie voles. We found species-specific patterns of hormone receptor expression in the hippocampus and ventromedial hypothalamus, as well as species differences in the sex bias of these markers in the principal nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. These findings suggest the observed differences in gonadal hormone receptor expression may underlie species differences in the display of social behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Uniparental inheritance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is an evolutionary trait found in nearly all eukaryotes. In many species, including humans, the sperm mitochondria are introduced to the oocyte during fertilization1, 2. The mechanisms hypothesized to prevent paternal mtDNA transmission include ubiquitination of the sperm mitochondria and mitophagy3, 4. However, whether these mechanisms play a decisive role in paternal mtDNA elimination has been disputed5, 6. We found that mitochondria in human spermatozoa are devoid of mtDNA and lack mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), the major nucleoid protein required to protect, maintain, and transcribe mtDNA. During spermatogenesis, sperm cells express an isoform of TFAM, which retains the mitochondrial pre-sequence, ordinarily removed upon mitochondrial import. Phosphorylation of this pre-sequence prevents mitochondrial import and directs TFAM to the spermatozoon nucleus. TFAM re-localization from the mitochondria of spermatogonia to the spermatozoa nucleus directly correlates with the elimination of mitochondrial DNA, thereby explaining maternal inheritance in this species.",

We focus on data and metadata on genetic sequences posted on the two infrastructures in the period between January 2020 and January 2023, thus capturing a period of acute response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Through a variety of data science methods, we compare the extent to which the two portals succeeded in attracting data submissions from different countries around the globe and look at the ways in which submission rates varied over time. We go on to analyse the structure and underlying architecture of the infrastructures, reviewing how they organise data access and use, the types of metadata and version tracking they provide. Finally, we explore usage patterns of each infrastructure based on publications that mention the data to understand how data reuse can facilitate forms of diversity between institutions, cities, countries, and funding groups. Our findings reveal disparities in representation between the two infrastructures and differing practices in data governance and architecture. We conclude that both infrastructures offer useful lessons, with GISAID demonstrating the importance of expanding data submissions and representation, while the COVID-19 data portal offers insights into how to enhance data usability.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEndothelial senescence has been linked to several cardiovascular diseases. Dysregulation of proteins of the shelterin complex including TRF2 and TERF2IP causes senescence as it hampers DNA repair and cell proliferation. However, whether exposure to hyperglycemia interplays with proteins of the shelterin complex thus further dictates the senescent phenotype of endothelial cells (EC) remain to be explored.\n\nApproach and ResultsIn this study, we observed elevated levels of p21 and p53 in endothelial cells upon exposure to intermittent hyperglycemia. We also noted hyperglycemia exposure increased the levels of TERF2IP and TRF2, part of the shelterin complex. No change in the level of TRF1 and TPP1 were detected. Furthermore, a robust induction was detected in p65 level upon intermittent hyperglycemia challenge. ChIP-qPCR analysis revealed enhanced H3K4me3 enrichment in the promoter regions of p65, TERF2IP and TRF2. Inhibition of catalysis of H3K4me3 either by pharmacological inhibitor or siRNA-mediated knockdown of MLL2 attenuated increase in p65, TERF2IP and TRF2 levels including reversal of senescence markers p53 and p21. Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of NF-{kappa}B signaling also diminished abrupt increase in TERF2IP and TRF2 levels thus further reversed intermittent hyperglycemia-induced p53 and p21 levels. More importantly, co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization analysis revealed an interaction between nuclear p65 and MLL2 in EC stimulated with hyperglycemia. Further knockdown of either TERF2IP or TRF2 impaired intermittent hyperglycemia-induced p53 and p21 expression and associated endothelial senescence.\n\nConclusionOverall, the present study describes an interplay of epigenetics in defining NF-{kappa}B signaling and shelterin proteins expression which further govern the biochemical and functional state of endothelial senescence in hyperglycemic milieu.",

    "abstract": "Transient intramolecular interactions between transactivation domain and DNA binding domain of transcription factors are known to play important functional roles, including modulation of DNA binding affinity and specificity. Similar type of inter-domain interactions has recently been reported for the transcription factor ATF4/CREB-2, a key regulator of the Integral Stress Response. In the case of ATF4, transient coupling between the transactivation and basic-leucine zipper (bZip) domains regulates the degree of phosphorylation of the disordered transactivation domain achievable by the casein kinase CK2. Despite the crucial importance of these inter-domain interactions, their structural and molecular basis remain ill-determined. In the present study, we use a combination of experimental and computational techniques to determine the precise nature of the long-range contacts established between the transactivation and bZip domains of ATF4 prior to its association with protein partners and DNA. Solution NMR spectroscopy experiments reveal that the isolated bZip domain of ATF4 is predominantly disordered and display evidence of conformational dynamics over a wide range of timescales. These experimental findings are supported by multi-microsecond timescale all-atom molecular simulations that unveil the molecular basis of the long-range interactions between the transactivation and bZip domains of ATF4. We found that inter-domain coupling is primarily driven by disorder-mediated interactions between a leucine-rich region of the transactivation domain and the leucine-zipper region of the bZip domain. This study uncovers the role played by structural disorder in facilitating the formation of long-range intramolecular interactions that shape the conformational ensemble of ATF4 in a critical manner.",

    "abstract": "Paralogous proteins confer enhanced fitness to organisms via complex sequence-conformation codes that shape functional divergence, specialization, or promiscuity. Here, we resolve the underlying mechanism of promiscuous binding versus partial sub-functionalization in paralogs by studying structurally-identical Acyl-CoA Binding Proteins (ACBPs) from Plasmodium falciparum that serve as promising drug targets due to their high expression during the protozoan proliferative phase. Combining spectroscopic measurements, solution NMR, SPR and simulations on two of the paralogs, A16 and A749, we show that minor sequence differences shape nearly every local and global conformational feature. A749 displays a broader and heterogeneous native ensemble, weaker thermodynamic coupling and cooperativity, enhanced fluctuations, and a larger binding-pocket volume, compared to A16. Site-specific tryptophan probes signal a graded reduction in the sampling of substates in the holo form, which is particularly more apparent in A749, hinting at conformational-selection-like mechanism of binding. The paralogs exhibit a spectrum of binding affinities to different acyl-CoAs with A749, the more promiscuous and hence the likely ancestor, binding 1000-fold stronger to Lauroyl-CoA under physiological conditions. We thus demonstrate how minor sequence changes modulate the extent of long-range interactions and dynamics, effectively contributing to the molecular evolution of contrasting functional repertoires in paralogs.",

    "abstract": "Jamestown Canyon Virus (JCV), a negative-sense arbovirus, is increasingly common in the upper Midwest of the USA. Transmitted by a range of mosquito genera, JCV has at its primary amplifying host, white-tailed deer. Aedes aegypti is the major transmitter globally of the positive-sense viruses dengue (DENV), Zika, chikungunya, and Yellow Fever. Ae. aegyptis distribution, once confined to the tropics, is expanding, in part due to climate change. Wolbachia, an insect endosymbiont, limits the replication of co-infecting viruses inside insects. The release and spread of the symbiont into Ae. aegypti populations has been effective in reducing transmission of dengue and other viruses to humans. The mechanism of Wolbachia-mediated viral blocking in vectors is still poorly understood, however. Here we explored JCV infection potential in Ae. aegypti, the nature of the vectors immune response, and interactions with Wolbachia infection. We show that Ae. aegypti is highly competent for JCV, growing to substantial loads and rapidly reaching the saliva after an infectious blood meal. The mosquito immune system responds with strong induction of RNAi and JAK/STAT. Neither the direct effect of viral infection nor the energetic investment in immunity appears to affect mosquito longevity. Wolbachia infection blocked JCV only in the early stages of infection. Wolbachia-induced immunity was small compared to that of JCV, suggesting innate immune priming does not likely explain blocking. We propose two models to explain why Wolbachias blocking of negative-sense viruses like JCV may be less than that of positive-sense viruses, relating to the slowdown of host protein synthesis and the triggering of interferon-like factors like Vago. In conclusion, we highlight the risk for increased human disease with the predicted future overlap of Ae. aegypti and JCV ranges. We suggest that with moderate Wolbachia-mediated blocking and distinct biology, negative-sense viruses represent a fruitful comparator model to other viruses for understanding blocking mechanisms in mosquitoes.\n\nAuthor SummaryJamestown Canyon Virus (JCV), a newly emerging virus in North America, causes disease when it spills out of its wild mammal hosts into human populations via the bite of infected mosquitoes. We show that the mosquito Aedes aegypti, known for transmitting many viral pathogens to humans globally, and whose distribution is creeping northward in the USA toward regions where JCV is present, is likely able to transmit the virus. Wolbachia is an endosymbiotic bacterium being released in wild mosquito populations of mosquitoes because it limits the replication of human viruses inside the mosquito, limiting their transmission to humans. We show that Wolbachia has a limited ability to control the replication of JCV, which is likely because Wolbachia-induced antiviral response is quite weak, and unique aspects of negative-sense virus biology make them less susceptible to blocking. Our findings suggest that JCV may serve as a comparative model to positive-sense viruses like dengue in dissecting the mechanism of Wolbachia-mediated virus blocking. It also warns that shifting mosquito distributions, as expected under a changing climate, could bring JCV and Aedes mosquitoes into greater contact, potentially increasing the incidence of JCV in humans.",

Here, the cell surface characteristics of 31 strains of the ex-Lactobacillus genus were studied with the aim of evaluating their intrinsic abilities to serve as Pickering stabilizers of oil-in-water emulsions. About 77.42% of the tested strains demonstrated relatively highly negative zeta potential (-43.76 mV [&le;] zeta potential [&le;] -19.23 mV), while [~]58% of the strains demonstrated high cell surface hydrophobicity (microbial adhesion to hexadecane or MATH [&ge;] 30%).

Strains mainly demonstrated the type I surface feature ([~]45%), with most expressing strongly negative zeta potential and high surface hydrophobicity (zeta potential < -15 mV and MATH [&ge;] 30%, respectively). It appeared that the abundance of negative charge on the surfaces of ex-Lactobacillus cells positively influences surface hydrophobicity. Assessment of intrinsic Pickering stabilization potential using 12 selected strains indicated that four strains showed profound droplet size stability.

NbS have been applied to social-environmental challenges such as climate change and urbanization, but with diverse conceptualisations and applications that may impact their effectiveness and broader uptake. Much of the literature and implementation of NbS has emerged from Europe and though NbS use is rising in Australia, the context is unclear. This systematic quantitative literature review aims to understand Nature-based Solutions in an Australian context.\n\nHere we explore the meaning and practical uses of NbS in Australia, through three research questions: In Australia, 1) what is meant by the term  nature-based solutions? 2) what socio-ecological challenges do NbS aim to address and how? 3) are there gaps in NbS research and policy application that are hindering uptake of NbS approaches?\n\nWe show that in Australia, local governments are using NbS in urban planning to address the compounding challenges brought on by climate change in the human-environment interfaces. However, there is no consensus on NbS definitions and approaches, research is focussed on urban areas and problems, and NbS implementation follows a bottom-up, localised pattern without an integrated policy framework. Based on these findings, we provide recommendations for improving the implementation of NbS in Australia including: 1) a consistency of NbS definition and awareness of NbS approaches; 2) interdisciplinary and interdepartmental collaboration on NbS methods and effectiveness and; 3) an integrated policy framework supporting NbS nationwide.",

    "abstract": "The northern and southern marine faunas of the temperate Northeastern Pacific meet within California as part of one of the few eastern boundary upwelling ecosystems of the world. Traditionally, it is believed that Point Conception is the precise site of turnover between these two faunas due to sharp changes in oceanographic conditions. However, evidence from intraspecific phylogeography and species range terminals do not support this view, finding stronger biogeographic breaks elsewhere along the coast. Here I develop a new application of historical biogeographic approaches to uncover sites of transition between faunas without needing an a priori hypothesis of where these occur. I used this approach to determine whether the point of transition between northern and southern temperate faunas occurs at Point Conception or elsewhere within California. I also take advantage of expert-vetted latitudinal range data of California fish species from the 1970s and the 2020s to assess how biogeography could change with the backdrop of climate change. The site of turnover was found to occur near Point Conception, in concordance with the traditional view. I suggest that recent species- and population-level processes such as dispersal and speciation could be expected to give signals of different events from historical biogeography, possibly explaining the discrepancy across studies. Species richness of California has increased since the 1970s, mostly due to new species from Baja California. Range shifts under warming conditions will have the consequence of increasing the disparity between northern and southern faunas of California, creating a more divergent biogeography.",

    "abstract": "Physical activity is regulated by a variety of genetic molecules. However, the pathways through which those molecules work to regulate activity is largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to gather the known genetic molecules that are associated with activity regulation and define overall upstream regulator pathways through which these molecules work. We conducted a systematic review to gather all available published datasets related to physical activity regulation, standardized the data for genomic location and species, and used this data, in an unbiased manner to create a dataset that was used: (1) to physically map and visualize all identified molecules to homologous chromosome locations and (2) as the dataset for which an Upstream Regulator Analysis (URA) was conducted using Qiagen Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. Our search resulted in 469 genetic molecules (e.g. genomic variant, transcript, protein, micro-RNA) that were split into brain (n=366) and muscle (n=345) sub-groups, which was our attempt to separate differences in central vs peripheral pathways. The brain and muscle data sets had several potential upstream regulators, the top-rated being {beta}-estradiol as a regulator for 19.5% and 21% of the brain and muscle datasets respectively. To our knowledge, {beta}-estradiols identification as a potential regulator, is the first evidence to link the well-known effects of sex hormones on physical activity with genetic regulation of physical activity. There were a variety of potential upstream regulators for the molecules collected in this review, but interestingly, three of the top five for both brain and muscle are nuclear receptor binding ligands; estradiol (estrogen receptor), dexamethasone (glucocorticoid receptor), and tretinoin (retinoic acid receptor), indicating a potential role of nuclear receptors in the regulation of physical activity. Selective nuclear receptor modulation may be an area of interest in future mechanistic studies of the genetic regulation of physical activity.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of affordable and more accurate third generation sequencing technologies and the associated bioinformatic tools, it is now possible to sequence, assemble, and annotate more species of conservation concern than ever before. Juglans cinerea, commonly known as butternut or white walnut, is a member of the walnut family, native to the Eastern United States and Southeastern Canada. The species is currently listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List due to decline from an invasive fungus known as Ophiognomonia clavigignenti-juglandacearum (Oc-j) that causes butternut canker. Oc-j creates visible sores on the trunks of the tree which essentially starves and slowly kills the tree. Natural resistance to this pathogen is rare. Conserving butternut is of utmost priority due to its critical ecosystem role and cultural significance. As part of an integrated undergraduate and graduate student training program in biodiversity and conservation genomics, the first reference genome for Juglans cinerea is described here. This chromosome-scale 539 Mb assembly was generated from over 100X coverage of Oxford Nanopore long reads and scaffolded with the Juglans mandshurica genome. Scaffolding with a closely related species oriented and ordered the sequences in a manner more representative of the structure of the genome without altering the sequence. Comparisons with sequenced Juglandaceae revealed high levels of synteny and further supported J. cinereas recent phylogenetic placement. Comparative assessment of gene family evolution revealed a significant number of contracting families, including several associated with biotic stress response.",

Compared to cell delivery using saline, the hydrogel significantly improved the reproducibility of cell transplantation and integration into the host tissue.

    "abstract": "Peripheral nerve injuries persist as a major clinical issue facing the US population and can be caused by stretch, laceration, or crush injuries. Small nerve gaps are simple to treat, and the nerve stumps can be reattached with sutures. In longer nerve gaps, traditional treatment options consist of autografts, hollow nerve guidance conduits, and, more recently, manufactured fibrous scaffolds. These manufactured scaffolds often incorporate stem cells, growth factors, and/or extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins to better mimic the native environment but can have issues with homogenous cell distribution or uniformly oriented neurite outgrowth in scaffolds without fibrous alignment. Here, we utilize a custom device to fabricate collagen I hydrogels with aligned fibers and encapsulated adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) for potential use as a peripheral nerve repair graft. Analysis of these scaffolds in vitro revealed heightened therapeutic secretome from ASCs, ECM deposition, and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurite outgrowth along the axis of fiber alignment. Our platform serves as an in vitro testbed platform to assess neuro-regenerative potential of ASCs in aligned collagen fiber scaffolds and may provide guidance on next-generation nerve repair scaffold design.",

    "abstract": "Aspergillus fumigatus is a notorious pathogenic fungus responsible for various harmful, sometimes lethal, diseases known as aspergilloses. Understanding the gene regulatory networks that specify the expression programs underlying this fungus diverse phenotypes can shed mechanistic insight into its growth, development, and determinants of pathogenicity. We used eighteen RNA-seq datasets (seventeen publicly available and one previously unpublished) of Aspergillus fumigatus to construct a comprehensive gene regulatory network resource. Our resource, named GRAsp (Gene Regulation of Aspergillus fumigatus), was able to recapitulate known regulatory pathways such as response to hypoxia, iron and zinc homeostasis, and secondary metabolite synthesis. Further, GRAsp was experimentally validated in two cases: one in which GRAsp accurately identified an uncharacterized transcription factor negatively regulating the production of the virulence factor gliotoxin and another where GRAsp revealed the bZip protein, AtfA, as required for fungal responses to microbial signals known as lipo-chitooligosaccharides. Our work showcases the strength of using network-based approaches to generate new hypotheses about regulatory relationships in Aspergillus fumigatus. We also unveil an online, user-friendly version of GRAsp available to the Aspergillus research community.",

    "abstract": "The kidney is a complex organ that governs many physiological parameters. It is roughly divided into three parts, the renal pelvis, medulla, and cortex. Covering the cortex is the renal capsule, a serosal tissue that provides protection and forms a barrier for the kidney. Serosal tissues of many organs have been recently shown to play a vital role in homeostasis and disease. Analyses of the cells that reside in these tissues have identified distinct cell types with unique phenotypes. Surprisingly, despite the importance of serosal tissues, little is known about cells of the renal capsule. Here, we characterized this niche and found that it is mainly comprised of fibroblasts and macrophages, but also includes many other diverse cell types. Characterizing renal capsule-associated macrophages, we found that they consist of a distinct subset (i.e., TLF+ macrophages) that is nearly absent in the kidney parenchyma. Injury, disease, and other changes within the kidney, affected the cell composition and phenotype of the renal capsule, indicating its dynamic and vibrant response to changes within the organ parenchyma. Lastly, we studied age-related changes in the renal capsule and found that aging affected the cell composition and pro-inflammatory phenotype of macrophages, increased CD8 T cells and other lymphocyte counts, and promoted a senescence-associated phenotype in fibroblasts. Taken together, our data illustrate the complexity and heterogeneity of the renal capsule and its underlying changes during aging and disease, improving our understanding of the kidney serosa that may be valuable for novel renal therapies.",

    "abstract": "Cytolethal distending toxins (Cdt) are a family of toxins produced by several human pathogens which infect mucocutaneous tissue and induce inflammatory disease. Human macrophages exposed to Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) Cdt respond through canonical and non-canonical inflammasome activation to stimulate cytokine release. The inflammatory response is dependent on PI3K signaling blockade via the toxins phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) phosphatase activity; converting PIP3 to phosphatidylinsoitol-3,4-diphosphate (PI3,4P2) thereby depleting PIP3 pools. Phosphoinositides, also play a critical role in phagosome trafficking, serving as binding domains for effector proteins during phagosome maturation and subsequent fusion with lysosomes. We now demonstrate that AaCdt manipulates the phosphoinositide (PI) pools of phagosome membranes and alters Rab5 association. Exposure of macrophages to AaCdt slowed phagosome maturation and decreased phago-lysosome formation, thereby compromising macrophage phagocytic function. Moreover, macrophages exposed to Cdt showed decreased bactericidal capacity leading to increase in Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans survival. Thus, Cdt may contribute to increased susceptibility to bacterial infection. These studies uncover an underexplored aspect of Cdt function and provide new insight into the virulence potential of Cdt in mediating the pathogenesis of disease caused by Cdt-producing organisms such as Aa.",

    "abstract": "SummaryWith the recent rapid advancements in sequencing technology, the analysis of omics data has become increasingly important for biomedical research. However, many laboratories lack the time or expertise to thoroughly analyze such data. Among omics assays, ATAC-Seq (Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing) and mRNA-Seq (messenger RNA sequencing) are easy and cost-effective methods that are commonly used to define chromatin accessibility and gene expression levels, respectively. Here we introduce Cactus (Chromatin accessibility and transcriptomics unifying software), a pipeline that streamlines the individual or integrated analysis of ATAC-Seq and mRNA-Seq data. The pipeline is written in Nextflow for efficient scaling, caching, and parallelization, and all tools are packaged in Singularity/Docker containers or conda/Mamba virtual environments for simple installation and high reproducibility. Cactus conducts preprocessing on raw sequencing reads, followed by differential analysis between conditions. Results are split into Differential Analysis Subsets (DASs) based on significance threshold, direction of change, annotated genomic regions, and experiment type. Then, Cactus computes enrichments of entries from internal (i.e., DASs) and external (i.e., ontologies, pathways, DNA binding motifs, ChIP-Seq (Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing) binding sites, and chromatin states) databases in DASs and presents results in barplots and customizable heatmaps. The visualization of the results is simplified by the generation of merged PDFs, merged tables, and formatted Excel tables. In conclusion, Cactus can assist researchers in gaining comprehensive insights from chromatin accessibility and gene expression data in a quick, easy, and reproducible manner.\n\nAvailability and implementationCactus can be installed via Nextflow pull jsalignon/cactus.

    "abstract": "Hepatic macrophages maintain liver homeostasis, but little is known about the signals that activate the hepatoprotective programs within macrophages. Here, we show that toll-like receptor 13 (TLR13), a sensor of bacterial 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), senses microbiome RNAs to drive tissue-protective responses in CD5Lhi hepatic macrophages. Splenomegaly and hepatomegaly developed in the absence of the endosomal RNase, RNaseT2, via TLR13-dependent macrophage proliferation. Furthermore, TLR13 in hepatic Ly6Clo macrophages activated the transcription factors LXR and MafB, leading to expression of tissue-clearance molecules, such as CD5L, C1qb, and Axl. Consequently, Rnaset2-/- mice developed resistance to acute liver injury caused by challenges with acetaminophen and lipopolysaccharide + D-galactosamine. TLR13 responses in Rnaset2-/- mice were impaired by antibiotics, suggesting that TLR13 were activated by microbiome rRNAs, which was detected in the sera and hepatic macrophages. Repeated administration of wild-type mice with the TLR13 ligand, rather than other TLR ligands, selectively increased the number of Kupffer cells, which expressed immunoregulatory and tissue-clearance genes as hepatic macrophages in Rnaset2-/- mice did. Our results suggest that microbiome ssRNA serves as an environmental cue for initiating tissue-protective TLR13 responses in hepatic macrophages.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=192 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/540294v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (51K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@69614eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@737c69org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ecd9eforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d7e10d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG In the absence of an endosomal RNase, RNase T2, microbiome RNAs circulating in the vasculature activate TLR13 in hepatic macrophages to drive hepatoprotective responses through expression of immunoregulatory and tissue-clearance molecules.

    "abstract": "Differential regulation of gene expression has produced the astonishing diversity of life on Earth. Understanding the origin and evolution of mechanistic innovations for control of gene expression is therefore integral to evolutionary and developmental biology. Cytoplasmic polyadenylation is the biochemical extension of polyadenosine at the 3-end of cytoplasmic mRNAs. This process regulates the translation of specific maternal transcripts and is mediated by the Cytoplasmic Polyadenylation Element Binding Protein family (CPEBs). Genes that code for CPEBs are amongst a very few that are present in animals but missing in non-animal lineages. Whether cytoplasmic polyadenylation is present in non bilaterian animals (i.e., sponges, ctenophores, placozoans, cnidarians) remains unknown. We have conducted phylogenetic analyses of CPEBs and our results show that CPEB1 and CPEB2 subfamilies originated in the animal stem lineage. Our assessment of expression in the sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis (Cnidaria), and the comb jelly, Mnemiopsis leidyi (Ctenophora), demonstrates that maternal expression of CPEB1 and the catalytic subunit of the cytoplasmic polyadenylation machinery (GLD2) is an ancient feature that is conserved across animals. Furthermore, our measurements of poly(A)-tail elongation reveal that key targets of cytoplasmic polyadenylation are shared between vertebrates, cnidarians, and ctenophores, indicating that this mechanism orchestrates a regulatory network that is conserved throughout animal evolution. We postulate that cytoplasmic polyadenylation through CPEBs was a fundamental innovation that contributed to animal evolution from unicellular life.",

There, CENP-B abundance drives accumulation of microtubule-binding components of the kinetochore, as well as a microtubule-destabilizing kinesin of the inner centromere. The balance of pro and anti-microtubule-binding by the new centromere permits it to segregate during cell division with high fidelity alongside the older ones whose sequence creates a markedly different molecular composition.\n\nTeaserChromatin and kinetochore alterations arise in response to evolutionarily rapid changes to underlying repetitive centromere DNA.",

This is partly due to the ability to tune their elasticity with ease, in addition to various chemical modifications. For affine polymeric networks, two (of three) elastic constants - the Youngs modulus (E), the shear modulus (G), and the Poissons ratio ({nu}) - describe the purely elastic response to external forces. However, the literature addressing the experimental determination of {nu} for PAH (also sometimes referred to as PAA gels in the literature) and PDMS is surprisingly limited when compared to the literature reporting values of E and G. Here, we present a facile method to obtain the Poisons ratio and Youngs modulus for PAH and PDMS based on static tensile tests, and cross-correlate these values with those obtained via a second independent method, shear rheology. We show that: i) the Poissons ratio may vary significantly from the value for incompressible materials ({nu} = 0.5), and ii) find a high degree of agreement between shear rheology and macroscopic static tension tests for PAH but not PDMS.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=121 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/540222v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (24K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@120116forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@58acbcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b48683org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@eb3fda_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Previously, we and others have shown that T cell gene expression phenotypes are regulated by genetic variants associated with autoimmune disease, neurodegenerative disease, and inflammatory processes. However, many complex diseases have polygenic risk with thousands of common variants contributing a small amount to disease heritability. Here, we compute the polygenic risk score (PRS) of several autoimmune, neurological, and psychiatric disorders and present the first correlation of these PRSs with T cell gene expression, using transcriptomic and genomic sequencing data from a cohort of Alzheimers disease (AD) patients and age-matched controls. We validate our AD PRS against clinical metrics in our cohort and then compare PRS-associated genes across traits and four T cell subtypes. Several genes and biological pathways associated with the PRS for these traits relate to functions such as T cell chemotaxis, differentiation, response to and production of cytokines, and regulation of T cell receptor signaling. We also found that the trait-associated gene expression signature for certain traits was polarized towards a particular T cell subset, such as CD4+ for autoimmune disease traits or CD8+ for some psychiatric disease traits. Our findings may help guide efforts in precision medicine to target specific T cell functions in individuals with high polygenic risk for various complex diseases.",

We further tested our morphological analysis on mitochondria that have been altered functionally and morphologically in controlled manners. This work sets the stage to analyze mitochondrial morphological alterations associated with disease progression quantitatively.",

    "abstract": "TITLEAntimitotic Activity of Samanea saman Leaf Extract in the In Vitro Development of Tripneustes gratilla Embryo\n\nINTRODUCTIONCommercially available anticancer drugs are expensive and may have side effects. This led the researchers to look into alternative plant sources. One of these is acacia or S. saman.\n\nOBJECTIVETo determine whether S. saman leaf extract possesses antimitotic activity on T. gratilla embryos using vincristine sulfate as positive control.\n\nMETHODOLOGYS. saman leaves were extracted using hexane, CCl4, CHCl3, and water. T. gratilla embryos were fertilized in vitro. The fractions, vincristine sulfate, and DMSO in filtered sea water were added with the fertilized embryos in petri dishes. Samples were taken at 15 minutes after fertilization and every 30 minutes thereafter until the negative control reached a 32-cell stage. Fifty cells and their mean cell stage was evaluated per treatment. One-way ANOVA and Tukey tests were performed.\n\nRESULTSSignificant differences were seen starting at 75 minutes post fertilization up until the 165th minute using One-way ANOVA. The Tukey test showed that all aqueous and CCl4 as well as hexane (200, 400, 800 ppm) extracts had no significant difference compared to vincristine sulfate; while all CHCl3, hexane (100 ppm), and CCl4 (100 ppm) extracts showed a significant difference compared to vincristine\n\nCONCLUSIONThe aqueous, hexane, and carbon tetrachloride extracts possess potential antimitotic activity on T. gratilla embryos. Thus, it is a potential alternative to vincristine sulfate as an antimitotic agent.",

    "abstract": "Studying gene regulatory networks associated with cancer provides valuable insights for therapeutic purposes, given that cancer is fundamentally a genetic disease. However, as the number of genes in the system increases, the complexity arising from the interconnections between network components grows exponentially. In this study, using Boolean logic to adjust the existing relationships between network components has facilitated simplifying the modeling process, enabling the generation of attractors that represent cell phenotypes based on breast cancer RNA-seq data. A key therapeutic objective is to guide cells, through targeted interventions, to transition from the current cancer attractor to a physiologically distinct attractor unrelated to cancer. To achieve this, we developed a computational method that identifies network nodes whose inhibition can facilitate the desired transition from one tumor attractor to another associated with apoptosis, leveraging transcriptomic data from cell lines. To validate the model, we utilized previously published in vitro experiments where the downregulation of specific proteins resulted in cell growth arrest and death of a breast cancer cell line. The method proposed in this manuscript combines diverse data sources, conducts structural network analysis, and incorporates relevant biological knowledge on apoptosis in cancer cells. This comprehensive approach aims to identify potential targets of significance for personalized medicine.",

    "abstract": "Phthalates are synthetic chemicals widely used as plasticizers and stabilizers in various consumer products. Because of the extensive production and use of phthalates, humans are exposed to these chemicals daily. While most studies focus on a single phthalate, humans are exposed to a mixture of phthalates on a regular basis. The impact of continuous exposure to phthalate mixture on uterus is largely unknown. Thus, we conducted studies in which adult female mice were exposed for 6 months to 0.15 ppm and 1.5 ppm of a mixture of phthalates containing di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, di-iso-nonyl phthalate, benzyl butyl phthalate, di-n-butyl phthalate, diisobutyl phthalate, and diethyl phthalate via chow ad libitum. Our studies revealed that consumption of phthalate mixture at 0.15 ppm and 1.5 ppm for 6 months led to a significant increase in the thickness of the myometrial layer compared to control. Further investigation employing RNA-sequencing revealed an elevated transforming growth factor beta (TGF-{beta}) signaling in the uteri of mice fed with phthalate mixture. TGF-{beta} signaling is associated with the development of fibrosis, a consequence of excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix components, such as collagen fibers in a tissue. Consistent with this observation, we found a higher incidence of collagen deposition in uteri of mice exposed to phthalate mixture compared to unexposed controls. Second Harmonic Generation imaging showed disorganized collagen fibers and an increase in uterine stiffness upon exposure to phthalate mixture. Collectively, our results demonstrate that chronic exposure to phthalate mixture can have adverse effects on uterine homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory viral infections due to RNA viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Using a natural rodent pathogen similar to RSV, Sendai virus (SeV), we found that mice made atopic with house dust mite before viral infection all survived a normally lethal SeV infection.\n\nMoreover, adoptive transfer of CD11c+ cells from atopic mice delayed viral mortality. Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) message was highly expressed in CD11c+ cells from atopic mice and atopic lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid had elevated levels of NRG1 protein. Administration of NRG1 protected non-atopic mice from death and associated with reduced alveolar epithelium permeability. Utilizing an in vitro system of well-differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells and mouse tracheal epithelial cells NRG1 reduced RSV and SeV titers. Expression of genes that play a role in airway epithelium integrity and stability were altered by NRG1; potentially regulating viral induced dysregulation of the epithelia and suggesting NRG1 mediated maintenance of homeostasis. In conclusion, our studies demonstrate atopy induced NRG1 likely plays a novel role in survival from severe respiratory viral infections and may have therapeutic value to prevent mortality from these infections.\n\nSignificanceSevere respiratory viral infections are associated with significant mortality in infants and the elderly; however, allergic disease can protect from these outcomes. This study identified a protein called neuregulin-1 (NRG1), produced by cells of the immune system in allergic mice, that provides a survival advantage against respiratory viral infection. NRG1 pretreatment in non-atopic mice infected with a lethal dose of a rodent RNA virus (Sendai virus), similar to human respiratory syncytial virus, significantly reduced death. Further, NRG1 pretreatment reduced viral replication in human and mouse airway epithelial cell cultures. These studies signify a potential therapeutic role of NRG1 in modulating the severity of respiratory viral infections.",

While diverse mucin degrading bacteria have been identified, the individual host microbial community differences capable of metabolizing this complex polymer are not well described. To determine whether individuals have taxonomically distinct but functionally similar mucin-degrading communities, we used a ten-day in vitro sequential batch culture fermentation from three human donors with mucin as the sole carbon source. For each donor, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was used to characterize microbial community succession, and the short-chain fatty acid profile was determined from the final community. Although two of the final communities had genus-level taxonomic differences signified by the presence of Desulfovibrio and Akkermansia, other members, such as Bacteroides, were shared between all three final communities. Metabolic output differences were most notable for one of the donors communities, with significantly less production of acetate and propionate than the other two communities. These findings reinforce the concept of a taxonomically distinct and, at broad levels, a functionally redundant gut microbiome. Furthermore, the mechanisms and efficiencies of mucin degradation across individuals are important for understanding how this community-level process impacts human health.",

    "abstract": "Chronic hepatitis B (CHB), caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV), remains a major medical problem. HBV has a high propensity for progressing to chronicity and can result in severe liver disease, including fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. CHB patients frequently present with viral coinfection, including HIV and hepatitis delta virus. About 10% of chronic HIV carriers are also persistently infected with HBV which can result in more exacerbated liver disease. Mechanistic studies of HBV-induced immune responses and pathogenesis, which could be significantly influenced by HIV infection, have been hampered by the scarcity of immunocompetent animal models. Here, we demonstrate that humanized mice dually engrafted with components of a human immune system and a human liver supported HBV infection, which was partially controlled by human immune cells, as evidenced by lower levels of serum viremia and HBV replication intermediates in the liver. HBV infection resulted in priming and expansion of human HLA-restricted CD8+ T cells, which acquired an activated phenotype. Notably, our dually humanized mice support persistent coinfections with HBV and HIV which opens opportunities for analyzing immune dysregulation during HBV and HIV coinfection and preclinical testing of novel immunotherapeutics.",

    "abstract": "In this paper the findings of a global literature and social media survey of spider mycoses are presented. Our survey revealed that spider mycoses occur in the geographic belt between latitude 78{degrees} N and 52{degrees} S, and that more than 40 out of the known 132 spider families (>30%) are attacked by fungal pathogens. Jumping spiders (Salticidae), cellar spiders (Pholcidae), and sheet web spiders (Linyphiidae) are the families most frequently reported to be attacked by fungal pathogens (combined >40% of all reported cases). Ninety-two percent of the infections of spiders can be attributed to pathogens in the order Hypocreales / phylum Ascomycota (i.e., almost exclusively families Cordycipitaceae and Ophiocordycipitaceae). Within the Hypocreales, the anamorph genus Gibellula is an historically species-rich and widespread genus of specific spider-pathogenic fungi. For {approx}70 species of spider-pathogenic fungi their hosts could be identified at least to family level. The data presented here reaffirms the findings of previous studies that spider-pathogenic fungi are most common and widespread in tropical and subtropical forested areas, with free-living cursorial hunters (especially Salticidae) being most frequently infected. Free-living cursorial hunters (especially Salticidae) and subterranean cellar spiders (Pholcidae) are the most frequently fungus-infected spiders in North America, whereas web-weavers (especially Linyphiidae and Pholcidae) are the most common spider hosts in Europe. Our survey implies that spider- pathogenic fungi are an important mortality factor of spiders which has hitherto been underestimated.",

    "abstract": "Here we describe the metagenome composition, community functional annotation, and diversity of prokaryotic microbial species derived from calcareous stromatolite formations discovered in the dry stream bed of the open-canopy, ephemeral San Felipe Creek in the Anza Borrego Desert. In this environment, resident microbes must be able to adapt to the harsh conditions of extreme heat, high UV light, desiccation and fluctuating solubilization/precipitation and hydration/evaporation. Metagenomic analysis revealed a community capable of carrying out complete nitrogen fixation and assimilatory nitrate reduction, forming biofilms and quorum sensing, and potentially forming thick-walled akinetes as desiccation-resistant stages. Nitrogen cycling is likely to play a fundamental role in mediating both the structure of the stromatolite microbial community and the mineral precipitation/dissolution. The viruses present in the stromatolites, particularly Nodularia and Mycobacterium phages are also likely to impact community population dynamics and activity. Stromatolite community members possess different morphological and physiological strategies to cope with desiccation stress.\n\nMetagenomic signatures were found for scytonemin, carotenoids, synthesis of potential microsporine-like amino acids; genes involved in microalgal desiccation tolerance, including those encoding aquaporins, chaperones, antioxidants; and enzymes responsible for the synthesis of trehalose, sucrose, and polyamines.\n\nThe stromatolite ecosystem provides a diverse array of microniches where different functional guilds can develop complex metabolite exchange with the substrate supporting their life in extreme conditions. Metagenome analyses revealed several genes that might enable a specialized and unique group of endolithic cyanobacteria including Chroococcidiopsis, Hyella, Myxosarcina, and Pleurocapsa to derive metals and important nutrients from rocks, being potentially destructive for the calcareous formations. Our study revealed environmental adaptations of freshwater microbial communities in desert stream stromatolites which may provide valuable insights into Precambrian paleoenvironments, which are little known.",

Emerging diagnostic and prognostic tools, such as optical nanosensors, experience challenges in successful clinical application in part due to protein corona formation dampening their selectivity and sensitivity. To address this problem, we explored the rational screening of several classes of biomolecules to be employed as agents in non-covalent surface passivation as a strategy to screen interference from non-specific proteins. Findings from this screening were applied to the detection of IL-6 by a fluorescent antibody-conjugated single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT)-based nanosensor. The IL-6 nanosensor exhibited highly sensitive and specific detection after passivation with a polymer, poly-L-lysine, as demonstrated by IL-6 detection in human serum within a clinically relevant range of 25 pg/mL to 25,000 pg/mL, exhibiting a limit of detection over three orders of magnitude lower than prior antibody-conjugated SWCNT sensors.

Cells are the fundamental building blocks of tissues, organized into distinct yet connected components. Although many non-spatial and spatial clustering approaches have been used to partition the entire region into mutually exclusive spatial domains based on the SRT high-dimensional molecular profile, most require an ad-hoc selection of less interpretable dimensional-reduction techniques. To overcome this challenge, we propose a zero-inflated negative binomial mixture model to cluster spots or cells based on their molecular profiles. To increase interpretability, we employ a feature selection mechanism to provide a low-dimensional summary of the SRT molecular profile in terms of discriminating genes that shed light on the clustering result. We further incorporate the SRT geospatial profile via a Markov random field prior. We demonstrate how this joint modeling strategy improves clustering accuracy, compared with alternative state-of-the-art approaches, through simulation studies and two real data applications.",

    "abstract": "Carboxylic acids are central metabolites in bioenergetics, signal transduction and post-translation protein regulation. Unlike its genomic and transcriptomic counterparts, the quest for metabolomic profiling in trace amounts of biomedical samples is prohibitively challenging largely due to the lack of sensitive and robust quantification schemes for carboxylic acids. Based on diazo-carboxyl click chemistry, here we demonstrate DQmB-HA method as a rapid derivatization strategy for the sensitive analysis of hydrophilic, low-molecular-weight carboxylic acids. To the investigated metabolites, DQmB-HA derivatization method renders 5 to 2,000-fold higher response on mass spectrometry along with improved chromatographic separation on commercial UHPLC-MS machines. Using this method, we present the near-single-cell analysis of carboxylic acid metabolites in mouse egg cells before and after fertilization. Malate, fumarate and {beta}-hydroxybutyrate were found to decrease in mouse zygotes. We also showcase the kinetic profiling of TCA-cycle intermediates inside adherent cells cultured in one well of 96-well plates during drug treatment. FCCP and AZD3965 were shown to have overlapped but different effects on the isotope labeling of carboxylic acids. Finally, we apply DQmB-HA method to plasma or serum samples (down to 5 L) from mice and humans collected on pathological and physiological conditions. The measured changes of succinate, {beta}-hydroxybutyrate, and lactate in blood corroborate previous literatures in ischemia-reperfusion injury mouse model, acute fasting-refeeding mouse model, and human individuals diagnosed with mitochondrial dysfunction diseases, respectively. Overall, DQmB-HA method offers a sensitive, rapid and user-friendly quantification scheme for carboxylic acid metabolites, paving the road toward the ultimate goals of single-cell metabolomic analysis and bedside monitoring of biofluid samples.",

Yet, we found that the four signaling sectors strongly affect the kinetics of the ETI transcriptome response based on analysis of individual genes via time-course modeling and of the collective behaviors of the genes via a PCA-based method: the PAD4 sector alone and the JA;SA sector interaction (defined by the averaging model) accelerated the response, while the ET;SA sector interaction delayed it. The response acceleration by the PAD4 sector or the JA;SA sector interaction was consistent with their positive contributions to ETI measured by pathogen growth inhibition. The responsive genes overlapping between ETI and Pattern-Triggered Immunity (PTI) had distinct regulatory trends regarding the four sectors, indicating different regulatory circuits in upstream parts of ETI and PTI signaling. The basal mRNA levels of most ETI-upregulated genes, but not downregulated genes, were predominantly positively regulated by the PAD4;SA sector interaction. This detailed mechanistic decomposition of the roles of four signaling sectors allowed us to propose a potential regulatory network involved in ETI signaling.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWIn 2022, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus clade 2.3.4.4b became enzootic and caused mass mortality in Sandwich terns and other seabird species across northwestern Europe. We present data on characteristics of the spread of the virus between breeding colonies and the number of dead adult Sandwich terns recorded at breeding sites throughout northwestern Europe. Within two months after the first mortalities were reported, in total 20,531 adult Sandwich terns were found dead, which is >17% of the total northwestern European breeding population. Losses are likely higher, as we expect that many victims were not found (mortality rate might be up to 74% of the breeding population). Inside the colonies almost all chicks died. After the peak of the outbreak, in a colony established by late breeders, 25.7% of adults showed immunity against HPAI subtype H5. Removal of carcasses helped in reducing the spread of the disease and consequently total mortality. More research on the sources and modes of transmission, incubation times, effective containment and immunity is urgently needed to combat this major threat for colonial seabirds.",

    "abstract": "Quantifying the potential for abrupt non-linear changes in ecological communities is a key managerial goal, leading to a significant body of research aimed at identifying indicators of approaching regime shifts. Most of this work has built on the theory of bifurcations, with the assumption that critical transitions are a common feature of complex ecological systems. This has led to the development of a suite of often inaccurate early warning signals (EWSs), with more recent techniques seeking to overcome their limitations by analysing multivariate time series or applying machine learning. However, it remains unclear whether regime shifts and/or critical transitions are common occurrences in natural systems, and - if they are present - whether classic and second-generation EWS methods predict rapid community change. Here, using multitrophic data on nine lakes from around the world, we both identify the type of transition a lake is exhibiting, and the reliability of classic and second generation EWSs methods to predict whole ecosystem change. We find few instances of critical transitions in our lake dataset, with different trophic levels often expressing different forms of abrupt change. The ability to predict this change is highly technique dependant, with multivariate EWSs generally classifying correctly, classical rolling window univariate EWSs performing not better than chance, and recently developed machine learning techniques performing poorly. Our results suggest that predictive ecology should start to move away from the concept of critical transitions and develop methods suitable for predicting change in the absence of the strict bounds of bifurcation theory.",

    "abstract": "Climate change and other anthropogenic pressures are altering species distributions. Several studies have indicated that tri-colored bats (Perimyotis subflavus) are extending their distributional range westward in the United States. Montane and subalpine habitats consist of a mosaic of forest types including lodgepole pine woodlands and montane meadows, which provide an opportunity to study how a newly arriving species, typically associated with lowland riparian systems, is adapting to novel environmental conditions. The objective of this study is to document tri-colored bat activity in these novel habitats using acoustic surveys and to quantify what factors are influencing activity patterns in habitats and at elevations not previously documented. We selected sites at 2700m elevation that differed in stand structure, driven primarily by beetle kill outbreaks, and were in various stages of secondary succession. We used acoustic monitoring to model habitat activity patterns using nonparametric multiplicative regression. Results showed that tri-colored bats used meadows and lodgepole pine stands undergoing secondary succession following bark beetle outbreaks. Activity was highest in meadows and early time-since-kill (TSK) forests in the beginning of the survey period, and tri-colored bats had increased activity in late TSK forest habitats at the end of the survey period in early August. Temporally, activity was lowest during the middle of the survey period (mid-July) indicating that tri-colored bats moved away from our study area. However, activity significantly returned by the end of the survey. Our study demonstrates that tri-colored bats are not restricting their activity to lower elevation riparian areas in the Colorado foothills, but instead appear to be using high elevation habitat types in areas dominated by lodgepole pine and subalpine meadows. We hope this study will support conservation efforts for this species following the proposed U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listing.",
