    "abstract": "Entorhinal grid cells implement a spatial code with hexagonal periodicity, signaling the position of the animal within an environment. Grid maps of cells belonging to the same module share spacing and orientation, only differing in relative two-dimensional spatial phase, which could result from being interconnected by a two-dimensional attractor. However, this architecture has the drawbacks of being complex to construct and rigid, allowing no deviations from the hexagonal pattern such as the ones observed under a variety of experimental manipulations. Here we show that a simpler one-dimensional attractor is enough to align grid cells equally well. Using topological data analysis, we show that the resulting population activity is a sample of a torus, while the ensemble of maps preserves features of the network architecture. The flexibility of this low dimensional attractor allows it to negotiate the geometry of the representation manifold with the feedforward inputs, rather than imposing it. More generally, our results represent a proof of principle against the intuition that the architecture and the representation manifold of an attractor are the same topological object, with implications to the study of attractor networks across the brain.",

    "abstract": "Eutrophication impacts grassland diversity such as species richness, functional trait diversity and composition, but whether and how these changes affect ecosystem functional stability under increasing climate extremes is unknown. We quantify the direct and diversity-mediated effects of nutrient addition on functional stability of productivity as measured by resistance during and recovery after dry and wet growing seasons, and temporal invariability across 19 grasslands spanning four continents. We use leaf traits measured in the field to construct slow-fast leaf economic spectrum and calculate functional trait composition and diversity of the slow-fast trait. Nutrient addition increased resistance during dry growing seasons mainly through its direct effects. It also increased resistance during wet growing seasons directly, but these positive effects were weakened by indirect negative effects through reducing slow-fast functional diversity. Nutrient addition had weak effects on recovery after dry growing seasons, but it decreased recovery after wet growing seasons mainly through its direct effects. Nutrient addition increased temporal invariability through resistance, but decreased it through recovery and reducing species richness, leading to overall weak net effects. Thus, processes and influencing pathways independent of plant diversity should be carefully taken into account in understanding ecosystem stability in response to increasing global changes.",

We discovered that a noncanonical activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) by PKA is required for the {beta}AR-stimulation of adipose tissue browning. However, the downstream events triggered by PKA-phosphorylated mTORC1 activation that drive this thermogenic response are not well understood.\n\nMethodsWe used a proteomic approach of Stable Isotope Labeling by/with Amino acids in Cell culture (SILAC) to characterize the global protein phosphorylation profile in brown adipocytes treated with the {beta}AR agonist. We identified salt-inducible kinase 3 (SIK3) as a candidate mTORC1 substrate and further tested the effect of SIK3 deficiency or SIK inhibition on the thermogenic gene expression program in brown adipocytes and in mouse adipose tissue.\n\nResultsSIK3 interacts with RAPTOR, the defining component of the mTORC1 complex, and is phosphorylated at Ser884 in a rapamycin-sensitive manner. Pharmacological SIK inhibition by a pan-SIK inhibitor (HG-9-91-01) in brown adipocytes increases basal Ucp1 gene expression and restores its expression upon blockade of either mTORC1 or PKA. Short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown of Sik3 augments, while overexpression of SIK3 suppresses, Ucp1 gene expression in brown adipocytes. The regulatory PKA phosphorylation domain of SIK3 is essential for its inhibition. CRISPR-mediated Sik3 deletion in brown adipocytes increases type IIa histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity and enhances the expression of genes involved in thermogenesis such as Ucp1, Pgc1, and mitochondrial OXPHOS complex protein. We further show that HDAC4 interacts with PGC1 after {beta}AR stimulation and reduces lysine acetylation in PGC1. Finally, a SIK inhibitor well-tolerated in vivo (YKL-05-099) can stimulate the expression of thermogenesis-related genes and browning of mouse subcutaneous adipose tissue.\n\nConclusionsTaken together, our data reveal that SIK3, with the possible contribution of other SIKs, functions as a phosphorylation switch for {beta}-adrenergic activation to drive the adipose tissue thermogenic program and indicates that more work to understand the role of the SIKs is warranted. Our findings also suggest that maneuvers targeting SIKs could be beneficial for obesity and related cardiometabolic disease.",

    "abstract": "The ability of the brain to extract patterns from the environment and predict future events, known as statistical learning, has been proposed to interact in a competitive manner with prefrontal lobe related networks and their characteristic cognitive or executive functions. However, it remains unclear whether these cognitive functions also show competitive relationship with implicit statistical learning across individuals and at the level of latent executive function components. In order to address this currently unknown aspect, we investigated, in two independent experiments (NStudy1 = 186, NStudy2 = 157), the relationship between implicit statistical learning, measured by the Alternating Serial Reaction Time task, and executive functions, measured by multiple neuropsychological tests. In both studies, a modest, but consistent negative correlation between implicit statistical learning and most executive function measures was observed. Factor analysis further revealed that a factor representing the verbal fluency and complex working memory seemed to drive these negative correlations. Thus, an antagonism between implicit statistical learning and executive functions might specifically be mediated by updating component of executive functions or/and long-term memory access.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infects cells in multiple lung myeloid cell subsets and causes chronic infection despite innate and adaptive immune responses. However, the mechanisms allowing Mtb to evade elimination are not fully understood. Here, using new methods, we determined that after T cell responses have developed, CD11clo monocyte-derived lung cells termed MNC1 (mononuclear cell subset 1), harbor more live Mtb compared to alveolar macrophages (AM), neutrophils, and less permissive CD11chi MNC2. Bulk RNA sequencing of sorted cells revealed that the lysosome biogenesis pathway is underexpressed in MNC1. Functional assays confirmed that Mtb-permissive MNC1 have less lysosome content, acidification, and proteolytic activity than AM, and less nuclear TFEB, a master regulator of lysosome biogenesis. Mtb infection does not drive lysosome deficiency in MNC1 in vivo. Instead, Mtb recruits MNC1 and MNC2 to the lungs for its spread from AM to these cell subsets as a virulence mechanism that requires the Mtb ESX-1 secretion system. The c-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor nilotinib activates TFEB and enhances lysosome function of primary macrophages in vitro and MNC1 and MNC2 in vivo, improving control of Mtb infection. Our results indicate that Mtb exploits lysosome-poor monocyte-derived cells for in vivo persistence, suggesting a potential target for host-directed tuberculosis therapy.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryVirulent Mtb recruits and exploits intrinsically lysosome-deficient lung mononuclear cell subsets to resist elimination during chronic infection.",

This observation supports the concept that monogenic neurodevelopmental disorders are systemic diseases that profoundly impact neurodevelopment. We tested the systemic disease model focusing on Rett syndrome, which is caused by mutations in MECP2. Transcriptomes and proteomes of organs and brain regions from Mecp2-null mice as well as diverse MECP2-null male and female human cells were assessed. Widespread changes in the steady-state transcriptome and proteome were identified in brain regions and organs of presymptomatic Mecp2-null male mice as well as mutant human cell lines. The extent of these transcriptome and proteome modifications was similar in cortex, liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle and more pronounced than in the hippocampus and striatum. In particular, Mecp2- and MECP2-sensitive proteomes were enriched in synaptic and metabolic annotated gene products, the latter encompassing lipid metabolism and mitochondrial pathways. MECP2 mutations altered pyruvate-dependent mitochondrial respiration while maintaining the capacity to use glutamine as a mitochondrial carbon source. We conclude that mutations in Mecp2/MECP2 perturb lipid and mitochondrial metabolism systemically limiting cellular flexibility to utilize mitochondrial fuels.",

In this study, we experimentally determined e-liquid cardiotoxicity in both healthy cells and cells with long QT syndrome by treating healthy and diseased human cardiomyocytes with e-liquids with varying nicotine concentrations. These cardiomyocytes were generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells. The cardiomyocytes were divided into 5 groups, a control group and 4 test groups, each treated with e-liquid containing varying amounts of nicotine between 0% and 70%. The cells biological indicators such as heart rate, pulse pressure, essential protein concentration, and metabolic activity, were measured and characterized using three different functional assays: contractility, Western blot, and viability, and tracked over 4 days. The results demonstrated that acute exposure to e-liquid led to tachycardia, hypertension, decreased protein levels, and cell death. The rate of cardiotoxicity increases with higher nicotine concentrations. The basal fluid also showed non-negligible toxicity. Under identical conditions, the functionality of the diseased heart cells declined at a faster rate compared to healthy cells. Overall, this work establishes the harmful physiological effects of e-cigarettes on the human heart quantitatively.",

    "abstract": "RationaleHuman pluripotent stem cell-derived CMs (iPSC-CMs) are a valuable tool for disease modeling, cell therapy and to reconstruct the CM maturation process and identify, characterize factors that regulate maturation. The transition from immature fetal to adult CM entails coordinated regulation of the mature gene programming, which is characterized by the induction of myofilament and OXPHOS gene expression among others. Recent studies in Drosophila, C. elegans, and C2C12 myoblast cell lines have implicated the histone H3K4me3 demethylase KDM5 and its homologs, as a potential regulator of developmental gene program and mitochondrial function. We speculated that KDM5 may potentiate the maturation of iPSC-CMs by targeting a conserved epigenetic program that encompass mitochondrial OXPHOS and other CM specific maturation genes.\n\nObjectivesThe purpose of this study is to determine the role of KDM5 in iPSC-CM maturation.\n\nMethods and ResultsImmunoblot analysis revealed that KDM5A, B, and C expression was progressively downregulated in postnatal cardiomyocytes and absent in adult hearts and CMs. Additionally, KDM5 proteins were found to be persistently expressed in iPSC-CMs up to 60 days after the onset of myogenic differentiation, consistent with the immaturity of these cells. Inhibition of KDM5 by KDM5-C70 -a pan-KDM5 inhibitor-resulted in differential regulation of 2,372 genes including upregulation of Fatty acid oxidation (FAO), OXPHOS, and myogenic gene programs in iPSC-CMs. Likewise, genome-wide profiling of H3K4me3 binding sites by the CUT&RUN assay revealed enriched H3K4me3 peaks at the promoter regions of FAO, OXPHOS, and sarcomere genes. Consistent with the chromatin and gene expression data, KDM5 inhibition led to increased expression of multiple sarcomere proteins, enhanced myofibrillar organization and improved calcium handling. Furthermore, inhibition of KDM5 increased H3K4me3 deposits at the promoter region of the ESRRA gene, which is known to regulate OXPHOS and cardiomyocyte maturation, and resulted in its increased RNA and protein levels. Finally, KDM5 inhibition increased baseline, peak, and spare oxygen consumption rates in iPSC-CMs.\n\nConclusionsKDM5 regulates the maturation of iPSC-CMs by epigenetically regulating the expression of ESRRA, OXPHOS, FAO, and sarcomere genes and enhancing myofibril organization and mitochondrial function.",

    "abstract": "Every interaction of a living organism with its environment involves the placement of a bet. Armed with partial knowledge about a stochastic world, the organism must decide its next step or near-term strategy, an act that implicitly or explicitly involves the assumption of a model of the world. Better information about environmental statistics can improve the bet quality, but in practice resources for information gathering are always limited. We argue that theories of optimal inference dictate that \"complex\" models are harder to infer with bounded information and lead to larger prediction errors. Thus, we propose a principle of playing it safe where, given finite information gathering capacity, biological systems should be biased towards simpler models of the world, and thereby to less risky betting strategies. In the framework of Bayesian inference, we show that there is an optimally safe adaptation strategy determined by the Bayesian prior. We then demonstrate that, in the context of stochastic phenotypic switching by bacteria, implementation of our principle of \"playing it safe\" increases fitness (population growth rate) of the bacterial collective. We suggest that the principle applies broadly to problems of adaptation, learning and evolution, and illuminates the types of environments in which organisms are able to thrive.",

These techniques have generated large datasets of cellular morphologies, which are typically used to investigate the effects of small molecule perturbagens. In this work, we extend the impact of such dataset to improving quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models by introducing Molecule-Morphology Contrastive Pretraining (MoCoP), a framework for learning multi-modal representation of molecular graphs and cellular morphologies. We scale MoCoP to approximately 100K molecules and 600K morphological profiles using data from the JUMP-CP Consortium and show that MoCoP consistently improves performances of graph neural networks (GNNs) on molecular property prediction tasks in ChEMBL20 across all dataset sizes. The pretrained GNNs are also evaluated on internal GSK pharmacokinetic data and show an average improvement of 2.6% and 6.3% in AUPRC for full and low data regimes, respectively. Our findings suggest that integrating cellular morphologies with molecular graphs using MoCoP can significantly improve the performance of QSAR models, ultimately expanding the deep learning toolbox available for QSAR applications.",

The largest collection to date of molecular dynamics traces of protein-ligand complexes in explicit water are included, accumulating to 170 s. We give ML baseline models and simple Python data loaders, and aim to foster a thriving community around MISATO (https://github.com/t7morgen/misato-dataset). An easy entry point for ML experts is provided without the need of deep domain expertise to enable the next generation of drug discovery AI models.",

    "abstract": "Nociceptive afferent axons innervate the stomach and send signals to the brain and spinal cord. Peripheral nociceptive afferents can be detected with a variety of markers [e.g., substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)]. We recently examined the topographical organization and morphology of SP-immunoreactive (SP-IR) axons in the whole mouse stomach muscular layer. However, the distribution and morphological structure of CGRP-IR axons remain unclear. We used immunohistochemistry labeling and applied a combination of imaging techniques, including confocal and Zeiss Imager M2 microscopy, Neurolucida 360 tracing, and integration of axon tracing data into a 3D stomach scaffold to characterize CGRP-IR axons and terminals in the whole mouse stomach muscular layers. We found that: 1) CGRP-IR axons formed extensive terminal networks in both ventral and dorsal stomachs. 2) CGRP-IR axons densely innervated the blood vessels. 3) CGRP-IR axons ran in parallel with the longitudinal and circular muscles. Some axons ran at angles through the muscular layers. 4) They also formed varicose terminal contacts with individual myenteric ganglion neurons. 5) CGRP-IR occurred in DiI-labeled gastric-projecting neurons in the dorsal root and vagal nodose ganglia, indicating CGRP-IR axons were visceral afferent axons. 6) CGRP-IR axons did not colocalize with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) axons in the stomach, indicating CGRP-IR axons were not visceral efferent axons. 7) CGRP-IR axons were traced and integrated into a 3D stomach scaffold. For the first time, we provided a topographical distribution map of CGRP-IR axon innervation of the whole stomach muscular layers at the cellular/axonal/varicosity scale.",

    "abstract": "The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) is a membrane transporter that creates and maintains intracellular Ca2+ stores. In the heart, SERCA is regulated by an inhibitory interaction with the monomeric form of the transmembrane micropeptide phospholamban (PLB). PLB also forms avid homo-pentamers, and dynamic exchange of PLB between pentamers and the regulatory complex with SERCA is an important determinant of cardiac responsiveness to exercise. Here, we investigated two naturally occurring pathogenic mutations of PLB, a cysteine substitution of arginine 9 (R9C) and an in-frame deletion of arginine 14 (R14del). Both mutations are associated with dilated cardiomyopathy. We previously showed that the R9C mutation causes disulfide crosslinking and hyperstabilization of pentamers. While the pathogenic mechanism of R14del is unclear, we hypothesized that this mutation may also alter PLB homo-oligomerization and disrupt the PLB-SERCA regulatory interaction. SDS-PAGE revealed a significantly increased pentamer:monomer ratio for R14del-PLB when compared to WT-PLB. In addition, we quantified homo-oligomerization and SERCA-binding in live cells using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy. R14del-PLB showed an increased affinity for homo-oligomerization and decreased binding affinity for SERCA compared to WT, suggesting that, like R9C, the R14del mutation stabilizes PLB in its pentameric form, decreasing its ability to regulate SERCA. Moreover, the R14del mutation reduces the rate of PLB unbinding from the pentamer after a transient Ca2+ elevation, limiting the rate of re-binding to SERCA. A computational model predicted that hyperstabilization of PLB pentamers by R14del impairs the ability of cardiac Ca2+ handling to respond to changing heart rates between rest and exercise. We postulate that impaired responsiveness to physiological stress contributes to arrhythmogenesis in human carriers of the R14del mutation.",

    "abstract": "RationaleHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common cardiac genetic disorder caused by sarcomeric gene variants and associated with left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction. The role of the microtubule network has recently gained interest with the findings that -tubulin detyrosination (dTyr-tub) is markedly elevated in heart failure. Reduction of dTyr-tub by inhibition of the detyrosinase (VASH/SVBP complex) or activation of the tyrosinase (tubulin tyrosine ligase, TTL) markedly improved contractility and reduced stiffness in human failing cardiomyocytes, and thus poses a new perspective for HCM treatment.\n\nObjectiveIn this study, we tested the impact of targeting dTyr-tub in a mouse model of HCM, the Mybpc3-targeted knock-in (KI) mice, and in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes and engineered heart tissues (EHTs) deficient in SVBP or TTL.\n\nMethods and ResultsTTL gene transfer was tested in wild-type (WT) mice and rats and in adult KI mice. We show that i) TTL dose-dependently reduced dTyr-tub and improved contractility without affecting cytosolic calcium transients in WT cardiomyocytes; ii) TTL partially improved LV function and diastolic filling, reduced stiffness and normalized cardiac output and stroke volume in KI mice; iii) TTL induced a marked transcription and translation of several tubulins in KI mice; iv) TTL modulated mRNA or protein levels of components of mitochondria, Z-disc, ribosome, intercalated disc, lysosome and cytoskeleton in KI mice; v) SVBP-KO and TTL-KO EHTs exhibited low and high dTyr-tub levels, higher and lower force of contraction and enhanced and prolonged relaxation than in WT EHTs, respectively. RNA-seq and mass spectrometry analysis revealed distinct enrichment of cardiomyocyte components and pathways in SVBP-KO vs. TTL-KO EHTs.\n\nConclusionThis study provides evidence that reducing dTyr-tub improves function in HCM mouse hearts and human EHTs and holds promise for targeting the non-sarcomeric cytoskeleton in heart disease.",

    "abstract": "RationaleCardiac conduction is understood to occur through gap junctions. Recent evidence supports ephaptic coupling as another mechanism of electrical communication in heart. Conduction via gap junctions predicts a direct relationship between conduction velocity (CV) and bulk extracellular volume. Ephaptic theory is premised on the existence of a biphasic relationship between CV and the volume of specialized extracellular clefts within intercalated discs.\n\nObjectiveDetermine the relationship between ventricular CV and structural changes to micro and nano-scale extracellular spaces.\n\nMethodsConduction and connexin43 (Cx43) gap junction protein expression were quantified from optically mapped guinea pig whole-heart preparations perfused with albumin, mannitol, dextran 70kDa, or dextran 2MDa. Peak sodium current was quantified from isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes. Extracellular resistance (Re) was quantified by impedance spectroscopy. Intercellular communication was assessed in a heterologous expression system with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Perinexal width was quantified from transmission electron micrographs.\n\nResultsCV was significantly reduced by mannitol, and increased by albumin, dextran 70kDa and 2MDa. The combination of albumin and dextran 70kDa decreased CV relative to albumin alone. Re was reduced by mannitol, not significantly changed by albumin, and increased by both dextran 70kDa and dextran 2MDa. Cx43 gap junction expression and conductance, and peak sodium current were not significantly altered by the osmotic agents. The perinexal width in response to osmotic agents, in order of narrowest to widest, was: albumin with dextran 70kDa, albumin or dextran 2MDa alone, dextran 70kDa or no osmotic agent, and mannitol. When compared in the same order, CV was biphasically related to perinexal width.\n\nConclusionsCardiac conduction does not correlate with bulk tissue impedance, but is biphasically related to perinexal separation, providing evidence that the relationship between CV and extracellular volume in ventricular myocardium is determined by ephaptic mechanisms under conditions of normal gap junctional coupling.",

We found that Nod factors are produced by symbionts to activate Nod factor signaling in the host, and this modulates the assembly of a symbiotic root microbiota. Lotus plants grown in symbiosis-permissive or suppressive soils delineated three nitrogen-dependent nutritional states: starved, symbiotic, or inorganic. We found that root and rhizosphere microbiomes associated with these states differ in composition and connectivity, demonstrating that symbiosis and inorganic nitrogen impact the legume root microbiota differently.

    "abstract": "Sleep is broadly conserved across the animal kingdom, but can vary widely between species. It is currently unclear which types of selective pressures and sleep regulatory mechanisms influence differences in sleep between species. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has become a successful model system for examining sleep regulation and function, but little is known about the sleep patterns and need for sleep in many related fly species. Here, we find that Drosophila mojavensis, a fly species that has adapted to extreme desert environments, exhibits strong increases in sleep compared to D. melanogaster. Long-sleeping D. mojavensis show intact sleep homeostasis, indicating that these flies carry an elevated need for sleep. In addition, D. mojavensis exhibit altered abundance or distribution of several sleep/wake related neuromodulators and neuropeptides that are consistent with their reduced locomotor activity, and increased sleep. Finally, we find that in a nutrient-deprived environment, the sleep responses of individual D. mojavensis are correlated with their survival time. Our results demonstrate that D. mojavensis is a novel model for studying organisms with high sleep need, and for exploring sleep strategies that provide resilience in extreme environments.",

    "abstract": "Neurogenic bladder dysfunction causes urological complications and reduces the quality of life in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI). Glutamatergic signaling via AMPA receptors is fundamentally important to the neural circuits controlling bladder voiding. Ampakines are positive allosteric modulators of AMPA receptors that can enhance the function of glutamatergic neural circuits after SCI. We hypothesized that ampakines can acutely stimulate bladder voiding that has been impaired due to thoracic contusion SCI. Adult female Sprague Dawley rats received a unilateral contusion of the T9 spinal cord (n=10). Bladder function (cystometry) and coordination with the external urethral sphincter (EUS) were assessed five days post-SCI under urethane anesthesia. Data were compared to responses in spinal intact rats (n=8). The \"low impact\" ampakine CX1739 (5, 10, or 15 mg/kg) or vehicle (HPCD) was administered intravenously. The HPCD vehicle had no discernable impact on voiding. In contrast, following CX1739, the pressure threshold for inducing bladder contraction, voided volume, and the interval between bladder contractions were significantly reduced. These responses occurred in a dose-dependent manner. We conclude that modulating AMPA receptor function using ampakines can rapidly improve bladder voiding capability at sub-acute time points following contusion SCI. These results may provide a new and translatable method for therapeutic targeting of bladder dysfunction acutely after SCI.\n\nSignificanceThere are limited options for patients with recovery of bladder function following spinal cord injury, with most therapies focusing on treating the symptoms, primarily through catheterization. Here we demonstrate that intravenous delivery of a drug which acts as an allosteric modulator of the AMPA type receptor (an \"ampakine\") can rapidly improve bladder function following spinal cord injury. The data suggest that ampakines may be a new therapy for early hyporeflexive bladder states following spinal cord injury.",

    "abstract": "Effective self-localization requires that the brain can resolve ambiguities in incoming sensory information arising from self-similarities (symmetries) in the environment structure. We investigated how place cells use environmental cues to resolve the ambiguity of a rotationally symmetric environment, by recording from hippocampal CA1 in rats exploring a  2-box. This apparatus comprises two adjacent rectangular compartments, identical but with directionally opposed layouts (cue card at one end and central connecting doorway) and distinguished by their odor contexts (lemon vs. vanilla). Despite the structural and visual rotational symmetry of the boxes, no place cells rotated their place fields. The majority remapped their fields between boxes but some repeated them, maintaining a translational symmetry and thus adopting a relationship to the layout that was conditional on the odor. In general, the place field ensemble maintained a stable relationship to environment orientation as defined by the odors, but sometimes the whole ensemble rotated its firing en bloc, decoupling from the odor context cues. While the individual elements of these observations - odor remapping, place field repetition, ensemble rotation and decoupling from context - have been reported in isolation, the combination in the one experiment is incompletely explained within current models. We redress this by proposing a model in which odor cues enter into a three-way association with layout cues and head direction, creating a configural context signal that facilitates two separate processes: place field orientation, and place field positioning. This configuration can subsequently still function in the absence of one of its components, explaining the ensemble decoupling from odor. We speculate that these interactions occur in retrosplenial cortex, because it has previously been implicated in context processing, and all the relevant signals converge here.",

We developed a physiologically realistic method to replicate proprioceptive input to lch5 by pulling the apodeme (tendon) to which the tips of the neurons attach.

    "abstract": "Most living organisms have evolved to synchronize their biological activities with the earths rotation, a daily regulation of biology and behaviour controlled by an evolutionary conserved molecular machinery known as the circadian clock. For most animals, circadian mechanisms are meant to maximize their exposure to positive activities (e.g.: social interactions, mating, feeding - generally during the day) and minimize their exposure to peril (e.g.: predation, weather, darkness - generally during the night1). On top of circadian regulation, some behaviours also feature a second layer of homeostatic control acting as a fail-safe to ensure important activities are not ignored. Sleep is one of these behaviours: largely controlled by the circadian clock for its baseline appearance, it is at the same time modulated by a - poorly understood - homeostatic regulator ensuring animals obey their species-specific amount of daily sleep2. An evolutionary conserved homeostatic control is often considered the main evidence for a core biological function of sleep beyond the trivial one (that is: keeping us out of trouble by limiting our energy expenditure and exposure to danger3,4) and it is hypothesized that sleep evolved around this mysterious basic biological function. Here we characterize sleep regulation in a group of seven species of the Drosophila genus at key evolutionary distances and representing a variety of ecological niche adaptations. We show that the spontaneous circadian-driven aspects of sleep are conserved among all species but the homeostatic regulation, unexpectedly, is not. We uncover differences in the behavioural, cell-biological and neuro-pharmacological aspects of sleep and suggest that, in Drosophilids, sleep primarily evolved to satisfy a circadian role, keeping animals immobile during dangerous hours of the day. The homeostatic functions of sleep evolved independently, in a species-specific fashion, and are not conserved.",

Here we demonstrate a droplet-based microfluidic technology, Drop-BS, to construct single-cell bisulfite sequencing libraries for DNA methylome profiling. Drop-BS takes advantage of the ultrahigh throughput offered by droplet microfluidics to prepare bisulfite sequencing libraries of up to 10,000 single cells within 2 d. We applied the technology to profile mixed cell lines, mouse and human brain tissues to reveal cell type heterogeneity. Drop-BS will pave the way for single-cell methylomic studies requiring examination of a large cell population.",

    "abstract": "Lithographic nanopatterning techniques like photolithography, electron-beam lithography, and nanoimprint lithography (NIL) have revolutionized modern-day electronics and optics. Yet, their application for creating nano-bio interfaces is limited by the cytotoxic and two-dimensional nature of conventional fabrication methods. Here, we present a biocompatible and cost-effective transfer process that leverages (a) NIL to define sub-300 nm gold (Au) nanopattern arrays, (b) amine functionalization of Au to transfer the NIL-arrays from a rigid substrate to a soft transfer layer, (c) alginate hydrogel as a flexible, degradable transfer layer, and (d) gelatin conjugation of the Au NIL-arrays to achieve conformal contact with live cells. We demonstrate biotransfer printing of the Au NIL-arrays on rat brains and live cells with high pattern fidelity and cell viability and observed differences in cell migration on the Au NIL-dot and NIL-wire printed hydrogels. We anticipate that this nanolithography-compatible biotransfer printing method could advance bionics, biosensing, and biohybrid tissue interfaces.\n\nTOC Figure\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=97 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/542285v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (54K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16f6e1corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a60bacorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1485d06org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d365c9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "CAR T cell therapy is a promising approach to improve outcomes and decrease toxicities for patients with cancer. While extraordinary success has been achieved using CAR T cells to treat patients with CD19-positive malignancies, multiple obstacles have so far limited the benefit of CAR T cell therapy for patients with solid tumors. Novel manufacturing and engineering approaches show great promise to enhance CAR T cell function against solid tumors. However, similar to single agent chemotherapy approaches, CAR T cell monotherapy may be unable to achieve high cure rates for patients with difficult to treat solid tumors. Thus, combinatorial drug plus CAR T cell approaches may ultimately be required to achieve widespread clinical success. In this regard, we developed a novel high-content and high-throughput screen to evaluate 1114 FDA approved drugs to increase expression of the solid tumor antigen B7-H3 in metastatic osteosarcoma cells. In this proof-of-principle screen, we demonstrate that ingenol-3-angelate increased B7-H3 (CD276) mRNA, total protein, and cell surface expression. Mechanistically, ingenol-3-angelate increased B7-H3 expression via protein kinase C alpha activation. Functionally, ingenol-3-angelate induced B7-H3 expression enhanced B7-H3-CAR T cell function, highlighting utility of the approach, and paving the way for expanding this high-throughput and high-content technique to study other tumor and CAR T cell combinations.",

    "abstract": "Environmentally sensitive sex determination may help organisms adapt to environmental change but also makes them vulnerable to anthropogenic stressors, with diverse consequences for population dynamics and evolution. The mechanisms translating environmental stimuli to sex are controversial: although several fish experiments supported the mediator role of glucocorticoid hormones, results on some reptiles challenged it. We tested this hypothesis in amphibians by investigating the effect of corticosterone on sex determination in agile frogs (Rana dalmatina). This species is liable to environmental sex reversal whereby genetic females develop into phenotypic males. After exposing tadpoles during sex determination to waterborne corticosterone, the proportion of genetic females with testes or ovotestes increased from 11% to up to 32% at 3 out of 4 concentrations. These differences were not statistically significant except for the group treated with 10 nM corticosterone, and there was no monotonous dose-effect relationship. These findings suggest that corticosterone is unlikely to mediate sex reversal in frogs. Unexpectedly, animals originating from urban habitats had higher sex-reversal and corticosterone-release rates, reduced body mass and development speed, and lower survival compared to individuals collected from woodland habitats. Thus, anthropogenic environments may affect both sex and fitness, and the underlying mechanisms may vary across ectothermic vertebrates.",

In plants, known NHEJ proteins are the core factors only, and the molecular mechanism of plant NHEJ remains unclear. Here, we report a previously unidentified plant ortholog of PAXX, the crystal structure of which showed a similar fold to human PAXX. However, plant PAXX has similar molecular functions to human XLF, by directly interacting with Ku70/80 and XRCC4. This suggests that plant PAXX combines the roles of mammalian PAXX and XLF and that these functions merged into a single protein during evolution. This is consistent with a redundant function of PAXX and XLF in mammals.",

Focusing on microbial growth, we use nunchaku to identify the range of optical density where the density is linearly proportional to the number of cells and to automatically find the regions of exponential growth for both Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For budding yeast, we consequently are able to infer the Monod constant for growth on fructose.

    "abstract": "Large-scale cell flow characterizes gastrulation in animal development. In amniote gastrulation, a bilateral vortex-like counter-rotating cell flow, called  polonaise movements, appears along the midline. Here, through experimental manipulations, we addressed relationships between the polonaise movements and morphogenesis of the primitive streak, the earliest midline structure in amniotes. Suppression of the Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway maintains the polonaise movements along a deformed primitive streak. Mitotic arrest leads to diminished extension and development of the primitive streak and maintains the early phase of the polonaise movements. Ectopically induced Vg1, an axis-inducing morphogen, generates the polonaise movements, aligned to the induced midline, but disturbs the stereotypical cell flow pattern at the authentic midline. Despite the altered cell flow, induction and extension of the primitive streak are preserved along both authentic and induced midlines. Finally, we show that ectopic axis-inducing morphogen, Vg1, is capable of initiating the polonaise movements without concomitant PS extension under mitotic arrest conditions. These results are consistent with a model wherein primitive streak morphogenesis is required for the maintenance of the polonaise movements, but the polonaise movements are not necessarily responsible for primitive streak morphogenesis. Our data describe a previously undefined relationship between the large-scale cell flow and midline morphogenesis in gastrulation.",

    "abstract": "Insects are ectotherms, and as such, rely on a diverse repertoire of thermoreceptors to monitor environmental temperature and control behavioral thermoregulation. Here, we use structural, phylogenetic, genetic, and functional analyses to show that TRPA5 genes, widespread across numerous insect orders, encode a novel class of noxious heat receptors. We show that in the triatomine bug Rhodnius prolixus, the primary vector of Chagas disease, Rp-TRPA52 differs biophysically and structurally from noxious thermoTRPAs previously described in insects. This includes key changes in the ankyrin repeat domain and the selectivity filter of the channel. In vitro, we find evidence that the homo-tetrameric channel is not activated by voltage, but displays high thermosensitivity with an enthalpy change ({Delta}H) of 72 kcal/mol associated with the channel activation, with a Q10 = 25 and T{degrees}half = 58.6{degrees}C. Structural analyses reveal parallels in the overall ion channel architecture between fruit fly TRPA1 and Rp-TRPA52; however, functional properties and expression patterns indicate that the role of Rp-TRPA52 is more similar to that of Pyrexia noxious heat receptors found in fruit flies. Pyrexia genes have been lost in true bugs, and our findings suggest that the rapidly evolving insect TRPA gene family has given rise to an independent evolutionary origin of a molecular transducer that is responsive to noxious thermal stimuli.",

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) using modern training techniques have shown promise in accurately predicting movements from neural signals but have yet to be rigorously evaluated against other decoding algorithms in a closed-loop setting. Here we compared RNNs to other neural network architectures in real-time, continuous decoding of finger movements using intracortical signals from nonhuman primates. Across one and two finger online tasks, LSTMs (a type of RNN) outperformed convolutional and transformer-based neural networks, averaging 18% higher throughput than the convolution network. On simplified tasks with a reduced movement set, RNN decoders were allowed to memorize movement patterns and matched able-bodied control. Performance gradually dropped as the number of distinct movements increased but did not go below fully continuous decoder performance. Finally, in a two-finger task where one degree-of-freedom had poor input signals, we recovered functional control using RNNs trained to act both like a movement classifier and continuous decoder. Our results suggest that RNNs can enable functional real-time BMI control by learning and generating accurate movement patterns.",

    "abstract": "The optic nerve head (ONH) region at the posterior pole of the eye is supported by a fibrous structure of collagen fiber bundles. Discerning how the fibrous structure determines the region biomechanics is crucial to understand normal physiology, and the roles of biomechanics on vision loss. The fiber bundles within the ONH structure exhibit complex three-dimensional (3D) organization and continuity across the various tissue components. Computational models of the ONH, however, usually represent collagen fibers in a homogenized fashion without accounting for their continuity across tissues, fibers interacting with each other and other synergistic effects in a fibrous structure. We present a novel fibrous finite element (FFE) model of the ONH that incorporates discrete collagen fiber bundles and their histology-based 3D organization to study ONH biomechanics as a fibrous structure. The FFE model was constructed using polarized light microscopy data of porcine ONH cryosections, representing individual fiber bundles in the sclera, dura and pia maters with beam elements and canal tissues as continuum structures. The FFE model mimics the histological in-plane orientation and width distributions of collagen bundles as well as their continuity across different tissues. Modeling the fiber bundles as linear materials, the FFE model predicts the nonlinear ONH response observed in an inflation experiment from the literature. The model also captures important microstructural mechanisms including fiber interactions and long-range strain transmission among bundles that have not been considered before. The FFE model presented here advances our understanding of the role of fibrous collagen structure in the ONH biomechanics.\n\nStatement of SignificanceThe microstructure and mechanics of the optic nerve head (ONH) are central to ocular physiology. Histologically, the ONH region exhibits a complex continuous fibrous structure of collagen bundles. Understanding the role of the fibrous collagen structure on ONH biomechanics requires high-fidelity computational models previously unavailable. We present a novel computational model of the ONH that incorporates histology-based fibrous collagen structure derived from polarized light microscopy images. The model predictions agree with experiments in the literature, and provide insight into important microstructural mechanisms of fibrous tissue biomechanics, such as long-range strain transmission along fiber bundles. Our model can be used to study the microstructural basis of biomechanical damage and the effects of collagen remodeling in glaucoma.",

    "abstract": "Changes in gene expression patterns with age are observed in all organisms and tissues studied thus far. However, very little overlap is observed when comparing absolute gene expression changes across tissues, which could be interpreted as a lack of commonly affected pathways in aging. Considering that a given gene function can be altered by changes in its absolute expression level but also by changes in co-expression networks, we analyzed differences with age in absolute gene expression levels as well as using several network analysis techniques, which quantify co-expression levels in weighted networks. This revealed that some tissues display great changes in gene co-expression, but not in absolute gene expression, and vice-versa. By combining these altered genes with age in different metrics and network clustering, we show that most of the processes modulated by age are similar across tissues, with the most prominent being modules enriched with terms related to mitochondria, immune system, autophagy, protein catabolism and folding, RNA splicing and ribosomal biogenesis, with all the terms in this last group falling under the same connectivity modules. Further analyses of module preservation with age reinforced the conservation of affected processes across tissues under the light of gene co-expression. Interestingly, despite the similarities in terms of enriched processes, genes changing across tissues in any metric showed remarkable lack of overlap, indicating that although some processes seem to display clear conserved changes across tissues, the actual genes associated with these processes that are altered seem to be tissue-specific, highlighting the importance of interrogating processes instead of individual genes in systems level comparisons. Our results show that when combining analyses of absolute gene expression changes and gene co-expression changes some clear age-associated patterns emerge across tissues. Notably, the prominence of modules with terms that can be mechanistically linked to mTOR indicates a possible interpretation of how mTOR inhibition mediates lifespan extension.",

    "abstract": "Trees with weeping shoot architectures are valued for their beauty and serve as tremendous resources for understanding how plants regulate posture control. The Prunus persica (peach) weeping phenotype, which has elliptical downward arching branches, is caused by a homozygous mutation in the WEEP gene. Until now, little was known about the function of WEEP protein despite its high conservation throughout Plantae. Here, we present the results of anatomical, biochemical, biomechanical, physiological, and molecular experiments that provide insight into WEEP function. Our data suggest that weeping peach does not have defects in branch structure. Rather, transcriptomes from the adaxial (upper) and abaxial (lower) sides of standard and weeping branch shoot tips revealed flipped expression patterns for genes associated with early auxin response, tissue patterning, cell elongation, and tension wood development.\n\nThis suggests that WEEP promotes polar auxin transport toward the lower side during shoot gravitropic response, leading to cell elongation and tension wood development. In addition, weeping peach trees exhibited steeper root systems and faster root gravitropic response, just as barley and wheat with mutations in their WEEP homolog EGT2. This suggests that the role of WEEP in regulating lateral organ angles and orientations during gravitropism may be conserved. Additionally, size-exclusion chromatography indicated that WEEP proteins self-oligomerize, like other SAM-domain proteins. This oligomerization may be required for WEEP to function in formation of protein complexes during auxin transport. Collectively, our results from weeping peach provide new insight into polar auxin transport mechanisms associated with gravitropism and lateral shoot and root orientation.",

    "abstract": "Our study aims to investigate the dynamics of conventional memory T cells (Tconv) and regulatory T cells (Treg) following activation, and to explore potential differences between these two cell types. To achieve this, we developed advanced statistical mixed models based on mathematical models of ordinary differential equations (ODE), which allowed us to transform post-vaccination immunological processes into mathematical formulas. These models were applied on in-house data from a de novo Hepatitis B vaccination trial. By accounting for inter- and intra-individual variability, our models provided good fits for both antigen-specific Tconv and Treg cells, overcoming the challenge of studying these complex processes. Our modeling approach provided a deeper understanding of the immunological processes underlying T cell development after vaccination. Specifically, our analysis revealed several important findings regarding the dynamics of Tconv and Treg cells, as well as their relationship to seropositivity for HSV-1 and EBV, and the dynamics of antibody response to vaccination. Firstly, our modeling indicated that Tconv dynamics suggest the existence of two T cell types, in contrast to Treg dynamics where only one T cell type is predicted. Secondly, we found that individuals who converted to a positive antibody response to the vaccine earlier had lower decay rates for both Tregs and Tconv cells, which may have important implications for the development of more effective vaccination strategies. Additionally, our modeling showed that HSV-1 seropositivity negatively influenced Tconv cell expansion after the second vaccination, while EBV seropositivity was associated with higher Treg expansion rates after vaccination. Overall, this study provides a critical foundation for understanding the dynamic processes underlying T cell development after vaccination.",

    "abstract": "The functional and phenotypic heterogeneity of dendritic cells (DCs) plays a crucial role in facilitating the development of diverse immune responses that are essential for providing host protection. We found that KDM5C, a histone lysine demethylase of the KDM5 family regulates several aspects of conventional DC (cDC) and plasmacytoid DC (pDC) population heterogeneity and function. Using mice conditionally deficient in KDM5C in DCs, we found that loss of KDM5C results in an increase in Ly6C- pDCs compared to Ly6C+ pDCs. We found that Ly6C- pDCs, compared to Ly6C+ pDCs, have increased expression of cell cycle genes, decreased expression of activation markers and limited ability to produce type I interferon (IFN). Both KDM5C-deficient Ly6C- and Ly6C+ pDCs have increased expression of activation markers, however, are dysfunctional and have limited ability to produce type I IFN. For conventional cDCs, KDM5C deficiency resulted in increased proportions of cDC2Bs (CLEC12A+, ESAM-) and cDC1s, which was partly dependent on type I IFN and pDCs. Using ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, and CUT&RUN for histone marks, we found that KDM5C regulates epigenetic programming of cDC1. In the absence of KDM5C, we found an increased expression of inflammatory markers, consistent with our previous results in bone marrow-derived DCs. However, we also found a decrease in mitochondrial metabolism genes and altered expression of cDC lineage-specific genes. In response to Listeria infection, KDM5C-conditionally deficient mice mounted reduced CD8+ T cell responses, indicating that KDM5C expression in DCs is necessary for their function. Thus, KDM5C is a key regulator of DC heterogeneity by modulating the balance of DC subsets and serves as a critical driver of the epigenetic programming and functional properties of DCs.",

    "abstract": "AimTidal marsh ecosystems are heavily impacted by human activities, highlighting a pressing need to address gaps in our knowledge of their distribution. To better understand the global distribution and changes in tidal marsh extent, and identify opportunities for their conservation and restoration, it is critical to develop a spatial knowledge base of their global occurrence. Here, we develop a globally consistent tidal marsh distribution map for the year 2020 at 10-m resolution.\n\nLocationGlobal\n\nTime period2020\n\nMajor taxa studiedTidal marshes\n\nMethodsTo map the location of the worlds tidal marshes we applied a random forest classification model to earth observation data from the year 2020. We trained the classification model with a reference dataset developed to support distribution mapping of coastal ecosystems, and predicted the spatial distribution of tidal marshes between 60{degrees}N to 60{degrees}S. We validated the tidal marsh map using standard accuracy assessment methods, with our final map having an overall accuracy score of 0.852.\n\nResultsWe estimate the global extent of tidal marshes in 2020 to be 52,880 km2 (95% CI: 32,030 to 59,780 km2) distributed across 120 countries and territories. Tidal marsh distribution is centred in temperate and Arctic regions, with nearly half of the global extent of tidal marshes occurring in the temperate Northern Atlantic (45%) region. At the national scale, over a third of the global extent (18,510 km2; CI: 11,200 - 20,900) occurs within the USA.\n\nMain conclusionsOur analysis provides the most detailed spatial data on global tidal marsh distribution to date and shows that tidal marshes occur in more countries and across a greater proportion of the worlds coastline than previous mapping studies. Our map fills a major knowledge gap regarding the distribution of the worlds coastal ecosystems and provides the baseline needed for measuring changes in tidal marsh extent and estimating their value in terms of ecosystem services",

    "abstract": "AbstractAnimals shift activity periods to reduce predation, minimize competition, or exploit new resources, and this can drive sensory system evolution. But adaptive mechanisms underlying niche- shifts are poorly understood, and model organisms are often too distantly related to reveal the genetic drivers. To address this, we examined expression patterns between two closely related silk moths that have undergone temporal niche divergence. We found 200-700 differentially expressed genes, including day upregulation in eye development and visual processing genes, and night upregulation of antennal and olfactory brain development genes. Further, clusters of circadian, sensory, and brain development genes co-expressed with diel-activity. In both species, eight genes showed expression significantly correlated to diel activity, and are involved in vision, olfaction, brain development, neural plasticity, energy utilization, and cellular maintenance. We repeatedly recovered disco, a zinc- finger transcription factor involved in antennal development, circadian activity, and optic lobe brain development in flies. While disco mutants have circadian arrhythmia, most studies attribute this to improper clock neuron development, not adult circadian maintenance. Comparing predicted 3D protein structure across moth and fly genetic models revealed disco likely retained developmental function with a conserved zinc finger domain, but gained functional zinc finger domains absent in D. melanogaster. These regions have several mutations between nocturnal and diurnal species that co- occur with higher levels of predicted phosphorylation sites. With robust circadian expression, functional nocturnal and diurnal mutations, and structural and sequence conservation, we hypothesize that disco may be a master regulator contributing to diel-activity diversification in adult moths.\n\nSignificanceInsect diel-activity patterns are diverse, yet the underlying evolutionary processes are poorly understood. Light environment powerfully entrains circadian rhythms and drives diel-niche and sensory evolution. To investigate its impact, we compared gene expression in closely related day- and night-active wild silk moths, with otherwise similar ecologies. Expression patterns that varied with diel activity included genes linked to eye development, neural plasticity and cellular maintenance. Notably, disco, which encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor involved in pupal Drosophila optic lobe and antennal development, shows robust adult circadian mRNA cycling in moth heads, is highly conserved in moths, and has additional zinc-finger domains with specific nocturnal and diurnal mutations. We hypothesize that disco may contribute to diversification of adult diel-activity patterns in moths.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenome-wide association studies and next generation sequencing data analyses based on DNA information have identified thousands of mutations associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, more than 99% of identified mutations are non-coding. Thus, it is unclear which of these mutations might be functional and thus potentially causal variants. Transcriptomic profiling using total RNA-sequencing has been one of the most utilized approaches to link protein levels to genetic information at the molecular level. The transcriptome captures molecular genomic complexity that the DNA sequence solely does not. Some mutations alter a genes DNA sequence but do not necessarily change expression and/or protein function. To date, few common variants reliably associated with the diagnosis status of ASD despite consistently high estimates of heritability. In addition, reliable biomarkers used to diagnose ASD or molecular mechanisms to define the severity of ASD do not exist.\n\nObjectivesIt is necessary to integrate DNA and RNA testing together to identify true causal genes and propose useful biomarkers for ASD.\n\nMethodsWe performed gene-based association studies with adaptive test using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics with two large GWAS datasets (ASD 2019 data: 18,382 ASD cases and 27,969 controls [discovery data]; ASD 2017 data: 6,197 ASD cases and 7,377 controls [replication data]) which were obtained from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC). In addition, we investigated differential expression for genes identified in gene-based GWAS with a RNA-seq dataset (GSE30573: 3 cases and 3 controls) using the DESeq2 package.\n\nResultsWe identified 5 genes significantly associated with ASD in ASD 2019 data (KIZ-AS1, p=8.67x10-10; KIZ, p=1.16x10-9; XRN2, p=7.73x10-9; SOX7, p=2.22x10-7; PINX1-DT, p=2.14x10-6). Among these 5 genes, gene SOX7 (p=0.00087), LOC101929229 (p=0.009), and KIZ-AS1 (p=0.059) were replicated in ASD 2017 data. KIZ (p=0.06) was close to the boundary of replication in ASD 2017 data. Genes SOX7 (p=0.0017, adjusted p=0.0085), LOC101929229 (also known as PINX1-DT, p=5.83x10-7, adjusted p=1.18x10-5), and KIZ (p=0.00099, adjusted p=0.0055) indicated significant expression differences between cases and controls in the RNA-seq data. SOX7 encodes a member of the SOX (SRY-related HMG-box) family of transcription factors pivotally contributing to determining of the cell fate and identity in many lineages. The encoded protein may act as a transcriptional regulator after forming a protein complex with other proteins leading to autism.\n\nConclusionGene SOX7 in the transcription factor family could be associated with ASD. This finding may provide new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for ASD.",

Therefore, separating the extracellular fluid from its cytosolic counterpart has often been performed using a costly double-bilayer setup. Here, we demonstrate that the lipid membrane and solvent asymmetry can be efficiently modeled with a single lipid bilayer by applying a flat-bottom potential to ions and other solute molecules, thereby restraining them to only interact with its relevant leaflet. We carefully optimized the parameters of the suggested method so that the results obtained using the flat-bottom and double-bilayer approaches become mutually indistinguishable. Then, we apply the flat-bottom approach to lipid bilayers with various compositions and solvent environments, covering ions and cationic peptides to validate the approach in a realistic use case. We also discuss the possible limitations of the method as well as its computational efficiency and provide a step-by-step guide on how to set up such simulations in a straightforward manner.",

    "abstract": "The planulae larvae of cnidarians (jellyfish, hydras, anemones, corals) have attracted interest since Haeckels 150-year-old postulation of the gastrula developmental stage of sponges and corals as the terminal lifeform of primitive multicellular metazoans. Widely viewed as primarily particle feeders, the planulae larvae of the anemone Exaiptasia pallida (commonly Aiptasia) have not been reported to undergo settlement and metamorphosis to adult morphology, and the lack of a closed lifecycle has been a major obstacle in this increasingly popular model system for coral-dinoflagellate endosymbiosis. Here we studied Aiptasia larvae feeding behavior and show its indispensability to trigger the first reports of settlement and metamorphosis in the system, finally closing the Aiptasia lifecycle. Surprisingly, the young gastrula-like planulae at just two days post fertilization actively feed on living crustacean nauplii, preferentially to heat-killed ones. Predation is dependent on functional stinging cells (nematocytes), indicative of complex neuronal control. Larvae fed daily dramatically increase in size and at 14 days post fertilization begin to morphologically change prior to settlement at high efficiency. Strikingly, dinoflagellate endosymbionts are neither required for larval growth nor measurably affect settlement dynamics, but are essential for spawning of the mature adult polyps. Our data show for the first time that gastrula-like planulae were capable of prey capture, suggesting carnivory in addition to filter feeding as a common strategy of this terminal life form. These data are discussed in the context of recent revelations on the evolution of basal metazoans.",

    "abstract": "Bacillus species are ubiquitous in nature and have tremendous application potential in agriculture, medicine, and industry. However, the individual species of this genus vary widely in both ecological niches and functional phenotypes, which, hence, requires accurate classification of these bacteria when selecting them for specific purposes. Although analysis of the 16S gene has been widely used to disseminate the taxonomy of most bacterial species, this gene fails proper classification of Bacillus species. To circumvent this restriction, we designed novel primers and optimized them to allow exact species resolution of Bacillus species in both synthetic and natural communities using high-throughput amplicon sequencing. The primers designed for the tuf gene were not only specific for the Bacillus genus but also sufficiently discriminated species both in silico and in vitro in a mixture of 11 distinct Bacillus species. Investigating the primers using a natural soil sample, 13 dominant species were detected including Bacillus badius, Bacillus velezensis, and Bacillus mycoides as primary members, neither of which could be distinguished with 16S sequencing. In conclusion, a set of high-throughput primers were developed which allows unprecedented species-level identification of Bacillus species, including agriculturally important species.",

Regular discharges of tannery effluents into land and open water have led to significant soil and water pollution, with one of the most dangerous inorganic pollutants being chromium (Cr). This study aims to recover the most harmful components from industrial water using efficient biosorbents. Brevibacillus brevis US575 has been initially found in tannery effluents, where it has a high tolerance level to Cr6+ ions. The Cr(VI) adsorbed from the solution in aqueous phase during the course of the 60-minute contact period in this experiment was nearly 74%. Studies on the concentration of biomass, pH of the medium, and the starting concentration of metal ions have also been seen to affect the rate of biosorption. According to the desorption investigation, 1 M HCl outperformed all other concentrations of HCl, NaOH and pure water. Highest capacity of adsorption of the bio-adsorbent was calculated using the Langmuir model. The monolayer adsorption process was determined, and since the Freundlich models 1/n value fell inside 1, favourable adsorption has been postulated. According to the results of this study, the bacterium isolated from tannery wastewater was found to be the best alternative and could be used to create plans for using biosorption to combat current environmental pollution.",

    "abstract": "In the Japanese hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri, approximately 21% of the genomic DNA in germ cells (2n=52) consists of 16 chromosomes (eliminated [E]-chromosomes) that are eliminated from presumptive somatic cells (2n=36). To uncover the eliminated genome (E-genome), we have identified 16 eliminated repetitive DNA families from eight hagfish species, with 11 of these repeats being selectively amplified in the germline genome of E. burgeri. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that six of these sequences, namely EEEb1-6, are exclusively localized on all 16 E-chromosomes. This has led to the hypothesis that the eight pairs of E-chromosomes are derived from one pair of ancestral chromosomes via multiple duplication events over a prolonged evolutionary period. NGS analysis has recently facilitated the re-assembly of two distinct draft genomes of E. burgeri, derived from the testis and liver. This advancement allows for the prediction of not only nonrepetitive eliminated sequences but also over 100 repetitive and eliminated sequences, accomplished through K-mer-based analysis. In this study, we report four novel eliminated repetitive DNA sequences (designated as EEEb7-10) and confirm the relative chromosomal localization of all eliminated repeats (EEEb1-10) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). With the exception of EEEb10, all sequences were exclusively detected on EEEb1-positive chromosomes. Surprisingly, EEEb10 was detected as an intense signal on EEEb1-positive chromosomes and as a scattered signal on other chromosomes in germ cells. The study further divided the eight pairs of E-chromosomes into six groups based on the signal distribution of each DNA family, and fiber-FISH experiments showed that the EEEb2-10 family was dispersed in the EEEb1-positive extended chromatin fiber. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying chromosome elimination and the evolution of E-chromosomes, supporting our previous hypothesis.",

To quantify how variation in the activity of one enzyme constrains the biochemical parameters and sequence of another, we focused on dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and thymidylate synthase (TYMS), a pair of enzymes catalyzing consecutive reactions in folate metabolism. We used deep mutational scanning to quantify the growth rate effect of 2,696 DHFR single mutations in 3 TYMS backgrounds under conditions selected to emphasize biochemical epistasis. Our data are well-described by a relatively simple enzyme velocity to growth rate model that quantifies how metabolic context tunes enzyme mutational tolerance. Together our results reveal the structural distribution of epistasis in a metabolic enzyme and establish a foundation for the design of multi-enzyme systems.",

    "abstract": "High-field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) separates glycopeptides in the gas phase prior to mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, thus offering the potential to analyze glycopeptides without prior enrichment. Several studies have demonstrated the ability of FAIMS to enhance glycopeptide detection but have primarily focused on N-glycosylation. Here, we evaluated FAIMS for O-glycoprotein and mucin-domain glycoprotein analysis using samples of varying complexity. We demonstrated that FAIMS was useful in increasingly complex samples, as it allowed for the identification of more glycosylated species. However, during our analyses, we observed a phenomenon called \"in FAIMS fragmentation\" (IFF) akin to in source fragmentation but occurring during FAIMS separation. FAIMS experiments showed a 2-5-fold increase in spectral matches from IFF compared to control experiments. These results were also replicated in previously published data, indicating that this is likely a systemic occurrence when using FAIMS. Our study highlights that although there are potential benefits to using FAIMS separation, caution must be exercised in data analysis because of prevalent IFF, which may limit its applicability in the broader field of O-glycoproteomics.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/542648v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (51K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d94300org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bdc6dforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4b8ea8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@82beed_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Lipid metabolism is implicated in a variety of diseases, including cancer, cell death, and inflammation, but lipidomics has proven to be challenging due to the vast structural diversity over a narrow range of mass and polarity of lipids. Isotope labeling is often used in metabolomics studies to follow the metabolism of exogenously added labeled compounds because they can be differentiated from endogenous compounds by the mass shift associated with the label. The application of isotope labeling to lipidomics has also been explored as a method to track the metabolism of lipids in various disease states. However, it can be difficult to differentiate a single isotopically labeled lipid from the rest of the lipidome due to the variety of endogenous lipids present over the same mass range. Here we report the development of a dual-isotope deuterium labeling method to track the metabolic fate of exogenous polyunsaturated fatty acids, e.g, arachidonic acid (AA), in the context of ferroptosis using hydrophilic interaction-ion mobility-mass spectrometry (HILIC-IM-MS). Ferroptosis is a type of cell death that is dependent on lipid peroxidation. The use of two isotope labels rather than one enables the identification of labeled species by a signature doublet peak in the resulting mass spectra. A Python-based software, D-Tracer, was developed to efficiently extract metabolites with dual-isotope labels. The labeled species were then identified with Lipydomics based on their retention times, collision cross section, and m/z values. Changes in exogenous AA incorporation in the absence and presence of a ferroptosis inducer were elucidated.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=82 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/542640v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (15K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6bbc67org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11e3a84org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@193ce6eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d5b757_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "AbstractActin is essential for various cellular functions such as growth, migration, and endocytosis. Recent evidence suggests that several actin-binding proteins phase separate to form condensates and that actin networks have different architectures in these droplets. In this study, we use computational modeling to investigate the conditions under which actin forms different network organizations in VASP droplets. Our simulations reveal that the binding and unbinding rates of actin and VASP determine the probability of formation of shells and rings, with shells being more probable than rings. The different actin networks are highly dependent on the kinetics of VASP-actin interactions, suggesting that they arise from kinetic trapping. Specifically, we showed that reducing the residence time of VASP on actin filaments promotes assembly of shells rather than rings, where rings require a greater degree of actin bundling. These predictions were tested experimentally using a mutant of VASP, which has decreased bundling capability. Experiments reveal an increase in the abundance of shells in VASP droplets, consistent with our predictions. Finally, we investigated the arrangements of filaments within deformed droplets and found that the filament length largely determines whether a droplet will straighten into a bundle or remain kinetically trapped in a ring-like architecture. The sphere-to-ellipsoid transition is favored under a wide range of conditions while the ellipse-to-rod transition is only permitted when filaments have a specific range of lengths. Our findings have implications for understanding how the interactions between phase-separated actin binding proteins and actin filaments can give rise to different actin network architectures.",

Moreover, using a combination of single molecule and bulk level techniques, we identify secondary nucleation on the surfaces of existing fibrils, rather than formation directly from monomers, as the dominant source of oligomers.

    "abstract": "Since the discovery of natural malaria vector populations infected by the endosymbiont bacterium Wolbachia, a renewed interest has arisen for using this bacterium as an alternative for malaria control. Among naturally infected mosquitoes, Anopheles moucheti, a major malaria mosquito in Central Africa, exhibits one of the highest prevalences of Wolbachia infection. To better understand whether this maternally inherited bacterium could be used for malaria control, we investigated Wolbachia influence in An. moucheti populations naturally infected by the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. To this end, we collected mosquitoes in a village from Cameroon, Central Africa, where this mosquito is the main malaria vector. We found that the prevalence of Wolbachia bacterium was almost fixed in the studied mosquito population, and was higher than previously recorded. We also quantified Wolbachia in whole mosquitoes and dissected abdomens, confirming that the bacterium is also elsewhere than in the abdomen, but at lower density. Finally, we analyzed the impact of Wolbachia presence and density on P. falciparum infection. Wolbachia density was slightly higher in mosquitoes infected with the malaria parasite than in uninfected mosquitoes. However, we observed no correlation between the P. falciparum and Wolbachia densities. In conclusion, our study indicates that naturally occurring Wolbachia infection does not affect P. falciparum development within An. moucheti mosquitoes.",

Previous studies using laser microsurgery suggested that elastic tethers connect the telomeres of separating anaphase chromosomes in many animal meiotic and mitotic cells. However, structural evidence is lacking for their existence. In this study, we correlated live imaging with electron tomography of crane-fly primary spermatocytes to examine whether visible structures connect separating telomeres in meiosis I. We found structures extending between separating telomeres in all stages of anaphase, from very early anaphase to late anaphase. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that the structures consist of two components: one is darkly stained, looking somewhat like chromatin, whereas the other is more lightly stained, appearing filamentous with internal thinner filaments. While in early anaphase both structures extend between telomeres, in later anaphase the darker structure extends shorter distances from the telomeres but the lighter structure still extends between the separating telomeres. From these observations, we deduced that these structures represent the  tethers inferred from the laser-cutting experiments in crane-fly spermatocytes. Since the presence of elastic tethers are suggested in a variety of animal cells, they probably are present during anaphase in all animal cells.",

    "abstract": "Migratory birds generally have tightly scheduled annual cycles, in which delays can have carry-over effects on the timing of later events, ultimately impacting reproductive output. We tested whether migration schedules among eight breeding populations of Arctic Skuas Stercorarius parasiticus between Greenland and Siberia differ as a function of their use of seven widely divergent wintering areas across the Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean, and predicted that migrations over larger distances, with tighter schedules, would provide less room for compensating delays. Breeding at higher latitudes led not only to later reproduction and migration, but also faster spring migration and shorter time between return to the breeding area and clutch initiation. Wintering area was consistent within individuals among years; and more distant areas were associated with more time spent on migration and less time in the wintering areas. Skuas adjusted the period spent in the non-breeding area, regardless of the migration distance, which overall buffered the variation in timing of autumn migration. The lack of a consistent effect of wintering area on timing of return to land between breeding areas indicates that individuals synchronize their arrival with others in their population despite extensive individual differences in migration strategies.",

However, the relationship between PdiTPSs and the specificity or promiscuity of their products remains unclear. To explore this correlation, the sequences of 199 functionally characterized PdiTPSs and their corresponding 3D structures were collected and manually corrected. Using this compiled annotated database, the correlations among PdiTPSs sequences, domains, structures and their corresponding products were comprehensively analyzed. However, utilizing sequence similarity network (SSN), phylogenetic trees, and structural topology features alone was insufficient for effective functional classification of PdiTPSs as these methods could not establish a clear mapping between the enzymes and products. Surprisingly, residues verified to play a function through mutagenesis experiments were located within 8[A] of the substrate. Aromatic residues surrounding the substrate exhibited selectivity towards its chemical structure. Specifically, tryptophan (W) was preferentially located around the linear substrate geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), while phenylalanine (F) and tyrosine (Y) were preferentially located around the initial cyclized diterpene intermediate. This analysis revealed the functional space of residues surrounding the substrate of PdiTPSs, most of which have not been experimentally explored. These findings provide guidance for screening specific residues for mutation studies to change the catalytic products of PdiTPSs, allowing us to better understand the correlation between PdiTPSs and their products.",

IgE- expressing cells can be generated through a sequential class switching pathway where activated B cells first switch to an intermediary isotype, most frequently IgG1, and then to IgE. It has been proposed that sequential class switch recombination is important in generating high affinity IgE, augmenting anaphylactic reactions, and in holding the memory of IgE responses. Here, we observed surprising redundancy of sequential switching through IgG1 for the functional affinity of the IgE repertoire against multiple food allergens as well as for the ability of IgE to elicit anaphylaxis. We further found that sequential switching via IgG1 was irrelevant for allergic memory. These results indicate that allergen-specific IgG1 B cells are redundant in sensitization, anaphylaxis, and food allergy persistence, thereby implicating other switching pathways as important considerations in the development of therapeutics for allergic diseases.",

While theory and experimental work has focused on range expansions across uniform environments, natural range expansions often occur over environmental gradients, which present novel selection pressures. We seek to understand how genetic variation expressed in different environments may constrain adaptation during range expansion across environmental gradients, by testing whether long-established populations are better adapted to their local environments than newly established populations in the expanding edge. We study the timing of winter dormancy in a beetle introduced for biological control (Diorhabda carinulata), expanding from areas with cold winters to areas with milder, shorter winters. In a reciprocal environment experiment, core populations showed a pattern of local adaptation, but only some edge populations showed a similar pattern, indicating these populations vary in their degree of adaptation. Expressed genetic variation of dormancy timing in a core population was high in a local (core) environment but disappeared in a novel (edge) environment. These results show that adaptive evolution has been rapid, likely fueled by high heritability, but long-distance movement may hinder adaptation by reducing the heritable genetic variation on which selection can act.",

    "abstract": "Biomolecular condensates play a crucial role in regulating gene expression, but their behavior in chromatin remains poorly understood. Classical theories of phase separation are limited to thermal equilibrium, and traditional methods can only simulate a limited number of condensates. In this paper, we introduce a novel mean-field-like method that allows us to simulate millions of condensates in a heterogeneous elastic medium to model the dynamics of transcriptional condensates in chromatin. Using this method, we unveil an elastic ripening process in which the average condensate radius exhibits a unique temporal scaling, [&lt;]R[&gt;] [~] t1/5, different from the classical Ostwald ripening, and we theoretically derive the exponent based on energy conservation and scale invariance. We also introduce active dissolution to model the degradation of transcriptional condensates upon RNA accumulation. Surprisingly, three different kinetics of condensate growth emerge, corresponding to constitutively expressed, transcriptional-bursting, and silenced genes. Notably, multiple distributions of transcriptional-bursting kinetics from simulations, e.g., the burst frequency, agree with transcriptome-wide experimental data. Furthermore, the timing of growth initiation can be synchronized among bursting condensates, with power-law scaling between the synchronization period and dissolution rate. Our results shed light on the complex interplay between biomolecular condensates and the elastic medium, with important implications for gene expression regulation.",

    "abstract": "Episodic memory, or memory of experienced events, is a critical function of the hippocampus1-3. It is therefore important to understand how hippocampal activity represents specific events in an animals life. We addressed this question in chickadees - specialist food-caching birds that hide food at scattered locations and use memory to find their caches later in time4, 5. We performed high-density neural recordings in the hippocampus of chickadees as they cached and retrieved seeds in a laboratory arena. We found that each caching event was represented by a burst of firing in a unique set of hippocampal neurons. These  barcode-like patterns of activity were sparse (<10% of neurons active), uncorrelated even for immediately adjacent caches, and different even for separate caches at the same location. The barcode representing a specific caching event was transiently reactivated whenever a bird later interacted with the same cache - for example, to retrieve food. Barcodes co-occurred with conventional place cell activity6, 7, as well as location-independent responses to cached seeds. We propose that barcodes are signatures of episodic memories evoked during memory recall. These patterns assign a unique identifier to each event and may be a mechanism for rapid formation and storage of many non-interfering memories.",

    "abstract": "Perception requires binding spatiotemporally congruent multimodal sensory stimuli. The auditory cortex (AC) sends projections to the primary visual cortex (V1), which could provide signals for binding spatially corresponding audio-visual stimuli. However, it is unknown whether AC inputs in V1 encode sound location. We used dual-color two-photon axonal calcium imaging and an array of speakers to measure the auditory spatial information that AC transmits to V1. We found that AC relays information about the location of ipsilateral and contralateral sound sources to V1. Sound location could be accurately decoded by sampling AC axons in V1, providing a substrate for making location-specific audiovisual associations. However, AC inputs were not retinotopically arranged in V1, and audio-visual modulations of V1 neurons did not depend on the spatial congruency of the sound and light stimuli. The distributed, non-topographic sound localization signals provided by AC might allow the association of specific audiovisual spatial patterns in V1 neurons.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Fabry disease suffer from chronic debilitating pain and peripheral sensory neuropathy with minimal treatment options, but the cellular drivers of this pain are unknown. Here, we propose a novel mechanism by which altered signaling between Schwann cells and sensory neurons underlies the peripheral sensory nerve dysfunction we observe in a genetic rat model of Fabry disease. Using in vivo and in vitro electrophysiological recordings, we demonstrate that Fabry rat sensory neurons exhibit pronounced hyperexcitability. Schwann cells likely contribute to this finding as application of mediators released from cultured Fabry Schwann cells induces spontaneous activity and hyperexcitability in naive sensory neurons. We examined putative algogenic mediators using proteomic analysis and found that Fabry Schwann cells release elevated levels of the protein p11 (S100-A10) which induces sensory neuron hyperexcitability. Removal of p11 from Fabry Schwann cell media causes hyperpolarization of neuronal resting membrane potential, indicating that p11 contributes to the excessive neuronal excitability caused by Fabry Schwann cells. These findings demonstrate that rats with Fabry disease exhibit sensory neuron hyperexcitability caused in part by Schwann cell release of the protein p11.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=170 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/542493v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (41K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f672f1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f42f45org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14b9806org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e9bee3_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThe sensory detection of food and food cues suppresses Agouti related peptide (AgRP) neuronal activity prior to consumption with greatest suppression in response to high caloric food or energy need. Although external sensory cues regulate AgRP neuronal activity, the interoceptive mechanisms priming an appropriate AgRP neural response to sensory information of caloric availability remain unexplored. Since hunger increases plasma ghrelin, we hypothesized that ghrelin receptor (GHSR) signalling on AgRP neurons is a key interoceptive mechanism integrating energy need with external sensory cues predicting caloric availability.\n\nMethodsWe used in vivo photometry to measure the effects of ghrelin administration or fasting on AgRP neural activity with GCaMP6s and dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens with GRAB-DA in mice lacking ghrelin receptors in AgRP neurons.\n\nResultsThe deletion of GHSR on AgRP neurons prevented ghrelin-induced food intake, motivation and AgRP activity. The presentation of food (peanut butter pellet) or a wooden dowel suppressed AgRP activity in fasted WT but not mice lacking GHSRs in AgRP neurons. Similarly, peanut butter and a wooden dowel increased dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens after ip ghrelin injection in WT but not mice lacking GHSRs in AgRP neurons. No difference in dopamine release was observed in fasted mice. Finally, ip ghrelin administration did not directly increase dopamine neural activity in the ventral tegmental area.\n\nConclusionsOur results suggest that AgRP GHSRs integrate an interoceptive state of energy need with external sensory information to produce an optimal change in AgRP neural activity. Thus, ghrelin signalling on AgRP neurons is more than just a feedback signal to increase AgRP activity during hunger.",
