    "abstract": "High pathogenicity avian influenza virus (HPAIV) caused the worst seabird mass-mortalities on record in Europe across 2021-2022. The northern gannet (Morus bassanus) was one of the most affected species, with tens of thousands of casualties in the northeast Atlantic between April-September 2022. Disease outbreaks can drastically modify the movement ecology of animals and diminish spatial consistency, thereby increasing the potential for disease transmission. To detect potential changes in movement behaviour, we GPS-tracked breeding adults following the initial HPAIV outbreak, at three of the largest gannet breeding colonies where major mortality of adults and chicks occurred (Bass Rock, Scotland, UK; Grassholm, Wales, UK; Rouzic island, Brittany, France). Crucially, GPS-tracked birds remained faithful to their breeding sites and did not prospect other breeding colonies. They performed regular foraging trips at sea, similar to their behaviour before the outbreak. Gannet foraging effort was nonetheless lower than in 2019, thus surviving birds may have benefited from reduced intra- and interspecific food competition. Breeding colony fidelity of adult northern gannets following HPAIV mass-mortalities suggests limited long-term capacity to virus spread, which may contrast with the behaviour of adults during the disease outbreak, or with that of younger individuals.",

    "abstract": "A Marine Protected Area (MPA) network, in which multiple reserves are designated in a region, can promote the protection of biodiversity across space. To be effective as a network, the design must consider whether MPAs are likely to be connected through the movement of individuals of species of interest. Additionally, network design may explicitly incorporate design features that promote biodiversity in unprotected habitats through the dispersal or spillover of multiple species. Patterns of dispersal and the ability of MPAs to function as an interacting network, however, are difficult to estimate at broad and transboundary spatial scales, and therefore connectivity is often not fully integrated in the design and assessment of MPA networks. Here, we model the dispersal of multiple nearshore species to estimate the potential connectivity of the existing MPAs in British Columbia, Canada, including connections to MPAs in the United States by simulating dispersal using a biophysical model with regional oceanographic currents. We found that MPAs in BC potentially meet connectivity design criteria for nearshore invertebrate species: the majority of MPAs (65-90%) are likely to exchange individuals (i.e. functional connectivity) and support persistent metapopulations, and more than half the unprotected coast (55-85%) receives a large proportion of the larvae produced in MPAs. Furthermore, we found that species dispersal abilities and the level of exposure of an MPA to open ocean can predict dispersal distance when we account for the random effects of dispersal location and season. Therefore, future predictions of connectivity are possible based on these core biological and physical attributes, without running new simulations. Together, these analyses provide a robust and novel assessment of multi-species connectivity that can support the design of new MPAs with transboundary connectivity on the northwest coast of North America.",

    "abstract": "Lunulites are a polyphyletic group of marine bryozoans that have been a conspicuous element of marine shelf faunas since the Late Cretaceous into the present day. They are easily recognizable by their domed colony form and free-living mode of life on sea floor sediments. Here we explore the waxing and waning of the major lunulitiform groups and their unique morphology and mode of life from the Cretaceous to the present day. Because relatively few and simple modifications are needed to transition from an encrusting form into this highly specialized lifestyle, shared colonial features are rampant and we find examples of both convergent and iterative evolution across several unrelated clades, although detailed phylogenetic relationship remain largely unresolved. The early chapter of the  lunulite story is focused on the Late Cretaceous European Chalk Sea, which appears to have been a crucible for the evolution of  lunulites. At least six, and likely more, cheilostome groups independently evolved the free-living mode of life in this tropical shelf area. To what extent any of these free-living clades gave rise to post-Cretaceous groups remains unclear. The Cenozoic chapter is more complex, comprising at least three independently evolved major clades, two of which are extant; (1) the Lunulitidae s. str., a North American/European cluster, comprising the classic Lunulites, which became extinct in the late Neogene, (2) the Cupuladriidae, which reached circum-global tropical and sub-tropical distribution in the Miocene, and (3) the  Austral lunulite cluster, which is almost certainly polyphyletic and through most of its history confined to Australia and New Zealand, bar a comparatively brief colonization of the southern part of South America, with the earliest representatives from NW Western Australia.",

    "abstract": "Increased habitat fragmentation is one of the major global changes affecting biodiversity. It is characterised by a decrease in habitat availability and by an increase in the isolation of suitable habitat patches. The dispersal capacities of species may evolve in response to increased habitat fragmentation. Spatial heterogeneities and/or costs of dispersal, which are directly linked to habitat fragmentation, tend to select for lower dispersal abilities. We studied the effects of habitat fragmentation on dispersal using an ant species that exhibits a marked dispersal polymorphism. Myrmecina graminicola produces winged queens dispersing by flight over long distances, or apterous queens dispersing on foot over short distances. We sampled queens in 24 forests around Paris and 25 parks within Paris, representing varied levels of habitat fragmentation and habitat size. We identified the queen morphotypes in each environment and used it as a proxy of dispersal. Winged queens predominated in both environments. However, apterous queens were comparatively more common in parks than in forests, suggesting that high fragmentation counterselects dispersal in this species. We argue that this is because dispersing within urban environments is very costly and discuss the factors favouring each queen morph or resulting in their co-occurrence (maintenance of polymorphism).",

    "abstract": "Sex-specific lifespan dimorphism is observed in many species, with females often outliving males. This is thought to be due to sex-specific and unequal resource allocation between reproduction and maintenance. However, most studies on ageing focus on animals with traditional sex roles, where females have the highest energy burden with both egg production and parental care. This leaves a gap in our understanding of how resource allocation and senescence are linked in species with non-traditional roles. To address this, we investigated the relationship between sex (biological) and sex role (behavioural) on resource allocation trade-offs in somatic maintenance in the broad-nosed pipefish Syngnathus typhle. This species is sex-role reversed, with males acting as the primary caretaker for offspring through their unique male pregnancy, providing the opportunity to decouple the roles of sex and sex role in resource allocation. Our results suggest that while some gene groups are influenced by sex roles (e.g., genome maintenance and immune defence), others depend on biological sex and hormones (e.g., energy and fat storage), with differences becoming more pronounced with age. These findings challenge traditional ageing theories and improve our understanding of how sex-specific differences in ageing are shaped.",

    "abstract": "Endosymbiosis - where a microbe lives and replicates within a host - is an important contributor to organismal function that has accelerated evolutionary innovations and catalysed the evolution of complex life. The evolutionary processes associated with transitions to endosymbiosis, however, are poorly understood. Here, we use comparative genomics of the genus Arsenophonus to reveal the complex processes that occur on evolution of an endosymbiotic lifestyle. We compared the genomes of 38 strains spanning diverse lifestyles from environmentally acquired infections to obligate inter-dependent endosymbionts. We observed recent endosymbionts had larger genome sizes than closely related environmentally acquired strains, consistent with evolutionary innovation and rapid gain of new function. Increased genome size was a consequence of prophage and plasmid acquisition including a cargo of type III effectors, and concomitant loss of CRISPR-Cas genome defence systems enabling mobile genetic element expansion. Persistent endosymbiosis was also associated with loss of type VI secretion, likely reflecting reduced microbe-microbe competition. Thereafter, the transition to stable endosymbiosis and vertical inheritance was associated with the expected relaxation of purifying selection, pseudogenisation of genes and reduction of metabolism, leading to genome reduction. However, reduced %GC that is typically considered a progressive linear process was observed only in obligate interdependent endosymbionts. We argue that a combination of the need for rapid horizontal gene transfer-mediated evolutionary innovation together with reduced phage predation in endosymbiotic niches drives loss of genome defence systems and rapid genome expansion upon adoption of endosymbiosis. These remodelling processes precede the reductive evolution traditionally associated with adaptation to endosymbiosis.",

    "abstract": "The efficiency and outcome of CRISPR/Cas9 editing depends on the chromatin state at the cut site. It has been shown that changing the chromatin state can influence both the efficiency and repair outcome, and epigenetic drugs have been used to improve Cas9 editing. However, because the target proteins of these drugs are not homogeneously distributed across the genome, the efficacy of these drugs may be expected to vary from locus to locus. Here, we systematically analyzed this chromatin context-dependency for 160 epigenetic drugs. We used a human cell line with 19 stably integrated reporters to induce a double-stranded break (DSB) in different chromatin environments. We then measure Cas9 editing efficiency and repair pathway usage by sequencing the mutational signatures. We identified 67 drugs that modulate Cas9 editing efficiency and/or repair outcome dependent on the local chromatin environment. For example, we find a subset of histone deacetylase inhibitors that improve Cas9 editing efficiency throughout all types of heterochromatin (e.g., PCI-24781), while others were only effective in H3K27me3-marked regions (e.g., Vorinostat). In summary, this study reveals that most epigenetic drugs alter CRISPR editing in a chromatin-dependent manner, and provides a detailed guide to improve Cas9 editing more selectively at the desired location.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIA screen identifies dozens of drugs that alter Cas9 editing in a chromatin context-dependent manner\nC_LIO_LIMany HDAC inhibitors boost Cas9 editing efficiency throughout all types of heterochromatin\nC_LIO_LIThe DNMT inhibitor Decitabine completely blocks resection-dependent repair across the genome\nC_LI",

Sperm can be stored in the female reproductive tract for extended periods of time. However, its role in regulating female behavior is poorly understood. In the androdioecious nematode C. elegans, hermaphrodites produce both egg cells and sperm, enabling them to self-fertilize or mate with males. Hermaphrodites exhibit less locomotor activity compared to males, indicating sex difference in behavioral regulation. In this study, sperm-deficient mutants were examined to investigate the role of sperm in the regulation of locomotor behavior. The results suggest that sperm plays a significant role in regulating sex-shared behavior in C. elegans, as sperm-deficient mutants exhibited increased locomotor activity. Additionally, females of closely related gonochoristic species, C. remanei and C. brenneri, exhibited reduced locomotor activity after mating. The regulation of locomotion by sperm may be an adaptive mechanism that enables sperm-less hermaphrodites to search for mates and allow females to cease their search for mates after mating.",

    "abstract": "Living materials that combine active cells and synthetic matrix materials have become a promising research field in recent years. While multicellular systems present exclusive benefits in developing living materials over single-cell systems, creating artificial multicellular systems can be challenging due to the difficulty in controlling the multicellular assemblies and the complexity of cell-to-cell interactions. Here, we propose a co-culture platform capable of isolating and controlling the spatial distribution of algal-bacterial consortia, which can be used to construct photosynthetic living fibers. Through coaxial extrusion-based 3D printing, hydrogel fibers containing bacteria or algae can be deposited into designated structures and further processed into materials with precise geometries. In addition, the photosynthetic living fibers demonstrate a significant synergistic catalytic effect resulting from the immobilization of both bacteria and algae, which effectively optimize sewage treatment for bioremediation purposes. The integration of microbial consortia and 3D printing gives functional living materials that have promising applications in biocatalysis, biosensing, and biomedicine. Our approach provides an optimized solution for constructing efficient multicellular systems and opens a new avenue for the development of advanced materials.",

To test this hypothesis, we assessed MAG recovery in three in silico microbial communities composed of 42 species with the same richness but different sample evenness, sequencing depth and taxonomic distribution profiles using three different pipelines for MAG recovery.\n\nThe pipeline developed by Parks and colleagues (8K) generated the highest number of MAGs and the lowest number of true positives per community profile. The pipeline by Karst and colleagues (DT) showed the most accurate results ([~] 92%), outperforming the 8K and Multi-Metagenome pipeline (MM) developed by Albertsen and collaborators. Sequencing depth influenced the accurate recovery of genomes when using the 8K and MM, even with contrasting patterns: the MM pipeline recovered more MAGs found in the original communities when employing sequencing depths up to 60 million reads, whilst the 8K recovered more true positives in communities sequenced above 60 million reads. DT showed the best species recovery from the same genus, even though close-related species have a low recovery rate in all pipelines.\n\nOur results highlight that more bins do not translate to the actual community composition and that sequencing depth plays a role in MAG recovery and increased community resolution.

    "abstract": "BackgroundRepolarization alternans, defined as period-2 oscillation in the repolarization phase of the action potentials, is one of the cornerstones of cardiac electrophysiology as it provides a mechanistic link between cellular dynamics and ventricular fibrillation (VF). Theoretically, higher-order periodicities (e.g., period-4, period-8,...) are expected but have very limited experimental evidence.\n\nMethodsWe studied explanted human hearts, obtained from the recipients of heart transplantation at the time of surgery, using optical mapping technique with transmembrane voltage-sensitive fluorescent dyes. The hearts were stimulated at an increasing rate until VF was induced. The signals recorded from the right ventricle endocardial surface just before the induction of VF and in the presence of 1:1 conduction were processed using the Principal Component Analysis and a combinatorial algorithm to detect and quantify higher-order dynamics.\n\nResultsA prominent and statistically significant 1:4 peak (corresponding to period-4 dynamics) was seen in three of the six studied hearts. Local analysis revealed the spatiotemporal distribution of higher-order periods. Period-4 was localized to temporally stable islands. Higher-order oscillations (period-5, 6, and 8) were transient and primarily occurred in arcs parallel to the activation isochrones.\n\nDiscussionWe present evidence of higher-order periodicities and the co-existence of such regions with stable non-chaotic areas in ex-vivo human hearts before VF induction. This result is consistent with the period-doubling route to chaos as a possible mechanism of VF initiation, which complements the concordant to discordant alternans mechanism. The presence of higher-order regions may act as niduses of instability that can degenerate into chaotic fibrillation.",

Some of the mechanisms underlying these relapses include poor CAR T cell cytotoxicity or persistence, as well as antigen loss or lineage switching in tumor cells. In order to investigate how antigen-mediated resistance mechanisms affect therapy outcomes, we develop a mathematical model based on a set of integral-partial differential equations. Using a continuous variable to describe the level of antigen expression of tumor cells, we recapitulated important cellular mechanisms across patients with different therapeutic responses. Fitted with clinical data, the model successfully captured the dynamics of tumor and CAR-T cells for several hematological cancers. Furthermore, the role played by these mechanisms are explored with regard to different biological scenarios, such as pre-existing or acquired mutations, providing a deeper understanding of key factors underlying resistance to CAR-T cell immunotherapy.\n\nStatement of significanceOur study introduces the first mathematical model to characterize the influence of a continuous level of antigen expression on the interplay between Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T cells and cancer cells. We examine various cellular mechanisms across different hematologic cancers, taking into account both antigen-positive and antigen-negative relapses. Our findings shed light on the role of antigen density in CAR-T cell therapies and provide a valuable framework to investigate resistance with potential to improve patients outcomes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCardiac optical mapping is an imaging technique that measures fluorescent signals across a cardiac preparation. Dual optical mapping of voltage-sensitive and calcium-sensitive probes allow for simultaneous recordings of cardiac action potentials and intracellular calcium transients with high spatiotemporal resolution. The analysis of these complex optical datasets is both time intensive and technically challenging; as such, we have developed a software package for semi-automated image processing and analysis. Herein, we report an updated version of our software package (KairoSight-3.0) with features to enhance characterization of cardiac parameters using optical signals.\n\nMethodsTo test software validity and applicability, we used Langendorff-perfused heart preparations to record transmembrane voltage and intracellular calcium signals from the epicardial surface. Isolated hearts from guinea pigs and rats were loaded with a potentiometric dye (RH237) and/or calcium indicator dye (Rhod-2AM) and fluorescent signals were acquired. We used Python 3.8.5 programming language to develop the KairoSight-3.0 software. Cardiac maps were validated with a user-specified manual mapping approach.\n\nResultsManual maps of action potential duration (30 or 80% repolarization), calcium transient duration (30 or 80% reuptake), action potential and calcium transient alternans were constituted to validate the accuracy of software-generated maps. Manual and software maps had high accuracy, with >97% of manual and software values falling within 10 ms of each other and >75% within 5 ms for action potential duration and calcium transient duration measurements (n=1000-2000 pixels). Further, our software package includes additional cardiac metric measurement tools to analyze signal-to-noise ratio, conduction velocity, action potential and calcium transient alternans, and action potential-calcium transient coupling time to produce physiologically meaningful optical maps.\n\nConclusionsKairoSight-3.0 has enhanced capabilities to perform measurements of cardiac electrophysiology, calcium handling, and the excitation-contraction coupling with satisfactory accuracy.\n\nGraphical Abstract Demonstrating Experimental and Data Analysis WorkflowCreated with Biorender.com\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=148 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/538926v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (58K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@619850org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@156cd35org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ba772aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e57084_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Due to the anti-apoptotic impact of NF-{kappa}B it can affect cell fate decisions upon DNA damage and therefore interfere with tumour therapy-induced cell death. Here, we developed a dynamical model describing IKK/ NF-{kappa}B signalling that faithfully reproduces quantitative time course data and enabled a detailed analysis of pathway regulation. The approach elucidates a pathway topology with two hubs, where the first integrates signals from two DNA damage sensors and the second forms a coherent feedforward loop. The analyses reveal a critical role of the sensor protein PARP-1 in the pathway regulation. Introducing a method for calculating the impact of individual components on pathway activity in a time-resolved manner we show how irradiation dose influences pathway activation.

    "abstract": "Spheroids formation during epithelial ovarian cancer progression correlates with peritoneal organ colonization, disease recurrence, and poor prognosis. Although cancer progression has been demonstrated to be associated with and driven by metabolic changes within transformed cells, possible associations between metabolic dynamics and metastatic morphological transitions remain unexplored. To address this problem, we performed quantitative proteomics to identify protein signatures associated with three distinct morphologies (2D monolayers and two geometrically individual three-dimensional spheroidal states) of the high-grade serous ovarian cancer line OVCAR-3. Integrating the protein states onto genome-scale metabolic models allowed us to construct context-specific metabolic models for each morphological stage of the OVCAR-3 cell line and systematically evaluate their metabolic functionalities. We obtained disease-driving metabolic reaction modules using these models and elucidated gene knockout strategies to reduce metabolic alterations associated with disease progression. We explored the DrugBank database to mine pharmacological agents and evaluated the effect of drugs in impairing cancer progression. Finally, we experimentally validated our predictions by confirming the ability of one of our predicted drugs: the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir, to disrupt the metastatic spheroidal morphologies without any cytotoxic effect on untransformed stromal mesothelial monolayers.",

    "abstract": "P. falciparum parasites manipulate host metabolic processes during malaria to ensure their survival and progression, causing the host and parasite metabolic pathways to become intertwined. We analyzed metabolites to evaluate their potential as biomarkers for cerebral malaria (CM). Our analysis of CM (with coma) and CM-like (without coma) patients identified 835 metabolites, including lipids, amino acids, xenobiotics, peptides, nucleotides, carbohydrates, cofactors, and vitamins. Principal component analysis revealed clear segregation between CM-like and CM patients. Metabolite-by-metabolite analysis identified 103 differentially abundant metabolites, 26 of which were significantly lower in CM-like patients (primarily lipids), while 71% of those higher in CM patients were amino acids and xenobiotics. The results revealed significant differences in circulating levels of long chain free fatty acids and catecholamine metabolism and identified steroid biosynthesis as the most enriched lipid metabolism pathway, with eight endogenous steroids showing significantly higher levels in CM patients compared to CM-like patients (FC > 2, B-H FDR-adjusted P < 0.05). These steroids include pregnenolone sulfate, pregnenediol sulfate, pregnenetriol sulfate, androsterone monosulfate, 16-OH-DHEA-S, DHEA-S, cortisol, and cortisone. High levels of pregnenolone and its downstream metabolic derivatives were significantly associated with coma in CM patients. Our findings suggest that monitoring circulating neurosteroid levels in patients could aid in the early identification of those at risk of coma, and may important implications for the clinical management of CM patients.",

    "abstract": "Summary/AbstractYarrowia lipolytica naturally saves carbon excess as storage lipids. Engineering efforts allow redirecting the high precursor flux required for lipid synthesis towards added-value chemicals such as polyketides, flavonoids, and terpenoids. To redirect precursor flux from storage lipids to other products, four genes involved in triacylglycerol and sterol ester synthesis (DGA1, DGA2, LRO1, ARE1) can be deleted. To elucidate the effect of the deletions on cell physiology and regulation, we performed chemostat cultivations under carbon and nitrogen limitation, followed by transcriptome analysis. We found that storage lipid-free cells show an enrichment of the unfolded protein response, and several biological processes related to protein refolding and degradation are enriched. Additionally, storage lipid-free cells show an altered lipid class distribution with an abundance of potentially cytotoxic free fatty acids under nitrogen limitation. Our findings not only highlight the importance of lipid metabolism on cell physiology and proteostasis, but can also aid the development of improved chassy strains of Y. lipolytica for commodity chemical production.\n\nHighlightsO_LIPhysiological and transcriptomic characterization of storage lipid free (Q4) strain\nC_LIO_LIStorage lipid free strain shows an increased free fatty acid fraction on nitrogen limitation\nC_LIO_LIStorage lipid free strain is more sensitive towards fatty acid supplementation\nC_LIO_LIUnfolded protein response, chaperones, and ubiquitin are enriched in the storage lipid free strain\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Noradrenaline (norepinephrine) is known to modulate many physiological functions and behaviors. In this study, we tested to what extent astrocytes, a type of glial cell, participate in noradrenergic signaling in mouse primary visual cortex (V1). Astrocytes are essential partners of neurons in the central nervous system. They are central to brain homeostasis, but also dynamically regulate neuronal activity, notably by relaying and regulating neuromodulator signaling. Indeed, astrocytes express receptors for multiple neuromodulators, including noradrenaline, but the extent to which astrocytes are involved in noradrenergic signaling remains unclear. To test whether astrocytes are involved in noradrenergic neuromodulation in mice, we knocked down the major noradrenaline receptor in astrocytes, the 1A- adrenoreceptor. Using this model, we found that the 1A-adrenoreceptor is involved in triggering intracellular calcium transients in astrocytes, which are generally thought to underlie astrocyte function. To test if impaired 1A-adrenoreceptor signaling in astrocytes affected the function of neuronal circuits in V1, we used electrophysiological measurements and found that noradrenergic signaling through astrocyte 1A-adrenoreceptor controls the basal level of inhibition and regulates plasticity in V1 by potentiating synaptic responses in circuits involved in visual information processing.\n\nMAIN POINTSO_LIThe 1A-adrenoreceptor (1A-NAR) is the major 1-NAR in primary visual cortex (V1)\nC_LIO_LI1A-NAR signaling triggers astrocyte Ca2+ responses in V1.\nC_LIO_LIAstrocyte 1A-NARs play a key role in regulating basal inhibitory transmission and are crucial for LTP induction in V1\nC_LI",

Given the lack of reproducibility sometimes observed in mouse behavioral studies, we brought together a consortium of four laboratories to study the effects of arbaclofen on behavior in three different mouse lines with deletions in the mouse region syntenic to human 16p11.2 to test the robustness of these findings. Arbaclofen rescued cognitive deficits seen in two 16p11.2 deletion mouse lines in traditional recognition memory paradigms. Using an unsupervised machine-learning approach to analyze behavior, one lab found that arbaclofen also rescued differences in exploratory behavior in the open field in 16p11.2 deletion mice. Arbaclofen was not sedating and had modest off-target behavioral effects at the doses tested.

This capacity of  learning to learn, or meta-learning, is difficult to achieve in artificial systems, and the mechanisms by which it is achieved in animals are unknown. As a step toward enabling mechanistic studies, we developed a behavioral paradigm that demonstrates meta-learning in head-fixed mice. We trained mice to perform a two-alternative forced-choice task in virtual reality (VR), and successively changed the visual cues that signaled reward location. Mice showed increased learning speed in both cue generalization and serial reversal tasks. During reversal learning, behavior exhibited sharp transitions, with the transition occurring earlier in each successive reversal. Analysis of motor patterns revealed that animals utilized similar motor programs to execute the same actions in response to different cues but modified the motor programs during reversal learning. Our study demonstrates that mice can perform meta-learning tasks in VR, thus opening up opportunities for future mechanistic studies.",

    "abstract": "To ensure the sustainability of aquaculture, it is necessary to change the \"menu\" of carnivorous fish such as rainbow trout from a fish-based diet to one with plant-based ingredients. However, there is a major problem with the growth performance decrease of fish fed with a 100% plant-based diet due to the reduction in feed intake and feed efficiency. For the first time, we incorporated high levels of digestible carbohydrates (high-starch diet) in a 100% plant-based diet during a 12-week feeding trial in order to improve protein utilization for growth (protein sparing effect) and reduce nitrogen waste.\n\nWe measured the changes in the intestinal microbiota, Short-Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) levels and metabolic responses in liver. Dietary carbohydrates had a strong effect on alpha and beta diversity and abundance of 12 genera, including Ralstonia and Bacillus in digesta associated microbiota whereas mucosa associated microbiota was less affected. The change in microbial diversity might be linked to the change observed in SCFA production. High levels of Mycoplasma were observed in the intestinal mucosa. Overall, hepatic gene expression was significantly altered by the CHO/protein ratio. Up-regulation of genes involved in glucose metabolism (gcka, gckb, g6pcb2a), down-regulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism (hadh, acox3, srebp2a, and cyp51a) were associated with higher enzymatic activities (such as glucokinase or pyruvate kinase) and higher glycogen levels in the liver, suggesting adequate adaptation to diet. Interestingly, strong correlations were observed between abundances of certain bacterial OTUs and gene expression in the liver.\n\nThe inclusion of digestible carbohydrates in combination with a 100% plant-based diet, could be a promising way to improve and reduce the use of plant proteins in rainbow trout. In addition, the relationship between intestinal microbiota and host metabolism needs further investigation to better understand fish nutrition.",

Hindlimb ischemia mice were used as in vivo angiogenesis model. Protein and phospho-kinase arrays were used to determine underlying mechanisms.\n\nRESULTSPanx1 was the predominant pannexin isoform in human ECFCs and up-regulated in both replication-induced senescent ECFCs and circulating EPCs from aged mice and humans. Cellular activities of the young ECFCs were enhanced by Panx1 down-regulation, but attenuated by its up-regulation. In addition, reduction of Panx1 in the senescent ECFCs could rejuvenate cellular activities with reduced senescence-associated indicators, including senescence-associated {beta}-galactosidase activity, p16INK4a, p21, acetyl-p53, and phospho-Histone H2A.X. In mouse ischemic hindlimbs injected senescent ECFCs, blood perfusion ratio, salvaged limb outcome, and capillary density were all improved by Panx1 knockdown. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) was significantly increased in the supernatant from senescent ECFCs after Panx1 knockdown. The enhanced activities and paracrine effects of Panx1 knockdown senescent ECFCs were completely inhibited by anti-IGF-1 antibodies. FAK, ERK and STAT3 were activated in senescent ECFCs with Panx1 knockdown, in which the intracellular calcium level was reduced, and the activation was inhibited by supplemented calcium. The increased IGF-1 in Panx1-knockdown ECFCs was abrogated respectively by inhibitors of FAK (PF562271), ERK (U0126), and STAT3 (NSC74859), and supplemented calcium.\n\nCONCLUSIONSPanx1 expression is up-regulated in human ECFCs/EPCs with replication-induced senescence and during aging. Angiogenic potential of senescent ECFCs is improved by Panx1 reduction through increased IGF-1 production via activation of FAK-ERK axis following calcium influx reduction.

    "abstract": "Striatal dopamine is important to paranoid attributions, although its computational role in social inference remains elusive. We employed a simple game theoretic paradigm and computational model of intentional attributions to investigate the effects of dopamine D2/D3 antagonism on ongoing mental state inference following social outcomes. Haloperidol, compared to placebo, enhanced the impact of partner behaviour on beliefs about harmful intent, and increased learning from recent encounters. These alterations caused significant changes to model covariation and negative correlations between self-interest and harmful intent attributions. Our findings suggest haloperidol improves flexibility in model-based beliefs about others and simultaneously reduces the self-relevance of social observations. Our results may reflect the role of D2/D3 dopamine in supporting self-relevant mentalisation. Our data and model bridge theory between general and social accounts of value representation. We demonstrate initial evidence for the sensitivity of our model and short social paradigm to drug intervention and clinical dimensions, allowing distinctions between mechanisms that operate across traits and states.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=152 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/539031v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c7a54dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@135899corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dd854aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@59c35b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Extremophiles, such as the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus, thrive under extreme conditions and must rapidly adapt to changes in the physical parameters of their natural environment for short-term and long-term survival. When inhabiting hydrothermal vents, these organisms face substantial temperature gradients, necessitating the evolution of adaptive thermal stress mechanisms. However, the dynamics and coordination of cellular responses at the transcriptome and proteome levels remain underexplored. This study presents an integrated analysis of RNA-sequencing and mass spectrometry data to elucidate the transcriptomic and proteomic responses to heat and cold shock stress and recovery in P. furiosus. Our results reveal surprisingly rapid and dynamic changes in gene and protein expression patterns associated with these stress responses. Heat shock triggers extensive transcriptome reprogramming, orchestrated by the transcriptional regulator Phr, which targets a broader gene repertoire than previously demonstrated. For heat shock signature genes, RNA levels swiftly return to baseline upon recovery, while protein levels remain persistently upregulated, reflecting a rapid but more sustained response. Intriguingly, cold shock at 4{degrees}C elicits distinct short-term and long-term responses at both RNA and protein levels. By conducting a cluster analysis, we identified gene sets with either congruent or contrasting trends in RNA and protein changes. Notably, these clusters represent well-separated arCOG groups and appear to be tailored to their individual cellular responses. Our study provides a comprehensive overview of the cellular response to temperature stress, advancing our understanding of stress response mechanisms in hyperthermophilic archaea and provide valuable insights into the molecular adaptations that facilitate life in extreme environments.",

A distinguishing feature of retroviruses is reverse transcription, where the ssRNA genome serves as a template to synthesize a double-stranded DNA copy that subsequently integrates into the host genome. As retroviral RNAs are produced by the host transcriptional machinery and are largely indistinguishable from cellular mRNAs, we investigated the potential of incoming retroviral genomes to express proteins. Here we show through various biochemical methods that HIV-1 genomes are translated after entry, in case of minimal or full-length genomes, envelopes using different cellular entry pathways and in diverse cell types. Our findings challenge the dogma that retroviruses require reverse transcription to produce viral proteins. Synthesis of retroviral proteins in the absence of productive infection has significant implications for basic retrovirology, immune responses and gene therapy applications.",

    "abstract": "DNA combing and DNA spreading are two central approaches for studying DNA replication fork dynamics genome-wide at single-molecule resolution by distributing labeled genomic DNA on coverslips or slides for immunodetection. Perturbations in DNA replication fork dynamics can differentially affect either leading or lagging strand synthesis, for example in instances where replication is blocked by a lesion or obstacle on only one of the two strands. Thus, we sought to investigate whether the DNA combing and/or spreading approaches are suitable for resolving adjacent sister chromatids during DNA replication, thereby enabling the detection of DNA replication dynamics within individual nascent strands. To this end, we developed a thymidine labeling scheme that discriminates between these two possibilities. Our data suggests that DNA combing resolves single chromatids, allowing the detection of strand-specific alterations, whereas DNA spreading does not. These findings have important implications when interpreting DNA replication dynamics from data obtained by these two commonly used techniques.",

One such cytokine is IL-6, which has been deemed a key cachectic factor in mice inoculated with the colon carcinoma 26 (C26) cells, one of the most widely used models of cancer cachexia. Here to test the causal role of IL-6 in cancer cachexia, we used CRISPR/Cas9 editing to knock out IL-6 in C26 cells. We found that growth of IL-6 KO C26 tumors was dramatically delayed. Most strikingly, while IL-6 KO tumors eventually reached the similar size as wild-type tumors, cachexia still took place, despite no elevation in circulating IL-6. We further showed an increase of immune cell populations in IL-6 KO tumors and the defective IL-6 KO tumor growth was rescued in immunodeficient mice. Thus, our results invalidated IL-6 as a necessary factor for causing cachexia in the C26 model and revealed instead its important role in regulating tumor growth via immune suppression.",

    "abstract": "Kinesins support many diverse cellular processes, including facilitating cell division through mechanical regulation of the mitotic spindle. However, how kinesin activity is controlled to facilitate this process is not well understood. Interestingly, post-translational modifications have been identified within the enzymatic region of all 45 mammalian kinesins, but the significance of these modifications has gone largely unexplored. Given the critical role of the enzymatic region in facilitating nucleotide and microtubule binding, it may serve as a primary site for kinesin regulation. Consistent with this idea, a phosphomimetic mutation at S357 in the neck- linker of KIF18A alters the localization of KIF18A within the spindle from kinetochore microtubules to peripheral microtubules. Changes in localization of KIF18A-S357D are accompanied by defects in mitotic spindle positioning and the ability to promote mitotic progression. This altered localization pattern is mimicked by a shortened neck-linker mutant, suggesting that KIF18A-S357D may cause the motor to adopt a shortened neck-linker like state that prevents KIF18A from accumulating at the plus-ends of kinetochore microtubules. These findings demonstrate that post-translational modifications in the enzymatic region of kinesins could be important for biasing their localization to particular microtubule subpopulations.",

    "abstract": "The expression of information encoded in genomes is not error-free. Transcript-error rates are dramatically higher than DNA-level mutation rates, and despite their transient nature, the steady-state load of such errors imposes a burden on cellular performance. However, a broad perspective on the degree to which transcript-error rates are constrained by natural selection and diverge among lineages remains to be developed. Here, we present a genome-wide analysis of transcript-error rates across the Tree of Life, showing that the effects of such errors are most likely at least partially dominant, and possibly synergistic, such that larger cells with more transcripts experience larger error burdens. Despite having a much narrower phylogenetic range of variation than genomic mutation rates, transcript-error rates vary in a manner that is consistent with the drift-barrier hypothesis, previously postulated as an explanatory framework for genome mutation-rate evolution. Thus, the degree to which natural selection is capable of reducing transcript-error rates is a function of both the population-genetic and the cellular environment (effective population size, cell volume, proteome size, and average fitness effects of individual errors). The idea that transcript-error rates are adaptively reduced in genes with high expression finds little support in the data.",

While the biosynthesis of MA is well studied, the mechanisms governing its transport from the inner membrane to the OM remain largely elusive. In this study, we characterized the function of MSMEG_0317 in Mycobacterium smegmatis, a membrane protein encoded within a conserved genetic locus that has been implicated in MA metabolism and/or transport. Using a conditional knockout mutant, we demonstrate that msmeg_0317 is essential for mycobacterial growth. Depleting msmeg_0317 from cells blocks the formation of MA species found at the OM, establishing a critical function in MA transport across the cell envelope. We further reveal that MSMEG_0317 exists as stable dimers in vitro that require the presence of its N- and C-terminal transmembrane helices, both of which are important for functionality in cells. Our work defines the essential role of MSMEG_0317 in MA metabolism and/or transport, and offers new insights into cell envelope biogenesis in mycobacteria.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised segmentation in biological and non-biological images is only partially resolved. Segmentation either requires arbitrary thresholds or large teaching datasets. Here we propose a spatial autocorrelation method based on Local Morans I coefficient to differentiate signal, background and noise in any type of image. The method, originally described for geoinformatics, does not require a predefined intensity threshold or teaching algorithm for image segmentation and allows quantitative comparison of samples obtained in different conditions. It utilizes relative intensity as well as spatial information of neighboring elements to select spatially contiguous groups of pixels. We demonstrate that Morans method outperforms threshold-based method (TBM) in both artificially generated as well as in natural images especially when background noise is substantial. This superior performance can be attributed to the exclusion of false positive pixels resulting from isolated, high intensity pixels in high noise conditions. To test the methods power in real situation we used high power confocal images of the somatosensory thalamus immunostained for Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 (A-type) voltage gated potassium channels. Morans method identified high intensity Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 ion channel clusters in the thalamic neuropil. Spatial distribution of these clusters displayed strong correlation with large sensory axon terminals of subcortical origin. The unique association of the special presynaptic terminals and a postsynaptic voltage gated ion channel cluster was confirmed with electron microscopy. These data demonstrate that Morans method is a rapid, simple image segmentation method optimal for variable and high nose conditions.\n\nSignificance statementMost images of natural objects are noisy, especially when captured at the resolution limit of the optical devices. The simplest way of differentiating between pixels of objects and noise is to examine the neighboring pixels. Statistical evaluation of local spatial correlation highlights assemblies of non-random bright pixels representing tiny biological entities, e.g. potassium channel clusters. Local Morans I allows detecting borders of fuzzy objects therefore it can be a basis of a user independent image segmentation method. This straightforward method outperforms threshold based segmentation methods and does not require a tedious training of artificial intelligence. The method could identify a previously unknown association of specialized presynaptic terminal type with postsynaptic ion channel clusters.",

To systematically evaluate this regulatory mechanism, we developed an extended eQTL mapping method named DNA methylation modulated eQTL (memo-eQTL). We performed memo-eQTL mapping in 128 normal prostate samples and discovered 1,731 memo-eQTLs, a vast majority of which have not been reported as eQTLs. We found that the methylation of the memo-eQTL CpG sites can either enhance or insulate the interaction between SNP and Gene expression by altering CTCF-based chromatin 3D structure. This study demonstrated the prevalence of memo-eQTLs, which can enable the identification of novel causal genes for traits or diseases associated with genetic variations.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe bHLH transcription factor family is named after the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain that is a characteristic element of their members. Understanding the function and characteristics of this family is important for the examination of a wide range of functions. As the availability of genome sequences and transcriptome assemblies has increased significantly, the need for automated solutions that provide reliable functional annotations is emphasised.\n\nResultsA phylogenetic approach was adapted for the automatic identification and functional annotation of the bHLH transcription factor family. The bHLH_annotator for the automated functional annotation of bHLHs was implemented in Python3. Sequences of bHLHs described in literature were collected to represent the full diversity of bHLH sequences.\n\nPreviously described orthologs form the basis for the functional annotation assignment to candidates which are also screened for bHLH-specific motifs. The pipeline was successfully deployed on the two Arabidopsis thaliana accessions Col-0 and Nd-1, the monocot species Dioscorea dumetorum, and a transcriptome assembly of Croton tiglium.\n\nDepending on the applied search parameters for the initial candidates in the pipeline, species-specific candidates or members of the bHLH family which experienced domain loss can be identified.\n\nConclusionsThe bHLH_annotator allows a detailed and systematic investigation of the bHLH family in land plant species and classifies candidates based on bHLH-specific characteristics, which distinguishes the pipeline from other established functional annotation tools. This provides the basis for the functional annotation of the bHLH family in land plants and the systematic examination of a wide range of functions regulated by this transcription factor family.",

Analysis of the young and aged secretome from human dermal fibroblasts identified >5-fold levels of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) in the aged fibroblast secretome. IGFBP2 functionally triggers upregulation of the PI3K-dependent fatty acid biosynthesis program in melanoma cells through increases in FASN. Melanoma cells co-cultured with aged dermal fibroblasts have higher levels of lipids relative to young dermal fibroblasts, which can be lowered by silencing IGFBP2 expression in fibroblasts, prior to treating with conditioned media. Conversely, ectopically treating melanoma cells with recombinant IGFBP2 in the presence of conditioned media from young fibroblasts, promoted lipid synthesis and accumulation in the melanoma cells. Neutralizing IGFBP2 in vitro reduces migration and invasion in melanoma cells, and in vivo studies demonstrate that neutralizing IGFBP2 in syngeneic aged mice, ablates tumor growth as well as metastasis. Conversely, ectopic treatment of young mice with IGFBP2 in young mice increases tumor growth and metastasis. Our data reveal that aged dermal fibroblasts increase melanoma cell aggressiveness through increased secretion of IGFBP2, stressing the importance of considering age when designing studies and treatment.\n\nSignificanceThe aged microenvironment drives metastasis in melanoma cells.

    "abstract": "This brief paper documents a simple and efficient method to generate auditory-nerve spike trains for the purpose of simulating neural processes of auditory perception. In response to sound, each auditory nerve fiber carries information to the auditory brainstem in the form of a train of spikes (action potentials), the timing and rate of which reflect the sound. The generation process is usually approximated as Poisson process with a time-varying rate, further modified by refractory effects. The purpose, here, is to simulate spike generation as a time- and interval-dependent thinning process applied to a homogenous Poisson process, allowing for fast generation, cheap storage, and unlimited temporal resolution.",

    "abstract": "Puromycin is covalently added to the nascent chain of proteins by the peptidyl transferase activity of the ribosome and this event is normally followed by the dissociation of the puromycylated peptide. It was postulated that blocking the translocation of the ribosome with emetine could trap the puromycylated peptide on the ribosome, but evidence against this has recently been published (Hobson et al., 2020 https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.60048; Enam et al., 2020 https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.60303). In neurons, puromycylated nascent chains appear to remain in the ribosome even in the absence of emetine, yet direct evidence for this had been lacking. Using biochemistry and cryo-electron microscopy, we show that the puromycylated peptides remain in the ribosome exit channel in the large subunit in a subset of neuronal ribosomes stalled in the hybrid state. These results validate previous experiments to localize stalled polysomes in neurons and provide insight into how neuronal ribosomes are stalled. Moreover, in these hybrid-state ribosomes, anisomycin, which normally blocks puromycylation, competes poorly with puromycin in the puromycylation reaction, allowing a simple assay to determine the proportion of nascent chains in neurons stalled in this state. In early hippocampal neuronal cultures, over 50% of all nascent peptides are found in these stalled polysomes. These results provide new insights into the stalling mechanisms of neuronal ribosomes and suggest that puromycylated peptides can be used to reveal subcellular sites of hybrid-state stalled ribosomes in neurons.\n\nSignificance StatementPuromycin can be covalently linked to the nascent polypeptide chain on ribosomes, followed by dissociation of the puromycylated polypeptide. Here we conclusively show that in stalled polysomes isolated from neuronal RNA granules, the puromycylated peptide instead remains in the polypeptide exit tunnel of the ribosome. This validates previous data using this technique to localize stalled polysomes in neurons and suggests a unique ribosomal conformation in these cells. Further evidence for the unique state of these ribosomes is the resistance of puromycylation to the inhibitor anisomycin, which prevents puromycylation in all other cellular contexts. These results provide insight into mechanism underlying neuronal ribosome stalling and resolve a controversy about the use of puromycin to localize translation in neurons.",

However, immune imprinting induced by wildtype (WT)-based vaccination would compromise the antibody response to Omicron-based boosters5-9. Vaccination strategies that can counter immune imprinting are critically needed. In this study, we investigated the degree and dynamics of immune imprinting in mouse models and human cohorts, especially focusing on the role of repeated Omicron stimulation. Our results show that in mice, the efficacy of single Omicron-boosting is heavily limited by immune imprinting, especially when using variants antigenically distinct from WT, like XBB, while the concerning situation could be largely mitigated by a second Omicron booster. Similarly, in humans, we found that repeated Omicron infections could also alleviate WT-vaccination-induced immune imprinting and generate high neutralizing titers against XBB.1.5 and XBB.1.16 in both plasma and nasal mucosa. By isolating 781 RBD-targeting mAbs from repeated Omicron infection cohorts, we revealed that double Omicron exposure alleviates immune imprinting by generating a large proportion of highly matured and potent Omicron-specific antibodies. Importantly, epitope characterization using deep mutational scanning (DMS) showed that these Omicron-specific antibodies target distinct RBD epitopes compared to WT-induced antibodies, and the bias towards non-neutralizing epitopes observed in single Omicron exposures due to imprinting was largely restored after repeated Omicron stimulation, together leading to a substantial neutralizing epitope shift. Based on the DMS profiles, we identified evolution hotspots of XBB.1.5 RBD and demonstrated the combinations of these mutations could further boost XBB.1.5s immune-evasion capability while maintaining high ACE2 binding affinity. Our findings suggest the WT component should be abandoned when updating COVID-19 vaccine antigen compositions to XBB lineages, and those who havent been exposed to Omicron yet should receive two updated vaccine boosters.",

    "abstract": "Biofilm formation begins when bacteria contacting a surface induce cellular changes to become better adapted for surface growth. One of the first changes to occur for Pseudomonas aeruginosa after surface contact is an increase in the nucleotide second messenger 3,5-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). It has been demonstrated that this increase in intracellular cAMP is dependent on functional Type IV pili (T4P) relaying a signal to the Pil-Chp system, but the mechanism by which this signal is transduced remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the role of the Type IV pili retraction motor PilT in sensing a surface and relaying that signal to cAMP production. We show that mutations affecting the structure of PilT and in particular ATPase activity of this motor protein, reduce surface-dependent cAMP production. We identify a novel interaction between PilT and PilJ, a member of the Pil-Chp system, and propose a new model whereby P. aeruginosa uses its retraction motor to sense a surface and to relay that signal via PilJ to increased production of cAMP. We discuss these findings in light of current TFP-dependent surface sensing models for P. aeruginosa.\n\nImportanceT4P are cellular appendages that allow P. aeruginosa to sense a surface leading to the production of cAMP. This second messenger not only activates virulence pathways but leads to further surface adaptation and irreversible attachment of cells. Here, we demonstrate the importance of the retraction motor PilT in surface sensing. We also present a new surface sensing model in P. aeruginosa whereby the T4P retraction motor PilT senses and transmits the surface signal, likely via its ATPase domain and interaction with PilJ, to mediate production of the second messenger cAMP.",

Among the intercellular transmission routes described, HTLV-1 biofilms are adhesive structures polarized at the cell surface that confine virions in a protective environment, which is believed to promote their simultaneous delivery during infection. Here, we show that several tetraspanins are enriched in HTLV-1 biofilms and incorporated into the viral envelope. However, we report that only tetraspanin CD82 interacts with HTLV-1 Gag which initiates its polarization into viral biofilms. Also, we demonstrate that CD82 maintains HTLV-1 biofilm polarization and favors viral transmission, as its silencing induces a complete reorganization of viral clusters at the cell surface and reduces the ability of infected T-cells to transmit the virus. Our results highlight the crucial role of CD82 in the architectural organization of HTLV-1 biofilms and their transfer through intercellular contacts.",

Furthermore, it is much easier to ask and answer what mRNAs a specific protein might bind to than the other way around. Here, we implemented an RNA-centric proximity labeling technology at different points in the cell cycle in highly synchronous yeast cultures. To understand how the translation of FAS1, encoding fatty acid synthase, peaks late in the cell cycle, we identified proteins that bind the FAS1 transcript in a cell cycle-dependent manner. We used dCas13d-APEX2 fusions to target FAS1 and label nearby proteins, which were then identified by mass spectrometry. The glycolytic enzyme Tdh3p, a known RNA-binding protein, bound the FAS1 mRNA, and it was necessary for the increased Fas1p expression late in the cell cycle. Lastly, cells lacking Tdh3p had altered size homeostasis, consistent with delayed G1/S transition and exit from mitosis. These results point to unexpected connections between major metabolic pathways. They also underscore the role of mRNA-protein interactions for gene expression during cell division.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers Disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by the accumulation of abeta-amyloid aggregates, which triggers tau hyperphosphorylation and neuronal loss. While the precise mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in AD are not entirely understood, it is known that loss of proteostasis is implicated in this process. Maintaining neuronal proteostasis requires proper transfer RNA (tRNA) modifications, which are crucial for optimal translation. However, research into tRNA epitranscriptome in AD is limited, and it is not yet clear how alterations in tRNA modifying enzymes and tRNA modifications might contribute to disease progression. Here, we report that expression of the tRNA modifying enzyme ELP3 is reduced in the brain of AD patients and amyloid AD mouse models, suggesting ELP3 is implicated in proteostasis dysregulation observed in AD. To investigate the role of ELP3 specifically in neuronal proteostasis impairments in the context of amyloid pathology, we analyzed SH-SY5Y neuronal cells carrying the amyloidogenic Swedish familial AD mutation in the APP gene (SH-SWE) or the wild-type gene (SH-WT). Similarly to the amyloid mouse models, SH-SWE exhibited reduced levels of ELP3 which was associated with tRNA hypomodifications and reduced abundance, as well as proteostasis impairments. Furthermore, the knock-down of ELP3 in SH-WT recapitulated the proteostasis impairments observed in SH-SWE cells. Importantly, the correction of tRNA deficits due to ELP3 reduction rescued and reverted proteostasis impairments of SH-SWE and SH-WT knock-down for ELP3, respectively. Additionally, SH-WT exposed to the secretome of SH-SWE or synthetic amyloid aggregates recapitulate the SH-SWE phenotype, characterized by reduced ELP3 expression, tRNA hypomodification and increased protein aggregation. Taken together, our data suggest that amyloid pathology dysregulates neuronal proteostasis through the reduction of ELP3 and tRNA modifications. This study highlights the modulation of tRNA modifications as a potential therapeutic avenue to restore neuronal proteostasis in AD and preserve neuronal function.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=112 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/538928v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (44K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ed5cf4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@171b14aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12eb19dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8ed4ab_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Muscle regeneration therefore requires not only reestablishment of myofibers, but restoration of tissue architecture. Resident muscle stem cells (SCs) are essential for regeneration, but how SCs regenerate muscle architecture is largely unknown. We address this problem using genetic labeling of SCs and whole mount imaging to reconstruct in three dimensions muscle regeneration. Unexpectedly, we found that the residual basement membrane of necrotic myofibers is critical for promoting fusion and orienting regenerated myofibers and myofibers form via two distinct phases of fusion. Furthermore, the centralized myonuclei characteristic of regenerated myofibers are associated with myofibrillogenesis and permanently mark regenerated myofibers. Finally, we elucidate a new cellular mechanism for the formation of branched myofibers, a pathology characteristic of diseased muscle. We provide a new synthesis of the cellular events of regeneration and show these differ from those used during development.",

    "abstract": "During morphogenesis tissue-scale forces drive large-scale deformations, yet how these forces arise from the local interplay between cellular contractility and adhesion is poorly understood. In the posterior endoderm of Drosophila embryos, a self-organized tissue-scale wave of actomyosin contractility and cell invagination is coupled with adhesion to the surrounding vitelline membrane to drive the polarized tissue deformation. We report here that this process emerges at the subcellular level from the mechanical coupling between Myosin-II activation and sequential adhesion/de-adhesion to the vitelline membrane. At the wavefront, integrin focal complexes anchor the actin cortex to the vitelline membrane and promote activation of Myosin-II, which in turn enhances adhesion in a positive feedback loop. Subsequently, upon detachment, cortex contraction and advective flow further amplify Myosin-II levels. Prolonged contact with the vitelline membrane increases the duration of the integrin-Myosin-II feedback, integrin adhesion and thus slows down cell detachment and wave propagation of the invagination. Finally, we show that the angle of cell detachment changes as a function of the strength of adhesion and modifies the tensile forces required for detachment to maintain wave propagation. This illustrates how the tissue-scale wave arises from subcellular mechanochemical feedbacks and tissue geometry.",

Here we report a new function of Tet in regulating Drosophila early brain development. We found that mutation in the Tet DNA-binding domain (TetAXXC) resulted in axon guidance defects in the mushroom body (MB). Tet is required in early brain development during the outgrowth of MB {beta} axons. Transcriptomic study shows that glutamine synthetase 2 (Gs2), a key enzyme in glutamatergic signaling, is significantly downregulated in the TetAXXC mutant brains. CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis or RNAi knockdown of Gs2 recapitulates the TetAXXC mutant phenotype. Surprisingly, Tet and Gs2 act in the insulin-producing cells (IPCs) to control MB axon guidance, and overexpression of Gs2 in these cells rescues the axon guidance defects of TetAXXC. Treating TetAXXC with the metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist MPEP can rescue while treating with glutamate enhances the phenotype confirming Tet function in regulating glutamatergic signaling. TetAXXC and the Drosophila homolog of Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein protein mutant (Fmr13) have similar axon guidance defects and reduction in Gs2 mRNA levels. Interestingly, overexpression of Gs2 in the IPCs also rescues the Fmr13 phenotype, suggesting functional overlapping of the two genes.

Despite the divergent evolution that characterizes the plastids of different lineages, many traits such as membrane organisation and means of fission are universal - they pay tribute to the cyanobacterial origin of the organelle. For one such trait, the peptidoglycan (PG) layer, the situation is more complicated, and little is known about its distribution and molecular relevance in green algae and land plants. Here, we investigate the extent of PG presence across the Chloroplastida using a phylogenomic approach. Our data support the view of a PG layer being present in the last common ancestor of land plants and its remarkable conservation across bryophytes that are otherwise characterized by gene loss. In embryophytes, the occurrence of the PG layer biosynthetic toolkit becomes patchier, but the availability of novel genome data questions previous predictions regarding a functional coevolution of the PG layer and the plastid division machinery-associated gene FtsZ3. Furthermore, our data confirm the presence of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) in seed plants, which were previously thought to be absent from this clade. The thicker and seemingly unchanged PG layer armouring the plastids of glaucophyte algae might still provide the original function of structural support, but the same can likely not be said about the only recently identified and ultrathin PG layer of bryophyte and tracheophyte plastids. In combination with the apparent lack of some genes thought critical for PG layer biosynthesis in land plants that, however, likely have a PG layer, this leaves many issues with respect to the composition, exact function, and biosynthesis in land plants to be explored.",

In this study, we enriched libraries for R genes using RenSeq from baits primarily developed from the common sunflower (Helianthus annuus) reference genome. We sequenced the R gene libraries of Silphium integrifolium Michx, a perennial relative of sunflower, from 12 prairie remnants across a rainfall gradient in the Central Plains of the United States, with both Illumina short-read (n=99) and PacBio long-read (n=10) approaches. We found a positive relationship between the mean effective annual precipitation of a plants source prairie remnant and the number of R genes in its genome, consistent with intensity of plant pathogen coevolution increasing with precipitation.

Characterisation of these host/nested gene pairs is required to understand their transcriptional crosstalk.

Host genes were more highly expressed and more likely to be protein-coding and their nested gene partners mainly reside within the largest intron of their host. Individual analysis of host or nested gene expression did not reveal tissue specific profiles. Co-expression profiles did reveal tissue specific profiles, suggesting host/nested gene crosstalk plays a role during differentiation and development. To assess true co-expression or mutual expression testis scRNA-seq data were used, revealing that pairs can switch expression dynamically between these states during spermatogenesis. Host genes have a larger pool of isoforms and when co-expression occurred at some testis-specific pairs, host transcript diversity increased. Scanning experimentally validated polyadenylation sites upstream of the nested gene, shows that host polyadenylation sites are enriched, implying that alternative polyadenylation is one of the mechanisms influenced by host/nested gene co-expression.

    "abstract": "The nine different membrane-anchored adenylyl cyclase isoforms (AC1-9) in mammals are stimulated by the heterotrimeric G protein Gs, but their response to G{beta}{gamma} regulation is isoform-specific. For example, AC5 is conditionally activated by G{beta}{gamma}. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of ligand-free AC5 in complex with G{beta}{gamma} and of a dimeric form of AC5 that could be involved in its regulation. G{beta}{gamma} binds to a coiled-coil domain that links the AC transmembrane region to its catalytic core as well as to a region (C1b) that is known to be a hub for isoform-specific regulation. We confirmed the G{beta}{gamma} interaction with both purified proteins and cell-based assays. The interface with G{beta}{gamma} involves AC5 residues that are subject to gain-of-function mutations in humans with familial dyskinesia, indicating that the observed interaction is important for motor function. A molecular mechanism wherein G{beta}{gamma} either prevents dimerization of AC5 or allosterically modulates the coiled-coil domain, and hence the catalytic core, is proposed. Because our mechanistic understanding of how individual AC isoforms are uniquely regulated is limited, studies such as this may provide new avenues for isoform-specific drug development.",

We have identified additional molecular markers for at least five distinct cell types in the papillae of the model tunicate Ciona, allowing us to further study the development of these organs. Using tissue-specific CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis and other molecular perturbations, we reveal the roles of key transcription factors and signaling pathways that are important for patterning the papilla territory into a highly organized array of different cell types and shapes. We further test the contributions of different transcription factors and cell types to the production of the adhesive glue that allows for larval attachment during settlement, and to the processes of tail retraction and body rotation during metamorphosis. With this study, we continue working towards connecting gene regulation to cellular functions that control the developmental transition between the motile larva and sessile adult of Ciona.",

In this study, we examine the morphological events leading to crypt formation, epithelial cell differentiation, areas of proliferation, and the emergence and expression of a stem and progenitor cell marker Lrig1. Through multicolor lineage tracing, we show Lrig1 expressing cells are present at birth and behave as stem cells to establish clonal crypts within three weeks after birth. In addition, we use an inducible knockout mouse to eliminate Lrig1 during colon development and show loss of Lrig1 restrains proliferation within a critical developmental time window, without impacting colonic epithelial cell differentiation.

A common mechanism of spatial synchrony is the Moran effect, whereby spatially synchronized environmental signals drive population dynamics and hence induce population synchrony. After reviewing recent progress in understanding Moran effects, we here elaborate a general theory of how Moran effects of different environmental drivers acting on the same populations can interact, either synergistically or destructively, to produce either substantially more or markedly less population synchrony than would otherwise occur. We provide intuition for how this newly recognized mechanism works through theoretical case studies and application of our theory to California populations of giant kelp. We argue that Moran interactions should be common. Our theory and analysis explain an important new aspect of a fundamental feature of spatiotemporal population dynamics.",

Herein we report a novel strategy to explore our hypothesis by synthesizing the deoxynucleoside phosphoramidite building block with the seleno-modification at 5-position of thymidine, as well as its Se-oligonucleotides. Via X-ray crystal structural study, we found that the Se-modification was located in the major groove of nucleic acid duplex and didnt cause the thermal and structural perturbations. Surprisingly, our nucleobase-modified Se-DNAs were exceptionally resistant to nuclease digestion, while compatible with RNase H activity. This affords a novel avenue for potential antisense modification in the form of Se-antisense oli-gonucleotides (Se-ASO).",

    "abstract": "In the last decade, Ultrafast Ultrasound Localisation Microscopy has taken non-invasive deep vascular imaging down to the microscopic level. By imaging diluted suspensions of circulating microbubbles in the blood stream at kHz framerate and localising the center of their individual point spread function with a sub-resolution precision, it enabled to break the unvanquished trade-off between depth of imaging and resolution by microscopically mapping the microbubbles flux and velocities deep into tissue. However, ULM also suffers limitations. Many small vessels are not visible in the ULM images due to the noise level in areas dimly explored by the microbubbles. Moreover, as the vast majority of studies are performed using 2D imaging, quantification is limited to in-plane velocity or flux measurements which hinders the accurate velocity determination and quantification. Here we show that the backscattering amplitude of each individual microbubble can also be exploited to produce backscattering images of the vascularization with a higher sensitivity compared to conventional ULM images. By providing valuable information about the relative distance of the microbubble to the 2D imaging plane in the out-of-plane direction, backscattering ULM images introduces a physically relevant 3D rendering perception in the vascular maps. It also retrieves the missing information about the out-of-plane motion of microbubbles and provides a way to improve 3D flow and velocity quantification using 2D ULM. These results pave the way to improved visualization and quantification for 2D and 3D ULM.",

With a focus on files produced by the Gromacs MD software, we illustrate the potential offered by the mining of publicly available MD data.

Based on this analysis, we inferred metadata to propose a search engine prototype to explore collected MD data.

    "abstract": "Predicting the impact of new emerging virus mutations is of major interest in surveillance and for understanding the evolutionary forces of the pathogen. The SARS-CoV-2 surface spike-protein (S-protein) binds to human ACE2 receptors as a critical step in host cell infection. At the same time, S-protein binding to human antibodies neutralizes the virus and prevents interaction with ACE2. Here we combine these two binding properties in a simple virus fitness model, using structure-based computation of all possible mutation effects averaged over 10 ACE2 complexes and 10 antibody complexes of the S-protein ([~]3,80,000 computed mutations), and validated the approach against diverse experimental binding/escape data of ACE2 and antibodies. The ACE2-antibody selectivity change caused by mutation (i.e., the differential change in binding to ACE2 vs. immunity-inducing antibodies) is proposed to be a key metric of fitness model, enabling systematic error cancelation when evaluated. In this model, new mutations become fixated if they increase the selective binding to ACE2 relative to circulating antibodies, assuming that both are present in the host in a competitive binding situation. We use this model to categorize viral mutations that may best reach ACE2 before being captured by antibodies. Our model may aid the understanding of variant-specific vaccines and molecular mechanisms of viral evolution in the context of a human host.",

To build turst in these predictors, it is crucial to understand the rationale behind their decisions with human-interpretable explanations. We present MHCXAI, eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques to help interpret the outputs from MHC class I predictors in terms of input peptide features. In our experiments, we explain the outputs of four state-of-the-art MHC class I predictors over a large dataset of peptides and MHC alleles. Additionally, we evaluate the reliability of the explanations by comparing against ground truth and checking their robustness.

    "abstract": "Coronavirus infections, such as the global COVID-19 pandemic, have had a profound impact on many aspects of our daily life including working style, economy, and the healthcare system. To prevent the rapid viral transmission and speed up recovery from the infection, many academic organizations and industry research labs have conducted extensive research on discovering new therapeutic options for SARS-CoV-2. Among those efforts, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitors such as Remdesivir, Molnupiravir and 3CLpro inhibitor such as Nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) have been widely used as the therapeutic options. Given the recent emergence of several new variants that caused a resurgence of the virus, it would be beneficial to discover more diverse therapeutic options with novel anti-viral mechanisms. In this regard, PLpro has been highlighted since it, along with 3CLpro, is one of the two most important proteases that are required for SARS-CoV-2 viral processing. While 3CLpro inhibitors were extensively investigated in the light of Emergency Use Authorizations of Nirmatrelvir, PLpro inhibitors have not been thoroughly investigated even preclinically. Thus, discovery efforts on antivirals acting against PLpro will be valuable. PLpro inhibitors may exert their activity by inhibiting viral replication and enhancing the host defense system through blocking virus-induced cell signaling events for evading host immune response. In this study, we report the discovery and development of two covalent irreversible PLpro inhibitors, HUP0109 and its deuterated analog DX-027, out of our quest for novel anti-COVID 19 therapeutic agents for the past two and half years. HUP0109 selectively targets the viral catalytic cleft of PLpro and covalently modifies its active site cysteine residue (C111). Promising results from preclinical evaluation suggest that DX-027 can be developed as a potential COVID-19 treatment.",

Existing raw EEG explainability methods identify relative feature importance but do not identify how features relate to model predictions. In this study, we combine well-characterized first layer filters with a novel post hoc statistical analysis of the filter activations that linearly relates properties of model activations and predictions. We implement our approach within the context of automated sleep stage classification, finding that the model uncovers positive relationships between waveforms resembling sleep spindles and NREM2, between high frequency filters and Awake samples, and between {delta} activity and NREM3.

Immunization compared to infection enriches IgG1-mediated antibody functions with changes in antibody post-translational sialylation and fucosylation that impact fetal more than maternal antibody functional potency. Thus, vaccine enhanced antibody functional magnitude, potency and breadth in the fetus are driven more by antibody glycosylation and Fc effector functions compared to maternal responses, highlighting prenatal opportunities to safeguard newborns as SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic.\n\nOne Sentence SummarySARS-CoV-2 vaccination in pregnancy induces diverging maternal and infant cord antibody functions",

    "abstract": "Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a rapidly increasing threat to human health. New strategies to combat resistant organisms are desperately needed. One potential avenue is targeting two-component systems, which are the main bacterial signal transduction pathways used to regulate development, metabolism, virulence, and antibiotic resistance. These systems consist of a homodimeric membrane-bound sensor histidine kinase, and a cognate effector, the response regulator. The high sequence conservation in the catalytic and adenosine triphosphate-binding (CA) domain of histidine kinases and their essential role in bacterial signal transduction could enable broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. Through this signal transduction, histidine kinases regulate multiple virulence mechanisms including toxin production, immune evasion, and antibiotic resistance. Targeting virulence, as opposed to development of bactericidal compounds, could reduce evolutionary pressure for acquired resistance. Additionally, compounds targeting the CA domain have the potential to impair multiple two-component systems that regulate virulence in one or more pathogens. We conducted structure-activity relationship studies of 2-aminobenzothiazole-based inhibitors designed to target the CA domain of histidine kinases. We found these compounds have anti-virulence activities in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, reducing motility phenotypes and toxin production associated with the pathogenic functions of this bacterium.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=158 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/539119v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17351adorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f73599org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dfed8aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16409ba_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The healthy human infant gut microbiome undergoes stereotypical changes in taxonomic composition between birth and maturation to an adult-like stable state. During this time, extensive communication between microbiota and the host immune system contributes to health status later in life. Although there are many reported associations between microbiota compositional alterations and disease in adults, less is known about how microbiome development is altered in pediatric diseases. One pediatric disease linked to altered gut microbiota composition is cystic fibrosis (CF), a multi-organ genetic disease involving impaired chloride secretion across epithelia and heightened inflammation both in the gut and at other body sites. Here, we use shotgun metagenomics to profile the strain-level composition and developmental dynamics of the infant fecal microbiota from several CF and non-CF longitudinal cohorts spanning from birth to greater than 36 months of life. We identify a set of keystone species whose prevalence and abundance reproducibly define microbiota development in early life in non-CF infants, but are missing or decreased in relative abundance in infants with CF. The consequences of these CF-specific differences in gut microbiota composition and dynamics are a delayed pattern of microbiota maturation, persistent entrenchment in a transitional developmental phase, and subsequent failure to attain an adult-like stable microbiota. We also detect the increased relative abundance of oral-derived bacteria and higher levels of fungi in CF, features that are associated with decreased gut bacterial density in inflammatory bowel diseases. Our results define key differences in the gut microbiota during ontogeny in CF and suggest the potential for directed therapies to overcome developmental delays in microbiota maturation.",

    "abstract": "The SpaceX Inspiration4 mission provided a unique opportunity to study the impact of spaceflight on the human body. Biospecimen samples were collected from the crew at different stages of the mission, including before (L-92, L-44, L-3 days), during (FD1, FD2, FD3), and after (R+1, R+45, R+82, R+194 days) spaceflight, creating a longitudinal sample set. The collection process included samples such as venous blood, capillary dried blood spot cards, saliva, urine, stool, body swabs, capsule swabs, SpaceX Dragon capsule HEPA filter, and skin biopsies, which were processed to obtain aliquots of serum, plasma, extracellular vesicles, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. All samples were then processed in clinical and research laboratories for optimal isolation and testing of DNA, RNA, proteins, metabolites, and other biomolecules. This paper describes the complete set of collected biospecimens, their processing steps, and long-term biobanking methods, which enable future molecular assays and testing. As such, this study details a robust framework for obtaining and preserving high-quality human, microbial, and environmental samples for aerospace medicine in the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA) initiative, which can also aid future experiments in human spaceflight and space biology.",

Through a bottleneck process, finite groups are formed with cooperators and defectors sampled from an infinite pool. After the fragmentation, these transient compartments grow until the carrying capacity is attained. Eventually, all compartments are merged, well mixed and the whole process is repeated. We show that cooperators, even if interacting only through mean-field intra-group interactions that favor defectors, may perform well because of the inter-group competition and the size diversity among the compartments. These cycles of isolation and coalescence may therefore be important in maintaining diversity among different species or strategies and may help to understand the underlying mechanisms of the scaffolding processes in the transition to multicellularity.",

In many cases, cancers can be resistant to the drug prior to exposure, i.e., possess intrinsic drug resistance. However, we lack target-independent methods to anticipate resistance in cancer cell lines or characterize intrinsic drug resistance without a priori knowledge of its cause. We hypothesized that cell morphology could provide an unbiased readout of drug sensitivity prior to treatment. We therefore isolated clonal cell lines that were either sensitive or resistant to bortezomib, a well-characterized proteasome inhibitor and anticancer drug to which many cancer cells possess intrinsic resistance. We then measured high-dimensional single-cell morphology profiles using Cell Painting, a high-content microscopy assay. Our imaging- and computation-based profiling pipeline identified morphological features typically different between resistant and sensitive clones. These features were compiled to generate a morphological signature of bortezomib resistance, which correctly predicted the bortezomib treatment response in seven of ten cell lines not included in the training dataset. This signature of resistance was specific to bortezomib over other drugs targeting the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Our results provide evidence that intrinsic morphological features of drug resistance exist and establish a framework for their identification.",

Capitalizing on human intracranial recordings, we demonstrate that the functional specificity toward reward or punishment learning is better disentangled by interactions compared to local representations. Prefrontal and insular cortices display non-selective neural populations to reward and punishment. The non-selective responses, however, give rise to context-specific interareal interactions. We identify a reward subsystem with redundant interactions between the orbitofrontal and ventromedial prefrontal cortices, with a driving role of the latter. In addition, we find a punishment subsystem with redundant interactions between the insular and dorsolateral cortices, with a driving role of the insula. Finally, switching between reward and punishment learning is mediated by synergistic interactions between the two subsystems. These results provide a unifying explanation of distributed cortical representations and interactions supporting reward and punishment learning.",

    "abstract": "Studies of allele-specific expression in interspecific hybrids have provided important insights into gene-regulatory divergence and hybrid incompatibilities. Many such investigations in Drosophila have used transcriptome data from whole animals or gonads, however, regulatory divergence may vary widely among species, sex, and tissues. Thus, we lack sufficiently broad sampling of tissues to be confident about the general principles of regulatory divergence. Here we seek to fill some of these gaps in the literature by characterizing regulatory evolution and hybrid misexpression in a somatic male sex organ, the accessory gland, in F1 hybrids between Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans. The accessory gland produces seminal fluid proteins, which play an important role in male and female fertility and may be subject to adaptive divergence due to male-male or male-female interactions. We find that trans differences are relatively more abundant than cis, in contrast to most of the interspecific hybrid literature, though large effect-size trans differences are rare. Seminal fluid protein genes have significantly elevated levels of expression divergence and tend to be regulated through both cis and trans divergence. We find limited misexpression in this organ compared to other Drosophila studies. As in previous studies, male-biased genes are overrepresented among misexpressed genes and are much more likely to be underexpressed. ATAC-Seq data show that chromatin accessibility is correlated with expression differences among species and hybrid allele-specific expression. This work identifies unique regulatory evolution and hybrid misexpression properties of the accessory gland and suggests the importance of tissue-specific allele-specific expression studies.",

    "abstract": "The occurrence of acute sepsis-associated lung injury (ALI) is closely related to vascular endothelial cell dysfunction, but the exact isoform of the functional syndecans (SDCs) located in the inner endothelial membrane of blood vessels and involved in regulating inflammation is not clear. The present study aimed to clarify whether SDC2 and/or 4 is involved in the inflammation process.Using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were extracted and analyzed. A bioinformatic analysis was conducted using R language, gene ontology (GO), and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) with the aim of predicting SDC2 and 4 expression levels. Subsequently, the expression profiles of these two proteins were examined after construction of a sepsis-associated ALI mmodel was constructed in both human lung vascular endothelial cells (HLVEC) and animal models under inflammatory conditions. Eventually, the transcription factors (TF) of SDC2/4 were predicted based on the available dataset, and their involvement in septic inflammation was indirectly assessed. The GSE 5883 microarray gene-chip data profile was found to be suitable for analyzing lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endothelial inflammatory injury. After analyzing the DEGs, 224 and 102 genes were found to be up- and down-regulated, respectively. All DEGs were involved in modulating receptor ligand and signaling receptor activator activities, cytokine receptor binding in biological processes, such as responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and molecules from bacterial origins, positive regulation of cell adhesion, and other functions. In the case of localization of cellular components, most DEGs were enriched in cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein granules, transcription regulator complex, and membrane rafts and were involved in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling and cytokine receptor interaction pathways. When compared with the control group, SDC4 gene expression in the LPS group increased by 4.5-fold, and comparable results were found in terms of SDC2 gene expression. From an experimental aspect, SDC4 was found to be markedly up-regulated with respect to mRNA and protein expression levels in response to inflammatory injury; moreover, down-regulation of SDC4 could severely exacerbate inflammatory responses either in in vivo or in vitro models. Altogether, SDC4, rather than SDC2, was found to be involved in LPS-induced sepsis-associated ALI.",

    "abstract": "The use of fMRI and computational modeling has advanced understanding of spatial characteristics of population receptive fields (pRFs) in human visual cortex. However, we know relatively little about the spatiotemporal characteristics of pRFs because neurons temporal properties are one to two orders of magnitude faster than fMRI BOLD responses. Here, we developed an image-computable framework to estimate spatiotemporal pRFs from fMRI data. First, we developed a simulation software that predicts fMRI responses to a time varying visual input given a spatiotemporal pRF model and solves the model parameters. The simulator revealed that ground-truth spatiotemporal parameters can be accurately recovered at the millisecond resolution from synthesized fMRI responses. Then, using fMRI and a novel stimulus paradigm, we mapped spatiotemporal pRFs in individual voxels across human visual cortex in 10 participants. We find that a compressive spatiotemporal (CST) pRF model better explains fMRI responses than a conventional spatial pRF model across visual areas spanning the dorsal, lateral, and ventral streams. Further, we find three organizational principles of spatiotemporal pRFs: (i) from early to later areas within a visual stream, spatial and temporal integration windows of pRFs progressively increase in size and show greater compressive nonlinearities, (ii) later visual areas show diverging spatial and temporal integration windows across streams, and (iii) within early visual areas (V1-V3), both spatial and temporal integration windows systematically increase with eccentricity. Together, this computational framework and empirical results open exciting new possibilities for modeling and measuring fine-grained spatiotemporal dynamics of neural responses in the human brain using fMRI.\n\nSignificance StatementWe developed a computational framework for estimating spatiotemporal receptive fields of neural populations using fMRI. This framework pushes the boundary of fMRI measurements, enabling quantitative evaluation of neural spatial and temporal processing windows at the resolution of visual degrees and milliseconds, which was thought to be unattainable with fMRI. We not only replicate well-established visual field and pRF size maps, but also estimates of temporal summation windows from electrophysiology. Notably, we find that spatial and temporal windows as well as compressive nonlinearities progressively increase from early to later visual areas in multiple visual processing streams. Together, this framework opens exciting new possibilities for modeling and measuring fine-grained spatiotemporal dynamics of neural responses in the human brain using fMRI.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLinezolid is an antibiotic used to treat serious Staphylococcus aureus infections. Resistance to linezolid is considered rare but could emerge with repeated dosing. We recently reported widespread prescription of linezolid for a cohort of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).\n\nObjectivesThe goals of this study were to determine the incidence of linezolid resistance in CF and identify molecular mechanisms for linezolid resistance.\n\nMethodsWe identified patients with S. aureus resistant to linezolid (MIC > 4) at the University of Iowa CF Center between 2008 and 2018. We obtained isolates from these patients and retested susceptibility to linezolid using broth microdilution. We used whole genome sequencing to perform phylogenetic analysis of linezolid resistant isolates and examine sequences for mutations or accessory genes that confer linezolid resistance.\n\nMain ResultsBetween 2008 and 2018, 111 patients received linezolid and 4 of these patients cultured linezolid resistant S. aureus. We sequenced 11 resistant and 21 susceptible isolates from these 4 subjects. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that linezolid resistance developed in ST5 or ST105 backgrounds. Three individuals had linezolid resistant S. aureus with a G2576T mutation in 23S rRNA. One of these subjects additionally had a mutS- mutL- hypermutating S. aureus that produced 5 resistant isolates with multiple ribosomal subunit mutations. In one subject, the genetic basis for linezolid resistance was unclear.\n\nConclusionsLinezolid resistance evolved in 4 of 111 patients in this study. Linezolid resistance occurred by multiple genetic mechanisms. All resistant strains developed in ST5 or ST105 MRSA backgrounds.\n\nKey PointLinezolid resistance arises through multiple genetic mechanisms and could be facilitated by mutator phenotypes. Linezolid resistance was transient, possibly due to growth disadvantage.",

    "abstract": "Pairwise interactions are often used to predict features of complex microbial communities due to the challenge of measuring multi-species interactions in high dimensional contexts. This assumes that interactions are unaffected by community context. Here, we used synthetic bacterial communities to investigate that assumption by observing how interactions varied across contexts. Interactions were most often weakly negative and showed clear phylogenetic signal. Community richness and total density emerged as strong predictors of interaction strength and contributed to an attenuation of interactions as richness increased. Population level and per-capita measures of interactions both displayed such attenuation, suggesting factors beyond systematic changes in population size were involved; namely, changes to the interactions themselves. Nevertheless, pairwise interactions retained some predictive value across contexts, provided those contexts were not substantially diverged in richness. These results suggest that understanding the emergent properties of microbial interactions can improve our ability to predict features of microbial communities.",

    "abstract": "An aliphatic halogenase requires four substrates: 2-oxoglutarate (2OG), halide (Cl- or Br-), the halogenation target (\"prime substrate\"), and dioxygen. In well-studied cases, the three non-gaseous substrates must bind to activate the enzymes Fe(II) cofactor for efficient capture of O2. Halide, 2OG, and (lastly) O2 all coordinate directly to the cofactor to initiate its conversion to a cis-halo-oxo-iron(IV) (haloferryl) complex, which abstracts hydrogen (H*) from the non-coordinating prime substrate to enable radicaloid carbon-halogen coupling. We dissected the kinetic pathway and thermodynamic linkage in binding of the first three substrates of the O_SCPLOWLC_SCPLOW-lysine 4-chlorinase, BesD. After 2OG adds, subsequent coordination of the halide to the cofactor and binding of cationic O_SCPLOWLC_SCPLOW-Lys near the cofactor are associated with strong heterotropic cooperativity. Progression to the haloferryl intermediate upon addition of O2 does not trap the substrates in the active site and, in fact, markedly diminishes cooperativity between halide and O_SCPLOWLC_SCPLOW-Lys. The surprising lability of the BesD*[Fe(IV)=O]*Cl*succinate*O_SCPLOWLC_SCPLOW-Lys complex engenders pathways for decay of the haloferryl intermediate that do not result in O_SCPLOWLC_SCPLOW-Lys chlorination, especially at low chloride concentrations; one identified pathway involves oxidation of glycerol. The mechanistic data imply that (i) BesD may have evolved from a hydroxylase ancestor either relatively recently or under weak selective pressure for efficient chlorination and (ii) that acquisition of its activity may have involved the emergence of linkage between O_SCPLOWLC_SCPLOW-Lys binding and chloride coordination following loss of the anionic protein-carboxylate iron ligand present in extant hydroxylases.",

Tumor cell-cell and cell-microenvironment interactions significantly influence tumor progression and invasion, which have important implications for diagnosis, therapeutic treatment and chemoresistance.\n\nMethodIn this study, we develop 3D bioprinted in vitro models of the breast cancer tumor microenvironment (TME) made of co-cultured cells distributed in a hydrogel matrix with controlled architecture to model tumor heterogeneity. We hypothesize that the tumor could be represented by a cancer cell-laden co-culture hydrogel construct, whereas its microenvironment can be modeled in a microfluidic chip capable of producing a chemical gradient. Breast cancer cells (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231) and non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells (MCF10) were embedded in the alginate-gelatine hydrogels and printed using a multi-cartridge extrusion bioprinter.\n\nResultsOur method gives special control on the cell positions in the co-culture system, whereas different tumor architectures can be designed. Cellularly heterogeneous samples comprised of two different cancer cells with controlled density are developed in specific initial locations, i.e. two cell types randomly mixed or positioned in sequential layers. A migration-inducing chemical microenvironment was created in a chamber with a gradual chemical gradient to study the cell migration in the complex tumor construct toward the chemoattractant. As a proof of concept, the different migration pattern of MC7 cells toward the epithelial growth factor gradient was studied with presence of MCF10 in different ratio in this device.\n\nConclusionCombining 3D bioprinting with microfluidic device in our method provides a great tool to create different tumor architectures as can be seen in different patients, and study cancer cells behaviour with accurate special and temporal resolution.",

    "abstract": "Network-based machine learning (ML) has the potential for predicting novel genes associated with nearly any health and disease context. However, this approach often uses network information from only the single species under consideration even though networks for most species are noisy and incomplete. While some recent methods have begun addressing this shortcoming by using networks from more than one species, they lack one or more key desirable properties: handling networks from multiple species, incorporating many-to-many orthology information, or generating a network representation that is reusable across different types of and newly-defined prediction tasks. Here, we present GenePlexusZoo, a framework that casts molecular networks from multiple species into a single reusable feature space for network-based ML. We demonstrate that this multi-species network representation improves both gene classification within a single species and knowledge-transfer across species, even in cases where the inter-species correspondence is undetectable based on shared orthologous genes. Thus, GenePlexusZoo enables effectively leveraging the high evolutionary molecular, functional, and phenotypic conservation across species to discover novel genes associated with diverse biological contexts.",

    "abstract": "The forthcoming assembly of the adult Drosophila melanogaster central brain connectome, containing over 125,000 neurons and 50 million synaptic connections, provides a template for examining sensory processing throughout the brain. Here, we create a leaky integrate-and-fire computational model of the entire Drosophila brain, based on neural connectivity and neurotransmitter identity, to study circuit properties of feeding and grooming behaviors. We show that activation of sugar-sensing or water-sensing gustatory neurons in the computational model accurately predicts neurons that respond to tastes and are required for feeding initiation. Computational activation of neurons in the feeding region of the Drosophila brain predicts those that elicit motor neuron firing, a testable hypothesis that we validate by optogenetic activation and behavioral studies. Moreover, computational activation of different classes of gustatory neurons makes accurate predictions of how multiple taste modalities interact, providing circuit-level insight into aversive and appetitive taste processing. Our computational model predicts that the sugar and water pathways form a partially shared appetitive feeding initiation pathway, which our calcium imaging and behavioral experiments confirm. Additionally, we applied this model to mechanosensory circuits and found that computational activation of mechanosensory neurons predicts activation of a small set of neurons comprising the antennal grooming circuit that do not overlap with gustatory circuits, and accurately describes the circuit response upon activation of different mechanosensory subtypes. Our results demonstrate that modeling brain circuits purely from connectivity and predicted neurotransmitter identity generates experimentally testable hypotheses and can accurately describe complete sensorimotor transformations.",

Recently, nitrogenases were shown to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide to hydrocarbons, offering a pathway to recycle carbon waste into hydrocarbon products. Among the nitrogenase family the iron nitrogenase is the isozyme with the highest wildtype activity for the reduction of CO2, but the molecular architecture facilitating these activities remained unknown. Here, we report a 2.35-[A] cryogenic electron microscopy structure of the Fe nitrogenase complex from Rhodobacter capsulatus, revealing an [Fe8S9C-(R)-homocitrate]-cluster in the active site. The enzyme complex suggests that the AnfG-subunit is involved in cluster stabilisation, substrate channelling and confers specificity between nitrogenase reductase and catalytic components. Moreover, the structure highlights a different interface between the two catalytic halves of the iron and the molybdenum nitrogenase, potentially influencing the intra-subunit  communication and thus the nitrogenase mechanism.",

    "abstract": "MotivationToday, we know the function of only a small fraction of all known protein sequences identified. This problem is even more salient in bacteria as human-centric studies are prioritized in the field and there is much to uncover in the bacterial genetic repertoire. Conventional approaches to bacterial gene annotation are especially inadequate for annotating previously unseen proteins in novel species since there are no proteins with similar sequence in the existing databases. Thus, we need alternative representations of proteins. Recently, there has been an uptick in interest in adopting natural language processing methods to solve challenging bioinformatics tasks; in particular using transformer-based language models to represent proteins has proven successful in tackling various challenges. However, there are still limited applications of such representations in bacteria.\n\nResultsWe developed SAP, a novel synteny-aware gene function prediction tool based on protein embeddings, to annotate bacterial species. SAP distinguishes itself from existing methods for annotating bacteria in two ways: (i) it uses embedding vectors extracted from state-of-the-art protein language models and (ii) it incorporates conserved synteny across the entire bacterial kingdom using a novel operon-based approach proposed in our work. SAP outperformed conventional annotation methods on a range of representative bacteria, for various gene prediction tasks including distant homolog detection where the sequence similarity between training and test proteins was 40% at its lowest. SAP also achieved annotation coverage on par with conventional structure-based predictors in a real-life application on Enterococcus genes of unknown function.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/AbeelLab/sap\n\nContactt.abeel@tudelft.nl\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

We quantitatively compare the density dependence of single-molecule light field microscopy (SMLFM) to other 3D PSFs (astigmatism, double helix and tetrapod) showing that SMFLM enables an order-of-magnitude speed improvement compared to the double helix PSF by resolving overlapping emitters through parallax.

    "abstract": "A recurring issue in functional neuroimaging is how to link task-driven hemodynamic BOLD-fMRI responses to underlying neurochemistry at the synaptic level. Glutamate and GABA, the major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters respectively, are typically measured with MR spectroscopy (MRS) sequences in a resting state, in the absence of a task. We propose to resolve this disconnect by applying a novel method to concurrently acquire BOLD, Glx and GABA measurements from a single voxel, using a locally adapted MEGA-PRESS sequence implementation which incorporates unsuppressed water reference signals at a regular interval, allowing continuous assessment of BOLD-related linewidth variation for fMRS applications.\n\nHealthy subjects (N = 81) performed a cognitive task (Eriksen Flanker) which was presented visually in a task-OFF, task-ON block design, with individual event stimulus timing varied with respect to the MRS readout. BOLD data acquired with the adapted MEGA-PRESS sequence were correlated with data acquired using a standard fMRI EPI sequence as a means of validating the concurrent approach: a significant (although moderate) correlation was observed, specific to the fMRS-targeted region of interest. We additionally present a novel linear model for extracting modelled spectra associated with discrete functional stimuli, building on well-established processing and quantification tools. Behavioural outcomes from the Flanker task, and activation patterns from the BOLD-fMRI sequence, were as expected from the literature. fMRS-assessed BOLD response correlated strongly with slowing of response time in the incongruent Flanker condition. Moreover, there was a significant increase in measured Glx levels (~8.8%), between task-OFF and task-ON periods. These findings verify the efficacy of our functional task and analysis pipelines for the simultaneous assessment of BOLD and metabolite fluctuations in a single voxel. As well as providing a robust basis for further work using these techniques, we also identify a number of clear directions for further refinement in future studies.\n\nHighlightsO_LIConcurrent measurement of temporally resolved metabolite estimates and local BOLD-related signal changes is demonstrated\nC_LIO_LIIn-vivo, GABA-edited functional 1H-MRS data were collected from 81 healthy subjects whilst they performed a cognitive task\nC_LIO_LIRobust task-related increases in measured Glutamate+Glutamine were observed in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex\nC_LIO_LIModerate correlation was observed between BOLD contrast strength as assessed by fMRS and fMRI techniques, specific to the prescribed region\nC_LIO_LIA novel technique for extraction of block- or event-related sub-spectra is demonstrated\nC_LI\n\nGraphical AbstractA novel sequence adaption for concurrent measurement of GABA-edited spectroscopy and functional BOLD changes is demonstrated on N=81 healthy subjects.

CEs biosynthesis is responsible by the enzymes acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase 1 and 2 (ACAT1 and ACAT2), with ACAT1 as the primary isoenzyme in most cells in humans. ACATs are targets for atherosclerosis therapies and may also be promising targets for treating Alzheimers Disease (AD). F12511 is a high-affinity ACAT1 inhibitor that has passed phase 1 safety tests for anti-atherosclerosis. Previously, we had developed a nanoparticle system to encapsulate a large concentration of F12511 into a stealth liposome (DSPE-PEG2000 with egg phosphatidylcholine). Here, we injected the nanoparticle encapsulated F12511 (nanoparticle F) intravenously (IV) to wild-type (WT) mice and performed HPLC/MS/MS analysis and ACAT enzyme activity measurement. The results demonstrated that F12511 was present within the mouse brain after a single IV but did not over-accumulate in the brain or other tissues after repeated IVs. Histological examination showed that F12511 did not cause overt neurological or systemic toxicity. We then showed that 2-week IV delivery of nanoparticle F to aging 3xTg AD mice ameliorated amyloidopathy, reduced hyperphosphorylated tau and non-phosphorylated tau, and reduced neuroinflammation. This work lays the foundation with nanoparticle F as a possible therapy for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

Measuring rooting depth, however, is challenging due to the destructive, laborious, or imprecise methods that are currently available. Here, we present LEADER (Leaf Element Accumulation from DEep Roots) as a method to estimate in-field root depth of maize plants. We use both X-Ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) and ICP-OES (Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission spectroscopy) to measure leaf elemental content and relate this to metrics of root depth. Principal components of leaf elemental content correlate with measures of root length in four genotypes (R2= 0.8 for total root length), and we use linear discriminant analysis to classify plants as having different metrics related to root depth across four field sites in the United States. We can correctly classify the plots with the longest root length at depth with high accuracy (accuracy greater than 0.6) at two of our field sites (Hancock, WI and Rock Spring, PA). We also use strontium (Sr) as a tracer element in both greenhouse and field studies, showing that elemental accumulation of Sr in leaf tissue can be measured with XRF and can estimate root depth. We propose the adoption of LEADER as a tool for measuring root depth in different plant species and soils. LEADER is faster and easier than any other methods that currently exist and could allow for extensive study and understanding of deep rooting.",
