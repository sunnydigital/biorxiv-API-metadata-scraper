    "abstract": "Image differences between the eyes can cause interocular discrepancies in the speed of visual processing. Millisecond-scale differences in visual processing speed can cause dramatic misperceptions of the depth and 3D direction of moving objects. Here, we develop a monocular and binocular continuous target-tracking psychophysics paradigm that can quantify such tiny differences in visual processing speed. Human observers continuously tracked a target undergoing Brownian motion with a range of luminance levels in each eye. Suitable analyses recover the time-course of the visuomotor response in each condition, the dependence of visual processing speed on luminance level, and the temporal evolution of processing differences between the eyes. Importantly, using a direct within-observer comparison, we show that continuous target-tracking and traditional forced-choice psychophysical methods provide estimates of interocular delays that agree on average to within a fraction of a millisecond. Thus, visual processing delays are preserved in the movement dynamics of the hand. Finally, we show analytically, and partially confirm experimentally, that differences between the temporal impulse response functions in the two eyes predicts how lateral target motion causes misperceptions of motion-in-depth and associated tracking responses. Because continuous target-tracking can accurately recover millisecond-scale differences in visual processing speed and has multiple advantages over traditional psychophysics, it should facilitate the study of temporal processing in the future.",

    "abstract": "Polygenic risk scores, or PRS, are a tool to estimate individuals liabilities to a disease or trait measurement based solely on genetic information. One commonly discussed potential use is in the clinic to identify people who are at greater risk of developing a disease. In this paper, we compare three PRS models that incorporate a large number of genetic markers for coronary artery disease (CAD). In the UK Biobank, the cohort which was used at some point in the creation or validation of each score, we calculated the association between CAD, the scores, and population structure for the white British subset. After adjusting for geographic and socioeconomic factors, CAD was not associated with the first principal components of genetic diversity, which reflect fine-scale population structure. In contrast, all three scores were confounded by these genetic components, highlighting that PRS may be influenced by genetic factors not directly causal for CAD, thereby raising concerns about their biases in clinical application.Furthermore, we investigated the differences in risk stratification using four different UK Biobank assessment centers as separate cohorts, and tested how missing genetic data affected risk stratification through simulation. We show that missing data impact classification for extreme individuals for high- and low-risk, and quantiles of risk are sensitive to individual-level genotype missingness. Distributions of scores varied between assessment centers, revealing that thresholding based on quantiles can be problematic for consistency across centers and populations. Based on these results, we discuss potential avenues of improvements of PRS methodologies for usage in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Sequence classification reduces the complexity of metagenomes and facilitates a fundamental understanding of the structure and function of microbial communities. Binary metagenomic classifiers offer an insufficient solution because environmental metagenomes are typically derived from multiple sequence sources, including prokaryotes, eukaryotes and the viruses of both. Here we introduce a deep-learning based (as opposed to alignment-based) sequence classifier, DeepMicroClass, that classifies metagenomic contigs into five sequence classes, i.e., viruses infecting prokaryotic or eukaryotic hosts, eukaryotic or prokaryotic chromosomes, and prokaryotic plasmids. At different sequence lengths, DeepMicroClass achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores >0.98 for most sequence classes, with the exception of distinguishing plasmids from prokaryotic chromosomes (AUC scores{approx} 0.97). By benchmarking on 20 designed datasets with variable sequence class composition, we showed that DeepMicroClass obtained average accuracy scores of [~]0.99, [~]0.97, and [~]0.99 for eukaryotic, plasmid and viral contig classification, respectively, which were significantly higher than the other state-of-the-art individual predictors. Using a 1-300 {micro}m daily time-series metagenomic dataset sampled from coastal Southern California as a case study, we showed that metagenomic read proportions recruited by eukaryotic contigs could be doubled with DeepMicroClasss classification compared to the counterparts of other alignment-based classifiers. With its inclusive modeling and unprecedented performance, we expect DeepMicroClass will be a useful addition to the toolbox of microbial ecologists, and will promote metagenomic studies of under-appreciated sequence types.",

This subdomain, the flagellar pocket, is a small vase-shaped invagination containing the root of the cells single flagellum. Several cytoskeleton-associated multiprotein complexes are coiled around the neck of the flagellar pocket on its cytoplasmic face. One of these, the hook complex, was proposed to affect macromolecule entry into the flagellar pocket lumen. In previous work, knockdown of the hook complex component TbMORN1 resulted in larger cargo being unable to enter the flagellar pocket. In this study, the hook complex component TbSmee1 was characterised in bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei and was found to be essential for cell viability. TbSmee1 knockdown resulted in flagellar pocket enlargement and impaired access to the flagellar pocket membrane by surface-bound cargo, similar to depletion of TbMORN1. Unexpectedly, inhibition of endocytosis by knockdown of clathrin phenocopied TbSmee1 knockdown, suggesting that endocytic activity itself is a prerequisite for the entry of surface-bound cargo into the flagellar pocket.\n\nSummaryCharacterisation of the essential trypanosome protein TbSmee1 suggests that endocytosis is required for flagellar pocket access of surface-bound cargo.",

    "abstract": "Traditionally, when conducting voxel- or vertex-wise analyses in neuroimaging studies, it seemed imperative that brain data are convoluted with a Gaussian kernel, a procedure known as \"spatial smoothing\". However, we suggest that - under certain conditions - smoothing may be omitted for the benefit of an improved regional specificity. We demonstrate the suitability of this omission by combining high-dimensional spatial registration and threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) in a sample of 754 brains. Our findings revealed that, without smoothing, it is possible to capture brain atrophy within the hippocampal complex while dissociating neighboring areas (cornu ammonis, dentate gyrys, subiculum, and amygdala). In contrast, the traditional smoothing step would result in a single hippocampal cluster (the larger the smoothing kernel, the lower the specificity). Supplemental analyses not only varying the size of the smoothing kernel, but also the size of the sample, the signal-to-noise ratio, as well as the accuracy of the spatial registration confirm that no smoothing (or less smoothing) leads to increased specificity while maintaining sensitivity, at least for small-scale structures (e.g., hippocampus and amygdala). Nevertheless, classic analyses based on smoothed data will continue to provide important insights, especially for large-scale structures (e.g., cortical regions).",

Here, we examined a recently developed method for expanding rigorously purified murine HSCs ex vivo. After three weeks of culture, only 0.1% of cells exhibited the input HSC phenotype, but these accounted for almost all functional long-term HSC activity. Input HSCs displayed varying potential for ex vivo self-renewal, with alternative outcomes revealed by single cell multimodal RNA- and ATAC-seq profiling. While most HSC progeny offered only transient in vivo reconstitution, these cells efficiently rescued mice from lethal myeloablation. The amplification of functional HSC activity allowed for long-term multilineage engraftment in unconditioned hosts that associated with a return of HSCs to quiescence.

Breeding periods in amphibians have received little attention despite amphibian reliance on climate and water due to their reproductive biology and ecological diversity. The aim of this study is to determine how global climate impacts breeding periods in ectothermic animals through physiology, body size, and microhabitat.\n\nLocationAll continents, except Antarctica.\n\nTime periodBreeding periods and climate both dating as far back as 1970.\n\nMajor taxa studied497 (7%) anuran species of 41 (76%) families.\n\nMethodsWe used phylogenetic comparative methods to analyze a global dataset of frog breeding periods, climate, body size, and microhabitat for 497 species.\n\nResultsWe found support for a global latitudinal gradient of breeding periods which are longer in the warmer, wetter tropics while shorter in the colder, dryer temperate zone. Latitudinal and non-latitudinal global patterns of breeding period were composites of the same patterns in the temperate and tropical zones. However, the effect of climate and body size in each zone is unique. Breeding periods displayed weak phylogenetic signal and were similar across microhabitats.\n\nMain conclusionsBreeding periods show a global latitudinal gradient but this concept breaks down within the tropical zone. Our results are consistent with the importance of physiology in driving breeding periods and we describe how breeding period and body size may exhibit trade-offs which make latitudinal gradients context-dependent. Our results set within an ecophysiological framework have broad implications for understanding reproductive diversity in other ectothermic organisms.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety and chronic pain afflict hundreds of millions worldwide. Both anxiety and pain are more prevalent in females compared to males. Unfortunately, robust sex differences in human anxiety are not recapitulated in rodent tests, and results from rodent pain studies frequently fail to translate clinically. Therefore, there is a need to develop tests that reflect the differential salience of anxiety or pain-related stimuli between the sexes. Accordingly, here we introduce the Thermal Increments Dark-Light (TIDAL) conflict test. The TIDAL test places an anxiety-relevant stimulus (dark vs. illuminated chamber) in conflict with a heat-related stimulus (incrementally heated vs. isothermic chamber); mice freely explore the dark-heating and illuminated-isothermic chambers. Here, we aim to determine whether the TIDAL conflict test reveals in mice underappreciated sex differences in anxiety and/or heat sensitivity. We establish in four distinct experiments that females on the TIDAL conflict test persist substantially longer on the dark-heated plate, suggesting that females as compared to males exhibit elevated anxiety-like behavior. Mice more strongly prefer the dark plate on the TIDAL conflict test compared to control thermal place preference with both chambers illuminated. We also reveal that an anxiety-relieving drug, paroxetine, reduces mouse preference for the heating dark plate, supporting the validity of the TIDAL test. Therefore, our new TIDAL conflict test reliably unmasks the relative salience of anxiety (vs. heat sensitivity): mice that are female exhibit robust anxiety-like behaviors not consistently observed in classical tests. Future studies should incorporate TIDAL and other conflict tests to better understand rodent behavior and to identify mechanisms underlying anxiety and pain.",

    "abstract": "Neurons in the mammalian inferior colliculus (IC) are sensitive to the velocity (speed and direction) of fast frequency chirps contained in Schroeder-phase harmonic complexes (SCHR). However, IC neurons are also sensitive to stimulus periodicity, a prominent feature of SCHR stimuli. Here, to disentangle velocity sensitivity from periodicity tuning, we introduced a novel stimulus consisting of aperiodic random chirps. Extracellular, single-unit recordings were made in the IC of Dutch-belted rabbits in response to both SCHR and aperiodic chirps. Rate-velocity functions were constructed from aperiodic-chirp responses and compared to SCHR rate profiles, revealing interactions between stimulus periodicity and neural velocity sensitivity. A generalized linear model analysis demonstrated that periodicity tuning influences SCHR response rates more strongly than velocity sensitivity. Principal component analysis of rate-velocity functions revealed that neurons were more often sensitive to the direction of lower-velocity chirps and were less often sensitive to the direction of higher-velocity chirps. Overall, these results demonstrate that sensitivity to chirp velocity is common in the IC. Harmonic sounds with complex phase spectra, such as speech and music, contain chirps, and velocity sensitivity would shape IC responses to these sounds.\n\nHighlightsO_LIIC neurons had diverse sensitivity to chirp velocity (speed and direction) of periodic and aperiodic-chirp stimuli.\nC_LIO_LIBoth velocity and periodicity sensitivity were necessary to predict neural responses to Schroeder-phase harmonic complexes.\nC_LIO_LINeurons were more commonly sensitive to the direction of chirps at lower-speeds (e.g., < 2 kHz/ms) than higher-speeds (e.g., > 2 kHz/ms) in the tested range.\nC_LIO_LIThe chirp speeds for which IC neurons were most sensitive are present in common harmonic sounds with realistic phase spectra, such as speech and music.\nC_LI",

The idea of estimating the chronological age from magnetic resonance images proved to be an interesting field of research due to the relative simplicity of its interpretation and its potential use as a biomarker of brain health. We revised the BrainAGE approach, originally utilising relevance vector regression (RVR), and substituted it with Gaussian process regression (GPR), which enables more stable processing of larger datasets, such as the UK Biobank (UKB). We tested the performance of the new model under several different conditions and investigated its validity on healthy and neurologically impaired subjects of the ADNI sample and on a synthetic dataset of neocortical thinning. The results show an improved performance of the reframed model with a MAE of 1.97 years on a UKB sample and a significant difference in BrainAGE between healthy participants and patients with Alzheimers disease. Moreover, the workings of the algorithm show meaningful effects for a simulated neocortical atrophy dataset. The results demonstrate that the new improved algorithm provides reliable and valid brain age estimations.",

To bridge the gap in our understanding of the link between living in poverty and adverse health outcomes, we performed RNA sequencing of blood immune cells from 204 participants of the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study in Baltimore, Maryland.

In this paper, we present an efficient method to choose a minimal predictive subset of markers that for the first time allows the prediction of full images for a much larger set of markers. We demonstrate that our approach also outperforms previous methods for predicting cell-level marker composition. Most importantly, we demonstrate that our approach can be used to select a marker set that enables prediction of a much larger set that could not be measured concurrently.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) is critical for the production of functional viral proteins during infection and, like many viral proteases, can also target host proteins to subvert their cellular functions. Here, we show that the human tRNA methyltransferase TRMT1 can be recognized and cleaved by SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. TRMT1 installs the N2,N2-dimethylguanosine (m2,2G) modification on mammalian tRNAs, which promotes global protein synthesis and cellular redox homeostasis. We find that Mpro can cleave endogenous TRMT1 in human cell lysate, resulting in removal of the TRMT1 zinc finger domain required for tRNA modification activity in cells. Evolutionary analysis shows that the TRMT1 cleavage site is highly conserved in mammals, except in Muroidea, where TRMT1 may be resistant to cleavage. In primates, regions outside the cleavage site with rapid evolution could indicate adaptation to ancient viral pathogens. We determined the structure of a TRMT1 peptide in complex with Mpro, revealing a substrate binding conformation distinct from the majority of available Mpro-peptide complexes. Kinetic parameters for peptide cleavage showed that the TRMT1(526-536) sequence is cleaved with comparable efficiency to the Mpro-targeted nsp8/9 viral cleavage site. Mutagenesis studies and molecular dynamics simulations together indicate that kinetic discrimination occurs during a later step of Mpro-mediated proteolysis that follows substrate binding. Our results provide new information about the structural basis for Mpro substrate recognition and cleavage that could help inform future therapeutic design and raise the possibility that proteolysis of human TRMT1 during SARS-CoV-2 infection suppresses protein translation and oxidative stress response to impact viral pathogenesis.\n\nSignificance StatementViral proteases can strategically target human proteins to manipulate host biochemistry during infection. Here, we show that the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) can specifically recognize and cleave the human tRNA methyltransferase enzyme TRMT1, which installs a modification on human tRNAs that is critical for protein translation. Our structural and functional analysis of the Mpro-TRMT1 interaction shows how the flexible Mpro active site engages a conserved sequence in TRMT1 in an uncommon binding mode to catalyze its cleavage and inactivation. These studies provide new insights into substrate recognition by SARS-CoV-2 Mpro that could inform future antiviral therapeutic design and suggest that proteolysis of TRMT1 during SARS-CoV-2 infection may disrupt tRNA modification and host translation to impact COVID-19 pathogenesis or phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Dispersal, and in particular the frequency of long-distance dispersal (LDD) events, has strong im-plications for population dynamics with possibly the acceleration of the colonisation front, and for evolution with possibly the conservation of genetic diversity along the colonised domain. How-ever, accurately inferring LDD is challenging as it requires both large-scale data and a method-ology that encompasses the redistribution of individuals in time and space. Here, we propose a mechanistic-statistical framework to estimate dispersal from one-dimensional invasions. The mech-anistic model takes into account population growth and grasps the diversity in dispersal processes by using either diffusion, leading to a reaction-diffusion (R.D.) formalism, or kernels, leading to an integro-differential (I.D.) formalism. The latter considers different dispersal kernels (e.g. Gaussian, Exponential, and Exponential-power) differing in their frequency of LDD events. The statistical model relies on dedicated observation laws that describe two types of samples, clumped or not. As such, we take into account the variability in both habitat suitability and occupancy perception. We first check the identifiability of the parameters and the confidence in the selection of the dis-persal process. We observed good identifiability for nearly all parameters (Correlation Coefficient > 0.95 between true and fitted values), except for occupancy perception (Correlation Coefficient = 0.83 - 0.85). The dispersal process that is the most confidently identified is Exponential-Power (i.e. fat-tailed) kernel. We then applied our framework to data describing an annual invasion of the poplar rust disease along the Durance River valley over nearly 200 km. This spatio-temporal survey consisted of 12 study sites examined at seven time points. We confidently estimated that the dispersal of poplar rust is best described by an Exponential-power kernel with a mean dispersal dis-tance of 2.01 km and an exponent parameter of 0.24 characterising a fat-tailed kernel with frequent LDD events. By considering the whole range of possible dispersal processes our method forms a robust inference framework. It can be employed for a variety of organisms, provided they are monitored in time and space along a one-dimension invasion.",

    "abstract": "There are approximately 500 known origins of replication in the yeast genome, and the process by which DNA replication initiates at these locations is well understood. In particular, these sites are made competent to initiate replication by loading of the Mcm replicative helicase prior to the start of S phase; thus, \"a site to which MCM is bound in G1\" might be considered to provide an operational definition of a replication origin. By fusing a subunit of Mcm to micrococcal nuclease, a technique referred to as \"Chromatin Endogenous Cleavage\", we previously showed that known origins are typically bound by a single Mcm double hexamer, loaded adjacent to the ARS consensus sequence (ACS). Here we extend this analysis from known origins to the entire genome, identifying candidate Mcm binding sites whose signal intensity varies over at least 3 orders of magnitude. Published data quantifying the production of ssDNA during S phase showed clear evidence of replication initiation among the most abundant 1600 of these sites, with replication activity decreasing in concert with Mcm abundance and disappearing at the limit of detection of ssDNA. Three other hallmarks of replication origins were apparent among the most abundant 5,500 sites. Specifically, these sites (1) appeared in intergenic nucleosome-free regions that were flanked on one or both sides by well-positioned nucleosomes; (2) were flanked by ACSs; and (3) exhibited a pattern of GC skew characteristic of replication initiation. Furthermore, the high resolution of this technique allowed us to demonstrate a strong bias for detecting Mcm double-hexamers downstream rather than upstream of the ACS, which is consistent with the directionality of Mcm loading by Orc that has been observed in vitro. We conclude that, if sites at which Mcm double-hexamers are loaded can function as replication origins, then DNA replication origins are at least 3-fold more abundant than previously assumed, and we suggest that replication may occasionally initiate in essentially every intergenic region. These results shed light on recent reports that as many as 15% of replication events initiate outside of known origins, and this broader distribution of replication origins suggest that S phase in yeast may be less distinct from that in humans than is widely assumed.",

    "abstract": "Urbanization is a worldwide phenomenon that modifies the environment. By affecting the reservoirs of pathogens and the body and immune conditions of hosts, urbanization alters the epidemiological dynamics and diversity of diseases. Cities could act as areas of pathogen dilution or amplification, depending on whether urban features have positive or negative effects on vectors and hosts. In this study, we investigated the prevalence and diversity of avian malaria parasites (Plasmodium/Haemoproteus sp. and Leucocytozoon sp.) in great tits (Parus major) living across an urbanization gradient. In general, we observed high prevalence in adult birds (from 95% to 100%), yet lower prevalence in fledglings (from 0% to 38%). Malaria prevalence tended to increase with increasing urbanization in adults. Urban nestlings had higher Plasmodium sp. infection rates than non-urban nestlings. We found evidence of higher diversity of parasites in the most natural urban park; however, parasite diversity was similar across other urbanization levels (e.g. from a little artificialized park to a highly anthropized industrial area). Parasite lineages were not habitat specific. Only one Plasmodium sp. lineage (YWT4) was associated with urban areas and some rare lineages (e.g., AFR065) were present only in a zoo area, perhaps because of the presence of African birds. This study suggests that urbanization can lead to a parasite amplification effect and can favour different avian malaria lineages. Such results rise concern about the high risk of epidemics in urban habitats.",

    "abstract": "Cytoplasmic dynein is the primary motor that drives the motility and force generation functions towards the microtubule minus end. The activation of dynein motility requires its assembly with dynactin and a cargo adaptor. This process is facilitated by two dynein-associated factors, Lis1 and Nde1/Ndel1. Recent studies proposed that Lis1 rescues dynein from its autoinhibited conformation, but the physiological function of Nde1/Ndel1 remains elusive. Here, we investigated how human Nde1 and Lis1 regulate the assembly and subsequent motility of the mammalian dynein/dynactin complex using in vitro reconstitution and single molecule imaging. We found that Nde1 promotes the assembly of active dynein complexes in two distinct ways. Nde1 competes with the 2 subunit of platelet activator factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) 1B, which recruits Lis1 as a noncatalytic subunit and prevents its binding to dynein. Second, Nde1 recruits Lis1 to autoinhibited dynein and promotes Lis1-mediated assembly of dynein-dynactin-adaptor complexes. However, excess Nde1 inhibits dynein, presumably by competing against dynactin to bind the dynein intermediate chain. The association of dynactin with dynein triggers Nde1 dissociation before the initiation of dynein motility. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for how Nde1 and Lis1 synergistically activate the dynein transport machinery.",

We repeated the analysis with brain connectivity augmented with multi-synaptic neural pathways. RESULTS: We found 85 and 100 significant relationships with direct and augmented connectivity, respectively, which were generally stronger for augmented connectivity. Age was consistently linked to decreased connectivity, and healthier clinical scores were generally linked to increased connectivity. DISCUSSION: Our findings help to elucidate which structural brain networks are affected in Alzheimer's disease and aging and highlight the importance of including indirect connections.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWDepth estimation is an ill-posed problem: objects of different shapes or dimensions, even if at different distances, may project to the same image on the retina. Our brain uses several cues for depth estimation, including monocular cues such as motion parallax and binocular cues like diplopia. However, it is still unclear how the computations required for depth estimation are implemented in biologically plausible ways. State-of-the-art approaches to depth estimation based on deep neural networks implicitly describe the brain as a hierarchical feature detector. Instead, we propose an alternative approach that casts depth estimation as a problem of active inference. We show that depth can be inferred by inverting a hierarchical generative model that simultaneously predicts the eyes projections from a 2D belief over an object. Model inversion consists of a series of biologically plausible, homogeneous transformations based on Predictive Coding principles. Under the plausible assumption of a nonuniform fovea resolution, depth estimation favors an active vision strategy that fixates the object with the eyes, rendering the depth belief more accurate. This strategy is not realized by first fixating on a target and then estimating the depth, but by combining the two processes through action-perception cycles, with a similar mechanism of the saccades during object recognition. The proposed approach requires only local (top-down and bottom-up) message passing that can be implemented in biologically plausible neural circuits.",

    "abstract": "Nucleosome positioning is a key factor for transcriptional regulation. Nucleosomes regulate the dynamic accessibility of chromatin and interact with the transcription machinery at every stage. Influences to steer nucleosome positioning are diverse, and the according importance of the DNA sequence in contrast to active chromatin remodeling has been subject of long discussion. In this study, we evaluate the functional role of DNA sequence for all major elements along the process of transcription. We developed a random forest classifier based on local DNA structure that assesses the sequence-intrinsic support for nucleosome positioning. On this basis, we created a simple data resource that we applied genome-wide to the human genome. In our comprehensive analysis, we found a special role of DNA in mediating the competition of nucleosomes with cis-regulatory elements, in enabling steady transcription, for positioning of stable nucleosomes in exons and for repelling nucleosomes during transcription termination. In contrast, we relate these findings to concurrent processes that generate strongly positioned nucleosomes in vivo that are not mediated by sequence, such as energy-dependent remodeling of chromatin.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/550795v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (45K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@46167corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16e6180org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c34758org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@180ea7d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

This study leveraged a trans-omics analysis of longitudinal samples from trauma patients to illuminate molecular endotypes and trajectories that underpin patient outcomes. We hypothesized that trans-omics profiling reveals underlying clinical differences in severely injured patients that may present with similar clinical characteristics but ultimately have different responses to treatment and outcomes. Here we used proteomics and metabolomics to profile 759 of longitudinal plasma samples from 118 patients at 11 time points and 97 control subjects. Patients were stratified by shock and injury severity, revealing a spectrum of responses to trauma and treatment that are fundamentally tied to their unique underlying biology. Ensemble models were employed, demonstrating the predictive power of these molecular signatures with area under the receiver operating curves of 80 to 94% for key outcomes such as death. Then, transomics-based patient states were defined to create a map of unique pathophysiologic states encountered by trauma patients across time. Last, distinct longitudinal patient trajectories were identified that group patients according to their path through trauma transomics state maps. Unsupervised clustering of longitudinal trans-omics data identified specific clinical phenotypes while omics-based trajectories increased resolution on outcome prediction. The molecularly defined endotypes and trajectories provide an unprecedented lens to understand and potentially guide trauma patient management, opening a path towards precision medicine. This strategy presents a transformative framework that aligns with our understanding that trauma patients, despite similar clinical presentations, might harbor vastly different biological responses and outcomes.\n\nOne-sentence summaryTransomic analyses of longitudinal plasma samples from severely injured patients identifies endotypes and trajectories that predict clinical outcomes.",

Using a new fate mapping approach in transgenic chickens, we show that there is a small contribution of SHH expressing cells to the posterior ulna, posterior carpals and digit 3. We establish that while the majority of the ulna develops in response to paracrine SHH signaling in both the chicken and mouse, there are differences in the contribution of SHH expressing cells to other tissues of the zeugopod between these two species as well as between the chicken ulna and fibula.

To address this question, we developed a multi-dimensional task-set interference paradigm, in which people need to manage distraction from three independent dimensions. We use it to test whether people adapt to prior conflict by enhancing task-relevant information or suppressing task-irrelevant information. Three experiments provided strong evidence for the latter hypothesis. Moreover, control adaptation was highly dimension specific. Conflict from a given dimension only affected processing of that same dimension on subsequent trials, with no evidence for generalization. A new neural network model shows that our results can only be simulated when including multiple independent conflict-detector units.

    "abstract": "New drugs are needed to shorten and simplify treatment of tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Metabolic pathways that M. tuberculosis requires for growth or survival during infection represent potential targets for anti-tubercular drug development. Genes and metabolic pathways essential for M. tuberculosis growth in standard laboratory culture conditions have been defined by genome-wide genetic screens. However, whether M. tuberculosis requires these essential genes during infection has not been comprehensively explored because mutant strains cannot be generated using standard methods. Here we show that M. tuberculosis requires functional phenylalanine (Phe) and de novo purine and thiamine biosynthetic pathways for mammalian infection. We used a defined collection of M. tuberculosis transposon (Tn) mutants in essential genes, which we generated using a custom nutrient-rich medium, and transposon sequencing (Tn-seq) to identify multiple central metabolic pathways required for fitness in a mouse infection model. We confirmed by individual retesting and complementation that mutations in pheA (Phe biosynthesis) or purF (purine and thiamine biosynthesis) cause death of M. tuberculosis in the absence of nutrient supplementation in vitro and strong attenuation in infected mice. Our findings show that Tn-seq with defined Tn mutant pools can be used to identify M. tuberculosis genes required during mouse lung infection. Our results also demonstrate that M. tuberculosis requires Phe and purine/thiamine biosynthesis for survival in the host, implicating these metabolic pathways as prime targets for the development of new antibiotics to combat tuberculosis.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYMycobacterium tuberculosis causes more than 10 million new cases of active tuberculosis (TB) disease and 1.6 million deaths worldwide each year. Individuals with active TB must take a combination of four antibiotics for a minimum of 6-9 months to cure the infection. New anti-tubercular drugs are needed to simplify TB treatment and combat drug resistance. Here, we describe a novel collection of M. tuberculosis mutants lacking metabolic pathways essential for growth in standard laboratory conditions. Using these mutants, a mouse infection model, and deep sequencing we identified those metabolic pathways that M. tuberculosis also requires during infection. We find that M. tuberculosis mutants that cannot synthesize purine nucleotides, riboflavin, or certain amino acids are unable to grow in mice. We also find that mutant strains which cannot synthesize purine nucleotides or the amino acid phenylalanine die rapidly in laboratory cultures without nutrient supplementation, suggesting that new drugs targeting these pathways would kill M. tuberculosis. Overall, our work reveals multiple metabolic pathways that M. tuberculosis requires during infection, which could be pursued as new targets for development of anti-tubercular drugs.",

    "abstract": "We have recently identified a novel virus detected in alfalfa seed material. The virus was tentatively named alfalfa-associated potyvirus 1, as its genomic fragments bore similarities with potyvirids. In this study, we obtained a complete genome sequence of the virus and classified it as a tentative species in the new genus, most closely related to the members of the genus Ipomovirus in the family Potyviridae. This assumption is based on the genome structure, phylogenetic relationships, transmission electron microscopy investigations and, in part, on serological cross-reactivity of the virus. We also demonstrated its mechanical transmission to the indicator plant Nicotiana benthamiana and to the natural host Medicago sativa, both of which developed characteristic symptoms therefore suggesting a pathogenic nature of the disease. Consistent with symptomatology, the virus was renamed to alfalfa vein mottling virus. A name Alvemovirus was proposed for the new genus in the family Potyviridae, of which alfalfa vein mottling virus is a tentative member.",

    "abstract": "Genetic factors have involved the gradual emergence of cortical areas since the neural tube begins to form, shaping the specialization of neural circuits in the human brain. Informed by invasive tract-tracing measurements, the cortex exhibits marked interareal variation in connectivity profiles, yet how this spatial variation is encoded in genetics remains unclear. Instead of considering a complex one-to-one mapping between genetic coding and interareal connectivity variation, we hypothesized the existence of a more efficient way that the organizing principles are embedded in genetic profiles to underpin the configuration of connectivity across the human cortex. Specifically, we found that a noninvasive neuroimaging measure, i.e., global connectopy derived from diffusion-weighted MRI tractography, reliably indexes the organizing principles of interareal connectivity variation, and it captures three dominant topographic patterns along the dorsoventral, rostrocaudal, and mediolateral axes of the cortex. We further found that the global connectopies converge to the gradients of vertex-by-vertex genetic correlation matrix on the phenotype of cortical morphology and the cortex-wide spatiomolecular gradients. Moreover, we found the critical role of genes related to brain morphogenesis in scaffolding the global connectopies. Our findings identify a common space linking genetic profilings and interareal connectivity variation, which may contribute to the accurate formation of cortical connections and arealization.",

    "abstract": "Research suggests that cerebral metabolic rates of glucose (CMRGLC) decline with age. However, only a small body of research has taken into account partial volume effects in PET imaging and age-related reductions in cortical thickness. Separate research suggests that levels of peripheral insulin resistance may be a biomarker for functional brain changes. Thirty-six younger (mean 27.8 years) and 43 older (mean 75.5) participants completed a blood and cognitive tests battery and a simultaneous 90-minute MR/PET scan. Cortical thickness and CMRGLC were derived using the Schaefer 100 atlas, and major subcortical structures. Insulin resistance was measured with the Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR). Older adults had lower CMRGLC than younger adults across most regions, an effect that was mediated in part but not in full by age-related lower cortical thickness. Age x HOMA-IR interaction analysis showed that a 10% increase in insulin resistance was associated with 2% to 8% lower CMRGLC in younger adults across regions, with smaller reductions in older adults. Higher CMRGLC in the ventral attention, control and default networks was associated with better executive function, attention and processing seed. These results suggest that the age-related cerebral metabolism reductions are partly mediated by cortical atrophy, whereas insulin resistance associations with CMRGLC are moderated by age.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus is involved in numerous cognitive functions, some of which have uniquely human aspects, such as autobiographical memory. Hippocampal anatomy, however, is typically considered conserved across primates and its evolutionary diversification is rarely studied. Comparing hippocampal structure and function is, therefore, critical for understanding human brain architecture. Here, we developed a novel comparative framework to study the hippocampus across species characterising its geometry, microstructure, and functional network embedding. In humans and macaques, we generated a new comparative space that represents the hippocampus as an unfolded surface, which respects its sheet-like anatomy. We mapped histological and MRI-derived markers of microstructure to the hippocampal surface and integrated it with low-dimensional embedding of resting-state MRI connectivity data. Our results demonstrate that the micro- and macro-structural organisation of the hippocampus are overall conserved in both species, showing consistent anterior-posterior and subfield-to-subfield differentiation. Furthermore, while hippocampal functional organisation also follows anterior-posterior trends in both species, hippocampal functional connectivity markedly reflected evolutionary reconfiguration of transmodal networks, in particular the default-mode network. Specifically, the inferior parietal lobe in the macaque mirrors an incomplete integration of the default mode network in non-human primates. By combining fine-grained anatomical investigation with large-scale functional imaging, we showed that microstructurally preserved regions like the hippocampus may still undergo functional reconfiguration, due to their embedding in higher-order association networks.\n\nSummaryWhile the hippocampus is key for uniquely human cognitive abilities, it is also a phylogenetically old cortex and paradoxically considered evolutionarily preserved. Here, we introduce a comparative framework to quantify preservation and reconfiguration of hippocampal organisation in primate evolution, by analysing the hippocampus as an unfolded cortical surface that is geometrically matched across species. Our findings revealed an overall conservation of hippocampal macro- and micro-structure, showing anterior-posterior and, perpendicularly, subfield-related organisational axes in both humans and macaques. However, while functional organisation in both species also followed an anterior-posterior axis, the latter showed a marked evolutionary reconfiguration, which mirrors a rudimentary integration of the default-mode-network in non-human primates. Our findings suggest that microstructurally preserved regions like the hippocampus may still undergo functional reconfiguration in primate evolution, due to their embedding in heteromodal association networks.",

    "abstract": "Exploration is a key part of an animals ability to learn. The exploration-exploitation dilemma predicts that individuals should adjust their exploration behaviour according to changes in the value of information. Here, we test this prediction by tracking ruby-throated hummingbirds as they foraged repeatedly from a large array of artificial flowers, wherein 25% of the flowers contained a sucrose reward. Similar to real-world floral dynamics, the reward locations were consistent in the short-term, but varied from day to day. Thus, the value of information about the flower contents would be greatest at the beginning of a daily foraging session, and decay toward the end of each session. We tracked five individual hummingbirds in repeated foraging sessions, comprising more than 3,400 floral probes. We analyzed two metrics of their exploration behaviour: (1) the probability that a bird would shift from probing one flower to another, and (2) the Shannon information entropy of a sequence of flowers probed. We show that initially, the hummingbirds increased their exploration behaviour as time elapsed within a session. As they performed more sessions and learned the rules of the environment, the hummingbirds switched to explore more diverse choices at the beginning of a foraging session, when the value of information was high, and less diverse choices toward the end of a session. Our results suggest that foraging hummingbirds can learn when to learn, highlighting the importance of plasticity in exploration behaviour.\n\nHighlightsO_LIExploration is a necessary part of learning\nC_LIO_LIForagers must balance sampling for information with the use of known rewards\nC_LIO_LIHummingbirds learned to explore more when the value of new information was high\nC_LIO_LIApparent mistakes may actually represent an information-seeking strategy\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Behavioural flexibility plays a major role in the way animals cope with novel situations, and physiological stress responses are adaptive and highly efficient mechanisms to cope with unpredictable events. Previous studies investigating the role of stress responses in mediating behavioural flexibility were mostly done in laboratory rodents using stressors and cognitive challenges unrelated to the ecology of the species. To better understand how stress mediates behavioural flexibility in a natural context, direct manipulation of the stress response and cognitive tests in ecologically relevant contexts are needed. To this aim, we pharmacologically blocked glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in adult cichlid fish using a minimally invasive application of a GR antagonist. GRs blockade prevents the termination of the stress response, which we predicted to impair behavioural flexibility. After the application of the GR antagonist, we repeatedly exposed fish to a predator and tested their behavioural flexibility using a detour task, i.e. fish had to find a new, longer route to the shelter when the shortest route was blocked. While the latencies to find the shelter were not different between treatments, GR blocked fish showed more failed attempts during the detour tasks than control fish. Furthermore, reduced performance was accompanied by an increase of fear related behaviours. This suggests that blocking GRs plays an important role in determining perceived fear and resulted in an impaired behavioural flexibility. We confirm a causal role of terminating the stress response in mediating behavioural flexibility with potential consequences for an effective and adaptive coping with changing environments.",

    "abstract": "Humans spontaneously infer information about others to perceive the similarity in behaviors and traits among people in our social environments. However, evaluating the similarity among people can be achieved through multiple frames of reference: other-to-other differences (allocentric similarity) or self-to-other differences (egocentric similarity), which are difficult to dissociate with behavioral measures alone. Here, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging to test whether the similarity of brain response patterns when thinking of others and the self is predicted by models of allocentric and egocentric similarity in the trait-judgments of well-acquainted peers from 20 independent groups of people (total N = 108; within-subject design). Results show that both allocentric and egocentric similarity during person representation are reflected in brain response similarity patterns when thinking of others but do so differentially and in non-overlapping brain systems. Specifically, allocentric similarity was positively related to brain similarity patterns in distributed regions involved in social cognition as well as in regions involved in general non-social spatial reference frame encoding. Egocentric similarity was inversely related to brain response similarity but only within dorsal regions of the medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate, suggesting that activation within this region is important for dissociating self-representation from that of similar others. These results suggest that the brain processes both kinds of reference frames independently to encode trait information about conspecifics that we use to represent person knowledge about other people within real-world social networks.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe nucleus incertus (NI) was originally described by Streeter in 1903, as a midline region in the floor of the fourth ventricle (4V) of the human brain with an  unknown function. More than a century later, the neuroanatomy of the NI including its forebrain target regions has been described in lower vertebrates, but not in humans. Therefore, we examined the neurochemical anatomy of the human NI using several markers, including the neuropeptide, relaxin-3 (RLN3), and began to explore the distribution of the NI-related RLN3 innervation of the hippocampus.\n\nMethodsHistochemical staining of serial, coronal sections (30 {micro}m) of control human postmortem pons was conducted to reveal the presence of the NI by detection of immunoreactivity (IR) for the neuronal marker, microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP2), two markers present in rat NI, glutamic acid dehydrogenase (GAD)-65/67 and corticotrophin releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1), and RLN3, which is highly expressed in a major population of NI neurons in diverse species. RLN3 and vesicular GABA transporter 1 (vGAT1) mRNA was detected by multiplex, fluorescence in situ hybridization. Postmortem pons sections containing the NI from an Alzheimers disease (AD) case were immunostained for phosphorylated-tau (AT8 antibody), to explore potential relevance to neurodegenerative diseases. Lastly, sections of human hippocampus were stained to detect RLN3-IR and somatostatin (SST)-IR, as SST is expressed in interneurons targeted by RLN3 projections in rodents.\n\nResultsIn the dorsal, anterior-medial region of the human pons, neurons containing RLN3- and MAP2-IR, and RLN3/vGAT1 mRNA-positive neurons were observed in an anatomical pattern consistent with that of the NI in other species. GAD65/67- and CRHR1-immunopositive neurons were also detected within this area. Furthermore, RLN3- and AT8-IR were co-localized within NI neurons of an AD subject. Lastly, RLN3-IR was detected in neurons within the CA1, CA2, CA3, and DG areas of the hippocampus, in the absence of RLN3 mRNA. In the DG, RLN3- and SST-IR were co-localized in a small population of neurons.\n\nConclusionsAspects of the anatomy of the human NI are shared across species, including a population of RLN3-expressing neurons and a RLN3 innervation of the hippocampus. Accumulation of phosphorylated-tau in the NI suggests its possible involvement in AD pathology. Further characterization of the neurochemistry of the human NI will increase our understanding of its functional role in health and disease.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=75 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/556922v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (24K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f4c439org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17e85f5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18ca7faorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@168246c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical Abstract\n\nCreated with BioRender.com\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "The heterogeneity of the physical environment determines the cost of transport for animals, shaping their energy landscape. Animals respond to this energy landscape by adjusting their distribution and movement to maximize gains and reduce movement costs. Much of our current knowledge about energy landscape dynamics focuses on factors external to the animal, particularly the spatio-temporal variations of the environment. However, an animals internal state can significantly impact its ability to perceive and utilize the available energy within the landscape, giving rise to an \"individual energy landscape\". Here we show that an individuals energy landscape varies along the ontogenetic axis. Locomotor and cognitive capabilities of individuals change over time, especially during the early life stages. We investigate the development of the energy landscape during ontogeny in the Central European alpine population of the golden eagle Aquila chrysaetos, a large predator that requires negotiating the physical environment to achieve energy-efficient soaring flight. We constructed weekly energy landscapes using environmental features for 55 juvenile golden eagles and demonstrate that energetic costs of traversing the landscape decreased as the birds aged. In fact, the potentially flyable area within the Alpine region increased 2,170-fold during their first three years of independence. Our work contributes to achieving a predictive understanding of animal movement behaviors by presenting ontogeny as a mechanism shaping the individual energy landscape.\n\nSignificance statementAnimals strategically negotiate their environment, making decisions about when and where to move to minimize costs. The energy landscape framework has provided the opportunity to predict the energetic costs of movement based on environmental conditions. However, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the dimensions along which the energy landscape changes. Using bio-logging data for 55 juvenile golden eagles tracked for up to three years after independence, we reveal that as young animals develop their movement skills, their landscape becomes cheaper to traverse. These findings suggest that the developmental stage impacts animals ability to perceive and exploit the energy available in the landscape. This adds ontogeny as a new dimension to our predictive understanding of animal movement behaviors.",

What semantic properties support this individualized experience of natural language? Here, we investigate how the \"concreteness\" of word meanings -- i.e., the extent to which a concept is derived from sensory experience -- relates to variability in the neural representations of language. Leveraging a large dataset of participants who each listened to four auditory stories while undergoing functional MRI, we demonstrate that an individuals neural representations of concrete concepts are reliable across stories and unique to the individual. In contrast, we find that neural representations of abstract concepts are variable both within individuals and across the population. Using natural language processing tools, we show that concrete words exhibit similar neural signatures despite spanning larger distances within a high-dimensional semantic space, which potentially reflects an underlying signature of sensory experience -- namely, imageability -- shared by concrete words but absent from abstract words. Our findings situate the concrete-abstract semantic axis as a core dimension that supports reliable yet individualized representations of natural language.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in addition to neuroinflammation and changes in brain lipid metabolism. Recent findings have demonstrated that microglia are key drivers of neurodegeneration in tauopathy mouse models. A subset of microglia referred to as disease-associated microglia (DAM) display gene signatures signifying changes in proinflammatory signaling and lipid metabolism in mouse models of amyloid and tau pathology. Ch25h is a DAM gene encoding cholesterol 25-hydroxylase that produces 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), a known modulator of inflammation as well as lipid metabolism. However, whether Ch25h influences tau-mediated neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration is unknown. Here, we show that in the absence of Ch25h and the resultant reduction in 25HC there is strikingly reduced age-dependent neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in the hippocampus and entorhinal/piriform cortex of PS19 mice, which express the P301S mutant human tau transgene. Transcriptomic analyses of bulk hippocampal tissue and single nuclei revealed that Ch25h deficiency in PS19 mice strongly suppressed proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine signaling in microglia and restored sterol synthesis. Our results suggest a key role for Ch25h/25HC in potentiating proinflammatory signaling to promote tau-mediated neurodegeneration. Ch25h may represent a novel therapeutic target for primary tauopathies, AD, and other neuroinflammatory diseases.",

    "abstract": "Sleep has been shown to impact navigation ability. However, it remains unclear how different sleep-related variables may be independently associated with spatial navigation performance, and as to whether gender may play a role in these associations. We used a mobile video game app, Sea Hero Quest (SHQ), to measure wayfinding ability in US-based participants. Wayfinding performance on SHQ has been shown to correlate with real-world wayfinding. Participants were asked to report their sleep duration, quality, daytime sleepiness and nap frequency and duration (n = 737, 409 men, 328 women, mean age = 27.1 years, range = 18-59 years). A multivariate linear regression was used to identify which sleep variables were independently associated with wayfinding performance. For men, longer sleep durations were associated with better wayfinding performance. For women, no such association was found. While other sleep variables showed trends of association with wayfinding performance, none of these were significantly associated with wayfinding performance in our regression model. These findings from younger U.S.-based participants suggest that a longer sleep duration may be an important contributor to successful navigation ability in men.",

    "abstract": "Various techniques, including optogenetics, chemogenetics, electrical stimulation, and lesions are used to probe brain function and dysfunction. However, the mechanistic consequences of such manipulations at the whole-brain scale remain poorly understood. This information is necessary for a proper interpretation of the functional consequences of local alterations. Combining mouse experimental datasets of focal interventions (thalamic lesion and chemogenetic silencing of cortical hubs), we demonstrate both local and global effects. Utilizing advanced whole-brain simulations of experimental data, we not only confirm the distributed nature of local manipulations but also offer mechanistic insights into these processes. Our simulations predict that the reconfiguration of hemodynamic functional connectivity is tightly coupled with the modulation of neurophysiological activity. This includes alterations in firing rates and spectral characteristics across specific brain networks, leading to structured changes in functional connectivity patterns. Crucially, the brain subnetworks most profoundly impacted are contingent upon the precise site of local intervention. Thus, these subnetworks serve as distinctive fingerprints, enabling pinpoint localization of the altered brain region. This knowledge holds the potential to inform clinical decision-making and address focal brain pathologies by developing circuit-level interventions and customized neuromodulation therapies.",

    "abstract": "Music has profoundly shaped the human experience across diverse cultures and generations, yet the mechanisms that it influences our minds and bodies remain elusive. This study examined how the perception of music chords elicits bodily sensations and emotions through predictive processing of the brain. By deploying body-mapping tests and emotional evaluations on 527 participants exposed to chord progressions, we unveil the intricate interplay between musical uncertainty, prediction error, and temporal dynamics in eliciting specific bodily sensations and emotions. Our results demonstrated that the chord progressions characterized by low uncertainty coupled with high surprise or predictability evoke bodily sensations closely associated with interoception including the cardiac and abdominal regions. Notably, these sensations are associated with aesthetic appreciation, with the intensity of cardiac sensations being positively correlated with valence in chord progressions with low uncertainty and high surprise. These results highlight the pivotal role of uncertainty and prediction error in shaping emotional responses and also suggest a hypothesis for emotion generation through predictive processing and sound embodiment. This study offers a tantalizing glimpse into the potential nexus between interoception by music and mental well-being, underscoring the importance of recognizing diverse forms of musical pleasure and their unique effects on our minds and bodies.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease is characterized pathologically by cerebral deposition of 42-residue amyloid {beta}-peptide (A{beta}42), proteolytically produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by {beta}- and {gamma}-secretases.1 Although mutations in APP and presenilin, the catalytic component of {gamma}-secretase, cause familial Alzheimers disease (FAD), a role for A{beta}42 as the primary disease driver has not been clearly established and remains controversial.2,3 Here we show through comprehensive analysis of the multi-step proteolysis of APP substrate C99 by {gamma}-secretase that FAD mutations are consistently deficient in early proteolytic events, not later events that produce secreted A{beta} peptides. Cryo-electron microscopy revealed that a substrate mimetic traps {gamma}-secretase at the transition state for intramembrane proteolysis, and this structure closely aligns with activated enzyme-substrate complex captured by molecular dynamics simulations. In silico simulations and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy in cultured cells support stabilization by FAD mutations of enzyme-substrate and/or enzyme-intermediate complexes. Neuronal expression of C99 and/or presenilin-1 in Caenorabditis elegans led to age-dependent synaptic loss only when one of the transgenes carried an FAD mutation. Designed mutations that stabilize the enzyme-substrate complex and block proteolysis likewise led to synaptic loss. Collectively, these findings implicate the stalled process--not the released products--of {gamma}-secretase cleavage of substrates in FAD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The dorsal and ventral regions of the hippocampus (dCA1 and vCA1) are critical for contextual fear conditioning tasks, yet the dynamics of hippocampal neuronal representations during memory acquisition, retrieval, and extinction processes have yet to be fully elucidated. The canonical theory is that the hippocampus generates and retrieves spatial maps of contexts during memory acquisition and retrieval. It is hypothesized the hippocampus prevents memory interference by generating context representations that are dissimilar and the prediction follows that representation dissimilarity facilitates discrimination between contexts. Here, we developed a context fear memory retrieval task and combined it with 1-photon neuronal imaging in dCA1 and vCA1 of freely behaving mice to test this prediction. We identified several phenomena specific to vCA1. First, fear conditioning induced an immediate and strong representational change that was predictive of freezing behavior. During context discrimination, vCA1 representations of the threatening and neutral contexts became more similar. Third, during threatening context memory retrieval, vCA1 expressed rapid and strong context representations. These unexpected results suggest that representational similarity in vCA1 facilitates faster and more efficient network state transitions. In further support of this view, both phenomena of representational similarity and rapid context recall were no longer observed in vCA1 once fear behavior was extinguished. Together, these results reveal that vCA1 unexpectedly generates similar population codes, promoting faster transitions between network states essential for contextual fear memory retrieval.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe established a novel context teleportation task that allows population level hippocampal recordings during key moments of threat memory acquisition, retrieval, and extinction.\nC_LIO_LIThe ventral region of CA1 (vCA1) exhibited the greatest change in neural representation during fear memory acquisition, compared to dorsal CA1 (dCA1).\nC_LIO_LIAfter fear conditioning, representations for threatening and neutral contexts were more similar in vCA1 compared to dCA1, yet representational similarity in vCA1 supported rapid context memory retrieval.\nC_LIO_LIContext fear memory extinction reversed the context representation in vCA1 to patterns observed prior to fear conditioning.\nC_LI\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=198 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/556889v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (104K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dd5ba2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ab16c5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1640a6dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e87cde_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Reductions in the ability to encode and retrieve past experiences in rich spatial contextual detail (episodic memory) are apparent by midlife - a time when most females experience spontaneous (natural) menopause. Yet, little is known about how menopause status and chronological aging influence the functional brain networks associated with episodic memory. Female-specific investigations of memory-related brain function at midlife are thus warranted to advance our knowledge of how menopause and chronological aging affect cognitive brain aging in middle-aged females. We conducted an event-related task fMRI study of episodic memory for spatial context and used multivariate partial least squares (PLS) to investigate how chronological age and retrieval accuracy correlated with brain activity in 31 middle-aged premenopausal (age range: 39.55 - 53.30 yrs, Mage = 44.41 yrs, SDage = 3.12 yrs) and 41 middle-aged postmenopausal females (age range: 46.70 to 65.14 yrs, Mage = 57.05 yrs, SDage = 3.93 yrs). Behaviorally, both advanced age and postmenopausal status contributed to lower spatial context memory. PLS analysis of the fMRI data indicated that premenopausal, but not postmenopausal, females exhibited a positive correlation between lateral PFC, midline cortical, and angular gyrus activity during retrieval and spatial context memory performance. Also, only postmenopausal females advanced age was correlated with decreased activity in occipitotemporal, parahippocampal, and inferior parietal during encoding and retrieval and poorer spatial context memory performance. Our results highlight that both menopause and chronological aging affect episodic memory and related brain function in middle-aged females.\n\nSignificance StatementThis study advances our understanding of how menopause status and chronological age affect memory-related brain function in middle-aged females. Using data driven multivariate partial least squares (PLS) regression for behavioral analysis and PLS correlation for fMRI analysis we found: 1) advanced age and post-menopause status negatively affected spatial context memory, 2) Only premenopausal females exhibited overlap in encoding and retrieval activity in angular gyrus, midline cortical regions, and prefrontal cortex, which correlated with better spatial context retrieval accuracy, and 3) age was correlated with reduced encoding and retrieval activity in occipitotemporal, parahippocampal, inferior parietal in only post-menopause, and this was associated with poorer spatial context memory.",

    "abstract": "Neural population activity in sensory cortex informs our perceptual interpretation of the environment. Oftentimes, this population activity will support multiple alternative interpretations. The larger the set of plausible alternatives, the more uncertain the selected perceptual interpretation. We test the hypothesis that the reliability of perceptual interpretations can be revealed through simple transformations of sensory population activity. We recorded V1 population activity in fixating macaques while presenting oriented stimuli under different levels of nuisance variability and signal strength. We developed a decoding procedure to infer from V1 activity the most likely stimulus orientation as well as the certainty of this estimate. Our analysis shows that response magnitude, response dispersion, and variability in response gain all offer useful proxies for orientation certainty. Of these three metrics, the last one has the strongest association with the decoders uncertainty estimates. These results clarify that the nature of neural population activity in sensory cortex provides downstream circuits with multiple options to assess the reliability of perceptual interpretations.",

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by the functional loss of Fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP), a translational regulator that binds the transcripts of many proteins involved in synaptic function and plasticity. Dysregulated protein synthesis is a central effect of FMRP loss and to date direct translational modulation has not been leveraged in the treatment of FXS. Thus, we examined the effect of the small molecule translational modulator, Integrated Stress Response Inhibitor (ISRIB), in treating synaptic and behavioral symptoms of FXS. Using a combination of population-level single synapse analysis, in vivo two-photon microscopy, and behavioral analysis, we revealed a mechanism for the appearance of dense and immature dendritic spines, which are observed in human FXS patients and Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice. Our data suggest that FMRP loss at the synapse dysregulates synaptic protein abundance and that spines are disproportionately stabilized through increased PSD-95 expression but prevented from maturing through reduced synaptic accumulation of glutamate receptors. ISRIB rescues these molecular and synaptic deficits in FXS and improves social recognition in Fmr1 KO mice. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting core translational mechanisms and the differential impact of FMRP on synaptic and cellular function in FXS and neurodevelopmental disorders more broadly.",

It has become critical to understand its basic pharmacology, how it impacts behavior, and how it interacts with fentanyl in rodent models of opioid administration. Despite commentary from scientists, politicians, and public health officials, it is not known if xylazine impacts the efficacy of naloxone, the opioid receptor antagonist used to reverse opioid induced respiratory depression. Furthermore, few studies have examined the effects of xylazine alone, without co-administration of ketamine. Here, we examine the impact of xylazine alone and in combination with fentanyl on several key behaviors in male and female mice. We demonstrate differential locomotor responses by dose and sex to xylazine. Surprisingly, our results further indicate that naloxone precipitates withdrawal from xylazine and a fentanyl/xylazine combination, in both sexes, with enhanced sensitivity in females. Further, we show that xylazine is a full agonist at the kappa opioid receptor, a potential mechanism for its naloxone sensitivity.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryWe present surprising new insights into xylazine and fentanyl pharmacology with immediate implications for clinical practice and frontline public health.",

Moreover, the seed-amplification assay (SAA) by the ultrasensitive real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) displayed that the prion-like seeding activity of pathological tau in the skin of cadavers with neuropathologically confirmed tauopathies including AD, PSP, CBD, PiD was dramatically higher than that in normal controls, yielding 75-80% sensitivity and 95-100% specificity, respectively, depending on different tau substrates used. The increased tau-seeding activity was also observed in biopsy skin samples from living AD and PSP patients. Moreover, analysis of the end products of skin-tau SAA confirmed that the increased seeding activity is accompanied with formation of tau aggregates that are of different physicochemical properties determined by the different tau-substrates used. Our study provides proof-of-concept that the skin tau-SAA can differentiate tauopathies from normal controls, suggesting that the seeding activity of the skin misfolded tau can serve as an accurate diagnostic biomarker of tauopathies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAdult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP) is a primary microgliopathy caused by pathogenic variants in the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) gene. Since CSF1R signaling is crucial for microglia development, survival and function, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia (iMGL) represent an excellent tool in studying microglial defects caused by ALSP patient-specific CSF1R variants.\n\nMethodsSerial modifications to an existing iMGL protocol were made, including but not limited to changes in growth factor combination to drive microglial differentiation, until successful derivation of microglia-like cells from an ALSP patient carrying a c.2350G > A (p.V784M) CSF1R variant. Using healthy control lines, the quality of the new iMGL protocol was validated through cell yield assessment, measurement of microglia marker expression, transcriptomic comparison to primary microglia, and evaluation of inflammatory and phagocytic activities. Similarly, molecular and functional characterization of the ALSP patient-derived iMGL was carried out in comparison to healthy control iMGL.\n\nResultsThe newly devised protocol allowed the generation of iMGL with enhanced transcriptomic similarity to primary human microglia and with higher phagocytic and inflammatory competence at [~]3-fold greater yield compared to the original protocol. Using this protocol, decreased CSF1R autophosphorylation and cell surface expression was observed in iMGL derived from the ALSP patient compared to those derived from healthy controls. Additionally, ALSP patient-derived iMGL presented a migratory defect accompanying a temporal reduction in purinergic receptor P2Y12 (P2RY12) expression. Finally, ALSP patient-derived cells showed surprisingly high phagocytic capacity, which was associated with higher lysosomal content.\n\nConclusionsWe optimized a pre-existing iMGL protocol, generating a powerful tool to study microglial involvement in human neurological diseases. Using the optimized protocol, we have generated for the first time iMGL from an ALSP patient carrying a pathogenic CSF1R variant, with preliminary characterization pointing toward functional alterations in migratory and phagocytic activities.",

    "abstract": "Sound elicits rapid movements of muscles in the face, ears, and eyes that protect the body from injury and trigger brain-wide internal state changes. Here, we performed quantitative facial videography from mice resting atop a piezoelectric force plate and observed that broadband sounds elicit rapid, small, and highly stereotyped movements of a facial region near the vibrissae array. Facial motion energy (FME) analysis revealed sensitivity to far lower sound levels than the acoustic startle reflex and greater reliability across trials and mice than sound-evoked pupil dilations or movement of other facial and body regions. FME tracked the low-frequency envelope of sounds and could even decode speech phonemes in varying levels of background noise with high accuracy. FME growth slopes were disproportionately steep in mice with autism risk gene mutations and noise-induced sensorineural hearing loss, providing an objective behavioral measure of sensory hyper-responsivity. Increased FME after noise-induced cochlear injury was closely associated with the emergence of excess gain in later waves of the auditory brainstem response, suggesting a midbrain contribution. Deep layer auditory cortex units were entrained to spontaneous facial movements but optogenetic suppression of cortical activity facilitated - not suppressed - sound-evoked FME, suggesting the auditory cortex is a modulator rather than a mediator of sound-evoked facial movements. These findings highlight a simple involuntary behavior that is more sensitive and integrative than other auditory reflex pathways and captures higher-order changes in sound processing from mice with inherited and acquired hearing disorders.",

    "abstract": "The fMRI blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal is a mainstay of neuroimaging assessment of neuronal activity and functional connectivity in vivo. Thus, a chief priority is maximizing this signals reliability and validity. To this end, the fMRI community has invested considerable effort into optimizing both experimental designs and physiological denoising procedures to improve the accuracy, across-scan reproducibility, and subject discriminability of BOLD-derived metrics like functional connectivity. Despite these advances, we discover that a substantial and ubiquitous defect remains in fMRI datasets: functional connectivity throughout the brain artifactually inflates during the course of fMRI scans - by an average of more than 70% in 15 minutes of scan time - at spatially heterogeneous rates, producing both spatial and temporal distortion of brain connectivity maps. We provide evidence that this inflation is driven by a previously unrecognized time-dependent increase of non-neuronal, systemic low-frequency oscillation (sLFO) blood flow signal during fMRI scanning. This signal is not removed by standard denoising procedures such as independent component analysis (ICA). However, we demonstrate that a specialized sLFO denoising procedure - Regressor Interpolation at Progressive Time Delays (RIPTiDe) - can be added to standard denoising pipelines to significantly attenuate functional connectivity inflation. We confirm the presence of sLFO-driven functional connectivity inflation in multiple independent fMRI datasets - including the Human Connectome Project - as well as across resting-state, task, and sleep-state conditions, and demonstrate its potential to produce false positive findings. Collectively, we present evidence for a previously unknown physiological phenomenon that spatiotemporally distorts estimates of brain connectivity in human fMRI datasets, and present a solution for mitigating this artifact.",

    "abstract": "Face processing is fundamental to primates and has been extensively studied in higher-order visual cortex. Here we report that visual neurons in the midbrain superior colliculus (SC) display a preference for faces, that the preference emerges within 50ms of stimulus onset - well before \"face patches\" in visual cortex - and that this activity can distinguish faces from other visual objects with accuracies of [~]80%. This short-latency preference in SC depends on signals routed through early visual cortex, because inactivating the lateral geniculate nucleus, the key relay from retina to cortex, virtually eliminates visual responses in SC, including face-related activity. These results reveal an unexpected circuit in the primate visual system for rapidly detecting faces in the periphery, complementing the higher-order areas needed for recognizing individual faces.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryAn unexpected circuit through the primate midbrain reports the presence of a face in peripheral vision in 1/20th of a second.",

    "abstract": "Following an ischemic insult to the brain, there is an acute loss of GABAergic inhibitory synapses and an increase in excitatory/ inhibitory (E/I) imbalance that drives neuronal hyperexcitability. It is unknown whether this E/I imbalance persists at delayed timepoints and contributes to chronic impairments in memory and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus following ischemic brain injury. Here, we reveal a shift to reduced E/I ratio in hippocampal CA1 neurons via a persistent increase in postsynaptic GABAA receptor mediated inhibitory responses and clustering days after a global ischemic insult. This enhancement of postsynaptic inhibitory function and clustering required activation of the Ca2+-permeable TRPM2 ion channel and the Ca2+-dependent kinase, CaMKII. Thus, we propose a mechanism in which acute downregulation of GABAA receptors is followed by a strengthening of inhibitory synapses at delayed periods after ischemia. Targeting this mechanism has therapeutic potential to recover hippocampal plasticity and cognitive function post-ischemia.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=123 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/556550v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16ef5f2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d51f19org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ecc726org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@106cdd0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Cortical excitability measures neural reactivity to stimuli, usually delivered via Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). Excitation/inhibition balance (E/I) is the ongoing equilibrium between excitatory and inhibitory activity of neural circuits. According to some studies, E/I could be estimated in-vivo and non-invasively through the modeling of electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Several measures have been proposed (phase consistency in the gamma band, sample entropy, exponent of the power spectral density 1/f curve, E/I index extracted from detrend fluctuation analysis, and alpha power). It remains to be investigated to what extent they scale with excitability and how they relate to each other. Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) of the primary motor cortex (M1) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique allowing controlled and focal enhancement of cortical excitability and E/I of the stimulated hemisphere. M1 excitability and several E/I estimates extracted from resting state EEG recordings were assessed before and after iTBS in a cohort of healthy subjects. Enhancement of M1 excitability, as measured through motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), and phase consistency of the cortex in high gamma band correlated with each other. Other measures of E/I showed some expected results, but no correlation with TMS excitability measures or consistency with each other. EEG E/I estimates offer an intriguing opportunity to map cortical excitability non-invasively, with high spatio-temporal resolution and with a stimulus independent approach. While different EEG E/I estimates may reflect the activity of diverse excitatory-inhibitory circuits, spatial phase synchrony in the gamma band is the measure that best captures excitability changes in the primary motor cortex.",

    "abstract": "Our visual world consists of an immense number of unique objects and yet, we are easily able to identify, distinguish, interact, and reason about the things we see within several hundred milliseconds. This requires that we flexibly integrate and focus on different object properties to support specific behavioral goals. In the current study, we examined how these rich object representations unfold in the human brain by modelling time-resolved MEG signals evoked by viewing thousands of objects. Using millions of behavioral judgments to guide our understanding of the neural representation of the object space, we find distinct temporal profiles across the object dimensions. These profiles fell into two broad types with either a distinct and early peak ([~]150 ms) or a slow rise to a late peak ([~]300 ms). Further, the early effects are stable across participants in contrast to later effects which show more variability across people. This highlights that early peaks may carry stimulus-specific and later peaks subject-specific information. Given that the dimensions with early peaks seem to be primarily visual dimensions and those with later peaks more conceptual, our results suggest that conceptual processing is more variable across people. Together, these data provide a comprehensive account of how a variety of object properties unfold in the human brain and contribute to the rich nature of object vision.",

Differences in hardware and acquisition result in data that contains site dependent information, which confounds connectome analyses aiming to combine such multi-site data. We propose a data-driven solution that isolates site-invariant information whilst maintaining relevant features of the connectome. We construct a latent space that is uncorrelated with the imaging site and highly correlated with patient age and a connectome summary measure. Here, we focus on network modularity. The proposed model is a conditional, variational autoencoder with three additional prediction tasks: one for patient age, and two for modularity trained exclusively on data from each site. This model enables us to 1) isolate site-invariant biological features, learn site context, and 3) re-inject site context and project biological features to desired site domains. We tested these hypotheses by projecting 77 connectomes from two studies and protocols (Vanderbilt Memory and Aging Project (VMAP) and Biomarkers of Cognitive Decline Among Normal Individuals (BIOCARD) to a common site. We find that the resulting dataset of modularity has statistically similar means (p-value <0.05) across sites. In addition, we fit a linear model to the joint dataset and find that positive correlations between age and modularity were preserved.",

    "abstract": "Face masks became a part of everyday life in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Previous studies showed that the face cognition mechanism involves holistic face processing, and the absence of face features could lower cognition ability. This is opposed to the experience during the pandemic, when people were able to correctly recognize faces, although the mask covered a part of the face. This paper shows a strong correlation in face cognition based on the EEG and eye-tracking data between the full and partial faces. We observed two event-related potentials, P3a in the frontal lobe and P3b in the parietal lobe, as subcomponents of P300. Both P3a and P3b were lowered when the eyes were invisible, and P3a evoked by the nose covered was larger than the full face. The eye-tracking data showed that 16 out of 18 participants focused on the eyes associated with the EEG results. Our results demonstrate that the eyes are the most crucial feature of facial cognition. Moreover, the face with the nose covered might enhance cognition ability due to the visual working memory capacity. Our experiment shows the possibility of people recognizing faces using both holistic face processing and structural face processing. Furthermore, people can recognize the masked face as well as the full face in similar cognition patterns due to the high correlation in the cognition mechanism.",

The slope of age-related GABA differences in cognitively-intact oldest-old adults flattens after roughly age 80. We interpret these findings as an effect of survivorship: inclusion in the study required intact cognition, and too great a reduction of GABA levels may not be compatible with neurophysiological function needed for intact cognition.

This analysis revealed a previously unrecognized CLDN10+ amnion progenitor cell type and enabled the identification of several markers specific to the different stages of lineage progression. Strikingly, we found that expression of CLDN10 is restricted to the amnion-epiblast boundary region in peri-gastrula cynomolgus macaque embryos, bolstering the notion that, at this stage, the amnion-epiblast boundary is a site of active amniogenesis. Bioinformatic analysis of published primate peri-gastrula single cell sequencing data further confirmed that CLDN10 is expressed in cells progressing to amnion. Overall, this study identifies a previously unrecognized CLDN10+ amnion progenitor-like cell population and validates the presence of these fate transitioning cells at the boundary of the developing amnion.",

    "abstract": "The tunicates form a group of filter-feeding marine animals closely related to vertebrates. They share with them a number of features such as a notochord and a dorsal neural tube in the tadpole larvae of ascidians, one of the three groups that make tunicates. However, a number of typical chordate characters have been lost in different branches of tunicates, a diverse and fast-evolving phylum. Consequently, the tunic, a sort of exoskeleton made of extracellular material including cellulose secreted by the epidermis, is the unifying character defining the tunicate phylum. In the larva of ascidians, the tunic differenBates in the tail into a median fin (with dorsal and ventral extended blades) and a caudal fin. Here we have performed experiments in the ascidian Phallusia mammillata to address the molecular control of tunic 3D morphogenesis. We have demonstrated that the tail epidermis medio-lateral paaerning essenBal for peripheral nervous system specificaBon also controls tunic elongaBon into fins. More specifically, when tail epidermis midline idenBty was abolished by BMP signaling inhibiBon, or CRISPR/Cas9 inacBvaBon of the transcripBon factor coding genes Msx or Klf1/2/4/17, median fin did not form. We postulated that this geneBc program should regulate effectors of tunic secreBon. We thus analyzed the expression and regulaBon in different ascidian species of two genes acquired by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from bacteria, CesA coding for a cellulose synthase and Gh6 coding for a cellulase. Although we have uncovered an unexpected dynamic history of these genes in tunicates, and high levels of variability in gene expression and regulaBon among ascidians, we showed that Gh6 has a regionalized expression in the epidermis, and that it is a regulator of caudal fin formaBon. Our study consBtutes an important step in the study of the integraBon of HGT-acquired genes into developmental networks, and a cellulose-based morphogenesis of extracellular material in animals.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWWhen humans perform repetitive tasks over long periods, their performance is not constant. People may drift in and out of states that might be loosely categorised as engagement, disengagement or  flow and these will be reflected in multiple aspects of their performance (for example, reaction time, accuracy, criteria shifts and potentially longer-term strategy) but until recently it has been challenging to relate these behavioural states to the underlying neural mechanisms that generate them. Here, we took Magnetoencephalograpy recordings of participants performing an engaging task that required rapid, strategic behavioural responses. In this way we acquired both high density neural data and contemporaneous, dense behavioural data. Specifically, participants played a laboratory version of Tetris which collects detailed recordings of player input and game-state throughout performance. We asked whether it was possible to infer the presence of distinct behavioural states from the behavioural data and, if so, whether these states would have distinct neural correlates. We used hidden Markov modelling to segment the behavioural time series into states with unique behavioural signatures, finding that we could identify three distinct and robust behavioural states. We then computed occipital alpha power across each state. These within-participant differences in alpha power were statistically significant, suggesting that individuals shift between behaviourally and neurally distinct states during complex performance, and that visuo-spatial attention change across these states.",

    "abstract": "The ability to act voluntarily is fundamental to animal behavior1,2,3,4,5. For example, self-directed movements are critical to exploration, particularly in the absence of external sensory signals that could shape a trajectory. However, how neural networks might plan future changes in direction in the absence of salient sensory cues is unknown. Here we use volumetric two-photon imaging to map neural activity associated with walking across the entire brain of the fruit fly Drosophila, register these signals across animals with micron precision, and generate a dataset of [~]20 billion neural measurements across thousands of bouts of voluntary movements. We define spatially clustered neural signals selectively associated with changes in forward and angular velocity, and reveal that turning is associated with widespread asymmetric activity between brain hemispheres. Strikingly, this asymmetry in interhemispheric dynamics emerges more than 10 seconds before a turn within a specific brain region associated with motor control, the Inferior Posterior Slope (IPS). This early, local difference in neural activity predicts the direction of future turns on a trial-by-trial basis, revealing long-term motor planning. As the direction of each turn is neither trained, nor guided by external sensory cues, it must be internally determined. We therefore propose that this pre-motor center contains a neural substrate of volitional action.",

    "abstract": "White matter signals in resting state blood oxygen level dependent functional magnetic resonance (BOLD-fMRI) have been largely discounted, yet there is growing evidence that these signals are indicative of brain activity. Understanding how these white matter signals capture function can provide insight into brain physiology. Moreover, functional signals could potentially be used as early markers for neurological changes, such as in Alzheimers Disease. To investigate white matter brain networks, we leveraged the OASIS-3 dataset to extract white matter signals from resting state BOLD-FMRI data on 711 subjects. The imaging was longitudinal with a total of 2,026 images. Hierarchical clustering was performed to investigate clusters of voxel-level correlations on the timeseries data. The stability of clusters was measured with the average Dice coefficients on two different cross fold validations. The first validated the stability between scans, and the second validated the stability between subject populations. Functional clusters at hierarchical levels 4, 9, 13, 18, and 24 had local maximum stability, suggesting better clustered white matter. In comparison with JHU-DTI-SS Type-I Atlas defined regions, clusters at lower hierarchical levels identified well defined anatomical lobes. At higher hierarchical levels, functional clusters mapped motor and memory functional regions, identifying 50.00%, 20.00%, 27.27%, and 35.14% of the frontal, occipital, parietal, and temporal lobe regions respectively.",

    "abstract": "Mosquito-borne diseases account for nearly one million human deaths annually, yet we have a limited understanding of developmental events that influence host-seeking behavior and pathogen transmission in mosquitoes. Mosquito-borne pathogens are transmitted during blood meals, hence adult mosquito behavior and physiology have been intensely studied. However, events during larval development shape adult traits, larvae respond to many of the same sensory cues as adults, and larvae are susceptible to infection by many of the same disease-causing agents as adults. Hence, a better understanding of larval physiology will directly inform our understanding of physiological processes in adults. Here, we use single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to provide a comprehensive view of cellular composition in the Aedes aegypti larval ventral nerve cord (VNC), a central hub of sensory inputs and motor outputs which additionally controls multiple aspects of larval physiology. We identify more than 35 VNC cell types defined in part by neurotransmitter and neuropeptide expression. We also explore diversity among monoaminergic and peptidergic neurons that likely control key elements of larval physiology and developmental timing, and identify neuroblasts and immature neurons, providing a view of neuronal differentiation in the VNC. Finally, we find that larval cell composition, number, and position are preserved in the adult abdominal VNC, suggesting studies of larval VNC form and function will likely directly inform our understanding adult mosquito physiology. Altogether, these studies provide a framework for targeted analysis of VNC development and neuronal function in Aedes larvae.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundElectrical neurostimulation is a potentially effective therapy in epilepsy but the optimal approach is not yet clear. The parameter space is wide and the effects of different stimulations are not immediately obvious. Functional MRI (fMRI) can reveal which brain areas are affected by stimulation and help understand the induced effects. However, simultaneous deep brain stimulation (DBS)-fMRI examinations in patients are rare and the possibility to investigate multiple stimulation protocols is limited. Preclinical stimulation-fMRI studies can provide predictive value and help identify optimal neurostimulation parameters.\n\nObjectiveTo systematically investigate the brain-wide responses to hippocampal electrical stimulations in a mouse model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) using fMRI.\n\nMethodsWe applied electrical stimulation in the intrahippocampal kainate mouse model of mTLE and assessed the effect of different stimulation amplitudes (80-230 {micro}A) and frequencies (1-100 Hz). In addition, the effect of prolonged 1 Hz stimulation was explored. Saline-injected mice served as controls.\n\nResultsVarying the stimulation amplitudes had little effect on the resulting activation patterns. Low frequency stimulation led to a local response at the stimulation site only, whereas high frequency resulted in a spread of activation from the hippocampal formation into cortical and frontal areas. Prolonged low frequency stimulation reduced excitability.\n\nConclusionsWhile the amplitude parameter offers little opportunity to vary the outcome, the frequency represented the key parameter and determined whether the induced activation remained local or spread across the brain. This is in line with the few DBS-fMRI results obtained in epilepsy patients demonstrating the translational value of fMRI.",

    "abstract": "The completion of mating acutely suppresses sexual motivation in male mice. In contrast, relatively little is known about how the completion of mating affects sexual motivation and sexual behavior in female mice. How the brain responds to completion of mating is also unclear. Here, by using self-paced mating assay, we first demonstrate that female mice show decreased sexual motivation after the completion of mating. By using brain-wide analysis of activity-dependent labeling, we next pin-pointed the medial preoptic area as a brain region strongly responding to mating completion. Furthermore, using freely moving in vivo calcium imaging to compare neural activity of inhibitory and excitatory neurons in the medial preoptic area, we revealed that a subset of neurons responds significantly and specifically to mating completion but not to appetitive or consummatory behaviors. While there were excitatory and inhibitory neurons that showed positive response to the completion of mating, the response magnitude as well as the proportion of neurons responding to the event was significantly larger in the inhibitory neuron population. Next, by unbiased classification of their responses, we also found a subpopulation of neurons that increase their activity late after the onset of the completion of mating. These neurons were all inhibitory indicating that the completion of mating induces a prolonged inhibitory activity in the medial preoptic area. Lastly, we found that chemogenetic activation of medial preoptic area neurons that respond to mating completion, but not to appetitive behaviors, was sufficient to suppress female sexual motivation. Together, our data illuminate the importance of medial preoptic area as a brain node which encodes a negative signal that sustains low sexual motivation state after the completion of mating in female mice.\n\nHighlightsO_LIFemale mice show decreased sexual motivation after mating completion.\nC_LIO_LIA subset of MPOA neurons respond specifically to mating completion.\nC_LIO_LIMating completion evokes persistent activity in MPOA inhibitory neurons.\nC_LIO_LIActivation of a subset of MPOA neurons is sufficient to suppress female sexual motivation.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The brain demonstrates a sustained capacity for cortical plasticity, as extensively studied in task-dependent training contexts. However, the cortical plasticity induced by exposure-based learning has been largely ignored despite its potential significance in promoting generalization and adaptability, thereby allowing individuals to effortlessly apply their knowledge across diverse tasks. One of the key mechanisms underlying the cortical plasticity induced by learning is the replay of learned events, as originally described for rodents and recently identified in humans. In the current study, we recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals to investigate the relationship between exposure-based sequence learning and replay in the human brain. Participants were exposed to a predefined sequence of four motion directions for 30 min, and subsequently presented with start/end motion direction of the sequence as a cue aiming to induce replay of the motion sequence. During the post-cue blank period, we observed a backward replay of the motion sequence in a time-compressed manner. These effects were marginally significant even for a very brief exposure. However, when we flashed the second or third motion direction of the sequence as a cue, no replay events were observed. Further analyses revealed that activity in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) preceded the ripple power in the visual cortex at replay onset, implying a potentially coordinated relationship between the activity in the MTL and visual cortex. Taken together, our study demonstrated the rapid development of replay events induced by simple visual exposure in humans, providing new insights into the mechanisms underlying cortical plasticity even without explicit training tasks.",

    "abstract": "What is good in one scenario might be bad in another. Despite the ubiquity of such contextual reasoning in everyday choice, how the brain flexibly utilizes different valuation schemes across contexts remains unknown. We addressed this question by monitoring neural activity from the hippocampus (HPC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) of two monkeys performing a state-dependent choice task. We found that HPC neurons encoded state information as it became available and then, at the time of choice, relayed this information to OFC via theta synchronization. During choice, OFC represented value in a state-dependent manner: many OFC neurons uniquely coded for value in only one state but not the other. This suggests a functional dissociation whereby HPC encodes contextual information that is broadcast to OFC via theta synchronization to select a state-appropriate value subcircuit, thus allowing for contextual reasoning in value-based choice.",

Here we show that Tfap2a has two highly conserved binding sites for miR-137 and both display a reciprocal expression pattern at the NPB and NP respectively. In addition, ectopic miR-137 expression reduced TFAP2A, whereas its functional inhibition expanded their territorial distribution overlapping with PAX7. Furthermore, we demonstrated that loss of the de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A expanded miR-137 expression to the NPB. Bisulfite sequencing showed a significantly higher level of non-canonical CpH methylation at the promoter of miR-137 when we compared NPB and NP samples.

To address this, we leverage the Drosophila gonadal niche, combining genetic tractability with live-imaging. We have previously shown that proper positioning of niche cells relies on signaling from visceral mesoderm. Here, we show that once positioned, niche cells robustly polarize filamentous actin and Non-muscle Myosin II (MyoII) towards neighboring germ cells. Actomyosin tension along the niche periphery generates a highly reproducible smoothened contour. Without contractility, niches are misshapen and exhibit defects in their ability to regulate germline stem cell behavior. We additionally show that germ cells aid in polarizing MyoII within niche cells, and that extrinsic input is required for niche morphogenesis and function.

    "abstract": "MecA is a highly conserved adaptor protein encoded by prokaryotes from the Bacillota phylum. MecA mutants exhibit similar pleiotropic defects in a variety of organisms, although most of these phenotypes currently lack a mechanistic basis. MecA mediates ClpCP-dependent proteolysis of its substrates, but only several such substrates have been reported in the literature and there are suggestions that proteolysis-independent regulatory mechanisms may also exist. Here, we provide the first comprehensive characterization of the MecA interactome and further assess its regulatory role in Clp-dependent proteolysis. Untargeted coimmunoprecipitation assays coupled with mass spectrometry revealed that the MecA ortholog from the oral pathobiont Streptococcus mutans likely serves as a major protein interaction network hub by potentially complexing with >100 distinct protein substrates, most of which function in highly conserved metabolic pathways. The interactome results were independently verified using a newly developed prokaryotic split luciferase complementation assay (SLCA) to detect MecA protein-protein interactions in vivo. In addition, we further develop a new application of SLCA to support in vivo measurements of MecA relative protein binding affinities. SLCA results were independently verified using targeted coimmunoprecipitation assays, suggesting the general utility of this approach for prokaryotic protein-protein interaction studies. Our results indicate that MecA indeed regulates its interactome through both Clp-dependent proteolysis as well as through an as yet undefined proteolysis-independent mechanism that may affect more than half of its protein interactome.

    "abstract": "The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein (Env) precursor (gp160) trimerizes, is modified by high-mannose glycans in the endoplasmic reticulum, and is transported via Golgi and non-Golgi secretory pathways to the infected cell surface. In the Golgi, gp160 is partially modified by complex carbohydrates and proteolytically cleaved to produce the mature functional Env trimer, which is preferentially incorporated into virions. Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) generally recognize the cleaved Env trimer, whereas poorly neutralizing antibodies (pNAbs) bind the conformationally flexible gp160. We found that expression of bNAbs, pNAbs or soluble/membrane forms of the receptor, CD4, in cells producing HIV-1 all decreased viral infectivity. Four patterns of co-expressed ligand:Env were observed: 1) Ligands (CD4, soluble CD4-Ig and some pNAbs) that specifically recognize the CD4-bound Env conformation resulted in uncleaved Envs lacking complex glycans that were not incorporated into virions; 2) Other pNAbs produced Envs with some complex carbohydrates and severe defects in cleavage, which were relieved by brefeldin A treatment; 3) bNAbs that recognize gp160 as well as mature Envs resulted in Envs with some complex carbohydrates and moderate decreases in virion Env cleavage; and 4) bNAbs that preferentially recognize mature Envs produced cleaved Envs with complex glycans in cells and on virions. The low infectivity observed upon co-expression of pNAbs or CD4 could be explained by disruption of Env trafficking, reducing the level of Env and/or increasing the fraction of uncleaved Env on virions. In addition to bNAb effects on virion Env cleavage, the secreted bNAbs neutralized the co-expressed viruses.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimers on the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) mediate virus entry into host cells. Env is synthesized in infected cells, modified by complex sugars and cleaved to form a mature, functional Env, which is incorporated into virus particles. Env elicits antibodies in infected individuals, some of which can neutralize the virus. We found that antibodies co-expressed in the virus-producing cell can disrupt Env transit to the proper compartment for cleavage and sugar modification and, in some cases, block incorporation into viruses. These studies provide insights into the processes by which Env becomes functional in the virus-producing cell and may assist attempts to interfere with these events to inhibit HIV-1 infection.",

    "abstract": "River microbial communities regularly act as the first defense barrier against the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARG) that enter environmental microbiomes through wastewaters. However, how the invasion dynamics of wastewater-born ARGs into river biofilm communities will shift due to increasing average and peak temperatures worldwide through climate change remains unknown. Here we aimed at elucidating the effects of increasing temperatures on both, the natural river biofilm resistome, as well as the river biofilms invadability by foreign, wastewater-born ARGs. To achieve this, natural biofilms were grown in a pristine German river and transferred to artificial laboratory recirculation flume systems at three different temperatures (20{degrees}C, 25{degrees}C, 30{degrees}C). Already after one week of acclimatization to the temperatures, significant increases in the abundance of most naturally occurring ARGs were detected in the biofilms exposed to the highest temperature. Thereafter, biofilms were exposed to a single pulse of wastewater and the invasion dynamics of wastewater-born ARGs were analyzed over a period of two weeks. While initially after one day ARGs were able to invade all biofilms successfully and in equal proportions, the foreign invading ARGs were lost at a far increased rate at 30{degrees}C over time. ARG levels dropped to the initial natural levels at 30{degrees}C after 14 days. Contrary at the lower temperatures ARGs remained far elevated and certain ARGs were able to establish themselves in the biofilms. Overall, we here demonstrate tradeoffs of increasing temperature between increases in naturally occurring and faster loss dynamics of invading ARGs.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, environmental metagenomics and PCR-based marker gene surveys have revealed that several lineages beyond just a few well-established groups within the Euryarchaeota superphylum harbor the genetic potential for methanogenesis. One of these groups are the Archaeoglobi, a class of obligately thermophilic Euryarchaeotes that have long been considered to live a non-methanogenic lifestyle. Here, we enriched Candidatus Methanoglobus hypatiae, a methanogen affiliated with the family Archaeoglobaceae, from a hot spring in Yellowstone National Park. The enrichment is sediment-free, grows at 64-70 {degrees}C and a pH of 7.8, and produces methane from mono-, di-, and tri-methylamine. Ca. M. hypatiae is represented by a 1.62 Mb metagenome-assembled genome with an estimated completeness of 100% and accounts for up to 67% of cells in the culture according to fluorescence in situ hybridization. Via genome-resolved metatranscriptomics and stable isotope tracing, we demonstrate that Ca. M. hypatiae expresses methylotrophic methanogenesis and energy-conserving pathways for reducing monomethylamine to methane. The detection of Archaeoglobi populations related to Ca. M. hypatiae in 36 geochemically diverse geothermal sites within Yellowstone National Park (pH 2.61-9.35; 18.4 to 93.8 {degrees}C), as revealed through the examination of previously published gene amplicon datasets, implies a previously underestimated contribution to anaerobic carbon cycling in extreme ecosystems.\n\nSignificance statementThe majority of global methane emissions are attributed to the activity of methane-producing anaerobic archaea, the methanogens. Over the last decade, environmental DNA sequencing demonstrated that culture collections do not adequately represent the true taxonomic and metabolic diversity of methanogens present in nature. One group of archaea postulated to contribute to methane production in high temperature marine and terrestrial environments are the Archaeoglobi, a group of obligate thermophilic archaea within the Euryarchaeota superphylum. Here, we report the cultivation and physiological characterization of a methanogenic member of the Archaeoglobi, Ca. Methanoglobus hypatiae, from a hot spring in Yellowstone National Park. Via a combination of growth experiments, stable isotope tracing, metatranscriptomics, microscopy analyses, and re-examination of gene amplicon surveys, our study provides direct experimental evidence of methanogenesis in the Archaeoglobi and shows that closely related archaea are widely distributed in Yellowstones geothermal features.",

    "abstract": "Tardigrades, microscopic animals found in virtually all ecosystems, are renowned for their remarkable ability to withstand extreme conditions. Recent studies have identified novel tardigrade specific protein families that aid in resistance to desiccation and ionizing radiation (IR). Notably, a tardigrade specific DNA binding protein called Dsup (for DNA damage suppressor) has been found to protect from X-ray damage in human cells and from hydroxyl radicals in vitro. However, Dsup has only been found in two species within the Hypsibioidea superfamily.\n\nTo better understand mechanisms underlying radio-resistance in the Tardigrada phylum, we first characterized DNA damage and repair in response to IR in the model species Hypsibius exemplaris. By analysis of phosphorylated H2AX, we demonstrated the induction and repair of DNA double-strand breaks after IR exposure. Importantly, the rate of single-strand breaks induced was roughly equivalent to that in human cells, suggesting that DNA repair plays a predominant role in the remarkable radio-resistance of tardigrades. In order to identify novel tardigrade specific genes involved, we next conducted a comparative transcriptomics across three species, H. exemplaris, Acutuncus antarcticus and Paramacrobiotus fairbanksi, the latter belonging to the Macrobiotoidea superfamily known to lack Dsup homologs. In all three species, many genes of DNA repair were among the most strongly overexpressed genes alongside a novel tardigrade specific gene, named Tardigrade DNA damage Response protein 1 (TDR1). We found that TDR1 protein interacts with DNA and forms aggregates at high concentration suggesting it may condensate DNA and act by preserving chromosome organization until DNA repair is accomplished. Remarkably, when expressed in human cells, TDR1 improved resistance to Bleomycin, a radiomimetic drug. Based on these findings, we propose that TDR1 is a novel tardigrade specific gene responsible for conferring resistance to IR. Our study sheds light on mechanisms of DNA repair helping to cope with high levels of DNA damage. Furthermore, it suggests that at least two tardigrade specific genes, respectively for Dsup and TDR1, have independently evolved DNA-binding functions that contribute to radio-resistance in the Tardigrada phylum.",

    "abstract": "Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy associated hypertensive disease. It is one of the major causes of pregnancy-related maternal/perinatal adverse health outcomes, with a lack of highly effective preventative strategies and/or therapeutic interventions. Our group has previously identified distinct subclasses of pathophysiology underlying a PE diagnosis, one of which exhibits heightened immune activation at the gestational parent-fetal interface, identified as inflammatory-driven PE. In non-pregnant populations, chronic inflammation is associated with reduced cellular availability of NAD+, a vitamin B3-derived metabolite involved in energy metabolism and mitochondrial function. Interestingly, specifically in placentas from women with inflammatory-driven PE, we observed increased activity of NAD+-consuming PARP enzymes and reduced NAD+ content. Moreover, these placentas had decreased expression of several mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) proteins and evidence of oxidative damage. This human data was supported by cell culture findings, which likewise demonstrated increased PARP activity, coupled to decreased mitochondrial respiration rates and decreased invasive function of cultured HTR8 human trophoblast cells, following inflammatory induction by TNF-. Importantly, these adverse inflammatory effects were attenuated by boosting cellular NAD+ levels with nicotinamide riboside (NR). Finally, using an LPS-induced rodent model of inflammatory-driven PE, we demonstrated that NR administration (200mg/kg/day) from gestational day (GD) 1-19 could prevent the development of maternal hypertension and fetal/placental growth restriction, improve placental mitochondrial function, reduce placental inflammation and oxidative stress. Thus, this study demonstrates the critical role of NAD+ metabolism in maintaining healthy placental function and identifies NAD+ boosting as a promising preventative strategy for the inflammatory-driven subclass of PE.\n\nOne sentence summaryBoosting NAD+ levels prevent inflammatory-driven preeclampsia by improving placental mitochondrial function.",

    "abstract": "Spinocerebellar ataxia types 2 (SCA2) and 3 (SCA3/MJD) are diseases due to dominant unstable expansions of CAG repeats (CAGexp). Age of onset of symptoms (AO) correlates with the CAGexp length. Repeat instability leads to new expansions, to important AO anticipations and to the eventual extinction of lineages. Because of that, compensatory forces are expected to act on the maintenance of expanded alleles, but they are poorly understood. Here, we described the CAGexp dynamics, adapting a classical equation and aiming to estimate for how many generations will the descendants of a de novo expansion last. A mathematical model was adapted to encompass anticipation, fitness, and allelic segregation; and empirical data fed the model. The arbitrated ancestral mutations included in the model had the lowest CAGexp and the highest AO described in the literature. One thousand generations were simulated until the alleles were eliminated, fixed, or 650 generations had passed. All SCA2 lineages were eliminated in a median of 10 generations. In SCA3/MJD lineages, 593 were eliminated in a median of 29 generations. The other ones were eliminated due to anticipation after the 650th generation or remained indefinitely with CAG repeats transitioning between expanded and unexpanded ranges. Therefore, the model predicted outcomes compatible with empirical data - the very old ancestral SCA3/MJD haplotype, and the de novo SCA2 expansions -, which previously seemed to be contradictory. This model accommodates these data into understandable dynamics and might be useful for other CAGexp disorders.",

In autophagy this material is encapsulated in double membrane vesicles termed autophagosomes, which form from precursors referred to as phagophores.

How phagophore nucleation and expansion are coordinated with lipid synthesis is unclear. Here, we show that Faa1, an enzyme activating fatty acids, is directly recruited to Atg9 vesicles. We further show that Faa1 binds to negatively charged membranes. We define the membrane binding surface in Faa1 and show that membrane binding is required for its enzymatic activity. In cells, membrane binding by Faa1 is required for its recruitment to phagophores and promotes autophagosome biogenesis. Our results suggest a positive feedback loop coupling phagophore nucleation and expansion to lipid synthesis.\n\nSummaryBaumann, Achleitner, Tulli et al. dissect Faa1 function and recruitment during autophagy.

    "abstract": "Bacterial dispersal, the movement of cells spanning diverse physical scales and environments, has been long investigated owing to its far-reaching ramifications in the ecology and evolution of bacterial species and their consortia. A major proportion of bacterial species are surface associated, yet if and how they disperse, specifically during the early stages of biofilm formation, remains to be understood. While physical vectors like fluid flow drive dispersal across large scales, surface-associated cells may benefit from the active biomechanical forces to navigate locally within a colony. Here, by analyzing sessile bacterial colonies, we study how cells disperse over generations due to the growth-induced forces under different conditions. A custom-built labelfree algorithm, developed to track the progeny cells as they grow and divide, reveals the emergence of distinct self-similar genealogical enclaves which intermix over time. Biological activity, indicated by the division times, is a key determinant of the intermixing dynamics; while topological defects appearing at the interface of the enclaves mediate the morphology of finger-like interfacial domains. By quantifying the Shannon entropy, we show that dividing bacterial cells have spatial affinity to close relatives, at the cost of the entropically favourable option of intermixing, wherein faster growing colonies show higher drop in the Shannon entropy over time. A coarse-grained lattice modelling of such colonies, combined with insights from the thermodynamics of phase separation, suggest that the emergence of genealogical enclaves results from an interplay of growth-induced cell dispersal within the colony (which promotes intermixing) and stochasticity of cell division, alongwith the cell-cell interactions at a given growth condition. Our study uncovers the evolution of so-far hidden emergent self-organising features within growing bacterial colonies, which while displaying a high degree of self-similarity on a range of phenotypic traits, point at competing roles of growth-induced forces and entropic landscapes which ultimately shape the genealogical distance of cells to their kith and kin within growing colonies.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryLabel-free tracking of cells reveals spatio-temporal evolution of genealogical enclaves in growing bacterial colonies resulting from activity-controlled emergent demixing of cell lineages.",

    "abstract": "HIV-1 efficiently replicates in vivo by direct transmission from infected to uninfected CD4+ T cells at confined local sites designated virological synapses (VSs). VSs are formed by cell junctions between HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Envs) on an infected cell and CD4 on an uninfected cell. These sites facilitate highly efficient viral transmission and contribute to HIV-1 evasion from neutralizing antibodies, but accurate quantification of the efficiency of cell-cell transmission is still challenging. Here, we developed an ultrasensitive HIV-1 cell- to-cell transmission assay that triggers the expression of the nanoluciferase (nluc) gene in target cells upon transmission and after reverse transcription of the HIV-1 RNA genome. The assay is based on insertion of the nluc gene in an antisense orientation into HIV-1 provirus; Nluc expression is blocked in virus-producing cells because the nluc gene contains an intron that can be efficiently spliced out only when mRNA is transcribed from the opposite (sense) strand. Thus, only sense mRNA that is spliced and subsequently reversed transcribed during transmission to target cells will support Nluc expression. Assay optimization resulted in a very low background, >99% splicing efficiency, high sensitivity and wide dynamic range for detection of cell-cell transmission in T cell lines and primary CD4+ T cells. The new reporter vector can detect cell-cell transmission using single-round viral vectors and HIV-1 molecular clones, which provide viral proteins of different HIV-1 strains, and reproducibly measures sensitivity of HIV-1 transmission to antibody neutralization in vitro. This assay will contribute to understanding fundamental mechanisms of HIV-1 cell-to-cell transmission, allow evaluation of pre-existing or acquired HIV-1 resistance in clinical trials, and can be adapted to study other retroviruses.",

    "abstract": "G-quadruplexes (G4s) are non-canonical nucleic acid structures that fold through complex processes. Characterization of G4 folding landscape contributes to comprehending G4 roles in gene regulation but is challenging for experiments and computations. Here we investigate the folding of a three-quartet parallel DNA G4 with (GGGA)3GGG sequence using all-atom explicit-solvent enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We suggest an early formation of guanine stacks in the G-tracts, which behave as semi-rigid blocks in the folding process. The parallel G4 folding is initiated by the formation of a collapsed compact coil-like ensemble. Structuring of the G4 from the coil then proceeds via various cross-like, hairpin, slip-stranded, and two-quartet ensembles and can bypass the G-triplex structure. While parallel G-hairpins are extremely unstable when isolated, they are more stable inside the coil structure. Folding of parallel G4 does not appear to involve any salient intermediates and, instead, it is an extremely multiple-pathway process. On the methodology side, we show that the AMBER DNA force field predicts the folded G4 to be less stable than the unfolded ensemble, uncovering substantial force-field issues. Overall, we provide unique atomistic insights into the folding landscape of parallel-stranded G4 but also reveal limitations of the state-of-the-art MD techniques.",

    "abstract": "At least 53 mutations in the microtubule associated protein tau gene (MAPT) have been identified that cause frontotemporal dementia. 47 of these mutations are localized between exons 7 and 13. They could thus affect the formation of circular RNAs (circRNAs) from the MAPT gene that occur through backsplicing from exon 12 to either exon 10 or exon 7. We analyzed representative mutants and found that five FTDP-17 mutations increase the formation of 127 circRNA and three different mutations increase the amount of 1210 circRNA. CircRNAs are translated after undergoing adenosine to inosine RNA editing, catalyzed by ADAR enzymes. We found that the interferon induced ADAR1-p150 isoform has the strongest effect on circTau RNA translation. ADAR1-p150 activity had a stronger effect on circTau RNA expression and strongly decreased 127 circRNA, but unexpectedly increased 1210 circRNA. In both cases, ADAR-activity strongly promoted translation of circTau RNAs. Unexpectedly, we found that the 127 circTau protein interacts with eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B), which is reduced by four FTDP-17 mutations located in the second microtubule domain. These are the first studies of the effect of human mutations on circular RNA formation and translation. They show that point mutations influence circRNA expression levels, likely through changes in the secondary pre-mRNA structures. The effect of the mutations is surpassed by editing of the circular RNAs, leading to their translation. Thus, circular RNAs and their editing status should be considered when analyzing FTDP-17 mutations.\n\nHighlightsO_LI47/53 known FTDP-17 mutations are located in regions that could influence generation of circular RNAs from the MAPT gene\nC_LIO_LICircular Tau RNAs are translated after adenosine to inosine RNA editing, most effectively caused by ADAR1-p150\nC_LIO_LIFTDP-17 mutations influence both circTau RNA and circTau protein expression levels\nC_LIO_LICircTau protein expression levels do not correlate with circTau RNA expression levels\nC_LIO_LICircTau proteins bind to eukaryotic initiation factor 4B, which is antagonized by FTDP-17 mutations in exon 10\nC_LI\n\nGraphic Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=187 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/556913v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@94a395org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7fbdc3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@83539eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e6b59e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Apical cell-cell junctions, including adherens junctions (AJs) and tight junctions (TJs), adhere epithelial cells to one another and regulate selective permeability at both bicellular junctions (BCJs) and tricellular junctions (TCJs). Although several specialized proteins are known to localize at TCJs, it remains unclear how actomyosin-mediated tension transmission at TCJs contributes to the maintenance of junction integrity and barrier function at these sites. Here, utilizing gastrula-stage Xenopus laevis embryos as a model system, we describe a mechanism by which Vinculin, a mechanosensitive protein, anchors the actomyosin network at TCJs, thus maintaining TJ stability and barrier function. Using an optogenetic approach, we found that acutely increasing junctional tension results in robust recruitment of Vinculin to apical junctions immediately surrounding TCJs. In Vinculin knockdown (KD) embryos, junctional actomyosin intensity is decreased and becomes disorganized at TCJs. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we show that loss of Vinculin results in reduced Actin stability at TCJs. Vinculin knockdown also destabilizes Angulin-1, a key protein involved in regulating barrier function at TCJs. When Vinculin KD embryos are subjected to increased tension, TCJs cannot maintain their proper morphology. Finally, using a live imaging barrier assay, we detect increased barrier leaks at TCJs in Vinculin KD embryos. Together, our findings show that Vinculin-mediated actomyosin organization is required to maintain junction integrity and barrier function at TCJs and reveal new information about the interplay between adhesion and barrier function at TCJs.\n\nHighlightsO_LIVinculin is mechanosensitively recruited to tricellular junctions\nC_LIO_LIVinculins actin-binding function is needed for tricellular actomyosin organization\nC_LIO_LITricellular tight junctions are unstable when Vinculin is knocked down\nC_LIO_LIVinculin is required to maintain barrier function at tricellular junctions\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) is a crucial gatekeeper in the outer mitochondrial membrane, controlling metabolic and energy homeostasis. The available methodological approaches fell short of accurate visualization of VDAC1 in living cells. To permit precise VDAC1 imaging, we used the tetracysteine (TC)-tag approach and visualized VDAC1 dynamics in living cells. TC-tagged VDAC1 had a cluster-like distribution on mitochondria. The majority of VDAC1-clusters were localized at endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria contact sites. Notably, VDAC1 colocalized with BCL-2 Antagonist/Killer (BAK)-clusters upon apoptotic stimulation. Additionally, VDAC1 was found at mitochondrial fission sites, likely promoting mitochondrial fragmentation. These findings highlight the suitability of the TC-tag for live-cell imaging of VDAC1, shedding light on the roles of VDAC1 in multiple cellular processes.",

    "abstract": "C-C chemokine receptor type 3 (CCR3) has been linked with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) pathologies. Specifically, its function as an immune modulator in AMD remains unclear. To address this question, we investigated the impact of CCR3 inhibition on inflammation, a key driver of AMD pathologies, by assessing inflammatory cytokines and infiltrating immune cells in two models of ocular inflammation.\n\nMice were orally dosed twice a day with AKST4290, a CCR3 small molecular inhibitor, in the sodium iodate (NaIO3) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) models. A combination of autoradiography and analytical chemistry techniques were used to assess drug concentration and distribution. Bead-based multiplexing technology was used to determine cytokine concentrations, and flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry was used to ascertain ocular immune-cell composition.\n\nCCR3 expression was detected in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)/choroid complex where AKST4290 was found to preferentially accumulate at sustained levels. In the NaIO3 model, inhibition of CCR3 with AKST4290 significantly decreased both the concentration of specific chemokines and the number of multiple populations of infiltrating peripheral immune cell. Furthermore, effects of CCR3 inhibition on immune cell infiltration were confirmed in the MOG model.\n\nThese data demonstrate that CCR3 inhibition strongly modulates local inflammation by impacting both cytokine concentrations and immune cell composition in ocular diseases.\n\nMoreover, these findings together with the known role of CCR3 in promoting pathologic angiogenesis implicate a pleiotropic role for CCR3 in AMD.",

This study presents a novel DOL determination technique named Protein-tag DOL (ProDOL), which enables fast DOL measurements and optimisation of protein-tag labelling. With ProDOL various factors affecting labelling efficiency, including substrate type, incubation time, and concentration, as well as sample fixation and cell type can be easily assessed. We applied ProDOL to investigate how HIV-1 pathogenesis factor Nef modulates CD4 T cell activation measuring total and activated copy numbers of the adaptor protein SLP-76 in signalling microclusters.

    "abstract": "3.1Birds are one of the most colourful animal groups in the world and there are multiple ways by which they achieve this feature. Mechanisms of colour production range from pigmentary (pigment deposition) to structural (nanostructural arrangements), or the combination of both. Despite the huge breadth of colour gamut, the basic components of feathers are shared across all of them (keratin, air and presence of pigments in accordance with the colour produced). It has been shown that in some instances, colour evolution between pigmentary and structural colours can proceed by rearrangement of the nano-structural elements of feathers. Here, we investigated evolutionary transitions between pigmentary grey and non-iridescent structural blue. We focus on the Thraupidae (tanagers and allies) that display a variety of blues and greys including a potential transition state that we refer to as slate. We used digitally calibrated images of birds to quantify colour and determine the distinctiveness of slate colour in colourspace. Following, we identify the most likely pathway for the evolution of the colour blue: from grey via slate colour. Our research reveals a new pathway in the evolution of blue colour.",

    "abstract": "Traditional fermented foods often contain specialized microorganisms adapted to the unique food environment. For example, the filamentous mold Aspergillus oryzae, used in sake fermentation, has evolved to thrive in starch-rich conditions compared to its wild ancestor, Aspergillus flavus. Similarly, Aspergillus sojae is used in soybean-based food fermentations (e.g. miso and shochu) and is closely related to Aspergillus parasiticus. Here, we investigated the impact of long-term A. sojae usage in soybean fermentation on population structure, genome variation, and phenotypic traits. We analyzed 12 A. sojae and 10 A. parasiticus genomes, along with phenotypic characteristics of 15 isolates. Our results revealed that A. sojae isolates formed a distinct population separate from A. parasiticus and displayed remarkably low levels of genetic diversity, indicative of a recent clonal expansion. Genome comparisons revealed numerous loss-of-function mutations in A. sojae, notably in genes responsible for secondary metabolite production, including genes in the aflatoxin encoding gene cluster. Consequently, A. sojae lacked aflatoxin production, while it varied among A. parasiticus isolates. No other significant differences were observed in growth rates or other measured phenotypic traits between A. sojae and A. parasiticus. These findings suggest that A. sojae may have evolved from a population of A. parasiticus and lost the ability to produce some secondary metabolites. To elucidate the phenotypic differences between A. sojae and A. parasiticus, future work should focus on the influence of wild and food-associated strains on the sensory aspects and microbial community dynamics of fermented soy products.\n\nSignificance StatementLike plants and animals, microbes were also domesticated by humans, however relatively little is known about how the process of domestication shapes microbial genomes and traits. We found that isolates of Aspergillus sojae, a mold used in the production of miso and soy sauce, makeup a less toxic group that is genetically distinct from its closely related wild ancestor Aspergillus parasiticus. Our analyses shed new light on commonalities observed across filamentous molds adapted to the food environment.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that regulates gene expression, and for mammals typically occurs on cytosines within CpG dinucleotides. A significant challenge for methylation detection methods is accurately measuring methylation levels within GC-rich regions such as gene promoters, as inaccuracies compromise downstream biological interpretation of the data. To address this challenge, we compared methylation levels assayed using four different methods: Enzymatic Methyl-seq (EM-seq), whole genome bisulphite sequencing (WGBS), Infinium arrays (Illumina MethylationEPIC, \"EPIC\"), and Oxford Nanopore Technologies nanopore sequencing (ONT) applied to human DNA. Overall, all methods produced comparable and consistent methylation readouts across the human genome. The flexibility offered by current gold standard WGBS in interrogating genome-wide cytosines is surpassed technically by both EM-seq and ONT, as their coverages and methylation readouts are less prone to GC bias. These advantages are tempered by higher costs (EM-seq) and higher complexity (ONT). We further assess the strengths and weaknesses of each method, and provide recommendations in choosing the most appropriate methylation method for specific scientific questions or translational needs.",
