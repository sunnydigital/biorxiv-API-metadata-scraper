    "abstract": "Fluorescence imaging of calcium dynamics has revolutionized cellular biology, and especially neuroscience as it allows the study of neural activity across spatially well defined populations. Quantification of fluorescence signals is commonly performed using ratiometric measures. These measures, such as {Delta}F/F, are easy to implement, but they depend on the definition of a baseline, which is often not trivial outside of the measurement of evoked responses, and needs to be defined for every cell (or other cellular compartment) separately. Here, we present a new quantitative measure of fluorescence by taking advantage of the time dimension of the signal. The new method, which we named ARES (Autoregressive RESiduals), is based on the quantification of residuals after linear autoregression and does not require arbitrary baseline assignment. We detail the basic characteristics of the ARES signal, compare it against {Delta}F/F, and quantify the improvement in spatial and temporal resolution of recorded calcium data. We further exemplify its utility in the study of intracellular calcium dynamics by describing the propagation of a calcium wave inside a dendrite. As a robust and accurate method for quantifying fluorescence signals, ARES is particularly well-suited for the study of spontaneous as well as evoked calcium dynamics, subcellular localization of calcium signals, and spatiotemporal tracking of calcium dynamics.\n\nHighlightsO_LIA baseline-free quantitative measure of fluorescence is introduced\nC_LIO_LIThe method, called ARES, is based on autoregression\nC_LIO_LIARES improves the spatiotemporal resolution of calcium imaging recordings\nC_LIO_LIIts utility for the localization and spatiotemporal tracking of calcium is shown\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The localization of condensin along chromosomes is crucial for their accurate segregation in anaphase. Condensin is enriched at telomeres but how and for what purpose had remained elusive. Here we show that fission yeast condensin accumulates at telomere repeats through the balancing acts of Taz1, a core component of the shelterin complex that ensures telomeric functions, and Mit1, a nucleosome-remodeler associated with shelterin. We further show that condensin takes part in sister-telomere separation in anaphase, and that this event can be uncoupled from the prior separation of chromosome arms, implying a telomere-specific separation mechanism. Consistent with a cis-acting process, increasing or decreasing condensin occupancy specifically at telomeres modifies accordingly the efficiency of their separation in anaphase. Genetic evidence suggests that condensin promotes sister-telomere separation by counteracting cohesin. Thus, our results reveal a shelterin-based mechanism that enriches condensin at telomeres to drive in cis their separation during mitosis.",

    "abstract": "Taxanes are known to have a profound effect on endothelial cells and the vasculature even at low doses. Here, we show that taxanes, rather than being anti-angiogenic, function more as vascular disrupting agents (VDAs), although they exert a different mechanism of vascular permeabilization when compared to traditional VDAs such as combretastatins. In the tumor context, this VDA-effect leads to a rapid vascular collapse and acute hypoxia. Concomitant treatment with anti-VEGF drugs aggravates hypoxia by blocking vasculogenic rescue mechanisms. While this results in a strong growth-suppressing effect on the tumor, it also increases its invasiveness and metastatic potential. We demonstrate that combination of anti-angiogenic drugs with taxanes blocks tumor reperfusion, intensifies intravasation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and strongly increases metastasis. Anti-VEGF drugs are commonly applied in combination with cytotoxic drugs including taxanes. Our findings have significant implications for the clinical use of this drug combination.",

    "abstract": "The Sortilin-related receptor 1 gene (SORL1, SORLA) is strongly associated with risk of developing Alzheimers disease (AD). SORLA is a regulator of endosomal trafficking in neurons and interacts with retromer, a complex that is a  master conductor of endosomal trafficking. Pharmacological chaperones stabilize retromer in vitro, enhancing its function. Here we used an isogenic series of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines with either one or two copies of SORL1 or harboring one copy of a SORL1 variant linked to increased risk for AD. We treated hiPSC-derived cortical neurons with the established retromer chaperone, TPT-260, and tested whether indicators of ADs defining endosomal, amyloid, and Tau pathologies were corrected. We observed that the degree of rescue by TPT-260 treatment varied, depending on the number of copies of functional SORL1 and which SORL1 variant was expressed. Using a disease-relevant preclinical model, our work illuminates how the SORL1-retromer pathway can be therapeutically harnessed.",

Each branched organ has a distinct architecture customized to its physiological function, but how patterning occurs in these ramified tubular structures is a fundamental problem of development. Here we use quantitative 3D morphometrics, time-lapse imaging, manipulation of ex vivo cultured embryonic organs, and mice deficient in the planar cell polarity component Vangl2 to address this question in the developing mammary gland. Our results show that the embryonic epithelial trees are highly complex in topology owing to the flexible use of two distinct modes of branch point initiation: lateral branching and tip bifurcation. This non-stereotypy was contrasted by the remarkably constant average branch frequency indicating a ductal growth-invariant, yet stochastic propensity to branch. The probability to branch was malleable and could be tuned by manipulating the Fgf10 and Tgf-{beta}1 pathways. Finally, our in vivo and ex vivo time-lapse imaging suggested the involvement of tissue rearrangements in mammary branch elongation.",

    "abstract": "Bees are important pollinators of agricultural crops, but their populations are at risk when pesticides are used. One of the largest risks bees face is poisoning of floral nectar and pollen by insecticides. Studies of bee detection of neonicotinoids have reported contradictory evidence about whether bees can taste these pesticides in sucrose solutions and hence avoid them. Here, we use an assay for the detection of food aversion combined with single-sensillum electrophysiology to test whether the mouthparts of the buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) detect the presence of pesticides in a solution that mimicked the nectar of oilseed rape (Brassica napus). Bees did not avoid consuming solutions containing concentrations of imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin, or sulfoxaflor spanning six orders of magnitude, even when these solutions contained lethal doses. Only extremely high concentrations of the pesticides altered spiking in gustatory neurons through a slight reduction in firing rate or change in the rate of adaptation. These data provide strong evidence that bumblebees cannot detect or avoid field-relevant concentrations of pesticides using information from their mouthparts. As bees rarely contact floral nectar with other body parts, we predict that they are at high risk of unwittingly consuming pesticides in the nectar of pesticide-treated crops.",

    "abstract": "Methods using genomic information to forecast potential population maladaptation to climate change are becoming increasingly common, yet the lack of model validation poses serious hurdles toward their incorporation into management and policy. Here, we compare the validation of maladaptation estimates derived from two methods - Gradient Forests (GFoffset) and the Risk Of Non-Adaptedness (RONA) - using exome capture pool-seq data from 35 to 39 populations across three conifer taxa: two Douglas-fir varieties and jack pine. We evaluate sensitivity of these algorithms to the source of input loci (markers selected from genotype-environment associations [GEA] or those selected at random). We validate these methods against two-year and 52-year growth and mortality measured in independent transplant experiments. Overall, we find that both methods often better predict transplant performance than climatic or geographic distances. We also find that GFoffset and RONA models are surprisingly not improved using GEA candidates. Even with promising validation results, variation in model projections to future climates makes it difficult to identify the most maladapted populations using either method. Our work advances understanding of the sensitivity and applicability of these approaches, and we discuss recommendations for their future use.",

    "abstract": "Traditionally, the exogenous allosteric modulators of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been extensively investigated due to their pharmacological significance. However, to date, only a handful of endogenous intracellular allosteric modulators are known, that too with inconclusive binding information and their associated phenotypes. This limitation primarily stems from the non-availability of robust computational techniques that entail unbiased cavity identification across GPCR protein topology, cavity-specific ligand design, their synthesis, and cross-validation. Here, we introduce Gcoupler, which leverages an integrative approach combining de novo ligand design, statistical methods, and Graph Neural Networks for rationally predicting high-affinity ligands. Gcoupler offers an efficient and comparatively faster route to explore allosteric sites of GPCRs, including the GPCR-G interface. We tested and validated the applicability of Gcoupler in decrypting the cellular metabolites that could intracellularly modulate the Ste2 (GPCR)-mediated pheromone-induced cell death in yeast. Our rigorous interrogation using Gcoupler and experimental approaches, including yeast genetic screening, RNA sequencing, high-resolution metabolomics, and functional assays, identified endogenous hydrophobic metabolites, mainly specific sterols, as intracellular allosteric modulators of Ste2p signaling. Elevated intracellular levels of these metabolites, either naturally, through genetic alterations, or exogenous treatment, rescue the pheromone-induced programmed cell death. Computational insights revealed that these metabolites harbor high binding affinity to the conserved GPCR-G interface and might trigger a cohesive response that potentially obstructs downstream signaling. Finally, by utilizing isoproterenol-induced, GPCR-mediated human and neonatal rat cardiac hypertrophy models, we observed that elevated metabolite levels attenuate hypertrophic response, reinforcing the functional and evolutionary relevance of this mechanism. In summary, our study reports a robust computational approach for efficiently exploring the allosteric sites in GPCRs.",

Although M. orygis has been reported from different geographic regions around the world, due to a lack of proper identification techniques, the contribution of this emerging pathogen to the global burden of zoonotic tuberculosis is not fully understood. In the present work, we report single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) analysis using whole genome sequencing (WGS) that can accurately identify M. orygis and differentiate it from other members of MTBC species. WGS-based SNPs analysis was performed for 61 isolates from different Provinces in Canada that were identified as M. orygis. A total of 56 M. orygis sequences from the public databases were also included in the analysis. Several unique SNPs in gyrB, PPE55, Rv2042c, leuS, mmpL6, and mmpS6 genes were used to determine their effectiveness as genetic markers for the identification of M. orygis. To the best of our knowledge, five of these SNPs, viz., gyrB277 (A[-&gt;]G), gyrB1478 (T[-&gt;]C), leuS1064 (A[-&gt;]T), mmpL6486 (T[-&gt;]C), and mmpS6334 (C[-&gt;]G) are reported for the first time in this study. Our results also revealed several SNPs specific to other species within MTBC. The phylogenetic analysis shows that studied genomes were genetically diverse and clustered with M. orygis sequences of human and animal origin reported from different geographic locations. Therefore, the present study provides a new insight into the high confidence identification of M. orygis from MTBC species based on WGS data, which can be useful for reference and diagnostic laboratories.",

Despite the well resolved forskolin density, the captured state of AC8 does not favour tight nucleotide binding.

Mechanistically, Tld1 LD targeting requires TG, and is mediated by two distinct hydrophobic regions (HRs). Molecular dynamics simulations reveal Tld1s HRs interact with TG on LDs and adopt specific conformations on TG-rich LDs versus SE-rich LDs in yeast and human cells. Tld1-deficient yeast display no defect in LD biogenesis, but exhibit elevated TG lipolysis dependent on lipase Tgl3. Remarkably, over-expression of Tld1, but not LD protein Pln1/Pet10, promotes TG accumulation without altering SE pools. Finally, we find Tld1-deficient cells display altered LD mobilization during extended yeast starvation. We propose Tld1 senses TG-rich LDs and regulates lipolysis on LD subpopulations.",

To understand how these representations unfold over time, we recorded human intracranial electroencephalography responses to 120 object images at five consecutive stages of the ventral pathway from V1 to occipitotemporal areas. Using representational similarity analysis, we confirmed that response patterns were more strongly driven by low-order stimulus properties at early stages and high-order category information at late stages, respectively. Interestingly, response patterns also became less stimulus-driven and more categorical at all stages over time, from [~]100 to 200 ms post-stimulus. During this period, we found significant noise correlation between single-trial response patterns across stages, indicating tight inter-areal coupling. Thus, multi-areal recurrent processes may be essential in building high-order object representations.",

Here we describe two different kinds of cheating in mutualistic networks and use a generalized Lotka-Volterra model to show that they have very different consequences for the persistence of the community. Conservative cheating, where a species cheats on its mutualistic partners to escape the cost of mutualistic interactions, negatively affects community persistence. In contrast, innovative cheating occurs with species with whom legitimate interactions are not possible, because of a physiological or morphological barrier. Innovative cheating can enhance community persistence under some conditions: when cheaters have few mutualistic partners, cheat at low or intermediate frequency and the cost associated with mutualism is not too high. In this case, the negative effects of cheating on partner persistence are over-compensated at the community level by the positive feedback loops that arise in mutualistic networks. Using an empirical dataset of plant-bird interactions, we found that observed cheating patterns are highly consistent with theoretical cheating patterns found to increase community persistence. This result suggests that the cheating patterns observed in nature could contribute to promote species coexistence in mutualistic communities, instead of necessarily destabilizing them.",

    "abstract": "MotivationMicrobial communities influence both human health and different environments. Viruses infecting bacteria, known as bacteriophages or phages, play a key role in modulating bacterial communities within environments. High-quality phage genome sequences are essential for advancing our understanding of phage biology, enabling comparative genomics studies, and developing phage-based diagnostic tools. Most available viral identification tools consider individual sequences to determine whether they are of viral origin. As a result of the challenges in viral assembly, fragmentation of genomes can occur, leading to the need for new approaches in viral identification. Therefore, the identification and characterisation of novel phages remain a challenge.\n\nResultsWe introduce Phables, a new computational method to resolve phage genomes from fragmented viral metagenome assemblies. Phables identifies phage-like components in the assembly graph, models each component as a flow network, and uses graph algorithms and flow decomposition techniques to identify genomic paths. Experimental results of viral metagenomic samples obtained from different environments show that Phables recovers on average over 49% more high-quality phage genomes compared to existing viral identification tools. Furthermore, Phables can resolve variant phage genomes with over 99% average nucleotide identity, a distinction that existing tools are unable to make.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationPhables is available on GitHub at https://github.com/Vini2/phables.\n\nContactvijini.mallawaarachchi@flinders.edu.au",

    "abstract": "Reverse genetic systems enable the engineering of RNA virus genomes and are instrumental in studying RNA virus biology. With the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, already established methods were challenged by the large genome of SARS-CoV-2. Herein we present an elaborated strategy for the rapid and straightforward rescue of recombinant plus-stranded RNA viruses with high sequence fidelity, using the example of SARS-CoV-2. The strategy called CLEVER (CLoning-free and Exchangeable system for Virus Engineering and Rescue) is based on the intracellular recombination of transfected overlapping DNA fragments allowing the direct mutagenesis within the initial PCR-amplification step. Furthermore, by introducing a linker fragment - harboring all heterologous sequences - viral RNA can directly serve as a template for manipulating and rescuing recombinant mutant virus, without any cloning step. Overall, this strategy will facilitate recombinant SARS-CoV-2 rescue and accelerate its manipulation. Using our protocol, newly emerging variants can quickly be engineered to further elucidate their biology. To demonstrate its potential as a reverse genetics platform for plus-stranded RNA viruses, the protocol has been successfully applied for the cloning-free rescue of recombinant Chikungunya and Dengue virus.",

    "abstract": "A long-standing question is to what degree genetic drift and selection drive the divergence in rare accessory gene content between closely related bacteria. Rare genes, including singletons, make up a large proportion of pangenomes (the set of all genes in a set of genomes), but it remains unclear how many such genes are adaptive, deleterious, or neutral to their host genome. Estimates of species effective population sizes (Ne) are positively associated with pangenome size and fluidity, which has independently been interpreted as evidence for both neutral and adaptive pangenome models. We hypothesised that pseudogenes, used as a neutral reference, could be used to distinguish these models. We find that most functional categories are depleted for rare pseudogenes when a genome encodes only a single intact copy of a gene family. In contrast, transposons are enriched in pseudogenes, suggesting they are mostly neutral or deleterious to the host genome. Thus, even if individual rare accessory genes vary in their effects on host fitness, we can confidently reject a model of entirely neutral or deleterious rare genes. We also define the ratio of singleton intact genes to singleton pseudogenes (si/sp) within a pangenome, compare this measure across 668 prokaryotic species, and detect a signal consistent with the adaptive value of many rare accessory genes. Taken together, our work demonstrates that comparing to pseudogenes can improve inferences of the evolutionary forces driving pangenome variation.",

    "abstract": "Environmental heterogeneity can lead to spatially varying selection, which can, in turn, lead to local adaptation. Population genetic models have shown that the pattern of environmental variation in space can strongly influence the evolution of local adaptation. In particular, when environmental variation is highly autocorrelated in space local adaptation will more readily evolve. Despite this long-held prediction, the evolutionary genetic consequences of different patterns of environmental variation have not been thoroughly explored. In this study, simulations are used to model local adaptation to different patterns of environmental variation. The simulations confirm that local adaptation is expected to increase with the degree of spatial autocorrelation in the selective environment, but also show that highly heterogeneous environments are more likely to exhibit high variation in local adaptation, a result not previously described. Spatial autocorrelation in the environment also influences the evolution and genetic architecture of local adaptation, with different combinations of allele frequency and effect size arising under different patterns of environmental variation. These differences influence the ability to characterise the genetic basis of local adaptation in different environments. Finally, I analyse a large-scale provenance trial conducted on lodgepole pine and find suggestive evidence that spatially autocorrelated environmental variation leads to stronger local adaptation in natural populations of lodgepole pine. Overall, this work emphasizes the profound importance that the spatial pattern of selection can have on the evolution of local adaptation and how spatial autocorrelation should be considered when formulating hypotheses in ecological and genetic studies.\n\nLay SummaryMany species exhibit local adaptation to environmental variation across their ranges. Theoretical population genetics predicts that the evolution of local adaptation and patterns of genetic variation underlying it will be influenced by the spatial pattern of variation across a species range. However, this prediction has not been thoroughly explored for cases of complex heterogeneous landscapes. In this paper, I analyse simulations and empirical data to characterise the effects that the spatial pattern of environmental variation can have on the evolution of local adaptation and the genetics underlying it. From these analyses, I show that the pattern of environmental variation influences the average level of local adaptation, variation in local adaptation as well as the genetics underlying this important phenomenon.",

Among them, linguliform brachiopods are one of the key invertebrates that secrete calcium phosphate minerals to build their skeletons. One of the most distinct shell structures is the organo-phosphatic cylindrical column exclusive to phosphatic-shelled brachiopods, including both crown and stem groups. However, the complexity, diversity and biomineralization processes of these microscopic columns are far from clear in brachiopod ancestors. Here, exquisitely well-preserved columnar shell ultrastructures are reported for the first time in the earliest eoobolids. The hierarchical shell architectures, epithelial cell moulds, and the shape and size of cylindrical columns are scrutinised in Latusobolus xiaoyangbaensis gen. et sp. nov. and Eoobolus acutulus sp. nov from the Cambrian Series 2 Shuijingtuo Formation of South China. The secretion and construction of the stacked sandwich model of columnar architecture, which played a significant role in the evolution of linguliforms, is highly biologically controlled and organic-matrix mediated. Furthermore, a continuous transformation of anatomic features resulting from the growth of columnar shells is revealed between Eoobolidae, Lingulellotretidae and Acrotretida, shedding new light on the evolutionary growth and adaptive innovation of biomineralized columnar architecture among early phosphatic-shelled brachiopods during the Cambrian explosion.",

    "abstract": "Identification of the neuronal types that form the specialized circuits controlling distinct behaviors has benefited greatly from the simplicity offered by zebrafish. Electrophysiological studies have shown that additional to connectivity, understanding of circuitry requires identification of functional specializations among individual circuit components, such as those that regulate levels of transmitter release and neuronal excitability. In this study we use single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to identify the molecular bases for functional distinctions between motoneuron types that are causal to their differential roles in swimming. The primary motoneuron (PMn) in particular, expresses high levels of a unique combination of voltage-dependent ion channel types and synaptic proteins termed functional  cassettes. The ion channel types are specialized for promoting high frequency firing of action potentials and augmented transmitter release at the neuromuscular junction, both contributing to greater power generation. Our transcriptional profiling of spinal neurons further assigns expression of this cassette to specific interneuron types also involved in the central circuitry controlling high speed swimming and escape behaviors. Our analysis highlights the utility of scRNAseq in functional characterization of neuronal circuitry, in addition to providing a gene expression resource for studying cell type diversity.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutic resistance continues to impede overall survival rates for those affected by cancer. Although driver genes are associated with diverse cancer types, a scarcity of instrumental methods for predicting therapy response or resistance persists. Therefore, the impetus for designing predictive tools for therapeutic response is crucial and tools based on machine learning open new opportunities. Here, we present an easily accessible platform dedicated to Clear, Legible, Explainable, Transparent, and Elucidative (CLETE) yet wholly modifiable binary classification models. Our platform encompasses both unsupervised and supervised feature selection options, hyperparameter search methodologies, under-sampling and over-sampling methods, and normalization methods, along with fifteen machine learning algorithms. The platform furnishes a k-fold receiver operating curve (ROC) - area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy plots, permutation feature importance, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) plots, and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) plots to interpret the model and individual predictions. We have deployed a unique custom metric for hyperparameter search, which considers both training and validation scores, thus ensuring a check on under or over-fitting. Moreover, we introduce an innovative scoring method, NegLog2RMSL, which incorporates both training and test scores for model evaluation that facilitates the evaluation of models via multiple parameters. In a bid to simplify the user interface, we provide a graphical interface that sidesteps programming expertise and is compatible with both Windows and Mac OS. Platform robustness has been validated using pharmacogenomic data for 23 drugs across four diseases and holds the potential for utilization with any form of tabular data.",

    "abstract": "The neuromodulatory endocannabinoid system is a promising target for therapeutic interventions. One of the well-known behavioral effects of cannabinoid CB1 receptor activation with exogenous ligands such as THC is the inhibition of locomotor activity. However, the behavioral effects of endogenous cannabinoids are not understood. Enhancing endocannabinoid signaling offers an advantageous therapeutic strategy with limited cannabimimetic side effects, but their effects on motor function remain unclear. To reveal even the finest changes in motor function during voluntary locomotor tasks in mice, we adapted a high-speed, high-resolution marker-based motion capture, which so far has not been available in freely moving mice. Here we show that inhibition of distinct endocannabinoid metabolic pathways produces opposite effects on locomotor behavior that differ from those induced by exogenous cannabinoid receptor ligands. Selective upregulation of endocannabinoids 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) or N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA, anandamide) with inhibitors of their degradation (MJN110 and PF3845, respectively), produced bidirectional effects: MJN110 enhanced and PF3845 suppressed locomotor activity. Consistent differences in whole-body movement and precise step kinematics were found under distinct treatments, while analysis of locomotory episodes revealed invariant temporal microstructure, pointing towards motivational rather than motor-related mechanisms of action. The results show that the effects of manipulations of endocannabinoid system on locomotion are more diverse than previously assumed and result in distinct kinematic phenotypes.",

Current treatments for antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases target B cells or broadly suppress the immune system. However, pre-existing long-lived ASCs are often refractory to treatment, leaving a reservoir of autoreactive cells that continue to produce antibody. Therefore, the development of novel treatment methods targeting ASCs is vital to improve patient outcomes. Our objective was to test whether targeting the epigenetic regulator BMI-1 could deplete ASCs in autoimmune conditions in vivo and in vitro.\n\nMethodsUse of a BMI-1 inhibitor in both mouse and human autoimmune settings was investigated. Lyn-/- mice, a model of SLE, were treated with the BMI-1 small molecule inhibitor PTC-028, before assessment of ASCs, serum antibody and immune complexes. To examine human ASC survival, a novel human fibroblast-based assay was established, and the impact of PTC-028 on ASCs derived from Sjogrens syndrome patients evaluated.\n\nResultsBMI-1 inhibition significantly decreased splenic and bone marrow ASCs in Lyn-/-mice. The decline in ASCs was linked to aberrant cell cycle gene expression and led to a significant decrease in serum IgG3, immune complexes and anti-DNA IgG. PTC-028 was also efficacious in reducing ex vivo plasma cell survival from both Sjogrens syndrome patients and age-matched healthy donors.\n\nConclusionThese data provide evidence that inhibiting BMI-1 can deplete ASC in a variety of contexts and thus BMI-1 is a viable therapeutic target for antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases.",

Nucleosomes regulate the dynamic accessibility of chromatin and interact with the transcription machinery at every stage. Influences to steer nucleosome positioning are diverse, and the according importance of the DNA sequence in contrast to active chromatin remodeling has been subject of long discussion. In this study, we evaluate the functional role of DNA sequence for all major elements along the process of transcription. We developed a random forest classifier based on local DNA structure that assesses the sequence-intrinsic support for nucleosome positioning. On this basis, we created a simple data resource that we applied genome-wide to the human genome. In our comprehensive analysis, we found a special role of DNA in mediating the competition of nucleosomes with cis-regulatory elements, in enabling steady transcription, for positioning of stable nucleosomes in exons and for repelling nucleosomes during transcription termination. In contrast, we relate these findings to concurrent processes that generate strongly positioned nucleosomes in vivo that are not mediated by sequence, such as energy-dependent remodeling of chromatin.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/550795v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (45K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@46167corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16e6180org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c34758org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@180ea7d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

In our study, we employed metagenomic analysis and mass spectrometry techniques to investigate the fungal composition in CSD and its interaction with bacteria. We discovered that local fungal abnormalities in CSD can disrupt the stability of the bacterial population and the entire microbial community by altering bacterial abundance via specific metabolites. For instance, Lachnellula suecica reduces the abundance of several Lactobacillus spp., such as Lactobacillus jensenii, by diminishing the production of metabolites like Goyaglycoside A and Janthitrem E. Concurrently, Clavispora lusitaniae and Ophiocordyceps australis can synergistically impact the abundance of Lactobacillus spp. by modulating metabolite abundance.

Since tau accumulation in endothelial cells disrupts native microtubule stability, we reasoned that tau-induced microtubule destabilization would impair endothelial IP3-evoked Ca2+ signaling. We tested the hypothesis that tau disrupts the regulation of local cerebral blood flow by reducing endothelial cell Ca2+ signals and endothelial-dependent vasodilation. We used a pathogenic soluble tau peptide (T-peptide) model of tau aggregation and mice with genetically encoded endothelial Ca2+ sensors to measure cerebrovascular endothelial responses to tau exposure. T-peptide significantly attenuated endothelial Ca2+ activity and cortical capillary blood flow in vivo within 120 seconds. Further, T-peptide application constricted pressurized cerebral arteries and inhibited endothelium-dependent vasodilation. This study demonstrates that pathogenic tau alters cerebrovascular function through direct attenuation of endothelial Ca2+ signaling and endothelium-dependent vasodilation.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) identification of covalently ligandable sites may significantly accelerate targeted covalent inhibitor discoveries and expand the druggable proteome space. Here we report the development of the tree-based models and convolutional neural networks trained on a newly curated database (LigCys3D) of over 1,000 liganded cysteines in nearly 800 proteins represented by over 10,000 X-ray structures as reported in the protein data bank (PDB). The unseen tests yielded 94% AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve), demonstrating the highly predictive power of the models. Interestingly, application to the proteins evaluated by the activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) experiments in cell lines gave a lower AUC of 72%. Analysis revealed significant discrepancies in the structural environment of the ligandable cysteines captured by X-ray crystallography and those determined by ABPP. This surprising finding warrants further investigations and may have implications for future drug discoveries. We discuss ways to improve the models and project future directions. Our work represents a first step towards the ML-led integration of big genome data, structure models, and chemoproteomic experiments to annotate the human proteome space for the nextgeneration drug discoveries.",

    "abstract": "Mountain pine beetle (MPB) in Canada have spread well beyond their historical range. Accurate modelling of the long-term dynamics of MPB is critical for assessing the risk of further expansion and informing management strategies, particularly in the context of climate change and variable forest resilience. Most previous models have focused on capturing a single outbreak without tree replacement. While these models are useful for understanding MPB biology and outbreak dynamics, they cannot accurately model long-term forest dynamics. Past models that incorporate forest growth tend to simplify beetle dynamics. We present a new model that couples forest growth to MPB population dynamics and accurately captures key aspects of MPB biology, including a threshold for the number of beetles needed to overcome tree defenses and beetle aggregation that facilitates mass attacks. These mechanisms lead to a demographic Allee effect, which is known to be important in beetle population dynamics. We show that as forest resilience decreases, a fold bifurcation emerges and there is a stable fixed point with a non-zero MPB population. We derive conditions for the existence of this equilibrium. We then simulate biologically relevant scenarios and show that the beetle population approaches this equilibrium with transient boom and bust cycles with period related to the time of forest recovery. As forest resilience decreases, the Allee threshold also decreases. Thus, if host resilience decreases under climate change, for example under increased stress from drought, then the lower Allee threshold makes transient outbreaks more likely to occur in the future.\n\nStatements and DeclarationsO_ST_ABSCompeting interestsC_ST_ABSThe authors declare no competing interests.\n\nData availability statementData sharing is not applicable to this article as no datasets were generated or analysed during the current study.

We present a machine learning-based approach to predict prokaryotic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) by leveraging a vast dataset of 63,410 metagenomes and 87,920 microbial genomes. This led to the creation of AMPSphere, a comprehensive catalog comprising 863,498 non-redundant peptides, the majority of which were previously unknown. We observed that AMP production varies by habitat, with animal-associated samples displaying the highest proportion of AMPs compared to other habitats. Furthermore, within different human-associated microbiota, strain-level differences were evident. To validate our predictions, we synthesized and experimentally tested 50 AMPs, demonstrating their efficacy against clinically relevant drug-resistant pathogens both in vitro and in vivo. These AMPs exhibited antibacterial activity by targeting the bacterial membrane. Additionally, AMPSphere provides valuable insights into the evolutionary origins of peptides. In conclusion, our approach identified AMP sequences within prokaryotic microbiomes, opening up new avenues for the discovery of antibiotics.",

In this paper, we present new structural and algorithmic results concerning RAF sets, the identification of irreducible RAFs, and determining when certain reactions must occur before other reactions in a RAF (or, more generally, any F-generated set). We also describe how RAF theory extends to allow certain reactions to not require catalysis, and/or to require only catalysts that are not present in the food set, as well as to find minimal sets that are both a RAF and produce a given subset of elements. In all cases, the theory leads to efficient (polynomial-time) algorithms. We also briefly illustrate applications of RAF theory to two evolutionary processes in biology, namely, early metabolism and modelling the evolution of holobionts.",

    "abstract": "Chronic pancreatitis is a long-term inflammatory disease that results in irreversible scarring and a reduction in pancreatic function. This disease has multifactorial origins, involving both behavioral risks like diet, alcohol, and smoking, as well as genetic predispositions. One gene that has been implicated is CLDN2, which encodes claudin-2, a paracellular cation-selective channel localized at tight junctions. However, if and how claudin-2 may modify pancreatitis susceptibility have not been explored. We aimed to clarify the potential role of claudin-2 in the onset and progression of pancreatitis.\n\nWe employed multiple methodologies, including examining human pancreatic tissue, using the caerulein-induced experimental pancreatitis model, along with normal pancreatic ductal epithelial cell based organoid transport studies. In both human chronic pancreatitis tissues and in caerulein-induced experimental pancreatitis model, claudin-2 protein is significantly upregulated in pancreatic ductal epithelial cells. Genetically modified mice that lack claudin-2 expression develop more severe experimental pancreatitis, indicating claudin-2 plays a protective role in pancreatitis development. Our organoid based studies further demonstrate claudin-2 is critical for both sodium-dependent water transport and cAMP-dependent fluid secretion in pancreatic ductal epithelium. These findings suggest that intact claudin-2 function is essential for homeostatic and induced fluid transport, which could reduce pancreatitis severity by affecting pancreatic ductal secretion.\n\nIn conclusion, our studies suggest claudin-2 upregulation during pancreatitis may play a protective role for disease development and decreased claudin-2 function may increase pancreatitis severity. This points to the possibility of modulating pancreatic ductal claudin-2 function as an approach for pancreatitis therapy.",

    "abstract": "In pursuit of isolating novel anticancer proteases from environmental microbial isolates, we have purified and identified an extracellular metallo-protease from Bacillus altitudinis named Peptidase M84. This protease selectively triggered apoptosis in human ovarian adenocarcinoma cells (PA-1, SKOV3) and mouse ovarian carcinoma cells (ID8), in addition to exhibiting no significant effect on normal human epithelial ovarian cell (IOSE) and mouse peritoneal macrophage (PEM[FE]) cell viabilities. Protease activated receptor-1 (PAR-1); a GPCR which is reported to be overexpressed in ovarian cancer cells was identified as a novel target of Peptidase M84. We observed that Peptidase M84 induced PAR-1 overexpression along with activating its downstream signalling effectors NF{kappa}B and MAPK to promote excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in ovarian cancer cells. This disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential, allowed cytosolic release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, increased the Bax (pro-apoptotic) to Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic) ratio and promoted DNA damage to evoke apoptotic death of the ovarian cancer cells. Peptidase M84 also reduced nuclear ki-67 expression in these malignant cells to render an anti-proliferative role. In in vivo set-up, weekly intraperitoneal administration of Peptidase M84 (12 {micro}g/kg body-weight) in the ID8 mice model significantly diminished ascitic fluid accumulation through induction of oxidative stress, increasing murine survival rates by 60%. Collectively, our in vitro and in vivo findings suggested that Peptidase M84 triggered PAR-1 mediated oxidative stress to act as an apoptosis inducer in ovarian cancer cells. This established Peptidase M84 as a promising drug candidate for receptor mediated targeted-therapy of ovarian cancer.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=158 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/556500v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (51K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6b0a19org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1640510org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1888b49org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1708114_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Hydrogels have emerged as an important field of study in biomedical engineering, biomaterials research and soft tissue modeling due to their versatility and customizable structures. They are three-dimensional networks capable of absorbing significant amounts of water and can be chemically or physically bonded, rendering them insoluble. The unique properties of hydrogels, such as excellent biocompatibility, degradation abilities, and ability to form chemical bonds between macromolecules, make them valuable in a variety of applications. One of the main applications of hydrogels is tissue engineering, where they are used in implantation, surgical procedures, targeted drug delivery and tissue regeneration. Hydrogels can act as scaffolds to mimic the properties of natural tissues, including mechanical strength, degradation properties, gel transformation, and swelling. Crosslinking hydrogels with other polymers, both natural and synthetic, allows their degradation rate to be controlled. Composite hydrogels or biohybrid gels offer advantages such as consistent properties between batches and a high degree of control in the manufacturing process. Using different types of polymers, researchers can fine-tune the chemical and physical properties of the resulting hydrogel, which is crucial for certain biomedical applications such as drug delivery, biocompatibility, and mechanical stability. In this study, our aim is to make hybrid hydrogel scaffolds more suitable for biomedical applications, which can show the healing effect of adding natural polymers to the scaffold structure. Our results revealed that the hybrid hydrogel obtained by chemically linking gelatin polymer chains to PEG polymers during crosslinking via UV light provides more advantageous properties in the final hydrogel structure, such as better durability and pore sizes for future cell placement in tissue engineering applications.",

This requires that we flexibly integrate and focus on different object properties to support specific behavioral goals. In the current study, we examined how these rich object representations unfold in the human brain by modelling time-resolved MEG signals evoked by viewing thousands of objects. Using millions of behavioral judgments to guide our understanding of the neural representation of the object space, we find distinct temporal profiles across the object dimensions. These profiles fell into two broad types with either a distinct and early peak ([~]150 ms) or a slow rise to a late peak ([~]300 ms). Further, the early effects are stable across participants in contrast to later effects which show more variability across people. This highlights that early peaks may carry stimulus-specific and later peaks subject-specific information. Given that the dimensions with early peaks seem to be primarily visual dimensions and those with later peaks more conceptual, our results suggest that conceptual processing is more variable across people. Together, these data provide a comprehensive account of how a variety of object properties unfold in the human brain and contribute to the rich nature of object vision.",

Deletion of p63 results in extensive neuroendocrine differentiation in the developing mouse esophagus and esophageal progenitors derived from human embryonic stem cells.

Upregulation of the major p63 isoform {Delta}Np63, through either ectopic expression or EZH2 inhibition, promotes squamous transdifferentiation of eNEC cells.

    "abstract": "Mutations in the human AAA-ATPase VPS4 isoform, VPS4A, cause severe Neurodevelopmental defects and Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia (CDA). VPS4 is a crucial component of the ESCRT system, which drives membrane remodeling in numerous cellular processes, including receptor degradation, cell division, and neural pruning. Notably, while most organisms encode for a single VPS4 gene, human cells have two VPS4 paralogs, namely VPS4A and VPS4B, but the functional differences between these paralogs is mostly unknown. Here, we set out to investigate the role of the human VPS4 paralogs in cytokinetic abscission using a series of knockout cell lines. We found that VPS4A and VPS4B hold both overlapping and distinct roles in abscission. VPS4A depletion resulted in a severe abscission delay, which was fully rescued by VPS4A expression but only partially rescued by VPS4B overexpression. Unexpectedly, expressing a monomeric-locked VPS4A mutant also partially rescued the abscission delay in VPS4A KO cells and bound the abscission checkpoint proteins CHMP4C and ANCHR. Depletion of VTA1, a co-factor of VPS4, disrupted VPS4A- ANCHR interactions and accelerated abscission, indicating a role for VTA1 in the abscission checkpoint. Our findings reveal a dual role for VPS4A in abscission, one that is canonical and can be compensated by VPS4B, and another that is regulatory and is mediated by its monomeric form. These observations provide a potential mechanistic explanation for the neurodevelopmental defects and other related disorders reported in VPS4A-mutated patients with a fully functional VPS4B paralog.",

However, the cellular mechanism for droplet formation is poorly understood. Here, we expressed OptoTau, a P301L mutant tau fused with CRY2olig, a light-sensitive protein that can form homo-oligomers. Under blue light exposure, OptoTau increased tau phosphorylation and was sequestered in aggresomes. Suppressing aggresome formation by nocodazole formed tau granular clusters in the cytoplasm. The granular clusters disappeared by discontinuing blue light exposure or 1,6-hexanediol treatment suggesting that intracellular tau droplet formation requires microtubule collapse. Expressing OptoTau-{Delta}N, a species of N-terminal cleaved tau observed in the Alzheimers disease brain, formed 1,6-hexanediol and detergent-resistant tau clusters in the cytoplasm with blue light stimulation. This intracellular stable tau clusters acted as a seed for tau fibrils in vitro. These results suggest that tau droplet formation and N-terminal cleavage are necessary for neurofibrillary tangles formation in neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with Junctional Epidermolysis Bullosa (JEB), a rare genetic skin disease characterised by loss of function mutations in the Laminin332 (Lam332), do not survive beyond their first birthday. Here we report that loss of Lam332 leads to absence of cholesterol lipid from the epidermis in vitro and in vivo. Stable knockdown of Lam332 chains (LAMA3, LAMB3 and LAMC2) was established using shRNA and were used to develop 3D skin equivalents. Changes in lipid synthesis were assessed by western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Findings were confirmed in an inducible mouse model of Lam3 (Lama3flox/flox/K14CreERT) and in anonymized, archival human tissue: JEB skin and normal age-matched controls. Further lipid analysis was explored using lipidomics in 3D skin equivalents and mouse tissue. Cholesterol biosynthesis genes were increased with loss of Lam332 in vitro, however a decrease in nile red lipid staining was observed in Lam3 mouse (n = 6) and in JEB patient skin (n = 7). Further changes to the epidermal lipid profile with loss of Lam332 was confirmed with lipidomic analysis of Lam3 mouse epidermis and Lam332 skin equivalents. Cholesterol transport within Lam332 KD keratinocytes was revealed to be disrupted, which in keratinocytes is dependent on the actomyosin network, which was reversed with recombinant human Lam332. In conclusion these findings suggest a role for Lam332 in lipid metabolism in the skin and a broader role in epidermal homeostasis and barrier formation. Restoration of cholesterol transport in JEB patients offers the potential to improve the skin barrier and survival.",

    "abstract": "Uterine luminal fluid (ULF) composition plays a major role in cell-to-cell communication between the receptive endometrium and an invading blastocyst. ULF is made up of secretions from the uterine glands and uterine epithelial cells (UEC). However, the cellular mechanisms regulating these exocytotic secretions are not yet understood. This study investigated the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) during early pregnancy using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). TEM analysis at time of fertilisation (TOF) Day 1 and at time of receptivity (TOR) Day 5.5 revealed EVs present, with an abundance at TOR. Exocytosis signalling in UECs, by SNARE proteins syntaxin 2 (syn2) and SNAP23, was also examined. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed both syn2 and SNAP23 to be present in the apical area of UECs at TOR. Western blot and immunofluorescence quantification revealed a significant increase in syn2 and SNAP23 at TOR compared to TOF. SNAP23 colocalization with apical actin showed SNAP23 was in the luminal space contributing to ULF. Overall, this data shows EVs, syn2 and SNAP23 (potential receptivity marker) are present in ULF and may together create a favourable microenvironment for blastocyst implantation.\n\nSummary statementDuring uterine receptivity SNAREs participate in the secretion of ULF. EVs and SNAP23 are present in the uterine luminal space during uterine receptivity. SNAP23 has the potential to be used as a receptivity marker.",

    "abstract": "Universities benefit from recruiting and retaining diverse students, as it leads to more creative and rigorous problem solving. Efforts to improve the diversity, equity, and inclusion of graduate education have historically been focused on recruitment but are now shifting to retaining enrolled students. A low percentage of doctoral students, particularly those from historically underrepresented groups (URGs), complete their PhD within 10 years. To increase support of incoming doctoral students from URGs, UCLA established the Competitive Edge (CE) bridge program. CE provides six weeks of professional development and research training at the start of the PhD program. We surveyed 55+ first-year doctoral students (14 CE students, eight non-CE students from URGs, and 34 well-represented (WR) students) in STEM fields to understand CEs effectiveness. We found that the CE program aided students in four areas that influence graduate student attrition: mentor/mentee relationship, socialization, finances, and preparedness. At the end of their first academic year, CE students reported that the program helped them in multiple areas relating to student success, such as mental wellbeing and sense of belonging. CE students reported a larger mean growth in seven of eight skills needed in graduate school compared to NonCE URG and WR students. Short answer responses revealed that NonCE students wished for more support in areas covered by the CE program, such as managing advising relationships and protecting mental health. Additionally, CE students received significant funding during the program. The CE programs successful model at UCLA can be adapted to improve support for underrepresented doctoral students at other institutions.",

    "abstract": "Neocortical pyramidal neurons are frequently myelinated. Diversity in the topography of axonal myelination in the cerebral cortex has been attributed to a combination of electrophysiological activity, axonal morphology, and neuronal-glial interactions. Previously, we showed that axonal segment length and calibre are critical determinants of fast-spiking interneuron myelination (Stedehouder, J. et al (2019). However, the factors that determine the myelination of individual axonal segments along neocortical pyramidal neurons remain largely unexplored. Here, we used structured illumination microscopy and cell type-specific manipulations to examine the extent to which axonal morphology determines the topography of axonal myelination in mouse neocortical pyramidal neurons. We found that, unlike what was determined for fast-spiking interneurons, the joint combination of axonal calibre and interbranch distance does not predict axonal myelination in pyramidal neurons, rather it provides a minimum threshold for myelination; pyramidal neurons with an axon calibre and interbranch distance lower than 0.24 {micro}m and 19 {micro}m, respectively, are almost never myelinated. Moreover, we further confirmed that these findings in mice also extend to human neocortical pyramidal cell myelination, suggesting that this mechanism is evolutionarily conserved. Taken together, our findings suggest that axonal morphology is highly deterministic of the topography and cell-type specificity of neocortical myelination.",

    "abstract": "During viral infections, type I interferons (IFN) are induced and play a key role in counteracting initial viral spread. Twelve different human IFN subtypes exist that bind the same receptor; however, they elicit unique host responses and display distinct potencies of antiviral activities. Our previous studies on HIV and HBV demonstrated that the clinically used IFN2 is not the most effective one among the IFN subtypes. By sequence modeling, we identified a region in helix B with mainly conserved residues at the outside facing IFNAR1, but variable residues at the inside facing the core of IFN, potentially representing a putative tunable anchor to tune pleiotropic IFN responses. Using site-directed mutagenesis various mutations were introduced into the IFN2b backbone targeting sites which are important for binding to IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, the putative tunable anchor, or outside these three regions. Selected mutations were based on sequence differences to high antiviral subtypes IFN6 and IFN14. Treatment assays against HBV and HIV identified several critical residues for the antiviral activity of IFN mainly in the IFNAR1 binding region. Combined mutations of the IFN2 IFNAR1/2 binding sites or the IFNAR1 binding region plus the putative tunable anchor by those of IFN14 further augmented activation of different downstream signaling cascades providing a molecular correlate for the enhanced antiviral activity. We describe here important functional residues within IFN subtype molecules, which enabled us to design novel and innovative drugs that may have the potential to be used in clinical trials against a variety of different viral infections.\n\nImportanceThe potency of IFN to restrict viruses was already discovered in 1957. However, until today only IFN2 out of the 12 distinct human IFN subtypes has been therapeutically used against chronic viral infections. There is convincing evidence that other IFN subtypes are far more efficient than IFN2 against many viruses. In order to identify critical antiviral residues within the IFN subtype sequence, we designed hybrid molecules based on the IFN2 backbone with individual sequence motifs from the more potent subtypes IFN6 and IFN14. In different antiviral assays with HIV or HBV, residues binding to IFNAR1 as well as combinations of residues in the IFNAR1 binding region, the putative tunable anchor, and residues outside these regions were identified to be crucial for the antiviral activity of IFN. Thus, we designed artificial IFN molecules, based on the clinically approved IFN2 backbone, but with highly improved antiviral activity against several viruses.",

    "abstract": "Listeria monocytogenes is a significant concern for the food industry due to its ability to persist in the food processing environment. Decreased susceptibility to disinfectants is one of the factors that contribute to the persistence of L. monocytogenes. The objective of this study was to explore the diversity of L. monocytogenes susceptibility to quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) using 1,671 L. monocytogenes isolates. This was used to determine the phenotype-genotype concordance and characterize genomes of the QAC sensitive and tolerant isolates for stress resistance, virulence and plasmid replicon genes. Distribution of QAC tolerance genes among 37,897 publicly available L. monocytogenes genomes were also examined. The minimum inhibitory concentration to QACs was determined by the broth microdilution method and non-sequenced isolates (n=1,244) were whole genome sequenced. Genotype-phenotype concordance was 99% for benzalkonium chloride, DDAC and a commercial QAC based sanitizer. Prevalence of QAC tolerance genes was 23% and 28% in our L. monocytogenes collection and in the global dataset, respectively. qacH was the most prevalent gene in our collection (61%), with 19% prevalence in the global dataset. Notably, bcrABC was most common (72%) globally, while 25% in our collection. Prevalence of emrC and emrE was comparable in both datasets, 7% and 2%, respectively. Replicon genes, indicative of plasmid harborage, were detected in 44% of the isolates and associated with the QAC tolerant phenotype. The presented analysis is based on the biggest L. monocytogenes collection in diversity and quantity for characterization of the L. monocytogenes QAC tolerance at both phenotypic and genomic levels.\n\nIMPORTANCEContamination of Listeria monocytogenes within the food processing environment is of concern to the food industry due to challenges in eradicating the pathogen once it becomes persistent in the environment. Genetic markers associated with increased tolerance to disinfectants have been identified, which alongside factors favor the persistence of L. monocytogenes in the production environment. By employing a comprehensive large-scale phenotypic testing and genomic analysis our study significantly enhances the understanding of the prevalence of quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) tolerant L. monocytogenes and the genetic determinants associated with the increased tolerance. Furthermore, we report on the prevalence of QAC tolerance genes among 37,897 publicly available L. monocytogenes sequences and their distribution within clonal complexes, isolation sources and geographical locations. As the propagation of QAC tolerance showed not be evenly distributed globally this highlights that understanding the development of L. monocytogenes disinfectant tolerance can be monitored using publicly available WGS data.",

    "abstract": "The human scalp hosts an unusually low diversity microbiota dominated by three species: Cutibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Malassezia restricta, where characteristic shifts in species frequencies are associated with seborrheic dermatitis and dandruff. In order to better understand this important community, here we study the ecological interactions between these scalp species. We establish a new experimental model system that supports the growth of all three species in vitro and allows one to selectively enumerate each species from co-culture. Our work reveals the potential for strong ecological interactions within the scalp community. In particular, C. acnes greatly benefits from the presence of M. restricta, but harms it in return (exploitation), while S. epidermidis suppresses both M. restricta and C. acnes. Our data suggest that the shifts in composition seen in compromised scalps are influenced by ecological interactions between species. We argue that the scalp microbiome should be viewed as an ecological system where species interactions have the potential to contribute to health outcomes.\n\nImportanceOur bodies are home to diverse communities of microorganisms, our microbiome, which can be critical for health and wellbeing. The human scalp hosts a relatively simple community dominated by three species: two bacteria, Cutibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis, and one fungus, Malassezia restricta. Both dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis are strongly associated with characteristic shifts in the frequencies of these three species. However, how these species affect one another and behave as a community remains poorly understood. Here, we develop a simple experimental system to empirically study how these three species interact and affect one another for the first time. We find that S. epidermidis greatly suppresses the growth of the other species, while C. acnes specifically exploits M. restricta. Our work suggests that the human scalp is an ecological system in which species interactions have the potential to affect health outcomes.",

Video microscopy has shown that in most infections lysis occurs as a sudden, explosive event at a cell pole, such that the initial product is a less refractile ghost that retains rod-shaped morphology. Here, we investigate the molecular basis of polar lysis using time lapse fluorescence microscopy. The results indicate that the holin determines the morphology of lysis by suddenly forming two-dimensional rafts at the poles about 100 seconds prior to lysis. Given the physiological and biochemical similarities between the lambda holin and other class I holins, dynamic redistribution and sudden concentration may be common features of holins, probably reflecting the fitness advantage of all-or-nothing lysis regulation.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 variants with undetermined properties have emerged intermittently throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Some variants possess unique phenotypes and mutations which allow further characterization of viral evolution and spike functions. Around 1100 cases of the B.1.640.1 variant were reported in Africa and Europe between 2021 and 2022, before the expansion of Omicron. Here, we analyzed the biological properties of a B.1.640.1 isolate and its spike. Compared to the ancestral spike, B.1.640.1 carried 14 amino acid substitutions and deletions. B.1.640.1 escaped binding by some anti-NTD and -RBD monoclonal antibodies, and neutralization by sera from convalescent and vaccinated individuals. In cell lines, infection generated large syncytia and a high cytopathic effect. In primary airway cells, B.1.640.1 replicated less than Omicron BA.1 and triggered more syncytia and cell death than other variants. The B.1.640.1 spike was highly fusogenic when expressed alone. This was mediated by two poorly characterized and infrequent mutations located in the spike S2 domain, T859N and D936H. Altogether, our results highlight the cytopathy of a hyper-fusogenic SARS-CoV-2 variant, supplanted upon the emergence of Omicron BA.1.\n\nImportanceOur results highlight the plasticity of SARS-CoV-2 spike to generate highly fusogenic and cytopathic strains with the causative mutations being uncharacterized in previous variants.

These unique properties are tightly regulated and controlled by complex genetic and molecular mechanisms whose understanding is essential for both basic and translational research. A large number of studies have mostly focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms governing pluripotency and differentiation of ESCs, while the regulation of proliferation has received comparably less attention. In mouse ESCs, pluripotency and proliferation can be independent processes meaning that it is possible for mouse ESCs to maintain their pluripotent state without actively proliferating. Here, we investigate the role of ZZZ3 (Zinc Finger ZZ-Type Containing 3) function in human ESCs homeostasis. We found that knockdown of ZZZ3 strongly decreases ribosome biogenesis, translation, and mTOR signaling leading to nucleolar stress and significant reduction of cell proliferation. This process occurs without affecting pluripotency, suggesting that ZZZ3-depleted ESCs enter a dormant-like state and that proliferation and pluripotency can be uncoupled also in human ESCs.",

However, the molecular mechanisms involved in regeneration remain unclear. We conducted a transcriptomic analysis of juvenile axolotls limbs and their blastema and compared the results with aged axolotls that failed to regenerate after amputation. We identified a set of genes involved in cell differentiation, transcriptional regulation, cartilage development, bone morphogenesis, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Four highly expressed genes (FSTL1, ADAMTS17, GPX7, and CTHRC1) were identified in regenerating tissue, but underexpressed in aged axolotls. Structural and homology analysis showed that these genes are conserved and have important roles in development, bone morphogenesis, and cartilage formation. Our findings propose a novel set of axolotl genes involved in tissue regeneration that could be a starting point for further studies in other vertebrates.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=125 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/556684v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11184f5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13023a3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@173ac2corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12c9c38_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The colonial-period arrival of Europeans in southern Africa is associated with strong sex-biased migration by which male settlers displaced indigenous Khoekhoe and San men. Simultaneously, the importation of South Asian, Indonesian and Eastern African slaves may have contributed female-biased migration to Cape Town and surrounding areas. We examine the spatial and temporal spread of sex-biased migration from the Cape northward into Namaqualand and the southern Kalahari using genetic data from more than 1,400 individuals. In all regions, admixture patterns were sex-biased, with evidence of a greater male contribution of European ancestry and greater female contribution of Khoe-San ancestry. While admixture among Khoe-San, European, equatorial African, and Asian groups has likely been continuous from the founding of Cape Town to present-day, we find that Khoe-San groups further north experienced a single pulse of European admixture 6-8 generations ago. European admixture was followed by additional Khoe-San gene flow, potentially reflecting an aggregation of indigenous groups due to disruption by colonial interlopers. Male migration into the northern frontier territories was not a homogenous group of expanding Afrikaners and slaves. The Nama show evidence of distinct founder effects and derive 15% of their male lineages from Asian men, a pattern absent in the =Khomani San. Khoe-San ancestry from the paternal line is greatly diminished in populations from Cape Town, the Cederberg Mountains and Upington, but remains more frequent in self-identified ethnically indigenous groups. Strikingly, we estimate that Khoe-San Y-chromosomes were experiencing unprecedented population growth at the time of European arrival. Our findings shed light on the patterns of admixture and the population history of South Africa as the colonial frontier expanded.",

    "abstract": "PRDM9-mediated reproductive isolation was first described in the progeny of Mus musculus musculus (MUS) PWD/Ph and Mus musculus domesticus (DOM) C57BL/6J inbred strains. These male F1-hybrids fail to complete chromosome synapsis and arrest meiosis at prophase I, due to incompatibilities between the Prdm9 gene and hybrid sterility locus Hstx2. We identified fourteen alleles of Prdm9 in Exon 12, encoding the DNA-binding domain of the PRDM9 protein in outcrossed wild mouse populations from Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, eight of which are novel. The same Prdm9 allele was found in all mice bearing introgressed t-haplotypes, encompassing Prdm9 and inversions preventing recombination with wildtype Chr 17. We asked whether seven novel Prdm9 alleles in MUS populations and the t-haplotype allele in one MUS and three DOM populations induce Prdm9-mediated reproductive isolation. The results show that only combinations of the dom2 allele of DOM origin and the MUS msc1 allele ensure complete infertility of intersubspecific hybrids outside the context of inbred mouse strains. The results further indicate that the erasure of PRDM9 msc1 binding motifs may be shared by MUS mice from populations with different Prdm9 alleles, implicating that erased PRDM9 binding motifs may be uncoupled from their corresponding PRDM9 zinc finger arrays at the population level. Our data corroborate the model of Prdm9-mediated hybrid sterility beyond inbred strains of mice and suggest that sterility alleles of Prdm9 may be rare.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotic cells, phosphorus is assimilated and utilized primarily as phosphate (Pi). Pi homeostasis is mediated by transporters that have not yet been adequately characterized in green algae. This study reports on CrPHT4-7 from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a member of the PHT4 transporter family, which exhibits remarkable similarity to AtPHT4;4 from Arabidopsis thaliana, a chloroplastic ascorbate transporter. Using fluorescent protein tagging we show that CrPHT4-7 resides in the chloroplast envelope membrane. Crpht4-7 mutants, generated by the CRISPR/Cas12a-mediated single-strand templated repair, show retarded growth especially in high light, enhanced sensitivity to phosphorus limitation, reduced ATP level, strong ascorbate accumulation and diminished non-photochemical quenching in high light. Conversely, CrPHT4-7 overexpressing lines exhibit enhanced biomass accumulation under high light conditions in comparison with the wild-type strain. Expressing CrPHT4-7 in a yeast strain lacking Pi transporters substantially recovered its slow growth phenotype demonstrating that it transports Pi. Even though CrPHT4-7 shows a high degree of similarity to AtPHT4;4, it does not display any significant ascorbate transport activity in yeast or intact algal cells. Thus, the results demonstrate that CrPHT4-7 functions as a chloroplastic Pi transporter essential for maintaining Pi homeostasis and photosynthesis in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.\n\nOne-sentence summaryWe demonstrate that the CrPHT4-7 transporter of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is located in the chloroplast envelope membrane and contributes to maintaining phosphate homeostasis and photosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "During nutrient scarcity, plants can adapt their developmental strategy to maximize their chance of survival. Such plasticity in development is underpinned by hormonal regulation, which mediates the relationship between environmental cues and developmental outputs. In legumes, endosymbiosis with nitrogen fixing bacteria (rhizobia) is a key adaptation for supplying the plant with nitrogen in the form of ammonium. Rhizobia are housed in lateral root-derived organs termed nodules that maintain an environment conducive to Nitrogenase in these bacteria. Several phytohormones are important for regulating the formation of nodules, with both positive and negative roles proposed for gibberellin (GA). In this study, we determined the cellular location and function of bioactive GA during nodule organogenesis using a genetically-encoded second generation GA biosensor, GPS2. We found endogenous bioactive GA accumulates locally at the site of nodule primordia, increasing dramatically in the cortical cell layers, persisting through cell divisions and maintaining accumulation in the mature nodule meristem. We show, through mis-expression of GA catabolic enzymes that suppress GA accumulation, that GA acts as a positive regulator of nodule growth and development. Furthermore, increasing or decreasing GA through perturbation of biosynthesis gene expression can increase or decrease the size of nodules, respectively. This is unique from lateral root formation, a developmental program that shares common organogenesis regulators. We link GA to a wider gene regulatory program by showing that cytokinin as well as nodule-identity genes induce and sustain GA accumulation necessary for nodule function.",

    "abstract": "The formation of an organized body requires the establishment and maintenance of cells with structural and functional distinctive characteristics. A central question in developmental biology is how changes in the regulation of genes drive cell specification and patterning1. microRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate development through mRNA cleavage and/or translational repression2. In plants, miRNAs regulate key aspects including growth, development, stem cell maintenance, vegetative phase change, leaf morphogenesis, floral organ formation and flowering time3. Biogenesis of plant miRNAs depends on the activity of DICER-LIKE 1 (DCL1), an RNase type III endonuclease that processes double stranded RNA to give rise to mature miRNAs 4. The genomes of todays flora contain at least one bona fide copy of DCL1 5,6. Using Marchantia polymorpha -a model bryophyte that allows comparative approaches to infer characteristics of the ancestral land plant-, we demonstrate that MpDCL1a is required for the biogenesis of miRNAs and uncovered a central role for miR166/Homeodomain Zipper Class III-regulated auxin synthesis in the specification of cell identity, patterning, meristem function, laminar expansion and the development of the body in the last common ancestor of extant land plants.",

Breeding for potato resistance to P. infestans has focused on the use of NLRs, however, these genes are typically quickly overcome since the matching avirulence genes evolve exceptionally quickly. Here, we stacked two PRRs, PERU and RLP23, that recognize the rather conserved Phytophthora PAMPs Pep-13/25 and nlp20, respectively, in the potato cultivar Atlantic, and evaluated their effect on P. infestans resistance. We found that PERU and RLP23 cooperate for the early immune responses like the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and production of ethylene by recognizing their corresponding PAMPs. Furthermore, we show that potato plants overexpressing these two PRRs are slightly less affected by P. infestans compared to the single transformants. Together, our data suggest that pyramiding of surface receptors can provide additional enhanced resistance against pathogens, however, more effective or synergistic combinations that may include intracellular NLR receptors should be explored.",

    "abstract": "While our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and antibody responses following infection and vaccination has improved tremendously since the outbreak in 2019, the sequence identities and relative abundances of the individual constituent antibody molecules in circulation remain understudied. Using Ig-Seq, we proteomically profiled the serological repertoire specific to the whole ectodomain of SARS-CoV-2 prefusion-stabilized spike (S) as well as to the receptor binding domain (RBD) over a 6-month period in four subjects following SARS-CoV-2 infection before SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were available. In each individual, we identified between 59 and 167 unique IgG clonotypes in serum. To our surprise, we discovered that [~]50% of serum IgG specific for RBD did not recognize prefusion-stabilized S (referred to as iso-RBD antibodies), suggesting that a significant fraction of serum IgG targets epitopes on RBD inaccessible on the prefusion-stabilized conformation of S. On the other hand, the abundance of iso-RBD antibodies in nine individuals who received mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines encoding prefusion-stabilized S was significantly lower ([~]8%). We expressed a panel of 12 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that were abundantly present in serum from two SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, and their binding specificities to prefusion-stabilized S and RBD were all in agreement with the binding specificities assigned based on the proteomics data, including 1 iso-RBD mAb which bound to RBD but not to prefusion-stabilized S. 2 of 12 mAbs demonstrated neutralizing activity, while other mAbs were non-neutralizing. 11 of 12 mAbs also bound to S (B.1.351), but only 1 maintained binding to S (B.1.1.529). This particular mAb binding to S (B.1.1.529) 1) represented an antibody lineage that comprised 43% of the individuals total S-reactive serum IgG binding titer 6 months post-infection, 2) bound to the S from a related human coronavirus, HKU1, and 3) had a high somatic hypermutation level (10.9%), suggesting that this antibody lineage likely had been elicited previously by pre-pandemic coronavirus and was re-activated following the SARS-CoV-2 infection. All 12 mAbs demonstrated their ability to engage in Fc-mediated effector function activities. Collectively, our study provides a quantitative overview of the serological repertoire following SARS-CoV-2 infection and the significant contribution of iso-RBD antibodies, demonstrating how vaccination strategies involving prefusion-stabilized S may have reduced the elicitation of iso-RBD serum antibodies which are unlikely to contribute to protection.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus with neurological complications including loss of smell and taste, headache, and confusion that can persist for months or longer. Severe neuronal cell damage has also been reported in some cases. The objective of this study was to compare the infectivity of Wild-type, Delta, and Omicron variants in transgenic mice that express the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor under the control of the keratin 18 promoter (K18) and characterize the progression of infection and inflammatory response in the lung and brain of these animals.\n\nMethodsK18-hACE2 female mice were intranasally infected with Wild-type, Delta, or Omicron variants and euthanized either at 3 days post-infection (dpi) or at the humane endpoint. None of the animals infected with the Omicron variant reached the humane endpoint and were euthanized at day 8 dpi. Virological and immunological analyses were performed in the lungs, olfactory bulbs, medulla oblongata, and brains.\n\nResultsWe established that Wild-type, Delta, and Omicron infect the lung and brain of K18-hACE2 mice. At 3 dpi, mice infected with the Omicron variant show lower levels of viral RNA than those infected with Wild-type or Delta in the lung and brain. However, they still demonstrate upregulation of cytokines and chemokines, indicating that the Omicron variant can induce pulmonary and neuronal inflammation despite reduced viral proliferation after infection. At the humane endpoint/8dpi, there is a significant increase in viral RNA in mice infected with the Wild-type or Delta variant brains. However, viral RNA levels in Omicron-infected mice did not increase significantly as compared to 3dpi, and the expression of cytokines and chemokines in the brain, olfactory bulb, and medulla oblongata was downregulated, suggesting that infection by the Omicron variant results in attenuated neuroinflammation as compared with Wild-type and Delta.",

    "abstract": "Antiviral surface coatings are under development to prevent viral fomite transmission from high-traffic touch surfaces in public spaces. Coppers antiviral properties have been widely documented; but the antiviral mechanism of copper surfaces is not fully understood. We screened a series of metal and metal oxide surfaces for antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Copper and copper oxide surfaces exhibited superior anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity; however, level of antiviral activity was dependent upon the composition of the carrier solution used to deliver virus inoculum. We demonstrate that copper ions released into solution from test surfaces can mediate virus inactivation, indicating a copper ion dissolution-dependent antiviral mechanism. Level of antiviral activity is, however, not dependent on the amount of copper ions released into solution per se. Instead, our findings suggest that degree of virus inactivation is dependent upon copper ion complexation with other biomolecules (e.g., proteins/metabolites) in the virus carrier solution that compete with viral components. Although using tissue culture-derived virus inoculum is experimentally convenient to evaluate the antiviral activity of copper-derived test surfaces, we propose that the high organic content of tissue culture medium reduces the availability of \"uncomplexed\" copper ions to interact with the virus, negatively affecting virus inactivation and hence surface antiviral performance. We propose that laboratory antiviral surface testing should include virus delivered in a physiologically relevant carrier solution (saliva or nasal secretions when testing respiratory viruses) to accurately predict real-life surface antiviral performance when deployed in public spaces.\n\nImportanceThe purpose of evaluating antiviral activity of test surfaces in the laboratory is to identify surfaces that will perform efficiently in preventing fomite transmission when deployed on high-traffic touch surfaces in public spaces. The conventional method in laboratory testing is to use tissue culture-derived virus inoculum, however this study demonstrates that antiviral performance of test copper-containing surfaces is dependent on the composition of the carrier solution in which the virus inoculum is delivered to test surfaces. Therefore, we recommend that laboratory surface testing should include virus delivered in a physiologically relevant carrier solution, to accurately predict real-life test surface performance in public spaces. Understanding the mechanism of virus inactivation is key to future rational design of improved antiviral surfaces. Here, we demonstrate that copper ions released from copper surfaces into small liquid droplets containing SARS-CoV-2, is a mechanism by which the virus that causes COVID-19 can be inactivated.",

    "abstract": "The rapid emergence of diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants, notably the Omicron variant, poses challenges to vaccine development. Here, we present a noncleaved, nonfusogenic spike (S) protein eliciting robust B- and T-cell immune responses against Omicron BA.5. The antigen incorporates the R685S and R815A mutations, effectively preventing the shedding of the S1 subunit and eliminating fusogenic activity of the resulting S antigen, termed S(SA). Through reverse genetic analysis, we found that the noncleaved form S protein with the R685S mutation enhances ACE2-dependent viral entry in vitro compared to the wild-type S protein, without increasing the virulence of the mutant virus in mice. The mRNA vaccine encoding the Omicron BA.4/5 S(SA) antigen conferred protective immunity in mice following two doses of 1 g {Psi}-UTP- or UTP-incorporated mRNA vaccines. Despite a roughly 6-fold reduction in neutralizing potency, both mRNA vaccines exhibited broad neutralizing efficacy against Omicron subvariants, including the XBB lineage variants XBB.1.5 and XBB.1.16.",

We sequenced B- and T-cell receptor repertoires (BCR/TCR) from the blood of 251 infectees, vaccinees, and controls to investigate whether features of these repertoires could predict subjects SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titer (NAbs), as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We sequenced recombined immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IGH), TCR{beta} (TRB), and TCR{delta} (TRD) genes in parallel from all subjects, including select B- and T-cell subsets in most cases, with a focus on their hypervariable CDR3 regions, and correlated this AIRRseq data with demographics and clinical findings from subjects electronic health records. We found that age affected NAb levels in vaccinees but not infectees. Intriguingly, we found that vaccination, but not infection, has a substantial effect on non-productively recombined IGHs, suggesting a vaccine effect that precedes clonal selection. We found that repertoires binding capacity to known SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ TRBs performs as well as the best hand-tuned fuzzy matching at predicting a protective level of NAbs, while also being more robust to repertoire sample size and not requiring hand-tuning. The overall conclusion from this large, unbiased, clinically well annotated dataset is that B- and T-cell adaptive responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination are surprising, subtle, and diffuse. We discuss methodological and statistical challenges faced in attempting to define and quantify such strong-but-diffuse repertoire signatures and present tools and strategies for addressing these challenges.",

    "abstract": "The highly mutated BA.2.86, with over 30 spike protein mutations in comparison to Omicron BA.2 and XBB.1.5 variants, has raised concerns about its potential to evade COVID-19 vaccination or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection-elicited immunity. In this study, we employ a live SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay to compare the neutralization evasion ability of BA.2.86 with other emerged SARS-CoV-2 subvariants, including BA.2-derived CH.1.1, Delta-Omicron recombinant XBC.1.6, and XBB descendants XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, XBB.2.3, EG.5.1 and FL.1.5.1. Our results show that BA.2.86 is less neutralization evasive than XBB sublineages. Among all the tested variants, CH.1.1 exhibits the greatest neutralization evasion. In comparison to XBB.1.5, the more recent XBB descendants, particularly EG.5.1 and FL.1.5.1, display increased resistance to neutralization induced by parental COVID-19 mRNA vaccine and a BA.5-Bivalent-booster. In contrast, XBC.1.6 shows a slight reduction but remains comparable sensitivity to neutralization when compared to BA.5. Furthermore, a recent XBB.1.5-breakthrough infection significantly enhances the breadth and potency of cross-neutralization. These findings reinforce the expectation that the upcoming XBB.1.5 mRNA vaccine would likely boost the neutralization of currently circulating variants, while also underscoring the critical importance of ongoing surveillance to monitor the evolution and immune evasion potential of SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

    "abstract": "Diatoms (Bacillariophyceae) are aquatic photosynthetic microalgae with an ecological role as primary producers in the aquatic food web. They account substantially for global carbon, nitrogen, and silicon cycling. Elucidating the chemical space of diatoms is crucial to understanding their physiology and ecology. To expand the known chemical space of a cosmopolitan marine diatom, Skeletonema marinoi, we performed High-Resolution Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS2) for untargeted metabolomics data acquisition. The spectral data from LC-MS2 was used as input for the Metabolome Annotation Workflow (MAW) to obtain putative annotations for all measured features. A suspect list of metabolites previously identified in the Skeletonema spp. was generated to verify the results. These known metabolites were then added to the putative candidate list from LC-MS2 data to represent an expanded catalogue of 1970 metabolites estimated to be produced by S. marinoi. The most prevalent chemical superclasses, based on the ChemONT ontology in this expanded dataset, were \"Organic acids and derivatives\", \"Organoheterocyclic compounds\", \"Lipids and lipid-like molecules\", and \"Organic oxygen compounds\". The metabolic profile from this study can aid the bioprospecting of marine microalgae for medicine, biofuel production, agriculture, and environmental conservation. The proposed analysis can be applicable for assessing the chemical space of other microalgae, which can also provide molecular insights into the interaction between marine organisms and their role in the functioning of ecosystems.\n\nImportanceDiatoms are abundant marine phytoplankton members and have great ecological importance and biochemical potential. The cosmopolitan diatom Skeletonema marinoi has become an ecological and environmental research model organism. In this study, we used untargeted metabolomics to acquire a general metabolic profile of S. marinoi to assess its chemical diversity and expand the known metabolites produced by this diatom. S. marinoi produces a chemically diverse set of secondary metabolites with potential therapeutic properties, such as anti-cancer, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory. Such metabolites are highly significant due to their potential role in drug discovery and bioeconomy. Lipids from S. marinoi also have potential in the biofuel industry. Furthermore, the environmental fluctuations in the water bodies directly affect the production of different secondary metabolites from diatoms, which can be key indicators of climate change.",

    "abstract": "Personalized interventions are deemed vital given the intricate characteristics, advancement, inherent genetic composition, and diversity of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The appropriate utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methodologies can yield novel understandings of CVDs, enabling improved personalized treatments through predictive analysis and deep phenotyping. In this study, we proposed and employed a novel approach combining traditional statistics and a nexus of cutting-edge AI/ML techniques to identify significant biomarkers for our predictive engine by analyzing the complete transcriptome of CVD patients. After robust gene expression data pre-processing, we utilized three statistical tests (Pearson correlation, Chi-square test, and ANOVA) to assess the differences in transcriptomic expression and clinical characteristics between healthy individuals and CVD patients. Next, the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) classifier assigned rankings to transcriptomic features based on their relation to the case-control variable. The top ten percent of commonly observed significant biomarkers were evaluated using four unique ML classifiers (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Xtreme Gradient Boosting Decision Trees, and k-Nearest Neighbors). After optimizing hyperparameters, the ensembled models, which were implemented using a soft voting classifier, accurately differentiated between patients and healthy individuals. We have uncovered 18 transcriptomic biomarkers that are highly significant in the CVD population that were used to predict disease with up to 96% accuracy. Additionally, we cross-validated our results with clinical records collected from patients in our cohort. The identified biomarkers served as potential indicators for early detection of CVDs. With its successful implementation, our newly developed predictive engine provides a valuable framework for identifying patients with CVDs based on their biomarker profiles.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to confirm evidence that the shrimp parvovirus IHHNV no longer has a significant negative economic impact on farmed shrimp production, and that it should be delisted as a pathogen by the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH). Current published evidence for delisting is presented in the introduction, and experimental evidence is presented from 11 commercial ponds cultivating the giant tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon in Thailand. All 11 ponds gave positive PCR test results for IHHNV using 2 methods recommended for IHHNV diagnosis by WOAH. However, when an additional in-house \"IHHNV Long-Amp method\" (IHHNV-LA) was also used to amplify 90% of the 4 kb IHHNV genome sequence, only 4 of the 11 ponds gave positive PCR test results. Further tests using normal histopathological analysis for the presence of pathognomonic Cowdry A type inclusions (CAI), in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) could confirm IHHNV infections in only 2 of those 4 ponds. In addition, a positive detection of CAI alone was equivalent to ISH or IHC in confirming IHHNV infection after a positive test with any of the PCR methods used. In summary, the recommended WOAH PCR methods gave false positive test results for IHHNV infection with 9/11 ponds (82%). All 11 ponds gave profitable harvests despite the confirmation of IHHNV in 2 ponds, where it was accompanied by various additional pathogens, as were all 11 ponds. Unfortunately, according to current practice, positive PCR test results with the WOAH methods can lead to rejection of traded shrimp products without assurance that they are not false positive results arising from EVE. Our results, results from others and our analysis of a recent decision of WOAH to maintain IHHNV as a listed disease suggest that WOAH must reconsider IHHNV for de-listing.",

The Delta and Omicron variants of concern are the most infectious strains, presenting mutated amino acid residues in their spike RBD. The Omicron variant quickly dominated the COVID-19 pandemic, indicating its greater spreadability. Omicrons spreading might be associated with mutational substitutions at spike RBD residues. We employed in silico molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the spike RBD-ACE2 interaction to compare the impact of specific mutations of the Delta and Omicron variants. The MD of the spike-ACE2 interaction showed the following: i) the amino acid profile involved in the spike-ACE2 interaction differs between Delta and Omicron; ii) the Omicron variant establishes several additional interactions, highlighting the spike RBD (S477), which is a flexible mutational residue. Since the S477N mutation is exclusive to Omicron, which may initiate binding with ACE2, the increased infectivity of Omicron might be associated not only with a mutated RBD but also with unmutated (e.g., G476 and L492) residues, initiating binding due to the influence of the N477 mutation. Compared to previous variants, Omicrons N477 residue represents a novelty within the spike-ACE2 interaction dynamics interface.",

We used DNA sequences from five genes for 135 species, with four fossil calibrations, to generate a time-calibrated phylogeny. We estimated diversification rates, ancestral areas (Nearctic or Neotropical), and ancestral habitat (coastal or upland), for each node. Our results suggest that Funduloidea originated in the Late Cretaceous and diversified from Late Paleocene to present at a uniform rate, except Cyprinodontidae expressed an accelerated rate of speciation ~11.02 Ma. Neither viviparity, marine-to-freshwater transition, consistently accelerated speciation. Funduloidea has a coastal origin, but invaded inland many times. Funduloidea phylogeny indicates, sea-level falls isolate coastal populations, but increase island accessibility and climatic cooling facilitates invasions of temperate species into the tropics. For continental lineages, ancient river drainages accord with lineage distributions, including enigmatic disjunctions in Goodeidae and Fundulus. Niche shifts occurred from estuaries to open coasts and from forests to grasslands. Antiquity, adaptability, and dynamic geography can explain Funduloidea diversity. Combined environmental and phylogenetic data unveil the history of the Gulf of Mexico watershed. Phylogeny suggests there was diversification by barrier displacement and coastal speciation pump. Overall, speciation time, transitions to freshwater, dispersal, vicariance, adaptive radiation, and viviparity contributed to total diversification.",

To overcome these limitations, we designed and validated a sensitive and specific PCR primer (scutico-634F) and nested two-step PCR protocol to detect this taxon, which excludes other ciliates associated with D. antillarum and has poor affinity for other related ciliates.

    "abstract": "The environmental challenges the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, faces during its progression into its various lifecycle stages warrant the use of effective and highly regulated access to chromatin for transcriptional regulation. Microrchidia (MORC) proteins have been implicated in DNA compaction and gene silencing across plant and animal kingdoms. Accumulating evidence has shed light into the role MORC protein plays as a transcriptional switch in apicomplexan parasites. In this study, using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool along with complementary molecular and genomics approaches, we demonstrate that PfMORC not only modulates chromatin structure and heterochromatin formation throughout the parasite erythrocytic cycle, but is also essential to the parasite survival. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments suggest that PfMORC binds to not only sub-telomeric regions and genes involved in antigenic variation but is also most likely a key modulator of stage transition. Protein knockdown experiments followed by chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) studies indicate that downregulation of PfMORC induces the collapse of the parasite heterochromatin structure leading to its death. All together these findings confirm that PfMORC plays a crucial role in chromatin structure and gene regulation, validating this factor as a strong candidate for novel antimalarial strategies.",

PfMORC (PF3D7_1468100) interacts with a suite of nuclear proteins, including APETALA2 (AP2) transcription factors (PfAP2-G5, PfAP2-O5, PfAP2-I, PF3D7_0420300, PF3D7_0613800, PF3D7_1107800, and PF3D7_1239200), a DNA helicase DS60 (PF3D7_1227100), and other chromatin remodelers (PfCHD1, PfEELM2, and PfISWI). Transcriptomic analysis of PfMORCHA-glmS knockdown parasites revealed 163 differentially expressed genes belonging to hypervariable multigene families, along with upregulation of genes mostly involved in host cell invasion. In vivo genome-wide chromatin occupancy analysis during both trophozoite and schizont stages of development demonstrates that PfMORC is recruited to repressed, multigene families, including the var genes in subtelomeric chromosomal regions. Collectively, we find that PfMORC is found in chromatin complexes that play a role in the epigenetic control of asexual blood stage transcriptional regulation.",

    "abstract": "Malaria transmission is strongly influenced by traits such as mosquito life expectancy, vector competence, and the Extrinsic Incubation Period (EIP, which is the development time of the parasite inside the mosquito). Even though these traits are known to be shaped by environmental temperature and there is considerable concern that climate change could increase disease risk in certain areas, surprisingly, these temperature dependencies are poorly characterized. Here, we use a mechanistic model fitted to novel experimental data to describe how Plasmodium falciparum infection of the African malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae, is modulated by temperature, including its influences on parasite establishment, conversion efficiency through parasite developmental stages, EIP and overall competence. We use these data, together with novel estimates of the survival of infected blood-fed mosquitoes, to explore the potential influence of temperature on transmission in four locations in Kenya, considering recent conditions and future climate change. Results provide insights into factors limiting transmission in cooler environments and indicate that increases in malaria transmission efficiency due to climate warming in areas like the Kenyan Highlands, might be less than previously predicted.",

    "abstract": "The skin barrier is vital for protection against environmental threats including insults caused by skin-resident microbes. Dysregulation of the barrier is a hallmark of atopic dermatitis (AD) and ichthyosis, with variable consequences for host immune control of colonizing commensals and opportunistic pathogens. While sensitisation to Malassezia, the most abundant commensal fungus of the skin, is common in AD, its relevance for pathogenesis remains unclear. Here we show that in barrier-disrupted skin, Malassezia acquires enhanced fitness. This is not a consequence of the dysregulated allergic immune status characteristic for AD but is rather explained by structural and metabolic changes in the cutaneous niche that provide increased accessibility and a favourable lipid profile, to which the lipid-dependent yeast adapts for enhanced nutrient assimilation. These findings reveal fundamental insights into the role of the mycobiota in the pathogenesis of common skin barrier disorders.",

Infection of outbred mice with 2009 H1N1 at embryonic day (E) 10 resulted in significant maternal morbidity, placental tissue damage and inflammation, fetal growth restriction, and developmental delays that lasted through weaning. Restriction of pulmonary virus replication was not inhibited during pregnancy, but infected dams had suppressed circulating and placental progesterone (P4) concentrations that were caused by H1N1-induced upregulation of pulmonary cyclooxygenase (COX)-1, but not COX-2-, dependent synthesis and secretion of prostaglandin (PG) F2. Treatment with 17--hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17-OHPC), a synthetic progestin that is safe to use in pregnancy, ameliorated the adverse maternal and fetal outcomes from H1N1 infection and prevented placental cell death and inflammation.

    "abstract": "Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an important human pathogen that has emerged through the horizontal acquisition of the staphylococcus cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec). Previously, we showed that SCCmec from heat-killed donors can be transferred via natural transformation in biofilms at frequencies of 10-8-10-7. Here, we show an improved transformation assay of SCCmec with frequencies up to 10-2 using co-cultured biofilms with living donor cells. The Ccr-attB system played an important role in SCCmec transfer, and the deletion of ccrAB recombinase genes reduced the frequency [~]30-fold. SCCmec could be transferred from either MRSA or methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci to some of methicillin-sensitive S. aureus recipients. In addition, the transformation of other plasmid or chromosomal genes is enhanced by using living donor cells. This study emphasizes the role of natural transformation as an evolutionary ability of S. aureus and in MRSA emergence.\n\nImportanceMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) stands out as the leading contributor to fatalities attributed to antibiotic-resistant infections. To comprehend its emergence and dissemination, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms behind it. MRSA has arisen through the horizontal acquisition of the methicillin resistance gene mecA, which is harboured within the staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCCmec). Our study sheds light on a noteworthy discovery: when methicillin-sensitive S. aureus recipient cells are grown alongside viable methicillin-resistant donor cells in co-cultured biofilms, a highly efficient transfer of SCCmec occurs, both within the same species and between different species. This remarkable transfer process is facilitated by natural transformation, underscoring its pivotal role in the evolution of staphylococci and the emergence of MRSA.",

    "abstract": "Influenza A virus (IAV) is one of the main causes of annual respiratory epidemics in humans. IAV employs multiple strategies to evade host immunity and hijack cellular mechanisms to support proper virion formation and propagation. Some of these strategies encompass the manipulation of pathways involved in protein homeostasis, leading to changes in the host proteome and protein distribution within the cell. In this study, we performed a detailed analysis of the interplay between IAV and the host cells proteostasis mechanisms throughout the entire infectious cycle. We reveal that IAV infection induces the activation of the inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) branch of the unfolded protein response (UPR), at an infection stage that coincides with high rates of viral protein translation. This activation is particularly important for infection, as attenuation of virus production was observed upon IRE1 inhibition. Concomitantly to UPR activation, we observed the accumulation of virus-induced insoluble protein aggregates, which contain both viral and host proteins and are associated with a dysregulation of the host cell RNA metabolism. We demonstrate that this accumulation is important for IAV propagation, as its prevention using a quinoline-steroid hybrid compound significantly reduces the number of produced infectious virus particles. Our data suggests that the formation of these insoluble protein aggregates favors the final steps of the infection cycle, more specifically the virion assembly. Our findings reveal additional mechanisms by which IAV disrupts the host cell proteostasis to favor infection and uncover new cellular targets that can be explored for the development of host-directed antiviral strategies.",

    "abstract": "The appressorium of phytopathogenic fungi is a specific structure with a crucial role in plant cuticle penetration. Pathogens with melanized appressoria break the cuticle through cell wall melanization and intracellular turgor pressure. However, in fungi with non-melanized appressorium, the mechanisms governing cuticle penetration are poorly understood. Here we characterize Row1, a previously uncharacterized appressoria-specific protein of Ustilago maydis that localizes to membrane and secretory vesicles. Deletion of row1 decrease appressoria formation and plant penetration, thereby reducing virulence. Specifically, the {Delta}row1 mutant has a thicker cell wall that is more resistant to glucanase degradation. We also observed that the {Delta}row1 mutant has secretion defects. Our data suggest that Row1 could modify the glucans that form the fungal cell wall and may be involved in unconventional protein secretion, thereby promoting both appressoria maturation and penetration. We show that Row1 is functionally conserved at least among Ustilaginaceae and belongs to the Row family, which consists of five other proteins that are highly conserved among Basidiomycota fungi and are involved in U. maydis virulence. We observed similarities in localization between Row1 and Row2, which is also involved in cell wall remodelling and secretion, suggesting similar molecular functions for members of this protein family.",

    "abstract": "Various diabetes complications, including nephropathy, retinopathy, and cardiovascular disease, arise from vascular dysfunction. In this context, it has been observed that past hyperglycaemic events can induce long-lasting transcriptional changes, a phenomenon termed \"metabolic memory\". Yet, the underlying mechanisms driving these persistent effects are not fully characterized. In this study, we evaluated the genome-wide gene expression and chromatin accessibility alterations caused by transient high glucose exposure in human endothelial cells (ECs). We found that cells exposed to a transient high glucose episode had decreased glycolytic and oxygen consumption rates. Transcriptional profiling indicated that high glucose exposure induced substantial changes in the expression of genes belonging to pathways known to be impaired in diabetes, such as TGF-beta, TNF, FoxO, p53, and NRF2 pathways, many of which were retained after normalization of glucose concentrations. Furthermore, analysis of chromatin accessibility showed that transient hyperglycaemia can induce persistent modifications in the accessibility landscape, with the majority of differentially accessible regions located in non-promoter regions. Some of these regions were identified as putative enhancers with neighbouring genes persistently altered after transient high glucose exposure. Finally, we showed that activation of the NRF2 pathway through either NRF2 overexpression or supplementation with the plant-derived compound sulforaphane, was able to substantially revert the glucose-induced transcriptional memory in ECs. Our findings demonstrate that transient high glucose can induce persistent changes in both the transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiles of ECs, and that pharmacological NRF2 pathway activation is able to prevent and revert the high-glucose-induced transcriptional memory.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=173 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/557207v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (47K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b9c938org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1498a43org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1146ab5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@169bfca_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Glycolysis is a central metabolic pathway in health and disease,1 an essential one in mature red blood cells (RBCs), which rely on the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway, i.e., glycolysis, as the sole source of energy generation.2 During aging in vivo and in vitro under blood bank conditions,3 the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generated via glycolysis in mitochondria-devoid mature RBCs is essential for the modulation of oxygen kinetics,4 deformability2 and, ultimately, intra- and extra-vascular hemolysis.3 Here we draw upon a cohort of 13,029 volunteers from the Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study (REDS) to identify biological and genetic traits associated with heterogeneity in glycolytic phenotypes. Age, sex and ethnicity influenced glycolysis, with additional effects due to genetic polymorphisms in regions coding for rate-limiting enzymes of glycolysis,1 phosphofructokinase 1 (PFKP) and hexokinase 1 (HK1), and for the ADP-ribosyl cyclase CD38. The gene-metabolite associations were validated by testing glycolysis in fresh and stored RBCs from 350 Diversity Outbred mice.5 These findings were further corroborated via multi-omics analyses of 1,929 samples at storage day 10, 23 and 42 in 643 RBC units from donors who were selected amongst the index cohort based on their extreme hemolytic propensity. Finally, we show that glycolysis, ATP levels, breakdown and deamination into hypoxanthine are associated with increased hemolytic propensity and vesiculation ex vivo, as well as with extravascular hemolysis in vivo, both in healthy autologous transfusion recipients from the Donor Iron Deficiency Study and in 4,700 heterologous critically ill patients receiving blood products from the REDS donors. This work advances our understanding of genetic and non-genetic factors that regulate glycolysis in mature RBCs, a simplified model of mammalian cell metabolism,6 a cell type where dysregulated glycolysis holds broader implications in hemolytic disorders, offering potential avenues for novel therapeutic interventions and transfusion strategies.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/557250v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (90K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@165776org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c81783org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7f9be8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d4d3fe_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "We propose a pipeline that combines AlphaFold2 (AF2) and crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) to model the structure of proteins with multiple conformations. The pipeline consists of two main steps: ensemble generation using AF2, and conformer selection using XL-MS data. For conformer selection, we developed two scores - the monolink probability score (MP) and the crosslink probability score (XLP), both of which are based on residue depth. We benchmarked MP and XLP on a large dataset of decoy protein structures, and showed that our scores outperform previously developed scores. We then tested our methodology on three proteins having an open and closed conformation in the Protein Data Bank: Complement component 3 (C3), luciferase, and glutamine-binding periplasmic protein (QBP), first generating ensembles using AF2, which were then screened for the open and closed conformations using experimental XL-MS data. In five out of six cases, the most accurate model within the AF2 ensembles - or a conformation within 1 [A] of this model - was identified using crosslinks, as assessed through the XLP score. In the remaining case, only the monolinks (assessed through the MP score) successfully identified the open conformation of QBP. This serves as a compelling proof-of-concept for the effectiveness of monolinks. In contrast, the AF2 assessment score (pTM) was only able to identify the most accurate conformation in two out of six cases. Our results highlight the complementarity of AF2 with experimental methods like XL-MS, with the MP and XLP scores providing reliable metrics to assess the quality of the predicted models.",

    "abstract": "DNA origami facilitates the synthesis of bespoke nanoscale structures suitable for a wide range of applications. Effective design requires prevention of uncontrolled aggregation, while still permitting directed assembly of multi-subunit superstructures. Uncontrolled aggregation can be caused by base-stacking interactions between arrays of blunt-ended helices on different structures, which are routinely passivated by incorporating disordered regions as either scaffold loops or poly-nucleotide brushes (usually poly-thymine) at the end of DNA helices. Such disordered regions are ubiquitous in DNA origami structures yet their exact design requirements in different chemical environments are ill defined. In this study, we systematically examine the use of scaffold loops and poly-nucleotide brushes for passivation and for controlling multi-subunit assembly. We assess the dependence of length and sequence for preventing aggregation amidst a titration of MgCl2 concentrations and the suitability of each strategy for enabling controlled multi-subunit assembly. We then introduce a novel strategy where double-stranded DNA helices run orthogonal to arrays of blunt-ended DNA helices forming a steric shield that prevents base stacking. The results define the limitations of each method and important design considerations for achieving monodispersity. For example, poly-thymine brushes are most effective for achieving monodispersity in the broadest conditions whereas scaffold loops can facilitate directed multi-subunit assembly. Finally, orthogonal DNA helices remove the need for disordered regions altogether, prevent aggregation in a broad range of MgCl2 concentrations and facilitate directed multi-subunit assembly. This study expands the design tools available and enables a more informed approach for achieving control of monodispersity and multi-subunit assembly in DNA origami structures.",

We demonstrate that the composability of our design scheme permits model-guided tuning of circuit function and the ability to make diverse network connections; synthetic phosphorylation circuits can be coupled to upstream cell surface receptors to enable fast-timescale sensing of extracellular ligands, while downstream connections can regulate gene expression.

    "abstract": "SNARE-mediated secretory vesicle (SV) exocytosis underpins neuronal communication. Munc18-1 orchestrates SNARE complex formation by controlling the opening of syntaxin-1A. How the SV-plasma membrane interface becomes fusion-competent at the nanoscale level is poorly understood. Here, we propose that the interaction of Munc18-1 with VAMP2 during vesicular docking triggers nanoscale re-organization which renders the SV-plasma membrane interface fusion-competent. We identified and mutated key residues in Munc18-1 domain 3a (A297 and T304) hypothesised to impair its interaction with VAMP2. Munc18-1A297H, and to a lesser extent Munc18-1T304H, constrained SVs on the plasma membrane and reduced stimulated secretion, under re-expression conditions in Munc18-1/2 double knockout neurosecretory cells. Moreover, the de-clustering of Munc18-1 in response to activity was lost for both mutants. The interaction of VAMP2 with the Munc18-1 domain 3a therefore controls the re-organization of the nanoscale environment of the docked SV-plasma membrane interface, fostering syntaxin-1A opening and Munc18-1 release to ensure that SNARE assembly only occurs within the confinement of docked vesicles.",

    "abstract": "EROS (essential for reactive oxygen species) is a recently identified molecular chaperone of NOX2 (gp91phox), the catalytic subunit of phagocyte NADPH oxidase. Deficiency in NOX2 expression or function due to genetic mutations leads to chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) with recurrent bacterial and fungal infections. To delineate how EROS interacts with NOX2, we solved the cryo-EM structure of the EROS-NOX2-p22phox heterotrimeric complex. EROS binds to NOX2 in plasma membrane through its anti-parallel -helices H1 and H2, and in cytoplasm through multiple {beta}-strands that form hydrogen bonds with the C terminal fragment of NOX2. EROS binding alters the conformation of the TM2 and TM6 transmembrane helices, increases the distance between the two hemes, and causes dislocation of the binding site for flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). EROS colocalizes with NOX2 on cell surface of neutrophil-like HL-60 cells and forms a heterotrimer with mature NOX2-p22phox in transfected cells. Phorbol myristate acetate, an activator of NOX2, induces dissociation of EROS from NOX2 in a NanoLuc complementation assay with concurrent production of superoxide in reconstituted cells. Taken together, these findings provide a structural basis for EROS-NOX2 interaction and suggest a previously unidentified function of EROS in regulating NOX2 activation.",

    "abstract": "The human gut microbiota is a complex community comprised of hundreds of species, with a few present in high abundance and the vast majority in low abundance. The biological functions and effects of these low-abundant species on the host are not yet fully understood. In this study, we assembled a bacterial consortium (SC-4) consisting of B. paravirosa, C. comes, M. indica, and A. butyriciproducens, which are low-abundant, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) producing bacteria isolated from healthy human gut and tested its effect on host health using germfree and human microbiota associated mice models of colitis. Our findings demonstrate that SC-4 can colonize in Germ-free (GF) mice, increasing mucin thickness by activating the MUC-1 and MUC-2 genes, thereby protecting GF mice from Dextran Sodium Sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. Moreover, SC-4 aided in the recovery of human microbiota-associated mice from DSS-induced colitis, and intriguingly, its administration enhanced the alpha diversity of the gut microbiome, shifting the community composition closer to control levels. We also show a functional redundancy existing in the gut microbiome, resulting in the low abundant SCFA producers acting as a form of insurance, which in turn accelerates recovery from dysbiotic state upon the administration of SC-4. SC-4 colonization also upregulated iNOS gene expression, further supporting its ability to enhance mucin thickness upon colonization. A metagenomic analysis of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) patient samples revealed a decrease in the abundance of SC-4 bacteria in both Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohns Disease (CD), highlighting the potential importance of these species in the human gut. Collectively, our results provide evidence that low-abundant SCFA-producing species in the gut may offer a novel therapeutic approach for IBD.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is a human pathogen responsible for a spectrum of diseases such as pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis. The capsule is the major pneumococcal virulence factor and is encoded by the capsular polysaccharide (cps) locus, a recombination hot spot that has resulted in over 100 distinct capsular polysaccharide types (serotypes) identified to date. Recently, 33X (also known as 10X) was proposed as a putative novel serotype, but the capsule structure had not been elucidated. Here, we provide an in-depth investigation of 33X, demonstrating it is a new pneumococcal capsular serotype. In this study, we screened 12,850 nasopharyngeal swabs from both healthy children and pneumonia patients (adults and children) in Mongolia collected between 2015-2022. We identified 20 pneumococcal 33X isolates. Using whole genome sequencing, we found that the 33X cps locus is a chimera of genes from pneumococcal serogroups 35, 10 and 33, as well as other Streptococcal species. Serotyping of 33X pneumococci by the Quellung reaction revealed a unique serological profile, typing as both 10B and 33B. Competitive ELISAs confirmed that antibodies that were generated in mice directed against 33X were inhibited by 33X pneumococci but not 10B or 33B. Lastly, elucidation of the 33X capsule structure revealed that the polysaccharide is distinct from other serotypes, consisting of an O-acetylated hexasaccharide repeat unit of [-&gt;]5)-{beta}-Galf-(1[-&gt;]3)-{beta}-Glcp-(1[-&gt;]5)-{beta}-Galf 2Ac-(1[-&gt;]3)-{beta}-GalpNAc-(1[-&gt;]3)--Galp-(1[-&gt;]4)-Rib-ol-(5[-&gt;]P[-&gt;]. Therefore, 33X meets the requisite genetic, serological, and biochemical criteria to be designated as a new serotype, which we have named 33G.\n\nIMPORTANCEStreptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is a bacterial pathogen with the greatest burden of disease in Asia and Africa. The pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide has biological relevance as a major virulence factor, as well as public health importance as it is the target for currently licensed vaccines. These vaccines have limited valency, covering up to 23 of the >100 known capsular types (serotypes) with higher valency vaccines in development. Here, we have characterized a new pneumococcal serotype, which we have named 33G. We detected serotype 33G in nasopharyngeal swabs (n=20) from children and adults hospitalized with pneumonia, as well as healthy children in Mongolia. We show that the genetic, serological, and biochemical properties of 33G differs from existing serotypes, satisfying the criteria to be designated as a new serotype. Future studies should focus on the geographical distribution of 33G and any changes in prevalence following vaccine introduction.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is a major contributor to bacterial antibiotic resistance. ARGs are strongly selected in environments containing corresponding antibiotics, but it is less clear how ARGs are maintained in environments where antibiotic selection might be weak or sporadic. In particular, few studies have directly estimated the effect of ARGs on host fitness in the absence of direct selection. To the extent that ARGs impose costs, it is not clear if these are fixed or might depend on the host strain, perhaps marking some ARG-host combinations as low-cost reservoirs that can act to maintain ARGs in the absence of antibiotic selection. We quantified the fitness effects of six ARGs in each of 12 diverse Escherichia spp. strains in two environments. Only one ARG (blaTEM-116, encoding resistance to some {beta}-lactam antibiotics) imposed an overall cost. However, all but one ARG imposed a cost in at least one host strain, reflecting a significant ARG cost-by-strain interaction effect. A simulation model predicts that these interactions cause the ecological success of ARGs to depend on available host strains, and, to a lesser extent, for successful host strains to depend on the ARGs present in a community. Together, these results indicate the need to consider the potential of reservoir strains for maintenance of ARGs.",

In this study, we examined the abundance and composition of the fungi and bacteria inhabiting Vaccinium spp. nectar, as well as nectar volume and sugar concentrations, hypothesizing that nectar traits and microbial communities would vary between plants. We compared wild V. myrsinites with two field-grown V. corymbosum cultivars collected from two organic and two conventional farms. Differences in nectar traits and microbiomes were identified between V. corymbosum cultivars but not Vaccinium species. The microbiome of cultivated plants also varied greatly between farms, whereas management regime had only subtle effects, with higher fungal populations detected under organic management. Nectars were hexose-dominant, and sugars were depleted in nectar with higher cell densities. Bacteria were more common than fungi in blueberry nectar, although both were frequently detected and co-occurred more often than would be predicted by chance.  Cosmopolitan blueberry nectar microbes that were isolated in all plants, including Rosenbergiella sp. and Symmetrospora symmetrica, were identified.

    "abstract": "BackgroundWorld Health Organization Grade 2 meningiomas (G2Ms) exhibit an aggressive natural history characterized by recurrence and therapy resistance. G2Ms with histopathological necrosis have been associated with worse local control (LC) following radiation therapy, but drivers and biomarkers of radiation resistance in these G2Ms remain unknown.\n\nMethodsWe performed genetic sequencing and histopathological analysis of 113 G2Ms and investigated the role of intratumoral hypoxia as well as genes of interest through knockdown and clonogenic survival following ionizing radiation. Lastly, we performed transcriptional profiling of our in vitro model and 18 G2M tumors using RNA sequencing.\n\nResultsNF2 loss-of-function (LOF) mutations were associated with necrosis in G2Ms (p=0.0127). Tumors with NF2 mutation and necrosis had worse post-radiation LC compared to NF2 wildtype tumors without necrosis (p=0.035). Under hypoxic conditions, NF2 knockdown increased radiation resistance in vitro (p<0.001). Bulk RNA sequencing of our in vitro model revealed NF2- and hypoxia-specific changes and a 50-gene set signature specific to radiation resistant, NF2 knockdown and hypoxic cells, which could distinguish NF2 mutant and necrotic patient G2Ms by unsupervised clustering. Gene set enrichment analysis of patient tumor and in vitro data revealed downregulation of apoptosis and upregulation of proliferation in NF2-deficient and hypoxic cells, which we validated with functional assays.\n\nConclusionsNF2 LOF in the setting of hypoxia confers radiation resistance through transcriptional programs that reduce apoptosis and promote proliferation. These pathways may identify tumors resistant to radiation and represent therapeutic targets that in the future could improve LC in patients with radiation resistant G2Ms.\n\nKEY POINTS1. Spontaneous necrosis with NF2 mutations is associated with radio-resistance in WHO G2Ms.\n\n2. NF2 knockdown in the setting of hypoxia confers radio-resistance to meningioma cells in vitro and is driven by increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis.\n\nIMPORTANCE OF THE STUDYWorld Health Organization Grade 2 meningiomas (G2M) are often treated with surgical resection followed by radiation, especially in the case of recurrence. However, the mechanisms underlying radiation resistance in G2Ms remain to be identified, and moreover, we lack biomarkers to distinguish G2Ms that will respond to radiotherapy from those that are refractory. In this study we perform histological and molecular analysis of a large cohort of G2Ms to identify predictors of radiation resistance. Using these data and an in vitro model of radiation therapy, we demonstrate that radiation resistance in G2Ms is likely driven by the combination of NF2 gene mutations and the hypoxia that accompanies tumor necrosis. Patients whose tumors bear these two features may therefore benefit from alternative treatments that target specific pathways implicated in radiation resistance.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDMitochondrial transplantation has recently gained prominence as a novel technique primarily focused on addressing ischemiareperfusion injuries and rare mitochondrial mutation diseases. Platelets, abundant in the bloodstream, play a crucial role in immune function. Upon activation, platelets release mitochondria encapsulated within extracellular vesicles, here referred to as \"mitlets\". These mitlets exhibit a preference for being internalized by immune cells circulating in the bloodstream, enhancing their cellular energetics. Herein, we hypothesized that the transplantation of mitlets between young animals and aged animals may exert a significant influence on the progression of infectious diseases.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN AND METHODSIn this study, murine models of Influenza H1N1 infection and sepsis were employed to investigate disease dynamics. Specifically, mitlets isolated from young and healthy mice were transplanted into cohorts of mice of the same age afflicted by H1N1 infection, or into aged mice subjected to polymicrobial infection and sepsis. Survival outcomes and the quantification of cytokine levels were assessed across experimental groups to elucidate the potential therapeutic effects of mitlet transplantation.\n\nRESULTSIn the matched-age H1N1 infection model, as predicted, mitlet transplantation did not yield a statistically significant improvement in survival, although it did show a trend towards a reduction in the circulating inflammatory cytokine burden. In the young-to-old sepsis model, the transplantation of mitlets was associated with a significant enhancement in survival rates and a substantial reduction in bacterial loads and circulating cytokine levels.\n\nDISCUSSIONOur findings suggest that mitochondrial transplantation may constitute a safe and promising avenue for enhancing the immune systems capacity to counter infectious threats. This pilot investigation sets the stage for further exploration. It is plausible that in the future, immune senescence resulting from diminished mitochondrial energy production could be ameliorated through such transplantation interventions. As a consequence, this approach holds substantial potential as a novel immunotherapeutic strategy for the management of infectious diseases.",

    "abstract": "Stress Granules (SG) formation is a cellular protection mechanism in harmful conditions, constituting a storage for untranslated mRNAs and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs); however, these condensates can turn into pathological aggregates, that in neurons are related to the onset of neurodegenerative diseases, like Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Mutations in the RBP FUS leading to its cytoplasmic mis-localization are causatively linked to ALS, since they mediate its accumulation in SGs, triggering their transition towards cytotoxic inclusions. Here, we describe the SG transcriptome in a neural context and compare with datasets from other systems, identifying both common rules and diversifying characteristics for SG recruitment of transcripts. We demonstrate that SG dynamics and RNA content are strongly modified by the incorporation of aberrantly localized mutant FUS, switching to a more unstructured, AU-rich SG transcriptome and losing a wide population of GC-rich, structured RNAs. We show that these alterations mainly depend on mutant FUS which favors the SG incorporation of its protein interactors and in turn of their target RNAs. Our data give a comprehensive view of the molecular differences between physiological and pathological SG in ALS conditions, showing how a single mutation is sufficient to impact the RNA and protein population of these condensates.",

    "abstract": "The yellow-flowered Spathoglottis aurea (tribe Collabieae; family Orchidaceae) is native to the mountainous areas of Peninsular Malaysia. The species is well known as an ornamental plant and for its role in artificial hybrid breeding. There is an interesting evolutionary relationship between S. aurea and the geographically isolated S. microchilina from Borneo that has encouraged further study of the S. aurea populations, but the genomic resource for S. aurea has not yet been reported. The present study reports the first work to characterize a chloroplast genome among the Spathoglottis genus. The complete chloroplast (cp) genome of S. aurea was assembled from a sequence generated by the Illumina platform and analysed in comparison with other Collabieae species available in the GenBank database. The cp genome of S. aurea is 157,957 base pairs (bp) in length with guanine-cytosine (GC) content of 37.3%. The genome possessed a typical quadripartite chloroplast genome structure with large single-copy (LSC) (86,888 bp), small single-copy (SSC) (18,125 bp) and inverted repeat (IR) (26,472 bp) sequences. A total of 134 genes were annotated, with 88 protein coding genes (PCGs), 38 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes and eight ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. Overall, 80 simple sequence repeats (SSR) or microsatellites were identified. Comparative analysis with other Collabieae species revealed high conservation in the cp genome arrangements with minimal difference in genome lengths. However, several mutational hotspots were also detected, with high potential to be developed as genetic markers for phylogenetic analysis. Characterization of the S. aurea cp genome revealed its conserved nature without gene loss or rearrangements when compared to other species of the Collabieae tribe. Phylogenetic analysis of Collabieae species also revealed that S. aurea has a distant evolutionary relationship to other members of the Collabieae species, despite the presence of problematic genera such as Phaius and Cephalantheropsis.",

    "abstract": "The symbiosis between giant sea anemones, photosynthetic algae of the family Symbiodiniaceae, and anemonefish is an iconic example of a mutualistic \"menage a 3\"1. Patterns of associations among 28 species of anemonefish and 10 species of giant sea anemone hosts are complex: Some anemonefish species are highly specialized to inhabit only one species of sea anemone (e.g., Amphiprion frenatus with Entacmaea quadricolor), whereas others are more generalist and can live in almost any host species (e.g., Amphiprion clarkii)1,2,3. Reasons for host preferences and the mechanisms involved are obscured, among other things, by the lack of resolution of giant sea anemone phylogeny. Recent molecular analyses have shown that giant sea anemones hosting anemonefish belong to three distinct clades: Entacmaea, Stichodactyla, and Heteractis4,5,6. Inside these clades, however, species delimitation has been impeded by morphological variability of the giant sea anemones and is poorly resolved with classical markers4,5. Here, we employed an extensive transcriptomic dataset from 55 sea anemones collected from southern Japan to build a robust phylogeny. With this dataset, we observed that the bubble-tip sea anemone E. quadricolor, currently considered to be a single species, can in fact be separated into at least four distinct cryptic lineages (A-D). Moreover, these lineages can be precisely distinguished by their association with anemonefish: A. frenatus is only found associated with lineage D, whereas A. clarkii lives in the other three lineages.",

    "abstract": "A crucial step in functional genomics is identifying actively translated open reading frames (ORFs) that link biological functions. The challenge lies in identifying short ORFs, as they are greatly impacted by data quality and depth. Here, we improved the coverage of super-resolution Ribo-seq in Arabidopsis, revealing uncharacterized translation events in nucleus-, chloroplast-, and mitochondria-encoded genes. We identified 7,751 unconventional translation events, including 6,996 upstream ORFs (uORFs) and 209 downstream ORFs on annotated protein-coding genes, as well as 546 ncORFs on presumed non-coding RNAs. Proteomics data confirmed the production of stable proteins from some of the unannotated translation events. We present evidence of active translation on primary transcripts of tasiRNAs (TAS1-4) and microRNAs (pri-miR163, pri-miR169), and periodic ribosome stalling supporting co-translational decay. Additionally, we developed a method for identifying extremely short uORFs, including 370 minimum uORF (AUG-stop), and 2,984 tiny uORFs (2-10 aa), as well as 681 uORFs that overlap with each other. Remarkably, these short uORFs exhibit strong translational repression as longer uORFs. We also systematically discovered 594 uORFs regulated by alternative splicing, suggesting widespread isoform-specific translational control. Finally, these prevalent uORFs are associated with numerous important pathways. In summary, our improved Arabidopsis translational landscape provides valuable resources to study gene expression regulation.",
