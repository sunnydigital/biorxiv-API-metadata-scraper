    "abstract": "It was suggested over 60 years ago that echolocation is widespread in animals. Although echolocation has been found to evolve independently in several mammalian lineages, this hypothesis remains largely untested due to the difficulty of determining the presence of echolocation. To address this issue, we combined molecular convergence analyses from 190 high-quality mammalian genomes with machine learning to predict potential new mammalian echolocators. Our model predicted three promising lineages of echolocating mammals. Behavioral experiments confirmed that the gracile shrew mole (Uropsilus gracilis), the highest- ranking species among predicted echolocators, as well as almost all shrew moles (Uropsilinae), are capable of echolocation through the use of ultrasonic pulses. In contrast to most bats that use laryngeal echolocation, the characteristics of calls, the morphology of the stylohyal bone, and the results of tongue ligation experiments all suggest that shrew moles produce ultrasonic clicks with their tongues for echolocation. Finally, we estimated at least 20% of all living mammalian orders with echolocation ability, thus empirically supporting Griffins hypothesis that echolocation is widespread among animals. Our findings not only provide evidence that three novel lineages of echolocating mammals, but also demonstrate that phylogenetically replicated phenotypes can be predicted through genetic convergence.\n\nOne sentence summaryShrew moles are capable of echolocation.",

    "abstract": "In poor nitrogen conditions, fission yeast cells mate, undergo meiosis and form spores that are resistant to deleterious environments. Natural isolates of Schizosaccharomyces pombe are homothallic. This allows them to naturally switch between the two h- and h+ mating types with a high frequency, thereby ensuring the presence of both mating partners in a population of cells. However, alteration of the mating type locus can abolish mating type switching or reduce it to a very low frequency. Such heterothallic strains have been isolated and are common in research laboratories due to the simplicity of their use for Mendelian genetics. In addition to the standard laboratory strains, a large collection of natural S. pombe isolates is now available, representing a powerful resource for investigating the genetic diversity and biology of fission yeast. However, most of these strains are homothallic, and only tedious or mutagenic strategies have been described to obtain heterothallic cells from a homothallic parent. Here, we describe a simple approach to generate heterothallic strains. It takes advantage of an alteration of the mating type locus that was previously identified in a mating type switching-deficient strain and the CRISPR-Cas9 editing tool, allowing for a one-step engineering of heterothallic cells with high efficiency.\n\nTake away points- Conventional methods for obtaining heterothallic fission yeast strains are inefficient\n- We implemented a streamlined genetic editing approach to engineer heterothallism\n- All fission yeast isolates reported in Jeffares et al. 2015 can be engineered\n- This method enhances the exploration of genetic diversity in wild fission yeast",

    "abstract": "SO_SCPLOWUMMARYC_SCPLOWOne of the goals of precision psychiatry is to characterize mental disorders in an individualized manner, taking into account the underlying dynamic processes. Recent advances in mobile technologies have enabled the collection of Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMAs) that capture multiple responses in real-time at high frequency. However, EMA data is often multi-dimensional, correlated, and hierarchical. Mixed-effects models are commonly used but may require restrictive assumptions about the fixed and random effects and the correlation structure. The Recurrent Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RTRBM) is a generative neural network that can be used to model temporal data, but most existing RTRBM approaches do not account for the potential heterogeneity of group dynamics within a population based on available covariates. In this paper, we propose a new temporal generative model, the Heterogeneous-Dynamics Restricted Boltzmann Machine (HDRBM), to learn the heterogeneous group dynamics and demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on simulated and real-world EMA data sets. We show that by incorporating covariates, HDRBM can improve accuracy and interpretability, explore the underlying drivers of the group dynamics of participants, and serve as a generative model for EMA studies.",

    "abstract": "Using deep learning in cancer research to tackle scientific challenges is becoming an increasingly popular technique. Advances in enhanced data generation, machine learning algorithms, and compute infrastructure have led to an acceleration in the use of deep learning in various domains of cancer research such as drug response problems. In our study, we explored tree-based models to improve the accuracy of a single drug response model and demonstrate that tree-based models such as XGBoost have advantages over deep learning models, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN), for single drug response problems. However, comparing models is not a trivial task. To make training and comparing CNNs and XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) more accessible to users, we developed an open-source library called UNNT (A novel Utility for comparing Neural Net and Tree-based models). The case studies, in this manuscript, focus on cancer drug response datasets however the application can be used on datasets from other domains, such as chemistry.\n\nAuthor summaryAdvancement in data science, machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI) methods has enabled extraction of meaningful information from large and complex datasets that has assisted in better understanding, diagnosing, and treating cancer. The understanding of the drug response domain in cancer research has been accelerated with developing ML models to aid in predicting the effectiveness of the drugs based on a specific genomic molecular feature. In this study we developed a novel robust framework called UNNT (A novel Utility for comparing Neural Net and Tree-based models) that trains and compares deep learning method such as CNN and tree-based method such as XGBoost on the user input dataset. We applied this software to single drug response problem in cancer to identify the best performing ML method based on the National Cancer Institute 60 (NCI60) dataset. In addition, we studied the computational aspects of training each of these models where our results show that neither is evidently superior on both CPUs and GPUs while training. This shows that when both models have similar error rates for a dataset the hardware available determines the model choice for training as discussed in tables 7 and 11.

    "abstract": "Bats fly using significantly different wing motions than other fliers, stemming from the complex interplay of their membrane wings motion and structural properties. Biological studies show that many bats fly at Strouhal numbers, the ratio of flapping to flight speed, 50-150% above the range typically associated with optimal locomotion. We use high-resolution fluid-structure interaction simulations of a bat wing to independently study the role of kinematics and material/structural properties on aerodynamic performance and show that peak propulsive and lift efficiencies for a bat-like wing motion require flapping 66% faster than for a bird-like motion, agreeing with the increased flapping frequency observed in zoological studies. In addition, we find that reduced membrane stiffness is associated with improved propulsive efficiency until the membrane flutters, but that incorporating microstructural anisotropy arising from biological fiber reinforcement enables a tenfold reduction of the flutter energy whilst maintaining high aerodynamic efficiency. Our results indicate that animals with specialized flapping motions may have correspondingly specialized flapping speeds, in contrast to arguments for a universally efficient Strouhal range. Additionally, our study demonstrates the significant role that the microstructural constitutive properties of the membrane wing of a bat can have on its propulsive performance.",

    "abstract": "Representation learning (RL) is a universal technique for deriving low-dimensional disentangled representations from high-dimensional observations, aiding a multitude of downstream tasks. RL has been extensively applied to various data types, including images and natural language. Here, we analyze molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data of biomolecules in terms of RL to obtain disentangled representations related to their conformational transitions. Currently, state-of-the-art RL techniques, which are mainly motivated by the variational principle, try to capture slow motions in the representation (latent) space. Here, we propose two methods based on alternative perspective on the disentanglement in the representation space. The methods introduce a simple prior that imposes temporal constraints in the representation space, serving as a regularization term to facilitate capturing disentangled representations of dynamics. The introduction of this simple prior aids in characterizing the conformational transitions of proteins. Indeed, comparison with other methods via the analysis of MD simulation trajectories for alanine dipeptide and chignolin validates that the proposed methods construct Markov state models (MSMs) whose implied time scales are comparable to state-of-the-art methods. By coarse-graining MSMs, we further show the methods aid to detect physically important interactions for conformational transitions. Overall, our methods provide good representations of complex biomolecular dynamics for downstream tasks, allowing for better interpretations of conformational transitions.",

    "abstract": "The genetic and intratumoral heterogeneity observed in human osteosarcomas (OS) poses challenges for drug development and the study of cell fate, plasticity, and differentiation, processes linked to tumor grade, cell metastasis, and survival. To pinpoint errors in OS differentiation, we transcriptionally profiled 31,527 cells from a tissue-engineered model that directs MSCs toward adipogenic and osteoblastic fates. Incorporating pre-existing chondrocyte data, we applied trajectory analysis and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to generate the first human mesenchymal differentiation atlas. This  roadmap served as a reference to delineate the cellular composition of morphologically complex OS tumors and quantify each cells lineage commitment. Projecting these signatures onto a bulk RNA-seq OS dataset unveiled a correlation between a stem-like transcriptomic phenotype and poorer survival outcomes. Our study takes the critical first step in accurately quantifying OS differentiation and lineage, a prerequisite to better understanding global differentiation bottlenecks that might someday be targeted therapeutically.\n\nStatement of SignificanceOS treatment kills proliferating cells without addressing the root cause: dysregulated differentiation. By deconvolving OS tumors by cell type and differentiation archetype, we identified core gene sets linked to cell fate and patient survival. The ability to quantify, and eventually modulate, such archetypes facilitate a novel OS-specific drug-screening strategy.",

Engineered Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) lines that accumulate 15% to 30% oil of leaf dry weight resulted in starkly different metabolic phenotypes. In-depth analysis of the leaf lipid accumulation and 14CO2 metabolic tracing mechanistically described metabolic adaptations to the leaf oil engineering. An oil-for-membrane lipid tradeoff in the 15% oil line (referred to as HO) was surprisingly not further exacerbated when lipid production was enhanced to 30% (LEC2 line). The HO line exhibited a futile cycle that limited TAG yield through exchange with starch, altered carbon flux into various metabolite pools and end products, and suggested overlapping pathways of the glyoxylate cycle and photorespiration that limited CO2 assimilation by 50%. In contrast, inclusion of the LEC2 transcription factor in tobacco improved TAG stability, alleviated the TAG-to-starch futile cycle, and recovered CO2 assimilation and plant growth comparable to wild type but with much higher lipid levels in the leaves. Thus, the unstable production of storage reserves and futile cycling limit vegetative oil engineering approaches. The capacity to overcome futile cycles and maintain enhanced stable TAG levels in LEC2 demonstrated the importance of considering unanticipated metabolic adaptations while engineering vegetative oil crops.",

Here we show that knockdown of GABA release from central amygdala neurotensin neurons using a vGAT-shRNA-based AAV strategy reduces alcohol drinking in male, but not female, mice. This manipulation did not impact avoidance behavioral assays, except in a fasted novelty-suppressed feeding test, in which vGAT shRNA mice of both sexes demonstrated increased latency to feed on a familiar high-value food reward.

Second, by constraining the boundaries to be the same across hemispheres, we provide a symmetric version of the atlas, which is especially useful in studying functional lateralization. Finally, the atlas allows for precision mapping in individuals: The integration of the probabilistic group atlas with an individual localizer scan results in a marked improvement in prediction of individual boundaries.

    "abstract": "Chronic pain represents a major unmet clinical need. Neuropathic pain, that is pain arising due to damage or disease of the somatosensory nervous system, represents a sizeable proportion of chronic pain cases, affecting around 8% of the general population. Neuronal hyperexcitability is a key driver of neuropathic pain. Leucine glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1), is a secreted protein known to regulate excitability within the nervous system and is the target of autoantibodies from neuropathic pain patients. Therapies that block or reduce antibody levels are highly effective at relieving pain in these patients, suggesting that LGI1 has an important role in clinical pain. Here we have studied the role of LGI1 in regulating pain using mouse models to specifically ablate LGI1 in neuron populations. LGI1 has been well studied at the level of the brain. Here we show that LGI1 is highly expressed in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and in dorsal horn neurons of the spinal cord. Using transgenic mice, we ablated LGI1, either specifically in nociceptors (LGI1fl/Nav1.8(+/-)), or in all DRG and spinal neurons (LGI1fl/Hoxb8(+/-)). On acute pain assays, mild phenotypes were observed when compared to littermate controls with limited changes in DRG neuron excitability. No differences were seen in the first phase of the formalin test, however LGI1fl/Hoxb8(+/-) mice displayed a significant increase in nocifensive behaviours in the second phase compared to littermate controls. Using the spared nerve injury model, we assessed the impact of LGI1 ablation on neuropathic pain-like behaviours. LGI1fl/Nav1.8(+/-) mice showed no differences in nerve injury induced mechanical hypersensitivity, brush-evoked allodynia or spontaneous pain behaviour compared to controls. However, LGI1fl/Hoxb8(+/-) mice showed a significant exacerbation of mechanical hypersensitivity and allodynia. These data show that LGI1 has a role in regulating pain sensitivity particularly in the context of nerve injury. We suggest this effect is likely mediated at the spinal level since no differences were observed following specific ablation of LGI1 in nociceptors. Neurons in dorsal horn of the spinal cord are important in gating nerve injury induced mechanical pain and our findings suggest that LGI1 plays an important role in this process.",

    "abstract": "The perivascular space (PVS) plays a crucial role in facilitating the clearance of waste products and the exchange of cerebrospinal fluid and interstitial fluid in the central nervous system. While optical imaging methods identify the glymphatic transport of fluorescent tracers through PVS of surface-diving arteries, their limited depth penetration impedes the study of glymphatic dynamics in deep brain regions. In this study, we introduced a novel high-resolution dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI mapping approach based on single-vessel multi-gradient-echo methods. This technique allowed the differentiation of penetrating arterioles and venules from adjacent parenchymal tissue voxels and enabled the detection of Gd-enhanced signals coupled to PVS of penetrating arterioles in the deep cortex and hippocampus. By directly infusing Gd into the lateral ventricle, we eliminated delays in cerebrospinal fluid flow and focused on PVS Gd transport through PVS of hippocampal arterioles. The study revealed significant PVS-specific Gd signal enhancements, shedding light on glymphatic function in deep brain regions. These findings advance our understanding of brain-wide glymphatic dynamics and hold potential implications for neurological conditions characterized by impaired waste clearance, warranting further exploration of their clinical relevance and therapeutic applications.",

    "abstract": "Lesions of the primary visual cortex (V1) cause retrograde neuronal degeneration, volume loss and neurochemical changes in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Here we characterise the timing of these processes, by comparing the LGN of adult marmoset monkeys following various recovery times after unilateral V1 lesions. Observations in NeuN-stained sections obtained from animals with very short (3 days) recoveries showed that the volume and neuronal density in the LGN ipsilateral to the lesions were similar to those in the contralateral hemispheres. However, neuronal density in the LGN lesion projection zones (LPZ) dropped rapidly thereafter, with a loss of [~]50% of the population occurring within a month of the lesions. This level of neuronal loss was then sustained for the remainder of the range of recovery times, up to >3 years post-lesion. In comparison, shrinkage of the LGN progressed more gradually, not reaching a stable value until 6 months post lesion. We also determined the time course of the expression of the calcium-binding protein calbindin (CB) in magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P) layer neurons, a recently described form of neurochemical plasticity triggered by V1 lesions. We found that CB expression could be detected in surviving M and P neurons as early as 1 month after a lesion, with the percentage of neurons showing this neurochemical phenotype showing subtle changes over 6 months. Our study shows that there is a limited time window for any possible interventions aimed at reducing secondary neuronal loss in the visual afferent pathways following damage to V1.",

    "abstract": "Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is a lysosomal storage disorder typically resulting from biallelic loss-of-function variants in the ARSA gene which encodes the lysosomal enzyme, arylsulphatase A, leading to the accumulation of its substrate, sulphatide, and widespread demyelination. Although gene therapy is available for MLD, it is limited by high cost and a narrow window for intervention, which means the development of therapies for MLD remains a key goal. The aim of the present study was to explore disease mechanisms in MLD with a view to identifying novel targets for therapeutic intervention for patients who cannot avail of gene therapy. Postmortem globus pallidus and dentate nucleus tissue was obtained from MLD cases (N=5; age 2-33 years old) and compared to age-, sexand ethnicitymatched controls (N=5) and studied using discovery proteomics which demonstrated a marked inflammatory response, activation of the mTOR pathway, oxidative stress and metabolic remodelling in MLD cases. Histological analysis of inflammatory markers, including the terminal fragment of complement pathway activation, C3d, and the secreted glycoprotein YKL-40, a commonly used biomarker for inflammation, demonstrated their enrichment in MLD cases. Given that the mTOR pathway plays a key role in supressing autophagy, we next investigated autophagy and identified the accumulation of autophagosomes in MLD cases, consistent with deficient autophagy. Taken together, these findings suggest inflammation and autophagy dysfunction are key processes involved in MLD and that the mTOR pathway could be a novel therapeutic target for MLD.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRecent evidence suggests that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) indirectly influences brain activity through cranial nerve pathways, particularly the trigeminal nerve. However, the electrophysiological effects of direct current (DC) stimulation on the trigeminal nerve (DC-TNS) and its impact on trigeminal nuclei remain unknown. These nuclei exert control over brainstem centers regulating neurotransmitter release, such as serotonin and norepinephrine, potentially affecting global brain activity.\n\nObjectivesTo investigate how DC-TNS impacts neuronal activity in the principal sensory nucleus (NVsnpr) and the mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal nerve (MeV).\n\nMethodsTwenty male Sprague Dawley rats (n=10 each nucleus) were anesthetized with urethane. DC stimulation, ranging from 0.5 to 3 mA, targeted the trigeminal nerves marginal branch. Simultaneously, single-unit electrophysiological recordings were obtained using a 32-channel silicon probe, comprising three one-minute intervals: pre-stimulation, DC stimulation, and post-stimulation. Xylocaine was administered to block the trigeminal nerve as a control.\n\nResultsDC-TNS significantly increased neuronal spiking activity in both NVsnpr and MeV, returning to baseline during the post-stimulation phase. When the trigeminal nerve was blocked with xylocaine, the robust 3 mA trigeminal nerve DC stimulation failed to induce increased spiking activity in the trigeminal nuclei.\n\nConclusionOur results offer initial empirical support for trigeminal nuclei activity modulation via DC-TNS. This discovery supports the hypothesis that cranial nerve pathways may play a pivotal role in mediating tDCS effects, setting the stage for further exploration into the complex interplay between peripheral nerves and neural modulation techniques.\n\nHighlightsO_LIDirect current stimulation of the trigeminal nerve (DC-TNS) modulates neural activity in rat NVsnpr and MeV.\nC_LIO_LIXylocaine administration reversibly blocks the DC-TNS effect on neural responses.\nC_LIO_LITrigeminal nerve stimulation should be considered a possible mechanism of action of tDCS.\nC_LI",

These mood disorders are associated with changes in many aspects of brain reward pathways, yet cellular and molecular changes in the brain are not readily available in clinical populations. Therefore, the use of biomarkers as proxies for changes in the brain are necessary. The proliferation of mitochondria in blood has emerged as a potentially useful biomarker, yet a clear consensus on how these mood disorders impact mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn) has not been reached.\n\nMethodsFollowing PRISMA guidelines for a systematic search, 22 papers met inclusion criteria for meta-analysis (10 MDD, 10 BD, 2 both MDD and BD). We extracted demographic, disorder, and methodological information with mtDNAcn. Using the metafor package for R, calculated effect sizes were used in random effects or meta regression models for MDD and BD.\n\nResultsOur results show a trending increase in mtDNAcn in patients with MDD, which reaches significance when one study with outlying demographic characteristics is excluded. Overall, there was no effect of BD on mtDNAcn, however, further subgroup and meta-regression analysis indicated the effects on mtDNAcn are dependent on BD type.\n\nConclusionsTogether our data suggest whole blood/leukocyte mtDNAcn may be a useful biomarker for mood disorders, with MDD and BD Type II associated with higher mtDNAcn, and BD Type I associated with lower mtDNAcn. Further study of blood mtDNAcn could predict downstream health outcomes or treatment responsivity in individuals with mood disorders.",

    "abstract": "RationalePreclinical studies report attenuated ethanol-induced conditioned taste aversion (CTA) following chronic ethanol exposure, suggesting that tolerance develops to the aversive properties of ethanol. However, these studies are confounded by pre-exposure to the unconditioned stimulus (US; ethanol), which is well known to hinder conditioning.\n\nObjectivesThis study was designed to determine whether chronic ethanol exposure produces tolerance to the aversive properties of ethanol in the absence of a US pre-exposure confound.\n\nMethodsCTA was performed in adult male and female Long-Evans rats by pairing 0.1% ingested saccharin with an intraperitoneal injection of ethanol (1.5 or 2.0 g/kg) or saline. Rats were then rendered ethanol dependent using chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor exposure. Controls were exposed to room air (AIR). The effect of chronic ethanol on CTA expression and reconditioning were examined following vapor exposure.\n\nResultsPrior to vapor exposure, both sexes developed CTA to a comparable degree with 2.0 g/kg producing greater CTA than 1.5 g/kg ethanol. Following vapor exposure, AIR controls exhibited an increase in CTA magnitude compared to pre-vapor levels. This effect was absent in CIE-exposed rats. These group differences were eliminated upon re-conditioning after vapor exposure.\n\nConclusionsThese data suggest that chronic ethanol does not facilitate tolerance to the aversive properties of ethanol but rather, attenuates incubation of ethanol-induced CTA. Loss of CTA incubation suggests that CIE exposure disrupts circuits encoding aversion.",

    "abstract": "Insulin plays a critical role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Since metabolic demands change momentarily, insulin release needs to be constantly adjusted. These adjustments are mediated via distinct pathways, most prominently the blood glucose level, but also feedforward signals from motor circuits, and different neuromodulatory pathways. Here, we analyzed how neuromodulatory inputs control the activity of the main source of insulin in Drosophila - a population of Insulin-Producing Cells (IPCs) located in the brain. IPCs are functionally analogous to mammalian pancreatic beta cells, but their location makes them accessible for in-vivo recordings in intact animals. We characterized the functional inputs to IPCs using single-nucleus RNA sequencing analysis, anatomical receptor expression mapping, and an optogenetics-based \"intrinsic pharmacology\" approach. Our results show that the IPC population expresses a variety of receptors for neuromodulators and classical neurotransmitters. Interestingly, individual IPCs exhibit heterogeneous receptor profiles, suggesting they could be modulated differentially. This is supported by electrophysiological recordings of IPCs which we performed while activating different populations of modulatory neurons. Our analysis revealed that some modulatory inputs had heterogeneous effects on the IPC activity, such that they inhibited one subset of IPCs, while exciting another. Monitoring calcium activity across the IPC population revealed that these heterogeneous responses occured simultaneously. Certain neuromodulatory populations shifted the IPC population activity towards an excited state, while others shifted the IPCs towards inhibition. Taken together, we provide a comprehensive, multi-level framework of neuromodulation in the insulinergic system of Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "Animal and human studies have shown that the seizure-generating region is vastly dependent on distant neuronal hubs that can decrease duration and propagation of ongoing seizures. However, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of the impact of distant brain areas on specific interictal or ictal epileptic activities (e.g., isolated spikes, spike trains, seizures). Such knowledge is critically needed since all kinds of epileptic activities are not equivalent in terms of clinical expression and impact on the progression of the disease. We used surface, high-density EEG and multisite intracortical recordings, combined with pharmacological silencing of specific brain regions in the well-known kainate mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. We tested the impact of selective regional silencing on the generation of epileptic activities within a continuum ranging from very transient to more sustained and long-lasting discharges reminiscent of seizures. Silencing the contralateral hippocampus completely suppresses sustained ictal activities in the focus, as efficiently as silencing the focus itself, but while focus silencing abolishes all focal activities, contralateral silencing fails to control transient spikes. In parallel, we observed that sustained epileptic discharges in the focus are preceded by contralateral firing and more strongly phase locked to bi-hippocampal delta/theta oscillations than transient spiking activities, reinforcing the presumed dominant role of the contralateral hippocampus in promoting long-lasting, but not transient, epileptic activities. Altogether, our work provides suggestive evidence that the contralateral hippocampus is necessary for the interictal-to ictal-state transition and proposes that cross-talk between contralateral neuronal activity and ipsilateral delta/theta oscillation could be a candidate mechanism underlying the progression from short to long-lasting epileptic activities.\n\nKey PointsO_LIWe study how regions remote from the focus influence epileptic activities in the kainate mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy.\nC_LIO_LIThe contralateral hippocampus plays a decisive role in the initiation of sustained epileptic activities\nC_LIO_LIIntegration of contralateral activities and bi-hippocampal delta/theta oscillations precedes focal paroxysmal activities\nC_LIO_LIWe propose that a large-scale epileptic network might be necessary for the transition from interictal to ictal states\nC_LI",

However, due to differences between studies in ear stimulation sites and extent of effect on autonomic variables, it is challenging to determine what part of the external ear is the optimum site for electrode placement. This study investigated the autonomic effects of bilateral tANS at four different sites on the external auricle of the ear: tragus, cymba concha, helix and earlobe. tANS was performed using modified surface electrodes connected to a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) machine. Participants (n = 24) each underwent four sessions where a 15 minute period of stimulation (pulse width: 200 s; pulse frequency: 30 Hz; current: adjusted to sensory threshold) was applied bilaterally to either the tragus, cymba concha, helix or earlobe. Heart rate and blood pressure were continuously recorded during 10-minute baseline, 15-minute stimulation and 10-minute recovery periods. Heart rate variability (HRV) was derived. Results showed that regardless of site, stimulation significantly influenced measures of HRV. Baseline LF/HF ratio predicted change in LF/HF ratio during stimulation for each site and for all sites combined. Response (i.e. change in LF/HF ratio between baseline and stimulation) was closely linked with measures reflecting starting autonomic function. This demonstrates the importance of evaluating how autonomic function is modulated by tANS in individual participants (as well as the whole group). These findings have key implications for adopting a tailored approach when considering the therapeutic/clinical applications of tANS.",

We then leveraged this dataset to develop a lightweight memory B cell language model (mBLM) for sequence-based antibody specificity prediction. Model explainability analysis showed that mBLM captured key sequence motifs of HA stem antibodies. Additionally, by applying mBLM to HA antibodies with unknown epitopes, we discovered and experimentally validated many HA stem antibodies.

Our Cusp Resilience Assessment (CUSPRA) has three characteristics: i) it provides estimates on how likely a system is to cross a tipping point characterized by hysteresis, ii) it assesses resilience in relation to multiple external drivers, and iii) it produces straightforward results for ecosystem-based management. We validated our approach using simulated data and demonstrated its application using empirical time-series of an Atlantic cod population and of marine ecosystems in the North and the Mediterranean Sea. We show that CUSPRA provides a powerful method to empirically estimate resilience in support of a sustainable management of our constantly adapting ecosystems under global climate change.",

We hypothesized i) that syntopies are more common among phylogenetically deeply divergent cryptic species than among close relatives, and ii) that sympatries are an outcome of phylogenetic relatedness and dispersal, with range size as a proxy of dispersal ability.\n\nLocationWestern Europe.\n\nTaxonSubterranean amphipod crustaceans of the polyphyletic Niphargus rhenorhodanensis species complex.\n\nMethodsUnilocus species delimitations (PTP, ASAP), calibrated multilocus phylogenetic analyses, co-occurrence analyses using a probabilistic model, generalized linear models (GLM).\n\nResultsThe studied species complex comprises 37-48 molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) from nine different clades. Syntopies are random or less frequent than expected, implying an insufficient between-MOTU differentiation allowing stable coexistence. GLM suggested that age of divergence does not predict species sympatries, although they emerge more frequently among MOTUs from different clades. By contrast, sympatries emerge when at least one MOTU disperses over a large geographic range. Biodiversity rich regions were found at the foothills of the Alps, the Jura and the Central Massif, regardless the inference method.\n\nMain conclusionsBiodiversity patterns of the herein studied species complex are driven mainly by dispersal and reflect geographic circumstances of speciation. While species richness on a local scale may be the outcome of competition and dispersal, regional biodiversity patterns emerged through biogeographic history on a clade-level.",

    "abstract": "Microbial symbioses have had profound impacts on the evolution of animals. Conversely, changes in host biology may impact the evolutionary trajectory of symbionts themselves. Blattabacterium cuenoti is present in almost all cockroach species and enables hosts to subsist on a nutrient-poor diet. To investigate if host biology has impacted Blattabacterium at the genomic level, we sequenced and analysed 25 genomes from Australian soil-burrowing cockroaches (Blaberidae: Panesthiinae) which have undergone at least seven independent subterranean transitions from above-ground, wood-feeding ancestors. We find at least three independent instances of genome erosion have occurred in Blattabacterium strains exclusive to Australian soil-burrowing cockroaches. Such shrinkages have involved the repeated inactivation of genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis and nitrogen recycling, the core role of Blattabacterium in the host-symbiont relationship. The most drastic of these erosions have occurred in hosts thought to have transitioned underground the earliest relative to other lineages. As Blattabacterium is unable to fulfil its core function in such host groups, our findings suggest soil-burrowing cockroaches must acquire these nutrients from novel sources. Our study represents one of the first cases, to our knowledge, of parallel host adaptations leading to concomitant parallelism in their mutualistic symbionts, further underscoring the intimate relationship between these two partners.",

    "abstract": "Cells detect changes of external environments or communicate with each other through proteins on their surfaces. These cell surface proteins form a complicated network of interactions in order to fulfill their functions. The interactions between cell surface proteins are highly dynamic and thus challenging to detect using traditional experimental techniques. Here we tackle this challenge by a computational framework. The primary focus of the framework is to develop new tools to identify interactions between domains in immunoglobulin (Ig) fold, which is the most abundant domain family in cell surface proteins. These interactions could be formed between ligands and receptors from different cells, or between proteins on the same cell surface. In practice, we collected all structural data of Ig domain interactions and transformed them into an interface fragment pair library. A high dimensional profile can be then constructed from the library for a given pair of query protein sequences. Multiple machine learning models were used to read this profile, so that the probability of interaction between the query proteins can be predicted. We tested our models to an experimentally derived dataset which contains 564 cell surface proteins in human. The cross-validation results show that we can achieve higher than 70% accuracy in identifying the PPIs within this dataset. We then applied this method to a group of 46 cell surface proteins in C elegans. We screened every possible interaction between these proteins. Many interactions recognized by our machine learning classifiers have been experimentally confirmed in the literatures. In conclusion, our computational platform serves a useful tool to help identifying potential new interactions between cell surface proteins in addition to current state-of-the-art experimental techniques. The tool is freely accessible for use by the scientific community. Moreover, the general framework of the machine learning classification can also be extended to study interactions of proteins in other domain superfamilies.",

    "abstract": "Time-series single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data have opened a door to elucidate cell differentiation processes. In this context, the optimal transport (OT) theory has attracted attention to interpolate scRNA-seq data and infer the trajectories of cell differentiation. However, there remain critical issues in interpretability and computational cost. This paper presents scEGOT, a novel comprehensive trajectory inference framework for single-cell data based on entropic Gaussian mixture optimal transport (EGOT). By constructing a theory of EGOT via an explicit construction of the entropic transport plan and its connection to a continuous OT with its error estimates, EGOT is realized as a generative model with high interpretability and low computational cost, dramatically facilitating the inference of cell trajectories and dynamics from time-series data. The scEGOT framework provides comprehensive outputs from multiple perspectives, including cell state graphs, velocity fields of cell differentiation, time interpolations of single-cell data, space-time continuous videos of cell differentiation with gene expressions, gene regulatory networks, and reconstructions of Waddingtons epigenetic landscape. To demonstrate that scEGOT is a powerful and versatile tool for single-cell biology, we applied it to time-series scRNA-seq data of the human primordial germ cell-like cell (human PGCLC) induction system. Using scEGOT, we precisely identified the PGCLC progenitor population and the bifurcation time of the segregation. Our analysis suggests that a known marker gene TFAP2A alone is not sufficient to identify the PGCLC progenitor cell population, but that NKX1-2 is also required. In addition, we found that MESP1 and GATA6 may also be crucial for PGCLC/somatic cell segregation.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is one of the most common psychiatric disorders, and the consumption of this substance is considered one of the main causes of preventable deaths worldwide. Lipids play a crucial functional role in cell membranes, however little is known about the role of lipids containing extracellular vesicles (EVs), as regulatory molecules and biomarkers. In this study, a highly sensitive lipidomic strategy is employed to characterize plasma EV lipid species from individuals with AUD, to evaluate differential functional roles and enzymatic activity networks to improve the knowledge of lipid metabolism in the alcohol consumption. Plasma EV lipids from female and male patients with AUD and healthy individuals were analyzed to obtain lipid differential abundance, as well as biological interpretation of LINEX2 lipidomics data, evaluating enzymatic dysregulation through an enrichment algorithm. Our results showed for the first time that females with AUD exhibit greater substrate-product changes in LPC and PC lipids, as well as phospholipases and acyltransferases activity, potentially linked to cancer progression and neuroinflammation. Conversely, males with AUD showed dysregulation in Cer and SM lipid, involving sphingomyelinases, sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase, and sphingomyelin synthase, which could be related with hepatotoxicity. Notably, females with AUD showed LION-terms associated with \"positive intrinsic curvature\", while males exhibited \"negative intrinsic curvature, contributing to vesicle fusion processes. These methodological developments allow a better understanding of lipid metabolism and its regulatory mechanisms, which contributes not only to identify novel lipid targets, but also the discovery of sex-specific clinical biomarkers in the AUD.",

Studies in vitro and in anesthetized animals suggest nonlinearities emerge in cells input-output (activation) functions as network activity increases, yet how neurons transform inputs in vivo has been unclear. Here, we characterize cortical principal neurons activation functions in awake mice using two-photon optogenetics and imaging. We find responses to fixed optogenetic input are nearly unchanged as neurons are excited, reflecting a linear response regime above neurons resting point. In contrast, responses are dramatically attenuated by suppression. This attenuation is a powerful means to filter inputs arriving to suppressed cells, privileging other inputs arriving to excited neurons. These data have two major implications: first, neural activation functions in vivo accord with the activation functions used in recent machine learning systems, and second, neurons IO functions can enhance sensory processing by attenuating some inputs while leaving others unchanged.",

    "abstract": "During behavior, the motor cortex sends copies of motor-related signals to sensory cortices. It remains unclear whether these corollary discharge signals strictly encode movement or whether they also encode sensory experience and expectation. Here, we combine closed-loop behavior with large-scale physiology, projection-pattern specific recordings, and circuit perturbations to show that neurons in mouse secondary motor cortex (M2) encode sensation and are influenced by expectation. When a movement unexpectedly produces a sound, M2 becomes dominated by sound-evoked activity. Sound responses in M2 are inherited partially from the auditory cortex and are routed back to the auditory cortex, providing a path for the dynamic exchange of sensory-motor information during behavior. When the acoustic consequences of a movement become predictable, M2 responses to self-generated sounds are selectively gated off. These changes in single-cell responses are reflected in population dynamics, which are influenced by both sensation and expectation. Together, these findings reveal the rich embedding of sensory and expectation signals in motor cortical activity.",

    "abstract": "Acquiring sequential information is of utmost importance, e.g., for language acquisition in children. Yet, the long-term storage of statistical learning in children is poorly understood. To address this question, 27 seven-year-olds and 28 young adults completed four sessions of visual sequence learning (Year 1). From this sample, 16 seven-year-olds and 20 young adults participated in another four equivalent sessions after a 12-month-delay (Year 2). The first three sessions of each year used stimulus set-1, while the last session used stimulus set-2 to investigate transfer effects. Each session consisted of alternating learning and test phases in a modified artificial grammar learning task. In Year 1, seven-year-olds and adults learned the regularities and showed transfer to stimulus set-2. Both groups retained their final performance level over the one-year-period. In Year 2, children and adults continued to improve with stimulus set-1, but did not show additional transfer gains. Adults overall outperformed children, but transfer effects were indistinguishable between both groups. The present results suggest that long-term memory traces are formed from repeated sequence learning which can be used to generalize sequence rules to new visual input. However, the present study did not provide evidence for a childhood advantage in learning and remembering sequence rules.",

This study was undertaken to examine the ability of APRIL to regulate B cell-mediated inflammatory response in a model of antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) in mice.

In the acute stage of disease APRIL-Tg mice displayed a decrease in joint swelling, disease score and inflammatory infiltrate in articular tissues, as compared with their littermates. In addition, we observed a decrease of cellularity in draining lymph nodes of APRIL-Tg mice.

    "abstract": "Adoptive T-cell therapy has become a powerful weapon for cancer treatment. The efficacy of antitumor immunity is associated with the metabolic state of cytotoxic T cells, which is highly sensitive to the tumor microenvironment. It is therefore of considerable interest to bypass immunosuppressive signals in the tumor microenvironment and to identify factors that augment cytotoxic effector functions and ultimately tumor killing. Whether ionic signals serve as aberrant immune signals and influence the adaptive human antitumor immune response is still largely unexplored. We therefore investigated the effect of sodium on the phenotype, function and metabolic regulation of human CD8+ T cells using transcriptomic, metabolomic, high-dimensional flow cytometric and functional assays. We demonstrate a significant enrichment of sodium in solid tumors from patients with breast cancer, which leaves a transcriptomic imprint on intratumoral immune cells. Sodium chloride (NaCl) enhanced the activation state and effector functions of human CD8+ memory T cells. These functional alterations were associated with enhanced metabolic fitness, particularly increases in glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation and overall nutrient uptake. These NaCl-induced effects translated into increased tumor cell killing in vitro and in a tumor mouse model in vivo. We therefore propose NaCl as a positive regulator of acute antitumor immunity that could be harnessed for ex vivo conditioning of adoptively transferred T cells, such as CAR T-cells.",

    "abstract": "Blood vessel pruning during angiogenesis is the optimization process of the branching pattern to improve the transport properties of a vascular network. Recent studies show that part of endothelial cells (ECs) subjected to lower shear stress migrate toward vessels with higher shear stress in opposition to the blood flow for vessel regression. While dynamic changes of blood flow and local mechano-stress could coordinately modulate EC migration for vessel regression within the closed circulatory system, the effect of complexity of haemodynamic forces and vessel properties on vessel pruning remains elusive. Here, we reconstructed a 3-dimentsional (3D) vessel structure from 2D confocal images of the growing vessels in the mouse retina, and numerically obtained the local information of blood flow, shear stress and blood pressure in the vasculature. Moreover, we developed a predictive model for vessel pruning based on machine learning. We found that the combination of shear stress and blood pressure with vessel radius was tightly corelated to vessel pruning sites. Our results highlighted that orchestrated contribution of local haemodynamic parameters was important for the vessel pruning.\n\nAuthors SummaryBlood vessel networks formed by angiogenic vessel growth subsequently undergo extensive vascular remodeling process by regression of selected vascular branches. Optimization of the branching pattern in the vasculature is critical to ensure sufficient blood supply throughout the entire tissue. Recent studies have highlighted a strong relationship between the vessel remodeling and the shear stress acting on the vessel wall. However, its detailed mechanisms remain elusive due to the difficulties of estimating local haemodynamic parameters and relating them to vessel remodeling.\n\nHere, we have numerically simulated local haemodynamic parameters within the vascular network of the postnatal day 6 (P6) mouse retinal vasculature. Then, the relationship among the local shear stress, blood pressure, and vessel radius with the vessel pruning was examined. Moreover, we developed a predictive model for the vessel pruning based on the local haemodynamic parameters by a machine learning technique. Importantly, our results indicate that the combination of shear stress and blood pressure with vessel radius is tightly correlated to vessel pruning sites.\n\nGiven the ongoing clinical approach to suppress tumor growth via blood vessel normalization, our results provide important knowledge for developing future medicine such as nanomedicine based on drug delivery systems.",

However, there is currently a lack of efficient computational tools tailored for scRNA-seq data analysis, which can simultaneously analyze the entire sequence across different time points as well as accounting for temporal batch effects.\n\nIn this paper, we present a non-parametric statistical method called TDEseq that takes full advantage of smoothing splines basis functions to account for the dependence of multiple time points, and uses hierarchical structure linear additive mixed models to model the correlated cells within an individual. As a result, TDEseq demonstrates powerful performance in identifying four potential temporal expression patterns within a specific cell type, including growth, recession, peak, and trough. Extensive simulation studies and the analysis of four published scRNA-seq datasets show that TDEseq can produce well-calibrated p-values and up to 20% power gain over the existing methods for detecting temporal gene expression patterns, even with the case in large heterogeneous.\n\nTDEseq is also capable of handling unwanted confounding factors that may be hidden in biological processes, thereby enabling advancements in investigations that utilize time-resolved or time-course scRNA-seq data, particularly in the multi-sample multi-stage studies.",

Starting from a chemical library, ST171, a bitopic chemotype activating 5-HT1AR was evolved. In vitro pharmacological investigations of ST171 revealed potent and selective Gi activation (EC50 = 0.3 nM), with marginal Gs and {beta}-arrestin recruitment. Preclinical studies in mice showed that ST171 was effective in acute and chronic (inflammatory and neuropathic) pain models, without causing sedation. Comparison of cryo-EM structures of a 5-HT1AR-Gi complex bound to the functionally biased agonist ST171, with a structure bound to the functionally balanced agonist befiradol, showed that both ligands bind to the same orthosteric site, but address different exo-sites. The individual poses are associated with ligand-specific helical dispositions and rearrangements of microdomains. Complementation of these studies with molecular dynamics simulations allowed us to derive structural features associated with ST171s functional selectivity, a phenomenon that may be crucial to the discovery of more effective and safe GPCR drugs.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the GBA1 gene have been identified as a prevalent genetic risk factor for Parkinsons disease (PD). GBA1 mutations impair enzymatic activity, leading to lysosomal dysfunction and elevated levels of -synuclein (-syn). While most research has primarily focused on GBA1s role in promoting synucleinopathy, emerging evidence suggests that neuroinflammation may be a key pathogenic alteration caused by GBA1 deficiency. To examine the molecular mechanism underlying GBA1 deficiency-mediated neuroinflammation, we generated Gba1 E326K knock-in (KI) mice using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology, which is linked to an increased risk of PD and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). In the ventral midbrain and hippocampus of 24-month-old Gba1 E326K KI mice, we found a moderate decline in GBA1 enzymatic activity, a buildup of glucosylceramide, and an increase in microglia density. Furthermore, we observed increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and formation of reactive astrocytes in primary microglia and astrocytes, respectively, cultured from Gba1 E326K KI mice following treatment with pathologic -syn preformed fibrils (PFF). Additionally, the gut inoculation of -syn PFF in Gba1 E326K KI mice significantly enhanced the accumulation of Lewy bodies in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, accompanied by aggravated neuroinflammation and exacerbated non-motor symptoms. This research significantly enhances our understanding of the Gba1 E326K mutations involvement in neuroinflammation and the cell-to-cell transmission of pathogenic -syn in the brain, thereby opening new therapeutic avenues.",

    "abstract": "The host immune system plays a significant role in managing and clearing pathogen material during an infection, but this complex process presents numerous challenges from a modeling perspective. There are many mathematical and statistical models for these kinds of processes that take into account a wide range of events that happen within the host. In this work, we present a Bayesian joint model of longitudinal and time-to-event data of Leishmania infection that considers the interplay between key drivers of the disease process: pathogen load, antibody level, and disease. The longitudinal model also considers approximate inflammatory and regulatory immune factors. In addition to measuring antibody levels produced by the immune system, we adapt data from CD4+ and CD8+ T cell proliferation, and expression of interleukin 10, interferon-gamma, and programmed cell death 1 as inflammatory or regulatory factors mediating the disease process. The model is developed using data collected from a cohort of dogs naturally exposed to Leishmania infantum. The cohort was chosen to start with healthy infected animals, and this is the majority of the data. The model also characterizes the relationship features of the longitudinal outcomes and time of death due to progressive Leishmania infection. In addition to describing the mechanisms causing disease progression and impacting the risk of death, we also present the models ability to predict individual trajectories of Canine Leishmaniosis (CanL) progression. The within-host model structure we present here provides a way forward to address vital research questions regarding the understanding progression of complex chronic diseases such as Visceral Leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease causing significant morbidity worldwide.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe immune system is complex and its effectiveness against infection depends on a variety of host and pathogen factors. Despite numerous studies of Leishmania parasite infections, researchers are still discovering new connections between immune system components with hopes of better understanding how the immune system functions during Leishmania infection.\n\nThe development of tools for understanding, preventing, and predicting Leishmania infection outcomes is the main goal of this work. We present a computational model made using field-collected data during canine Leishmania infections. The model considers the interplay between three main components: parasite load, antibody level, and disease severity. The model explores how key inflammatory and regulatory elements of the immune response affect these main components, including T cell proliferation and important cytokine expressions such as protective interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}) or inhibitory interleukin 10 (IL-10) [1]. Although the induction of CD4+ T helper 1 cell responses is considered essential for immunity against Leishmania, B cells and the production of Leishmania-specific antibodies have also been proposed to play an important role in disease progression [2]. In a simpler model, Pabon-Rodriguez et. al. [3] showed antibody levels are dependent on pathogen load and canine Leishmaniasis (CanL) disease presentation. These high levels of Leishmania specific antibodies are observed in subjects with visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) and other severe forms of Leishmanial disease, and there is accumulating evidence that B cells and antibodies correlate with pathology [4]. In Section 1, we introduce Canine Leishmaniasis and discuss the importance of host-pathogen interaction with the immune response. Next, in Section 2, we introduce the data collection study, the variables utilized in this model, and define the clinical signs of Leishmania infection. In addition, this section explains how the presented model was constructed based on different techniques. A summary of model parameters, model implementation details, convergence diagnostics, and sensitivity analysis are also included. In Section 3, we provide summary results of how different model variables interact with one another and disease progression forecasts. In Section 4, we discuss the results and provide further recommendations and considerations.",

    "abstract": "The long-term health effects of SARS-CoV-2, termed Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), are quickly evolving into a major public health concern, but the underlying cellular and molecular etiology remain poorly defined. There is growing evidence that PASC is linked to abnormal immune responses and/or poor organ recovery post-infection. However, the exact processes linking non-resolving inflammation, impaired tissue repair, and PASC are still unclear. In this report, we utilized a cohort of respiratory PASC patients with viral infection-mediated pulmonary fibrosis and a clinically relevant mouse model of post-viral lung sequelae to investigate the pathophysiology of respiratory PASC. Using a combination of imaging and spatial transcriptomics, we identified dysregulated proximal interactions between immune cells and epithelial progenitors unique to respiratory PASC but not acute COVID-19 or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Specifically, we found a central role for lung-resident CD8+ T cell-macrophage interactions in maintaining Krt8hi transitional and ectopic Krt5+ basal cell progenitors, and the development of fibrotic sequelae after acute viral pneumonia. Mechanistically, CD8+ T cell derived IFN-{gamma} and TNF stimulated lung macrophages to chronically release IL-1{beta}, resulting in the abnormal accumulation of dysplastic epithelial progenitors in fibrotic areas. Notably, therapeutic neutralization of IFN-{gamma} and TNF, or IL-1{beta} after the resolution of acute infection resulted in markedly improved alveolar regeneration and restoration of pulmonary function. Together, our findings implicate a dysregulated immune-epithelial progenitor niche in driving respiratory PASC and identify potential therapeutic targets to dampen chronic pulmonary sequelae post respiratory viral infections including SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Coral microhabitats are colonized by a myriad of microorganisms, including diverse bacteria which are essential for host functioning and survival. However, the location, transmission, and functions of individual bacterial species living inside the coral tissues remain poorly studied. Here, we show that a previously undescribed bacterial symbiont of the coral Pocillopora acuta forms cell-associated microbial aggregates (CAMAs) within the mesenterial filaments. CAMAs were found in both adults and larval offspring, providing evidence of vertical transmission. In situ laser capture microdissection of CAMAs followed by 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding and shotgun metagenomics produced a near complete metagenome-assembled genome. We subsequently cultured the CAMA bacteria from P. acuta colonies, and sequenced and assembled their genomes. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the CAMA bacteria belong to an undescribed Endozoicomonadaceae genus and species, which we propose to name Sororendozoicomonas aggregata gen. nov sp. nov. Metabolic pathway reconstruction from its genome sequence suggests this species can synthesize most amino acids, several B vitamins, and antioxidants, which may be beneficial to its coral hosts. This study provides detailed insights into a new member of the widespread Endozoicomonadaceae family, thereby improving our understanding of coral holobiont functioning. Vertically transmitted, tissue-associated bacteria, such as S. aggregata may be key candidates for the development of microbiome manipulation approaches with long-term positive effects on the coral host.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria of the genus Legionella are natural pathogens of the environment that can cause legionellosis, which can result in severe human pneumonia called Legionnaires disease. Here we describe a novel Legionella species isolated from hot tap water. High quality complete genome was generated using a combination of Nanopore and Illumina sequencing approaches. Our novel Legionella isolate possesses a 4,071,709 bp chromosome and a single novel large incF conjugative plasmid of 160,437 bp. Interestingly, the chromosome encodes for 14 secondary metabolites biosynthetic gene clusters, more than any known other Legionella sp. The novel plasmid encodes for multiple genes that confer resistance to heavy metals. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the genome of the new isolate differs from any previously described Legionella species. The closest related species to our isolate is Legionella cherrii. The name proposed for the new specie is Legionella felix in honor of Dr. Arthur Felix (1887-1956), a pioneering microbiologist, and member of the Royal Society of UK, who established the National Public Health Laboratory in Tel Aviv.",

    "abstract": "Studies into the viral fraction of complex microbial communities like in the mammalian gut have recently garnered much interest. Yet there is still no standardized protocol for extracting viruses from such samples, and the protocols that exist employ procedures that skew the viral community of the sample one way or another. The first step of the extraction pipeline often consists of basic filtering of macromolecules and bacteria, yet even this affects the viruses in a strain-specific manner. In this study we investigate a protocol for viral extraction based on ultrafiltration and6 how the choice of ultrafilter might influence the viral community. Clinical samples (feces, vaginal7 swabs, and tracheal suction samples) were spiked with a mock community of known phages (T4,8 c2, {Phi}6, {Phi}29, {Phi}x174, and {Phi}2972), filtered, and quantified by spot and plaque assays to estimate the9 loss in recovery. Especially the enveloped {Phi}6 phage is severely affected by choice of filter, but also10 tailed phages such as T4 and c2 have a reduced infectivity after ultrafiltration. We conclude that11 the pore size of ultrafilters may affect the recovery of phages in a strain- and sample dependent12 manner, suggesting the need for greater thought when selecting filters for virus extraction.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial-fungal interactions are pervasive in the rhizosphere. While an increasing number of endohyphal bacteria (EHB) have been identified, little is known about their ecology and impact on the associated fungal hosts and the surrounding environment. In this study, we characterized the genome of an Enterobacter sp. (En-Cren) isolated from the generalist fungal pathogen Rhizoctonia solani. Overall, the En-Cren genome size was typical for members of the genus and was capable of free-living growth. The genome was 4.6 MB in size, and no plasmids were detected. Several prophage regions and genomic islands were identified that harbor unique genes in comparison with phylogenetically closely related Enterobacter spp. Type VI secretion system and cyanate assimilation genes were identified from the bacterium, while common heavy metal resistance genes were absent. En-Cren contains the key genes for indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and phenylacetic acid (PAA) biosynthesis, and produces IAA and PAA in vitro, which may impact the ecology or pathogenicity of the fungal pathogen in vivo. En-Cren was observed to move along hyphae of R. solani and on other basidiomycetes and ascomycetes in culture. The bacterial flagellum is essential for hyphal movement, while other pathways and genes may also be involved.\n\nImportanceThe genome characterization and comparative genomics analysis of En-Cren provided the foundation and resources for a better understanding of the ecology and evolution of this EHB in the rhizosphere. The ability to produce IAA and PAA may provide new angles to study the impact of phytohormones during the plant-pathogen interactions. The hitchhiking behavior of the bacterium on a diverse group of fungi, while inhibiting the growth of some others, revealed new areas of bacterial-fungal signaling and interaction yet to be explored.",

Vaccines are administered to protect against diseases caused by BoCoV, but knowledge gaps exist with regards correlates of protection and the effect of immune evasion on driving evolution. Immune epitopes predicted for each structural protein were corroborated with selective pressure analysis and sequencing of genes encoding two surface proteins, spike and haemagglutinin esterase (HE). Eleven of the sixteen predicted spike immune epitopes and three of the six predicted HE immune epitopes overlapped residues under diversifying selection or residues where amino acid changes were found. Four of the nineteen residues predicted to be important for recognition of spike by neutralising antibodies (nAb) were under diversifying selection or amino acid changes were observed. Increased prevalence of amino acid changes in specific immune epitopes suggests an effective immune response recognises these regions as non-synonymous mutations would provide a selective advantage for the virus due to immune escape. Selection analysis and sequencing provided more support for MHC-II, B cell receptor and nAb epitopes and less support for MHC-I epitopes. Downregulation of MHC-I antigen presentation has been demonstrated for several coronaviruses and the reduced support for predicted MHC-I epitopes, compared to other immune epitopes, suggests this could also be true for BoCoV.",

We postulated that a unique rhizospheric fungal community would be created when growing crops on chernevaya soil, which has never been used for agriculture. These may be the source for the novel effective biostimulator and biocontrol fungal agents for modern agriculture. In this study, we analyzed the fungal communities in the rhizosphere of spring wheat and radish cultivated in greenhouse experiments on chernevaya and control soils using high-throughput ITS sequencing. Additionally reprehensive fungal strains were isolated and examined for the stimulation of wheat seedlings growth. The research shows that Ascomycota and Mortierellomycota were the most abundant phyla in the rhizospheric fungal community, mainly composed of Mortierella species. The control soils were abundant in Mucoromycota, represented mostly by Mucor and Umbelopsis. Potentially plant-pathogenic fungi Fusarium and Oidiodendron were found only in the rhizosphere of crops grown in the control soil. Whereas plants grown on chernevaya soil have a wide variety of possible biocontrol fungi. Novel fungal isolates demonstrated stimulating effect on the growth and biomass accumulation of wheat seedlings. The findings of the study imply that the creation of biorational products for crop growth and protection may depend on the taxonomic composition analysis of the rhizospheric mycobiota of the crops growing on the soil with the unique characteristics.",

We also examined the effects of a two-week tooth brushing treatment on bacterial microbiome in 9 dogs diagnosed with PD. We revealed that PD severity in dogs correlates with age. As PD severity increased, the prevalence of Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Treponema, and Moraxella rose, while Conchiformibius, Neisseria, Actinomyces, and Pasteurella declined. Linear discriminant effective size (LEfSe) analysis suggests that Conchiformibius may be linked to oral health, while Porphyromonas is associated with PD progression. Notably, brushing with a gel may reduce the prevalence of Porphyromonas. Further studies are warranted to explore PD prevention or treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "In mammals, 5 methyl-cytosine (5mC) and Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)-deposited histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) are generally mutually exclusive at CpG-rich regions. As mouse embryonic stem cells exit the naive pluripotent state, there is a massive gain of 5mC coincident with a restriction of broad H3K27me3 to 5mC-free, CpG-rich regions. To formally assess how 5mC shapes the H3K27me3 landscape, we profiled the epigenome of naive and differentiated cells in the presence and absence of the DNA methylation machinery. Surprisingly, we found that 5mC accumulation is not required to restrict most H3K27me3 domains. We went on to show that this 5mC-independent H3K27me3 restriction is mediated by aberrant expression of the PRC2 antagonist Ezhip. At the regions where 5mC appears to genuinely supplant H3K27me3, we identified 68 candidate genes that appeared to require 5mC deposition and/or H3K27me3 depletion for their activation in differentiated cells. Employing site-directed epigenome editing to directly modulate 5mC levels, we demonstrated that 5mC deposition is sufficient to antagonize H3K27me3 deposition and confer gene activation at individual candidates. Altogether, we systematically measured the antagonistic interplay between 5mC and H3K27me3 in a system that recapitulates early embryonic dynamics. Our results suggest that H3K27me3 restraint depends on 5mC, both directly and indirectly. This study also reveals a non-canonical role of 5mC in gene activation, which may be important not only for normal development but also for cancer progression, as oncogenic cells frequently exhibit dynamic replacement of 5mC for H3K27me3 and vice versa.",

    "abstract": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) represent a class of widespread endogenous RNAs that regulate gene expression and thereby influence cell biological decisions with implications for the pathogenesis of several diseases. Here, we disclose a novel gene-regulatory role of circHIPK3 by combining analyses of large genomics datasets and mechanistic cell biological follow-up experiments. Specifically, we use temporal depletion of circHIPK3 or specific RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and identify several perturbed genes by RNA sequencing analyses. Using expression-coupled motif analyses of mRNA expression data from various knockdown experiments, we identify an 11-mer motif within circHIPK3, which is also enriched in genes that become downregulated upon circHIPK3 depletion. By mining eCLIP datasets, we find that the 11-mer motif constitutes a strong binding site for IGF2BP2 and validate this circHIPK3-IGF2BP2 interaction experimentally using RNA-immunoprecipitation and competition assays in bladder cancer cell lines. Our results suggest that circHIPK3 and IGF2BP2 mRNA targets compete for binding. Since the identified 11-mer motif found in circHIPK3 is enriched in upregulated genes following IGF2BP2 knockdown, and since IGF2BP2 depletion conversely globally antagonizes the effect of circHIPK3 knockdown on target genes, our results suggest that circHIPK3 can sequester IGF2BP2 as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA), leading to target mRNA stabilization. As an example of a circHIPK3-regulated gene, we focus on the STAT3 mRNA as a specific substrate of IGF2BP2 and validate that manipulation of circHIPK3 regulates IGF2BP2-STAT3 mRNA binding and thereby STAT3 mRNA levels. However, absolute copy number quantifications demonstrate that IGF2BP2 outnumbers circHIPK3 by orders of magnitude, which is inconsistent with a simple 1:1 ceRNA hypothesis. Instead, we show that circHIPK3 can nucleate multiple copies of IGF2BP2, potentially via phase separation, to produce IGF2BP2 condensates. Finally, we show that circHIPK3 expression correlates with overall survival of patients with bladder cancer. Our results are consistent with a model where relatively few cellular circHIPK3 molecules function as inducers of IGF2BP2 condensation thereby regulating STAT3 and other key factors for cell proliferation and potentially cancer progression.",

The PhiKZ genes are transcribed independently from host RNA polymerase (RNAP) by two RNAPs encoded by the phage. The virion RNAP (vRNAP) transcribes early viral genes and must be injected into the cell with phage DNA. The non-virion RNAP (nvRNAP) is composed of early genes products and transcribes late viral genes. In this work, the dynamics of phage RNAPs localization during phage phiKZ infection was studied. We provide direct evidence of PhiKZ vRNAP injection in infected cells and show that it is excluded from the phage nucleus. The nvRNAP is synthesized shortly after the onset of infection and localizes in the nucleus.

    "abstract": "A core goal of phylogenomics is to determine the evolutionary history of a set of species from biological sequence data. Phylogenetic networks are able to describe more complex evolutionary phenomena than phylogenetic trees but are more difficult to accurately reconstruct. Recently, there has been growing interest in developing methods to infer semi-directed phylogenetic networks. As computing such networks can be computationally intensive, one approach to building such networks is to puzzle together smaller networks. Thus, it is essential to have robust methods for inferring semi-directed phylogenetic networks on small numbers of taxa. In this paper, we investigate an algebraic method for performing phylogenetic network inference from nucleotide sequence data on 4-leaved semi-directed phylogenetic networks by analysing the distribution of leaf-pattern probabilities. On simulated data, we found that we can correctly identify with high accuracy semi-directed networks as sequences approach 10Mbp in length, and that we are able to use our approach to identify tree-like evolution and determine the underlying tree. We also applied our approach to published transcriptome data from swordtail fish to compare its performance with a pseudolikelihood method for inferring semi-directed networks.",

To investigate this, we obtained native nucleosomes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae using micrococcal nuclease digestion of chromatin in isolated nuclei and ion-exchange chromatographic purification. The purified nucleosomal fragments robustly reduced Cu2+ to Cu1+ ions, with the optimal activity dependent on the presence of zinc ions. Mutation of the histone H3 histidine 113 (H3H113) residue at the active site substantially reduced the enzymatic activity of nucleosomes, underscoring the catalytic role of histone H3. Consistently, limiting zinc ions reduced intracellular Cu1+ levels and compromised growth, phenotypes that were mitigated by genetically enhancing the copper reductase activity of histone H3. These results indicate that yeast nucleosomes possess copper reductase activity, suggesting that the fundamental unit of eukaryotic chromatin is an enzyme complex.",

    "abstract": "F. graminearum FgSte2 and FgSte3 are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) recently shown to play roles in mediating fungal hyphal chemotropism and plant pathogenesis in response to activity arising from host-released peroxidases. Here, we follow up on the previous observation that chemotropism is dependent on both FgSte2 and FgSte3 being present at the same time; testing the possibility that this effect might be due to formation of an FgSte2-FgSte3 heterodimer. Initially the recombinant cell-surface expression of the F. graminearum GPCRs was validated in S. cerevisiae by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer analyses were subsequently conducted, where the addition of horse radish peroxidase (HRP) was found to increase the transfer of energy from the inducibly-expressed FgSte3-Nano luciferase (FgSte3-NLuc) donor, to the constitutively-expressed FgSte2-yellow fluorescent protein (FgSte2-YFP) acceptor, compared to controls. A partial response was also detected when an HRP-derived ligand-containing extract was enriched from F. graminearum spores and applied to the S. cerevisiae BRET system directly. The selectivity of the interaction was demonstrated by comparison to treatment with pheromones as well as an unrelated bovine GPCR, rhodopsin, fused to YFP as acceptor, that yielded no response when co-expressed with FgSte3-NLuc. Finally, the peroxidase-stimulated heterodimerization was validated by affinity pulldown. Taken together these findings demonstrate the formation of HRP and HRP-derived ligand stimulated heterodimers between FgSte2 and FgSte3. Outcomes are discussed from the context of the roles of ligands and reactive oxygen species in GPCR dimerization.",

These stationary phases are commonly classified on the basis of different form factors namely, beads and monoliths for protein chromatography. Monolithic rods are one of the important geometries derived from polymers through complex polymerization schemes with additional requirements such as cross-linkers and specific reaction conditions. To address these practical difficulties and enable ease of fabrication at laboratory scale, acrylic copolymers are hypothesized to perform as a monolithic stationary phase suitable for protein chromatography. The present work proposes a rapid fabrication technique to obtain monolithic rods that could be reconditioned without any of the above additional steps. It is characterized with monolith diameter that could be controlled using acrylic copolymer concentration. Formation of the copolymeric stationary phase inside microchannel led to annular geometry and in turn, demonstrated fabrication of moon-shaped channels (MSCs) for the first time in literature. An online monitoring system facilitated tracer breakthrough analysis with MSCs to report sharp peak front and an estimate of channel void volume. Breakthrough curves with single protein validated the selection of blue dextran as tracer and indicated retention of proteins due to electrostatic interactions on the functional copolymer surface.",

    "abstract": "General methods for spatiotemporal control of specific endogenous proteins would be broadly useful for probing protein function in living cells. Synthetic protein binders that bind and inhibit endogenous protein targets can be obtained from nanobodies, designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins), and other small protein scaffolds, but generalizable methods to control their binding activity are lacking. Here, we report robust single-chain photoswitchable DARPins (psDARPins) for bidirectional optical control of endogenous proteins. We created topological variants of the DARPin scaffold by computer-aided design so fusion of photodissociable dimeric Dronpa (pdDronpa) results in occlusion of target binding at baseline. Cyan light induces pdDronpa dissociation to expose the binding surface (paratope), while violet light restores pdDronpa dimerization and paratope caging. Since the DARPin redesign leaves the paratope intact, the approach was easily applied to existing DARPins for GFP, ERK, and Ras, as demonstrated by relocalizing GFP-family proteins and inhibiting endogenous ERK and Ras with optical control. Finally, a Ras-targeted psDARPin was used to determine that, following EGF-activation of EGFR, Ras is required for sustained EGFR to ERK signaling. In summary, psDARPins provide a generalizable strategy for precise spatiotemporal dissection of endogenous protein function.",

To achieve an adequate precision in the estimation of this average, hundreds of cells must be analyzed in 2D microscopy images. Currently, this analysis is performed manually, as conventional computer vision techniques struggle with the wide variety of shapes showcased by chromosomes. The false discovery rate of current automated detection systems is high and variable, depending on small variations in data quality (chromosome spread, illumination variations ...), which makes using it in a fully automated fashion impossible. Automating chromosomal aberration is needed to reduce diagnosis time. Furthermore, an automated system can process more images, which improves confidence intervals around the estimated radiation dose. We build an object detection model to automate chromosomal aberration detection using recent advances in deep convolutional neural networks and statistical learning. We formulated the problem of rare aberration detection as a heatmap regression problem requiring the minimization of a sparsity-promoting loss to reduce the false alarm rate. Our Unet-based approach is analoguous to a one-stage object detector, and keeps the number of hyperparameters to a minimum. Finally, we demonstrate large performance improvements using an ensemble of checkpoints collected during a single run of training. A PCA-based strategy is used to provide cues for interpretation of our deep neural network-based model. The methodology is demonstrated on real, large, and challenging datasets depicting rare chromosomal aberrations and is favorably compared to a reference dosimetry technique.",

We show that these gene sequences, which we term \"cell sentences\", can be used to fine-tune causal language models like GPT-2. Critically, we find that natural language pretraining boosts model performance on cell sentence tasks. When fine-tuned on cell sentences, GPT-2 generates biologically valid cells when prompted with a cell type. Conversely, it can also accurately predict cell type labels when prompted with cell sentences. This demonstrates that language models fine-tuned using Cell2Sentence can gain a biological understanding of single-cell data, while retaining their ability to generate text.

    "abstract": "Angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation, is characterized by three essential hallmarks: endothelial proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Each is integral in angiogenesis related diseases, especially cancer. With drug efficacy stagnated due to acquired drug resistance and off target side effects, the need for combinatorial therapy is ever more present. To identify new compounds that could aid current antiangiogenic therapies, we report the preliminary mechanistic evaluation of a 2-bromo-25-dihydroxychalcone analogue and its antimigratory effects on endothelial cells. After the synthesis and validation of the 2-bromo-25-dihydroxychalcone analogue (AH9), its effect was tested in vitro using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Initial investigations into 2-bromo-25-dihydroxychalcone effect in vitro was conducted with a cell proliferation assay including MTT, afterward endothelial migration was measured with the scratch assay in subsequent functional studies. For mechanistic evaluation, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induced ERK phosphorylation using western blot was implemented. AH9 inhibited VEGF-induced ERK [1/2] phosphorylation similar to that of known antiangiogenic drug Sorafenib at all three concentrations 100 M (46%, p = 0.003), 30 M (64%, p = 0.0002) and 10 M (91%, p = 0.0001). In a scratch assay model, whilst sorafenib at 3 M was not able to limit migration after 8-hr compared to an untreated control (p = 0.0978), AH9 did (17.41%, p = 0.0079). Furthermore, AH9 was able to inhibit ERK [1/2] phosphorylation in a concentration dependent manner 100 M (46%, p = 0.003), 30 M (64%, p = 0.0002) and 10 M (91%, p = 0.0001) compared to the VEGF control. These preliminary findings support that AH9 could be exerting antimigratory effects through the inhibition of the VEGF induced MAPK/ERK pathway. This forms the foundation for further studies to explore chalcone analogues in hope to aid current antiangiogenic therapeutic strategies as potential angiogenic inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "The insect endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia pipientis is being utilised as a biocontrol tool to reduce the incidence of Aedes aegypti-transmitted viral diseases like dengue. However, the precise mechanisms underpinning Wolbachias antiviral activity are not well defined. Here we generated a panel of Ae. aegypti-derived cell lines infected with antiviral strains wMel and wAlbB or the non-antiviral strain wPip to understand host cell morphological changes specifically induced by antiviral strains. Antiviral strains were frequently found to be entirely wrapped by the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, while wPip bacteria clustered separately in the host cell cytoplasm. ER-derived lipid droplets (LDs) increased in volume in wMel-and wAlbB-infected cell lines and mosquito tissues compared to cells infected with wPip or Wolbachia-free controls. Inhibition of fatty acid synthase (required for triacylglycerol biosynthesis) reduced LD formation and significantly restored ER-associated dengue virus replication in cells occupied by wMel. Together, this suggests that antiviral Wolbachia strains may specifically alter the lipid composition of the ER to preclude the establishment of DENV replication complexes. Defining Wolbachias antiviral mechanisms will support the application and longevity of this effective biocontrol tool that is already being used at scale.\n\nImportanceAedes aegypti transmits a range of important human pathogenic viruses like dengue. However, infection of Ae. aegypti with the insect endosymbiotic bacterium, Wolbachia, reduces the risk of mosquito to human viral transmission. Wolbachia is being utilized at field sites across more than 13 countries to reduce the incidence of viruses like dengue, but it is not well understood how Wolbachia induces its antiviral effects. To examine this at the subcellular level, we compared how different strains of Wolbachia with varying antiviral strengths, associate with and modify host cell structures. Strongly antiviral strains were found to specifically associate with the host endoplasmic reticulum and induce striking impacts on host cell lipid distribution. Inhibiting Wolbachia-induced lipid redistribution partially restored dengue virus replication demonstrating this is a contributing role for Wolbachias antiviral activity. These findings provide new insights into how antiviral Wolbachia strains associate with and modify Ae. aegypti host cells.",

    "abstract": "Candida albicans is a commensal yeast that has important impacts on host metabolism and immune function, and can establish life-threatening infections in immunocompromised individuals. Previously, C. albicans colonization has been shown to contribute to the progression and severity of alcoholic liver disease. However, relatively little is known about how C. albicans responds to changing environmental conditions in the GI tract of individuals with alcohol use disorder, namely repeated exposure to ethanol. In this study, we repeatedly exposed C. albicans to high concentrations (10% vol/vol) of ethanol--a concentration that can be observed in the upper GI tract of humans following consumption of alcohol. Following this repeated exposure protocol, ethanol small colony (Esc) variants of C. albicans isolated from these populations exhibited increased ethanol tolerance, altered transcriptional responses to ethanol, and cross-resistance/tolerance to the frontline antifungal fluconazole. These Esc strains exhibited chromosomal copy number variations and carried polymorphisms in genes previously associated with the acquisition of fluconazole resistance during human infection. This study identifies a selective pressure that can result in evolution of fluconazole tolerance and resistance without previous exposure to the drug.\n\nAuthor SummaryPrevious work has shown that Candida albicans, a common fungal component of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome, is found in high abundance in the alcoholic GI tract. However, it was unknown how repeated ethanol exposure, similar to what C. albicans would be exposed to in the upper GI tract of individuals with alcohol use disorder, would affect the yeast. In this work, we show that repeated ethanol exposure selects for C. albicans strains with altered transcriptional responses to ethanol, increased ethanol tolerance, and cross-resistance/tolerance to the common frontline antifungal fluconazole. This work shows that ethanol exposure can promote evolution of C. albicans to antifungal resistance without previous exposure to the antifungal drug. These findings could be relevant to C. albicans in the upper GI tract in individuals with alcohol use disorder and further studies could reveal optimized antifungal regimens for C. albicans infections in these patients.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is a highly common stress for cells, which targets proteins with oxidation of cysteine residues. The thioredoxin (Trx) system, which is a ubiquitous system for thiol- and protein-repair, is composed of a thioredoxin (TrxA) and a thioredoxin-reductase (TrxB). TrxAs reduce disulfide bonds of oxidized proteins and are then usually recycled by a single pleiotropic NAD(P)H-dependent TrxB (NTR). However, some Clostridia have also ferredoxin-dependent TrxBs.\n\nIn this work, we first analyzed the composition of Trx systems across Bacteria. Most of bacteria have only one NTR, but organisms in some Phyla including Firmicutes have several TrxBs. In Firmicutes, this multiplicity of TrxBs is observed only in Clostridia. We thus used Clostridioides difficile as a model to investigate the biological relevance of TrxB multiplicity by studying the physiological roles of the Trx systems in this gut pathogen. Three TrxAs and three TrxBs are present in the 630{Delta}erm strain. We showed that two systems were involved in response to infection-related stresses, allowing survival of vegetative cells to exposure to oxygen, inflammation-related molecules and bile salts. A supplementary TrxB copy present in some C. difficile strains also contributes to this stress-response arsenal. One of the conserved stress-response Trx system was also found to be present in the spore via a dual transcriptional control by different sigma factors. This system contributes to spore survival to hypochlorite and ensure proper germination in the presence of oxygen. Finally, we found that the third Trx system was contributing to sporulation. This involvement was likely linked to the recycling of the glycine-reductase, a Stickland pathway enzyme that allows consumption of glycine, a spore co-germinant.\n\nAltogether, our results showed that the multiplicity of Trx systems produced under the control of different regulatory signals and networks and the diversity of TrxBs meet specific needs of Clostridia, i.e., adaptation to strong stress exposure, sporulation and Stickland pathways. More broadly, this multiplicity responds to cell compartmentation and differentiation, which can be transposed to other multiple-TrxBs organisms such as Cyanobacteria or eukaryotes.",

The knowledge of the sinking microeukaryotic communities and their dynamics is limited. We applied 18S rDNA metabarcoding method to investigate the microeukaryotic communities in sinking and suspended particles distinguished by marine snow catchers (MSC) during spring in the Oyashio region. Sinking particles displayed distinct communities and lower diversity than did suspended particles. The community compositions of the sinking particles varied with depth, suggesting that microeukaryotes were selectively removed through disaggregation or decomposition during settling. Prymnesiophyceae and diatoms were effectively removed, as indicated by their decreased abundance in the sinking particles at increasing depths. Conversely, phototrophic dinoflagellates maintained a higher abundance in the sinking particles across depths, indicating resistance to disaggregation and decomposition. Heterotrophic dinoflagellates and Spirotrichea were enriched in sinking particles and marine stramenopiles (MAST) groups were enriched in suspended particles. Sinking heterotrophic protist communities in the deep layers were similar to those in the surface layers, whereas they differed from the suspended ones in the same layer. Therefore, heterotrophic protists in surface layers were transported to deeper layers.

In this study we developed the helicase activity reporter for translation (HART) which uses DDX3X-sensitive 5' UTRs to measure DDX3X mediated translational activity in cells. To dissect the structural underpinnings of DDX3X dependent translation, we first used SHAPE-MaP to determine the secondary structures present in DDX3X-sensitive 5' UTRs and then employed HART to investigate how their perturbation impacts DDX3X-sensitivity. Additionally, we identified residues 38-44 as potential mediators of DDX3Xs interaction with the translational machinery. HART revealed that both DDX3Xs association with the ribosome complex as well as its helicase activity are required for its function in promoting the translation of DDX3X-sensitive 5' UTRs. These findings suggest DDX3X plays a crucial role regulating translation through its interaction with the translational machinery during ribosome scanning, and establish the HART reporter as a robust, lentivirally encoded measurement of DDX3X-dependent translation in cells.",

    "abstract": "The role of seaweeds in the blue bioeconomy has stimulated research efforts around the world but proper species identification and biodiversity assessments, remain a challenge. The South African coast hosts the confluence of the Indian Ocean and Atlantic Ocean, creating a dynamic evolutionary environment that has over time yielded a rich diversity of seaweeds with the highest seaweed diversity occurring along the Agulhas Marine Province. Although South Africa harbours one of the richer seaweed floras in the world, only 24% of the known species are represented by DNA barcodes. We therefore initiated the construction of a taxonomically guided DNA reference library for seaweeds in South Africa with the aim of continuously adding to it in the future. To do this, a seaweed biodiversity survey of the Rhodophyta occurring along a temperate-tropical biogeographic transition zone situated within the Agulhas Marine Province (AMP) in South Africa was carried out. Seaweeds were identified in the field using available field or taxonomic guides and herbarium vouchers were prepared. Subsamples were preserved for DNA analyses and three DNA barcodes (LSU D2-D3; rbcL-3P; COI 5P) were amplified. Sequences were verified on BLAST and preliminary phylogenetic analyses or comparison with the literature were carried out where necessary. A total of 220 barcodes was generated for 88 species and one species variety, including 17 species from or near their type localities and eight generitypes. Novel barcodes were generated for 73 species, nearly half of which were species endemic to Southern Africa. In addition, 21 taxa representing new, potentially new, or reinstated species and at least two new genera were identified as well as one new distribution recorded, all of which require further study. This study significantly adds to the foundational biodiversity knowledge of the South African seaweed flora and highlights new avenues for further research.",

Recently, we demonstrated that inhibitors of phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase alpha (PI3K) may be a useful therapy for patients undergoing HO. In this study, using the already marketed BYL719/Alpelisib/Piqray drug, we have confirmed further these results, detailed the underlying mechanisms of action, and optimized the timing of the administration of BYL719. We found that BYL719 effectively prevents HO even when administered up to three to seven days after injury. We demonstrate in cell cultures and in a mouse model of HO that the major actions of BYL719 are on-target effects through the inhibition of PI3K, without directly affecting ACVR1 or FOP- inducing ACVR1R206H kinase activities. In vivo, we found that a lack of PI3K in progenitors at injury sites is sufficient to prevent HO. Moreover, time course assays in HO lesions demonstrate that BYL719 not only blocks osteochondroprogenitor specification, but also reduces the inflammatory response. BYL719 inhibits the migration, proliferation and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in monocytes and mast cells, suggesting that BYL719 hampers the hyper-inflammatory status of HO lesions. Altogether, these results highlight the potential of PI3K inhibition as a safe and effective therapeutic strategy for HO.",

Here, we applied phylogenetic eigenvector mapping, an approach not previously used for microorganisms, to predict key traits of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), which are important players in nitrogen cycling. Using 168 nearly complete AOA genomes and metagenome assembled genomes from public databases, we predicted the distribution of 18 ecologically relevant genes across an updated amoA gene phylogeny, including a novel variant of an ammonia transporter found in this study. Of the selected genes, 94% displayed a significant phylogenetic signal and gene presence was predicted with >88% accuracy, >88% sensitivity, and >80% specificity. The phylogenetic eigenvector approach performed equally well as ancestral state reconstruction of traits. We implemented the predictive models on an amoA sequencing dataset of AOA soil communities and show key ecological predictions, e.g., that AOA communities in nitrogen rich soils have capacity for ureolytic metabolism while those adapted to low pH soils have the high affinity ammonia transporter (amt2). Predicting genomic traits can shed light on the potential functions that microbes perform across earth biomes, further contributing to a better mechanistic understanding of their community assembly.",

    "abstract": "Whole genome duplication (WGD, polyploidization), the fusion of unreduced gametes, has been identified as a driver of genetic and phenotypic novelty. Unreduced gamete formation is common in a wide range of species, but surprisingly, few polyploidization events have shown to be ecologically successful. Positive density dependence, by minority cytotype exclusion, and niche shifts are currently considered the most important drivers behind ecological failure or success. Genome doubling also results in increased cell sizes and metabolic expenses which, on their own may be sufficient to drive polyploid establishment in stable environments where their simple ancestors thrive.\n\nWe developed a mechanistic model, motivated by data from natural plant polyploid species, to test whether realistic changes in size and metabolic efficiency allow polyploids to coexist with, or even invade, their original diploid population. Central to the model is metabolic efficiency, a functional trait that determines how energy gained from size-dependent photosynthetic metabolism is allocated to basal metabolism, somatic growth and reproductive growth.\n\nPolyploid invasion was observed across a wide range of metabolic efficiency differences between polyploids and their ancestors. Higher metabolic efficiency facilitates polyploid invasion, but even with minor deficits, establishment was facilitated by recurrent formation in these settings of high competition for nutrients. Interestingly, a long-term coexistence with the diploid ancestor was found to be possible only within a narrow range of this parameter space. Perenniality of the plants did not qualitatively affect these insights. Feedbacks between size-dependent metabolism and allocation of gained energy generated eventually size and age differences, resulting in intra- and intercytotype competition for nutrients as the major force for population dynamics. We thus demonstrate that changes in metabolic efficiency on their own are sufficient to impose establishment, but these advantages do not need to be substantial.",

The 3D genome is distinct for each cell type, and it is uncertain whether cell lines faithfully recapitulate the 3D architecture of primary human cells or whether developmental aspects of the pediatric immune system require use of pediatric samples. We undertook a systematic analysis of B cells and B cell lines to compare 3D genomic features encompassing risk loci for juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), systemic lupus (SLE), and type 1 diabetes (T1D).\n\nMethodsWe isolated B cells from healthy individuals, ages 9-17. HiChIP was performed using CTCF antibody, and CTCF peaks were identified. CTCF loops within the pediatric were compared to three datasets: 1) self-called CTCF consensus peaks called within the pediatric samples, 2) ENCODEs publicly available GM12878 CTCF ChIP-seq peaks, and 3) ENCODEs primary B cell CTCF ChIP-seq peaks from two adult females. Differential looping was assessed within the pediatric samples and each of the three peak datasets.\n\nResultsThe number of consensus peaks called in the pediatric samples was similar to that identified in ENCODEs GM12878 and primary B cell datasets. We observed <1% of loops that demonstrated significantly differential looping between peaks called within the pediatric samples themselves and when called using ENCODE GM12878 peaks. Significant looping differences were even less when comparing loops of the pediatric called peaks to those of the ENCODE primary B cell peaks. When querying loops found in juvenile idiopathic arthritis, type 1 diabetes, or systemic lupus erythematosus risk haplotypes, we observed significant differences in only 2.2%, 1.0%, and 1.3% loops, respectively, when comparing peaks called within the pediatric samples and ENCODE GM12878 dataset. The differences were even less apparent when comparing loops called with the pediatric vs ENCODE adult primary B cell peak datasets.The 3D chromatin architecture in B cells is similar across pediatric, adult, and EBVtransformed cell lines. This conservation of 3D structure includes regions encompassing autoimmune risk haplotypes.\n\nConclusionThus, even for pediatric autoimmune diseases, publicly available adult B cell and cell line datasets may be sufficient for assessing effects exerted in the 3D genomic space.",

    "abstract": "In recent years machine learning has transformed many aspects of the drug discovery process including small molecule design for which the prediction of the bioactivity is an integral part. Leveraging structural information about the interactions between a small molecule and its protein target has great potential for downstream machine learning scoring approaches, but is fundamentally limited by the accuracy with which protein:ligand complex structures can be predicted in a reliable and automated fashion.\n\nWith the goal of finding practical approaches to generating useful kinase:inhibitor complex geometries for downstream machine learning scoring approaches, we present a kinase-centric docking benchmark assessing the performance of different classes of docking and pose selection strategies to assess how well experimentally observed binding modes are recapitulated in a realistic crossdocking scenario. The assembled benchmark data set focuses on the well-studied protein kinase family and comprises a subset of 589 protein structures co-crystallized with 423 ATP-competitive ligands. We find that the docking methods biased by the co-crystallized ligand--utilizing shape overlap with or without maximum common substructure matching--are more successful in recovering binding poses than standard physics-based docking alone. Also, docking into multiple structures significantly increases the chance to generate a low RMSD docking pose. Docking utilizing an approach that combines all three methods (Posit) into structures with the most similar co-crystallized ligands according to shape and electrostatics proofed to be the most efficient way to reproduce binding poses achieving a success rate of 66.9 % across all included systems.\n\nThe studied docking and pose selection strategies--which utilize the OpenEye Toolkit--were implemented into pipelines of the KinoML framework allowing automated and reliable protein:ligand complex generation for future downstream machine learning tasks. Although focused on protein kinases, we believe the general findings can also be transferred to other protein families.",
