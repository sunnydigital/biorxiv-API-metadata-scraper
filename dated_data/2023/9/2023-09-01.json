    "abstract": "-Synuclein aggregation is a common trait in synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease. Being an unstructured protein, -synuclein exists in several distinct conformational intermediates, contributing to both its function and pathogenesis. However, the regulation of these monomer conformations by biochemical factors and potential drugs has remained elusive. In this study, we devised an in-situ single-molecule manipulation approach to pinpoint kinetically stable conformational intermediates of monomeric -synuclein and explore the effects of various biochemical factors and drugs. We uncovered a partially folded conformation located in the non-amyloid-{beta} component (NAC) region of monomeric -synuclein, which is regulated by preNAC region. This conformational intermediate is sensitive to biochemical perturbations and small-molecule drugs that influencing -synuclein's aggregation tendency. Our findings reveal that this partially folded intermediate may play a role in -synuclein aggregation, offering fresh perspectives for potential treatments aimed at the initial stage of higher-order -synuclein aggregation. The single-molecule approach developed here can be broadly applied to the study of disease-related intrinsically disordered proteins.",

    "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines have produced protective immunity sufficient enough to cause a decrease in hospitalizations and deaths; however, the pandemic continues due to mutational events, predominantly occurring in the S1 sequence of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. We have developed a baculovirus-expressed, modified S1 SARS-CoV-2 protein based on the C.1.2 variant, which was first identified in South Africa.1 This was encapsulated in a vitamin E containing, nonphospholipid liposome, which was then used to subcutaneously immunize Syrian hamsters. This vaccine, when administered at day 1 generates IgG responses that react to the modified C.1.2 S1 protein; full-length spike proteins from Wuhan-Hu-1, Delta, Omicron BA.1; and the Omicron recombinant variant XBB.1.5 in 100% of the animals. The second dose administered subcutaneously on day 28 demonstrated anamnestic response in the quantitative IgG assay to the Wuhan-Hu-1 spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD). In addition, antibody IgA and IgM responses in sera were demonstrated. Serum IgG antibody responses to the spike proteins of the modified C.1.2 S1 and full-length spike proteins Wuhan-Hu-1, Delta, Omicron BA.1, and Omicron recombinant XBB.1.5 variants are elevated for over 120 days. Challenge of vaccinated and unvaccinated hamsters at day 126 of the study with an Omicron BA.1 resulted in a difference in weight change and viral load based on the qRT-PCR assay seven days after challenge.",

    "abstract": "Parapoxviruses (PPV) cause skin and mucous membrane lesions in several animal species, and of the five recognized PPVs, at least three are zoonotic. Equine PPV (EqPPV) is the sixth one initially described in humans in the United States and later in a severely sick horse in Finland in 2013-2015. In 2021-2022, a large-scale pustulo-vesicular pastern dermatitis outbreak occurred in horses all over Finland. This study aimed at analysing the outbreak, identifying and describing the causative agent, describing clinical signs, and searching for risk factors. EqPPV was identified as a probable causative agent and co-infections with several potentially pathogenic and zoonotic bacteria were observed. Histopathologically, suppurative and ulcerative dermatitis was diagnosed. Due to the lack of specific tests for this virus, we developed a novel diagnostic EqPPV-PCR with sensitivity of 10 copies/reaction. Based on a large proportion of the genome sequenced directly from clinical samples, very little variation was detected between the sequences of the case from 2013 and the cases from 2021-2022. Based on an epidemiological survey, the main risk factor for pastern dermatitis was having racehorses. Approximately one third of the horses at each affected stable got clinical dermatitis, manifesting as severe skin lesions. Skin lesions were also occasionally reported in humans, indicating potential zoonotic transmission. Case stables commonly reported attendance in race events before acquiring the disease. Survey also identified differences in practises between case and control stables. Taken together, these results enable a better preparedness, diagnostics, and guidelines for future outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "EG.5.1 is a subvariant of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron XBB variant that is rapidly increasing in prevalence worldwide. EG.5.1 has additional substitutions in its spike protein (namely, Q52H and F456L) compared with XBB.1.5. However, the pathogenicity, transmissibility, and immune evasion properties of clinical isolates of EG.5.1 are largely unknown. In this study, we used wild-type Syrian hamsters to investigate the replicative ability, pathogenicity, and transmissibility of a clinical EG.5.1 isolate. Our data show that there are no obvious differences in growth ability and pathogenicity between EG.5.1 and XBB.1.5, and both EG.5.1 and XBB.1.5 are attenuated compared to a Delta variant isolate. We also found that EG.5.1 is transmitted more efficiently between hamsters compared with XBB.1.5. In addition, unlike XBB.1.5, we detected EG.5.1 virus in the lungs of four of six exposed hamsters, suggesting that the virus tropism of EG.5.1 is different from that of XBB.1.5 after airborne transmission. Finally, we assessed the neutralizing ability of plasma from convalescent individuals and found that the neutralizing activity against EG.5.1 was slightly, but significantly, lower than that against XBB.1.5 or XBB.1.9.2. This suggests that EG.5.1 effectively evades humoral immunity and that the amino acid differences in the S protein of EG.5.1 compared with that of XBB.1.5 or XBB.1.9.2 (i.e., Q52H, R158G, and F456L) alter the antigenicity of EG.5.1. Our data suggest that the increased transmissibility and altered antigenicity of EG.5.1 may be driving its increasing prevalence over XBB.1.5 in the human population.",

    "abstract": "Polymicrobial infection with Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus may result in a concomitant increase in virulence and resistance to antimicrobial drugs. This enhanced pathogenicity phenotype is mediated by numerous factors including metabolic processes and direct interaction of S. aureus with C. albicans hyphae. The overall structure of biofilms is known to contribute to their recalcitrance to treatment, however the dynamics of direct interaction between species and how it contributes to pathogenicity is poorly understood. To address this, a novel time-lapse mesoscopic optical imaging method was developed to enable the formation of C. albicans/S. aureus whole dual-species biofilms to be followed. It was found that yeast-form or hyphal-form C. albicans in the biofilm founder-population profoundly affects the structure of the biofilm as it matures. Different sub-populations of C. albicans and S. aureus arise within each biofilm as a result of the different C. albicans morphotypes, resulting in distinct sub-regions. These data reveal that C. albicans cell morphology is pivotal in the development of global biofilm architecture and the emergence of colony macrostructures and may temporally influence synergy in infection.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence points to the microbial exposome as a critical factor in maturing and shaping the host immune system, thereby influencing responses to immune challenges such as infections or vaccines. To investigate the effect of early-life viral exposures on immune development and vaccine responses, we inoculated mice with six distinct viral pathogens in sequence beginning in the neonatal period, and then evaluated their immune signatures before and after intramuscular or intranasal vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. Sequential viral infection drove profound changes in all aspects of the immune system, including increasing circulating leukocytes, altering innate and adaptive immune cell lineages in tissues, and markedly influencing serum cytokine and total antibody levels. Beyond these immune responses changes, these exposures also modulated the composition of the endogenous intestinal microbiota. Although sequentially-infected mice exhibited increased systemic immune activation and T cell responses after intramuscular and intranasal SARS-CoV-2 immunization, we observed decreased vaccine-induced antibody responses in these animals. These results suggest that early-life viral exposures are sufficient to diminish antibody responses to vaccination in mice, and highlight their potential importance of considering prior microbial exposures when investigating vaccine responses.",

Folding begins during synthesis, guided by interactions of the nascent protein with the ribosome and molecular chaperones. However, the timing and progression of co-translational folding remain largely elusive, in part because the process is difficult to measure in the natural environment of the cytosol. We developed a high-throughput method to quantify co-translational folding in live cells that we term Arrest Peptide profiling (AP profiling). We employed AP profiling to delineate co-translational folding for a set of GTPase domains with very similar structures, defining how topology shapes folding pathways. Genetic ablation of major nascent chain-binding chaperones resulted in localized folding changes that suggest how functional redundancies among chaperones are achieved by distinct interactions with the nascent protein. Collectively, our studies provide a window into cellular folding pathways of complex proteins and pave the way for systematic studies on nascent protein folding at unprecedented resolution and throughput.",

    "abstract": "The rate at which recombination events occur in a population is an indicator of its effective population size and the organism's reproduction mode. It determines the extent of linkage disequilibrium along the genome and, thereby, the efficacy of both purifying and positive selection. The population recombination rate can be inferred using models of genome evolution in populations. Classical methods based on the patterns of linkage-disequilibrium provide the most accurate estimates, providing large sample sizes are used and the demography of the population is properly accounted for. Here, the capacity of approaches based on the sequentially Markov coalescent (SMC) to infer the genome-average recombination rate from as little as a single diploid genome is examined. SMC approaches provide highly accurate estimates even in the presence of changing population sizes, providing that (1) within genome heterogeneity is accounted for and (2) classical maximum-likelihood optimization algorithms are employed to fit the model. SMC-based estimates proved sensitive to the presence of gene conversion, which leads to an overestimation of the recombination rate if conversion events are frequent. Conversely, methods based on the correlation of heterozygosity succeed in disentangling the rate of crossing over from that of gene conversion events, but only when the population size is constant and the recombination landscape homogeneous. These results call for a convergence of these two methods to obtain accurate and comparable estimates of recombination rates between populations.",

    "abstract": "Ancestral state estimation is a formal phylogenetic method for inferring the nature of ancestors and performing tests of character evolution. As such, it is among the most important tools available to evolutionary biologists. However, there are a profusion of methods available, the accuracy of which remains unclear. Here I use a simulation approach to test between parsimony and likelihood methods for estimating ancestral states from discrete binary characters. I simulate 500 characters using 15 different Markov generating models, a range of tree sizes (8-256 tips) and three topologies representing end members of tree symmetry and branch length heterogeneity. Simulated tip states were subject to ancestral state estimation under the Equal Rates (ER) and All-Rates-Different (ARD) models, as well as under parsimony assuming accelerated transformations (ACCTRAN). The results demonstrate that both parsimony and likelihood approaches obtain high accuracy applied to trees with more tips. Parsimony performs poorly when trees contain long branches, whereas the ER model performs well across simulations and is reasonably robust to model violation. The ER model frequently outperforms the ARD model, even when data are simulated using unequal rates. Furthermore, the ER model exhibits less transition rate error when compared to ER models. These results suggest that ARD models may be overparameterized when character data is limited. Surprisingly, difference in error between likelihood models is a poor predictor of difference in model fitness; better fitting models are not necessarily more accurate. However there is a strong correlation between model uncertainty and model error; likelihood models with more certain ancestral state estimates are typically more accurate. Using empirical morphological datasets, I demonstrate that applying different methods often results in substantively different ancestral state estimates. However, ER ancestral state estimates are frequently supported by either parsimony or ARD estimates. Finally, I highlight the importance of incorporating fossils in ancestral state estimation. Fossils increase the total number of tips, break long branches and lower average branch length and overall branch length heterogeneity of trees. These factors will all contribute to increasing the accuracy of ancestral state estimates, irrespective of the method used.",

    "abstract": "PVD neuron of C. elegans has become an attractive model for the study of dendrite development and regeneration due to the elaborate and stereotype dendrite morphology in this neuron. The molecular basis for dendrite maintenance and regeneration is poorly understood. RNA interference (RNAi) by feeding E. coli expressing dsRNA has been the basis of several genome wide screens performed using C. elegans. However, the feeding method often fails when it comes to nervous system. Using an optimal induction condition for the dsRNA expression in E coli, we fed the worm strains with HT115 bacteria expressing dsRNA against genes like mec-3, hpo-30, and tiam-1, whose loss of function are known to show dendrite morphology defects in PVD neuron. We found that RNAi of these genes in the strains such as nre-1(-) lin-15b(-), lin-15b(-) and sid-1(-); lin-15b(-); Punc-119::sid-1[+] resulted in significant reduction of dendrite branching. However, the phenotypes were significantly modest compared to the respective loss of function mutants. To obtain stronger phenotype for PVD specific genes, we have made a strain, which strongly expresses sid-1 under mec-3 promoter specific for PVD. When Pmec-3::sid-1 is expressed in either nre-1(-);lin-15b(-) or lin-15b(-) background, the higher order branching phenotype after RNAi of mec-3, hpo-30, and tiam-1 was significantly enhanced as compared to nre-1(-);lin-15b(-) and lin-15b(-) background alone. Next we tested the nre-1(-) lin-15b(-), Pmec-3-sid-1[+] strain for the knockdown of genes playing role in dendrite regeneration process. We found that when aff-1 and ced-10 genes were knocked down in the nre-1(-) lin-15b(-), Pmec-3-sid-1[+] background, the dendrite regeneration was significantly reduced and the extent of reduction was comparable to that of the mutants of aff-1 and ced-10. Essentially, our strain expressing sid-1 in PVD neuron optimizes the condition for RNAi for high throughput screening for PVD development, maintenance and regeneration.",

Accurately quantifying codon usage frequencies is useful for a range of applications, from guiding mRNA vaccine design, to elucidating protein folding and uncovering co-evolutionary relationships. However, current methods are either based on a single genome assembly, lack functional stratification, or are extremely outdated. To address this, we adopted a data-driven approach and developed Codon Usage Bias estimation from RNA-sequencing data (CUBSEQ), a fully automatic meta-analysis pipeline to estimate CUB at the trascriptome-level and for gene panels. Here, we used CUBSEQ to perform, to our knowledge, the largest and most comprehensive CUB analysis of the transcriptome and highly expressed genes in Escherichia coli, using RNA sequencing data from 6,763 samples across 72 strains. By capturing sequence variants of these genes through variant calls, we constructed a per-sample representation of the E. coli transcriptome revealing a rich mutational landscape. We then identified a set of 81 highly expressed genes with consistent expression patterns across strains, sample library size and experimental conditions, and found significant differences in CUB compared to transcriptome-wide genes and alternative codon usage tables. Finally, we found codons with a high relative frequency were often associated with a larger repertoire of isoaccepting tRNAs and not necessarily high tRNA abundance.",

The proteomic profiling of entotic cells allowed us to identify LAMP1 as a protein upregulated by Rnd3 silencing and implicated not only in the degradation final stage of entosis, but also in the full mechanism.

The survey of 3,726 households across the eight regions of the NCAs provided insights that will inform interventions on order to improve human rabies prevention and Namibia's dog rabies control strategy. The results showed a relatively low average human/dog ratio (HDR) of 5.4:1 indicating a surprisingly high dog population of at least 272,000 dogs in the NCAs, 93% of which appear to be owned but are free-roaming. Data analysis revealed opportunities but also highlighted needs for improvements in rabies surveillance and mass dog vaccinations. Although knowledge, attitude, and practice scores towards epidemiologic and clinical aspects, human rabies prevention, and canine rabies vaccination were deemed to be acceptable, the survey nevertheless revealed deficiencies in some of the population. Interestingly, data seemed to indicate a certain number of unreported human rabies cases. Other findings included the very high number of dogs. However, only 50% of dog-owning households reported having vaccinated their dogs. In order to address these issues, the planning, announcement, and implementation of mass dog vaccination campaigns need to be adapted to achieve adequate vaccination coverage. Another focus needs to be on rabies awareness and education if Namibia is to be significantly contributing to the global goal of \"Zero by 30\".",

    "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite that infects a broad spectrum of hosts and can colonize many organs and cell types. The ability to reside within a wide range of different niches requires substantial adaptability to diverse microenvironments. Very little is known about how this parasite senses various milieus and adapts its metabolism to survive, replicate during the acute stage, and then differentiate to the chronic stage. Most eukaryotes, from yeast to mammals, rely on a nutrient sensing machinery involving the TORC complex as master regulator of cell growth and cell cycle progression. The lysosome functions as a signaling hub where TORC complex assembles and is activated by transceptors, which both sense and transport amino acids, including the arginine transceptor SLC38A9. While most of the TORC components are lost in T. gondii, indicating the evolution of a distinct nutrient sensing mechanism, the parasites lysosomal plant-like vacuolar compartment (PLVAC) may still serve as a sensory platform for controlling parasite growth and differentiation. Using SLC38A9 to query the T. gondii proteome, we identified four putative amino acid transporters, termed TgAAT1-4, that structurally resemble the SLC38A9 arginine transceptor. Assessing their expression and sub-cellular localization, we found that one of them, TgAAT1, localized to the PLVAC and is necessary for normal parasite extracellular survival and bradyzoite differentiation. Moreover, we show that TgAAT1 is involved in the PLVAC efflux of arginine, an amino acid playing a key role in T. gondii differentiation, further supporting the hypothesis that TgAAT1 might play a role in nutrient sensing.",

In lambda and Shiga toxin-producing phages found in enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) associated with food poisoning, Ea22 favors a lysogenic over lytic developmental state. The Ea22 protein may be considered in terms of three domains: a short amino-terminal domain, a coiled-coiled domain, and a carboxy-terminal domain (CTD). While the full-length protein is tetrameric, the CTD is dimeric when expressed individually. Here, we report the NMR solution structure of the Ea22 CTD that is described by a mixed alpha-beta fold with a dimer interface reinforced by salt bridges. A conserved mobile loop may serve as a ligand for an unknown host protein that works with Ea22 to promote bacterial survival and the formation of new lysogens. From sequence and structural comparisons, the CTD distinguishes lambda Ea22 from homologs encoded by Shiga toxin-producing bacteriophages.",

    "abstract": "The EF-hand calcium (Ca2+) sensor protein S100A1 combines inotropic with antiarrhythmic potency in cardiomyocytes (CM). Oxidative posttranslational modification (ox-PTM) of S100A1's conserved, single cysteine residue (C85) via reactive nitrogen species (i.e. S-nitrosylation or glutathionylation) was proposed to modulate conformational flexibility of intrinsically disordered sequence fragments and to increase the molecule's affinity towards Ca2+. In light of the unknown biological functional consequence, we aimed to determine the impact of the C85 moiety of S100A1 as a potential redox-switch. We first uncovered that S100A1 is endogenously glutathionylated in the adult heart in vivo. To prevent glutathionylation of S100A1, we generated S100A1 variants that were unresponsive to ox-PTMs. Overexpression of wildtype (WT) and C85-deficient S100A1 protein variants in isolated CM demonstrated equal inotropic potency, as shown by equally augmented Ca2+ transient amplitudes under basal conditions and {beta}-adrenergic receptor ({beta}AR) stimulation. However, in contrast ox-PTM defective S100A1 variants failed to protect against arrhythmogenic diastolic sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ leak and ryanodine receptor (RyR2) hypernitrosylation during {beta}-AR stimulation. Despite diastolic performance failure, C85-deficient S100A1 protein variants exerted similar Ca2+-dependent interaction with the RyR2 than WT-S100A1. Dissecting S100A1's molecular structure-function relationship, our data indicate for the first time that the conserved C85 residue potentially acts as a redox-switch that is indispensable for S100A1's antiarrhythmic but not its inotropic potency in CM. We therefore propose a model where C85's ox-PTM determines S100A1's ability to beneficially control diastolic but not systolic RyR2 activity.",

We first review the motif and then describe how it is linked to the hydrophobic spine architecture of the kinase core, which we first discovered using a computational tool, Local Spatial Pattern (LSP) alignment. Based on NMR predictions that a mutation in this motif abolishes the synergistic high-affinity binding of ATP and a pseudo substrate inhibitor, we used LSP to interrogate the F100A mutant. This comparison highlights the importance of the C-{beta}4 loop and key residues at the interface between the N- and C-lobes. In addition, we delved more deeply into the structure of the apo C-subunit, which lacks ATP. While apo C-subunit showed no significant changes in backbone dynamics of the C-{beta}4 loop, we found striking differences in the side chain dynamics of K105. The LSP analysis suggests disruption of communication between the N- and C-lobes in the F100A mutant, which would be consistent with the structural changes predicted by the NMR spectroscopy.",

    "abstract": "With 75 known species, the freshwater fish genus Sinocyclocheilus is the largest cavefish radiation in the world, emerging as a model system for evolutionary studies. They show multiple adaptations for cave dwelling (stygomorphic adaptations), which include a range of traits such as eye degeneration (Normal-eyed, Microeyed and Eyeless), depigmentation of skin, and in some species, the presence of horns. Their behavioural adaptations to subterranean environments, however, are poorly understood. Wall-following (WF) behaviour, where an organism remains in close contact with the boundary demarcating its habitat when in the dark, is a peculiar behaviour observed in a wide range of animals and is enhanced in some cave dwellers. Hence, we hypothesize wall-following to be present also in Sinocyclocheilus, possibly enhanced in Eyeless species compared to species with visual cues (Normal / Microeyed species). Using 13 species representative of Sinocyclocheilus radiation and eye-morphs, we designed a series of assays, based on preexisting methods for Astyanax mexicanus behavioural experiments, to examine wall-following behaviour under three stimulation conditions. Our results indicate that eyeless species exhibit significantly enhanced levels of WF compared to Normal-eyed species, with Micro-eyed forms demonstrating intermediate levels. Using a mtDNA based dated phylogeny (chronogram with four clades A to D), we traced the degree of WF of these forms to outline common patterns. We show that intensity of WF behaviour is high in the subterranean clades (B & C) compared to clades with free-living species (A & D). Experiments on WF behaviour revealed that eyeless species are highly sensitive to vibrations, whereas normal-eyed species are the least sensitive. Since WF behaviour is present to some degree in all Sinocyclocheilus species, and given that these fishes evolved in the late Miocene, we identify this behaviour as being ancestral with WF enhancement related to cave occupation. Our results from this diversification scale study of cavefish behaviour suggest that enhanced wall-following behaviour may be a convergent trait across all stygomorphic cavefish lineages.",

    "abstract": "The sheer diversity of unculturable viruses has prompted the need to describe new viruses through culture-independent techniques. The associated host is one important phenotypic feature that can be inferred from metagenomic viral contigs -- thanks to the development of various bioinformatic tools. Here we compare the performance of recently developed tools for virus-host prediction on a dataset of 1,046 virus-host pairs and then apply the best-performing tools on a metagenomic dataset derived from a highly diverse transiently hypersaline site known as Archaean Domes within the Cuatro Cienegas Basin, Coahuila, Mexico. We also introduce a virus-host prediction tool called CrisprCustomDB, which uses specific criteria to solve controversial host assignments with custom spacers databases. Host-dependent alignment-based methods showed an average precision of 83% and a sensitivity from 13.7% to 17.7%, whereas host-dependent alignment-free methods achieved an average precision of 75.7% and a sensitivity of 57.5%. RaFAH, a virus-dependent alignment-based tool, had the best performance overall (F1_score = 95.7%). However, when applied to the highly diverse metagenomic dataset, the host-dependent alignment-based (e.g., CrisprCustomDB) and alignment-free (e.g., PHP) methods showed the greatest agreement with each other, even though they are fundamentally different methods. This is because instead of depending on known hosts or viruses-with-known-host databases, they can directly relate metagenomic viral contigs and metagenome-assembled genomes from the same dataset. Such methods also showed the greatest consistency between the source environment and the predicted host taxonomy, habitat, lifestyle, or metabolism, revealing that Archaean Domes viruses likely infect halophilic Archaea as well as a variety of Bacteria which may be halophilic, halotolerant, alkaliphilic, thermophilic, oligotrophic, sulfate-reducing or marine-related. Consequently, using a combination of methods and qualitative validations relating to the source environment and the predicted host biology will increase the number of correct predictions, mainly when dealing with novel viruses.",

NPGL and NPGM play important roles in lipid metabolism in juvenile chickens. The physiological functions of NPGL and NPGM in sexually mature birds remain unknown. The Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) seems to be an appropriate model for analyzing NPGL and NPGM during sexual maturity. However, studies on NPGL or NPGM have yet to be reported in the Japanese quail. In the present study, we identified cDNAs encoding precursor proteins of NPGL and NPGM in the quail hypothalamus. In situ hybridization revealed that NPGL mRNA-expressing cells in the hypothalamus were localized in the infundibular nucleus and median eminence, and NPGM mRNA-expressing cells were only found in the mammillary nucleus. Immunohistochemistry revealed that NPGM-like immunoreactive cells were distributed in the mammillary nucleus, whereas NPGL-like immunoreactive cells were not detected in the hypothalamus. Real-time PCR analysis indicated that the expression of NPGL mRNA was higher in the hypothalamus of females than in males, and NPGM mRNA expression showed no sex differences. NPGL and NPGM mRNA expression in males was upregulated after 24 h of food deprivation. In females, only NPGM mRNA expression was increased by fasting. These results suggest that the physiological functions of NPGL and NPGM are different in quail, and these factors are involved in sex differences in energy metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Glycerophospholipids are synthesized primarily in the cytosolic leaflet of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and must be equilibrated between bilayer leaflets to allow the ER and membranes derived from it to grow. Lipid equilibration is facilitated by integral membrane proteins called scramblases. These proteins feature a hydrophilic groove allowing the polar heads of lipids to traverse the hydrophobic membrane interior, similar to a credit-card moving through a reader. Nevertheless, despite their fundamental role in membrane expansion and dynamics, the identity of most scramblases has remained elusive. Here, combining biochemical reconstitution and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that lipid scrambling is a general feature of protein insertases, integral membrane proteins which insert polypeptide chains into membranes of the ER and organelles disconnected from vesicle trafficking. Our data indicate that lipid scrambling occurs in the same hydrophilic channel through which protein insertion takes place, and that scrambling is abolished in the presence of nascent polypeptide chains. We propose that protein insertases could have a so-far overlooked role in membrane dynamics as scramblases.",

A comparison of our assembly and a recent West Indian manatee genome with other afrotherian genomes revealed possible molecular solutions to aquatic life by sirenians, including a shift in daily activity patterns (circadian clock) and tolerance to a high-iodine plant diet mediated through changes in the iodide transporter NIS (SLC5A5) and its co-transporters. Functional in vitro assays confirmed that sirenian amino acid substitutions alter the properties of the circadian clock protein PER2 and NIS. Sirenians show evidence of convergent regression of integumentary system (skin and its appendages) genes with cetaceans, the only other fully aquatic mammal group. Our analysis also uncovered gene losses that may be maladaptive in a modern environment, including a candidate gene (KCNK18) for sirenian cold stress syndrome likely lost during their evolutionary shift in daily activity patterns.

By including only those alleles with a high level of support, including some new sequences that currently lack official names, AIRR-seq analysis will have greater accuracy and studies of the evolution of immunoglobulin genes, their allelic variants and the expressed immune repertoire will be facilitated. Although containing less than half the previously recognised IG alleles (e.g. just 198 IGHV sequences), the Reference Sets eliminated erroneous calls and provided excellent coverage when tested on a set of repertoires from 99 individuals comprising over 4 million V(D)J rearrangements. To improve AIRR-seq analysis, some alleles have been extended to deal with short 3' or 5' truncations that can lead them to be overlooked by alignment utilities. To avoid other challenges for analysis programs, exact paralogs (e.g. IGHV1-69*01 and IGHV1-69D*01) are only represented once in each set, though alternative sequence names are noted in accompanying metadata.

    "abstract": "The use of synchronous kinematic and kinetic data in simulations of human running will typically lead to dynamic inconsistencies (i.e. residual forces and moments) being present. Minimising the residual forces and moments in such simulations is important to ensure plausible model outputs (e.g. joint moments, muscle forces) are obtained. A variety of approaches suitable for residual reduction are available in OpenSim, however a detailed comparison of these is yet to be conducted. This study compared a variety of OpenSim tools applicable for residual reduction in simulations of human running. A series of approaches (i.e. singular and iterative Residual Reduction Algorithm, MocoTrack, AddBiomechanics) designed to reduce residual forces and moments were examined using an existing dataset of 10 male participants running on a treadmill at 5.0 m.s-1 (n = 3 gait cycles per participant). The computational time, resultant residual forces and moments, and output joint kinematics and kinetics from each approach were compared. A computational cost to residual reduction trade-off was identified, where lower residual forces and moments were achieved using approaches that required longer computational times. All of the tested approaches regularly reduced residual forces below recommended thresholds, however only the MocoTrack approach could consistently achieve acceptable levels for residual moments. The AddBiomechanics and MocoTrack approaches produced variable lower and upper body kinematics, respectively, versus the remaining approaches; with minimal other qualitative differences were identified between joint kinematics from each approach. Joint kinetics were qualitatively similar between approaches, however MocoTrack generated much noisier joint kinetic signals. The MocoTrack approach was the most consistent and best performing approach for reducing residuals to near-zero levels, at the cost of longer computational times and potentially noisier joint kinetic signals. This study provides OpenSim users with evidence to inform decision-making at the residual reduction step of their modelling and simulation workflow when analysing human running.",

    "abstract": "Protein kinase function and interactions with drugs are controlled in part by the movement of the DFG and C-Helix motifs, which enable kinases to adopt various conformational states. Small molecule ligands elicit therapeutic effects with distinct selectivity profiles and residence times that often depend on the kinase conformation(s) they bind. However, the limited availability of experimentally determined structural data for kinases in inactive states restricts drug discovery efforts for this major protein family. Modern AI-based structural modeling methods hold potential for exploring the previously experimentally uncharted druggable conformational space for kinases. Here, we first evaluated the currently explored conformational space of kinases in the PDB and models generated by AlphaFold2 (AF2) and ESMFold, two prominent AI-based structure prediction methods. We then investigated AF2's ability to predict kinase structures in different conformations at various multiple sequence alignment (MSA) depths, based on this parameter's ability to explore conformational diversity. Our results showed a bias within the PDB and predicted structural models generated by AF2 and ESMFold toward structures of kinases in the active state over alternative conformations, particularly those conformations controlled by the DFG motif. Finally, we demonstrate that predicting kinase structures using AF2 at lower MSA depths allows the exploration of the space of these alternative conformations, including identifying previously unobserved conformations for 398 kinases. The results of our analysis of structural modeling by AF2 create a new avenue for the pursuit of new therapeutic agents against a notoriously difficult-to-target family of proteins.",
