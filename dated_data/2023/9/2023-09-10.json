    "abstract": "Similarities in phenotypic descriptions can be indicative of shared genetics, metabolism, and stress responses, to name a few. Finding and measuring similarity across descriptions of phenotype is not straightforward, with previous successes in computation requiring a great deal of expert data curation. Natural language processing of free text descriptions of phenotype is often less resource intensive than applying expert curation. It is therefore critical to understand the performance of natural language processing techniques for organizing and analyzing biological datasets and for enabling biological discovery. For predicting similar phenotypes, a wide variety of approaches from the natural language processing domain perform as well as curation-based methods. These computational approaches also show promise both for helping curators organize and work with large datasets and for enabling researchers to explore relationships among available phenotype descriptions. Here we generate networks of phenotype similarity and share a web application for querying a dataset of associated plant genes using these text mining approaches. Example situations and species for which application of these techniques is most useful are discussed.\n\nDatabase URLsThe database and analytical tool called QuOATS are available at https://quoats.dill-picl.org/.

    "abstract": "Perception can be refined by experience up to certain limits. It is unclear if perceptual limitations are absolute or could be partially overcome via enhanced neuromodulation and/or plasticity. Recent studies suggest the utility of peripheral nerve stimulation - specifically vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) - for altering neural activity and augmenting experience-dependent plasticity, although little is known about central mechanisms recruited by VNS. Here we developed an auditory discrimination task for mice implanted with a VNS electrode. VNS occurring during behavior gradually improved discrimination abilities beyond the level achieved by training alone. Using two-photon imaging, we identified changes to auditory cortical responses and activation of cortically-projecting cholinergic axons with VNS. Anatomical and optogenetic experiments indicated that VNS could enhance task performance via activation of the central cholinergic system. These results highlight the importance of cholinergic modulation for the efficacy of VNS, perhaps enabling further refinement of VNS methodology for clinical conditions.",

    "abstract": "Radial neuronal migration is a key neurodevelopmental event for proper cortical laminar organization. The multipolar-to-bipolar transition, a critical step in establishing neuronal polarity during radial migration, occurs in the subplate/intermediate zone (SP/IZ), a distinct region of the embryonic cerebral cortex. It has been known that the extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules are enriched in the SP/IZ. However, the molecular constitution and functions of the ECM formed in this region remain poorly understood. Here, we identified neurocan (NCAN) as a major chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan in the SP/IZ. NCAN binds to both radial glial cell-derived tenascin-C (TNC) and hyaluronan (HA), a large linear polysaccharide, forming a ternary complex of NCAN, TNC, and HA in the SP/IZ. Developing cortical neurons make contact with the ternary complex during migration. The enzymatic or genetic disruption of the ternary complex impairs radial migration by suppressing the multipolar-to-bipolar transition. Furthermore, both TNC and NCAN promoted the morphological maturation of cortical neurons in vitro. The present results provide evidence for the cooperative role of neuron- and radial glial cell-derived ECM molecules in cortical development.",

    "abstract": "To understand the dynamic nature of the genome in real-time, the localization and rearrangement of DNA and DNA-binding proteins must be analyzed across the entire nucleus of single living cells. Recently, we developed a new computational light microscopy technique, called high-resolution diffusion mapping (Hi-D), that can accurately detect, classify, and map the types of diffusion and biophysical parameters such as the diffusion constant, anomalous exponent, drift velocity, and physical diffusion models at a high spatial resolution over the entire genome in living cells. Hi-D combines dense optical flow to detect and track local chromatin and protein motion, and Bayesian inference to characterize this local movement at nanoscale resolution. The initial implementation requires solid experience using MATLAB (MathWorks) and computational resources, for instance, access to a computer cluster, to perform the Hi-D analysis. In addition, this implementation takes [~]18-24 hours to analyze a typical imaging stack. To avoid these limitations and emphasize high-performance implementation, we present a customized version called Hi-D-Py. The new implementation is written in the open-source Python programming language and has an option for parallelizing the calculations to run on multi-core CPUs. The functionality of Hi-D-Py is exposed to the users via user-friendly documented Python notebooks. Our efficient implementation reduces the analysis time to less than one hour using a multi-core CPU with a single compute node. We also present different applications of Hi-D for live-imaging of DNA, H2B, and RNA Pol II sequences acquired with spinning disk confocal and super-resolution structured illumination microscopy.",

Previous studies proposed that flux is predominately regulated by metabolite, rather than enzyme, levels. However, the extent to which changes in enzyme levels affect flux throughout the metabolic network remains unclear. Here, we combine available yeast enzyme level, flux data, and metabolic network modeling to demonstrate three paradigms by which enzyme levels are broadly associated with flux: cognate reaction, pathway-level coordination, and flux coupling. We find that the architecture of the metabolic network enables the reach of influence for most enzymes. We implemented enzyme reach as a novel parameter in an enhanced flux potential analysis algorithm, which predicts relative flux levels under different conditions from variations in enzyme expression. This algorithm was tested in yeast and humans. Our study suggests that metabolic network architecture facilitates a broad physiological impact of changes in enzyme levels and may form a foundation for using enzyme expression data for a variety of systems, and eventually, individual cells.",

First studies on underwater acoustic pollution focused, and showed effects, on vertebrates behaviours. Knowledge on the effects on invertebrates is more limited and there is a huge lack concerning zooplankton species, although widely used as bioindicators in chemical pollution. Consequently, it is critical to assess the impact of noise on zooplanktons fitness (survival and fecundity). Here, isolated water fleas, Daphnia magna, were reared from birth to death in the presence or absence of motorboat noises. Effects on lifespan and clonal offspring production (e.g., clutch size, number of offspring produced along life) were assessed and chronic exposure to boat noise did not affect Daphnias fitness. The spectral and temporal features of the sounds could explain the results. This study highlights the importance of integrating noise pollution into ecotoxicological research to understand, and prevent, human impacts on communities.",

    "abstract": "Theoretical models suggest that executive functions rely on both domain-general and domain-specific processes. Supporting this view, prior brain imaging studies have revealed that executive activations converge and diverge within broadly characterized brain networks. However, the lack of precise anatomical mappings has impeded our understanding of the interplay between domain-general and domain-specific processes. To address this challenge, we used the high-resolution multimodal MRI approach of the Human Connectome Project to scan participants performing three canonical executive tasks: n-back, rule switching, and stop signal. The results reveal that, at the individual level, different executive activations converge within 9 domain-general cortical territories. Each task exhibits a unique topography characterized by finely detailed activation gradients within domain-general territory. These gradients peak in strength at borders with adjacent fine-grained resting-state networks. Outside cerebral cortex, matching results are seen in circumscribed regions of the caudate nucleus, thalamus and cerebellum. The shifting peaks of local gradients at the intersection of task-specific networks provide a novel mechanistic insight into how partially-specialised networks interact with neighbouring domain-general territories to generate distinct executive functions.",

    "abstract": "The transition from a lytic to lysogenic life cycle is the most important feature of the life history of temperate viruses. An optimal life-history explanation for this transition is offered based a discrete-time model of phage/bacteria population dynamics featuring infection of bacteria by Poisson sampling of virions from the environment. The time step is the viral latency period. In this model density-dependent viral absorption onto the bacterial surface is sufficient to produce virus/bacteria coexistence and density-dependence in bacterial growth is not needed.\n\nThe formula for the transition from a lytic to lysogenic phase is termed the \"fitness switch\". The virus switches from lytic to lysogenic when its population grows faster as prophage than as virions produced by lysis of the infected cells.\n\nA prophage that benefits the bacterium it infects automatically incurs lower fitness upon leaving the bacterial genome, resulting in its becoming locked into the bacterial genome in what is termed as a \"prophage lock\".\n\nThe fitness switch qualitatively predicts that environmental enrichment leads to microbialization, fluctuating environmental conditions promote horizontal gene transfer (HGT), and prophage-containing bacteria can integrate into the microbiome of a eukaryotic host forming a functionally integrated tripartite holobiont. These predictions accord more with the \"Piggyback-the-Winner\" hypothesis than with the \"Kill-the-Winner\" hypothesis in virus ecology.",

    "abstract": "Reliable detection and classification of bacteria and other pathogens in the human body, animals, food, and water is crucial for improving and safeguarding public health. For instance, identifying the species and its antibiotic susceptibility is vital for effective bacterial infection treatment. Here we show that phase contrast time-lapse microscopy combined with deep learning is sufficient to discriminate four species of bacteria relevant to human health. The classification is performed on living bacteria and does not require fixation or staining, meaning that the bacterial species can be determined as the bacteria reproduce in a microfluidic device, enabling parallel determination of susceptibility to antibiotics. We assess the performance of convolutional neural networks and vision transformers, where the best model attained a class-average accuracy exceeding 98%. Our successful proof-of-principle results suggest that the methods should be challenged with data covering more species and clinically relevant isolates for future clinical use.\n\nAuthor SummaryBacterial infections are a leading cause of premature death worldwide, and growing antibiotic resistance is making treatment increasingly challenging. To effectively treat a patient with a bacterial infection, it is essential to quickly detect and identify the bacterial species and determine its susceptibility to different antibiotics. Prompt and effective treatment is crucial for the patients survival. A microfluidic device functions as a miniature \"lab-on-chip\" for manipulating and analyzing tiny amounts of fluids, such as blood or urine samples from patients. Microfluidic chips with chambers and channels have been designed for quickly testing bacterial susceptibility to different antibiotics by analyzing bacterial growth. Identifying bacterial species has previously relied on killing the bacteria and applying species-specific fluorescent probes. We introduce deep learning models as a fast and cost-effective method for identifying bacteria species directly from phase-contrast microscopy images of living bacteria simultaneously as growth is analyzed. We envision this method being employed concurrently with antibiotic susceptibility tests in future applications, significantly enhancing bacterial infection treatments.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear membrane rupture is a physiological response to multiple in vivo processes, such as cell migration, that can cause extensive genome instability and upregulate invasive and inflammatory pathways. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of rupture are unclear and few regulators have been identified. In this study, we developed a reporter that is size excluded from re-compartmentalization following nuclear rupture events. This allows for robust detection of factors influencing nuclear integrity in fixed cells. We combined this with an automated image analysis pipeline in a high-content siRNA screen to identify new proteins that both increase and decrease nuclear rupture frequency in cancer cells. Pathway analysis identified an enrichment of nuclear membrane and ER factors in our hits and we demonstrate that one of these, the protein phosphatase CTDNEP1, is required for nuclear stability. Further analysis of known rupture contributors, including a newly developed automated quantitative analysis of nuclear lamina gaps, strongly suggests that CTDNEP1 acts in a new pathway. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of nuclear rupture and define a highly adaptable program for rupture analysis that removes a substantial barrier to new discoveries in the field.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic {beta}-cells are critical for systemic glucose homeostasis, and most of them undergo cell death during the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. We previously showed that a Na+ channel inhibitor, carbamazepine, could protect {beta}-cells in vitro and in vivo. Here, we confirmed the effects of carbamazepine and other Na+ channel inhibitors on human islets and focused on the specific role of the Na+ channel gene, Scn9a (Nav1.7), in {beta}-cell function and survival. Because Scn9a can be found in multiple human and mouse islet cell types, we generated a {beta}-cell specific knockout of Scn9a on the non-obese diabetic (NOD) background. We crossed an Scn9aflox/flox allele onto the Ins1Cre knock-in mouse line resulting in the following genotypes: knockout (NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9aflox/flox), heterozygous (NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9aflox/wt), and wildtype littermate controls (NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9awt/wt). We observed near complete ablation of Na+ currents in knockout {beta}-cells, and intermediate Na+ currents in the heterozygotes. Insulin secretion in response to 15 mM glucose, but not lower concentrations, was significantly reduced from NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9aflox/floxand NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9awt/wt islets from both male and female mice. These effects of carbamazepine on insulin secretion in vitro were not additive to the effects of Scn9a knockout, suggesting that Scn9a is the main target of carbamazepine in {beta}-cells that is relevant for insulin secretion. Complete Scn9a deletion also protected {beta}-cells from death in vitro, similarly and non-additively to carbamazepine treatment. Finally, we assessed diabetes incidence in Nod.Scn9aflox/flox mice and NOD.Ins1Cre;Scn9awt/wt mice injected with AAV8-Ins1Cre virus and a found significant reduction in diabetes incidence in {beta}-cell specific knockout mice compared with littermate controls. Collectively, our data show the Scn9a plays important roles in {beta}-cell function, but also contributes to {beta}-cell death and type 1 diabetes progression. Scn9a is a novel drug target to preserve {beta}-cells in type 1 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "During peptidoglycan recycling (PR) bacteria can recover extracellular fragments of peptidoglycan (PGN) liberated by peptidoglycan turnover (PT) during cell growth and division, and reuse them in cell wall biosynthesis or central carbon metabolism. In Gram-negative bacteria, PR has been well studied, and functions in the induction of resistance to certain classes of antibiotics, and in host-pathogen interaction. However, while Gram-negative cell envelope architecture allows for highly efficient PR, Gram-positive bacteria, which lack an outer cell membrane and are instead enclosed by a glycopolymer layer, can shed large quantities of PGN-derived material to the external environment during growth. Nonetheless, the occurrence of PR was recently demonstrated in several Gram-positive bacteria, including the Gram-positive bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, and its potential adaptive functions are largely unexplored. Given the known roles of PR in Gram-negative bacteria, and that Gram-positive bacteria include several important human pathogens, we asked what role PR may play during Gram-positive pathogen-host interaction. Usingthe model insect host Drosophila melanogaster, we demonstrate that S. aureus mutants impaired in extracellular PGN hydrolysis ({Delta}atl) and PGN fragment uptake ({Delta}murP) show differential virulence compared to their wild-type counterpart. This was linked to increased activation of the D. melanogaster Toll-cascade by spent supernatant from the {Delta}atl mutant. Thus, we propose that S. aureus, and potentially other Gram-positive bacteria, may use extracellular PGN degradation during PT to simultaneously process PGN fragments for recycling and for immune evasion, while recovery and/or metabolism of peptidoglycan fragments during PR may play more subtle roles in determining virulence.\n\nAuthor summaryPGN is a key component of the bacterial cell wall, forming a stress-bearing sacculus surrounding the cell and providing cell shape. During growth and division, the sacculus is dynamically degraded and remodelled to ensure daughter cell separation, resulting in PT. PGN fragments released during PT can be recovered and reutilised by the cell during PR. In Gram-negative pathogens, PR is linked to antibiotic resistance, virulence and modulation of host immune recognition. In Gram-positive bacteria, PR was only recently observed. Here, we explore the roles of PT and PR in host-pathogen interaction in S. aureus, a Gram-positive pathogen of significant clinical relevance. Disruption of PT in S. aureus affected host-pathogen interaction through altering host recognition of shed PGN fragments and PR through modulation of PGN fragment recovery. This improves our understanding of the biology of this important pathogen and may aid development of novel therapeutic approaches to treat S. aureus infections.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial peptides commonly act by disrupting bacterial membranes, but also frequently damage mammalian membranes. Deciphering the rules governing membrane selectivity is critical to understanding their function and enabling their therapeutic use. Past attempts to decipher these rules have failed because they cannot interrogate adequate peptide sequence variation. To overcome this problem, we develop deep mutational surface localized antimicrobial display (dmSLAY), which reveals comprehensive positional residue importance and flexibility across an antimicrobial peptide sequence. We apply dmSLAY to Protegrin-1, a potent yet toxic antimicrobial peptide, and identify thousands of sequence variants that positively or negatively influence its antibacterial activity. Further analysis reveals that avoiding large aromatic residues and eliminating disulfide bound cysteine pairs while maintaining membrane bound secondary structure greatly improves Protegrin-1 bacterial specificity. Moreover, dmSLAY datasets enable machine learning to expand our analysis to include over 5.7 million sequence variants and reveal full Protegrin-1 mutational profiles driving either bacterial or mammalian membrane specificity. Our results describe an innovative, high-throughput approach for elucidating antimicrobial peptide sequence-structure-function relationships which can inform synthetic peptide-based drug design.",

    "abstract": "E3 ubiquitin ligase (E3) plays a vital role in regulating inflammatory responses by mediating ubiquitination. Previous studies have shown that ankyrin repeat and SOCS box-containing protein 3 (ASB3) is involved in immunomodulatory functions associated with cancer. However, the impact of ASB3 on the dynamic interplay of microbiota and inflammatory responses in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is unclear. Here we systematically identify the E3 ligase ASB3 as a facilitative regulator in the development and progression of IBD. ASB3-/- mice are resistant to DSS-induced colitis. I{kappa}B phosphorylation levels and production of proinflammatory factors IL-1{beta}, IL-6, and TNF- were reduced in colonic tissues of ASB3-/- mice compared to WT mice. This colitis-resistant phenotype was suppressed after coprophagic microbial transfer and reversed after combined antibiotic clearance of the microbiota. Mechanistically, ASB3 specifically catalyzes K48-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF6 in IECs. In contrast, in ASB3-deficient organoids, the integrity of the TRAF6 protein is shielded, consequently decelerating the onset of intestinal inflammation. Taken together, Our findings demonstrates that ASB3 is associated with dysregulation of the colitis microbiota and promotes proinflammatory factors production by disrupting the TRAF6 stability. Strategies to limit the protein level of ASB3 in intestinal epithelial cells may help in the treatment of colitis.",

Not only the transport force and velocity of single motor protein, but also the number of kinesin molecules involved in transporting a specific cargo, is pivotal for synapse formation. This collective transport by multiple kinesins ensures stable and efficient cargo transport in neurons. Abnormal increases or decreases in the number of engaged kinesin molecules per cargo could potentially act as biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers, Parkinsons, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spastic paraplegia, polydactyly syndrome, and virus transport disorders.

    "abstract": "Both male and female ticks have a strong innate drive to find and blood-feed on hosts. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is considered a critical behavioral activator and attractant for ticks and an essential sensory cue to find hosts. Yet, how CO2 activates and promotes host-seeking in ticks is poorly understood. We studied CO2 responses in the black-legged tick Ixodes scapularis, the primary vector for Lyme disease in North America. Adult males and females were exposed to 1, 2, 4, or 8% CO2, and changes in walking behavior and foreleg movement were analyzed. We find that CO2 is a potent stimulant for adult Ixodes scapularis, even at lower concentrations (1%). Behavioral reactions depend on the animals state: Walking ticks increase their walking speed, while stationary ticks start to wave their forelegs and begin to quest - both behaviors resembling aspects of host-seeking. Furthermore, Ixodes scapularis has no clear concentration preference and is not tuned more robust to breath-like CO2 concentrations ([~]4%) than to the other concentrations tested. As soon as the CO2 level is above a certain threshold, Ixodes scapularis react, indicating that CO2 acts as a behavioral activator and can be used as a long-distance cue to detect approaching hosts. Moreover, we provide convincing evidence that the foreleg Hallers organ is not necessary for CO2 detection. Even with disabled or amputated Hallers organ, Ixodes scapularis respond robustly to CO2, signifying that there must be CO2-sensitive structures important for tick host-seeking that have not yet been identified.",

    "abstract": "Microtubules, intermediate filaments, and actin are cytoskeletal polymer networks found within the cell. While each has unique functions, all the cytoskeletal elements must work together for cellular mechanics to be fully operative. This is achieved through crosstalk mechanisms whereby the different networks influence each other through signaling pathways and direct interactions. Because crosstalk can be complex, it is possible for perturbations in one cytoskeletal element to affect the others in ways that are difficult to predict. Here we investigated how long-term changes to the actin cytoskeleton affect microtubules and intermediate filaments. Reducing F-actin or actomyosin contractility increased acetylated microtubules and intermediate filament expression, with the effect being significantly more pronounced in neuronal processes. Changes to microtubules were completely reversible if F-actin and myosin activity is restored. Moreover, the altered microtubules in neuronal processes resulting from F-actin depletion caused significant changes to microtubule-based transport, mimicking phenotypes that are linked to neurodegenerative disease. Thus, defects in actin dynamics cause a compensatory response in other cytoskeleton components which profoundly alters cellular function.",

    "abstract": "Riboflavin (vitamin B2) is the precursor of the flavin coenzymes, FAD and FMN, which play a central role in cellular redox metabolism. While humans must obtain riboflavin from dietary sources, certain microbes, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), can biosynthesize riboflavin de novo. Riboflavin precursors have also been implicated in the activation of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells which recognize metabolites derived from the riboflavin biosynthesis pathway complexed to the MHC-I-like molecule, MR1. To investigate the biosynthesis and function of riboflavin and its pathway intermediates in mycobacterial metabolism, physiology and MAIT cell recognition, we constructed conditional knockdowns (hypomorphs) in riboflavin biosynthesis and utilization genes in Mycobacterium smegmatis (Msm) and Mtb by inducible CRISPR interference. Using this comprehensive panel of hypomorphs, we analyzed the impact of gene silencing on viability, on the transcription of (other) riboflavin pathway genes, on the levels of the pathway proteins and on riboflavin itself. Our results revealed that (i) despite lacking a canonical transporter, both Msm and Mtb assimilate exogenous riboflavin when supplied at high concentration; (ii) there is functional redundancy in lumazine synthase activity in Msm; (iii) silencing of ribA2 or ribF is profoundly bactericidal in Mtb; and (iv) in Msm, ribA2 silencing results in concomitant knockdown of other pathway genes coupled with RibA2 and riboflavin depletion and is also bactericidal. In addition to their use in genetic validation of potential drug targets for tuberculosis, this collection of hypomorphs provides a useful resource for investigating the role of pathway intermediates in MAIT cell recognition of mycobacteria.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe pathway for biosynthesis and utilization of riboflavin, precursor of the essential coenzymes, FMN and FAD, is of particular interest in the flavin-rich pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), for two important reasons: (i) the pathway includes potential tuberculosis (TB) drug targets; and (ii) intermediates from the riboflavin biosynthesis pathway provide ligands for mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, which have been implicated in TB pathogenesis. However, the riboflavin pathway is poorly understood in mycobacteria, which lack canonical mechanisms to transport this vitamin and to regulate flavin coenzyme homeostasis. By conditionally disrupting each step of the pathway and assessing the impact on mycobacterial viability and on the levels of the pathway proteins as well as riboflavin, our work provides genetic validation of the riboflavin pathway as a target for TB drug discovery and offers a resource for further exploring the association between riboflavin biosynthesis, MAIT cell activation and TB infection and disease.",

GROMACS, a widely used software suite for molecular dynamics simulations, currently supports only the PDB format. In this study, we modified the source code of GROMACS, which enables it to support the CIF format structure files as input and subsequently generate molecular topology files.

Overall, Toxicology Reports published 715 papers containing relevant images, and 115 of these papers contained inappropriate duplications (16%). Screening papers with the use of ImageTwin.ai increased the number of inappropriate duplications detected, with 41 of the 115 being missed during the manual screen and subsequently detected with the aid of the software. In summary, the rate of inappropriate image duplication in this journal has been quantified at 16%, most of these errors could have been detected at peer review by careful reading of the paper and related literature.

To establish synthetic biology tools for studying these communities in hard-to-image environmental materials, we evaluated whether a single member of a model soil consortium (MSC) can be programmed to report on gene expression without requiring matrix disruption. For these studies, we targeted a five member MSC that includes Dyadobacter fermentans, Ensifer adhaerens, Rhodococcus sp003130705, Streptomyces sp001905665, and Variovorax beijingensis. By coupling the expression of a methyl halide transferase to a constitutive promoter, we show that Variovorax beijingensis can be programmed to synthesize methyl halides that accumulate in the soil headspace at levels that are [&ge;]24-fold higher than all other MSC members across a range of environmentally-relevant hydration conditions. We find that methyl halide production can report on a MSC promoter that is activated by changes in water potential, and we demonstrate that a synthetic gas signal can be read out directly using gas chromatography and indirectly using a soil-derived Methylorubrum that is programmed to produce a visual output in response to methyl halides. These tools will be useful for future studies that investigate how MSC respond to dynamic hydration conditions, such as drought and flood events induced by climate change, which can alter soil water potential and induce the release of stored carbon.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies of angiosperm diversification have focused on the role of polyploidy as a driver of diversification. However, we know far less about the effects of single changes in chromosome number--dysploidy, which can mediate lineage diversification by affecting recombination rates, linkage, and/or reproductive isolation. Modeling the effects of dysploidy on diversification is mathematically and computationally challenging because many states and parameters are required to track changes in individual chromosomes, especially in lineages that have high variability in chromosome number. Additionally, we expect the processes of diversification and dysploidy to vary across clades, which requires modeling process variation to disentangle the effects of the observed trait (chromosome number) from the effects of unobserved traits on diversification. In this work, we propose a new state-dependent diversification model of chromosome evolution that includes numerous character states and explicitly models heterogeneity in the diversification process. Our model includes parameters that functionally link diversification rates to dysploidy rates and differentiate between anagenetic and cladogenetic changes. We apply this model to Carex (Cyperaceae), a model lineage for understanding dysploidy and diversification, leveraging chromosome number information and the most recent time-calibrated phylogenetic tree for over 700 species and subspecies. We recover distinct modes of chromosomal speciation across Carex. In one mode, dysploidy occurs very frequently and drives faster diversification rates. In the other mode, dysploidy is rare and diversification is driven by other factors, unmeasured in our analysis. This study is the first to demonstrate that dysploidy drives diversification in plants while considering unmeasured factors affecting diversification.\n\nSignificance StatementEvolutionary genomic rearrangements via the gain and/or loss of chromosomes without losing DNA may cause new species to form, but how this process plays out over a millions-of-years timescale is unclear. We test if there is a detectable effect of chromosome gains/losses on the rate of species formation in a large, diverse group of plants. We demonstrate decisively for the first time that these rearrangements sometimes drive the formation of new species through two evolutionary modes. In one mode, rearrangements happen rapidly and sometimes cause new species to form. In the other mode, rearrangements happen less frequently and are not associated with new species formation; instead, other factors--unmeasured in our analysis--likely drive the formation of new species.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is considered a primarily microvascular complication of diabetes. Muller glia cells are at the center of the retinal neurovascular unit and play a critical role in DR. We therefore investigated Muller cell-specific signaling pathways that are altered in DR to identify novel targets for gene therapy. Using a multi-omics approach on purified Muller cells from diabetic db/db mice, we found the mRNA and protein expression of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to be significantly decreased, while its target gene cluster was down-regulated. Further, oPOSSUM TF analysis and ATAC-sequencing identified the GR as a master regulator of Muller cell gliosis in DR. Cortisol not only increased GR phosphorylation. It also induced changes in the expression of known GR target genes in retinal explants. Finally, retinal functionality was improved by AAV-mediated overexpression of GR in Muller cells. Our study demonstrates an important role of the glial GR in DR and implies that therapeutic approaches targeting this signalling pathway should be aimed at increasing GR expression rather than the addition of more ligand.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=76 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/556478v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (44K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c7869forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1574edforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fb1329org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a6ee60_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Benzo[a]pyrene, a notorious DNA-damaging carcinogen, belongs to the family of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons commonly found in tobacco smoke. Surprisingly, nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery exhibits inefficiency in recognising specific bulky DNA adducts including Benzo[a]pyrene Diol-Epoxide (BPDE), a Benzo[a]pyrene metabolite. While sequence context is emerging as the leading factor linking the inadequate NER response to BPDE adducts, the precise structural attributes governing these disparities remain inadequately understood. We therefore combined the domains of molecular dynamics and machine learning to conduct a comprehensive assessment of helical distortion caused by BPDE-Guanine adducts in multiple gene contexts. Specifically, we implemented a dual approach involving a random forest classification-based analysis and subsequent feature selection to identify precise topological features that may distinguish adduct sites of variable repair capacity. Our models were trained using helical data extracted from duplexes representing both BPDE hotspot and non-hotspot sites within the TP53 gene, then applied to sites within TP53, cII, and lacZ genes.\n\nWe show our optimised model consistently achieved exceptional performance, with accuracy, precision, and f1 scores exceeding 91%. Our feature selection approach uncovered that discernible variance in regional base pair rotation played a pivotal role in informing the decisions of our model. Notably, these disparities were highly conserved among TP53 and lacZ duplexes and appeared to be influenced by the regional GC content. As such, our findings suggest that there are indeed conserved topological features distinguishing hotspots and non-hotpot sites, highlighting regional GC content as a potential biomarker for mutation.\n\nAuthor SummaryAlthough much is known about DNA repair processes, we are still lacking some fundamental understanding relating to DNA sequence and mutation rates, specifically why some sequences mutate at a higher rate or are repaired less than others. We believe that by using a combination of Molecular Simulation and Machine Learning (ML) we can measure which structural features are present in sequences which mutate at higher rates in cancer gene and lab-based test assays frequently used to investigate toxicology.\n\nHere we have run Molecular Dynamics on five sets of DNA sequences with and without a carcinogen found in cigarette smoke to allow us to study the mutation event that would need to be repaired. We have measured their helical and base stacking properties. We have used ML to successfully differentiate between low and high mutating sequences using this model allowing us to begin to elucidate the structural features these groups have in common.\n\nWe believe this method could have wide reaching uses, it could be applied to any gene context and mutation event and indeed the knowledge of the structural features which are best repaired gives us insight into the biophysics of DNA repair adding knowledge to the drug design pipeline.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWWhen humans perform repetitive tasks over long periods, their performance is not constant. People may drift in and out of states that might be loosely categorised as engagement, disengagement or  flow and these will be reflected in multiple aspects of their performance (for example, reaction time, accuracy, criteria shifts and potentially longer-term strategy) but until recently it has been challenging to relate these behavioural states to the underlying neural mechanisms that generate them. Here, we took Magnetoencephalograpy recordings of participants performing an engaging task that required rapid, strategic behavioural responses. In this way we acquired both high density neural data and contemporaneous, dense behavioural data. Specifically, participants played a laboratory version of Tetris which collects detailed recordings of player input and game-state throughout performance. We asked whether it was possible to infer the presence of distinct behavioural states from the behavioural data and, if so, whether these states would have distinct neural correlates. We used hidden Markov modelling to segment the behavioural time series into states with unique behavioural signatures, finding that we could identify three distinct and robust behavioural states. We then computed occipital alpha power across each state. These within-participant differences in alpha power were statistically significant, suggesting that individuals shift between behaviourally and neurally distinct states during complex performance, and that visuo-spatial attention change across these states.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial cell division is crucial for replication and requires careful coordination via a complex set of proteins collectively known as the divisome. The tubulin-like GTPase FtsZ is the master regulator of this process and serves to recruit downstream divisome proteins and regulate their activities. Upon arrival at mid-cell, FtsZ associates with the membrane via anchoring proteins and exhibits treadmilling motion, driven by its GTP binding and hydrolysis activities. Treadmilling is proposed to play a role in Z-ring condensation, as well as in distribution and regulation of peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall remodeling enzymes. FtsZ polymer superstructure and dynamics are central to its function, yet their regulation is incompletely understood. We sought to address these gaps in knowledge by modulating intrinsic and extrinsic regulators of FtsZ and evaluating their effects in vitro and in cells, alone and in combination. To do this, we leveraged the cell cycle control features of Caulobacter crescentus. We observed that Caulobacter FtsZ variants that abrogate GTP hydrolysis impact FtsZ dynamics and Z-ring positioning, with little to no effect on Z-ring structure or constriction. Production of an FtsZ variant lacking its disordered C-terminal linker ({Delta}CTL) resulted in aberrant Z-ring dynamics and morphology, misregulated PG metabolism, and cell lysis. Combining {Delta}CTL and GTPase mutations was additive, suggesting they each act independently to control the Z-ring. Modulating levels of FtsA resulted in formation of multiple Z-rings that failed to constrict, suggesting roles in regulating both FtsZ superstructure and the activity of downstream divisome components. Collectively, our results indicate that GTP hydrolysis serves primarily to position the Z-ring at mid-cell, the CTL regulates both Z-ring structure and downstream signaling, and FtsA contributes to all aspects of FtsZ assembly and function. The additive effects of these elements are required to support robust and efficient cell division.",

    "abstract": "The steroid hormone progesterone (P4) regulates multiple aspects of reproductive and metabolic physiology. Classical P4 signaling operates through nuclear receptors that regulate transcription of target genes. In addition, P4 signals through membrane P4 receptors (mPRs) in a rapid nongenomic modality. Despite the established physiological importance of P4 nongenomic signaling, its detailed signal transduction remains elusive. Here, using Xenopus oocyte maturation as a well-established physiological readout of nongenomic P4 signaling, we identify the lipid hydrolase ABHD2 (/{beta} hydrolase domain-containing protein 2) as an essential mPR{beta} co-receptor to trigger meiosis. We show using functional assays coupled to unbiased and targeted cell-based lipidomics that ABHD2 possesses a phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity that requires both P4 and mPR{beta}. This PLA2 activity bifurcates P4 signaling by inducing mPR{beta} clathrin-dependent endocytosis and producing lipid messengers that are G-protein coupled receptors agonists. Therefore, P4 drives meiosis by inducing the ABHD2 PLA2 activity that requires both mPR{beta} and ABHD2 as obligate co-receptors.\n\nSignificance StatementNongenomic progesterone signaling is important for many physiological functions yet its detailed early signaling steps remain elusive. Here we show that progesterone induces rapid signaling to drive Xenopus oocyte meiosis. Progesterone requires two cell membrane receptor to work in unison to signal. The co-receptor complex possesses lipase activity that produces lipid messenger and changes cell membrane structure. This leads to receptor endocytosis and activation of additional pathway to trigger meiosis. Nongenomic progesterone signaling operates in every tissue and regulates reproductive and metabolic physiology. Therefore, our findings have broad implications on our understanding of nongenomic progesterone signaling.",

In animals, the frequency analysis of the round-window electrical noise recorded by means of electrocochleography yields a frequency peak at around 900 to 1000 Hz, which has been proposed to reflect auditory-nerve spontaneous activity. Here, we studied the spectral components of the electrical noise obtained from cochlear implant electrocochleography in humans.\n\nMethodsWe recruited adult cochlear implant recipients from the Clinical Hospital of the Universidad de Chile, between the years 2021 and 2022. We used the AIM System from Advanced Bionics(R) to obtain single trial electrocochleography signals from the most apical electrode in cochlear implant users. We performed a protocol to study spontaneous activity and auditory responses to 0.5 and 2 kHz tones\n\nResultsTwenty subjects including 12 females, with a mean age of 57.9 {+/-} 12.6 years (range between 36 and 78 years) were recruited. The electrical noise of the single trial cochlear implant electrocochleography signal yielded a reliable peak at 3.1 kHz in 55% of the cases (11 out of 20 subjects), while an oscillatory pattern that masked the spectrum was observed in seven cases. In the other two cases, the single-trial noise was not classifiable. Auditory stimulation at 0.5 kHz and 2.0 kHz did not change the amplitude of the 3.1 kHz frequency peak.\n\nConclusionWe found two main types of noise patterns in the frequency analysis of the single-trial noise from cochlear implant electrocochleography, including a peak at 3.1 kHz that might reflect auditory-nerve spontaneous activity, while the oscillatory pattern probably corresponds to an artifact.",

    "abstract": "The amyloid precursor protein (APP), whose proteolytic cleavage gives rise to amyloid-{beta} peptide, has been extensively studied for its role in Alzheimers disease, but its physiological function remains less understood. In neurons, APP and its two homologs, the amyloid precursor-like protein 1 (APLP1) and 2 (APLP2), are present in the synaptic compartment and promote synaptogenesis. Over recent years, astrocytes, an abundant glial cell in the brain, have attracted much attention for their role in regulating synapse formation and function. Although APP is also found in astrocytes, its role in these cells remains largely unexplored. Here we have sought to investigate the expression and function of APP in rodent astrocytes in vitro and in vivo. We find that APP along with its family members, APLP1 and APLP2, are expressed in astrocytes in vitro and in vivo. In primary hippocampal cultures, shRNA-mediated knockdown of astrocytic APP, APLP1 or APLP2 compromises astrocyte morphological elaboration to varying degrees. We have then focused on APP to characterize its role in astrocyte development in the intact brain. We show that astrocytic APP shapes the morphological complexity of astrocyte processes in vivo and may also modulate postsynaptic assembly. Our results highlight a role of astrocytic APP and possibly of APLPs that could potentially impact neuronal functions.",

    "abstract": "Limb movement direction can be inferred from motor cortex activity. In humans, such decoding has been predominantly demonstrated using the spectral power of electrophysiological signals recorded in sensorimotor areas during movement execution. Yet, it remains unclear to what extent intended hand movement direction can be predicted from brain signals recorded during movement planning. Furthermore, whether other oscillatory features beyond power are also involved in direction encoding is not fully understood. Here, we set out to probe the directional-tuning of oscillatory phase, amplitude and Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC) during motor planning and execution, using a machine learning framework on multi-site local field potentials (LFPs) in humans. To this end, we recorded intracranial EEG data from implanted epilepsy patients as they performed a four-direction delayed center-out motor task. We found that LFP power significantly predicted hand-movement direction at execution but also during planning. While successful classification during planning primarily involved low-frequency power in a fronto-parietal circuit, decoding during execution was largely mediated by higher frequency activity in motor and premotor areas. Interestingly, LFP phase at very low frequencies (<1.5 Hz) led to significant decoding in premotor brain regions during execution. The machine learning framework also showed PAC to be uniformly modulated across directions through the task. Cross-temporal generalization analyses revealed that several stable brain patterns in prefrontal and premotor brain regions encode directions across both planning and execution. Finally, multivariate classification led to an increase in overall decoding accuracy (>80%) during both planning and execution. The novel insights revealed here extend our understanding of the role of neural oscillations in encoding motor plans.",

However, the mechanisms underlying the initiation of the TLR7/8-mediated autoimmune signaling remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that miR-574-5p is aberrantly upregulated in tissues of lupus prone mice and in the plasma of lupus patients, with its expression levels correlating with the disease activity. miR-574-5p binds to and activates human hTLR8 or its murine ortholog mTlr7 to elicit a series of MyD88-dependent immune and inflammatory responses. These responses include the overproduction of cytokines and interferons, the activation of STAT1 signaling and B lymphocytes, and the production of autoantigens. In a transgenic mouse model, the induction of miR-574-5p overexpression is associated with increased secretion of antinuclear and anti-dsDNA antibodies, increased IgG and C3 deposit in the kidney, elevated expression of inflammatory genes in the spleen. In lupus-prone mice, lentivirus-mediated silencing of miR-574-5p significantly ameliorates major symptoms associated with lupus and lupus nephritis. Collectively, these results suggest that the miR-574-5p-hTLR8/mTlr7 signaling is an important axis of immune and inflammatory responses, contributing significantly to the development of lupus and lupus nephritis.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are key energy transforming organelles in mammalian cells. However, how defects in oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) and other mitochondrial functions influence whole-body energy expenditure (EE) has not been rigorously studied. Cellular and organismal responses to OxPhos defects likely involve a combination of functional downregulation to conserve energy and compensatory upregulation of stress responses. If the energy cost of compensatory responses exceeds the potential energy savings of functional downregulation, as recent work suggests, the result would be an increase in total EE. To address the hypothesis that OxPhos defects increase the energetic cost of living, we performed a meta-analysis of available studies reporting EE in animal models with mitochondrial gene defects. Of all reported experimental conditions (n = 91, from 29 studies), 51% reported a >10% elevation in EE relative to control animals, compared to 11% reporting <10% reduction in EE (p<0.0001, Chi-square). Of the experimental conditions where locomotor activity was also quantified, 39% showed that OxPhos-deficient animals had elevated EE despite reduced locomotor activity, which would be expected to decrease EE. To extend this finding in humans, we re-analyzed a high-quality clinical and multi-omics dataset (Sharma et al. 2021) of mitochondrial disease patients with the m.3243A>G mutation. This analysis similarly indicates an upregulation of energetically costly physiological, immune, and metabolic parameters in people with OxPhos deficiency. These results suggest that animals and humans with mitochondrial defects must expend more energy to sustain life, a state clinically called hypermetabolism. High-quality human energetics studies are needed to understand the magnitude, mechanisms, and modifiability of hypermetabolism in mitochondrial disorders.",

    "abstract": "Pathologic alterations in the biomechanical properties of the Schlemms canal (SC) inner wall endothelium and its immediate vicinity are strongly associated with ocular hypertension in glaucoma due to decreased outflow facility. Specifically, the underlying trabecular meshwork is substantially stiffer in glaucomatous eyes compared to that from normal eyes. This raises the possibility of a critical involvement of mechanotransduction processes in driving SC cell dysfunction. Yes-associated protein (YAP) has emerged as a key contributor to glaucoma pathogenesis. However, the molecular underpinnings of SC cell YAP mechanosignaling in response to glaucomatous extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffening are not well understood. Using a novel biopolymer hydrogel that facilitates dynamic and reversible stiffness tuning, we investigated how ECM stiffening modulates YAP activity in primary human SC cells, and whether disruption of YAP mechanosignaling attenuates SC cell pathobiology and increases ex vivo outflow facility. We demonstrated that ECM stiffening drives pathologic YAP activation and cytoskeletal reorganization in SC cells, which was fully reversible by matrix softening in a distinct time-dependent manner. Furthermore, we showed that pharmacologic or genetic disruption of YAP mechanosignaling abrogates stiffness-induced SC cell dysfunction involving altered cytoskeletal and ECM remodeling. Lastly, we found that perfusion of the clinically-used, small molecule YAP inhibitor verteporfin (without light activation) increases ex vivo outflow facility in normal mouse eyes. Collectively, our data provide new evidence for a pathologic role of aberrant YAP mechanosignaling in SC cell dysfunction and suggest that YAP inhibition has therapeutic value for treating ocular hypertension in glaucoma.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRainfall-induced coastal runoff represents an important environmental impact in near-shore coral reefs that may affect coral-associated bacterial microbiomes. Shifts in microbiome community composition and function can stress corals and ultimately cause mortality and reef declines. Impacts of environmental stress may be site specific and differ between coral microbiome compartments (e.g., tissue versus mucus). Coastal runoff and associated water pollution represent a major stressor for near-shore reef-ecosystems in Guam, Micronesia.\n\nMethodsAcropora pulchra colonies growing on the West Hag[a]tna reef flat in Guam were sampled over a period of eight months spanning the 2021 wet and dry seasons. To examine bacterial microbiome diversity and composition, samples of A. pulchra tissue and mucus were collected during late April, early July, late September, and at the end of December. Samples were collected from populations in two different habitat zones, near the reef crest (farshore) and close to shore (nearshore). Seawater samples were collected during the same time period to evaluate microbiome dynamics of the waters surrounding coral colonies. Tissue, mucus, and seawater microbiomes were determined using 16S DNA metabarcoding using Illumina sequencing. In addition, water samples were collected to determine fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) concentrations, as an indicator of water pollution. Water temperatures were recorded using data loggers and precipitation data obtained from a nearby rain gauge. The correlation structure of environmental parameters (temperature and rainfall), FIB concentrations, and A. pulchra microbiome diversity was evaluated using a struictural equation model. Beta diversity analyses were used to investigate spatio-temporal trends of microbiome composition.\n\nResultsA. pulchra microbiome diversity differed between tissues and mucus, with mucus microbiome diversity being similar to the surrounding seawater. Rainfall and associated fluctuations of FIB concentrations were correlated with changes in tissue and mucus microbiomes, indicating their role as drivers of A. pulchra microbiome diversity. A. pulchra tiussue microbiome composition remained relatively stable throughout dry and wet seasons and were dominated by Endozoicomonadaceae, coral endosymbionts and putative indicators of coral health. In nearshore A. pulchra tissue microbiomes, Simkaniaceae, putative obligate coral endosymbionts, were more abundant than in A. pulchra colonies growing near the reef crest (farshore). A. pulchra mucus microbiomes were more diverse during the wet season than the dry season, a distinction that was also associated with drastic shifts in microbiome composition. This study highlights the seasonal dynamics of coral microbiomes and demonstrates that microbiome diversity and composition may differ between coral tissues and the surface mucus layer.",

    "abstract": "The {micro}-opioid receptor ({micro}OR) is a well-established target for analgesia, yet conventional opioid receptor agonists cause serious adverse effects, notably addiction and respiratory depression, which have led to the present opioid overdose epidemic. {micro}OR negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) may serve as powerful tools in preventing opioid overdose deaths, but promising chemical scaffolds remain elusive. We screened a large DNA-encoded chemical library against inactive {micro}OR, counter-screening with active, G-protein and agonist bound receptor to \"steer\" selections toward functional negative allosteric modulators. We discovered a NAM compound with high and selective enrichment to inactive {micro}OR; the molecule potently blocks the activity of orthosteric agonists and enhances the affinity of the key opioid overdose reversal molecule, naloxone. It accomplishes this by binding to a site on the extracellular vestibule proximal to naloxone, stabilizing a unique inactive conformation of the extracellular portions of the second and seventh transmembrane helices. The NAM perturbs orthosteric ligand kinetics in therapeutically desirable ways and works cooperatively with low doses of naloxone in vivo to inhibit morphine-induced antinociception, respiratory depression and conditioned place preference while minimizing withdrawal behaviors. Our results provide detailed structural insights into the mechanism of a negative allosteric modulator for the {micro}OR and demonstrate how it can be exploited in vivo.",

We use LVING to quantify the growth in different regions of the cell during phases of the cell cycle. LVING can also be used to quantitatively compare the effect of range of chemotherapy drug doses on subcellular growth processes. Finally, we applied LVING to characterize the effect of autophagy on the growth machinery inside cells.

Cockayne syndrome B protein (CSB), or its yeast ortholog Rad26, has been known for decades to play important roles in the lesion-recognition steps of TC-NER. Another conserved protein ELOF1, or its yeast ortholog Elf1, was recently identified as a core transcription-coupled repair factor. How Rad26 distinguishes between RNA polymerase II (Pol II) stalled at a DNA lesion or other obstacles and what role Elf1 plays in this process remains unknown. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of Pol II-Rad26 complexes stalled at different obstacles that show that Rad26 uses a universal mechanism to recognize a stalled Pol II but interacts more strongly with a lesion-arrested Pol II. A cryo-EM structure of lesion-arrested Pol II-Rad26 bound to Elf1 revealed that Elf1 induces new interactions between Rad26 and Pol II when the complex is stalled at a lesion. Biochemical and genetic data support the importance of the interplay between Elf1 and Rad26 in TC-NER initiation.",

Identifying the most appropriate thermal performance model for a specific trait type has broad applications, from metabolic modelling at the cellular level to forecasting the effects of climate change on population, ecosystem, and disease transmission dynamics. To date, numerous mathematical models have been designed, but a thorough comparison among them is lacking. In particular, we do not know if certain models consistently outperform others, and how factors such as sampling resolution and trait or organismal identity influence model performance. These have led researchers to select models semi-arbitrarily, potentially introducing biases that compromise environmental suitability predictions. To fill these gaps, we collect 2,739 thermal performance datasets from diverse traits and taxa, to which we fit 83 models used in previous studies. We detect remarkable variation in model performance which is not primarily driven by sampling resolution, trait type, or taxonomic information. Our results highlight a lack of well-defined scenarios in which certain models are more appropriate than others. Therefore, to avoid likely model-specific biases, future studies should perform model selection to identify the most appropriate model(s) for their data.",

We found that haplotypes diverge independently since the transition to asexuality at least 20 my ago. Multiple lines of evidence indicate disparate evolutionary trajectories between haplotypic blocks.

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic energy production requires tight coordination between gene products from both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Because males and females often have different energetic strategies, this mitonuclear coordination can be expected to differentially impact the two sexes. Previous work found evidence for sex-specific mitonuclear effects in the copepod Tigriopus californicus by comparing two parental lines and their reciprocal F1 crosses. However, an alternative hypothesis is that the patterns could instead be driven by the parental source of nuclear alleles. Here we test this alternative hypothesis by extending the same cross to F2 hybrids, who receive both maternal and paternal nuclear alleles from F1 hybrids. Results confirm mitonuclear effects on sex ratio, with distorted ratios persisting from the F1 to F2 generations, despite reduced fitness in F2 hybrids. No sex by cross interactions were found for other phenotypic traits measured. Mitochondrial DNA content was shown to be higher in females, the more stress-tolerant sex. Both routine metabolic rate and oxidative DNA damage were found to be lower in F2 hybrids than in parentals. Confirmation of sex-biased mitonuclear effects in T. californicus is notable, given that the species lacks sex chromosomes, which can confound interpretations of sex-specific mitochondrial effects.",

To overcome this, we developed KaryoTap, a method combining custom targeted panels for the Tapestri scDNA-seq platform with a Gaussian mixture model analysis framework to enable detection of chromosome- and chromosome arm-scale aneuploidy in all human chromosomes across thousands of single cells simultaneously.

It was found that the binding interfaces in distinctive protein complexes are highly similar. The structural properties underlying different binding interfaces could be further captured by artificial intelligence. In order to test this hypothesis, we broke protein-protein binding interfaces into pairs of interacting fragments. We employed a generative model to encode these interface fragment pairs in a low-dimensional latent space. After training, new conformations of interface fragment pairs were generated. We found that, by only using a small number of interface fragment pairs that were generated by artificial intelligence, we were able to guide the assembly of protein complexes into their native conformations. These results demonstrate that the conformational space of fragment pairs at protein-protein binding interfaces is highly degenerate. Our study illustrates how artificial intelligence can be used to understand and characterize protein-protein binding interfaces. The method will be potentially useful to search for the conformation of unknown protein-protein interactions. This result demonstrated that the structural space of protein-protein interactions is highly degenerate under the representation of interface fragment pairs. Features in this degenerate space can be well characterized by artificial intelligence. In summary, our machine learning method will be potentially useful to search for and predict the conformations of unknown protein-protein interactions.",

    "abstract": "Targeted therapies have become pivotal in modern clinical oncology, driven by a molecularlevel understanding of cancers intricacies, its progression, and innovative research and technology. Personalized and targeted treatments hinge on identifying key genes, hub genes, or biomarkers. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks are instrumental in understanding the molecular basis of diseases. While existing literature has identified significant genes based on network centrality, investigations based on community-aware centrality have been notably absent. This omission matters because disease networks frequently display modular structures, necessitating a new perspective. This study bridges the gap between network centrality and community-based investigations. Indeed, in modular networks, node influence can be categorized into two types: local impact within its community, determined by intra-community connections, and global effect on nodes in other communities, established through inter-community links. This concept extends conventional centrality measures to networks with a community structure. Initially, we performed a comparative analysis of seven PPI networks related to cancer and noncancerous conditions. We explore the correlation between classical network centralities and their equivalents at the global (inter-community) and local (intra-community) levels. Notably, we consistently observed a high correlation between network degree and local degree centrality in all PPIs, leading us to select local degree centrality for further investigation. Pronounced modularity characterizes prostate and cervical disease networks. Consequently, we investigate these networks to identify key genes at the local community level and validate them by examining their expression levels. Variations in gene expression between cancerous and non-cancerous tissues bolster our findings. We identify a novel set of genes as potential key players in prostate and cervical cancer. Specifically, in cervical cancer, the top genes at the mesoscopic level include AKT1, CDK2, BRCA1, VEGFA, SRC, PSMD14, MRPL3, TP53, and NUP37. Meanwhile, the top genes identified in prostate cancer are FOS, TP53, UBA52, HLA-B, TSPO, and CD19. Although we focus on cancer data, our methodologys versatility makes it applicable to other disease networks, opening avenues to identify key genes as potential drug targets.",

    "abstract": "Elevated oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) is a risk factor and component that worsens cardiovascular disease states. OxLDL can elicit its detrimental action, via lectin-like oxLDL receptor 1 (LOX-1) and has been shown to disrupt vascular function. In this study, we determined whether oxLDL, via LOX-1, alters aortic vascular reactivity and determined if sex differences exist. Thoracic aortic endothelium-intact or -denuded ring segments were isolated from intact C57BL/6J female and male mice and incubated with oxLDL ex vivo (50ug/dL; 2h). Using wire myography, cumulative concentration-response curves to phenylephrine (PE) were generated to determine contractile responses. From these curves, the EC50 was determined and used to contract rings to assess acetylcholine (ACh) dependent relaxation. Calculated aortic stiffness and remodeling, as well as mRNA expression of vasoactive and pro-inflammatory mediators were assessed. BI-0115 (10M; selective LOX-1 inhibitor) was used to determine LOX-1 dependence. We observed differential sex, age, endothelial cell, and LOX-1 dependent alterations to the efficacy of PE-induced contractile responses and ACh-mediated vasorelaxation in the thoracic aortic rings following oxLDL exposure. Additionally, we observed a distinct sex and age effect on thoracic aortic stiffness following exposure to oxLDL. There was also a sex effect on calculated vessel diameter, as well as an age effect on oxLDL-mediated inward remodeling that was LOX-1 dependent. Thus, LOX-1 inhibition and the resulting attenuation of oxLDL/endothelial-mediated alterations in aortic function suggests that there are differential sex differences in the role of oxLDL/LOX-1 in the thoracic aorta of male and female mice.\n\nNEW & NOTEWORTHYWe investigated the effects of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) via the LOX-1 receptor on murine thoracic aortic vasoreactivity, stiffness, and remodeling across age and sex. Acute exposure to oxLDL led to altered vasoreactivity, endothelial dysfunction, and changes in aortic stiffness and remodeling. These effects were in-part age, sex, endothelial, and LOX-1 dependent. This study reveals potential complex interactions in oxLDL/LOX-1-mediated vascular responses that could serve as potential therapeutic intervention for vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=134 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/556764v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (24K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bffb67org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1122c31org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1352d9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a44880_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Comparative analyses revealed that the large yerba mate genome size is partly due to a whole-genome duplication (Ip-) during the early evolutionary history of Ilex, in addition to the hexaploidization event ({gamma}) shared by core eudicots. Characterization of the genome allowed us to clone the genes encoding methyltransferase enzymes that catalyse multiple reactions required for caffeine production. To our surprise, this species has converged upon a different biochemical pathway compared to that of its relatives, coffee and tea. In order to gain insight into the structural basis for the convergent enzyme activities, we obtained a crystal structure for the terminal enzyme in the pathway that forms caffeine. The structure reveals that convergent solutions have evolved for substrate positioning because different amino acid residues facilitate a different substrate orientation such that efficient methylation occurs in the independently evolved enzymes in yerba mate and coffee. While our results show phylogenomic constraint limits the genes coopted for convergence of caffeine biosynthesis, the x-ray diffraction data suggests structural constraints are minimal for the convergent evolution of individual reactions.",

The effector HopZ5, which is present in all isolates of Psa3 causing global outbreaks of pandemic kiwifruit canker disease, triggers immunity in Nicotiana benthamiana and is not recognised in susceptible A. chinensis cultivars. In a search for N. benthamiana non-host resistance genes against HopZ5, we found that the nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptor NbPTR1 recognised HopZ5. RPM1-interacting protein 4 (RIN4) orthologues from multiple plants, including kiwifruit, were associated with NbPTR1-mediated autoimmunity suppression and recognition of HopZ5. No functional orthologues of NbPTR1 were found in A. chinensis. NbPTR1 transformed into Psa3-susceptible A. chinensis var. chinensis  Hort16A plants introduced HopZ5-specific resistance against Psa3. Altogether, this study suggested that expressing NbPTR1 in Psa3-susceptible kiwifruit is a viable approach to acquiring resistance to Psa3 and it provides valuable information for engineering resistance in otherwise susceptible kiwifruit genotypes.",

    "abstract": "Riboflavin (RF) serves as a precursor to FMN and FAD, crucial cofactors in various metabolic processes. Strict regulation of cellular flavin homeostasis is imperative, yet information regarding the factors governing this regulation remains largely elusive. In this study, we first examined the impact of external flavin treatment on the Arabidopsis transcriptome to identify novel regulators of cellular flavin levels. Our analysis revealed alterations in the expression of 49 putative transcription factors. Subsequent reverse genetic screening highlighted a member of the Dehydration-Responsive Element Binding (DREB) family, AtDREB2G, as a potential regulator of cellular flavin levels. Knockout mutants of AtDREB2G (dreb2g) exhibited reduced flavin levels and decreased expression of RF biosynthetic genes compared to wild-type plants. Conversely, conditional overexpression of AtDREB2G led to an increase in the expression of RF biosynthetic genes and elevated flavin levels. In wild-type plants, exposure to low temperatures and abscisic acid treatment stimulated enhanced flavin levels and upregulated the expression of RF biosynthetic genes, concomitant with the induction of AtDREB2G. Notably, these responses were significantly attenuated in dreb2g mutants. Our findings establish AtDREB2G as a novel positive regulator of flavin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis, particularly under conditions of low temperature and abscisic acid treatment.",

    "abstract": "Animal migrations are disappearing globally, while insect populations are on alarming declines. Both ecosystem degradations, influenced by unpredictable impacts of climate change, are also exacerbated by human activities such as intensified land use and various forms of environmental pollution. Butterfly migrations may serve as sensitive indicator phenomena of these broader environmental changes. While the transcontinental journeys of one of the most famous Lepidopteran species, the North American monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus, are documented in depth, they are a geographically restricted phenomenon. Comprehensive studies from other areas and on other migratory butterflies like the European red admiral, Vanessa atalanta, are notably sparse. In addition, the details of their navigational capacities and how they might be affected by the aforementioned changes remain largely enigmatic. Against this backdrop, we seek to establish the red admiral as a model for insect movement phenology and navigation behaviour which both might be impacted by environmental changes. Employing a combination of orientation tests, utilizing flight-simulators and free-flight trials during late summer, together with a 23-year study on movement phenology at a coastal migration flyway, the Baltic Sea coast, we offer broad insights into red admiral migration. In our experiments, butterflies exhibited a southwestern orientation on the Courish Spit and chose a south-southeastern trajectory in free-flight trials after translocation at the Latvian Baltic Sea coast. Directional records from decades-long trapping data, based on more than 16,000 individuals, match these findings. Nevertheless, we also found reverse movements to occur under some circumstances. At the same time, the observed estimated median dates of red admiral passages did change by one day only between decades, however, generally more butterflies were recorded in recent years. Our data thus suggest a certain degree of adaptability in the butterflies movement behaviour, indicating an innate migration schedule, possibly supported by a flexible navigational capacity. As the world is facing biodiversity loss at a high rate, long-term monitorings of indicator species become important. By establishing the red admirals as a model for butterfly migration, we expect insights into broader movement patterns and navigational strategies in Lepidoptera negotiating human-dominated environments, filling a crucial gap in our current understanding of these interdependent aspects of insect biology.",

    "abstract": "Intercellular miRNA exchange acts as a key mechanism to control gene expression post-transcriptionally in mammalian cells. Regulated export of repressive miRNAs allows the expression of inflammatory cytokines in activated macrophages. Intracellular trafficking of miRNAs from endoplasmic reticulum to endosomes is a rate determining step in miRNA export process and plays an important role in controlling cellular miRNA level and inflammatory processes in macrophages. We have identified the SNARE protein Syntaxin5 to show a synchronized expression pattern with miRNA activity loss in activated mammalian macrophage cells. Syntaxin 5 is both necessary and sufficient for macrophage activation and clearance of the intracellular pathogen Leishmania donovani from infected macrophages. Exploring the mechanism of how Syntaxin5 acts as an immunostimulant, we have identified the de novo RNA binding property of this SNARE protein that binds specific miRNAs and facilitates their accumulation in endosomes in a cooperative manner with human ELAV protein HuR to ensure export of miRNAs and allows the expression of miRNA-repressed cytokines. Conversely, in its dual role in miRNA export, this SNARE protein prevents lysosomal targeting of endosomes by enhancing the fusion of miRNA-loaded endosomes with plasma membrane to ensure accelerated release of extracellular vesicles and associated miRNAs.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=147 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/556844v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (28K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bfabf8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b35346org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@203a5corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d7a15e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG O_LIHuR transfers miRNAs to STX5 for export\nC_LIO_LISTX5 utilizes its N-terminal disordered domain to bind and target miRNAs to endosomes.\nC_LIO_LIIn its dual role, STX5 uses the SNARE domain to export miRNA by promoting EV biogenesis and release.\nC_LIO_LISTX5-mediated miRNA export activates macrophage to clear internalized parasites.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Although genetic manipulation is one of the hallmarks in model organisms, its applicability to non-model species has remained difficult due to our limited understanding of their fundamental biology. For instance, manipulation of a cell line originated from the blacklegged tick Ixodes scapularis, an arthropod that serves as a vector of several human pathogens, has yet to be established. Here, we demonstrate the successful genetic modification of the commonly used tick ISE6 line through ectopic expression and clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) genome editing. We performed ectopic expression using nucleofection and attained CRISPR-Cas9 editing via homology dependent recombination. Targeting the E3 ubiquitin ligase X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (xiap) and its substrate p47 led to alteration in molecular signaling within the immune deficiency (IMD) network and increased infection of the rickettsial agent Anaplasma phagocytophilum in I. scapularis ISE6 cells. Collectively, our findings complement techniques for genetic engineering of ticks in vivo and aid in circumventing the long-life cycle of I. scapularis, of which limits efficient and scalable molecular genetic screens.\n\nImportanceGenetic engineering in arachnids has lagged compared to insects, largely because of substantial differences in their biology. This study unveils the implementation of ectopic expression and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in a tick cell line. We introduced fluorescently tagged proteins in ISE6 cells and edited its genome via homology dependent recombination. We ablated the expression of xiap and p47, two signaling molecules present in the immune deficiency (IMD) pathway of I. scapularis. Impairment of the tick IMD pathway, an analogous network of the tumor necrosis factor receptor in mammals, led to enhanced infection of the rickettsial agent A. phagocytophilum. Altogether, our findings provide a critical technical resource to the scientific community to enable a deeper understanding of biological circuits in the blacklegged tick Ixodes scapularis.",

    "abstract": "Gene transfer into hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) involving indiscriminately integrating viral vectors has unpredictable outcomes including potential adverse events such as leukemogenesis, resulting from insertional mutagenesis. Therefore, identifying and characterizing genomic safe harbor (GSH) sites where exogenous genetic information can be integrated safely into adult progenitor and stem cells is critically important for therapeutic gene addition. Here, we present a novel approach to identify new GSH sites based on a proven system of stable transgene insertion: the evolutionarily conserved integration of parvovirus DNA into the germlines of host species. From a dataset of 199 unique endogenous parvovirus element (EPV) integration events identified in host genomes, 102 loci were mapped to the human genome with 17 being evaluated for potential use as GSHs in primary human CD34+ HSPCs. Six of the edited loci resulted in sustained transgene expression in both erythroid and myeloid phenotypes while three exhibited myeloid specific-expression and the remaining four loci resulted in a subset of myeloid and erythroid lineages. Following this approach, a minimum of nine promising GSH sites suitable for gene therapy of blood disorders were identified and additional GSH sites are likely to emerge from the remaining mapped loci which may be suitable for gene addition in stem and progenitor cells other than hematopoietic tissues. This novel approach extends the options for gene knock-ins while reducing the risks of insertional mutagenesis, unpredictable expression profiles, and increasing the safety and therapeutic effects.",

The Drosophila Ets transcription factor Pointed (Pnt) is required for several aspects of eye development and regulates cell cycle progression, specification, and differentiation. Despite its critical role in development, very few targets of Pnt have been reported previously. Here, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) to determine the genome-wide occupancy of Pnt in late larval eye discs. We identified enriched regions that mapped to an average of 6,941 genes, the vast majority of which are novel putative Pnt targets. Integrating ChIP-seq data with two other larval eye single cell genomics datasets (scRNA-seq and snATAC-seq) reveals genes that may be putative cell type-specific genes regulated by Pnt. Finally, our ChIP-seq data predict cell type-specific functional enhancers that were not reported previously.

    "abstract": "Extrachromosomal circular DNAs (ecDNAs) are extrachromosomal circular DNA elements harboring enhancers that can function as mobile transcriptional enhancers to promote oncogene amplification in diverse human cancers. However, little is known about the mechanism how ecDNA and relevant enhancers influence the transcription control in different cancers. Here, we performed a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis to explore the potential transcriptional regulatory network between ecDNA and enhancer, and the association with clinical outcomes in different human cancers. Firstly, we identified 18,385 enhancers on ecDNA in 1,921 samples of 20 TCGA tumors. By integrating corresponding RNA-seq data, we found that the expression levels of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) were significantly different between ecDNA regions and corresponding linear chromosomes. This suggested that enhancers on ecDNA may employ eRNA to perform transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, we identified enhancer co-amplification with oncogenes and found that enhancers on ecDNA significantly affect the expression of co-amplified cancer genes and consequently influence the survival of cancer patients. In addition, we found that, compared to corresponding linear chromosomes, enhancers on ecDNA generally have lower levels of methylation, which may be mainly caused by the enhancer co-amplification with oncogenes. Genome-wide analysis of open chromatin regions revealed significantly higher levels of chromatin accessibility and certain chromosomal preferences in ecDNA regions comparing corresponding linear chromosomes. Moreover, we found that the downregulation of antigen presentation genes and the suppression of antigen presentation pathways may cause the tumor immune evasion mediated by ecDNA. Finally, we identified tumor-infiltrating activated mast cells in ecDNA-positive patients, which are associated with poorer prognosis. In summary, through pan-cancer analysis, we illustrate the characteristics and regulatory mechanisms of ecDNA and its enhancers in cancers, providing insights for future cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "PurposeSmall cell carcinoma of the ovary-hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) is a rare form of ovarian cancer affecting young women and girls. SCCOHT is driven by loss of both SWI/SNF ATPases SMARCA4 and SMARCA2, having major effects on enhancer landscapes. Super-enhancers are a distinct subset of enhancer clusters frequently associated with oncogenes in cancer.\n\nExperimental DesignSCCOHT cell lines and PDX models were interrogated for super-enhancer landscape with H3K27ac CUT&RUN integrated with RNAseq data for associated oncogene analysis. IHC staining and drug efficacy studies in PDX models demonstrate clinical translatability.\n\nResultsHere we discovered key distinctions between SWI/SNF chromatin occupancy following SMARCA4 restoration at enhancer vs. super-enhancer sites and characterized putative oncogene expression driven by super-enhancer activity. SCCOHT super-enhancer target genes were particularly enriched in developmental processes, most notably nervous system development. We found high sensitivity of SCCOHT cell lines to triptolide, a small molecule that targets the XPB subunit of the transcription factor II H (TFIIH) complex, found at super-enhancers. Triptolide inhibits expression of many super-enhancer associated genes, including oncogenes. Notably, SALL4 expression is significantly decreased following short triptolide treatment, and its RNA expression was high in SCCOHT tumors relative to other ovarian cancers. In SCCOHT patient-derived xenograft models, triptolide and its prodrug derivative minnelide are particularly effective in inhibiting tumor growth.\n\nConclusionsThese results demonstrate the key oncogenic role of super-enhancer activity following epigenetic dysfunction in SCCOHT, which can be effectively targeted through inhibition of its functional components, such as TFIIH inhibition with triptolide.\n\nStatement of Translational RelevanceThis work identifies a potential therapeutic strategy for small cell carcinoma of the ovary-hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT), a rare and aggressive ovarian cancer affecting young women and children. This study highlights the role of the loss of SWI/SNF ATPase SMARCA4 in altering super-enhancers to promote high oncogene expression. We discovered that SCCOHT cells exhibited high sensitivity to triptolide, a small molecule derived from Tripterygium wilfordii, which targets the XPB subunit of the transcription factor II H (TFIIH) complex found at super-enhancers. Triptolide inhibits the expression of super-enhancer-associated genes, including oncogenes like SALL4, which is highly expressed in SCCOHT. Moreover, in SCCOHT patient-derived xenograft models, triptolide and its derivative minnelide effectively inhibited tumor growth. These findings suggest that targeting super-enhancer activity could be a promising therapeutic approach for SCCOHT, offering potential clinical benefits to patients who currently face limited treatment options and poor outcomes.",

Macrophages initiate the fibrotic programming of fibroblasts via paracrine factors, but it is unclear if reciprocal responses from the fibroblasts trigger pro-fibrotic programming of macrophages to establish a collaborative feed-forward fibrotic circuit. We identify macrophage-fibroblast cross talk necessary for injury-associated fibrosis, in which macrophages induce interleukin 6 (IL-6) expression in fibroblasts via purinergic receptor P2rx4 signaling and IL-6 induces arginase 1 (Arg1) expression in macrophages. Surprisingly, Arg1 contributes to fibrotic responses by metabolizing arginine to ornithine, which fibroblasts use as a substrate to synthesize proline, a uniquely abundant constituent of fibrillar collagen. Taken together, we define a bidirectional circuit between macrophages and fibroblasts that facilitates cross-feeding metabolism necessary for injury-associated fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "The vaginal microbiota plays a pivotal role in reproductive, sexual, and perinatal health and disease. Unlike the well-established connections between diet, metabolism, and the intestinal microbiota, parallel mechanisms influencing the vaginal microbiota and pathogen colonization remain overlooked. In this study, we combine a mouse model of Streptococcus agalactiae strain COH1 (GBS) vaginal colonization with a mouse model of pubertal-onset obesity to assess diet as a determinant of vaginal microbiota composition and its role in colonization resistance. We leveraged culture-dependent assessment of GBS clearance and culture-independent, sequencing-based reconstruction of the vaginal microbiota in relation to diet, obesity, glucose tolerance, and microbial dynamics across time scales. Our findings demonstrate that excessive body weight gain and glucose intolerance are not associated with vaginal GBS density or timing of clearance. Diets high in fat and low in soluble fiber are associated with vaginal GBS persistence, and changes in vaginal microbiota structure and composition due to diet contribute to GBS clearance patterns in nonpregnant mice. These findings underscore a critical need for studies on diet as a key determinant of vaginal microbiota composition and its relevance to reproductive and perinatal outcomes.\n\nIMPORTANCEThis work sheds light on diet as a key determinant influencing the composition of vaginal microbiota and its involvement in group B Streptococcus (GBS) colonization in a mouse model. The study shows that dietary components, such as dietary fat and soluble fiber, impact GBS density and timing of clearance in the female reproductive tract. These findings are particularly significant given clear links between GBS and adverse reproductive and neonatal outcomes, advancing our understanding by identifying critical connections between dietary components, factors originating from the intestinal tract, vaginal microbiota, and reproductive outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Oligomerization of DNMT3B, a mammalian de novo DNA methyltransferase, critically regulates its chromatin targeting and DNA methylation activities. However, how the N-terminal PWWP and ADD domains interplay with the C-terminal methyltransferase (MTase) domain in regulating the dynamic assembly of DNMT3B remains unclear. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of DNMT3B under various oligomerization states. The ADD domain of DNMT3B interacts with the MTase domain to form an autoinhibitory conformation, resembling the previously observed DNMT3A autoinhibition. Our combined structural and biochemical study further identifies a role for the PWWP domain and its associated ICF mutation in the allosteric regulation of DNMT3B tetramer, and a differential functional impact on DNMT3B by potential ADD-H3K4me0 and PWWP-H3K36me3 bindings. In addition, our comparative structural analysis reveals a coupling between DNMT3B oligomerization and folding of its substrate-binding sites. Together, this study provides mechanistic insights into the allosteric regulation and dynamic assembly of DNMT3B.",

Previously the RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) reader, YTH (YT521-B homology) domain 2 (YTHDF2), has been shown to be O-GlcNAcylated on Ser-263 during Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and promote HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma. Herein we mapped YTHDF2 O-GlcNAcylation at Thr-49 via electron-transfer dissociation mass spectrometry under unperturbed conditions. We show that YTHDF2 Thr-49 O-GlcNAcylation antagonizes Extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent phosphorylation at Ser-39 and promotes YTHDF2 degradation. The downstream signaling pathway of YTHDF2 in lung carcinoma are thus upregulated, which leads to the downregulation of c-Myc. We further used mouse xenograft models to show that YTHDF2-T49A mutants increased lung cancer mass and size. Our work reveals a key role of YTHDF2 O-GlcNAcylation in tumorigenesis and suggests that O-GlcNAcylation exerts distinct functions under different biological stress.",

Its structures had been elusive to the public until recently when one of the crystal forms was solved by MicroED. In this work, we report the MicroED structures of two distinct polymorphic crystal forms of paritaprevir from the same experiment. The different polymorphs show conformational changes in the macrocyclic core, as well as the cyclopropylsulfonamide and methylpyrazinamide substituents. Molecular docking shows that one of the conformations fits well into the active site pocket of the NS3/4A serine protease target, and can interact with the pocket and catalytic triad via hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds. These results can provide further insight for optimization of the binding of acylsulfonamide inhibitors to the NS3/4A serine protease. In addition, this also demonstrate the opportunity of deriving different polymorphs and distinct macrocycle conformations from the same experiments using MicroED.",

    "abstract": "Precise insertion of a fluorescent protein into a lineage-specific gene in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) presents challenges due to the low knockin efficiency and difficulties in selecting the correctly targeted cells. Here we introduce the ModRNA-based Activation for Gene Insertion and Knockin (MAGIK) approach to enhance knockin efficacy in hPSCs. MAGIK operates in two steps: first, it employs a Cas9-2A-p53DD modRNA with a mini-donor plasmid (without a drug-selection cassette) to significantly enhance efficiency; second, a dCas9 activator modRNA and a dgRNA are used to temporarily activate the successfully targeted gene, allowing for live cell sorting without single cell cloning. Consequently, MAGIK eliminates the need for drug selection cassettes or labor-intensive single cell colony screening, expediting precise genetic integration. We have demonstrated that MAGIK can be utilized to insert fluorescent proteins into various genes, including SOX17, NKX6.1, NKX2.5 and PDX1, across multiple hPSC lines, showcasing its robustness. This innovative MAGIK approach streamlines the process and provides a promising solution for targeted genetic modifications in hPSCs.",

Cumbersome isolation from polar fish has limited probing AFGP molecular mechanisms of action and limited developing bioinspired cryoprotectants for application in agriculture, foods, coatings, and biomedicine. Here, we present a rapid, scalable, and tunable route to synthetic AFGPs (sAFGPs) using N-carboxyanhydride polymerization. Our materials are the first mimics to harness the molecular size, chemical motifs, and long-range conformation of native AFGPs. We found that ice-shaping and ice-recrystallization inhibition activity increases with chain length and Ala is a key residue. Glycan structure had only minor effects and all glycans examined displayed antifreeze activity. The sAFGPs are biodegradable, non-toxic, and internalized into endocytosing cells. sAFGPs were found to be bystanders in cryopreservation of human red blood cells. Overall, our sAFGPs functioned as surrogates for bona fide AFGPs, solving a long-standing challenge in access to natural antifreeze materials.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have enabled the identification of phenotypic diversity within breast tumor tissues. However, the contribution of these cell phenotypes to tumor biology and treatment response has remained less understood. This is primarily due to the limited number of available samples and the inherent heterogeneity of breast tumors. To address this limitation, we leverage a state-of-the-art scRNA-seq atlas and employ CIBER-SORTx to estimate cell phenotype fractions by de-convolving bulk expression profiles in more than 2000 samples from patients who have undergone Neoad-juvant Chemotherapy (NAC). We introduce a pipeline based on explainable Machine Learning (XML) to robustly explore the associations between different cell phenotype fractions and the response to NAC in the general population as well as different subtypes of breast tumors. By comparing tumor subtypes, we observe that multiple cell types exhibit a distinct association with pCR within each subtype. Specifically, Dendritic cells (DCs) exhibit a negative association with pathological Complete Response (pCR) in Estrogen Receptor positive, ER+, (Luminal A/B) tumors, while showing a positive association with pCR in ER-(Basal-like/HER2-enriched) tumors. Analysis of new spatial cyclic immunoflu-orescence data and publicly available imaging mass cytometry data showed significant differences in the spatial distribution of DCs between ER subtypes. These variations underscore disparities in the engagement of DCs within the tumor microenvironment (TME), potentially driving their divergent associations with pCR across tumor subtypes. Overall, our findings on 28 different cell types provide a comprehensive understanding of the role played by cellular compo-nents of the TME in NAC outcomes. They also highlight directions for further experimental investigations at a mechanistic level.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of small-molecule allosteric modulators is an emerging paradigm in drug discovery, and signal transduction is a subtle and dynamic process that is challenging to characterize. We developed a time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) imaging approach to investigate the activation mechanism of a druggable protein by a small-molecule allosteric modulator. We tested this approach using the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a), an important pharmacological target that transports Ca2+ at the expense of ATP hydrolysis in the heart. We found that CDN1163, a validated SERCA2a activator, does not dissociate the endogenous complex between SERCA2a and its regulator phospholamban (PLN) in the presence of either Ca2+ or AMP-PCP, a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog. CDN1163 does not influence SERCA2as affinity for Ca2+ ions at functionally relevant conditions. Global analysis of the fluorescence lifetimes showed that ATP is both a substrate and a modulator that populates competent SERCA2a conformations. Interestingly, CDN1163 alone does not significantly induce changes in the structural populations of SERCA2a. Instead, CDN1163 potentiates the effects of ATP to further shift the equilibrium toward a competent SERCA2a conformation. Importantly, this population shift occurs at sub-physiological conditions, and within physiological Ca2+ concentrations at which SERCA2a operates. We propose an activation mechanism whereby a small-molecule modulator synergizes with ATP to stabilize a conformation of SERCA2a primed for activation. This study demonstrates the power of TCSPC to reveal novel insights into how structural and biochemical states are coupled to allosterically activate a pharmacological target in the heart.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous out-of-equilibrium agents or cells in suspension are ubiquitous in biology and engineering. Turning chemical energy into mechanical stress, they generate activity in their environment, which may trigger spontaneous large-scale dynamics. Often, these systems are composed of multiple populations that may reflect the coexistence of multiple species, differing phenotypes, or chemically varying agents in engineered settings. Here, we present a new method for modeling such multi-population active fluids subject to confinement. We use a continuum multi-scale mean-field approach to represent each phase by its first three orientational moments and couple their evolution with those of the suspending fluid. The resulting coupled system is solved using a parallel adaptive level-set-based solver for high computational efficiency and maximal flexibility in the confinement geometry. Motivated by recent experimental work, we employ our method to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of confined bacterial suspensions and swarms dominated by fluid hydrodynamic effects. Our computational explorations reproduce observed emergent collective patterns, including features of active dissolution in two-population active-passive swarms, with results clearly suggesting that hydrodynamic effects dominate dissolution dynamics. Our work lays the foundation for a systematic characterization of natural and synthetic multi-population systems such as bacterial colonies, bird flocks, fish schools, colloidal swimmers, or programmable active matter.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive tumor. Prognosis is poor and survival is low in patients diagnosed with this disease; [~]12% at 5 years. Immunotherapy, including adoptive T cell transfer therapy, has not impacted outcomes in PDAC patients, due in part to the hostile tumor microenvironment (TME) which limits T cell trafficking and persistence. We posit that murine models serve as useful tools to study the fate of T cell therapy. Currently, genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) for PDAC are considered a \"gold-standard\" as they recapitulate many aspects of human disease. However, these models have limitations, including marked tumor variability across individual mice and cost of colony maintenance. We characterized the immunologic features and trafficking patterns of adoptively transferred T cells in orthotopic PDAC models using two mouse cell lines, KPC-Luc and MT-5, isolated from KPC-GEMM mouse models (KrasLSL-G12D/+p53-/- and KrasLSL-G12D/+p53LSL-R172H/+, respectively). The MT-5 orthotopic model best recapitulates the cellular and stromal features of the TME in the PDAC GEMM. In contrast, far more host immune cells infiltrate KPC-Luc tumors, which have less stroma. Albeit CD4+ T cells were similarly detected in MT-5 tumors compared to KPC-GEMM in mice. Interestingly, we found that CAR T cells redirected to recognize mesothelin on these tumors that signal via CD3{sigma} and 41BB (Meso-41BB{sigma}-CAR T cells) post antigen recognition infiltrated the tumors of mice bearing stroma-devoid KPC-Luc orthotopic tumors, but not MT-5 tumors. Our data establish for the first time a reproducible and realistic clinical system useful for modeling stroma-rich and stroma-devoid PDAC tumors. These models shall serve in-depth study of how to overcome barriers that limit anti-tumor activity of adoptively transferred T cells.",

We found that polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1) alters splicing of DPF2, a subunit of BAF chromatin remodeling complexes. Dpf2 exon 7 is inhibited by PTBP1 to produce the DPF2-S isoform early in development. During neuronal differentiation, loss of PTBP1 allows exon 7 splicing, resulting in a longer DPF2-L isoform. Gene expression changes are induced by DPF2-L in ESC, and by DPF2-S in neurons. In ESC, chromatin immunoprecipitation locates DPF2-S but not DPF2-L at sites bound by pluripotency transcription factors. In neuronal progenitors, DPF2-S sites coincide with NFI protein binding, and DPF2-L sites with CTCF. DPF2-S sites show enhancer chromatin modifications, while DPF2-L sites show modifications associated with promoters. In sum, alternative splicing events during neuronal development impact chromatin organization by altering BAF complex targeting.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWEcoacoustics is an emerging science that seeks to understand the role of sound in ecological processes. Passive acoustic monitoring is increasingly being used to collect vast quantities of whole-soundscape audio recordings in order to study variations in acoustic community activity across spatial and temporal scales. However, extracting relevant information from audio recordings for ecological inference is non-trivial. Recent approaches to machine-learned acoustic features appear promising but are limited by inductive biases, crude temporal integration methods and few means to interpret downstream inference. To address these limitations we developed and trained a self-supervised representation learning algorithm -a convolutional Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) -to embed latent features from acoustic survey data collected from sites representing a gradient of habitat degradation in temperate and tropical ecozones and use prediction of survey site as a test case for interpreting inference. We investigate approaches to interpretability by mapping discriminative descriptors back to the spectro-temporal domain to observe how soundscape components change as we interpolate across a linear classification boundary traversing latent feature space; we advance temporal integration methods by encoding a probabilistic soundscape descriptor capable of capturing multi-modal distributions of latent features over time. Our results suggest that varying combinations of soundscape components (biophony, geophony and anthrophony) are used to infer sites along a degradation gradient and increased sensitivity to periodic signals improves on previous research using time-averaged representations for site classification. We also find the VAE is highly sensitive to differences in recorder hardwares frequency response and demonstrate a simple linear transformation to mitigate the effect of hardware variance on the learned representation. Our work paves the way for development of a new class of deep neural networks that afford more interpretable machine-learned ecoacoustic representations to advance the fundamental and applied science and support global conservation efforts.",

The mutation does not affect thermal stability, actin filament nucleation, elongation and turnover. Model building and normal mode analysis predict significant differences in the interaction of p.E334Q-filaments with myosin motors and members of the ADF/cofilin family of actin-binding proteins. Assays probing the interactions of p.E334Q-filaments with human class 2 and class 5 myosin motor constructs show significant reductions in sliding velocity and actin-affinity. E334Q differentially affects cofilin-mediated actin dynamics by increasing the rate of cofilin-mediated de novo nucleation of actin filaments and decreasing the efficiency of cofilin-mediated filament severing. Thus, it is likely that p.E334Q-mediated changes in myosin motor activity, as well as filament turnover contribute to the observed disease phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Na+/H+ exchangers (NHE) are found in all cells to regulate intracellular pH, sodium levels and cell volume. The NHE isoform 9 (SLC9A9) fine-tunes endosomal pH, and its activity is linked to glioblastoma, epilepsy, autism spectrum and attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorders. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of horse NHE9 and a cysteine-variant at 3.6 and 3.1 [A] resolution, respectively. We show how lysine residues, from a previously unresolved TM2-TM3 {beta}-hairpin loop domain, are positioned above the dimerization interface and interact with the endosomal-specific PI-(3,5)P2 lipid, together with residues located on dimer domain helices. Thermal-shift assays, solid-state membrane (SSM) electrophysiology and MD simulations, corroborates that NHE9 can specifically bind PI-(3,5)P2, and that its addition stabilizes the homodimer and enhances NHE9 activity. We have further determined the cryo-EM structure of E. coli NhaA, confirming the expected coordination of cardiolipin at the dimerization interface, solidifying the concept that Na+/H+ exchanger dimerization and transporter activity can be regulated by specific lipids. Taken together, we propose that the activity of NHE9 is regulated by the PI-(3,5)P2 lipid upon reaching endosomes, which we refer to as an lipid-activation-upon-arrival model.",

    "abstract": "PurposeThis study presents a framework for generating patient-specific finite element models, parameterised and optimised for contact mechanics from computed tomography (CT) scans, by avoiding the segmentation step usually employed to transform medical images into 3D models. Two morphological parameters affecting contact mechanics were investigated in the framework development: tibial cartilage thickness and tibial spine height. This study explores the effect of the interplay of these parameters in load sharing between meniscus and articulating cartilage, meniscal posterior and anterior roots strain and menisci kine-matics.\n\nMethodsMorphological measurements from four knee CT scans were collected, such as the maximum thickness of the tibial cartilage (ranging from 1.1 to 5.2 mm), the height of the tibial spine (ranging from 3.55 to 10.1 mm), and the width of the tibial plateau in both the coronal (ranging from 27.3 to 36.17 mm) and sagittal (ranging from 31.79 to 53.77 mm) planes. These measurements were taken for the lateral tibial plateau for both left and right knees. Subsequently, three finite element (FE) models were generated, comprising lateral tibial plateaus, lateral femoral condyle and lateral meniscus. The tibial cartilage thickness was kept at a constant value of 1 mm while varying the tibial spine height within the range measured from the CT images. This resulted in three FE models with varying spine heights, categorised as large (height = 7.42 mm), medium (height = 4.25 mm), and small (height = 1.63 mm) tibial spine heights. The menisci in the FE models were generated to be congruent with the tibial plateau. For the first time, this study advances the representations of the knee menisci microstructure in FE modelling, such that we have generated meniscus FE models with three layers of a hyperelastic model in which layer thickness and layer-specific hyperelastic material parameters are derived from our previous experimental work.\n\nResultsThe load sharing between the meniscus and articular cartilage was not sensitive to the varying tibial spine heights. In all three FE models, cartilage carried more than 90% of the applied load. However, the meniscus kinematics and root strains varied considerably with changing tibial spine heights. The small tibial spine height model predicted the highest meniscus movements (8.12 and 9.33 mm in the radial and circumferential directions, respectively) and the highest root strain (21.92 and 22.19 mm/mm in the anterior and posterior roots, respectively).\n\nConclusionOur framework can generate finite element models of patients knees using clinical data (i.e., CT scans) without the need for lengthy image segmentation. This process is not only time-efficient but also independent of imaging operators. The models converge quickly ({inverted question}30 minutes on 2 cores) using an implicit solver with non-linear geometry and have the capability to predict contact mechanics between the articulating surfaces, meniscus kinematics and root strains. The modelling strategy presented here can provide valuable insights into predicting changes in the mechanics of soft tissues in the knee joint. It is particularly useful for investigating injury and surgical mechanisms related to the meniscus.",

    "abstract": "The ability to image at high speeds is necessary in biological imaging to capture fast-moving or transient events or to efficiently image large samples. However, due to the lack of rigidity of biological specimens, carrying out fast, high-resolution volumetric imaging without moving and agitating the sample has been a challenging problem. Pupil-matched remote focusing has been promising for high NA imaging systems with their low aberrations and wavelength independence, making it suitable for multicolor imaging. However, owing to the incoherent and unpolarized nature of the fluorescence signal, manipulating this emission light through remote focusing is challenging. Therefore, remote focusing has been primarily limited to the illumination arm, using polarized laser light for facilitating coupling in and out of the remote focusing optics. Here we introduce a novel optical design that can de-scan the axial focus movement in the detection arm of a microscope. Our method splits the fluorescence signal into S and P-polarized light and lets them pass through the remote focusing module separately and combines them with the camera. This allows us to use only one focusing element to perform aberration-free, multi-color, volumetric imaging without (a) compromising the fluorescent signal and (b) needing to perform sample/detection-objective translation. We demonstrate the capabilities of this scheme by acquiring fast dual-color 4D (3D space + time) image stacks, with an axial range of 70 m and camera limited acquisition speed. Owing to its general nature, we believe this technique will find its application to many other microscopy techniques that currently use an adjustable Z-stage to carry out volumetric imaging such as confocal, 2-photon, and light sheet variants.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe intima, comprising the endothelium and the subendothelial matrix, plays a crucial role in the development of atherosclerotic plaques, especially in bifurcations and curved segments of arteries. The mechanical stress arising from disturbed blood flow (d-flow) and the stiffening of the arterial wall contributes to endothelial dysfunction. However, the specific impacts of these physical forces on the mechanical environment of the intima remain undetermined. To address this gap in knowledge, we investigated whether inhibiting collagen crosslinking could ameliorate the detrimental effects of persistent d-flow on the mechanical properties of the intima.\n\nMethodsTo explore this hypothesis, we performed partial ligation (PCL) of the left carotid artery (LCA) in male and female C57BL/6J mice, inducing d-flow. The right carotid artery (RCA) served as an internal control. Carotids were collected two days and two weeks after PCL to study acute and chronic effects of d-flow on the mechanical phenotype of the intima. To decouple the chronic effects of d-flow from the ensuing arterial wall stiffening, we used subcutaneous implants delivering either phosphate-buffered saline (Saline) or 150 mg/kg/day of {beta}-aminopropionitrile (BAPN), an inhibitor of elastin and collagen crosslinking lysyl oxidase (LOX) and LOX-like (LOXL) enzymes. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements allowed us to determine stiffness of the endothelium and the denuded subendothelial matrix in en face carotid preparations. In addition, we determined the stiffness of human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) cultured on soft and stiff hydrogels.\n\nResultsAcute exposure to d-flow caused a slight decrease in endothelial stiffness in male mice but had no effect on the stiffness of the subendothelial matrix in either sex. Regardless of sex, the intact endothelium was softer than the subendothelial matrix. In contrast, exposure to chronic d-flow led to a substantial increase in the endothelial and subendothelial stiffness in both sexes. The effects of chronic d-flow were largely prevented by concurrent BAPN administration. Notably, the subendothelial matrix of ligated, BAPN-treated arteries was softer than that of unligated, saline-treated counterparts. Furthermore, HAEC displayed reduced stiffness when cultured on soft vs. stiff hydrogels.\n\nConclusionsExposure to chronic d-flow results in marked stiffening of arterial intima, which can be effectively prevented by pharmacological inhibition of LOX/LOXL enzymes.\n\nHighlightsO_LIAcute exposure to d-flow slightly softens the endothelium in males.\nC_LIO_LIChronic exposure to d-flow causes stiffening of the arterial intima.\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of LOX/LOXL enzymes prevents intimal stiffening arising from chronic d-flow.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Transforming Growth Factor {beta} (TGF{beta}) is a pleiotropic cytokine closely linked to tumors. TGF{beta} is often elevated in precancerous breast lesions in association with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), indicating its contribution to precancerous progression. We previously reported that basal nitric oxide (NO) levels declined along with breast cancer progression. We then pharmacologically inhibited NO production in healthy mammary glands of wild-type mice and found that this induced precancerous progression accompanied by desmoplasia and upregulation of TGF{beta} activity. In the present study, we tested our hypothesis that NO directly S-nitrosylates (forms an NO-adduct at a cysteine residue) TGF{beta} to inhibit the activity, whereas the reduction of NO denitrosylates TGF{beta} and de-represses the activity. We introduced mutations to three C-terminal cysteines of TGF{beta}1 which were predicted to be S-nitrosylated. We found that these mutations indeed impaired S-nitrosylation of TGF{beta}1 and shifted the binding affinity towards the receptor from the latent complex. Furthermore, in silico structural analyses predicted that these S-nitrosylation-defective mutations strengthen the dimerization of mature protein, whereas S-nitrosylation-mimetic mutations weaken the dimerization. Such differences in dimerization dynamics of TGF{beta}1 by denitrosylation/S-nitrosylation likely account for the shift of the binding affinities towards the receptor vs. latent complex. Our findings, for the first time, unravel a novel mode of TGF{beta} regulation based on S-nitrosylation or denitrosylation of the protein.\n\nSignificance statementTransforming Growth Factor {beta} (TGF{beta}) is a widely studied cytokine associated with tumors. Because of its pleiotropic functions and dichotomous roles in tumorigenesis, the development of therapeutics targeted to TGF{beta} for cancer treatment has been challenging. In the present study, we report that TGF{beta} is indeed S-nitrosylated at specific sites for repressing its functions, whereas it is denitrosylated to derepress its activity. Such covalent modification-based regulation of TGF{beta} activity could potentially be utilized to design a new type of inhibitor or activator of the protein.",

Through integrative studies of Lkb1-deficient KRASG12Cand KrasG12D lung cancer mouse models and/or organoids treated with KRAS inhibitors, we found tumor cells invoked a lineage plasticity program: adeno-to-squamous transition (AST) that mediated resistance to KRAS inhibition. Transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses revealed {Delta}Np63 drives AST and modulates response to KRAS inhibition. We identified an intermediate high-plasticity cell state with distinct gene expression program marked by Krt6a upregulation.

Because the high social status, prolonged receptivity, and characteristic sexual behaviors of females gathered the attention of researchers, the behaviors of male bonobos have only been the focus of a small number of studies. In addition, most studies comparing the behaviors of chimpanzees and bonobos have been based on data obtained using different methods. In this study, using the same observation method, we investigated party attendance and aggressive interactions among male bonobos in Wamba and male chimpanzees in Kalinzu. Male bonobos did not show the tendencies of a high degree of dispersion that male chimpanzees showed in the absence of receptive females. The aggressive behaviors between males within a group were not significantly different in the frequency of overall aggressive interactions per observation unit between the two species. However, the types of aggressive behaviors observed differed between the species. In bonobos, severe aggressive interactions such as aggressive physical contact among adult males were not observed, and most aggression occurred between the sons of the two highest-ranking females. In bonobos, females participated in polyadic aggressive behaviors as the aggressor, whereas all cases of coalitionary aggression in chimpanzees were from male aggressors. These results suggest the considerable influence of female behaviors on the substantial differences in aggressive interactions between the two species. This study highlights both similarities and differences in male aggression between bonobos and chimpanzees using the same method.",

To witness functional connections in living animals, we developed a tracer detectible by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Mn(II). Mn(II) relies on kinesin-1 and amyloid-precursor protein to travel out axons. Within 24h, projection fields of cortical neurons can be mapped brain-wide with this technology. MnCl2 was stereotactically injected either into anterior cingulate area (ACA) or into infralimbic/prelimbic (IL/PL) of medial forebrain (n=10-12). Projections were imaged, first by manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) live, and then after fixation by microscopy. MR images were collected at 100{micro}m isotropic resolution ([~]5 neurons) in 3D at four time points: before and at successive time points after injections. Images were preprocessed by masking non-brain tissue, followed by intensity scaling and spatial alignment. Actual injection locations, measured from post-injection MR images, were found to be 0.06, 0.49 and 0.84mm apart between cohorts, in R-L, A-P, and D-V directions respectively. Mn(II) enhancements arrived in hindbrains by 24h in both cohorts, while co-injected rhodamine dextran was not detectible beyond immediate subcortical projections. Data-driven unbiased voxel-wise statistical maps after ACA injections revealed significant progression of Mn(II) distally into deeper brain regions: globus pallidus, dorsal striatum, amygdala, hypothalamus, substantia nigra, dorsal raphe and locus coeruleus. Accumulation was quantified as a fraction of total volume of each segment containing significantly enhanced voxels (fractional accumulation volumes), and results visualized in column graphs. Unpaired t-tests between groups of brain-wide voxel-wise intensity profiling by either region of interest (ROI) measurements or statistical parametric mapping highlighted distinct differences in distal accumulation between injection sites, with ACA projecting to periaqueductal gray and IL/PL to basolateral amygdala (p<0.001 FDR). Mn(II) distal accumulations differed dramatically between injection groups in subdomains of the hypothalamus, with ACA targeting dorsal medial, periventricular region and mammillary body nuclei, while IL/PL went to anterior hypothalamic areas and lateral hypothalamic nuclei. Given that these hypothalamic subsegments communicate activity in the central nervous system to the body, these observations describing distinct forebrain projection fields will undoubtedly lead to newer insights in mind-body relationships.",

    "abstract": "Early life adversity (ELA) predisposes individuals to both physical and mental disorders lifelong. How ELA affects brain function leading to this vulnerability is under intense investigation. Research has begun to shed light on ELA effects on localized brain regions within defined circuits. However, investigations into brain-wide neural activity that includes multiple localized regions, determines relationships of activity between regions and identifies shifts of activity in response to experiential conditions is necessary. Here, we performed longitudinal manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) to image the brain in normally reared or ELA-exposed adults. Images were captured in the freely moving home cage condition, and short- and long-term after naturalistic threat. Images were analyzed with new computational methods, including automated segmentation and fractional activation or difference volumes. We found that neural activity was increased after ELA compared to normal rearing in multiple brain regions, some of which are involved in defensive and/or reward circuitry. Widely distributed patterns of neural activity, \"brain states\", and their dynamics after threat were altered with ELA. Upon acute threat, ELA-mice retained heightened neural activity within many of these regions, and new hyperactive responses emerged in monoaminergic centers of the mid- and hindbrain. Nine days after acute threat, heightened neural activity remained within locus coeruleus and increased within posterior amygdala, ventral hippocampus, and dorso- and ventromedial hypothalamus, while reduced activity emerged within medial prefrontal cortical regions (prelimbic, infralimbic, anterior cingulate). These results reveal that functional imbalances arise between multiple brain-systems which are dependent upon context and cumulative experiences after ELA.\n\nSignificance StatementEarly life adversity (ELA) is a crucial determinant of adult health. Yet, the neurobiological basis for this association remains elusive. Neural activity differs within localized brain regions in rodents who experienced ELA, yet how this localized activity contributes to overall brain states has hitherto been unknown. Here we used longitudinal manganese-enhanced MRI to reveal brain-wide activities altered by ELA compared to normal rearing. Advanced computational analyses unveiled widespread reconfiguration of segment-wise neural activity throughout the brain across a series of conditions: freely moving, experiencing threat or its aftermath. These brain state dynamics were unique to ELA. Reconfiguration of brain states after ELA, shown here for the first time, may underlie predisposition to mental and physical disorders after childhood adversity.",

Parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons have been associated with multiple pre- and post-synaptic impairments that affect various brain regions. Specifically, previous results have suggested that alterations in hippocampal networks may be related to PV+ interneurons dysfunction. In this study, we used the Df1 mouse model that carries the 22q11 deletion to examine the excitability of PV+ cells in the dorsal CA1 region of the hippocampus, due to its importance in memory and cognition. We found that PV+ interneurons were hyperexcitable in this region. To understand the source of the altered excitability, we measured potassium currents, highly involved in the intrinsic firing properties of neurons. We observed that voltage-gated potassium channel subfamily A member 1 (Kv1.1) was impaired in PV+ cells. Specific activation of this channel recovered some of the excitability disturbances observed in Df1 mice. Furthermore, blockade of synaptic inputs also restored PV+ interneurons excitability. Taken together, these results suggest that PV excitability is increased in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and it is partially mediated by Kv1.1 in a mouse model of 22q11DS.",

    "abstract": "Criollo cattle, descendants of animals brought by Iberian colonists to the Americas, have been subject to centuries of natural and human-mediated selection in novel tropical agroecological zones. Consequently, these breeds have evolved distinct characteristics such as resistance to disease and exceptional heat tolerance. In addition to European taurine (Bos taurus) ancestry, it has been proposed that gene flow from African taurine and Asian zebu (Bos indicus) cattle has shaped the ancestry of Criollo cattle. In this study, we analysed Criollo breeds from Colombia and Venezuela using whole genome sequencing data to examine population structure and admixture at very high resolution. We did not detect evidence of African taurine admixture in Criollo cattle; however, there was evidence of longstanding zebu ancestry in one breed (Harton del Valle). In addition, we detected selection signatures associated with a myriad of adaptive traits, revealing genes linked to thermotolerance, reproduction, fertility, immunity, and distinct coat and skin coloration traits. This study underscores the remarkable adaptability of Criollo cattle and highlights the genetic richness and potential of these breeds in the face of climate change, habitat flux, and disease challenges. Further research is warranted to leverage these findings for more effective and sustainable cattle breeding programmes.",
