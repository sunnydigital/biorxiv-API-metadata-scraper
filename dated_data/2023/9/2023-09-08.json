    "abstract": "AbstractNOL1/NOP2/Sun domain family, member 5 (NSUN5) is an enzyme belonging to the 5-methylcytosine (m5C) writer family that modifies rRNA and mRNA. By re-analyzing published RNA-sequencing data, we found that Nsun5 expression was increased at the 2-cell stage during mouse preimplantation development. It has been reported that m5C regulates the stability of rRNA and mRNA. Therefore, NSUN5 may affect the expression of genes required for the development and differentiation of early mouse embryos via its role in modifying RNA. The Hippo signaling pathway has been identified as a critical regulator of the segregation of inner cell mass and trophectoderm lineages during mouse embryogenesis. According to these findings, we hypothesized that NSUN5 controls cell differentiation by regulating the expression of components of the Hippo signaling pathway in mouse early embryos. Using Nsun5-specific small interfering RNAs, we efficiently knocked down Nsun5 expression in mouse preimplantation embryos, resulting in impairments in early development, including reduced blastocyst formation, smaller size, and impaired hatching from the zona pellucida. Nsun5 depletion also led to decreased cell numbers, suggesting impaired cell proliferation. Furthermore, Nsun5 knockdown embryos exhibited reduced yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) nuclear translocation during the morula stage, potentially affecting cell differentiation. The imbalance in pluripotent and trophectoderm lineages was evident with a significant reduction in the ratio of CDX2-positive cells to OCT4-positive cells. Nsun5 depletion impacted the Hippo signaling pathway, increasing the expression of the key genes Lats1 and Lats2 during the morula stage. Our findings underscore the essential role of Nsun5 in early embryonic development by affecting cell proliferation, YAP1 nuclear translocation, and the Hippo pathway. Understanding the roles of Nsun5 in mouse early embryos will provide insights into complex regulatory networks in development, with implications for reproductive medicine and fertility research.",

    "abstract": "Populations closer together in space are more likely to experience shared environmental fluctuations. This correlation in experienced environmental conditions is the main driver of spatial population synchrony, defined as the tendency for geographically separate populations of the same species to exhibit parallel fluctuations in abundance over time. Morans theorem states that spatially distinct populations are expected to show the same synchrony in their population dynamics as the synchrony in their environment. However, this is rarely the case in the wild, and the population synchrony of different species inhabiting the same area is rarely similar. These species-specific differences in how the environment synchronizes populations can be due to life history traits that make some species more susceptible to environmental stochasticity, such as reduced mobility or faster pace of life. In this study, we compiled long-term annual abundance datasets on European birds and insects (Lepidoptera sp. and Bombus sp.) to identify how environmental synchrony (i.e., positively spatially correlated fluctuations in the environment, also called the Moran effect) affects species population synchrony. As expected, the environment synchronized populations of both birds and insects. Populations experiencing correlated fluctuations in precipitation or temperature had higher synchrony in annual population growth rates. Birds were more strongly synchronized by temperature, while precipitation was a stronger driver of synchrony in insects. In birds, species with short generation times had a stronger synchronizing effect of the environment compared to species with long generation times. Moreover, in birds the effects of synchrony in the environment also depended on movement propensity, with a positive impact for resident and short-distance migration species. In insects, annual population synchrony was affected by species movement propensity and dietary niche breadth, but these traits did not modify the effects of environmental synchrony. Our study provides empirical support for the prediction that spatial correlation in population dynamics is more influenced by environmental stochasticity for life histories with lower mobility and faster pace of life, but only in birds. By quantifying spatial population synchrony across different levels of environmental synchrony and life history traits, our study improves the understanding of the Moran effect as well as factors that drive population persistence in the face of environmental change.",

    "abstract": "Prediction and management of zoonotic pathogen spillover requires an understanding of infection dynamics within reservoir host populations. Transmission risk is often assessed using prevalence of infected hosts, with infection status based on the presence of genomic material. However, detection of viral genomic material alone does not necessarily indicate the presence of infectious virus, which could decouple prevalence from transmission risk. We undertook a multi-faceted investigation of Hendra virus shedding in Pteropus bats, combining insights from virus isolation, viral load proxies, viral prevalence, and longitudinal patterns of shedding, from 6,151 samples. In addition to seasonal and interannual fluctuation in prevalence, we found evidence for periodic shifts in the distribution of viral loads. The proportion of bats shedding high viral loads was higher during peak prevalence periods during which spillover events were observed, and lower during non-peak periods when there were no spillovers. We suggest that prolonged periods of low viral load and low prevalence reflect prolonged shedding of non-infectious RNA, or viral loads that are insufficient or unlikely to overcome dose barriers to spillover infection. These findings show that incorporating viral load (or proxies of viral load) into longitudinal studies of virus excretion will better inform predictions of spillover risk than prevalence alone.\n\nSignificance statementWe present a comprehensive analysis of a high-profile bat-virus system (Hendra virus in Australian flying-foxes) to demonstrate that both prevalence and viral loads can shift systematically over time, resulting in concentrated periods of increased spillover risk when prevalence and viral loads are high. We further suggest that prolonged periods of low-prevalence, low-load shedding may not reflect excretion of infectious virus, resolving the outstanding puzzle of why spillovers have not been observed during periods of low off-season prevalence in subtropical Australia, or more frequently in tropical Australia despite consistent low-prevalence shedding. The consideration of viral loads (or proxies of viral load) along with prevalence may improve risk inference from longitudinal surveys of zoonotic viruses across wildlife reservoir hosts.",

    "abstract": "Sequence variants in TMEM106B have been associated with an increased risk of developing several different types of dementia. As part of our efforts to generate a set of mouse lines in which we replaced the mouse Tmem106b gene with a human TMEM106B gene comprised of either a risk or protective haplotype, we conducted an in-depth sequence analysis of these alleles. We identified an AluYb8 insertion in the 3 untranslated region (3UTR) of the TMEM106B risk haplotype. We analyzed transcribed TMEM106B sequences using RNA-seq data available through the AD Knowledge portal and full genome sequences from the 1000Genomes databases and found that every risk allele analyzed shares this same AluYb8 insertion. The allele frequency of the risk haplotype ranges from 26% to 60% in the populations examined, and the balance of the alleles in each population is the protective haplotype. The primary sequence features of both haplotypes are distinct from the variants found in other primates. We conclude that the risk haplotype arose early in human development with a single Alu-insertion event within a unique haplotype context. Together these two non-ancestral allele variant types now appear to constitute the vast majority of the TMEM106B alleles but neither has come to fully predominate in any modern human population.",

S. cerevisiae strains each contain dozens to hundreds of strain specific genes. In addition to a variable content of retrotransposons, some strains contain a novel transposable element, Ty7. Examination further shows that some annotated putative protein coding genes are likely artifacts. We propose altering approximately 5% of the current annotations in the widely used reference strain S288c. Potential null alleles are common and found in all 94 strains examined, with these potential null alleles typically containing a single stop codon or frameshift. There are also gene remnants, pseudogenes, and variable arrays of genes. Among the core genes there are now only 373 protein coding genes of unknown function, classified as uncharacterized in the Saccharomyces Genome Database. This work suggests that there is a role for carefully edited and annotated genome sequences in understanding the genome organization and content of a species. We propose that gene remnants be added to the repertoire of features found in the S. cerevisiae genome, and likely other fungal species.",

    "abstract": "Fungal plant pathogens constantly evolve and deploy novel peptide and metabolite effectors to break down plant resistance and adapt to new host plants. The blast fungal pathogen Pyricularia oryzae is a single species subdivided into multiple host-specific lineages. This host specialization is likely due to secreted effectors, including metabolite effectors. Here, we mined 68 genomes of P. oryzae, belonging to six host-specific lineages, to identify secondary metabolite (SM) biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) associated with host specialization. A similarity network analysis grouped a total of 4,501 BGCs into 283 gene cluster families (GCFs), based on the content and architecture of the BGCs. While most of the GCFs were present in all the P. oryzae lineages, two were found specifically in the Oryza lineage and one was found in the lineage specific to Triticum, Lolium and Eleusine hosts. Further analysis of the phylogenetic relationships between core biosynthetic genes confirmed that a BGC, comprising a reducing polyketide synthase (PKS) gene (MGG_08236) and four putative tailoring genes, was present only in the Oryza lineage. The predicted BGC was found expressed specifically during host penetration and colonization. We propose that this Oryza lineage-specific BGC is likely associated with a metabolite effector involved in specialization of P. oryzae to rice host. Our findings highlight the importance of further exploring the role of metabolite effectors in specialization of the blast fungus to different cereal hosts.",

To address this, we describe here \"Poke And Delayed Drink Intertemporal Choice Task (POKE-ADDICT)\", an open-source, versatile, and cost-effective apparatus for intertemporal choice testing in rodents. This allows quantification of delay discounting (DD), a cross-species phenomenon observed in decision making which provides valuable insights into higher-order cognitive functioning. In DD, the subjective value of a delayed reward is reduced as a function of the delay for its receipt. Using our apparatus, we implemented an effective intertemporal choice paradigm for the quantification of DD based on an adjusting delayed amount (ADA) algorithm using mango juice as a reward. Our paradigm requires limited training and can be directly translated to human subjects using monetary rewards. Our apparatus comprises a few 3D-printed parts and inexpensive electrical components, including a Raspberry Pi control unit. Furthermore, it is compatible with several in vivo procedures and the use of nose pokes instead of levers allows for faster task learning. Beside the main application described here, the apparatus can be further extended to implement other behavioral tests and protocols, including standard operant conditioning. In conclusion, we describe a versatile and cost-effective design based on Raspberry Pi that can support research in animal behavior, decision making and, more specifically, delay discounting.",

    "abstract": "Protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) play a crucial role in countless biological processes, profoundly modulating protein properties on both the spatial and temporal scales. Protein PTMs have also emerged as reliable biomarkers for several diseases. However, only a handful of techniques are available to accurately measure their levels, capture their complexity at a single molecule level and characterize their multifaceted roles in health and disease. Nanopore sensing provides high sensitivity for the detection of low-abundance proteins, holding the potential to impact single-molecule proteomics and PTM detection in particular. Here, we demonstrate the ability of a biological nanopore, the pore-forming toxin aerolysin, to detect and distinguish -synuclein-derived peptides bearing single or multiple PTMs, namely phosphorylation, nitration and oxidation occurring at different positions and in various combinations. The characteristic current signatures of the -synuclein peptide and its PTM variants could be confidently identified using a deep learning model for signal processing. We further demonstrate that this framework can quantify -synuclein peptides at picomolar concentration and detect the C-terminal peptides generated by digestion of full-length -synuclein. Collectively, our work highlights the unique advantage of using nanopore as a tool for simultaneous detection of multiple PTMs and paves the way for their use in biomarker discovery and diagnostics.",

While normal cells load replication origins in abundance to the genome, cancer cells often load fewer origins of replication due to genomic alterations such as CCNE1 amplifications.\n\nHere we exploit this feature to sensitize cancer cells to ATR inhibition.\n\nWe show by using siRNA and small molecules that the inhibition of origin activation as well as the reduction of replication origins itself sensitizes ovarian cancer cell lines against ATR inhibition by inducing genomic instability. We further show that in ovarian cancer cells this combinatorial approach leads to an increased genomic instability which manifests in an increase of micronuclei that consequently activate the innate immune system through the cGAS-STING pathway. Notably, no activation of the innate immune system was observed in immortalized fallopian tube cells. However, overexpression of Cyclin E1 in this model leads to a marked increase in genomic instability and innate immune activation.\n\nHere we provide preclinical evidence to increase the therapeutic efficacy of ATR inhibitors.

However, the exact mechanisms of how G-quadruplex structures may affect gene expression remain to be elucidated. We employed experimentally defined G-quadruplex forming DNA sequences and generated transcriptomes for several Bloom Syndrome patient-derived cell lines and BLM-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells to further investigate the effect of G-quadruplexes on gene expression. Our results do not support the previous findings that G-quadruplexes located within a gene play a major role in altering its expression in BLM-deficient cells. We found concerted large-scale changes in transcript abundance, splicing, nucleosome occupancy, and phasing, that cannot be linked to the local presence of G-quadruplex sequences in either gene bodies or promotors. The investigation of genomic features associated with large-scale differences in nucleosome density highlights the rDNA locus and active enhancers as the most strongly affected regions.

Surprisingly, no culturable specimen or genome of this taxon has ever been reported, so its role in AD has remained unclear. In the present work, thirty samples derived from anaerobic digesters were sequenced, allowing the reconstruction of 108 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) potentially belonging to MBA03. According to phylogenetic analyses and genomic similarity indices, MBA03 constitutes a new bacterial order, proposed as Darwinibacteriales ord. nov., which includes Darwinibacter acetoxidans gen. nov., sp. nov. of the family Darwinibacteriaceae fam. nov., along with Wallacebacter cryptica gen. nov., sp. nov. of the Wallacebacteriaceae fam. nov. Ecotaxonomic studies determined that AD processes are the main ecological niche of Darwinibacteriales. Moreover, metabolic predictions identified Darwinibacteraceae members as putative syntrophic acetate oxidising bacteria (SAOB), as they encode for the reversed Wood-Ljungdahl pathway coupled to the glycine cleavage system. This suggests that Darwinibacteraceae members work in collaboration with hydrogenotrophic archaea to produce methane in industrial biogas plants. Overall, our findings present Darwinibacteriales as a potential key player in anaerobic digestion and pave the way towards the complete characterisation of this newly described bacterial taxa.",

    "abstract": "Many dominant genetic disorders result from protein-altering mutations, acting primarily through dominant-negative (DN), gain-of-function (GOF), and loss-of-function (LOF) mechanisms. Deciphering the mechanisms by which dominant diseases exert their effects is often experimentally challenging and resource intensive, but is essential for developing appropriate therapeutic approaches. Diseases that arise via a LOF mechanism are more amenable to be treated by conventional gene therapy, whereas DN and GOF mechanisms may require gene editing or targeting by small molecules. Moreover, pathogenic missense mutations that act via DN and GOF mechanisms are more difficult to identify than those that act via LOF using nearly all currently available variant effect predictors. Here, we introduce a tripartite statistical model made up of support vector machine binary classifiers trained to predict whether human protein-coding genes are likely to be associated with DN, GOF, or LOF molecular disease mechanisms. We test the utility of the predictions by examining biologically and clinically meaningful properties known to be associated with the mechanisms. Our results strongly support that the models are able to generalise on unseen data and offer insight into the functional attributes of proteins associated with different mechanisms. We hope that our predictions will serve as a springboard for researchers studying novel variants and those of uncertain clinical significance, guiding variant interpretation strategies and experimental characterisation.

    "abstract": "IntroductionThe occurrence of obesity-related hepatic malignancies differs between sexes, suggesting the involvement of sex hormones. Female sex hormones maintain cell homeostasis through estrogen receptor (ER) signaling and protect from developing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in mice and humans.\n\nRationaleTo understand recovery from high-fat diet (HFD)-induced liver disease in males upon estrogen treatment, we comprehensively characterized molecular changes in the liver upon selective activation of estrogen receptors (ERs) to identify novel therapeutic targets downstream of estrogen signaling.\n\nMethodsTo dissect hepatic ER isoform-driven responses, we integrated liver transcriptomes from female and male HFD mice treated with or without four different estrogen agonists, along with multiomics data, including bulk, single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, chromatin profiling, machine learning models and advanced microscopy. Patient cohorts and primary human hepatocyte spheroids datasets were included.\n\nResultsOnly males developed liver steatosis. We found that selective activation of either ER or ER{beta} reduced HFD-induced hepatic steatosis in male mice. Systemic ER activation restored HFD-induced aberrant gene expression of cellular processes across liver cell types, including hepatocytes. Profiling of marked histones revealed that ER activation modulated promoter and enhancer sites and identified 68 estrogen-sensitive enhancer-gene pairs. Most of these genes were similarly deregulated in human nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients, including the transcription factor TEAD1. TEAD1 expression increased in NAFLD patients, and inhibiting TEAD ameliorated steatosis in spheroids by suppressing lipogenic pathways.\n\nConclusionsSystemic activation of ER or ER{beta} modulates molecular pathways in the liver to counteract NAFLD. Our study identified TEAD1 as a key ER-sensitive gene and suggested that its inhibition poses a therapeutic strategy to combat NAFLD without the undesired side effects elicited by estrogen signaling.\n\nClinical research relevanceWe identified drug targets downstream of estrogen signaling, including TEAD1, and demonstrate that TEAD inhibition improves steatosis by suppressing lipogenic pathways.\n\nBasic research relevanceThe targeted activation of nuclear ERs recovers high-fat diet-induced molecular and physiological liver phenotypes by remodeling core pathways beyond lipid metabolism. ER-responsive enhancers regulate central metabolic genes of clinical significance in NAFLD patients, highlighting the potential impact of this research on understanding liver cell plasticity.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIsteatosis in livers of high-fat diet (HFD) male mice was effectively reduced by selective activation of estrogen receptors (ER and ER{beta}) with four different agonists.\nC_LIO_LIER agonist treatments successfully reversed HFD-induced changes in gene regulation and expression, revealing new treatment targets involving previously unconnected molecular pathways.\nC_LIO_LIestrogen-sensitive enhancers regulated important genes, including TEAD1, emerging as pivotal NAFLD regulators significantly impacting metabolic processes.\nC_LIO_LIhigh TEAD1 gene expression in NAFLD patients correlated with disease severity, underscoring its clinical significance in disease progression.\nC_LIO_LIinhibiting TEAD with small molecules alleviated steatosis by suppressing lipogenic pathways, resembling some of the same beneficial effects as estrogen treatment.\nC_LI",

Several of these proteins have been identified across the bacterial phyla. DciA is the most common loading protein in bacteria, yet the one whose mechanism is the least understood. We have previously shown that VcDciA from Vibrio cholerae, composed of a globular KH-like domain followed by an unfolded extension, has a strong affinity for DNA. Here, we characterized the droplets formed by VcDciA upon interaction with a short single-stranded substrate. We demonstrate the fluidity of these droplets using light microscopy and address their network organization through electron microscopy, thereby bridging events to conclude on a liquid-liquid phase separation behavior. Additionally, we observe the recruitment of VcDnaB inside the VcDciA-DNA droplets. We show that DnaC from Escherichia coli is also competent to form these condensate structures in the presence of ssDNA. Our data open up possibilities for the involvement of DciA in the formation of non-membrane compartments within the bacterium, facilitating the assembly of replication players with the chromosomal DNA.",

    "abstract": "The devastating soybean rust (SBR) pathogen, Phakopsora pachyrhizi, encodes many secreted proteins, but only two have been functionally characterized for their roles in rust virulence. Here, we demonstrate that transient expression of P. pachyrhizi effector candidate 15 (PpEC15), an aspartic protease, leads to enhanced bacterial growth in planta, suppression of callose deposition, reduced expression of plant defense-related marker genes and suppression of pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). Stable expression of PpEC15 in soybean suppresses PAMP-induced ROS production and enhances bacterial growth, indicating that, collectively, PpEC15 suppresses host and non-host innate immune responses. Yeast-two-hybrid and proximity labeling identified putative PpEC15 interacting partners including a peptide-chain release factor (PCRF), a NAC83 (NAM, ATAF, and CUC) transcription factor, and a DAHP (3-deoxy-7-phosphoheptulonate) synthase. We further show that PpEC15 can cleave DAHP but does not cleave PCRF or NAC83. Virus-induced gene silencing of NAC83, PCRF and DAHP altered PAMP-induced ROS production and salicylic acid production, indicating that these proteins may be involved in immune signaling. Collectively, our data show that PpEC15 is conserved across P. pachyrhizi isolates and other economically important rust species and is involved in the suppression of plant basal defense responses. Understanding the role of PpEC15 in P. pachyrhizi virulence will provide a foundation for designing targeted intervention strategies to generate rust-resistant crops.",

The AD patients shared 3,983 stereotypic non-naive BCR clonotypes not found in CG, and their degree of overlap between patient pairs were significantly higher than that of CG pairs, even with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein triggering a concerted BCR response. Twenty stereotypic non-naive AD patient-specific BCR clonotypes co-existed in more than four patients and persisted throughout two sampling points.

    "abstract": "The virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the current COVID-19 pandemic. It possesses a large 30 kilobase (kb) genome that encodes structural, non-structural, and accessory proteins. Although not necessary to cause disease, these accessory proteins are known to influence viral replication and pathogenesis. Through the synthesis of novel infectious clones of SARS-CoV-2 that lack one or more of the accessory proteins of the virus, we have found that one of these accessory proteins, ORF8, is critical for the modulation of the host inflammatory response. Mice infected with a SARS-CoV-2 virus lacking ORF8 exhibit increased weight loss and exacerbated macrophage infiltration into the lungs. Additionally, infection of mice with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 viruses encoding ORF8 mutations found in variants of concern reveal that naturally occurring mutations in this protein influence disease severity. Our studies with a virus lacking this ORF8 protein and viruses possessing naturally occurring point mutations in this protein demonstrate that this protein impacts pathogenesis.\n\nSignificanceSince its emergence in 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has accrued mutations throughout its 30kb genome. Of particular interest are the mutations present in the ORF8 protein, which occur in every major variant. The precise function and impact of this protein on disease severity and pathogenesis remains understudies. Our studies reveal that the ORF8 protein modulates the immune response by impacting macrophage infiltration into the lungs. Additionally, we have shown that the ORF8 protein of SARS-CoV-2 has accrued mutations throughout its evolution that lead to a loss of function phenotype in this protein. Our work reveals that the ORF8 protein of SARS-CoV-2 contributes significantly to disease progression through modulation of the inflammatory response.",

    "abstract": "The cohesin complex maintains sister chromatid cohesion from S phase to anaphase onset. Cohesin also plays roles in chromosome structure and DNA repair. At anaphase onset, the cohesin subunit Scc1 is cleaved to allow segregation in an orderly manner, although some residual cohesin subunits remain to maintain chromosome structure. Efficient DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination (HR) with the sister chromatid also depends on cohesin. Here, we have tested whether residual cohesin is important during DSB repair in anaphase/telophase (late mitosis). Using the well-established MAT switching system, we first show that HR is molecularly functional in late mitosis, and then show that cohesin is required for its efficiency. During DSBs in late mitosis, the segregated sister loci get closer and have episodes of coalescence, which may favour repair by HR. Here, we also show that these cytological phenotypes also depend on cohesin. Finally, full-length Scc1 returns after DSBs in late mitosis, suggesting that de novo widespread cohesin complexes can support these retrograde behaviours.",

    "abstract": "Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident secretory protein that reduces inflammation and promotes proliferation in pancreatic {beta} cells. Numerous studies have highlighted the potential of MANF as a therapeutic agent for diabetes mellitus (DM), making it essential to understand the mechanisms underlying MANFs functions. In our previous search for a molecule that mediates MANF signaling, we identified Neuroplastin (NPTN) as a binding partner of MANF that localizes on the cell surface. However, the roles of NPTN in pancreatic {beta} cells remain unclear. In this study, we generated {beta} cell-specific Nptn knockout (KO) mice and conducted metabolic characterization. NPTN deficiency improved glucose tolerance by increasing insulin secretion and {beta} cell mass in the pancreas. Moreover, proliferation and mitochondrial numbers in {beta} cells increased in Nptn KO islets. These phenotypes resulted from elevated cytosolic Ca2+ levels and subsequent activation of downstream molecules. Simultaneously, we demonstrated that NPTN induces the expression of proinflammatory cytokines via the TRAF6-NF-{kappa}B axis in {beta} cells. Additionally, NPTN deficiency conferred resistance to STZ-induced diabetic phenotypes. Finally, exogenous MANF treatment in islets or {beta} cells led to similar phenotypes as those observed in NPTN-deficient models. These results indicate that NPTN plays important roles in the regulation of insulin secretion, proliferation, and mitochondrial quantity, as well as pro-inflammatory responses, which are antagonized by MANF treatment. Thus, targeting the MANF-NPTN interaction may lead to a novel treatment for improving {beta} cell functions in diabetes mellitus.\n\nSignificance statementMesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident small secretory protein that has the potential as therapeutic agent for various diseases related to inflammation and ER stress, such as Type 1 diabetes mellitus.

We demonstrated NPTN regulates Ca2+ dynamics as well as inflammation in pancreatic {beta} cells. NPTN deficiency caused improved insulin secretion as well as the resistance to Type 1 diabetic phenotypes. We also found out that MANF treatment leads to similar phenotypes observed in NPTN deficient models through antagonizing NPTNs functions.

    "abstract": "The {beta}-(1,3)-glucan laminarin functions as storage polysaccharide in marine stramenophiles such as diatoms. Laminarin is abundant, water-soluble and structured simply, making it an attractive substrate for marine bacteria. As a consequence, many marine bacteria have developed competitive strategies to scavenge and decompose laminarin, which involves carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) as key players. We therefore functionally and structurally characterized two yet unassigned domains as laminarin-binding CBMs in multimodular proteins from our model bacterium Christiangramia forsetii KT0803T, hereby unveiling the novel laminarin-binding CBM families CBMxx and CBMyy (official CAZy numbering will be provided upon acceptance of the manuscript in a peer-reviewed journal). We discovered four CBMxx repeats in a surface glycan-binding protein (SGBP) and a single CBMyy combined with a glycoside hydrolase module from family 16 (GH16_3). Our analyses revealed that both modular proteins have an elongated shape, and that the GH16_3 displayed a higher flexibility than the SGBP. While motility of both polypeptide chains may facilitate recognition and/or degradation of laminarin, constraints in the SGBP may support docking of laminarin onto the bacterial surface. The exploration of bacterial metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from phytoplankton blooms in the North Sea revealed that both laminarin-binding CBM families are widely distributed among marine Bacteroidota, illustrating the high adaptability of modularity in sugar-binding and -degrading proteins. High expression of CBMxx- and CBMyy-containing proteins during phytoplankton blooms further underpins their importance in marine laminarin usage.",

    "abstract": "The Ras-MAPK pathway is critical to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. Its dysregulation is implicated in the onset and progression of numerous types of cancers. To be active, Ras proteins are membrane anchored and organized into nanoclusters, which realize high-fidelity signal transmission across the plasma membrane. Nanoclusters therefore represent potential drug targets. However, targetable protein components of signalling nanoclusters are poorly established.\n\nWe previously proposed that the nanocluster scaffold galectin-1 (Gal1) enhances H-Ras nanoclustering by stabilizing stacked dimers of H-Ras and Raf via a direct interaction of dimeric Gal1 with the Ras binding domain (RBD) in particular of B-Raf. Here, we provide further supportive evidence for this model. We establish that the B-Raf preference emerges from divergent regions of the Raf RBDs that were proposed to interact with Gal1. We then identify the L5UR peptide, which disrupts this interaction by binding with low micromolar affinity to the B-Raf-RBD. Its 23-mer core fragment is thus sufficient to interfere with Gal1-enhanced H-Ras nanocluster, reduce MAPK-output and cell viability in HRAS-mutant cancer cell lines.\n\nOur data therefore suggest that the interface between Gal1 and the RBD of B-Raf can be targeted to disrupt Gal1-enhanced H-Ras nanoclustering.

    "abstract": "Although the bacterial flagella of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica are distributed around the cell body, many bacteria instead place their flagella at their poles. This widespread form of flagellar motility is relatively poorly understood, but these polar flagellar motors invariably feature periplasmic disk structures of unknown function. The flagellar motor of Campylobacter jejuni features a 100 nm-wide periplasmic disk associated with scaffolding a wider ring of motor proteins to increase torque, but the size of this disk is excessive for a role solely in scaffolding motor proteins. Here we show that the basal disk in C. jejuni is a flange that braces the motor during disentanglement of the flagellar filament from interactions with the cell body and other filaments, interactions that are otherwise important for host colonization. Our results reveal an entanglement of co-dependencies in the evolution of flagellar motor structure and cell plan in the Campylobacterota (previously epsilonproteobacteria). Note that this manuscript has a sibling manuscript titled Molecular model of a bacterial flagellar motor in situ reveals a \"parts-list\" of protein adaptations to increase torque that describes a molecular model of the Campylobacter jejuni flagellar motor discussed here.",

    "abstract": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) contributes to [~]1% of all human cancers including several B-cell neoplasms. A characteristic feature of EBV life cycle is its ability to transform metabolically quiescent B-lymphocytes into hyperproliferating B-cell blasts with the establishment of viral latency, while intermittent lytic cycle induction is necessary for the production of progeny virus. Our RNA-Seq analyses of both latently infected naive B-lymphocytes and transformed B-lymphocytes upon lytic cycle replication indicate a contrasting expression pattern of a membrane-associated carbonic anhydrase isoform CA9, an essential component for maintaining cell acid-base homeostasis. We show that while CA9 expression is transcriptionally activated during latent infection model, lytic cycle replication restrains its expression. Pharmacological inhibition of CA-activity using specific inhibitors retards EBV induced B-cell transformation, inhibits B-cells outgrowth and colony formation ability of transformed B-lymphocytes through lowering the intracellular pH, induction of cell apoptosis and facilitating degradation of CA9 transcripts. Reanalyses of ChIP-Seq data along with utilization of EBNA2 knockout virus and sh-RNA mediated knockdown of CA9 expression we further demonstrate that EBNA2 mediated CA9 transcriptional activation is essential for EBV latently infected B-cell survival. In contrast, during lytic cycle reactivation CA9 expression is transcriptionally suppressed by the key EBV lytic cycle transactivator, BZLF1 through its transactivation domain. Overall, our study highlights the dynamic alterations of CA9 expression and its activity in regulating pH homeostasis act as one of the major drivers for EBV induced B-cell transformation and subsequent B-cell lymphomagenesis.",

    "abstract": "Myocardin-related transcription factors (MRTFs) are coactivators of serum response factor (SRF), and thereby regulate cytoskeletal gene expression in response to actin dynamics. MRTFs have also been implicated in heat shock protein (hsp) transcription in fly ovaries, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that in mammalian cells, MRTFs are dispensable for hsp gene induction. However, the widely used small molecule inhibitors of MRTF/SRF transcription pathway, derived from CCG-1423, efficiently inhibit hsp gene transcription in both fly and mammalian cells also in absence of MRTFs. Quantifying RNA synthesis and RNA polymerase distribution demonstrates that CCG-1423-derived compounds have a genome-wide effect on transcription. Indeed, tracking nascent transcription at nucleotide resolution reveals that CCG-1423-derived compounds reduce RNA polymerase II elongation, and severely dampen the transcriptional response to heat shock. The effects of CCG-1423-derived compounds therefore extend beyond the MRTF/SRF pathway into nascent transcription, opening novel opportunities for their use in transcription research.",

    "abstract": "In cellular biology, the extrusion of large molecular complexes from the nucleus has consistently represented a considerable challenge. In this investigation, we reveal a hitherto unexplored mechanism facilitating the efflux of nuclear lipid droplets (nLDs) from the nucleus directly into the cytoplasm, a process integral to comprehending cellular processes and nuclear dynamics. Through high-throughput sequencing, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence experimentation, we demonstrated that the type I nucleoplasmic reticulum engages with nLDs, enabling the dynamic protein Rab8as transfer to the nLDs and fostering their translocation to the nuclear membrane. Phosphorylation of LMNA/C at the S392 site, adjacent to the nLD-nuclear membrane contact site, induces local depolymerization of lamins, creating an aperture that enables gradual nuclear exit of nLDs. Following this, nLDs, carrying DNA fragments, are released into the cytoplasm through budding and subsequently undergo autophagy-mediated degradation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RhoA-PKC signaling enhances nLD movement and LMNA/C phosphorylation, while its inhibition impedes nuclear nLD efflux. Our groundbreaking investigation illuminates non-nuclear pore-dependent mechanisms of material exchange and offers fresh perspectives on nuclear metabolic pathways.\n\nIn Brief\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=197 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/556761v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (107K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@38a213org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1898caorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d7270forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14582a2_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG In this study, Jin et al. elucidate a novel mechanism for the expulsion of nuclear lipid droplets (nLDs) from the nucleus. They demonstrate that the activation of RhoA within the nucleus recruits Rab8a to the surface of nLDs. Concurrently, PKC phosphorylation triggers the phosphorylation of LMNA/C at the S392 site, leading to a localized depolymerization of lamins. This creates an aperture that allows for the gradual exit of nLDs from the nucleus. The efflux process of nLDs involves three sequential steps: rupture of the nuclear fibril layer, fusion of nLDs with the inner nuclear membrane (INM), and subsequent fusion with the outer nuclear membrane (ONM). This enables nLDs to enter the cytoplasm, shedding light on a previously unknown process of large molecular entity expulsion from the nucleus.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies indicate that genomic loci harboring G-quadruplexes (G4s)--stacked structures that can form in single-stranded DNA--can be linked to epigenetic instability. However, the role of chromatin redistribution and the genome-wide nature of this process need further investigation. Here, we provide experimental evidence that connects G4s to alterations in the deposition of chromatin proteins. We have used metabolic labelling and immunoprecipitation of new and parental proteins in hRPE-1 cells to investigate global chromatin deposition dynamics.\n\nWe identify a reciprocal, local bias in chromatin protein deposition at G4 sites favoring the association of parental proteins with the G4 and new proteins with the C4 DNA strand. The deposition bias at G4 sites does not depend on replication directionality and is strengthened by G4 stabilization. Slowing down replication forks upon hydroxyurea treatment reverses the bias, supposedly affected by decoupling between helicase and polymerase. Interestingly, upon combined G4 stabilization and slowing of the replication forks, new proteins exhibit a redistribution pattern similar to G4 stabilization alone, while parental protein redistribution more resembles one after hydroxyurea treatment, hinting at mechanistic differences between parental and new histone distribution. We also report that the genomic distribution of putative quadruplexes is not random and depends on loop size, where G4s with shorter loops have a preference for the DNA strand replicated by leading and G4s with longer loops by lagging strand replication. These findings provide insight into the mechanisms behind G4 occurrence and its role in epigenetic instability and help to improve our understanding of the factors influencing biases in global chromatin protein redeposition.",

    "abstract": "The trithorax protein ASH2L is essential for organismal and tissue development. As a subunit of COMPASS/KMT2 complexes, ASH2L is necessary for methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4). Mono- and trimethylation at this site mark active enhancers and promoters, respectively, although the molecular relevance of H3K4 methylation is only partially understood. Due to the importance of ASH2L in all 6 COMPASS-like complexes and its long half-life, it has been difficult to define direct consequences. To overcome this limitation, we employed a PROTAC system, which allows the rapid degradation of ASH2L and addressing direct effects. Loss of ASH2L resulted in rapid inhibition of proliferation of mouse embryo fibroblasts. Shortly after ASH2L degradation, H3K4me3 decreased with its half-life revealing considerable variability between promoters. Subsequently, H3K4me1 increased at promoters and decreased at some enhancers. H3K27ac and H3K27me3, histone marks closely linked to H3K4 methylation, were affected with considerable delay. In parallel, chromatin compaction increased at promoters. Of note, nascent gene transcription was not affected early but overall RNA expression was deregulated late after ASH2L loss. Together, these findings suggest that downstream effects are ordered but relatively slow, despite the rapid loss of ASH2L and inactivation of KMT2 complexes. It appears that the systems that control gene transcription are well buffered and strong effects are only beginning to unfold after considerable delay.",

Here we describe a minicell system that enables in situ cryogenic electron microscopy imaging and single particle analysis to probe the mechanisms and evolution of an iconic molecular machine, the bacterial flagellar motor, which spins a helical propeller for bacterial propulsion. Innovations in sample preparation and imaging enabled resolutions sufficient to build an in situ molecular model of the C. jejuni flagellar motor. Our results provide unprecedented insights into the in situ context of flagellar motors, highlight origins of recruited components involved in the unusually high torque of the C. jejuni motor, identify previously unknown components, and reveal corresponding modifications of core components. We also visualise structures involved in torque generation and secretion previously recalcitrant to structure determination.

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial heteroresistance describes the phenomenon of antimicrobial resistance in only a subpopulation of a bacterial culture. It is usually believed to represent a selectively advantageous strategy promoting bacterial adaptation. Heteroresistance is common in human pathogens, yet often missed during diagnosis, potentially leading to treatment failures. To date, the exact characteristics and evolutionary benefits of heteroresistance are unexplored for most pathogens, including the high-risk pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Here, we systematically studied heteroresistance for a representative P. aeruginosa strain panel, including genomically distinct clinical and non-clinical isolates. We combined heteroresistance tests, over 2,500 evolution experiments, whole genome sequencing, and mathematical modelling and discovered: (i) an unexpected diversity of heteroresistance profiles across the strain panel, (ii) a high prevalence of beta-lactam, especially carbapenem heteroresistance, (iii) a clear fitness benefit of heteroresistance in treatments with continuously high antimicrobial concentrations, but (iv) no evolutionary advantages of heteroresistance in alternative regimens with initially below-MIC drug doses. We further demonstrate that fast switches between antimicrobials (i.e., fast sequential therapy) can constrain heteroresistance-promoted adaptation. We conclude that heteroresistance is not universally beneficial but only provides an evolutionary advantage under specific conditions, thereby pointing to treatment strategies that remain effective in the face of phenotypic resistance variation.",

    "abstract": "Benzo[a]pyrene, a notorious DNA-damaging carcinogen, belongs to the family of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons commonly found in tobacco smoke. Surprisingly, nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery exhibits inefficiency in recognising specific bulky DNA adducts including Benzo[a]pyrene Diol-Epoxide (BPDE), a Benzo[a]pyrene metabolite. While sequence context is emerging as the leading factor linking the inadequate NER response to BPDE adducts, the precise structural attributes governing these disparities remain inadequately understood. We therefore combined the domains of molecular dynamics and machine learning to conduct a comprehensive assessment of helical distortion caused by BPDE-Guanine adducts in multiple gene contexts. Specifically, we implemented a dual approach involving a random forest classification-based analysis and subsequent feature selection to identify precise topological features that may distinguish adduct sites of variable repair capacity. Our models were trained using helical data extracted from duplexes representing both BPDE hotspot and non-hotspot sites within the TP53 gene, then applied to sites within TP53, cII, and lacZ genes.\n\nWe show our optimised model consistently achieved exceptional performance, with accuracy, precision, and f1 scores exceeding 91%. Our feature selection approach uncovered that discernible variance in regional base pair rotation played a pivotal role in informing the decisions of our model. Notably, these disparities were highly conserved among TP53 and lacZ duplexes and appeared to be influenced by the regional GC content. As such, our findings suggest that there are indeed conserved topological features distinguishing hotspots and non-hotpot sites, highlighting regional GC content as a potential biomarker for mutation.\n\nAuthor SummaryAlthough much is known about DNA repair processes, we are still lacking some fundamental understanding relating to DNA sequence and mutation rates, specifically why some sequences mutate at a higher rate or are repaired less than others. We believe that by using a combination of Molecular Simulation and Machine Learning (ML) we can measure which structural features are present in sequences which mutate at higher rates in cancer gene and lab-based test assays frequently used to investigate toxicology.\n\nHere we have run Molecular Dynamics on five sets of DNA sequences with and without a carcinogen found in cigarette smoke to allow us to study the mutation event that would need to be repaired. We have measured their helical and base stacking properties. We have used ML to successfully differentiate between low and high mutating sequences using this model allowing us to begin to elucidate the structural features these groups have in common.\n\nWe believe this method could have wide reaching uses, it could be applied to any gene context and mutation event and indeed the knowledge of the structural features which are best repaired gives us insight into the biophysics of DNA repair adding knowledge to the drug design pipeline.",

    "abstract": "The membrane protein Niemann-Pick Type C1 protein (NPC1, named NCR1 in yeast) is central to sterol homeostasis in eukaryotes. Saccharomyces cerevisiae NCR1 is localized to the vacuolar membrane, where it is suggested to carry sterols across the protective glycocalyx and deposit them into the vacuolar membrane. However, documentation of a vacuolar glycocalyx in fungi is lacking and the mechanism for sterol translocation has remained unclear. Here we provide evidence that a glycocalyx is indeed present inside isolated Saccharomyces cerevisiae vacuoles, and report four cryo-EM structures of NCR1 in two distinct conformations that elucidate how it moves sterol through the glycocalyx. The two conformations, named \"tense\" and \"relaxed\", illustrate movement of sterol through a tunnel formed by the luminal domains. Based on these structures and on comparison with other members of the Resistance-Nodulation-Division (RND) superfamily we propose a transport model that links changes in the luminal domains with a cycle of protonation and deprotonation within the transmembrane region of the protein. Our model suggests that NPC proteins work by a generalized RND mechanism where the transmembrane domains form a motor-unit that sequentially adopts a tense and relaxed conformation to drive changes in luminal/extracellular domains.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTNiemann-Pick Type C1 (NPC1, named NCR1 in yeast) proteins play a critical role in sterol homeostasis by facilitating the integration of sterols into membranes of acidic organelles like lysosomes and vacuoles. The inner surface of these organelles membranes is shielded by the glycocalyx. Here, we provide evidence that a glycocalyx is present in vacuoles from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and demonstrate that NCR1 transports sterols across it by undergoing conformational changes. Our structures suggest a transport model where sterol transport is linked to proton-driven changes in the transmembrane region. This work sheds light on the mechanism of NPC1 protein function and has broad implications for understanding lysosomal storage disorders and for mechanisms employed by members of the Resistance-Nodulation-Division (RND) superfamily.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, a few asparaginyl endopeptidases (AEPs) from certain higher plants have been identified as efficient peptide ligases with wide applications in protein labeling and cyclic peptide synthesis. Recently, we developed a NanoLuc Binary Technology (NanoBiT)-based peptide ligase activity assay to identify more AEP-type peptide ligases. Herein, we screened 61 bamboo species from 16 genera using this assay and detected AEP-type peptide ligase activity in the crude extract of all tested bamboo leaves. From a popular bamboo species, Bambusa multiplex, we identified a full-length AEP-type peptide ligase candidate (BmAEP1) via transcriptomic sequencing. After its zymogen was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and self-activated in vitro, BmAEP1 displayed high peptide ligase activity, but with considerable hydrolysis activity. After site-directed mutagenesis of its ligase activity determinants, the mutant zymogen of [G238V]BmAEP1 was normally overexpressed in E. coli, but failed to activate itself. To solve this problem, we developed a novel protease-assisted activation approach in which trypsin was used to cleave the mutant zymogen and was then conveniently removed via an ion-exchange chromatography. After the non-covalently bound cap domain was dissociated from the catalytic core domain under acidic conditions, the recombinant [G238V]BmAEP1 displayed high peptide ligase activity with much lower hydrolysis activity, and could efficiently catalyze inter-molecular protein ligation and intra-molecular peptide cyclization. Thus, the engineered bamboo-derived peptide ligase represents a novel tool for protein labeling and cyclic peptide synthesis.",

Delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS) is a rate-limiting enzyme in proline synthesis, catalyzing the initial two-step conversion from glutamate to proline. Here, we determine the first structure of plant P5CS. Our results show that Arabidopsis thaliana P5CS2 (atP5CS2) can form enzymatic filaments in a substrate-sensitive manner. The destruction of atP5CS filaments by mutagenesis leads to a significant reduction in enzymatic activity. Furthermore, separate activity tests on two domains reveals that filament-based substrate channeling is essential for maintaining the high catalytic efficiency of atP5CS. Our study demonstrates the unique mechanism for the efficient catalysis of P5CS, shedding light on the intricate mechanisms underlying plant proline metabolism and stress response. Therefore these findings provide potential avenues for crop genetically modified breeding.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogels have emerged as an important field of study in biomedical engineering, biomaterials research and soft tissue modeling due to their versatility and customizable structures. They are three-dimensional networks capable of absorbing significant amounts of water and can be chemically or physically bonded, rendering them insoluble. The unique properties of hydrogels, such as excellent biocompatibility, degradation abilities, and ability to form chemical bonds between macromolecules, make them valuable in a variety of applications. One of the main applications of hydrogels is tissue engineering, where they are used in implantation, surgical procedures, targeted drug delivery and tissue regeneration. Hydrogels can act as scaffolds to mimic the properties of natural tissues, including mechanical strength, degradation properties, gel transformation, and swelling. Crosslinking hydrogels with other polymers, both natural and synthetic, allows their degradation rate to be controlled. Composite hydrogels or biohybrid gels offer advantages such as consistent properties between batches and a high degree of control in the manufacturing process. Using different types of polymers, researchers can fine-tune the chemical and physical properties of the resulting hydrogel, which is crucial for certain biomedical applications such as drug delivery, biocompatibility, and mechanical stability. In this study, our aim is to make hybrid hydrogel scaffolds more suitable for biomedical applications, which can show the healing effect of adding natural polymers to the scaffold structure. Our results revealed that the hybrid hydrogel obtained by chemically linking gelatin polymer chains to PEG polymers during crosslinking via UV light provides more advantageous properties in the final hydrogel structure, such as better durability and pore sizes for future cell placement in tissue engineering applications.",

    "abstract": "As reported previously, exosomes have significant impacts on the physiological and pathological state in vivo. Exosomes have been extensively studied as a drug delivery carrier and some exosomes drugs have been undergoing clinical research. The mechanisms of exosome production, transport, and secretion remain to be studied in depth. Thus, here, we developed a novel CRISPR-UMI-based gene screening system, with which we can reveal the exosomes biogenesis, transport, and uptake mechanisms on a genome-wide scale. This system consists of two parts: one is a gene knockout component; the other part is a unique molecular identifiers (UMI) labeling component that can label the exosomes produced by the knockout cells, in which each sgRNA corresponds to a specific UMI. In this way, by detecting the UMI loaded in the exosomes, we can trace the knockout gene. In this study, we first verified the function of each component using plasmids and lentiviruses respectively. Next, we simulated the infection of cells with lentiviral libraries using a single lentivirus to validate the functionality of the screening system. Finally, we constructed a CRISPR-UMI-based library targeting 15 genes (genes with clear effects on exosomes biogenesis) to further validate the reliability of the screening system. The development of this screening system is of indispensable importance for the in-depth study of the mechanisms of exosome production and secretion, as well as for the improvement of exosomes production and the advancement of exosomes industrialization.",

In contrast, it is now feasible to obtain high-quality complete assemblies of many bacterial genomes thanks to scalable and affordable long-read sequencing technology. To exploit this opportunity we introduce a phenotype- and alignment-free method for discovering co-selected and epistatically interacting genomic variation from genome assemblies covering both core and accessory parts of genomes. Our approach uses a compact coloured de Bruijn graph to approximate the intra-genome distances between pairs of loci for a collection of bacterial genomes to account for the impacts of linkage disequilibrium (LD). We demonstrate the versatility of our approach to efficiently identify associations between loci linked with drug resistance and adaptation to the hospital niche in the major human bacterial pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive laboratory evolution experiments provide a controlled context in which the dynamics of selection and adaptation can be followed in real-time at the single-nucleotide level1. And yet this precision introduces hundreds of degrees-of-freedom as genetic changes accrue in parallel lineages over generations2. On short timescales, physiological constraints have been leveraged to provide a coarse-grained view of bacterial gene expression characterized by a small set of phenomenological parameters3-5. Here, we ask whether this same framework, operating at a level between genotype and fitness, informs physiological changes that occur on evolutionary timescales. Using Lenskis Ara-1 lineage adapted to growth in glucose minimal medium6, we find that the proteome is substantially remodeled over 40 000 generations. We apply our existing quantitative proteomics analysis to partition hundreds of expressed proteins into six sectors with shared metabolic function and physiological response4. To accommodate the increased growth rates in the evolved strains, expression of metabolic enzymes undergoes sector-specific adaptation to enable increased fluxes. We find that catabolic proteins adapt by increasing the total enzyme abundance, whereas anabolic and glycolytic proteins exhibit decreased free-enzyme pools. We propose that flux-dependent regulation7 and substrate saturation8 can account for the sector-specific remodeling.",

For protein-coding messenger RNAs (mRNAs), RBPs control the localization, stability, degradation, and ultimately translation of mRNAs to impact gene expression. Disruption of the vast network of mRNA-protein interactions has been implicated in many human diseases, and accordingly, targeting these interactions has surfaced as a new frontier in RNA-targeted drug discovery. To catalyze this new field, methods are needed to enable the detection and subsequent screening of mRNA-RBP interactions, particularly in live cells.

    "abstract": "The composition of the marine phytoplankton community has been shown to impact many biogeochemical processes and marine ecosystem services. A variety of methods exist to characterize phytoplankton community composition (PCC), with varying degrees of taxonomic resolution. Accordingly, the resulting PCC determinations are dependent on the method used. Here, we use surface ocean samples collected in the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans to compare high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) pigment-based PCC to four other methods: quantitative cell imaging, flow cytometry, and 16S and 18S rRNA amplicon sequencing. These methods allow characterization of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic PCC across a wide range of size classes. PCC estimates of many taxa resolved at the class level (e.g., diatoms) show strong positive correlations across methods, while other groups (e.g., dinoflagellates) are not well captured by one or more methods. Since variations in phytoplankton pigment concentrations are related to changes in optical properties, this combined dataset expands the potential scope of ocean color remote sensing by associating PCC at the genus- and species-level with group- or class-level PCC from pigments. Quantifying the strengths and limitations of pigment-based PCC methods compared to PCC assessments from amplicon sequencing, imaging, and cytometry methods is the first step toward the robust validation of remote sensing approaches to quantify PCC from space.",

    "abstract": "SummarySelf-incompatibility (SI) is an intraspecific reproductive barrier widely present in angiosperms. The SI system with the broadest occurrence in angiosperms is based on an S-RNase linked to a cluster of multiple S-locus F-box (SLF) genes found in the Solanaceae, Plantaginaceae, Rosaceae, and Rutaceae. Recent studies reveal that non-self S-RNase is degraded by the SCFSLF-mediated ubiquitin-proteasome system in a collaborative manner in Petunia, but how self-RNase functions largely remains mysterious. Here, we show that S-RNases form S-RNase condensates (SRCs) in the self-pollen tube cytoplasm through phase separation and their disruption breaks SI in self-incompatible Petunia hybrida. We further find that the pistil SI factors of a small asparagine-rich protein HT-B and thioredoxin h (Trxh) together with a reduced state of the pollen tube all promote the expansion of SRCs, which then sequester several actin binding proteins, including the actin polymerization factor PhABRACL, whose actin polymerization activity is reduced by S-RNase in vitro. Meanwhile, we find that S-RNase variants lacking condensation ability fail to recruit PhABRACL and are unable to induce actin foci formation required for the pollen tube growth inhibition. Taken together, our results demonstrate that phase separation of S- RNase promotes SI response in P. hybrida, revealing a new mode of S-RNase action.",

    "abstract": "Online Mental Health Communities (OMHCs), such as Reddit, have witnessed a surge in popularity as go-to platforms for seeking information and support in managing mental health needs. Platforms like Reddit offer immediate interactions with peers, granting users a vital space for seeking mental health assistance. However, the largely unregulated nature of these platforms introduces intricate challenges for both users and society at large. This study explores the factors that drive peer engagement within counseling threads, aiming to enhance our understanding of this critical phenomenon. We introduce BeCOPE, a novel behavior encoded Peer counseling dataset comprising over 10,118 posts and 58,279 comments sourced from 21 mental health-specific subreddits. The dataset is annotated using three major fine-grained behavior labels: (a) intent, (b) criticism, and (c) readability, along with the emotion labels. Our analysis indicates the prominence of \"self-criticism\" as the most prevalent form of criticism expressed by help-seekers, accounting for a significant 43% of interactions. Intriguingly, we observe that individuals who explicitly express their need for help are 18.01% more likely to receive assistance compared to those who present \"surveys\" or engage in \"rants.\" Furthermore, we highlight the pivotal role of well-articulated problem descriptions, showing that superior readability effectively doubles the likelihood of receiving the sought-after support. Our study emphasizes the essential role of OMHCs in offering personalized guidance and unveils behavior-driven engagement patterns.",

Recently, using high field 7T Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI), we found in vivo evidence for increases in PFC glutamate/GABA balance through adolescence into adulthood. We now extend these MRSI findings by investigating, in the same 164 10- 32-year-old participants, its correspondence with EEG aperiodic activity, an independent measure of E/I balance elucidating changes in neural activity. Results showed decreases in PFC aperiodic activity from adolescence to adulthood, that were associated with MRSI measures of glutamate/GABA balance as well as mediating the association between age and EEG aperiodic activity. Further, changes in aperiodic activity predicted performance on a working memory task, indicating a role for E/I based changes in PFC signaling mechanisms in supporting maturation of cognitive control. Taken together, these results suggest that PFC is undergoing critical period plasticity through adolescence evident in both neurotransmitter and neural function that supports cognitive development.",
