    "abstract": "The vast majority of pathogen phylogenetic studies do not consider the possibility of multiple merger events being present, where a single node of the tree leads to more than two descendent branches. These events are however likely to occur when studying a relatively small population or if there is high variability in the reproductive chances. Here we consider the problem of detecting the presence of multiple mergers in the context of dating a phylogeny, that is determining the date of each of the nodes. We use the Lambda-coalescent theory as a modelling framework and show how Bayesian inference can be efficiently performed using a Billera-Holmes-Vogtmann space embedding and a customised Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling scheme. We applied this new analysis methodology to a large number of simulated datasets to show that it is possible to infer if and when multiple merger events occurred, and that the phylogenetic dating is improved as a result of taking this information into account. We also analysed real datasets of Vibrio cholerae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis to demonstrate the relevance of our approach to real pathogen evolutionary epidemiology. We have implemented our new methodology in a R package which is freely available at https://github.com/dhelekal/MMCTime.",

    "abstract": "Septoria tritici blotch (STB), caused by the Dothideomycete fungus Zymoseptoria tritici, is of one of the most damaging diseases of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum)1 and the target of costly fungicide applications2. In line with the fungus apoplastic lifestyle, STB resistance genes isolated to date encode receptor-like kinases (RLKs) including a wall-associated kinase (Stb6) and a cysteine-rich kinase (Stb16q)3,4. Here, we used genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on a panel of 300 whole-genome shotgun-sequenced diverse wheat landraces (WatSeq consortium) to identify a 99 kb region containing six candidates for the Stb15 resistance gene. Mutagenesis and transgenesis confirmed a gene encoding an intronless G-type lectin RLK (LecRK) as Stb15. The characterisation of Stb15 exemplifies the unexpected diversity of RLKs conferring Z. tritici resistance in wheat.",

    "abstract": "Metagenomic data compression is very important as metagenomic projects are facing the challenges of larger data volumes per sample and more samples nowadays. The reference-based compression is a promising method to obtain a high compression ratio. However, existing microbial reference genome databases are not suitable to be directly used as references for compression due to their large size and redundancy, and different metagenomic cohorts often have various microbial compositions. We presented a novel pipeline that generated simplified and tailored reference genomes for large metagenomic cohorts, enabling reference-based compression for metagenomic data. We constructed customized reference genomes, ranging from 2.4 to 3.9GB, for 29 real metagenomic datasets, and evaluated their compression performance. Reference-based compression achieved an impressive compression ratio of over 20 for human whole-genome data and up to 33.8 for all samples, demonstrating a remarkably 4.5 times improvement than the standard Gzip compression. Our method provides new insights into reference-based metagenomic data compression and has a broad application potential for faster and cheaper data transfer, storage, and analysis.",

    "abstract": "Membrane progestin receptors (mPRs) are members of the progestin and adipoQ (PAQR) receptor family that are stimulated by endogenous steroids to initiate rapid intracellular signalling through a nongenomic pathway. Previously, water-soluble compounds with mPR-binding activity from the marine algae Padina arborescens were fractionated by HPLC steps. In this study, the structure of one of the major compounds in the fraction was identified as 2-hydroxypentanoic acid (2-HPA) using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy. 2-HPA showed a substantial competitive binding affinity for hmPR in the GQD-hmPR binding assay. In contrast, synthetic structural analogues of 2-HPA showed no competitive binding activity. The physiological activity of 2-HPA and its analogues was then investigated using in vitro goldfish and in vivo zebrafish oocyte maturation and ovulation assays. As with the hmPR binding assay, only 2-HPA showed inhibitory activity on oocyte maturation and ovulation of fish oocytes. Furthermore, the inhibitory activity of 2-HPA was compared between S- and R-type 2-HPA. The results showed that both types had the same level of activity. These results indicate that 2-HPA, found as a secreted compound from Padina arborescens, is a novel mPR antagonist and its chemical structure is highly restricted to show its activity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSarcomas represent an extensive group of malignant diseases affecting mesodermal tissues. Among sarcomas, the clinical management of chondrosarcomas remains a complex challenge, as high-grade tumors do not respond to current therapies. Mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2 genes are among the most common mutations detected in chondrosarcomas and may represent a therapeutic opportunity. The presence of mutated IDH (mIDH) enzymes results in the accumulation of the oncometabolite 2-HG leading to molecular alterations that contribute to drive tumor growth.\n\nMethodsWe developed a personalized medicine strategy based on the targeted NGS/Sanger sequencing of sarcoma samples (n=6) and the use of matched patient-derived cell lines as a drug-testing platform. The anti-tumor potential of IDH mutations found in two chondrosarcoma cases was analyzed in vitro, in vivo and molecularly (transcriptomic and DNA methylation analyses).\n\nFindingsWe treated several chondrosarcoma models with specific mIDH1/2 inhibitors. Among these treatments, only the mIDH2 inhibitor enasidenib was able to decrease 2-HG levels and efficiently reduce the viability of mIDH2 chondrosarcoma cells. Importantly, oral administration of enasidenib in xenografted mice resulted in a complete abrogation of tumor growth. Enasidenib induced a profound remodeling of the transcriptomic landscape not associated to changes in the 5mC methylation levels and its anti-tumor effects were associated with the repression of proliferative pathways such as those controlled by E2F factors.\n\nInterpretationOverall, this work provides the first preclinical evidence for the use of enasidenib to treat mIDH2 chondrosarcomas.\n\nFundingSpanish Research Agency (grants PID2019-106666RB-I00; PI20CIII/00020; DTS18CIII/00005; CB16/12/00390; CB06/07/1009; CB19/07/00057).\n\nRESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSarcomas represent an extensive group of malignant diseases affecting mesodermal tissues. The genomic nature of most sarcoma subtypes, displaying high inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity with few recurrent driver mutations in a small portion of patients, makes these tumors especially indicated for personalized treatment approaches. For optimal development of these personalized protocols and a more efficient translation to the clinic, it is necessary to create patient-derived models suitable for testing the efficiency of candidate therapies. These strategies might be especially indicated for chondrosarcomas, a subtype of bone sarcoma that is inherently resistant to current therapies.\n\nAdded value of this studyTo develop a personalized medicine strategy for sarcomas we have applied targeted sequencing protocols to detect druggable mutations in a collection of sarcomas cases with available patient-derived models. Among those potential druggable alterations detected in patient samples and avatar cell lines, we found IDH mutations in two chondrosarcomas. The presence of mutated IDH enzymes results in the accumulation of the oncometabolite 2-HG which contributes to driving tumor growth. In vitro and in vivo experiments evidenced the anti-tumor potential of the IDH mutant inhibitor enasidenib for the treatment of IDH2 mutant chondrosarcomas. Our transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses show that the mechanism of action of this drug is associated with the repression of proliferative pathways rather than with the promotion of tumor differentiation.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceThis study suggests that enasidenib may represent an efficient therapeutic alternative for mutant IDH2 chondrosarcomas. This anti-proliferative mechanism of action of this drug may be especially relevant in dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas where reversal of this phenotype is not possible. In addition, this work provides support for the use of sarcoma patient-derived lines as avatar models capable of predicting (pre)-clinical responses in personalized medicine strategies.",

    "abstract": "Transient receptor potential (TRP) and PIEZO channels are known receptors for physical stimuli such as temperature and mechanical touch in sensory nerves. Since these receptors are localized in the plasma membrane, the regulation of sensory receptor activity by plasma membrane lipids has recently attracted attention. In this study, we focused on ether phospholipids (ePLs), which are abundant in neurons, and analyzed their role in somatosensation using Drosophila as a model. Reduced warmth avoidance was observed with ePL synthesizing gene knockout or knockdown in warmth-sensitive TRPA1-expressing neurons. The temperature threshold for Drosophila TRPA1 channels significantly decreased in presence of ePLs. In addition, we found that ePLs modulate the mechanosensory behavior and activation properties of the mechanosensitive channel PIEZO. Finally, we revealed that ePLs affect physicochemical properties of the plasma membrane, such as membrane tension and lipid order, in culture cells. Our study identified ePLs as crucial regulators of multiple somatosensation modalities in Drosophila.

    "abstract": "Neuronal differentiation requires building a complex intracellular architecture, and therefore the coordinated regulation of defined sets of genes. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play a key role in this regulation. However, while their action on individual mRNAs has been explored in depth, the mechanisms used to coordinate expression of the gene programs shaping neuronal morphology are poorly understood. To address this, we analysed how the paradigmatic RBP IMP1/IGF2BP1, an essential developmental factor, selects and regulates its RNA targets during the differentiation of human neurons. We performed a combination of system-wide and molecular analyses, revealing that IMP1 developmentally transitions to and directly regulates the expression of mRNAs encoding essential regulators of the microtubule network, a key component of neuronal morphology. Furthermore, we showed that m6A methylation drives the selection of specific IMP1 mRNA targets and their protein expression during the developmental transition from neural precursors to neurons, providing a molecular principle for the onset of target selectivity",
