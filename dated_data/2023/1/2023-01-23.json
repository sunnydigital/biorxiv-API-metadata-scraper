    "abstract": "Functional loss of TDP-43, an RNA-binding protein genetically and pathologically linked to ALS and FTD, leads to inclusion of cryptic exons in hundreds of transcripts during disease. Cryptic exons can promote degradation of affected transcripts, deleteriously altering cellular function through loss-of-function mechanisms. However, the possibility of de novo protein synthesis from cryptic exon transcripts has not been explored. Here, we show that mRNA transcripts harboring cryptic exons generate de novo proteins both in TDP-43 deficient cellular models and in disease. Using coordinated transcriptomic and proteomic studies of TDP-43 depleted iPSC-derived neurons, we identified numerous peptides that mapped to cryptic exons. Cryptic exons identified in iPSC models were highly predictive of cryptic exons expressed in brains of patients with TDP-43 proteinopathy, including cryptic transcripts that generated de novo proteins. We discovered that inclusion of cryptic peptide sequences in proteins altered their interactions with other proteins, thereby likely altering their function. Finally, we showed that these de novo peptides were present in CSF from patients with ALS. The demonstration of cryptic exon translation suggests new mechanisms for ALS pathophysiology downstream of TDP-43 dysfunction and may provide a strategy for novel biomarker development.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryLoss of TDP-43 function results in the expression of de novo proteins from mis-spliced mRNA transcripts.",

    "abstract": "Recently, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell technology has revolutionized cancer immunotherapy. This strategy uses synthetic CARs to redirect T cells to specific antigens expressed on the surface of tumor cells. Despite impressive progress in the treatment of hematological malignancies with CAR T cells, scientific challenges still remain for use of CAR T cell therapy to treat solid tumors. This is mainly due to the hostile tumor microenvironment and CAR-related toxicities. As the glycans decorating the T cell surface are implicated in T cell activation, differentiation, proliferation, and in the interaction of human T cells with tumor cells, we studied the role of human T cell glycosylation in more depth by manipulating their glycome. In this context, there is in vitro evidence that {beta}-galactoside binding lectins (Galectins) can have a strong impact on the functionality of tumor-infiltrating T cells. The high-affinity poly-LacNAc N-linked galectin ligands are mainly synthesized onto the {beta}1,6-GlcNAc branch introduced by N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnTV, encoded by Mgat5). We showed that knocking out Mgat5 in CD70 targeting CAR T cells leads to lower densities of poly-LacNAc modifications on the CAR T cell surface. Most interestingly, our results indicate that MGAT5 KO CD70 CAR T cells show enhanced potency to control primary tumors and relapses.",

    "abstract": "Although intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) can express major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II), especially during intestinal inflammation, it remains unclear if antigen presentation by IECs favours pro- or anti-inflammatory CD4+ T cell responses. Using selective gene ablation of MHC II in IECs and IEC organoid cultures, we assessed the impact of MHC II expression by IECs on CD4+ T cell responses and disease outcomes in response to enteric bacterial pathogens. We found that intestinal bacterial infections elicit inflammatory cues that greatly increase expression of MHC II processing and presentation molecules in colonic IECs. Whilst IEC MHC II expression had little impact on disease severity following Citrobacter rodentium or Helicobacter hepaticus infection, using a colonic IEC organoid-CD4+ T cell co-culture system, we demonstrate that IECs can activate antigen-specific CD4+ T cells in an MHC II-dependent manner, modulating both regulatory and effector Th cell subsets. Furthermore, we assessed adoptively transferred H. hepaticus-specific CD4+ T cells during intestinal inflammation in vivo and report that IEC MHC II expression dampens pro-inflammatory effector Th cells. Our findings indicate that IECs can function as non-conventional antigen presenting cells and that IEC MHC II expression fine-tunes local effector CD4+ T cell responses during intestinal inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Age-associated DNA methylation in blood cells convey information on health status. However, the mechanisms that drive these changes in circulating cells and their relationships to gene regulation are unknown. We identified age-associated DNA methylation sites in six purified blood borne immune cell types (naive B, naive CD4+and CD8+ T cells, granulocytes, monocytes and NK cells) collected from healthy individuals interspersed over a wide age range. Of the thousand of age-associated sites, only 350 sites were differentially methylated in the same direction in all cell types and validated in an independent longitudinal cohort. Genes close to age-associated hypomethylated sites were enriched for collagen biosynthesis and complement cascade pathways, while genes close to hypermethylated sites mapped to neuronal pathways. In-silico analyses showed that in most cell types, the age-associated hypo- and hypermethylated sites were enriched for ARNT (HIF1{beta}) and REST transcription factor motifs respectively, which are both master regulators of hypoxia response. To conclude, despite spatial heterogeneity, there is a commonality in the putative regulatory role with respect to transcription factor motifs and histone modifications at and around these sites. These features suggest that DNA methylation changes in healthy aging may be adaptive responses to fluctuations of oxygen availability.",

    "abstract": "The degradation of sperm-borne mitochondria after fertilization is a conserved event. This process known as post-fertilization sperm mitophagy, ensures exclusively maternal inheritance of the mitochondria-harbored mitochondrial DNA genome. This mitochondrial degradation is in part carried out by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In mammals, ubiquitin-binding pro-autophagic receptors such as SQSTM1 and GABARAP have also been shown to contribute to sperm mitophagy. These systems work in concert to ensure the timely degradation of the sperm-borne mitochondria after fertilization. We hypothesize that other receptors, cofactors, and substrates are involved in post-fertilization mitophagy. Mass spectrometry was used in conjunction with a porcine cell-free system to identify other autophagic cofactors involved in post-fertilization sperm mitophagy. This porcine cell-free system is able to recapitulate early fertilization proteomic interactions. Altogether, 185 proteins were identified as statistically different between control and cell-free treated spermatozoa. Six of these proteins were further investigated, including MVP, PSMG2, PSMA3, FUNDC2, SAMM50, and BAG5. These proteins were phenotyped using porcine in vitro fertilization, cell imaging, proteomics, and the porcine cell-free system. The present data confirms the involvement of known mitophagy determinants in the regulation of mitochondrial inheritance and provides a master list of candidate mitophagy co-factors to validate in the future hypothesis-driven studies.",

    "abstract": "Telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes that protect the chromosome-ends from eliciting DNA repair while ensuring their complete duplication. Pot1 is a subunit of telomere capping complex that binds to the G-rich overhang and inhibits the activation of DNA damage checkpoints. In this study, we explore new functions of fission yeast Pot1 by using a pot1-1 temperature sensitive mutant. We show that pot1 inactivation impairs telomere DNA replication resulting in the accumulation of ssDNA leading to the complete loss of telomeric DNA. Recruitment of Stn1 to telomeres, an auxiliary factor of DNA lagging strand synthesis, is reduced in pot1-1 mutants and overexpression of Stn1 rescues loss of telomeres and cell viability at restrictive temperature. We propose that Pot1 plays a crucial function in telomere DNA replication by recruiting Stn1-Ten1 and Pol-primase complex to telomeres, thus promoting lagging-strand DNA synthesis at stalled replication forks.",

    "abstract": "A nucleolus is a typical membrane-less nuclear body that is formed by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of its components. A major component that drives LLPS in the nucleolus is nucleophosmin (NPM1). The oligomer formation and inter-oligomer interactions of NPM1 are suggested to cooperatively contribute to the induction of LLPS. However, the molecular mechanism of how the quality of the liquid droplets formed by NPM1 is regulated is currently not well understood. In this manuscript, we revealed the regulatory mechanism of NPM1 oligomer formation and its relationship with the ability to form liquid droplets. Molecular dynamics simulations and mutant protein analyses suggest that the acidic amino acids in the N-terminal and central disordered regions of NPM1 disturb the key interactions between monomers. We also demonstrate that mutants with attenuated oligomer stability form liquid droplets as do the wild-type; the fluidity of the formed liquid droplets was greater than that of the wild-type. These results suggest that the stability of NPM1 oligomers is a critical determinant of liquid droplet quality. Furthermore, we observed that when the net negative charges in the acidic disordered regions were increased by phosphomimetic mutations at Ser125, the NPM1 oligomer stability decreased, which increased the fluidity of the liquid droplets. Our results provide a novel mechanistic insight into how nucleolar dynamics are regulated during the cell cycle.",

The platform consists of three fundamental features, 1) data operations including collaborative data processing and analytics, 2) customizable user access management for secure dissemination of the data, and 3) interactive exploration of the data through 3rd party (e.g. shiny, dashboard etc.) applications that can be scaled using docker containers. Strict data access rules and user-specific roles are applied across the whole platform to maintain data security. Minuteman is ideal for scenarios where data security, and privileged access are critical, such as industry-academia collaborations, and multi-institution consortiums. Using single-cell transcriptomics preprocessing, analyses and visualization pipelines across labs, we showcase the utility of the Minuteman platform for biomedical data analyses.

    "abstract": "The Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway is one of the best studied signalling pathway in the budding yeast that regulates cellular responses to nutrients availability and stress. The cAMP levels and the PKA activity are also subjected to a strong negative feedback that operates either through the activity of the phosphodiesterase Pde1 and also on the amount of Ras2-GTP. We have previously made and simulated a dynamic model of the whole pathway and our results suggest the existence of stable oscillatory states that depend on the activity of the RasGEF (Cdc25) and RasGAP (Ira proteins) (Pescini et al. Biotechnol Adv 30, 99-107, 2012). Stochastic oscillations related to activity of the pathway were reported by looking at the nuclear localization of the trascription factors Msn2 and Msn4 (Gamedia-Torres et al. Curr Biol 17, 1044-9, 2007). In particular Medvedik et al. (PloS Biol 5, 2330-41, 2007) reported stable oscillations of the nuclear accumulation of Msn2 in condition of limited glucose availabiliy.\n\nWe were able to reproduce the periodic accumulation of Msn2-GFP protein in yeast cells under condition of limiting glucose, and we tried to detect also in the same condition oscillations of cAMP levels in single yeast cells. We used a specific Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) sensor based on a fusion protein between CFP-EPAC-YFP expressed in yeast cells. The FRET between CFP and YFP is controlled by cAMP concentration. This sensor allows us to monitor changes in cAMP concentrations in single yeast cell for a relative long time and a peak of cAMP was normally detected after addition of glucose to derepressed cells (Colombo et al. Biochem Biophys Res Commun 487, 594-99, 2017). Using this method we were able to detect noisy oscillations of cAMP levels in single yeast cells under condition of nutritional stress caused by limiting glucose availability (0.1%). We used Spectral analysis to discriminate between true oscillations and random noise. The oscillations were characterized by period of about 4-5 min, close to that observed for Msn2-GFP oscillations.",

This irreversible transition of rhizobia is mediated by host produced nodule-specific cysteine-rich (NCR) peptides, of which about 700 are encoded in the M. truncatula genome. Some of these NCR peptides, NCR169, NCR211 and NCR247, are essential for nitrogen-fixing symbiosis.\n\nThe analysis of bacteroid and symbiotic host cell differentiation revealed that the symbiotic phenotype of M. truncatula mutants, Mtsym19, Mtsym20 and NF-FN9363, were defective likewise in the formerly studied ncr mutants, Mtdnf4-1 and Mtdnf7-2. The incomplete differentiation of bacteroids triggered premature senescence of rhizobia in the nitrogen fixation zones of mutant nodules.\n\nMtsym19 and Mtsym20 mutants are defective in the same peptide NCR-new35 and the lack of NCR343 is responsible for the ineffective symbiosis of NF-FN9363.\n\nThe activity of NCR-new35 is significantly lower and limited to the transition zone of the nodule compared with other crucial NCRs. The fluorescent protein-tagged version of NCR343 and NCR-new35 localize to the symbiotic compartment.

In this work we reveal that MAPK/MAK/MRK overlapping kinase (MOK), with unknown physiological substrate, displays an immune function by controlling inflammatory and type-I IFN responses in microglia which are detrimental to primary motor neurons. Moreover, we uncover the epigenetic reader bromodomain-containing protein 4 (Brd4) as the first molecule regulated by MOK, by promoting Ser492-phospho-Brd4 levels. We further demonstrate that MOK regulates Brd4 functions by supporting its binding to cytokine gene promoters, therefore enabling innate immune responses. Remarkably, we show that MOK levels are increased in ALS spinal cord, particularly in microglial cells, and that administration of a chemical MOK-inhibitor to ALS model mice is able to modulate Ser492-phospho-Brd4 levels, suppress microglial activation and modify disease course, indicating a pathophysiological role of MOK kinase in ALS and neuroinflammation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundClinically, deep brain stimulation (DBS) utilizes relatively high frequencies (>100 Hz). In preclinical models, 160 Hz stimulation of the nucleus accumbens in rodents prevents relapse of drug seeking. However, the ability of varied frequencies of accumbens DBS to attenuate drug seeking, and the neuronal subtype specificity of this effect, is unclear.\n\nMethodsThe present study examined the effect of DBS in the nucleus accumbens on neuronal plasticity and cocaine-primed reinstatement of cocaine seeking behavior in rats.\n\nResultsElectrical DBS of the accumbens shell attenuated cocaine primed reinstatement across a range of frequencies in male rats, including as low as 12 Hz. The majority of nucleus accumbens neurons are medium spiny neurons (MSNs), which can be differentiated in terms of projections and effects on cocaine-related behaviors by expression of dopamine D1 receptors (D1DRs) or D2DRs. In slice electrophysiology experiments, 12 Hz electrical stimulation evoked long term potentiation (LTP) in eYFP labeled D1DR-MSNs and D2DR-MSNs from cocaine naive male and female rats. However, in rats that self-administered cocaine and underwent extinction training, a paradigm identical to our reinstatement experiments, electrical DBS only elicited LTP in D2DR-MSNs from male rats; this effect was replicated by optical stimulation in rats expressing Cre-dependent ChR2 in D2DR-MSNs. Low-frequency optogenetic-DBS in D1DR-containing or D2DR-containing neurons attenuated cocaine-primed reinstatement of cocaine seeking in male but not female rats.\n\nConclusionsThese results suggest that administering DBS in the nucleus accumbens shell at lower frequencies effectively, but sex-specifically, suppresses cocaine craving, perhaps in part by reversing synaptic plasticity deficits selectively in D2DR-MSNs.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is characterized by three main motor symptoms: bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor. PD is also associated with diverse nonmotor symptoms that may develop in parallel or precede motor dysfunctions, ranging from autonomic system dysfunctions and impaired sensory perception to cognitive deficits and depression. Here, we examine the role of the progressive loss of dopaminergic transmission in behaviors related to the nonmotor symptoms of PD in a mouse model of the disease (the TIF-IADATCreERT2 strain). We found that in the period from 5 to 12 weeks after the induction of a gradual loss of dopaminergic neurons, mild motor symptoms became detectable, including changes in the distance between paws while standing as well as the step cadence and sequence. Male mutant mice showed no apparent changes in olfactory acuity, no anhedonia-like behaviors, and normal learning in an instrumental task; however, a pronounced increase in the number of operant responses performed was noted. Similarly, female mice with progressive dopaminergic neuron degeneration showed normal learning in the probabilistic reversal learning task and no loss of sweet-taste preference, but again, a robustly higher number of choices were performed in the task. In both males and females, the higher number of instrumental responses did not affect the accuracy or the fraction of rewarded responses. Taken together, these data reveal discrete, dopamine-dependent nonmotor symptoms that emerge in the early stages of dopaminergic neuron degeneration.",

In this study, we tested three bacteriophage strains for their Mtb-killing activities and found that two of them efficiently lysed Mtb H37Rv in 7H10 agar plates. However, only phage DS6A efficiently killed H37Rv in liquid culture and in Mtb-infected human primary macrophages. In subsequent experiments, we infected humanized mice with aerosolized H37Rv, then treated these mice with DS6A intravenously to test its in vivo efficacy. We found that DS6A treated mice showed increased body weight and improved pulmonary function relative to control mice. Furthermore, DS6A reduced Mtb load in mouse organs with greater efficacy in the spleen. These results demonstrated the feasibility of developing phage therapy as an effective therapeutic against Mtb infection.",

    "abstract": "Alternative pre-mRNA splicing is regulated by RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that activate or repress regulated splice sites. Repressive RBPs bind stably to target RNAs via multivalent interactions, which can be achieved by both homo-oligomerization and by interactions with other RBPs mediated by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Cell-specific splicing decisions commonly involve the action of widely expressed RBPs that can bind around target exons, but without effect in the absence of a key cell-specific regulator. To address how cell-specific regulators collaborate with constitutive RBPs in alternative splicing regulation we used the smooth-muscle specific regulator RBPMS. Recombinant RBPMS is sufficient to switch cell specific alternative splicing of Tpm1 exon 3 in cell free assays by remodelling ribonucleprotein complexes and preventing assembly of ATP-dependent splicing complexes. This activity depends upon its C-terminal IDR, which facilitates dynamic higher-order self-assembly, cooperative binding to multivalent RNA, and interactions with other splicing co-regulators, including MBNL1 and RBFOX2. Our data show how a cell-specific RBP can co-opt more widely expressed regulatory RBPs to facilitate cooperative assembly of stable cell-specific regulatory complexes.",

In the absence of the canonical maintenance mechanism provided by telomerase, telomere shortening induces genome instability. The landscape of the ensuing genome rearrangements is not accessible by short-read sequencing. Here, we leverage Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read sequencing to survey the extensive repertoire of genome rearrangements in telomerase mutants of the model green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. In telomerase mutant strains grown for [~]700 generations, most chromosome extremities were capped by short telomere sequences that were either recruited de novo from other loci or maintained in a telomerase-independent manner. Other extremities did not end with telomeres but only with repeated subtelomeric sequences. The subtelomeric elements, including rDNA, were massively rearranged and involved in breakage-fusion-bridge cycles, translocations, recombinations and chromosome circularization. These events were established progressively over time and displayed heterogeneity at the subpopulation level. New telomere-capped extremities composed of sequences originating from more internal genomic regions were associated with high DNA methylation, suggesting that de novo heterochromatin formation contributes to restore chromosome end stability in C. reinhardtii. The diversity of alternative strategies to maintain chromosome integrity and the variety of rearrangements found in telomerase mutants are remarkable and illustrate genome plasticity at short timescales.",

Correctly selecting the ovarian tissue with high follicle loading for freezing and reimplantation increases the likelihood of restoring ovarian function, but it is a challenging process. In this work, we explore the use of three-dimensional spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) to identify different follicular stages, especially primary follicles, compare the identifications with H&E images, and measure the size and age-related follicular density distribution differences in mice ovaries. We use the thickness of the layers of granulosa cells to differentiate primordial and primary follicles from secondary follicles. The measured dimensions and age-related follicular distribution agree well with histological images and physiological aging. Finally, we apply attenuation coefficient map analyses to significantly improve the image contrast and the contrast-to-noise ratio (p < 0.001), facilitating follicle identification and quantification. We conclude that SD-OCT is a promising method to noninvasively evaluate ovarian follicles.",

    "abstract": "In the present study we report the functional and structural characterization of 17T2, a new highly potent pan-neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 human monoclonal antibody (mAb) isolated from a convalescent COVID-19 individual infected during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. 17T2 is a class 1 VH1-58/{kappa}3-20 antibody, derived from a receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific IgA memory B cell and developed as a human recombinant IgG1. Functional characterization revealed that 17T2 mAb has a high and exceptionally broad neutralizing activity against all SARS-CoV-2 spike variants tested, including BQ.1.1. Moreover, 17T2 mAb has in vivo prophylactic activity against Omicron BA.1.1 infection in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice. 3D reconstruction from cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) showed that 17T2 binds the Omicron BA.1 spike protein with the RBD domains in \"up\" position and recognizes an epitope overlapping with the receptor binding motif, as it is the case for other structurally similar neutralizing mAbs, including S2E12. Yet, unlike S2E12, 17T2 retained its high neutralizing activity against all Omicron sublineages tested, probably due to a larger contact area with the RBD, which could confer a higher resilience to spike mutations. These results highlight the impact of small structural antibody changes on neutralizing performance and identify 17T2 mAb as a potential candidate for future therapeutic and prophylactic interventions.",

    "abstract": "MotivationUnderstanding the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for deciding on the correct treatment of this epidemic disease. Although several recent studies reported the comparative transcriptome analyses of the three coronaviridae (CoV) members; namely SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, there is yet to exist a web-tool to compare increasing number of host transcriptome response datasets against the pre-processed CoV member datasets. Therefore, we developed a web application called CompCorona, which allows users to compare their own transcriptome data of infected host cells with our pre-built datasets of the three epidemic CoVs, as well as perform functional enrichment and principal component analyses (PCA).\n\nResultsComparative analyses of the transcriptome profiles of the three CoVs revealed that numerous differentially regulated genes directly or indirectly related to several diseases (e.g., hypertension, male fertility, ALS, and epithelial dysfunction) are altered in response to CoV infections. Transcriptome similarities and differences between the host PBMC and lung tissue infected by SARS-CoV-2 are presented. Most of our findings are congruent with the clinical cases recorded in the literature. Hence, we anticipate that our results will significantly contribute to ongoing studies investigating the pre-and/or post-implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, we implemented a user-friendly public website, CompCorona for biomedical researchers to compare users own CoV-infected host transcriptome data against the built-in CoV datasets and visualize their results via interactive PCA, UpSet and Pathway plots.\n\nAvailabilityCompCorona is freely available on the web at http://compcorona.mu.edu.tr\n\nContacttugbasuzek@mu.edu.tr",

Single-cell RNA sequencing of lung cells indicates that the lack of Fzd6, which is expressed in Foxj1+ cells, increases expression of the aldo-keto reductase Akr1b8 in Foxj1+ cells. Intratracheal administration of the Akr1b8 protein phenocopies Fzd6-deficient lung phenotypes. In addition, ferroptosis inhibitors also phenocopy Fzd6-deficient lung phenotypes and exert no further effects in Fzd6-deficient lungs.

XBB.1.5 has rapidly increased in frequency and has become the dominant virus in New England.

We assessed humoral and cellular immune responses in 30 participants who received the bivalent mRNA boosters and performed assays at baseline prior to boosting, at week 3 after boosting, and at month 3 after boosting. Our data demonstrate that XBB.1.5 substantially escapes NAb responses but not T cell responses after bivalent mRNA boosting. NAb titers to XBB.1 and XBB.1.5 were similar, suggesting that the F486P mutation confers greater transmissibility but not increased immune escape.

    "abstract": "Inherited mutations in contractile and structural genes, which decrease cardiomyocyte tension generation, are principal drivers of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)- the leading cause of heart failure1,2. Progress towards developing precision therapeutics for and defining the underlying determinants of DCM has been cardiomyocyte centric with negligible attention directed towards fibroblasts despite their role in regulating the best predictor of DCM severity, cardiac fibrosis3,4. Given that failure to reverse fibrosis is a major limitation of both standard of care and first in class precision therapeutics for DCM, this study examined whether cardiac fibroblast-mediated regulation of the hearts material properties is essential for the DCM phenotype. Here we report in a mouse model of inherited DCM that prior to the onset of fibrosis and dilated myocardial remodeling both the myocardium and extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffen from switches in titin isoform expression, enhanced collagen fiber alignment, and expansion of the cardiac fibroblast population, which we blocked by genetically suppressing p38 in cardiac fibroblasts. This fibroblast-targeted intervention unexpectedly improved the primary cardiomyocyte defect in contractile function and reversed ECM and dilated myocardial remodeling. Together these findings challenge the long-standing paradigm that ECM remodeling is a secondary complication to inherited defects in cardiomyocyte contractile function and instead demonstrate cardiac fibroblasts are essential contributors to the DCM phenotype, thus suggesting DCM-specific therapeutics will require fibroblast-specific strategies.",

    "abstract": "A hallmark of many malignant tumors is dedifferentiated (immature) cells bearing slight or no resemblance to the normal cells from which the cancer originated. Tumor dedifferentiated cells exhibit a higher capacity to survive to chemo and radiotherapies and have the ability to incite tumor relapse. Inducing cancer cell differentiation would abolish their self-renewal and invasive capacity and could be combined with the current standard of care, especially in poorly differentiated and aggressive tumors (with worst prognosis). However, differentiation therapy is still in its early stages and the intrinsic complexity of solid tumor heterogeneity demands innovative approaches in order to be efficiently translated into the clinic. We demonstrate here that microRNA 203, a potent driver of differentiation in pluripotent stem cells (ESCs and iPSCs), promotes the differentiation of mammary gland tumor cells. Combining mouse in vivo approaches and both mouse and human-derived tridimensional organoid cultures, we report here that miR-203 influences the self-renewal capacity, plasticity and differentiation potential of breast cancer cells, and prevents tumor cell growth in vivo. Our work sheds light on differentiation-based antitumor therapies and offers miR-203 as a promising tool for directly confronting the tumor-maintaining and regeneration capability of cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Photosynthesis in eukaryotic cells takes place in specialised plastids. The regulation of plastid development is crucial for multicellular systems such as plants. Two families of transcription factors known as Golden2-like (GLK) and GATA regulate plant chloroplast development, and the miR171-targeted SCARECROW-LIKE (SCL) GRAS transcription factors regulate chlorophyll biosynthesis. The extent to which these proteins carry out conserved roles in non-seed plants such as the liverworts is not known. Here we determine the degree of functional conservation of the GLK, GATA and SCL proteins in controlling chloroplast development in the model liverwort Marchantia polymorpha. Our results indicate that GATA and SCL do not play a detectable role in chloroplast biogenesis but loss of GLK function leads to reduced chloroplast size, underdeveloped thylakoid membranes and lower chlorophyll accumulation. These findings suggest that the functioning of GATA and SCL in chloroplast development either evolved after the divergence of vascular plants from bryophytes, that both roles were secondarily lost in M. polymorpha, or that functional redundancy is masking their roles. In contrast, and consistent with its presence in algae, GLK plays a conserved role in chloroplast biogenesis of liverworts and vascular plants.",

Here, we reimagine Perturb-seqs design through the lens of algorithms applied to random, low-dimensional observations. We present compressed Perturb-seq, which measures multiple random perturbations per cell or multiple cells per droplet and computationally decompresses these measurements by leveraging the sparse structure of regulatory circuits. Applied to 598 genes in the immune response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide, compressed Perturb-seq achieves the same accuracy as conventional Perturb-seq at 4 to 20-fold reduced cost, with greater power to learn genetic interactions. We identify known and novel regulators of immune responses and uncover evolutionarily constrained genes with downstream targets enriched for immune disease heritability, including many missed by existing GWAS or trans-eQTL studies.

To prove generalizability, we apply compressed screening to examine transcriptional responses of patient-derived pancreatic cancer organoids to a library of tumor-microenvironment (TME)-nominated recombinant protein ligands. Using single-cell RNA-seq as a readout, we uncover reproducible phenotypic shifts induced by ligands that correlate with clinical features in larger datasets and are distinct from reference signatures available in public databases.

    "abstract": "Collision avoidance [1-4] and target pursuit [5-8] are challenging flight behaviors for any animal or autonomous vehicle, but their interaction is even more so [9-11]. For predators adapted to hunting in clutter, the demands of these two tasks may conflict, requiring effective reconciliation to avoid a hazardous collision or loss of target. Technical approaches to obstacle avoidance rely mainly on path-planning algorithms [12], but these are unlikely to be effective during closed-loop pursuit of a maneuvering target, so collision avoidance must instead be implemented reactively during prey pursuit. For example, the pursuit-avoidance behavior of predatory flies has been successfully modelled by combining feedback on target motion with feedback on obstacle looming [13]. It is unclear, however, whether this mechanism will generalize to complex environments with many looming obstacles, and it remains unknown how aerial predators reconcile the conflict between obstacle avoidance and prey pursuit in clutter. Here we use high-speed motion capture data to show how Harris hawks Parabuteo unicinctus avoid collisions by making open-loop steering corrections during closed-loop pursuit. We find that hawks combine continuous feedback on target motion with a discrete feedforward steering correction aimed at clearing an upcoming obstacle as closely as possible at maximum span. By biasing the hawks flight direction, this guidance law provides an effective means of prioritizing obstacle avoidance whilst remaining locked-on to the target. We anticipate that a similar mechanism may be used in terrestrial and aquatic pursuit. The same biased guidance law could be used for obstacle avoidance in drones designed to intercept other drones in clutter, or in drones using closed-loop guidance to navigate between fixed waypoints in urban environments.",

In mammals, complex evaluations of the environment require large numbers and different subtypes of neurons. The nematode C. elegans avoid hazardous chemicals they encounter by reversing their direction of movement. How does the worms compact nervous system processes the spatial information and directs the change of motion? We show here that a single interneuron, AVA, receives glutamatergic excitatory signals from head sensory neurons and glutamatergic inhibitory signals from the tail sensory neurons. AVA integrates the spatially distinct and opposing cues, whose output instructs the animals behavioral decision. We further find that the differential activation of AVA from the head and tail stems from distinct anatomical localization of inhibitory and excitatory glutamate-gated receptors along the AVA process, and from different threshold sensitivities of the sensory neurons to aversive stimuli. Our results thus uncover a cellular mechanism that mediates spatial computation of nociceptive cues for efficient decision-making in C. elegans.",

    "abstract": "Negative emotional bias is an essential hallmark of depression reflected by negative shift in hedonic valence assignment to emotional stimuli. Pleasant cues become less attractive and unpleasant ones more aversive. Given the crucial role of amygdala in valence coding, we hypothesize that specific basolateral amygdala (BLA) circuits alterations might support negative emotional bias associated with depressive states.\n\nUsing a translational assay, we evaluate odor valence assignment in an animal model for depression chronically administered by corticosterone (CORT). We show spontaneous negative bias in depressive-like mice that attribute more negative valences for both attractive and aversive odors, mimicking thus the bias observed in depressed bipolar patients.\n\nCombining CTB and rabies-based tracing with ex vivo measurements of neuronal activity and chemogenetics experiments, we find that the CORT treatment reduces BLA-to-nucleus accumbens (NAc) neuronal activity and increases BLA-to-central amygdala activity, circuits respectively known to be involved in positive and negative valence encoding. Alterations in presynaptic connectivity of BLA-projecting neurons accompany these activity shifts. Interestingly, inputs from the paraventricular thalamus nucleus (PVT) towards BLA-to-NAc neurons are reduced in CORT-treated mice. Finally, chemogenetically activating the BLA-to-NAc circuit attenuates the negative bias in CORT-treated mice as well as the depressive-like phenotype, similarly than Fluoxetine antidepressant treatment. Altogether, we demonstrate that depressive states are associated with negative emotional bias both in human and mice. This bias is supported by activity shifts of specific BLA circuits along with durable presynaptic connectivity changes, but it could be alleviated by antidepressant drug or activity manipulation of altered BLA circuit.",

The current positive RNA-based detection systems are unable to discriminate between replicating and non-replicating viruses, complicating decisions related to quarantine and therapeutic interventions. The proposed method targets the negative strand of the virus and has the potential to effectively distinguish between active and inactive infections, which could provide a more accurate means of determining the spread of the virus and guide more effective public health measures during the current pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Most bacteria are encased into a load-bearing rigid framework, the cell wall (CW). The peptidoglycan (PG) layer, a network composed of glycan strands cross-linked by stem peptides, is the main component of the CW. During PG synthesis, precursors are first synthetized intracellularly, before being incorporated into the existing PG meshwork by transglycosylation (TG) and transpeptidation (TP) reactions. Covalent modifications of the PG meshwork such as amidation and acetylation participate in PG homeostasis by regulating PG-associated enzymes like PG hydrolases.\n\nBecause of its essential role, PG synthesis represents a primary target for antibiotic action. Here, we investigated the effect on PG composition of antibiotics targeting intracellular and extracellular steps of PG synthesis: inhibitors of PG precursors synthesis (fosfomycin, D-cycloserine, bacitracin and tunicamycin) and TG/TP inhibitors (vancomycin and penicillin G), respectively. Our study revealed interesting correlations between crosslinking and both de-N-acetylation and amidation of the sacculus. A thorough analysis of muropeptides composition put into light an unexpected anti-correlation between the degree of PG crosslinking and accumulation of de-amidated disaccharide-tripeptide monomer subunit (M3) in the presence of TP inhibitors. We confirmed these observations by analyzing mutants of the PG synthesis pathway.",

The COVID-19 pandemic has badly affected every part of the world, and the situation in the world is getting worse with the emergence of novel variants. Our study aims to explore the genome of SARS-,CoV2 followed by in silico analysis of its proteins.\n\nMethodsDifferent nucleotide and protein variants of SARS-Cov2 were retrieved from NCBI. Contigs & consensus sequences were developed to identify variations in these variants by using SnapGene. Data of variants that significantly differ from each other was run through Predict Protein software to understand changes produced in protein structure The SOPMA web server was used to predict the secondary structure of proteins. Tertiary structure details of selected proteins were analyzed using the online web server SWISS-MODEL.\n\nFindingsSequencing results shows numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms in surface glycoprotein, nucleocapsid, ORF1a, and ORF1ab polyprotein. While envelope, membrane, ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8, and ORF10 genes have no or few SNPs. Contigs were mto identifyn of variations in Alpha & Delta Variant of SARs-CoV-2 with reference strain (Wuhan). The secondary structures of SARs-CoV-2 proteins were predicted by using sopma software & were further compared with reference strain of SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan) proteins. The tertiary structure details of only spike proteins were analyzed through the SWISS-MODEL and Ramachandran plot. By Swiss-model, a comparison of the tertiary structure model of SARS-COV-2 spike protein of Alpha & Delta Variant was made with reference strain (Wuhan). Alpha & Delta Variant of SARs-CoV-2 isolates submitted in GISAID from Pakistan with changes in structural and nonstructural proteins were compared with reference strain & 3D structure mapping of spike glycoprotein and mutations in amino acid were seen.\n\nConclusionThe surprising increased rate of SARS-CoV-2 transmission has forced numerous countries to impose a total lockdown due to an unusual occurrence. In this research, we employed in silico computational tools to analyze SARS-CoV-2 genomes worldwide to detect vital variations in structural proteins and dynamic changes in all SARS-CoV-2 proteins, mainly spike proteins, produced due to many mutations. Our analysis revealed substantial differences in functional, immunological, physicochemical, & structural variations in SARS-CoV-2 isolates. However real impact of these SNPs can only be determined further by experiments. Our results can aid in vivo and in vitro experiments in the future.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic rewiring is essential to enable cancer onset and progression. One important metabolic pathway that is often hijacked by cancer cells is the one-carbon cycle, in which the third carbon of serine is oxidized to formate. We have previously shown that formate production in cancer cells often exceeds the anabolic demand, resulting in formate overflow. Furthermore, we observed that high extracellular formate promotes the in vitro invasiveness of glioblastoma (GBM) cells. However, additional data supporting this in vitro observation and mechanistic details remained elusive so far.\n\nIn the present study, we now demonstrate that inhibition of formate overflow results in a decreased invasiveness of GBM cells ex vivo and in vivo. Additionally, we observed that exposure to exogeneous formate can induce a transiently stable pro-invasive phenotype that results in increased metastasis formation in vivo. All in all, these results suggest that a local formate increase within the tumor microenvironment may be one factor that can promote cancer cell motility and dissemination.\n\nMechanistically, we uncover a previously undescribed interplay where formate acts as a trigger to alter fatty acid metabolism and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity which in turn impacts cancer cell invasiveness. We thus highlight the role of formate as a pro-invasive metabolite. Gaining a deeper understanding of formate overflow and how it promotes invasion in cancer, may open new therapeutic opportunities to prevent cancer cell dissmination.",

    "abstract": "The role of T cell help in autoantibody responses is not well understood. Since tolerance mechanisms govern both T and B cell responses, one might predict that both T cell tolerance and B cell tolerance must be defeated in autoantibody responses requiring T cell help. To define whether autoreactive B cells depend on T cells to generate autoantibody responses, we studied the role of T cells in autoantibody responses resulting from acute cell-specific deletion of regulatory phosphatases. Ars/A1 B cells are DNA-reactive and require continuous inhibitory signaling by the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 and the inositol phosphatases SHIP-1 and PTEN to maintain unresponsiveness. Acute B cell-restricted deletion of any of these phosphatases results in an autoantibody response. Here we show that CD40-CD40L interactions are required to support autoantibody responses of B cells whose anergy has been compromised. If the B cell-intrinsic driver of loss of tolerance is failed negative regulation of PI3K signaling, bystander T cells provide sufficient CD40-mediated signal 2 to support an autoantibody response. However, while autoantibody responses driven by acute B cell-targeted deletion of SHP-1 also require T cells, bystander T cell help does not suffice. These results demonstrate that upregulation of PI3K signaling in autoreactive B cells, recapitulating the effect of multiple autoimmunity risk alleles, promotes autoantibody responses both by increasing B cells cooperation with non-cognate T cell help, as well as by altering BCR signaling. Receptiveness to bystander T cell help enables autoreactive B cells to circumvent the fail-safe of T cell tolerance.\n\nSignificancePhosphatase suppression of PI3K signaling is an important mechanism by which peripheral autoreactive B cells are kept in an unresponsive/anergic state. Loss of this suppression, due to genetic alleles that confer risk of autoimmunity, often occurs in autoreactive B cells of individuals who develop autoimmune disease. Here we demonstrate that de-repression of PI3K signaling promotes autoantibody responses of a DNA-reactive B cell clone by relaxing dependence of autoantibody responses on T cell-derived helper signals. These results suggest that impaired regulation of PI3K signaling can promote autoantibody responses in two ways: by restoring antigen receptor signaling and by enabling autoreactive B cells to circumvent restrictions imposed by T cell tolerance mechanisms.",

Nursery habitats, which disproportionately contribute individuals to the adult segment of populations, are essential to blue crab population dynamics. Spartina alterniflora salt marshes are productive but fragmented intertidal nursery habitats which may serve as a refuge from predation for juvenile blue crabs. However, the effects of various characteristics of salt marshes on nursery metrics, such as survival, have not been quantified. Using mesocosm experiments, we examined the effects of shoot density and water depth on juvenile blue crab survival using adult blue crabs as predators. Survival increased significantly with shoot density, whereas water depth did not affect survival. Thus, in contrast to several previous studies, water depth did not influence survival of juvenile blue crabs, possibly due to different environmental conditions from prior studies. These findings indicate that salt marsh structural complexity enhances juvenile survival, and that the beneficial effect of shallow water on juvenile survival differs by environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "Infections are a significant risk to patients who receive medical implants, and can often lead to implant failure, tissue necrosis, and even amputation. So far, although various surface modification approaches have been proposed for prevention and treatment of microbial biofilms on indwelling medical devices, most are too expensive/complicated to fabricate, unscalable, or limited in durability for clinical use. Here we present a new bottom-up design for fabricating scalable and durable nano-pattered coatings with dynamic topography for long-term antibacterial effects. We show that MXene layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembled coatings -- with finely tunable crumple structures with nanometer resolution and excellent mechanical durability -- can be successfully fabricated on stretchable poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). The crumpled MXene coating with sharp-edged peaks shows potent antibacterial effects against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. In addition, we find that on-demand dynamic deformation of the crumpled coating can remove [&ge;]99% of adhered bacterial cells for both species, resulting in a clean surface with restored functionality. This approach offers improved practicality, scalability, and antibacterial durability over previous methods, and its flexibility may lend itself to many types of biomaterials and implantable devices.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial tRNA guanine transglycosylases (TGTs) catalyze the exchange of guanine for the 7-deazaguanine queuine precursor, prequeuosine1 (preQ1). While the native nucleic acid substrate for bacterial TGTs is the anticodon loop of queuine-cognate tRNAs, the minimum recognition sequence for the enzyme is a structured hairpin containing the target G nucleobase in a \"UGU\" loop motif. Previous work has established an RNA modification system, RNA-TAG, in which E. coli TGT exchanges the target G on an RNA of interest for chemically modified preQ1 substrates linked to a small molecule reporter such as biotin or a fluorophore. While extending the substrate scope of RNA transglycosylases to include DNA would enable numerous applications, it has been previously reported that TGT is incapable of modifying native DNA. Here we demonstrate that TGT can in fact recognize and label specific DNA substrates. Through iterative testing of rationally mutated DNA hairpin sequences, we determined the minimal sequence requirements for transglycosylation of unmodified DNA by E. coli TGT. Controlling steric constraint in the DNA hairpin dramatically affects labeling efficiency, and, when optimized, can lead to near quantitative site-specific modification. We demonstrate the utility of our newly developed DNA-TAG system by rapidly synthesizing probes for fluorescent Northern blotting of spliceosomal U6 RNA and RNA FISH visualization of the long noncoding RNA, MALAT1. The ease and convenience of the DNA-TAG system will provide researchers with a tool for accessing a wide variety of affordable modified DNA substrates.",

    "abstract": "SO_SCPLOWUMMARYC_SCPLOWDue to the link between microglial morphology and function, morphological changes in microglia are frequently used to identify pathological immune responses in the central nervous system. In the absence of pathology, microglia are responsible for maintaining homeostasis, and their morphology can be indicative of how the healthy brain behaves in the presence of external stimuli and genetic differences. Despite recent interest in high throughput methods for morphological analysis, Sholl analysis is still the gold standard for quantifying microglia morphology via imaging data. Often, the raw data are naturally hierarchical, minimally including many cells per image and many images per animal. However, existing methods for performing downstream inference on Sholl data rely on truncating this hierarchy so rudimentary statistical testing procedures can be used. To fill this longstanding gap, we introduce a fully parametric model-based approach for analyzing Sholl data. We generalize our model to a hierarchical Bayesian framework so that inference can be performed without aggressive reduction of otherwise very rich data. We apply our model to three real data examples and perform simulation studies comparing the proposed method with a popular alternative.",

Neuropathologically, ALS is defined by severe loss of upper and lower motor neurons with a robust neuroinflammatory response.

These drugs were tested in two models models that reproduce aspects of ALS. We conducted a 14 week dosing study of these two drugs in the SOD1G93A and Prp-TDP43A315T models of ALS. The drugs were given once daily for two weeks and then every other day for 6 weeks for a total of 8 weeks of treatment. Outcome measurements included efficacy assessment on the neuromuscular phenotypes, and pathological analyses of ubiquitin load and neuro-inflammatory markers in spinal motor neurons. Neither of these drug treatments produced significant extensions in survival; however, there were changes in ubiquitin load in SOD1G93A mice that suggest the drugs could be beneficial as additions to other therapies.",

    "abstract": "Lymphocyte development consists of sequential and mutually exclusive cell states of proliferative selection and antigen receptor gene recombination1. Transitions between each state require large, coordinated changes in epigenetic landscapes and transcriptional programs2,3. How this occurs remains unclear. Herein, we demonstrate that in small pre-B cells, the lineage and stagespecific epigenetic reader Bromodomain and WD Repeating Containing Protein 1 (BRWD1)2,4 reorders three-dimensional chromatin topology to affect transition between proliferative and gene recombination molecular programs. BRWD1 regulated the switch between poised and active enhancers interacting with promoters and coordinated this with Igk locus contraction. BRWD1 did so by converting chromatin-bound static cohesin to dynamic complexes competent to mediate long-range looping. Remarkably, ATP depletion recapitulated cohesin distributions observed in Brwd1-/- cells. Therefore, in small pre-B cells, cohesin conversion is the main energetic mechanism dictating where dynamic looping occurs in the genome. Our findings provide a new mechanism of cohesin regulation and reveal how cohesin function can be dictated by lineage contextual mechanisms to facilitate specific cell fate transitions.",

    "abstract": "The spermosphere is the transient, immediate zone of soil around imbibing and germinating seeds. It represents a habitat where there is contact between seed-associated microbes and soil microbes, but is studied less compared to other plant habitats. Previous studies on spermosphere microbiology were primarily culture-based or did not sample the spermosphere soil as initially defined in space and time. Thus, the objectives of this study were to develop an efficient strategy to collect spermosphere soils around imbibing soybean and cotton in non-sterile soil and investigate changes in microbial communities. The method employed sufficiently collected spermosphere soil as initially defined in space by constraining the soil sampled with a cork borer and confining the soil to a 12-well microtiter plate. Spermosphere prokaryote composition changed over time and depended on the crop within six hours after seeds were sown. By 12 to 18 hours, crops had unique microbial communities in spermosphere soils. Prokaryote evenness dropped following seed imbibition with the proliferation of copiotrophic soil bacteria. Due to their long history of plant growth promotion, prokaryote OTUs in Bacillus, Paenibacillus, Burkholderia, Massilia, Azospirillum, and Pseudomonas were notable genera enriched. Fungi and prokaryotes were hub taxa in cotton and soybean spermosphere networks. Additionally, the enriched taxa were not hubs in networks, suggesting other taxa besides those enriched may be important for spermosphere communities. Overall, this study advances knowledge in the assembly of the plant microbiome early in a plants life, which may have plant health implications in more mature plant growth stages.",

We examined metabolic interactions within the evolutionary ancient symbiosis between the honey bee (Apis mellifera) and the core gut microbiota member Snodgrassella alvi. This Betaproteobacteria is incapable of metabolizing saccharides, yet colonizes the honey bee gut in the presence of only a sugar diet. Using comparative metabolomics, 13C tracers, and Nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS), we show in vivo that S. alvi grows on host-derived organic acids, including citrate, glycerate and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate which are actively secreted by the host into the gut lumen. S. alvi additionally modulates tryptophan metabolism in the gut by converting kynurenine to anthranilate. These results suggest that S. alvi is adapted to a specific metabolic niche in the gut that depends on host-derived nutritional resources.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSilver possesses cytotoxic properties against many microorganisms and is regularly used in wound care. Current evidence supporting the use of one type of silver-containing wound dressing (SCWD) is insufficient.\n\nMethodsTo examine the ability of selected SCWDs to inhibit the growth of two strains of bacteria (E. coli and S. aureus) commonly found in wounds, an in vitro wound model was used. Bacteria were applied to the surface of nutrient agar and a piece of each SCWD was applied to the bacteria. The plates were incubated at 37{degrees}C overnight. The zone of inhibition (ZI) around each SCWD was measured in cm2.\n\nResultsThe mean ZI for Acticoat Flex-3 on E. coli was 1.59 {+/-} 0.15 cm2, which was significantly greater than that observed for Aquacel Ag (p<0.001), Mepilex Ag (p<0.0001), Mepitel Ag (p<0.001), Optifoam (p<0.0001) and Tegaderm Alginate Ag (p<0.01), but statistically indistinguishable from Maxorb II Ag.

Herein we show that Acticoat Flex-3 may provide the most wound protection against bacterial infection. In conclusion, these data provide clinicians with additional independent evidence to inform their clinical practice on the use of specific wound dressings.\n\nPRECISThe antimicrobial properties of Acticoat Flex-3, a dressing composed of nanocrystalline silver layer of knitted polyester, outperformed other silver-containing dressings against E. coli and S. aureus.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) of Plasmodium malaria parasites is a major antimalarial drug target, but critical cytochrome functions remain unstudied and enigmatic. Parasites express two distinct cyt c homologs (c and c-2) with unusually sparse sequence identity and uncertain fitness contributions. P. falciparum cyt c-2 is the most divergent eukaryotic cyt c homolog currently known and has sequence features predicted to be incompatible with canonical ETC function. We tagged both cyt c homologs and the related cyt c1 for inducible knockdown. Translational repression of cyt c and cyt c1 was lethal to parasites, which died from ETC dysfunction and impaired ubiquinone recycling. In contrast, cyt c-2 knockdown or knock-out had little impact on blood-stage growth, indicating that parasites rely fully on the more conserved cyt c for ETC function. Biochemical and structural studies revealed that both cyt c and c-2 are hemylated by holocytochrome c synthase, but UV-vis absorbance and EPR spectra strongly suggest that cyt c-2 has an unusually open active site in which heme is stably coordinated by only a single axial amino-acid ligand and can bind exogenous small molecules. These studies provide a direct dissection of cytochrome functions in the ETC of malaria parasites and identify a highly divergent Plasmodium cytochrome c with molecular adaptations that defy a conserved role in eukaryotic evolution.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTMitochondria are critical organelles in eukaryotic cells that drive oxidative metabolism. The mitochondrion of Plasmodium malaria parasites is a major drug target that has many differences from human cells and remains poorly studied. One key difference from humans is that malaria parasites express two cytochrome c proteins that differ significantly from each other and play untested and uncertain roles in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). Our study revealed that one cyt c is essential for ETC function and parasite viability while the second, more divergent protein has unusual structural and biochemical properties and is not required for growth of blood-stage parasites. This work elucidates key biochemical properties and evolutionary differences in the mitochondrial ETC of malaria parasites.",

    "abstract": "Biosurfactants are amphiphilic compounds of microbial origin with a wide range of industrial applications. Rhamnolipids (RLs) offer a broad range of potential applications as biosurfactants in industry and agriculture. Several studies report a high capacity for controlling different plant pests and pathogens and consider RLs as promising candidates for bio-based plant protection agents. RLs are a class of glycolipids consisting of one (mRLs) or two (dRLs) rhamnose moieties linked to a single or branched {beta}-fatty acid. Due to the diversity of RLs, so far little is known about the relation between molecular structure and biological activity.\n\nEngineering the synthesis pathway allowed us to differentiate between the activities of mixtures of pure mRL and of pure dRL congeners and elaborated HPLC techniques further enabled to analyse the activity of single congeners. In a model system with the plant Arabidopsis thaliana and the plant-parasitic nematode Heterodera schachtii we demonstrate that RLs can significantly reduce infection, whereas their impact on the host plant varies depending on their molecular structure. While mRLs reduced plant growth even at low concentration, dRLs showed no or a beneficial impact on plant development. In addition, the effect of RLs on plant H2O2 production was measured as an indicator of plant defense activity. Treatment with mRLs or dRLs at a concentration of 50 ppm increased H2O2 production. Lower concentrations of up to 10 ppm were used to stimulate plants prior to a treatment with water or flagellin (flg22), a bacterial inducer of plant defense responses. At 10 ppm both mRLs and dRLs fostered an increased response to flg22. However, mRLs also led to an increased response to water, the non-inducing negative control, indicating a generally elevated stress level. Neither mRLs nor dRLs induced expression of plant defense marker genes of salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and ethylene pathways within a 1 hour and 48 hours treatment.\n\nDue to the negative effect of mRLs on plants further studies were concentrated on dRLs. Treatment of pre-parasitic infective juveniles of H. schachtii revealed that dRLs did not increase mortality even at a very high concentration of 755 ppm. In order to analyse the effect of single dRL congeners nematode infection assays were performed. While dRL congeners with a C10-C8 acyl chain increased nematode infection, dRLs with C10-C12 and C10-C12:1 acyl chains reduced nematode infection even at concentrations below 2 ppm. Plant growth was not reduced by C10-C8 dRLs, but by C10-C12 and C10-C12:1 dRLs at concentrations of 8.3 ppm. H2O2 production was increased compared to the water control upon treatment with C10-C8 dRLs at a concentration of 200 ppm, while C10-C12 and C10-C12:1 dRLs triggered the same effect already at 50 ppm.\n\nOur experiments show a clear structure-effect relation. In conclusion, functional assessment and analysis of mode of action of RLs in plants require careful consideration of their molecular structure and composition.",

    "abstract": "Protein design requires a deep control of protein folding energetics, which can be determined experimentally on a case-by-case basis but is not understood in sufficient detail. Calorimetry, protein engineering and biophysical modeling have outlined the fundamentals of protein stability, but these approaches face difficulties in elucidating the specific contributions of the intervening molecules and elementary interactions to the folding energy balance. Recently, we showed that, using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of native proteins and their unfolded ensembles, one can calculate, within experimental error, the enthalpy and heat capacity changes of the folding reaction. Analyzing MD simulations of four model proteins (CI2, barnase, SNase and apoflavodoxin) whose folding enthalpy and heat capacity changes have been successfully calculated, we dissect here the energetic contributions to protein stability made by the different molecular players (polypeptide and solvent molecules) and elementary interactions (electrostatic, van der Waals and bonded) involved. Although the proteins analyzed differ in length (65-168 amino acid residues), isoelectric point (4.0-8.99) and overall fold, their folding energetics is governed by the same quantitative pattern. Relative to the unfolded ensemble, the native conformation is enthalpically stabilized by comparable contributions from protein-protein and solvent-solvent interactions, and it is nearly equally destabilized by interactions between protein and solvent molecules. From the perspective of elementary physical interactions, the native conformation is stabilized by van de Waals and coulombic interactions and is destabilized by bonded interactions. Also common to the four proteins, the sign of the heat capacity change is set by protein-solvent interactions or, from the alternative perspective, by coulombic interactions.",

Instead, defects in duct morphogenesis are driven by dysregulated epithelial cell architecture and mitogenic signaling which result from loss of a transcription-independent Notch1 cortical signaling mechanism that ultimately functions to stabilize adherens junctions and cortical actin. We identify that Notch1 localization and cortical signaling are tied to apical-basal cell restructuring and discover a Notch1-FAM83H interaction underlies stabilization of adherens junctions and cortical actin. Together, these results offer new insights into Notch1 signaling and regulation, and advance a paradigm in which transcriptional and cell adhesive programs might be coordinated by a single receptor.",

These provide a rapid, effective, and non-intrusive means of monitoring biodiversity. Above-ground ecoacoustics is increasingly widespread, but soil ecoacoustics has yet to be utilised in restoration despite its demonstrable effectiveness at detecting meso- and macrofauna acoustic signals. This study applied ecoacoustic tools and indices (Acoustic Complexity Index, Normalised Difference Soundscape Index, and Bioacoustic Index) to measure above- and below-ground biodiversity in a forest restoration chronosequence. We hypothesised that higher acoustic complexity, diversity and high-frequency to low-frequency ratio would be detected in restored forest plots. We collected n = 198 below-ground samples and n = 180 ambient and controlled samples from three recently degraded (within 10 years) and three restored (30-51 years ago) deciduous forest plots across three monthly visits. We used passive acoustic monitoring to record above-ground biological sounds and a below-ground sampling device and sound-attenuation chamber to record soil communities. We found that restored plot acoustic complexity and diversity were higher in the sound-attenuation chamber soil but not in situ or above-ground samples. Moreover, we found that restored plots had a significantly greater high-frequency to low-frequency ratio for soil, but no such association for above-ground samples. Our results suggest that ecoacoustics has the potential to monitor below-ground biodiversity, adding to the restoration ecologists toolkit and supporting global ecosystem recovery.\n\nImplications for PracticeO_LIThis is the first known study to assess the sounds of soil biodiversity in a forest restoration context, paving the way for more comprehensive studies and practical applications to support global ecosystem recovery.\nC_LIO_LISoil ecoacoustics has the potential to support restoration ecology/biodiversity assessments, providing a minimally intrusive, cost-effective and rapid surveying tool. The methods are also relatively simple to learn and apply.\nC_LIO_LIEcoacoustics can contribute toward overcoming the profound challenge of quantifying the effectiveness (i.e., success) of forest restoration interventions in reinstating target species, functions and so-called  services and reducing disturbance.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "New non-destructive tools are needed to reliably assess lymphocyte function for immune profiling and adoptive cell therapy. Optical metabolic imaging (OMI) is a label-free method that measures the autofluorescence intensity and lifetime of metabolic cofactors NAD(P)H and FAD to quantify metabolism at a single-cell level. Here, we investigate whether OMI can resolve metabolic changes between human quiescent versus IL4/CD40 activated B cells and IL12/IL15/IL18 activated memory-like NK cells. We found that quiescent B and NK cells were more oxidized compared to activated cells. Additionally, the NAD(P)H mean fluorescence lifetime decreased and the fraction of unbound NAD(P)H increased in the activated B and NK cells compared to quiescent cells. Machine learning classified B cells and NK cells according to activation state (CD69+) based on OMI parameters with up to 93.4% and 92.6% accuracy, respectively. Leveraging our previously published OMI data from activated and quiescent T cells, we found that the NAD(P)H mean fluorescence lifetime increased in NK cells compared to T cells, and further increased in B cells compared to NK cells. Random forest models based on OMI classified lymphocytes according to subtype (B, NK, T cell) with 97.8% accuracy, and according to activation state (quiescent or activated) and subtype (B, NK, T cell) with 90.0% accuracy. Our results show that autofluorescence lifetime imaging can accurately assess lymphocyte activation and subtype in a label-free, non-destructive manner.\n\nTeaserLabel-free optical imaging can assess the metabolic state of lymphocytes on a single-cell level in a touch-free system.",

    "abstract": "The National Cancer Institutes Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) provides unique opportunities for cancer target discovery using protein expression. Proteomics data from CPTAC tumor types have been primarily generated using a multiplex tandem mass tag (TMT) approach, which is designed to provide protein quantification relative to reference samples. However, relative protein expression data is suboptimal for prioritization of targets within a tissue type, which requires additional reprocessing of the original proteomics data to derive absolute quantitation estimation. We evaluated the feasibility of using differential protein analysis coupled with intensity-based absolute quantification (iBAQ) to identify tumor-enriched and highly expressed cell surface antigens, employing tandem mass tag (TMT) proteomics data from CPTAC. Absolute quantification derived from TMT proteomics data was highly correlated with that of label-free proteomics data from the CPTAC colon adenocarcinoma cohort, which contains proteomics data measured by both approaches. We validated the TMT-iBAQ approach by comparing the iBAQ value to the receptor density value of HER2 and TROP2 measured by flow cytometry in about 30 selected breast and lung cancer cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. Collections of these tumor-enriched and highly expressed cell surface antigens could serve as a valuable resource for the development of cancer therapeutics, including antibody-drug conjugates and immunotherapeutic agents.",

We identify dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) residues, post-translational oxidation products of tyrosine residues, to be common in collagen derived from different connective tissues. We observe that these DOPA residues endow collagen with substantial radical scavenging capacity. When reducing radicals, DOPA residues work as redox relay: they convert to the quinone and generate hydrogen peroxide. In this dual function, DOPA outcompetes its amino acid precursors and ascorbic acid. Our results establish DOPA residues as redox-active side chains of collagens, probably protecting connective tissues against radicals formed under mechanical stress and/or inflammation.",

This study proposes an in-silico approach to identify patient-specific APEs by applying complex networks diagnostics on a novel multiplex data structure as input for a deep learning model. The proposed analytical model identifies patient and tumor-specific APEs with as few as 20 labeled data points. Additionally, the proposed data structure employs complex network theory and other statistical approaches that can better explain and reduce the black box effect of deep learning.

Here, we compare the anti-tumor response induced by the SOS1-KRAS interaction inhibitor, BI-3406, combined with a KRASG12C inhibitor (KRASG12Ci) to those induced by KRASG12Ci alone or combined with SHP2 or EGFR inhibitors. In lung cancer and colorectal cancer (CRC) models, BI-3406 plus KRASG12Ci induces an anti-tumor response stronger than that observed with KRASG12Ci alone and comparable to those by the other combinations. This enhanced anti-tumor response is associated with a stronger and extended suppression of RAS-MAPK signaling. Importantly, BI-3406 plus KRASG12Ci treatment delays the emergence of acquired adagrasib resistance in both CRC and lung cancer models and is associated with re-establishment of anti-proliferative activity in KRASG12Ci-resistant CRC models. Our findings position KRASG12C plus SOS1 inhibition therapy as a promising strategy for treating both KRASG12C-mutated tumors as well as for addressing acquired resistance to KRASG12Ci.",

    "abstract": "Throughout the metastatic cascade, cancer cells are faced with harsh metabolic environments and nutritional stresses which apply selection pressure leaving only the most metabolically resilient cells to survive and form metastases. Metabolic characterisation of such cell populations in vitro is currently challenging. Using galactose as a tool compound to mimic glycolytic limitation within the tumour microenvironment of primary and secondary neoplastic sites, we were able to uncover metabolic flexibility and plasticity of cancer cells in vitro. In contrast to the established idea that high glycolytic flux and expression of dimeric PKM2 redirects carbons towards anabolic routes such as the pentose phosphate pathway and serine synthesis pathway (SSP), we have discovered by using stable-isotope tracing that also glycolytic limitation results in metabolic rewiring. Surprisingly, despite limited carbon availability and energetic stress, cells induce a near complete block of pyruvate kinase isozyme M2 (PKM2) to divert carbons towards SSP. Simultaneously, TCA cycle flux is sustained and oxygen consumption is increased, both supported by glutamine. Glutamine not only supports TCA cycle flux but also SSP via distinct mechanisms. Due to PKM2 block, malic enzyme exclusively supports TCA cycle flux while mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase supports SSP. Moreover, by using genetic modifications of different one-carbon (1C) cycle enzymes, we are able to reverse the PKM2 block suggesting a link between mitochondrial 1C cycle and pyruvate kinase. Thus we show that PKM2 inhibition acts as a branching point to direct glycolytic and glutamine carbons into distinct routes, overall supporting the metabolic plasticity and flexibility of cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSevere lung infection can lead to brain dysfunction and neurobehavioral disorders. The mechanisms that regulate the lung-brain axis of inflammatory response to respiratory infection are incompletely understood. This study examined the effects of lung infection causing systemic and neuroinflammation as a potential mechanism contributing to blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage and behavioral impairment.\n\nMethodsPneumonia was induced in adult C57BL/6 mice by intratracheal inoculation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). Solute extravasation, histology, immunofluorescence, RT-PCR, multiphoton imaging and neurological testing were performed in this study.\n\nResultsLung infection caused alveolar-capillary barrier injury as indicated by leakage of plasma proteins across pulmonary microvessels and histopathological characteristics of pulmonary edema (alveolar wall thickening, microvessel congestion, and neutrophil infiltration). PA also caused significant BBB dysfunction characterized by leakage of different sized molecules across cerebral microvessels and a decreased expression of cell-cell junctions (VE-cadherin, claudin-5) in the brain. BBB leakage peaked at 24 hours and lasted for 7 days post-inoculation. Additionally, mice with lung infection displayed hyperlocomotion and anxiety-like behaviors. To test whether cerebral dysfunction was caused by PA directly or indirectly, we measured bacterial load in multiple organs. While PA loads were detected in the lungs up to 7 days post-inoculation, bacteria were not detected in the brain as evidenced by negative cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) cultures and lack of distribution in different brain regions or isolated cerebral microvessels. However, mice with PA lung infection demonstrated increased mRNA expression in the brain of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1{beta}, IL-6, and TNF-), chemokines (CXCL-1, CXCL-2) and adhesion molecules (VCAM-1 and ICAM-1) along with CD11b+ cell recruitment, corresponding to their increased blood levels of white cells (polymorphonuclear cells) and cytokines. To confirm the direct effect of cytokines on endothelial permeability, we measured cell-cell adhesive barrier resistance and junction morphology in mouse brain microvascular endothelial cell monolayers, where administration of IL-1{beta} induced a significant reduction of barrier function coupled with tight junction (TJ) diffusion and disorganization. Combined treatment with IL-1{beta} and TNF augmented the barrier injury.\n\nConclusionsThese results suggest that lung bacterial infection causes cerebral microvascular leakage and neuroinflammation via a mechanism involving cytokine-induced BBB injury.",

    "abstract": "Scientists have used small molecule inhibitors and genetic knockdown of gene-silencing polycomb repressive complexes (PRC1/2) to determine if restoring the expression of tumor suppressor genes can block proliferation and invasion of cancer cells. A major limitation of this approach is that inhibitors can not restore key transcriptional activators that are mutated in many cancers, such as p53 and members of the BRAF SWI/SNF complex. Furthermore, small molecule inhibitors can alter the activity of, rather than inhibit, the polycomb enzyme EZH2. While chromatin has been shown to play a major role in gene regulation in cancer, poor clinical results for polycomb chromatin-targeting therapies for diseases like triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) could discourage further development of this emerging avenue for treatment. To overcome the limitations of inhibiting polycomb to study epigenetic regulation, we developed an engineered chromatin protein to manipulate transcription. The synthetic reader-actuator (SRA) is a fusion protein that directly binds a target chromatin modification and regulates gene expression. Here, we report the activity of an SRA built from polycomb chromodomain and VP64 modules that bind H3K27me3 and subunits of the Mediator complex, respectively. In SRA-expressing BT-549 cells, we identified 122 upregulated differentially expressed genes (UpDEGs, [&ge;] 2-fold activation, adjusted p < 0.05). On-target epigenetic regulation was determined by identifying UpDEGs at H3K27me3-enriched, closed chromatin. SRA activity induced activation of genes involved in cell death, cell cycle arrest, and the inhibition of migration and invasion. SRA-expressing BT-549 cells showed reduced spheroid size in Matrigel over time, loss of invasion, and activation of apoptosis. These results show that Mediator-recruiting regulators broadly targeted to silenced chromatin activate silenced tumor suppressor genes and stimulate anti-cancer phenotypes. Therefore further development of gene-activating epigenetic therapies might benefit TNBC patients.",

These micro-architectural gradients are reflected in neural activity, which can be captured by neurophysiological time-series. How spontaneous neurophysiological dynamics are organized across the cortex and how they arise from heterogeneous cortical micro-architecture remains unknown. Here we extensively profile regional neurophysiological dynamics across the human brain by estimating over 6 800 timeseries features from the resting state magnetoencephalography (MEG) signal. We then map regional time-series profiles to a comprehensive multi-modal, multi-scale atlas of cortical micro-architecture, including microstructure, metabolism, neurotransmitter receptors, cell types and laminar differentiation. We find that the dominant axis of neurophysiological dynamics reflects characteristics of power spectrum density and linear correlation structure of the signal, emphasizing the importance of conventional features of electromagnetic dynamics while identifying additional informative features that have traditionally received less attention. Moreover, spatial variation in neurophysiological dynamics is colocalized with multiple micro-architectural features, including genomic gradients, intracortical myelin, neurotransmitter receptors and transporters, and oxygen and glucose metabolism.

    "abstract": "In zebra finch, basal ganglia projecting \"HVCX\" neurons emit one or more spike bursts during each song motif (canonical sequence of syllables), which are thought to be driven in part by a process of spike rebound excitation. Zebra finch songs are highly stereotyped and recent results indicate that the intrinsic properties of HVCX neurons are similar within each bird, vary among birds depending on similarity of the songs, and vary with song errors. We tested the hypothesis that the timing of spike bursts during singing also evince individual-specific distributions. Examining previously published data, we demonstrated that the intervals between bursts of multibursting HVCX are similar for neurons within each bird, in many cases highly clustered at distinct peaks, with the patterns varying among birds. The fixed delay between bursts and different times when neurons are first recruited in the song yields precisely timed multiple sequences of bursts throughout the song, not the previously envisioned single sequence of bursts treated as events having statistically independent timing. A given moment in time engages multiple sequences and both single bursting and multibursting HVCX simultaneously. This suggests a model where a population of HVCX sharing common intrinsic properties driving spike rebound excitation influence the timing of a given HVCX burst through lateral inhibitory interactions. Perturbations in burst timing, representing error, could propagate in time. Our results extend the concept of central pattern generators to complex vertebrate vocal learning and suggest that network activity (timing of inhibition) and HVCX intrinsic properties become coordinated during developmental birdsong learning.",

However, the connection between lower limb proprioception and sensorimotor adaptation during human gait has not been established. We suspect this gap is due in part to the lack of reliable, efficient methods to assess global lower limb proprioception in an ecologically valid context.\n\nNew MethodWe assessed static lower limb proprioception using an alternative forced choice task, administered twice to determine test-retest reliability. Participants stood on a dual-belt treadmill which passively moved one limb to stimulus locations selected by a Bayesian adaptive algorithm. At the stimulus locations, participants judged relative foot positions and the algorithm estimated the point of subjective equality (PSE) and the uncertainty of lower limb proprioception.\n\nResultsUsing the Bland-Altman method, combined with Bayesian statistics, we found that both the PSE and uncertainty estimates had good reliability.\n\nComparison with Existing Method(s)Current methods assessing static lower limb proprioception do so within a single joint, in non-weight bearing positions, and rely heavily on memory. One exception assessed static lower limb proprioception in standing but did not measure reliability and contained confounds impacting participants judgments, which we experimentally controlled here.\n\nConclusionsThis efficient and reliable method assessing lower limb proprioception will aid future mechanistic understanding of locomotor adaptation and serve as a useful tool for basic and clinical researchers studying balance and falls.",

By contrast, short-term pharmacological CaMKII inhibition with tatCN19o interfered with learning in mice only mildly and transiently (for less than 1 h) and did not at all reverse pre-formed memories. This was at [&ge;]500fold of the dose that protected hippocampal neurons from cell death after a highly clinically relevant pig model of transient global cerebral ischemia: ventricular fibrillation followed by advanced life support and electrical defibrillation to induce return of spontaneous circulation. Of additional importance for therapeutic development, cardiovascular safety studies in mice and pig did not indicate any concerns with acute tatCN19o injection. Taken together, even though prolonged interference with CaMKII signaling can erase memory, acute short-term CaMKII inhibition with tatCN19o did not cause such retrograde amnesia that would pose a contraindication for therapy.",

    "abstract": "Neocortical activity is thought to mediate voluntary control over vocal production, but the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. In a highly vocal rodent, the Al-stons singing mouse, we investigate neural dynamics in the orofacial motor cortex (OMC), a structure critical for vocal behavior. We first describe neural activity that is modulated by component notes (approx. 100 ms), likely representing sensory feed-back. At longer timescales, however, OMC neurons exhibit diverse and often persistent premotor firing patterns that stretch or compress with song duration (approx. 10 s). Using computational modeling, we demonstrate that such temporal scaling, acting via downstream motor production circuits, can enable vocal flexibility. These results provide a framework for studying hierarchical control circuits, a common design principle across many natural and artificial systems.",

    "abstract": "Song in oscine birds is learned across generations, and aspects of the song-learning process parallel genetic transmission: variation can be introduced into both cultural and genetic traits via copy-error, and both types of traits are subject to drift and selective pressure. Similarly to allele frequencies in population genetics, observing frequencies of birdsong features can improve our understanding of cultural transmission and evolution. Uniquely, community-science databases of birdsong provide rich spatiotemporal data with untapped potential to evaluate cultural evolution in songbirds. Here we use both community-science and field-study recordings of chipping sparrows to examine trends across nearly seven decades of song. We find that some syllable types tend to persist in the population for much longer than others. Persistent songs tend to contain more syllables of shorter duration than songs which were observed across fewer years. To draw inferences about the effects of learning biases on chipping sparrow syllables, we construct a spatially explicit agent-based model of song learning. By comparing our empirical analysis to simulated song distributions using three different song-learning strategies--neutral transmission, conformity bias, and directional selection--we suggest that chipping sparrows are unlikely to select tutors neutrally or with a conformity bias and that they learn their songs with a remarkably low copy-error rate.",

The family also has seven inducible systems (Jungle Express, Psal/NahR, Pm/XylS, Prha/RhaS, LacO1/LacI, LacUV5/LacI, and Ptet/TetR) controlling RFP expression on BBR1/kanamycin plasmid backbones. For four of these inducible systems (Jungle Express, Psal/NahR, LacO1/LacI, and Ptet/TetR), we created variants that utilize the RK2 origin and spectinomycin or gentamicin selection. Relevant RFP expression and growth data have been collected in the model bacterium Escherichia coli as well as Pseudomonas putida.

    "abstract": "One of the most difficult and pressing problems in computational cell biology is the inference of gene regulatory network structure from transcriptomic data. Benchmarking network inference methods on model organism datasets has yielded mixed results, in which the methods sometimes perform reasonably well and other times fail to outperform random guessing. In this paper, we analyze the feasibility of network inference under different noise conditions using stochastic simulations. We show that gene regulatory interactions with extrinsic noise appear to be more amenable to inference than those with only intrinsic noise, especially when the extrinsic noise causes the system to switch between distinct expression states. Furthermore, we analyze the problem of false positives between genes that have no direct interaction but share a common upstream regulator, and explore a strategy for distinguishing between these false positives and true interactions based on noise profiles of mRNA expression levels. Lastly, we derive mathematical formulas for the mRNA noise levels and correlation using moment analysis techniques, and show how these levels change as the mean mRNA expression level changes.",

    "abstract": "The detection of environmental temperatures is critical for survival, yet inappropriate responses to thermal stimuli can have a negative impact on overall health. The physiological effect of cold is distinct among somatosensory modalities in that it is soothing and analgesic, but also agonizing in the context of tissue damage. Inflammatory mediators produced during injury activate nociceptors to release neuropeptides, such as CGRP and substance P, inducing neurogenic inflammation which further exasperates pain. Many inflammatory mediators induce sensitization to heat and mechanical stimuli but, conversely, inhibit cold responsiveness, and the identity of molecules inducing cold pain peripherally is enigmatic, as are the cellular and molecular mechanisms altering cold sensitivity. Here, we asked if inflammatory mediators that induce neurogenic inflammation via the nociceptive ion channels TRPV1 and TRPA1 lead to cold pain in mice. Specifically, we tested cold sensitivity in mice after intraplantar injection of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) or 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4HNE), finding each induces cold pain that is dependent on the cold-gated channel TRPM8. Inhibition of either CGRP, substance P, or toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling attenuates this phenotype, and each neuropeptide produces TRPM8-dependent cold pain directly. Further, the inhibition of CGRP or TLR4 signaling alleviates cold allodynia differentially by sex. Lastly, we find that cold pain induced by inflammatory mediators and neuropeptides requires the neurotrophin artemin and its receptor GFR3. These results demonstrate that tissue damage alters cold sensitivity via neurogenic inflammation, likely leading to localized artemin release that induces cold pain via GFR3 and TRPM8.\n\nSignificance StatementThe cellular and molecular mechanisms that generate pain are complex with a diverse array of pain-producing molecules generated during injury that act to sensitize peripheral sensory neurons, thereby inducing pain. Here we identify a specific neuroinflammatory pathway involving the ion channel TRPM8 and the neurotrophin receptor GFR3 that leads to cold pain, providing select targets for potential therapies for this pain modality.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic rate, the energy required per unit of time for an organism to sustain life, is influenced by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Despite the similarities among living organisms across the various domains of life, it has been observed that those adapted to deep-sea environments exhibit notable distinctions from those in shallower waters, even when accounting for size and temperature. However, as deep-sea organisms are infrequently kept in captivity for prolonged periods, investigations into their potential metabolic responses to food and temperature have yet to be conducted. In this study, we demonstrate the impact of food (specific dynamic action: SDA) and temperature (Q10) on the metabolic rate of the deep-sea isopod Bathynomus doederleini. Positive correlations were found between SDA parameters (peak, time to peak, duration, and factorial scope) and meal size in deep-sea organisms. The postprandial metabolic rate, at a meal size of 45.4%, increased by approximately 6.5-fold, and the duration was 20 days. Within the temperature range of their natural habitat, the overall Q10 was 2.36, indicating that a 10 {degrees}C increase would lead to a 2.4-fold increase in resting metabolic rate. The mean metabolic rate of this species, corrected for the equivalent temperature, was significantly 63% lower than the metabolic scaling rule for aquatic invertebrates. This low metabolic rate suggests that deep-sea isopods can survive for a year on a mere few grams of whale blubber at a water temperature of 10.5 {degrees}C. This information is crucial for understanding the metabolic strategies and consequences of adaptation to a deep-sea environment.",

    "abstract": "Underrepresented populations are often excluded from genomic studies due in part to a lack of resources supporting their analyses. The 1000 Genomes Project (1kGP) and Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP), which have recently been sequenced to high coverage, are valuable genomic resources because of the global diversity they capture and their open data sharing policies. Here, we harmonized a high quality set of 4,096 whole genomes from HGDP and 1kGP with data from gnomAD and identified over 159 million high-quality SNVs, indels, and SVs. We performed a detailed ancestry analysis of this cohort, characterizing population structure and patterns of admixture across populations, analyzing site frequency spectra, and measuring variant counts at global and subcontinental levels. We also demonstrate substantial added value from this dataset compared to the prior versions of the component resources, typically combined via liftover and variant intersection; for example, we catalog millions of new genetic variants, mostly rare, compared to previous releases. In addition to unrestricted individual-level public release, we provide detailed tutorials for conducting many of the most common quality control steps and analyses with these data in a scalable cloud-computing environment and publicly release this new phased joint callset for use as a haplotype resource in phasing and imputation pipelines. This jointly called reference panel will serve as a key resource to support research of diverse ancestry populations.",
