    "abstract": "As metabolomics grows into a high-throughput and high demand research field, current metrics for the identification of small molecules in GC-MS still require manual verification. Though steps have been taken to improve scoring metrics by combining spectral similarity (SS) and retention index (RI), the problem persists. A large body of literature has analyzed and refined SS scores, but few studies have explicitly studied improvements to RI scores. Here, we examined whether uninvestigated assumptions of the RI score are valid and propose ways to improve them. Query RI were matched to library RI with a generous window of +/-35 to avoid unintentional removal of valid compound identifications. Each match was manually verified as a true positive, true negative or unknown. Metabolites with at least 30 true positive identifications were included in downstream analyses, resulting in a total of 87 metabolites from samples of varying complexity and type (e.g., amino acid mixtures, human urine, fungal species, etc.). Our results showed that the RI score assumptions of normality, consistent variance across metabolites, and a mean error centered at 0 are often violated. We demonstrated through a cross-validation analysis that modifying these underlying assumptions according to empirical, metabolite-specific distributions improved the true positive and negative rankings. Further, we statistically determined the minimum number of samples required to estimate distributional parameters for scoring metrics. Overall, this work proposes a robust statistical pipeline to reduce the time bottleneck of metabolite identification by improving RI scores and thus minimizes the effort to complete manual verification.",

    "abstract": "MotivationMany computational tools attempt to infer gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. One recent advance is DeepSEM, a deep generative model generalizing the Linear Structural Equation Model (SEM) that improves benchmark performance over popular GRN inference methods. While DeepSEM is promising, its results are not stable over multiple runs. To overcome the instability and resolve dropout handling concerns, we propose GRN-VAE.\n\nResultsGRN-VAE improves stability and efficiency while maintaining accuracy by delayed introduction of the sparse loss term. To minimize the negative impact of dropout in single-cell data, GRN-VAE trains on non-zero data. Most importantly, we introduce a novel idea, Dropout Augmentation, to improve model robustness by adding a small amount of simulated dropout to the data. GRN-VAE compares favorably to other methods on the BEELINE benchmark data sets, using several collections of \"ground truth\" regulatory relationships, and on a real-world data set, where it efficiently provides stable results consistent with literature-based findings.\n\nConclusionsThe stability and robustness of GRN-VAE make it a practical and valuable addition to the toolkit for GRN inference from single-cell data. Dropout Augmentation may have wider applications beyond the GRN-inference problem.\n\nAvailability and implementationSource code is available at https://bcb.cs.tufts.edu/GRN-VAE\n\nContacthao.zhu@tufts.edu; donna.slonim@tufts.edu",

    "abstract": "Existing phenotype ontologies were originally developed to represent phenotypes that manifest as a character state in relation to a wild-type or other reference. However, these do not include the phenotypic trait or attribute categories required for the annotation of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) mappings or any population-focused measurable trait data. Moreover, variations in gene expression in response to environmental disturbances even without any genetic alterations can also be associated with particular biological attributes. The integration of trait and biological attribute information with an ever increasing body of chemical, environmental and biological data greatly facilitates computational analyses and it is also highly relevant to biomedical and clinical applications.\n\nThe Ontology of Biological Attributes (OBA) is a formalised, species-independent collection of interoperable phenotypic trait categories that is intended to fulfil a data integration role. OBA is a standardised representational framework for observable attributes that are characteristics of biological entities, organisms, or parts of organisms. OBA has a modular design which provides several benefits for users and data integrators, including an automated and meaningful classification of trait terms computed on the basis of logical inferences drawn from domain-specific ontologies for cells, anatomical and other relevant entities. The logical axioms in OBA also provide a previously missing bridge that can computationally link Mendelian phenotypes with GWAS and quantitative traits. The term components in OBA provide semantic links and enable knowledge and data integration across specialised research community boundaries, thereby breaking silos.",

    "abstract": "MotivationPangenomics alignment has emerged as an opportunity to reduce bias in biomedical research. Traditionally, short read aligners--such as Bowtie and BWA--were used to index a single reference genome, which was then used to find approximate alignments of reads to that genome. Unfortunately, these methods can only index a small number of genomes due to the linear-memory requirement of the algorithms used to construct the index. Although there are a couple of emerging pangenome aligners that can index a larger number of genomes more algorithmic progress is needed to build an index for all available data.\n\nResultsEmerging pangenomic methods include VG, Giraffe, and Moni, where the first two methods build an index a variation graph from the multiple alignment of the sequences, and Moni simply indexes all the sequences in a manner that takes the repetition of the sequences into account. Moni uses a preprocessing technique called prefix-free parsing to build a dictionary and parse from the input--these, in turn, are used to build the main run-length encoded BWT, and suffix array of the input. This is accomplished in linear space in the size of the dictionary and parse. Therein lies the open problem that we tackle in this paper. Although the dictionary scales nicely (sub-linear) with the size of the input, the parse becomes orders of magnitude larger than the dictionary. To scale the construction of Moni, we need to remove the parse from the construction of the RLBWT and suffix array. We accomplish this, in this paper by applying prefix-free parsing recursively on the parse. Although conceptually simple, this leads to an algorithmic challenge of constructing the RLBWT and suffix array without access to the parse. We solve this problem, implement it, and demonstrate that this improves the construction time by a factor of 8.9 the running time and by a factor of 2.7 the memory required.\n\nAvailabilityOur implementation is open source and available at https://github.com/marco-oliva/r-pfbwt.\n\nContactMarco Oliva at marco.oliva@ufl.edu",

Dysfunction of NaV1.6 has been linked to epileptic encephalopathy, intellectual disability and movement disorders. Here we present cryo-EM structures of human NaV1.6/{beta}1/{beta}2 alone and complexed with a guanidinium neurotoxin 4,9-anhydro-tetrodotoxin (4,9-ah-TTX), revealing molecular mechanism of NaV1.6 inhibition by the blocker. In the apo-form structure, two potential Na+ binding sites were revealed in the selectivity filter, suggesting a possible mechanism for Na+ selectivity and conductance. In the 4,9-ah-TTX-bound structure, 4,9-ah-TTX binds to a pocket similar to the tetrodotoxin (TTX) binding site, which occupies the Na+ binding sites and completely blocks the channel. Molecular dynamics simulation results show that subtle conformational differences in the selectivity filter affect the affinity of TTX analogues. Taken together, our results provide important insights into NaV1.6 structure, ion conductance, and inhibition.",

Here we report an approach to control the number of bound RTX molecules (0-to-4) in functional mouse TRPV1. The approach allowed direct measurements of each of the intermediate open states under equilibrium conditions at both macroscopic and single-molecule levels. We found that RTX binding to each of the four subunits contributes virtually the same activation energy, which we estimated to be 1.86 kcal/mol and found to arise predominately from destabilizing the closed conformation. We further showed that sequential bindings of RTX increase open probability without altering single-channel conductance, confirming that there is likely a single open-pore conformation for TRPV1 activated by RTX.",

This makes it possible to study the shape of specifically-labelled membraneous structures inside of cells. We validate NanoWrap using simulations and demonstrate its reconstruction capabilities on SMLM data of the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. NanoWrap is implemented in the open-source Python Microscopy Environment.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEWe introduce a novel tool for reconstruction of subcellular membrane surfaces from single-molecule localization microscopy data and use it to visualize and quantify local shape and membrane-membrane interactions.

    "abstract": "PTEN dysfunction, caused by loss of lipid phosphatase activity or deletion, promotes pathologies, cancer, benign tumors, and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Despite efforts, exactly how the mutations trigger distinct phenotypic outcomes, cancer or NDD, has been puzzling. It has also been unclear how to distinguish between mutations harbored by isoforms, are they cancer or NDDs-related. Here we address both. We demonstrate that PTEN mutations differentially allosterically bias P-loop dynamics and its connection to the catalytic site, affecting catalytic activity. NDD-related mutations are likely to sample conformations present in the wild-type, while sampled conformations sheltering cancer-related hotspots favor catalysis-prone conformations, suggesting that NDD mutations are weaker. Analysis of isoform expression data indicates that if the transcript has NDD-related mutations, alone or in combination with cancer hotspots, there is high prenatal expression. If no mutations within the measured days, low expression levels. Cancer mutations promote stronger signaling and cell proliferation; NDDs are weaker, influencing brain cell differentiation. Further, exon 5 is impacted by NDD or non-NDD mutations, while exon 7 is exclusively impacted by NDD mutations. Our comprehensive conformational and genomic analysis helps discover how same allele mutations can foster different clinical manifestations and uncovers correlations of splicing isoform expression to life expectancy.",

    "abstract": "The prevailing model of steroid hormone nuclear receptor function assumes ligand-induced homodimer formation followed by binding to DNA hormone response elements (HREs). This model has been challenged by evidence showing that the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) forms tetramers upon ligand and DNA binding, which then drive receptor-mediated gene transactivation and transrepression. GR and the closely-related mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) interact to transduce corticosteroid hormone signaling, but whether they share the same quaternary arrangement is unknown. Here, we used a fluorescence imaging technique, Number & Brightness, to study oligomerization in a cell system allowing real-time analysis of receptor-DNA interactions. Agonist-bound MR forms tetramers in the nucleoplasm and higher order oligomers upon binding to HREs. Antagonists form intermediate quaternary arrangements, suggesting that large oligomers are essential for function. Divergence between MR and GR quaternary structure is driven by different functionality of known and new multimerization interfaces, which does not preclude formation of heteromers. Thus, influencing oligomerization may be important to selectively modulate corticosteroid signaling.",

    "abstract": "Recent investigations have suggested that biomolecular condensates are viscoelastic materials. This implies that material properties of condensates are governed by internal microstructures. Furthermore, computations show that the internal organization in protein condensates is spatially inhomogeneous, featuring hub-and-spoke-like percolated networks of molecules. Here, we test these predictions using imaging of single fluorogenic dyes that are turned-on in response to specific chemical microenvironments. We deployed Nile blue (NB), Nile red (NR), and merocyanine 540 (MC540) for epifluorescence and single-molecule localization microscopy imaging of condensates formed by intrinsically disordered, low-complexity domains of proteins. Imaging with NB reveals internal environments that are uniformly hydrophobic, whereas NR shows preferential binding to hubs that are more hydrophobic than the surrounding background within condensates. Finally, imaging with MC540 suggests that interfaces of condensates are unique chemical environments. Overall, the high spatiotemporal resolution and environmental sensitivity of single-fluorogen imaging reveals spatially inhomogeneous organization of molecules within condensates.",

Each clinical site utilizes distinct BME lots and may be restricted due to the availability of commercial BME sources. However, the impact of different sources and lots of BMEs on organoid drug response is unknown. Here, we tested the impact of BME source and lot on proliferation, chemotherapy and targeted therapy drug response, and gene expression in mouse and human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) organoids. Both human and mouse organoids displayed increased proliferation in Matrigel (Corning) compared to Cultrex (RnD) and UltiMatrix (RnD). However, we observed no substantial impact on drug response when oragnoids were cultured in Matrigel, Cultrex, or UltiMatrix. We also did not observe major shifts in gene expression across the different BME sources, and PDOs maintained their Classical or Basal-like designation.

    "abstract": "Abstract/SummaryOncogenic RAS mutations drive aggressive cancers that are difficult to treat in the clinic, and while direct inhibition of the most common KRAS variant in lung adenocarcinoma (G12C) is undergoing clinical evaluation, a wide spectrum of oncogenic RAS variants together make up a large percentage of untargetable lung and GI cancers. Here we report that loss-of-function alterations (mutations and deep deletions) in the gene that encodes HD-PTP (PTPN23) occur in up to 14% of lung cancers in the ORIEN Avatar lung cancer cohort, associate with adenosquamous histology, and occur alongside an altered spectrum of KRAS alleles. Furthermore, we show that in publicly available early-stage NSCLC studies loss of HD-PTP is mutually exclusive with loss of LKB1, which suggests they restrict a common oncogenic pathway in early lung tumorigenesis. In support of this, knockdown of HD-PTP in RAS-transformed lung cancer cells is sufficient to promote FAK-dependent invasion. Lastly, knockdown of the Drosophila homolog of HD-PTP (dHD-PTP/Myopic) synergizes to promote RAS-dependent neoplastic progression. Our findings highlight a novel tumor suppressor that can restrict RAS-driven lung cancer oncogenesis and identify a targetable pathway for personalized therapeutic approaches for adenosquamous lung cancer.",

    "abstract": "Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) has limited therapeutic options and a dismal prognosis. Anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy combined with gemcitabine/cisplatin chemotherapy has recently shown efficacy in biliary tract cancers, but responses are seen only in a minority of patients. Here, we studied the roles of anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA-4 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies when combined with gemcitabine/cisplatin and the mechanisms of treatment benefit in orthotopic murine ICC models. We evaluated the effects of the combined treatments on ICC vasculature and immune microenvironment using flow cytometry analysis, immunofluorescence, imaging mass cytometry, RNA-sequencing, qPCR, and in vivo T-cell depletion and CD8+ T-cell transfer using orthotopic ICC models and transgenic mice. Combining gemcitabine/cisplatin with anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies led to substantial survival benefits and reduction of morbidity in two aggressive ICC models, which were ICB-resistant. Gemcitabine/cisplatin treatment increased the frequency of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and normalized the ICC vessels, and when combined with dual CTLA-4/PD1 blockade, increased the number of activated CD8+Cxcr3+IFN-{gamma}+ T-cells. Depletion of CD8+ but not CD4+ T-cells compromised efficacy. Conversely, CD8+ T-cell transfer from Cxcr3-/- versus Cxcr3+/+ mice into Rag1-/- immunodeficient mice restored the anti-tumor effect of gemcitabine/cisplatin/ICB combination therapy. Finally, rational scheduling of the ICBs (anti-CTLA-4 \"priming\") with chemotherapy and anti-PD1 therapy achieved equivalent efficacy with continuous dosing while reducing overall drug exposure. In summary, gemcitabine/cisplatin chemotherapy normalizes vessel structure, increases activated T-cell infiltration, and enhances anti-PD1/CTLA-4 immunotherapy efficacy in aggressive murine ICC. This combination approach should be clinically tested to overcome resistance to current therapies in ICC patients.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryImmune microenvironment reprogramming by chemotherapy and priming using CTLA-4 blockade render ICCs responsive to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "In modern science, interdisciplinary and collaborative research is encouraged among scientists to solve complex problems. However, when the time comes to measure an individuals academic productivity, collaborative efforts are hard to conceptualize and quantify. In this study, we hypothesized that a social behavior coined \"scientific civility\", which encompasses civility, collaboration, cooperation, or a combination of these, enhances an individuals productivity influencing their academic performance. To facilitate recognition of this unique attribute within the scientific environment, we developed a new indicator: the C score. We examined publicly available data from 579 academic scientists at the individual-level, focusing on their scholarly output and collaborative networks as a function of geographic distribution and time. Our findings demonstrate that the C score gauges academic performance from an integral perspective based on a synergistic interaction between productivity and collaborative networks, prevailing over institutionally limited economic resources and minimizing inequalities related to the length of individuals academic career, field of investigation, and gender.\n\nSignificance StatementThe increased connectivity between fields and specialties of science is undeniable. We propose a new indicator, the C score, to assess the value of collaborative efforts and research output to a scientists academic performance. This indicator reflects collaborative and interdisciplinary efforts and provides a measure of \"scientific civility\" and teamwork. The C score can be used as a decision-making tool to track career advancement within the academic environment. Along with other indicators such as the h index, the C score supports a more integrative and holistic assessment of an individuals academic performance.",

    "abstract": "Time to degree completion is an important metric of academic progress and success for doctoral students. It is also a common way for educational stakeholders to compare programs even if the content of the degree programs varies. But what types of behaviors and experiences are associated with faster times to degree? In this education article, we examine the relationship between receiving competitive research awards (e.g. grant writing) and time to degree for PhD students. We organize our analyses by student identities, specifically gender and underrepresented minority (URM) status, to examine differences in time to degree based on student demographics. Our dataset included students that graduated between academic years 2008-09 through 2018-19. We also interviewed students currently enrolled in these same programs. We find that URM women who won competitive research awards graduate faster than all other students who also won awards but also report lower levels of advisor support. We also find that URM women and all URM students tended to graduate faster compared to other groups of students who did not win awards. Students who reported feeling supported by their advisors, most of which reflected hands-on guidance through the writing process, in the interviews were more likely to apply for grants. Combined, these results highlight that writing grants and specific types of advisor support may influence faster times to degree for bioscience PhD students. This study suggests similar introspective analyses at other institutions and databases are needed.",

    "abstract": "Myosin functions as the \"molecular motor\" of the sarcomere and generates the contractile force necessary for cardiac muscle contraction. Myosin light chains 1 and 2 (MLC-1 and -2) play important functional roles in regulating the structure of the hexameric myosin molecule. Each of these light chains has an  atrial and  ventricular isoform, so called because they are believed to exhibit chamber-restricted expression in the heart. However, recently the chamber-specific expression of MLC isoforms in the human heart has been questioned. Herein, we analyzed the expression of MLC-1 and -2 atrial and ventricular isoforms in each of the four cardiac chambers in adult non-failing donor hearts using top-down mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics. Strikingly, we detected an isoform thought to be ventricular, MLC-2v, in the atria and confirmed the protein sequence using tandem MS (MS/MS). For the first time, a putative deamidation post-translation modification (PTM) located on MLC-2v in atrial tissue was localized to amino acid N13. MLC-1v and MLC-2a were the only MLC isoforms exhibiting chamber-restricted expression patterns across all donor hearts. Importantly, our results unambiguously show that MLC-1v, not MLC-2v, is ventricle-specific in adult human hearts. Overall, top-down proteomics allowed us an unbiased analysis of MLC isoform expression throughout the human heart, uncovering previously unexpected isoform expression patterns and PTMs.",

At the most basic level, this cell cycle oscillator is driven by negative feedback: active cyclin B Cdk1 activates the Anaphase-Promoting Complex - Cyclosome, which triggers the degradation of cyclin B. Such cell cycle oscillations occur fast and periodically in the early embryos of the frog Xenopus laevis, where several positive feedback loops leading to bistable switches in parts of the regulatory network have been experimentally identified. Here, we build cell cycle oscillator models to show how single and multiple bistable switches in parts of the underlying regulatory network change the properties of the oscillations and how they can confer robustness to the oscillator. We present a detailed bifurcation analysis of these models.",

    "abstract": "Interferon-{gamma} (IFN{gamma}) is a critical anti-tumor cytokine that has varied effects on different cell types. The global effect of IFN{gamma} in the tumor depends on which cells it acts upon and the spatial extent of its spread. Reported measurements of IFN{gamma} spread vary dramatically in different contexts, ranging from nearest-neighbor signaling to perfusion throughout the entire tumor. Here, we apply theoretical considerations to experiments both in vitro and in vivo to study the spread of IFN{gamma} in melanomas. We observe spatially confined niches of IFN{gamma} signaling in 3-D mouse melanoma cultures and human tumors that generate cellular heterogeneity in gene expression and alter the susceptibility of affected cells to T cell killing. Widespread IFN{gamma} signaling only occurs when niches overlap due to high local densities of IFN{gamma}-producing T cells. We measured length scales of [~]30-40m for IFN{gamma} spread in B16 mouse melanoma cultures and human primary cutaneous melanoma. Our results are consistent with IFN{gamma} spread being governed by a simple diffusion-consumption model, and offer insight into how the spatial organization of T cells contributes to intra-tumor heterogeneity in inflammatory signaling, gene expression, and immune-mediated clearance. Solid tumors are often viewed as collections of diverse cellular \"neighborhoods\": our work provides a general explanation for such non-genetic cellular variability due to confinement in the spread of immune mediators.",

    "abstract": "Sex is often used to describe a suite of phenotypic and genotypic traits of an organism related to reproduction. However, these traits - gamete type, chromosomal inheritance, physiology, morphology, behavior, etc. - are not necessarily coupled, and the rhetorical collapse of variation into a single term elides much of the complexity inherent in sexual phenotypes. We argue that consideration of  sex as a constructed category operating at multiple biological levels opens up new avenues for inquiry in our study of biological variation. We apply this framework to three case studies that illustrate the diversity of sex variation, from decoupling sexual phenotypes to the evolutionary and ecological consequences of intrasexual polymorphisms. We argue that instead of assuming binary sex in these systems, some may be better categorized as multivariate and nonbinary. Finally, we conduct a meta-analysis of terms used to describe diversity in sexual phenotypes in the scientific literature to highlight how a multivariate model of sex can clarify, rather than cloud, studies of sexual diversity within and across species. We argue that such an expanded framework of  sex better equips us to understand evolutionary processes, and that as biologists it is incumbent upon us to push back against misunderstandings of the biology of sexual phenotypes that enact harm on marginalized communities.",

    "abstract": "Growing evidence highlights a complex interaction between olfaction and metabolism with impaired olfactory function observed in obesity and increased olfactory sensitivity during hunger. The mechanisms linking metabolic state and olfaction remain unknown, but increased accessibility of hormones, such as ghrelin, and the diverse expression of hormone receptors such as those for ghrelin (GHSRs) in the olfactory system suggests an underappreciated neuroendocrine role. Here, we examined the hypothesis that GHSRs in the olfactory bulb (OB) link hunger with olfactory sensitivity to influence foraging behaviours and metabolism. Selective deletion of OBGHSRs in adult male mice was achieved with adeno-associated viral expression of cre-recombinase in the OB of floxed-Ghsr mice. OBGHSR deletion significantly affected olfactory discrimination and habituation to both food and pheromone odours, with greatest effect under fasted conditions. Anxiety-like and depression-like behaviour was significantly greater after OBGHSR deletion using 3 independent anxiety behavioural tasks and testing for anhedonia, whereas exploratory behaviour was reduced. No effect on spatial navigation and memory was observed. Although OBGHSR deletion did not affect cumulative food intake, it significantly impacted feeding behaviour as evidenced by altered bout number and duration. Moreover, food-finding after fasting or ip ghrelin was attenuated. Intriguingly, OBGHSR deletion caused an increase in body weight and fat mass, spared fat utilisation on a chow diet and impaired glucose metabolism indicating metabolic dysfunction. We conclude that OBGHSRs maintain olfactory sensitivity, particularly during hunger, and facilitate behavioural adaptations that optimise food-seeking in anxiogenic environments, priming metabolic pathways in preparation for food consumption.",

This mathematical framework has proven critical to understanding perception, cognition, motor control, and social interaction. While theoretical work has shown how priors can be computed from environmental statistics, their neural instantiation could be realised through multiple competing encoding schemes. Using a data-driven approach, here we extract the brains representation of visual orientation and compare this with simulations from different sensory coding schemes. We found that the tuning of the human visual system is highly conditional on stimulus-specific variations in a way that is not predicted by previous proposals. We further show that the adopted encoding scheme effectively embeds an environmental prior for natural image statistics within the sensory measurement, providing the functional architecture necessary for optimal inference in the earliest stages of cortical processing.",

However, the interconnections between these neuropathological changes and how they act synergistically to promote irreversible neurodegeneration remain unclear. Here we show that abrogating the BRCA1-associated protein Brap in cerebral cortical neurons, as opposed to vascular endothelium cells, causes cerebrovascular defects. This non-cell autonomous effect is mediated by cellular senescence resulting from persistent neuronal DSBs. We show that in the state of senescence, there is a massive upregulation of genes involved in cell secretion, inflammatory responses, and vascular changes, which coincides with cerebral microclots and microbleeds. The vascular lesions intertwine with neuroinflammation and exacerbate neuronal DSBs, culminating in oxidative stress, metabolic alteration, and downregulation of genes essential for neuronal function.

    "abstract": "Working memory is a fundamental cognitive function which allows to transiently store and manipulate relevant information in memory. While it has been traditionally linked to activity in specific prefrontal cortical areas, recent electrophysiological and imaging evidence has shown co-occurrent activities in different brain regions during working memory. To dissect the mechanisms behind the emergence of such distributed working memory activity in the human brain, we built and analyzed a detailed, data-constrained model of the human brain combining multiple sources of large-scale brain data. The model reveals the emergence of distributed working memory patterns which rely on long-range synaptic projections, differing from classical models where working memory emerges due to local recurrent connectivity. When compared to existing evidence regarding areas linked to working memory, our model explains almost 80% of the observed variability across brain areas. Our results predict important differences between the distributed working memory in human and non-human primates, and propose a potential solution for the debate regarding the role of early visual areas in working memory encoding. This work provides a novel approach to simulate the human brain which combines the richness of large-scale brain dynamics with the insight of mechanistic models of cognitive functions.",

There are three neuronal isoforms, PP1, PP1{beta}, and PP1{gamma}, but little is known about their individual functions. PP1 and PP1{gamma} are assumed to mediate the effects of PP1 on learning and memory based on their enrichment at dendritic spines and their preferential binding to neurabin and spinophilin, major PP1 synaptic scaffolding proteins. However, it was recently discovered that human de novo PP1{beta} mutations cause intellectual disability, suggesting an important but ill-defined role for PP1{beta}. In this study, we investigated the functions of each PP1 isoform in hippocampal synaptic physiology using conditional CA1-specific knockout mice. In stark contrast to classic PP1 function, we found that PP1{beta} promotes synaptic plasticity as well as spatial memory. These changes in synaptic plasticity and memory are accompanied by changes in GluA1 phosphorylation, GluN2A levels, and dendritic spine density and morphology, including silent synapse number. These functions of PP1{beta} reveal a previously unidentified signaling pathway regulating spine maturation and plasticity, broadening our understanding of the complex role of PP1 in synaptic physiology.",

    "abstract": "Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a known inducer of inflammatory signaling which triggers generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell death in responsive cells like THP-1 promonocytes and freshly isolated human monocytes. A key LPS-responsive metabolic pivot point is the 9 megadalton mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), which provides pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1), lipoamide-linked transacetylase (E2) and lipoamide dehydrogenase (E3) activities to produce acetyl-CoA from pyruvate. While phosphorylation-dependent decreases in PDC activity following LPS treatment or sepsis have been deeply investigated, redox-linked processes have received less attention. Data presented here demonstrate that LPS-induced reversible oxidation within PDC occurs in PDCE2 in both THP-1 cells and primary human monocytes. Knockout of PDCE2 by CRISPR and expression of FLAG-tagged PDCE2 in THP-1 cells demonstrated that LPS-induced glutathionylation is associated with wild type PDCE2 but not mutant protein lacking the lipoamide-linking lysine residues. Moreover, the mitochondrially-targeted electrophile MitoCDNB, which impairs both glutathione-and thioredoxin-based reductase systems, elevates ROS similar to LPS but does not cause PDCE2 glutathionylation. However, LPS and MitoCDNB together are highly synergistic for PDCE2 glutathionylation, ROS production, and cell death. Surprisingly, the two treatments together had differential effects on cytokine production; pro-inflammatory IL-1{beta} production was enhanced by the co-treatment, while IL-10, an important anti-inflammatory cytokine, dropped precipitously compared to LPS treatment alone. This new information may expand opportunities to understand and modulate PDC redox status and activity and improve the outcomes of pathological inflammation.\n\nHighlightsO_LIPDCE2 is glutathionylated (-SSG) during acute inflammation in monocytes\nC_LIO_LILipopolysaccharide-induced PDCE2-SSG occurs in THP1 cells and human monocytes.\nC_LIO_LILipoamide-deficient PDCE2 lowers LPS-induced PDCE2-SSG and ROS production.\nC_LIO_LIMitoCDNB leads to ROS production without PDCE2-SSG, but is synergistic with LPS\nC_LIO_LIMitoCDNB causes the LPS-stimulated cytokine profile to become more proinflammatory\nC_LI\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=81 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/525791v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (23K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d509beorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@72b40borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8a4596org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1de8148_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "NK cells are important mediators of innate immunity and play an essential role for host protection against infection, although their responses to bacteria are poorly understood. Recently NK cells were shown to display memory properties, as characterized by an epigenetic signature leading to a stronger secondary response. Although NK cell memory could be a promising mechanism to fight against infection, it has not been described upon bacterial infection. Here, we reveal that NK cells develop specific and long-term memory following sub-lethal infection with the extracellular pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. Memory NK cells display intrinsic sensing and response to bacteria in vitro, in a manner that is enhanced post-bacterial infection. In addition, their transfer into naive mice confer protection from lethal infection for at least 12 weeks. Interestingly, NK cells display enhanced cytotoxic molecule production upon secondary stimulation and their protective role is dependent on Perforin and independent of IFN{gamma}. Thus, our study identifies a new role for NK cells during bacterial infection, opening the possibility to harness innate immune memory for therapeutic purposes.",

    "abstract": "The attachment of bacteria onto a surface, consequent signaling, and the accumulation and growth of the surface-bound bacterial population are key initial steps in the formation of pathogenic biofilms. While recent reports have hinted that the stiffness of a surface may affect the accumulation of bacteria on that surface, the processes that underlie bacterial perception of and response to surface stiffness are unknown. Furthermore, whether, and how, the surface stiffness impacts biofilm development, after initial accumulation, is not known. We use thin and thick hydrogels to create stiff and soft composite materials, respectively, with the same surface chemistry. Using quantitative microscopy, we find that the accumulation, motility, and growth of the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa respond to surface stiffness, and that these are linked through cyclic-di-GMP signaling that depends on surface stiffness. The mechanical cue stemming from surface stiffness is elucidated using finite-element modeling combined with experiments - adhesion to stiffer surfaces results in greater changes in mechanical stress and strain in the bacterial envelope than does adhesion to softer surfaces with identical surface chemistry. The cell-surface-exposed protein PilY1 acts as a mechanosensor, that upon surface engagement, results in higher cyclic-di-GMP levels, lower motility, and greater accumulation on stiffer surfaces. PilY1 impacts the biofilm lag phase, which is extended for bacteria attaching to stiffer surfaces. This study shows clear evidence that bacteria actively respond to different stiffness of surfaces where they adhere via perceiving varied mechanical stress and strain upon surface engagement.\n\nImportanceBacteria colonize many types of biological and medical surfaces with a large range of stiffnesses. Colonization leads to the formation of biofilms, which cause costly and life-impairing chronic infections. However, whether and how bacteria can sense and respond to the mechanical cue provided by surface stiffness has remained unknown. We find that bacteria do indeed respond to surface stiffness in a way that is both consistent with expectations based on equilibrium continuum mechanics and that quantitatively impacts multiple aspects of early biofilm formation. This is a new understanding for the nascent field of bacterial mechanobiology. Furthermore, this finding suggests the possibility of a new category of approaches to hindering biofilm development by tuning the mechanical properties of biomedical surfaces.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFollowing viral infection, genetically manipulated mice lacking immunoregulatory function may develop colitis and dysbiosis in a strain specific fashion that serves as a model for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We found that one such model of spontaneous colitis, the interleukin (IL)-10 knockout (IL-I0-/-) model derived from the SvEv mouse, had evidence of increased mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) viral RNA expression compared to the SvEv wildtype. MMTV is endemic in several mouse strains as an endogenously encoded betaretrovirus that is passaged as an exogenous agent in breast milk. As MMTV requires a viral superantigen to replicate in the gut associated lymphoid tissue prior to the development of systemic infection, we evaluated whether MMTV may contribute to the development of colitis in the IL-10-/- model.\n\nResultsViral preparations extracted from IL-10-/- weanling stomachs revealed augmented MMTV load compared to the SvEv wildtype. Illumina sequencing of the viral genome revealed that the two largest contigs shared 96.4% - 97.3% identity with the mtv-1 endogenous loci and the MMTV(HeJ) exogenous virus from the C3H mouse. The MMTV sag gene cloned from IL-10-/- spleen encoded the MTV-9 superantigen that preferentially activates T cell receptor V{beta}-12 subsets, which were expanded in the IL-10-/- versus the SvEv colon. Evidence of MMTV cellular immune responses to MMTV Gag peptides was observed in the IL-10-/- splenocytes with amplified interferon-{gamma} production versus the SvEv wildtype. To address the hypothesis that MMTV may contribute to colitis, we used HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors, tenofovir and emtricitabine, and the HIV protease inhibitor, lopinavir boosted with ritonavir, for 12 weeks treatment versus placebo. The combination anti-retroviral therapy with known activity against MMTV was associated with reduced colonic MMTV RNA and improved histological score in IL10-/- mice, as well as diminished secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and modulation of the microbiome associated with colitis.\n\nConclusionsThis study suggests that immunogenetically manipulated mice with deletion of IL-10 may have reduced capacity to contain MMTV infection in a mouse-strain specific manner, and the antiviral inflammatory responses may contribute to the complexity of IBD with the development of colitis and dysbiosis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNatriuretic peptide system (NPS) and renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) function oppositely at multiple levels. While it has long been suspected that angiotensin II (ANGII) may directly suppress NPS activity, no clear evidence to date support this notion.\n\nObjectivesThis study was designed to systematically investigate ANGII-NPS interaction in humans, in vivo, and in vitro for translational insights.\n\nMethodsCirculating atrial, b-type, and c-type natriuretic peptides (ANP, BNP, CNP), cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), and ANGII were simultaneously investigated in 128 human subjects. Prompted hypothesis was validated in rat model to determine influence of ANGII on ANP actions. Multiple engineered HEK293 cells and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology were leveraged for mechanistic exploration.\n\nResultsIn humans, ANGII showed inverse relationship with ANP, BNP, and cGMP. In regression models predicting cGMP, adding ANGII levels and interaction term between ANGII and natriuretic peptide increased predicting accuracy of base models constructed with either ANP or BNP, but not CNP. Importantly, stratified correlation analysis further revealed positive association between cGMP with ANP or BNP only in subjects with low, but not high, ANGII levels. In rats, co-infusion of ANGII even at physiological dose attenuated blood pressure reduction and cGMP generation triggered by ANP infusion. In vitro, we showed that the suppression effect of ANGII on ANP-stimulated cGMP requires the presence of ANGII type-1 (AT1) receptor and mechanistically involves protein kinase C (PKC), which can be substantially rescued by either valsartan (AT1 blocker) or Go6983 (PKC inhibitor). Using SPR, we showed ANGII has low affinity for particulate guanylyl cyclase A (GC-A) receptor binding compared to ANP or BNP.\n\nConclusionsOur study reveals ANGII as a natural suppressor for cGMP-generating action of GC-A via AT1/PKC dependent manner and highlights importance of dual-targeting RAAS and NPS in maximizing beneficial properties of natriuretic peptides in cardiovascular disease.\n\nSTRUCTURED GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=95 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/525806v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (29K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6febe8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e8e21corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@54a98eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@47ade7_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG CLINICAL PERSPECTIVESAccumulating evidence continues to support the NPS as a promising therapeutic target via the function of the GC-A receptor and production of the second messenger cGMP for heart failure, hypertension, and other cardiovascular diseases. Improving our mechanistic understanding on GC-A/cGMP pathway regulation may further advance the development of novel NPS enhancing therapies. Here we report evidence from multiple avenues supporting a fundamental, yet previously underappreciated mechanism involving a negative action of ANGII in suppressing GC-A receptor-mediated cGMP production via an AT1 receptor-dependent manner. This study also provides a solid rationale for the superiority of combinatory neurohormonal therapies such as sacubitril/valsartan in treating cardiovascular disease, and further highlights a promising therapeutic avenue of dual targeting both the NPS and RAAS to maximize protection.",

    "abstract": "Multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common nosocomial respiratory pathogen that continues to threaten the lives of mechanically-ventilated patients in intensive care units and those with underlying comorbidities such as cystic fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. For over 20 years, studies have repeatedly demonstrated that the major siderophore pyoverdine is an important virulence factor for P. aeruginosa in invertebrate and mammalian hosts in vivo. Despite its physiological significance, an in vitro, mammalian cell culture model to characterize the impact and the molecular mechanism of pyoverdine during infection has only recently been developed. In this study, we adapt a previously-established murine macrophage-based model for human bronchial epithelial cells. We demonstrate that pyoverdine-rich conditioned medium from P. aeruginosa disrupts epithelial integrity in a manner that depends on protease activity and the type II secretion system. Disrupting pyoverdine production, whether genetically or chemically, mitigates this damage. Interestingly, this damage did not require exotoxin A or PrpL (protease IV), two previously-characterized toxins regulated by pyoverdine. We also examined the effects of exposure to purified pyoverdine on lung epithelial cells. While pyoverdine accumulates within cells, the siderophore is largely sequestered inside early endosomes, showing little cytotoxicity. This is in contrast to other, more membrane-permeable iron chelators and siderophores such as pyochelin. However, pyoverdine may indirectly contribute to lung inflammation by potentiating these iron chelators in promoting the production of proinflammatory cytokines.",

    "abstract": "The pathogenic yeast Candida krusei is more distantly related to Candida albicans than clinically relevant CTG-clade Candida species. Its cell wall, a dynamic organelle that is the first point of interaction between pathogen and host, is relatively understudied, and its wall proteome remains unidentified to date. Here, we present an integrated study of the cell wall in C. krusei. Our comparative genomic studies and experimental data indicate that the general structure of the cell wall in C. krusei is similar to Saccharomyces cerevisiae and C. albicans and is comprised of {beta}-1,3-glucan, {beta}-1,6-glucan, chitin, and mannoproteins. However, some pronounced differences with C. albicans walls were observed, for instance, higher mannan and protein levels and altered protein mannosylation patterns. Further, despite absence of proteins with high sequence similarity to Candida adhesins, protein structure modeling identified eleven proteins related to flocculins/adhesins in S. cerevisiae or C. albicans. To obtain a proteomic comparison of biofilm and planktonic cells, C. krusei cells were grown to exponential phase and in static 24-h cultures. Interestingly, the 24-h static cultures of C. krusei yielded formation of floating biofilm (flor) rather than adherence to polystyrene at the bottom. The proteomic analysis of both conditions identified a total of 32 cell wall proteins. In line with a possible role in flor formation, increased abundance of flocculins, in particular Flo110, was observed in the floating biofilm compared to exponential cells. This study is the first to provide a detailed description of the cell wall in C. krusei including its cell wall proteome, and paves the way for further investigations on the importance of flor formation and flocculins in the pathogenesis of C. krusei.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe yeast Candida krusei is among the five most prevalent causal agents of candidiasis but its mechanisms underlying pathogenicity have been scarcely studied. This is also true for its cell wall structure, an essential organelle that governs primary host-pathogen interactions and host immune responses. Solid knowledge about cell wall synthesis and dynamics is crucial for the development of novel antifungal strategies against this pathogenic yeast. Here, through a combination of comparative genomics, protein structure modeling, and biochemical and proteomic analysis of purified walls, we present a detailed study of the cell wall composition in C. krusei and identify important architectural differences compared to C. albicans cell walls. Cell walls of C. krusei contain higher mannan and protein levels with altered mannan branching patterns, governed by expansions and reductions in gene families encoding mannosyltransferases. We also show that, in contrast to other Candida species, static cultures produce floating biofilms. Comparative wall proteomic studies of these biofilms show increased abundance of flocculins and hydrolytic enzymes, protein classes implicated in biofilm formation and primary host-pathogen interactions leading to tissue colonization. In conclusion, our study uncovers important keys towards a better molecular understanding of the virulence mechanisms of the important pathogen C. krusei.",

    "abstract": "Receptor tyrosine kinases such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) stimulate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) to convert phosphaitydlinositol-4,5-bisphosophate [PtdIns(4,5)P2] into phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P3]. PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 then promotes various pathways leading to actin remodelling, changes in gene expression, and enhanced anabolic activity, cell survival and proliferation. In part, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 achieves these functions by stimulating the kinase Akt, which phosphorylates numerous targets like Tsc2 and GSK3{beta}. Overall, unchecked upregulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-Akt signalling can promote tumourgenesis and cancer progression. Interestingly, 50-70% of PtdIns and PtdInsPs have stearate and arachidonate at sn-1 and sn-2 positions of glycerol, respectively, forming a species known as 38:4-PtdIns/PtdInsPs. It is thought that LCLAT1/LYCAT and MBOAT7/LPIAT1 acyltransferases are respectively responsible for enriching PtdIns with this acyl composition. We previously showed that disruption of LCLAT1 altered the acyl profile of bis-phosphorylated PtdInsPs, lowered PtdIns(4,5)P2, and perturbed endocytosis and endocytic trafficking. However, the role of LCLAT1 in receptor tyrosine kinase and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 signaling was not explored. Here, we show that LCLAT1 silencing in MDA-MB-231 and ARPE-19 cells abated the levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in response to EGF signalling. Importantly, LCLAT1-silenced cells were also impaired for EGF-mediated Akt activation and downstream signalling, and consequently, were depressed for cell proliferation and survival. Thus, our work provides first evidence that the LCLAT1 acyltransferase supports receptor tyrosine kinase signalling through the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-Akt axis and may represent a novel target for therapeutic development against cancers.",

Genome wide association studies (GWAS) for coronary artery disease (CAD) have identified a risk locus at 11q22.3, and we have verified with fine mapping approaches that the regulatory variant rs2019090 and PDGFD represent the functional variant and putative functional gene. Further, FOXC1/C2 transcription factor (TF) binding at rs2019090 was found to promote PDGFD transcription through the CAD promoting allele. Employing a constitutive Pdgfd knockout allele along with SMC lineage tracing in a male atherosclerosis mouse model we mapped single cell transcriptomic, cell state, and lesion anatomical changes associated with gene loss. These studies revealed that Pdgfd promotes expansion, migration, and transition of SMC lineage cells to the chondromyocyte phenotype and vascular calcification. This is in contrast to protective CAD genes TCF21, ZEB2, and SMAD3 which we have shown to promote the fibroblast-like cell transition or perturb the pattern or extent of transition to the chondromyocyte phenotype. Further, Pdgfd expressing fibroblasts and pericytes exhibited greater expression of chemokines and leukocyte adhesion molecules, consistent with observed increased macrophage recruitment to the plaque. Despite these changes there was no effect of Pdgfd deletion on SMC contribution to the fibrous cap or overall lesion burden. These findings suggest that PDGFD mediates CAD risk through promoting SMC expansion and migration, in conjunction with deleterious phenotypic changes, and through promoting an inflammatory response that is primarily focused in the adventitia where it contributes to leukocyte trafficking to the diseased vessel wall.",

    "abstract": "Dental pain from apical periodontitis is an infection induced-orofacial pain condition that presents with diversity in pain phenotypes among patients. While 60% of patients with a full-blown disease present with the hallmark symptom of mechanical allodynia, nearly 40% of patients experience no pain. Furthermore, a sexual dichotomy exists, with females exhibiting lower mechanical thresholds under basal and diseased states. Finally, the prevalence of post-treatment pain refractory to commonly used analgesics ranges from 7-19% (~2 million patients), which warrants a thorough investigation of the cellular changes occurring in different patient cohorts. We, therefore, conducted a transcriptomic assessment of periapical biopsies (peripheral diseased tissue) from patients with persistent apical periodontitis. Surgical biopsies from symptomatic male (SM), asymptomatic male (AM), symptomatic female (SF), and asymptomatic female (AF) patients were collected and processed for bulk RNA sequencing. Using strict selection criteria, our study found several unique differentially regulated genes (DEGs) between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, as well as novel candidate genes between sexes within the same pain group. Specifically, we found the role of cells of the innate and adaptive immune system in mediating nociception in symptomatic patients and the role of genes involved in tissue homeostasis in potentially inhibiting nociception in asymptomatic patients. Furthermore, sex-related differences appear to be tightly regulated by macrophage activity, its secretome, and/or migration. Collectively, we present, for the first time, a comprehensive assessment of peripherally diseased human tissue after a microbial insult and shed important insights into the regulation of the trigeminal system in female and male patients.\n\nSummaryClinical diversity paves the way for translational research. We conducted a comprehensive transcriptomic assessment of peripherally diseased human tissue from patients with apical periodontitis to understand better clinical diversity observed in pain phenotypes between patients as well as perform in-depth analyses of sex-related dimorphism in patients with apical periodontitis.",

    "abstract": "Studying protein structures and dynamics directly in the cellular environments in which they function is essential to fully understand the molecular mechanisms underlying cellular processes. Site-directed spin-labeling (SDSL)--in combination with double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy--has emerged as a powerful technique for determining both the structural states and the conformational equilibria of biomacromolecules. In-cell DEER spectroscopy on proteins in mammalian cells has thus far not been possible due to the notable challenges of spin-labeling in live cells. In-cell SDSL requires exquisite biorthogonality, high labeling reaction rates and low background signal from unreacted residual spin label. While the bioorthogonal reaction must be highly specific and proceed under physiological conditions, many spin labels display time-dependent instability in the reducing cellular environment. Additionally, high concentrations of spin label can be toxic. Thus, an exceptionally fast bioorthogonal reaction is required that can allow for complete labeling with low concentrations of spin-label prior to loss of signal. Here we utilized genetic code expansion to site-specifically encode a novel family of small, tetrazine-bearing non-canonical amino acids (Tet-v4.0) at multiple sites in green fluorescent protein (GFP) and maltose binding protein (MBP) expressed both in E. coli and in human HEK293T cells. We achieved specific and quantitative spin-labeling of Tet-v4.0-containing proteins by developing a series of strained trans-cyclooctene (sTCO)-functionalized nitroxides--including a gem-diethyl-substituted nitroxide with enhanced stability in cells--with rate constants that can exceed 106 M-1 s-1. The remarkable speed of the Tet-v4.0/sTCO reaction allowed efficient spin-labeling of proteins in live HEK293T cells within minutes, requiring only sub-micromolar concentrations of sTCO-nitroxide added directly to the culture medium. DEER recorded from intact cells revealed distance distributions in good agreement with those measured from proteins purified and labeled in vitro. Furthermore, DEER was able to resolve the maltose-dependent conformational change of Tet-v4.0-incorporated and spin-labeled MBP in vitro and successfully discerned the conformational state of MBP within HEK293T cells. We anticipate the exceptional reaction rates of this system, combined with the relatively short and rigid side chains of the resulting spin labels, will enable structure/function studies of proteins directly in cells, without any requirements for protein purification.\n\nTOC\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=77 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/525763v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (21K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1251523org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18ee6ddorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d6d4b0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@259a53_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "A cyanobacterial photosynthetic biocomposite material was fabricated using 3D-printing and bioengineered to produce multiple functional outputs in response to an external chemical stimulus. Our investigations show the advantages of utilizing additive manufacturing techniques in controlling the design and shape of the fabricated materials, which proved to be important for the support and growth of obligate phototrophic microorganisms within the material. As an initial proof-of-concept, a synthetic theophylline-responsive riboswitch in Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 was used for regulating the expression of a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) reporter. Upon induction with theophylline, the encapsulated cells produced YFP within the hydrogel matrix. Subsequently, a strain of S. elongatus was engineered to produce an oxidative enzyme that is useful for bioremediation, laccase, expressed either constitutively or under the control of the riboswitch. The responsive biomaterial can decolorize a common textile dye pollutant, indigo carmine, potentially serving as a useful tool in environmental bioremediation. Finally, cells were engineered to have the capacity for inducible cell death to eliminate their presence once their activity is no longer required, which is an important function for biocontainment and minimizing unintended environmental impact. By integrating genetically engineered stimuli-responsive cyanobacteria in patterned volumetric 3D-printed designs, we demonstrate the potential of programmable photosynthetic biocomposite materials capable of producing functional outputs including, but not limited to, bioremediation.",

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common malignancies, and many studies have shown that PCa has a poor prognosis, which varies across different ethnicities. This variability is caused by genetic diversity. High-throughput omics technologies have identified and shed some light on the mechanisms of its progression and finding new biomarkers. Still, a systems biology approach is needed for a holistic molecular perspective. In this study, we applied a multi-omics approach to data analysis using different publicly available omics data sets from diverse populations to better understand the PCa disease etiology. Our study used multiple omic datasets, which included genomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic datasets, to identify drivers for PCa better. Individual omics datasets were analysed separately based on the standard pipeline for each dataset. Furthermore, we applied a novel multi-omics pathways algorithm to integrate all the individual omics datasets. This algorithm applies the p-values of enriched pathways from unique omics data types, which are then combined using the MiniMax statistic of the PathwayMultiomics tool to prioritise pathways dysregulated in the omics datasets. The single omics result indicated an association between up-regulated genes in RNA-Seq data and the metabolomics data. Glucose and pyruvate are the primary metabolites, and the associated pathways are glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, pyruvate kinase deficiency, and the Warburg effect pathway. From the interim result, the identified genes in RNA-Seq single omics analysis are linked with the significant pathways from the metabolomics analysis. The multi-omics pathway analysis will eventually enable the identification of biomarkers shared amongst these different omics datasets to ease prostate cancer prognosis.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWProtein representation learning has primarily benefited from the remarkable development of language models (LMs). Accordingly, pre-trained protein models also suffer from a problem in LMs: a lack of factual knowledge. The recent solution models the relationships between protein and associated knowledge terms as the knowledge encoding objective. However, it fails to explore the relationships at a more granular level, i.e., the token level. To mitigate this, we propose Knowledge-exploited Auto-encoder for Protein (KeAP), which performs tokenlevel knowledge graph exploration for protein representation learning. In practice, non-masked amino acids iteratively query the associated knowledge tokens to extract and integrate helpful information for restoring masked amino acids via attention. We show that KeAP can consistently outperform the previous counterpart on 9 representative downstream applications, sometimes surpassing it by large margins. These results suggest that KeAP provides an alternative yet effective way to perform knowledge enhanced protein representation learning.

    "abstract": "Conventional kinesin-1 is the primary anterograde motor in cells for transporting cellular cargo. While there is a consensus that the C-terminal tail of kinesin-1 inhibits motility, the molecular architecture of a full-length autoinhibited kinesin-1 remains unknown. Here, we combine cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS), electron microscopy (EM), and AlphaFold structure prediction to determine the architecture of the full-length autoinhibited kinesin-1 homodimer [kinesin-1 heavy chain (KHC)] and kinesin-1 heterotetramer [KHC bound to kinesin light chain 1 (KLC1)]. Our integrative analysis shows that kinesin-1 forms a compact, bent conformation through a break in coiled coil 3. Moreover, our XL-MS analysis demonstrates that kinesin light chains stabilize the folded inhibited state rather than inducing a new structural state. Using our structural model, we show that disruption of multiple interactions between the motor, stalk, and tail domains is required to activate the full-length kinesin-1. Our work offers a conceptual framework for understanding how cargo adaptors and microtubule-associated proteins relieve autoinhibition to promote activation.",

    "abstract": "Telomere length maintenance is crucial to cancer cell immortality. Up to 15% of cancers utilize a telomerase-independent, recombination-based mechanism termed alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). The primary ALT biomarker is the C-circle, a type of circular DNA with extrachromosomal telomere repeats (cECTRs). How C-circles form is not well characterized. To investigate C-circle formation in telomerase+ cells, we studied the human cen3tel cell line, in which telomeres progressively hyper-elongated post TERT-immortalization. cECTR signal was observed in 2D gels and C-circle assays but not t-circle assays, which also detect cECTRs. Telomerase activity and C-circle signal were not separable in the analysis of clonal populations, consistent with C-circle production occurring within telomerase+ cells. Two other long telomere, telomerase+ (LTT+) cell lines, HeLa1.3 (~23 kb telomeres) and HeLaE1 (~50 kb telomeres), had similar cECTR properties. Telomerase activity did not directly impact C-circle signal in LTT+ cells; instead, C-circle signal correlated with telomere length. LTT+ lines were less sensitive to hydroxyurea than an ALT+ cell line, suggesting that ALT status is a stronger contributor to replication stress levels than telomere length. Additionally, FANCM did not suppress C-circles in LTT+ cells as it does in ALT+ cells. Thus, C-circle formation may be driven by telomere length, independently of telomerase and replication stress, highlighting limitations of C-circles as a stand-alone ALT biomarker.",

    "abstract": "The sparse nature of single-cell omics data makes it challenging to dissect the wiring and rewiring of the transcriptional and signaling drivers that regulate cellular states. Many of the drivers, referred to as \"hidden drivers\", are difficult to identify via conventional expression analysis due to low expression and inconsistency between RNA and protein activity caused by post-translational and other modifications. To address this issue, we developed scMINER, a mutual information (MI)-based computational framework for unsupervised clustering analysis and cell-type specific inference of intracellular networks, hidden drivers and network rewiring from single-cell RNA-seq data. We designed scMINER to capture nonlinear cell-cell and gene-gene relationships and infer driver activities. Systematic benchmarking showed that scMINER outperforms popular single-cell clustering algorithms, especially in distinguishing similar cell types. With respect to network inference, scMINER does not rely on the binding motifs which are available for a limited set of transcription factors, therefore scMINER can provide quantitative activity assessment for more than 6,000 transcription and signaling drivers from a scRNA-seq experiment. As demonstrations, we used scMINER to expose hidden transcription and signaling drivers and dissect their regulon rewiring in immune cell heterogeneity, lineage differentiation, and tissue specification. Overall, activity-based scMINER is a widely applicable, highly accurate, reproducible and scalable method for inferring cellular transcriptional and signaling networks in each cell state from scRNA-seq data.

    "abstract": "Nociceptor neurons play a crucial role in maintaining the bodys equilibrium by detecting and responding to potential dangers in the environment. However, this function can be detrimental during allergic reactions, since vagal nociceptors can contribute to immune cell infiltration, bronchial hypersensitivity, and mucus imbalance, in addition to causing pain and coughing. Despite this, the specific mechanisms by which nociceptors acquire pro-inflammatory characteristics during allergic reactions are not yet fully understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the molecular profile of airway nociceptor neurons during allergic airway inflammation and identify the signals driving such reprogramming. Using retrograde tracing and lineage reporting, we identified a class of inflammatory vagal nociceptor neurons that exclusively innervate the airways. Using an ovalbumin mouse model of airway inflammation, we found that these neurons undergo significant reprogramming characterized by the upregulation of the NPY receptor Npy1r, along with Il6. A screening of asthma-driving cytokines revealed that IL-13 drives part of this reprogramming, including Npy1r overexpression via the JAK/STAT6 pathway, while IL-1{beta} induces IL-6 expression and release. Additionally, we observed that sympathetic neurons release NPY in the bronchoalveolar fluid of asthmatic mice, which limits the excitability of nociceptor neurons. In summary, allergic airway inflammation reprograms airway nociceptor neurons to acquire a pro-inflammatory phenotype, characterized by the release of IL-6, while a compensatory mechanism involving NPY1R limits nociceptor neurons activity.",

Here, we identified cellular rearrangements between acinar and ductal progenitors as a mechanism to drive branching morphogenesis in the pancreas while preserving the integrity of the acinar-ductal functional unit.\n\nUsing ex vivo and in vivo mouse models, we found that pancreatic ductal cells form clefts by protruding and pulling on the acinar basement membrane, which lead to acini splitting. Newly formed acini remain connected to bifurcated branches generated by ductal cell rearrangement. IGF/PI3K pathway regulates this process by controlling ductal cell fluidity. If components of the pathway are genetically or chemically dysregulated, ductal cell fluidity prevents branching and affects pancreatic cell fates. Hence, our results explain how acinar multiplication and branch bifurcation are synchronized during pancreas organogenesis.",

We dissected the signatures of observed lifespan differences by analyzing profiles of each strains proteome, lipidome, and metabolome under fermentative and respiratory culture conditions, which correspond to the metabolic states of replicative and chronologically aging cells, respectively. Examination of the relationships among extended longevity phenotypes, protein, and metabolite levels revealed that although many of these nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes carry out different functions, their inhibition attenuates a common mechanism that controls cytosolic ribosomal protein abundance, actin dynamics, and proteasome function to regulate lifespan. The principles of lifespan control learned through this work may be applicable to the regulation of lifespan in more complex organisms, since many aspects of mitochondrial function are highly conserved among eukaryotes.",

Here we link a high-quality de novo long read chromosomal assembly with epigenetic footprints and morphology to describe the Alpine dingo female named Cooinda. It was critical to establish an Alpine dingo reference because this ecotype occurs throughout coastal eastern Australia where the first drawings and descriptions were completed.\n\nFindingsWe generated a high-quality chromosome-level reference genome assembly (Canfam_ADS) using a combination of Pacific Bioscience, Oxford Nanopore, 10X Genomics, Bionano, and Hi-C technologies. Compared to the previously published Desert dingo assembly, there are large structural rearrangements on Chromosomes 11, 16, 25 and 26. Phylogenetic analyses of chromosomal data from Cooinda the Alpine dingo and nine previously published de novo canine assemblies show dingoes are monophyletic and basal to domestic dogs. Network analyses show that the mtDNA genome clusters within the southeastern lineage, as expected for an Alpine dingo. Comparison of regulatory regions identified two differentially methylated regions within glucagon receptor GCGR and histone deacetylase HDAC4 genes that are unmethylated in the Alpine dingo genome but hypermethylated in the Desert dingo. Morphological data, comprising geometric morphometric assessment of cranial morphology place dingo Cooinda within population-level variation for Alpine dingoes. Magnetic resonance imaging of brain tissue show she had a larger cranial capacity than a similar-sized domestic dog.\n\nConclusionsThese combined data support the hypothesis that the dingo Cooinda fits the spectrum of genetic and morphological characteristics typical of the Alpine ecotype. We propose that she be considered the archetype specimen for future research investigating the evolutionary history, morphology, physiology, and ecology of dingoes. The female has been taxidermically prepared and is now at the Australian Museum, Sydney.",

    "abstract": "Computational models provide an efficient paradigm for integrating and linking multiple spatial and temporal scales. However, these models are difficult to parameterize and match to experimental data. Recent advances in both data collection and model analyses have helped overcome this limitation. Here, we combine a multiscale, biventricular interaction model with mouse data before and after left ventricular (LV) ischemia. Sensitivity analyses are used to identify the most influential parameters on pressure and volume predictions. The subset of influential model parameters are calibrated to biventricular pressure-volume loop data (n=3) at baseline. Each mouse underwent left anterior descending coronary artery ligation, during which changes in fractional shortening and RV pressure-volume dynamics were recorded. Using the calibrated model, we simulate acute LV ischemia and contrast outputs at baseline and in simulated ischemia. Our baseline simulations align with the LV and RV data, and our predictions during ischemia complement recorded RV data and prior studies on LV function during myocardial infarction. We show that a model with both biventricular mechanical interaction and systems level cardiovascular dynamics can quantitatively reproduce in-vivo data and qualitatively match prior findings from animal studies on LV ischemia.",

    "abstract": "The organization of the cytokinetic ring at the cell equator of dividing animal and fungi cells depends crucially on the anillin scaffold proteins. In fission yeast, anillin related Mid1 binds to the plasma membrane and helps anchor and organize a medial broad band of cytokinetic nodes, which are the precursors of the contractile ring. Similar to other anillins, Mid1 contains a C terminal globular domain with two potential regions for membrane binding, the Pleckstrin Homology (PH) and C2 domains, and an N terminal intrinsically disordered region that is strongly regulated by phosphorylation. Previous studies have shown that both PH and C2 domains can associate with the membrane, preferring phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) lipids. However, it is unclear if they can simultaneously bind to the membrane in a way that allows dimerization or oligomerization of Mid1, and if one domain plays a dominant role. To elucidate Mid1s membrane binding mechanism, we used the available structural information of the C terminal region of Mid1 in all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) near a membrane with a lipid composition based on experimental measurements (including PIP2 lipids). The disordered L3 loop of C2, as well as the PH domain, separately bind the membrane through charged lipid contacts. In simulations with the full C terminal region started away from the membrane, Mid1 binds through the L3 loop and is stabilized in a vertical orientation with the PH domain away from the membrane. However, a configuration with both C2 and PH initially bound to the membrane remains associated with the membrane. These multiple modes of binding may reflect Mid1s multiple interactions with membranes and other node proteins, and ability to sustain mechanical forces.",

Tau forms large insoluble aggregates that are toxic to neurons in several neurological disorders and neurofibrillary Tau tangles represent a key pathological hallmark of Alzheimers disease (AD) and other  tauopathies1,2. Several Tau-lowering strategies are being investigated as a potential treatment for AD but the mechanisms that regulate Tau expression at the transcriptional or translational level are not well understood3,4. Recently, Simone et al.5 reported the discovery of a new type of natural antisense transcripts called  MIR-NATs (referring to Mammalian-wide Interspersed Repeats - Natural Antisense Transcripts). Simone and colleagues used MAPT-AS1, a MIR-NAT associated to the MAPT gene as an archetype of this new class of long non-coding RNAs. According to Simone et al., MAPT-AS1 represses Tau translation by competing for ribosomal RNA. We investigated the potential functions of MAPT-AS1 in neurons using the same gain- and loss-of-function experiments as described in the original report and expanded our analysis with complementary approaches. Our data do not support a role for MAPT-AS1 in regulating Tau expression in human neurons and urge to cautiously interpret the data provided by Simone et al.5.",

    "abstract": "Ophioviruses (genus Ophiovirus, family Aspiviridae) are plant-infecting viruses with non-enveloped, filamentous, naked nucleocapsid virions. Members of genus Ophiovirus have a segmented single-stranded negative-sense RNA genome (ca. 11.3-12.5 kb), encompassing three or four linear segments. These segments encode in total four to seven proteins in sense and antisense orientation, both in the viral and complementary strands. The genus Ophiovirus includes seven species with viruses infecting both monocots and dicots, mostly trees, shrubs and some ornamentals. From a genomic perspective, as of today, there are complete genomes available for only four species. Here, by exploring large metatranscriptomics publicly available datasets, we report the identification and molecular characterization of 33 novel viruses with genetic and evolutionary cues of ophioviruses. Genetic distance and evolutionary insights suggest that all the detected viruses could correspond to members of novel species, which expand ca. 4.5-fold the current diversity of ophioviruses. The detected viruses increase the tentative host range of ophioviruses for the first time to mosses, liverwort and ferns. In addition, viruses were linked to several Asteraceae, Orchidaceae and Poaceae crops/ornamental plants. Phylogenetic analyses showed a novel clade of mosses, liverworts and fern ophioviruses, characterized by long branches suggesting still plenty unsampled hidden diversity within the genus. This study represents a significant expansion of genomics of ophioviruses, opening the grounds to future works on the molecular and evolutionary peculiarity of this virus genus.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) are devastating conditions of the gastrointestinal tract with limited treatments, and dietary intervention may be effective, and affordable, for managing symptoms. Glucosinolate compounds are highly concentrated in broccoli sprouts, especially glucoraphanin, and can be metabolized by certain mammalian gut bacteria into anti inflammatory isothiocyanates, such as sulforaphane. Gut microbiota exhibit biogeographic patterns, but it is unknown if colitis alters these or whether the location of glucoraphanin metabolizing bacteria affects anti-inflammatory benefits. We fed specific pathogen free C57BL/6 mice either a control diet or a 10% steamed broccoli sprout diet, and gave a three-cycle regimen of 2.5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in drinking water over a 34-day experiment to simulate chronic, relapsing ulcerative colitis. We monitored body weight, fecal characteristics, lipocalin, serum cytokines, and bacterial communities from the luminal and mucosa-associated populations in the jejunum, cecum, and colon. Mice fed the broccoli sprout diet with DSS treatment performed better than mice fed the control diet with DSS, including significantly more weight gain, lower Disease Activity Indexes, lower plasma lipocalin and proinflammatory cytokines, and higher bacterial richness in all gut locations. Bacterial communities were assorted by gut location, but were more homogenous across locations in the control diet + DSS mice. Importantly, our results showed that broccoli sprout feeding abrogated the effects of DSS on gut microbiota, as bacterial richness and biogeography were similar between mice receiving broccoli sprouts with and without DSS. Collectively, these results support the protective effect of steamed broccoli sprouts against dysbiosis and colitis induced by DSS.\n\nImportanceEvaluating bacterial communities across different locations in the gut provides a greater insight than fecal samples alone, and provides an additional metric by which to evaluate beneficial host-microbe interactions. Here, we show that 10% steamed broccoli sprouts in the diet protects mice from the negative effects of dextran sodium sulfate induced colitis, that colitis erases biogeographical patterns of bacterial communities in the gut, and that the cecum is not likely to be a significant contributor to colonic bacteria of interest in the DSS mouse model of ulcerative colitis. Mice fed the broccoli sprout diet during colitis performed better than mice fed the control diet while receiving DSS. The identification of accessible dietary components and concentrations that help maintain and correct the gut microbiome may provide universal and equitable approaches to IBD prevention and recovery, and broccoli sprouts represent a promising strategy.",

    "abstract": "Retinoic acid inducible gene I (Rig-I) is a cytosolic pattern recognition receptor canonically described for its important role in sensing viral RNAs. Increasingly, bacterially-derived RNA from intracellular bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, have been shown to activate the same host Rig-I/Mitochondrial antiviral sensing protein (MAVS) signaling pathway to drive a type-I interferon response that contributes to bacterial pathogenesis in vivo. In M. tuberculosis, this response is mediated by the protein secretion system SecA2, but little is known about whether this process is conserved in other pathogenic mycobacteria or the mechanism by which these nucleic acids gain access to the host cytoplasm. Because the M. tuberculosis and M. marinum SecA2 protein secretion systems share a high degree of genetic and functional conservation, we hypothesized that Rig-I/MAVS activation and subsequent induction of IFN-{beta} secretion by host macrophages will also be conserved between these two mycobacterial species. To test this, we generated a {Delta}secA2 M. marinum strain along with complementation strains expressing either the M. marinum or M. tuberculosis secA2 genes. Our results suggest that the {Delta}secA2 strain has a growth defect in vitro but not in host macrophages. These intracellular growth curves also suggested that the calculation applied to estimate the number of bacteria added to macrophage monolayers in infection assays underestimates bacterial inputs for the {Delta}secA2 strain. Therefore, to better examine secreted IFN-{beta} levels when bacterial infection levels are equal across strains, we plated bacterial CFUs at 2hpi alongside our ELISA based infections. This enabled us to normalize secreted levels of IFN-{beta} to a standard number of bacteria. Applying this approach to both WT and MAVS-/- bone marrow derived macrophages we observed equal or higher levels of secreted IFN-{beta} from macrophages infected with the {Delta}secA2 M. marinum strain as compared to WT. Together our findings suggest that activation of host Rig-I/MAVS cytosolic sensors and subsequent induction of IFN-{beta} response in a SecA2-dependent manner is not conserved in M. marinum under the conditions tested.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to test the idea that human gene promoters have evolved to be resistant to the effects of mutations in their primary function, the control of gene expression. It is proposed that the transcription factor/transcription factor binding site (TF/TFBS) pair having the greatest effect on control of a gene is the one with the highest abundance in the promoter. Other pairs would have the same effect on gene expression and would predominate in the event of a mutation in the most abundant pair. It is expected that the overall promoter architecture proposed here will be highly resistant to mutagenic change that would otherwise affect expression of the gene. The idea was tested beginning with a database of 42 human genes highly specific for expression in brain. For each gene, information was accumulated about its expression level and about the TFBS occupancy of the five most abundant TF/TFBS pairs. Expression level was then plotted against TFBS occupancy separately for each of the five pairs, and the plots were compared with each other. The plots were found to be similar, and the results were interpreted to indicate that the TFBS occupancy ranks evolved to yield the same effect on gene expression level with multiple ranks able to function in the event of mutation in another. A similar analysis was conducted with a database of 31 human liver specific genes, and the overall result was found to be the same. Backup TFBS occupancy ranks were interpreted to be present in both brain and liver specific genes. Finally, the TFBSs in the brain specific and liver specific gene populations were compared with each other with the goal of identifying any brain selective or liver selective TFBSs. Of the 89 TFBSs in the pooled population, 58 were found only in brain specific but not liver specific genes, 8 only in liver specific but not brain specific genes and 23 were found in both brain and liver specific genes. The results were interpreted to emphasize the large number of TFBS in brain specific but not liver specific genes.",

    "abstract": "Trypanosomatids are single-cell eukaryotic parasites. Unlike higher eukaryotes, they control gene expression posttranscriptionally and not at the level of transcription initiation. This involves all known cellular RNA circuits, from mRNA processing to mRNA decay to translation, in addition to a large panel of RNA-interacting proteins that modulate mRNA abundance. However, other forms of gene regulation, for example, by lncRNAs, cannot be excluded. LncRNAs are poorly studied in trypanosomatids, with only a single lncRNA characterized today. Furthermore, it is not clear whether the complete inventory of trypanosomatid lncRNAs is known because of the inherent cDNA recoding and DNA amplification limitations of short-read RNA sequencing. Here we overcome these limitations by using long-read direct RNA sequencing (DRS) on nanopore arrays. We analyze the native RNA pool of the two main lifecycle stages of the African trypanosome T. brucei with a special emphasis on the inventory of lncRNAs. We identify 207 previously unknown lncRNAs, 109 of which are stage-specifically expressed. We also present insights into the complexity of the T. brucei transcriptome, including alternative transcriptional start and stop sites and potential transcript isoforms to provide a bias-free understanding of the intricate RNA landscape in T. brucei.",

    "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a liver manifestation of metabolic syndrome, and is estimated to affect one billion individuals worldwide. An increased intake of a high-fat diet (HFD) and sugar-sweetened beverages are risk-factors for NAFLD development, but how their combined intake promotes progression to a more severe form of liver injury is unknown. Here we show that fructose metabolism via ketohexokinase (KHK) C isoform increases endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in a dose dependent fashion, so when fructose is coupled with a HFD intake it leads to unresolved ER stress. Conversely, a liver-specific knockdown of KHK in C57BL/6J male mice consuming fructose on a HFD is adequate to improve the NAFLD activity score and exert a profound effect on the hepatic transcriptome. Overexpression of KHK-C in cultured hepatocytes is sufficient to induce ER stress in fructose free media. Upregulation of KHK-C is also observed in genetically obesity ob/ob, db/db and lipodystrophic FIRKO male mice, whereas KHK knockdown in these mice improves metabolic function. Additionally, in over 100 inbred strains of male or female mice hepatic KHK expression correlates positively with adiposity, insulin resistance, and liver triglycerides. Similarly, in 241 human subjects and their controls, hepatic Khk expression is upregulated in early, but not late stages of NAFLD. In summary, we describe a novel role of KHK-C in triggering ER stress, which offers a mechanistic understanding of how the combined intake of fructose and a HFD propagates the development of metabolic complications.",

STIM2 mediated Store-Operated Ca2+ Entry (SOCE) regulates cytosolic and ER Ca2+ concentrations, stabilizes dendritic spine formation and drives presynaptic spontaneous transmission and ER stress in neurons. Recently identified alternative spliced variants expand the STIM protein repertoire, uncover unique functions and facilitate our understanding of tissue specific regulation of SOCE. Here, we describe an addition to this repertoire, a unique short STIM2 variant (STIM2.3/STIM2G) present only in old world monkeys and humans with expression in humans starting with the beginning of brainwave activity and upon synapse formation within the cerebral cortex. In contrast to the short STIM1B variant, STIM2.3/STIM2G increases SOCE upon stimulation independently of specific spliced in residues. Basal cluster formation is reduced and analyses of several additional deletion and point mutations delineate the role of functional motifs for Ca2+ entry, NFAT activation and changes in neuronal gene expression. In addition, STIM2.3/STIM2G shows reduced binding and activation of the energy sensor AMPK. In the context of reduced STIM2.3 splicing seen in postmortem brains of patients with Huntingtons disease, our data suggests that STIM2.3/STIM2G is an important regulator of neuronal Ca2+ homeostasis, potentially involved in synapse formation/maintenance and evolutionary expansion of brain complexity.",

Using long term in vivo two-photon imaging of zebrafish transgenic lines and automated image processing tools, we provide a method to reconstruct the r2-r6 lineage trees from the onset of gastrulation through early neurulation. We provide a dynamic fate map of hindbrain patterning at single-cell resolution. We show that rhombomere progenitor domains are aligned along the anteroposterior (AP) and dorsoventral (DV) axes as early as the shield stage. Rhombomere progenitor domains show a segmental organization, parallel to the blastoderm margin that predicts the future AP order of hindbrain. The DV organization of rhombomeres is set by the segregation of the progenitors along the DV axis of the embryo. Progenitors located at the dorsal/medial part of the blastoderm form the ventral domain of the rhombomeres while the lateral progenitors constitute the dorsal part. Our study sheds light on the clonal origin of individual rhombomeres, spatial and temporal patterns of cell division and migration of rhombomere progenitors throughout the early steps of hindbrain morphogenesis.",

A-P axis elongation can also be reproduced in 3D cell culture models termed gastruloids, enabling dissection of this process in a controlled, minimal context. Here, we set out to determine how gastruloid posterior elongation depends on the Erk and Akt pathways, canonical downstream effectors of FGF signaling. We find that gastruloids exhibit reproducible posterior-to-anterior gradients in Erk and Akt phosphorylation that are generated independently and correlate with distinct zones of tissue movement, cell proliferation, and expression of cell motility and adhesion regulators. Pharmacological inhibition of FGFR, Erk, or Akt signaling impairs gastruloid elongation, and quantification of signaling gradients reveals how these patterns interact and scale with A-P axis length. Using global inhibitors and activators of each pathway, we find that a gradient of Ras/Erk signaling is required for the establishment of appropriately localized domains of E-cadherin, Snail, and Brachyury expression, whereas perturbing PI3K/Akt signaling alters proliferation but not patterning. Taken together, our data demonstrate that graded PI3K/Akt and Ras/Erk signaling provide spatial information to control proliferation and cell-cell adhesion during gastruloid elongation.",

    "abstract": "Midbrain dopaminergic neurons (mDANs) control voluntary movement, cognition, and reward behavior under physiological conditions and are implicated in human diseases such as Parkinsons disease (PD). Many transcription factors (TFs) controlling human mDAN differentiation during development have been described, but much of the regulatory landscape remains undefined. Using a tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) iPSC reporter line, we have generated time series transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles of purified mDANs during differentiation. Integrative analysis predicted novel central regulators of mDAN differentiation and super-enhancers were used to prioritize key TFs. We find LBX1, NHLH1 and NR2F1/2 to be necessary for mDAN differentiation and show that overexpression of either LBX1 or NHLH1 can also improve mDAN specification. NHLH1 is necessary for the induction of neuronal miR-124, while LBX1 regulates cholesterol biosynthesis, possibly through mTOR signaling. Consistently, rapamycin treatment led to an inhibition of mDAN differentiation. Thus, our work reveals novel regulators of human mDAN differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Cnidarians exhibit incredible reproductive diversity, with most capable of sexual and asexual reproduction. Here we investigate factors that influence asexual reproduction in the burrowing sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, which can propagate asexually by transverse fission of the body column. By altering culture conditions, we demonstrate that the presence of a burrowing substrate strongly promotes transverse fission. In addition, we show that animal size does not affect fission rates, and that the plane of fission is fixed along the oral-aboral axis of the polyp. Homeobox transcription factors and components of the TGF{beta}, Notch, and FGF signaling pathways are differentially expressed in polyps undergoing physal pinching suggesting they are important regulators of transverse fission. Gene ontology analyses further suggest that during transverse fission the cell cycle is suppressed and that cell adhesion and patterning mechanisms are downregulated to promote separation of the body column. Finally, we demonstrate that the rate of asexual reproduction is sensitive to population density. Collectively, these experiments provide a foundation for mechanistic studies of asexual reproduction in Nematostella, with implications for understanding the reproductive and regenerative biology of other cnidarian species.",

Downfield metabolite maps with a nominal spatial resolution of 0.7 cm3 were recorded in 8 slices at 3T in a scan time of 22m 40s. An MRSI post-processing pipeline was developed to create DF metabolite maps.

While DF concentration maps were visually quite homogeneous throughout the brain, general linear regression analysis corrected for multiple comparisons found significant differences between CSO and DLPFC for peaks at 7.09 ppm (p= 0.014), 7.90 ppm (p=0.009), 8.18 ppm (p=0.009), combined amides (p=0.009), and between ACC and DLPFC for the 7.30 ppm peak (p=0.020).

While the former option might lead to experiments closer to industrial conditions, the latter has the advantage of allowing for reproducibility and comparability of results among different laboratories, as well as being suitable for the investigation of how different individual components affect microbial or process performance. It is undoubtable that the development of a synthetic must a few decades ago led to important advances in wine yeast research.\n\nResultsWe developed a fully defined medium that mimics sugarcane molasses, a frequently used medium in different industrial processes where yeast is cultivated. The medium, named 2SMol, builds upon a previously published semi-defined formulation and is conveniently prepared from some stock solutions: C-source, organic N, inorganic N, organic acids, trace elements, vitamins, Mg+K, and Ca. We validated the 2SMol recipe in a scaled-down sugarcane biorefinery model, comparing the performance of different yeast strains in different real molasses-based media. We also showcase the flexibility of the medium by investigating the effect of nitrogen availability on the ethanol yield during fermentation.\n\nConclusionsHere we present in detail the development of a fully defined synthetic molasses medium, and we hope the 2SMol formulation will be valuable to researchers both in academia and industry to obtain new insights and developments in industrial yeast biotechnology.",

    "abstract": "The cation-permeable TRPV2 channel is essential for cardiac and immune cells. Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive cannabinoid of clinical relevance, is one of the few molecules known to activate TRPV2. Using the patch-clamp technique we discover that CBD can sensitize current responses of the rat TRPV2 channel to the synthetic agonist 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2- APB) by over two orders of magnitude, without sensitizing channels to activation by moderate (40 C) heat. Using cryo-EM we uncover a new small-molecule binding site in the pore domain of rTRPV2 that can be occupied by CBD in addition to a nearby CBD site that had already been reported. The TRPV1 and TRPV3 channels share >40% sequence identity with TRPV2 are also activated by 2-APB and CBD, but we only find a strong sensitizing effect of CBD on the response of mouse TRPV3 to 2-APB. Mutations at non-conserved positions between rTRPV2 and rTRPV1 in either the pore domain or the CBD sites failed to confer strong sensitization by CBD in mutant rTRPV1 channels. Together, our results indicate that CBD-dependent sensitization of TRPV2 channels engages multiple channel regions and possibly involves more than one CBD and 2-APB sites. The remarkably robust effect of CBD on TRPV2 and TRPV3 channels offers a promising new tool to both understand and overcome one of the major roadblocks in the study of these channels - their resilience to activation.",

    "abstract": "Aneuploidy is a hallmark of human cancer, yet the cellular mechanisms that allow cells to cope with aneuploidy-induced cellular stresses remain largely unknown. Such coping mechanisms may present cellular vulnerabilities that can be harnessed for targeting cancer cells. Here, we induced aneuploidy in non-transformed RPE1-hTERT cells and derived multiple stable clones with various degrees of chromosome imbalances. We performed an unbiased genomic profiling of 6 isogenic clones, using whole-exome and RNA sequencing. We then functionally interrogated their cellular dependency landscapes, using genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens and large-scale drug screens. We found that aneuploid clones activated the DNA damage response (DDR), and were consequently more resistant to further DNA damage induction. Interestingly, aneuploid cells also exhibited elevated RAF/MEK/ERK pathway activity, and were more sensitive to several clinically-relevant drugs targeting this pathway, and in particular to genetic and chemical CRAF inhibition. CRAF activity was functionally linked to the resistance to DNA damage induction, as CRAF inhibition sensitized aneuploid cells to DNA damage-inducing chemotherapies. The association between aneuploidy, RAF/MEK/ERK signaling, and DDR was independent of p53. The increased activity and dependency of aneuploid cells on the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway was validated in another isogenic aneuploid system, and across hundreds of human cancer cell lines, confirming their relevance to human cancer. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive resource for genetically-matched karyotypically-stable cells of various aneuploidy states, and reveals a novel therapeutically-relevant cellular dependency of aneuploid cells.",

    "abstract": "Aneuploidy, an abnormal chromosome composition, results in a stoichiometric imbalance of protein complexes, which jeopardizes the fitness of aneuploid cells. Aneuploid cells thus need to compensate for the imbalanced DNA levels by regulating their RNA and protein levels, a phenomenon known as dosage compensation. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in dosage compensation in human cells - and whether they can be targeted to selectively kill aneuploid cancer cells - remain unknown. Here, we addressed this question via molecular dissection of multiple diploid vs. aneuploid cell models. Using genomic and functional profiling of a novel isogenic system of RPE1-hTERT cells with various degrees of aneuploidy, we found that aneuploid cells cope with both transcriptional burden and proteotoxic stress. At the mRNA level, aneuploid cells increased RNA synthesis, but concomitantly elevated several RNA degradation pathways, in particular the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) and the microRNA-mediated mRNA silencing pathways. Consequently, aneuploid cells were more sensitive to the genetic or chemical perturbation of several key components of these RNA degradation pathways. At the protein level, aneuploid cells experienced proteotoxic stress, resulting in reduced translation and increased protein degradation, rendering them more sensitive to proteasome inhibition. These findings were recapitulated across hundreds of human cancer cell lines and primary tumors, confirming that both non-transformed and transformed cells alter their RNA and protein metabolism in order to adapt to the aneuploid state. Our results reveal that aneuploid cells are dependent on the over- or under-activation of several nodes along the gene expression process, identifying these pathways as clinically-actionable vulnerabilities of aneuploid cells.",

LS is a multi-system disorder with severe neurologic, metabolic, and musculoskeletal symptoms. The presence of progressive, symmetric, necrotizing lesions in the brainstem are a defining feature of the disease, and the major cause of morbidity and mortality, but the mechanisms underlying their pathogenesis have been elusive. Recently, we demonstrated that high-dose pexidartinib, a CSF1R inhibitor, prevents LS CNS lesions and systemic disease in the Ndufs4(-/-) mouse model of LS. While the dose-response in this study implicated peripheral immune cells, the immune populations involved have not yet been elucidated. Here, we used a targeted genetic tool, deletion of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) macrophage super-enhancer FIRE (Csf1r{Delta}FIRE), to specifically deplete microglia and define the role of microglia in the pathogenesis of LS. Homozygosity for the Csf1r{Delta}FIRE allele ablates microglia in both control and Ndufs4(-/-) animals, but onset of CNS lesions and sequalae in the Ndufs4(-/-), including mortality, are only marginally impacted by microglia depletion. The overall development of necrotizing CNS lesions is not altered, though microglia remain absent. Finally, histologic analysis of brainstem lesions provides direct evidence of a causal role for peripheral macrophages in the characteristic CNS lesions. These data demonstrate that peripheral macrophages play a key role in the pathogenesis disease in the Ndufs4(-/-) model.",

    "abstract": "Whilst the majority of PD cases are sporadic, much of our understanding of the pathophysiological basis of disease can be traced back to the study of rare, monogenic forms of disease. In the past decade, the availability of Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) has facilitated a shift in focus, toward identifying common risk variants conferring increased risk of developing PD across the population. A recent mitophagy screening assay of GWAS candidates has functionally implicated the non-specific lethal (NSL) complex in the regulation of PINK1-mitophagy. Here, a bioinformatics approach has been taken to investigate the proteome of the NSL complex, to unpick its relevance to PD progression. The mitochondrial NSL interactome has been built, mining 3 separate repositories: PINOT, HIPPIE and MIST, for curated, literature-derived protein-protein interaction (PPI) data. We built; i) the  mitochondrial interactome, applying gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to explore the relevance of the NSL mitochondrial interactome to PD and, ii) the PD-oriented interactome to uncover biological pathways underpinning the NSL /PD association. In this study, we find the mitochondrial NSL interactome to be significantly enriched for the protein products of PD associated genes, including the Mendelian PD genes LRRK2 and VPS35. Additionally, the PD associated interactome is enriched for mitochondrial processes; \"mitochondrial cell death\", \"mitochondrial protein localisation\", \"membrane protein localisation\" and \"mitochondrial transport\". Our data points to NSL complex members OGT and WDR5 as key drivers of this increased PD association. These findings strengthen a role for mitochondrial quality control in both familial and sporadic disease.",

The syncytial respiratory virus factories include gene function proteins, brought together by the phosphoprotein (P) RNA polymerase cofactor, present across non-segmented negative stranded RNA viruses. Homotypic liquid-liquid phase separation of RSV-P is governed by an -helical molten globule domain, and strongly self-downmodulated by adjacent sequences. Condensation of P with the nucleoprotein N is stoichiometrically tuned, defining aggregate-droplet and droplet-dissolution boundaries. Time course analysis show small N-P nuclei gradually coalescing into large granules in transfected cells. This behavior is recapitulated in infection, with small puncta evolving to large viral factories, strongly suggesting that P-N nucleation-condensation sequentially drives viral factories. Thus, the tendency of P to undergo phase separation is moderate and latent in the full-length protein but unleashed in the presence of N or when neighboring disordered sequences are deleted. This, together with its capacity to rescue nucleoprotein-RNA aggregates suggests a role as a \"solvent-protein\" and possible fluidity tuner of viral factories.",

    "abstract": "Mutation of the GABRA1 gene is associated with neurodevelopmental defects and epilepsy phenotypes. GABRA1 encodes for the 1 subunit of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABAAR), which regulates the fast inhibitory impulses of the nervous system. Multiple model systems have previously been developed to understand the mechanism by which mutations in GABRA1 cause disease, but these models have produced complex and incongruent data. Thus, additional model systems are required to validate and substantiate previously published results. We investigated the behavioral patterns associated with a non-sense mutation of the zebrafish gabra1 (sa43718 allele) gene. The sa43718 allele has a 90% decrease in total gabra1 mRNA expression, which is associated with light induced seizure-like behavior. Mutation of gabra1 was accompanied by increased mRNA expression of gabra4, which encodes for the alpha-4 subunit of the GABAAR. Despite increased expression at the RNA level, Gabra4 protein was not increased according to proteomics analysis. Thus, implying that RNA expression patterns of alpha sub-units may not accurately reflect the mechanism underlying seizure. Interestingly, proteomics analysis identified significant enrichment of genes that regulate proton transport, ion homeostasis, vesicle transport, and mitochondrial protein complexes. Collectively, our analysis validates that mutation of gabra1 results in seizure like phenotypes and provides a blueprint of putative proteins which may mediate these phenotypes in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to excess glucocorticoid (GC) during early development is implicated in adult dysfunctions. Reduced adult hippocampal neurogenesis is a well-known consequence of exposure to early life stress or elevated GC, however the effects on neurogenesis during development and effects on other brain regions are not well understood. Using an optogenetic zebrafish model, here we analysed the effects of GC exposure on neurogenesis during development in the whole brain. We identify that the hypothalamus is a highly GC-sensitive region where elevated GC causes precocious development. This is followed by failed maturation and early decline accompanied by impaired feeding, growth, and longevity. In GC-exposed animals, the developmental trajectory of hypothalamic progenitor cells is strikingly altered, potentially mediated by direct regulation of transcription factors such as rx3 by GC. Our data provide cellular and molecular level insight into GC-induced alteration of the hypothalamic development trajectory, a process crucial for health across the life-course.",

    "abstract": "Brain function relies on communication via neuronal synapses. Neurons build and diversify synaptic contacts using different protein combinations that define the specificity, function and plasticity potential of synapses. More than a thousand proteins have been globally identified in both pre- and postsynaptic compartments, providing substantial potential for synaptic diversity. While there is ample evidence of diverse synaptic structures, states or functional properties, the diversity of the underlying individual synaptic proteomes remains largely unexplored. Here we used 7 different Cre-driver mouse lines crossed with a floxed mouse line in which the presynaptic terminals were fluorescently labeled (SypTOM) to identify the proteomes that underlie synaptic diversity. We combined microdissection of 5 different brain regions with fluorescent-activated synaptosome sorting to isolate and analyze using quantitative mass spectrometry 18 types of synapses and their underlying synaptic proteomes. We discovered ~1800 unique synapse type-enriched proteins and allocated thousands of proteins to different types of synapses. We identify commonly shared synaptic protein modules and highlight the hotspots for proteome specialization. A protein-protein correlation network classifies proteins into modules and their association with synaptic traits reveals synaptic protein communities that correlate with either neurotransmitter glutamate or GABA. Finally, we reveal specializations and commonalities of the striatal dopaminergic proteome and outline the proteome diversity of synapses formed by parvalbumin, somatostatin and vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing cortical interneuron subtypes, highlighting proteome signatures that relate to their functional properties. This study opens the door for molecular systems-biology analysis of synapses and provides a framework to integrate proteomic information for synapse subtypes of interest with cellular or circuit-level experiments.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian specification of mesoderm and definitive endoderm (DE) is instructed by the two related Tbx transcription factors (TFs) Eomesodermin (Eomes) and Brachyury sharing partially redundant functions. Gross differences of mutant embryonic phenotypes suggest specific functions of each TF. To date, the molecular details of separated lineage-specific gene-regulation by Eomes and Brachyury remain poorly understood. Here, we combine embryonic and stem cell-based analyses to delineate the non-overlapping, lineage-specific transcriptional activities. On a genome-wide scale binding of both TFs overlaps at promoters of target genes, but shows specificity for distal enhancer regions, that is conferred by differences in Tbx DNA-binding motifs. The unique binding to enhancer sites instructs the specification of anterior mesoderm (AM) and DE by Eomes and caudal mesoderm by Brachyury. Remarkably, EOMES antagonizes BRACHYURY gene-regulatory functions in co-expressing cells during early gastrulation to ensure the proper sequence of early AM and DE lineage specification followed by posterior mesoderm derivatives.\n\nHighlightsO_LIDetailed comparative analysis of the two critical developmental regulators Eomes and Brachyury in mouse embryos and differentiating embryonic stem cells\nC_LIO_LITbx factors EOMES and BRACHYURY control distinct gene programs to specify different mesoderm and endoderm subsets\nC_LIO_LIProgram specificity is conferred by binding to non-overlapping enhancers with distinct binding motifs\nC_LIO_LIEOMES restricts the activities of BRACHYURY thus ensuring the proper sequence of mesoderm and endoderm lineage specification\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Dendritic spines host glutamatergic excitatory synapses and compartmentalize biochemical signalling underlying synaptic plasticity. The narrow spine neck that connects the spine head with its parent dendrite is the crucial structural element of this compartmentalization. Both neck morphology and its molecular composition differentially regulate exchange of molecular signals between the spine and rest of the neuron. Although these spine neck properties themselves show activity-dependent plasticity, it remains unclear what functional role spine neck plasticity plays in synaptic plasticity expression. To address this, we built a data-constrained biophysical computational model of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) trafficking and intracellular signalling involving Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and the phosphatase calcineurin in hippocampal CA1 neurons, which provides new mechanistic insights into spatiotemporal AMPAR dynamics during long-term potentiation (LTP). Using the model, we tested how plasticity of neck morphology and of neck septin7 barrier, which specifically restricts membrane protein diffusion, affect LTP. We found that spine neck properties control LTP by regulating the balance between AMPAR and calcineurin escape from the spine. Neck plasticity that increases spine-dendrite coupling reduces LTP by allowing more AMPA receptors to diffuse away from the synapse. Surprisingly, neck plasticity that decreases spine-dendrite coupling can also reduce LTP by trapping calcineurin, which dephosphorylates AMPARs. Further simulations showed that the precise timescale of neck plasticity, relative to AMPAR and enzyme diffusion and phosphorylation dynamics, critically regulates LTP. These results suggest a new mechanistic and experimentally-testable theory for how spine neck plasticity regulates synaptic plasticity.",
