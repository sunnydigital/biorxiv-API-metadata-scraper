    "abstract": "Upon the secondary contact of populations, speciation with gene flow is greatly facilitated when the same pleiotropic loci are both subject to divergent ecological selection and induce non-random mating, leading to loci with this fortuitous combination of functions being referred to as \"magic trait\" loci. We use a population genetics model to examine whether \"pseudomagic trait\" complexes, composed of physically linked loci fulfilling these two functions, are as efficient in promoting premating isolation as magic traits. We specifically measure the evolution of choosiness, which controls the strength of assortative mating. We show that, surprisingly, pseudomagic trait complexes, and to a lesser extent also physically unlinked loci, can lead to the evolution of considerably stronger assortative mating preferences than do magic traits, provided polymorphism at the involved loci is maintained. This is because assortative mating preferences are generally favored when there is a risk of producing maladapted recombinants, as occurs with nonmagic trait complexes but not with magic traits (since pleiotropy precludes recombination). Contrary to current belief, magic traits may not be the most effective genetic architecture for promoting strong premating isolation. Distinguishing between magic traits and pseudomagic trait complexes is therefore important when inferring their role in premating isolation. This calls for further fine-scale genomic research on speciation genes.",

    "abstract": "What causes evolution to be repeatable is a fundamental question in evolutionary biology. Pleiotropy, i.e. the effect of an allele on multiple traits, is thought to enhance repeatability by constraining the number of available beneficial mutations. Additionally, pleiotropy may promote repeatability by allowing large fitness benefits of single mutations via adaptive combinations of phenotypic effects. Yet, this latter evolutionary potential may be reaped solely by specific types of mutations able to realize optimal combinations of phenotypic effects while avoiding the costs of pleiotropy. Here, we address the interaction of gene pleiotropy and mutation type on evolutionary repeatability in a meta-analysis of experimental evolution studies with Escherichia coli. We hypothesize that single-nucleotide polymorphisms are principally able to yield large fitness benefits by targeting highly pleiotropic genes, whereas indels and structural variants provide smaller benefits and are restricted to genes with lower pleiotropy. By using gene connectivity as proxy for pleiotropy, we show that nondisruptive single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in highly pleiotropic genes yield the largest fitness benefits, since they contribute more to parallel evolution, especially in large populations, than inactivating SNPs, indels and structural variants. Our findings underscore the importance of considering genetic architecture together with mutation type for understanding evolutionary repeatability.",

    "abstract": "The \"paradox of the great speciators\" has puzzled evolutionary biologists for over half a century. A great speciator requires excellent dispersal ability to explain its occurrence on multiple islands, but reduced dispersal ability to explain its high number of subspecies. A rapid reduction in dispersal ability is often invoked to solve this apparent paradox, but a proximate mechanism has not been identified. Here, we explore the role of six genes linked to migration and animal personality differences (CREB1, CLOCK, ADCYAP1, NPAS2, DRD4, and SERT) in 20 South Pacific populations of silvereye (Zosterops lateralis) that range from highly sedentary to partially migratory, to determine if genetic variation is associated with dispersal propensity. We detected genetic associations in three of the six genes: i) in a partial migrant population, migrant individuals had longer microsatellite alleles at the CLOCK gene compared to resident individuals from the same population; ii) CREB1 displayed longer average microsatellite allele lengths in recently colonised island populations (< 200 years), compared to evolutionarily older populations. Bayesian broken stick regression models supported a reduction in CREB1 length with time since colonisation and decreasing dispersal propensity; and iii) like CREB1, DRD4 showed differences in polymorphisms between recent and old colonisations but a further sample size is needed to confirm. ADCYAP1, SERT, and NPAS2 were variable but that variation was not associated with dispersal propensity. The association of genetic variants at three genes with migration and dispersal ability in silvereyes provides the impetus for further exploration of genetic mechanisms underlying dispersal shifts, and the prospect of resolving a long-running evolutionary paradox through a genetic lens.",

    "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a severe traumatic neurological condition often caused by car accidents, violent impacts, or unintentional falls and can have devastating consequences for the patient. SCI include primary and secondary injuries. Followed by primary injury, and secondary injuries including inflammatory responses and oxidative stress, which exacerbate the disease process of SCI. Therefore, the treatment of SCI, especially the suppression of secondary injuries, is a major focus of attention in the field of neuroscience. In previous studies, we have demonstrated that zinc therapy can exert neuroprotective effects in mice after acute SCI, including reducing the inflammatory response in the central nervous system, decreasing the neuronal apoptosis and downregulating oxidative stress at the region of injury. However, little is known about how zinc therapy systematically alleviates SCI. Here, we have systematically analysed and mapped the single-cell atlas of the spinal cord in mice with SCI treated by zinc therapy, which provides a systematic analysis of the transcriptome of individual cells in the spinal cord. Among the results, we found that zinc therapy-induced alterations in the IL-17 inflammatory pathway and produced immune heterogeneity in microglia which are the inherent immune cells in the central nervous system. By cell subpopulations clustering analysis, we defined seven microglia subpopulations in zinc-therapy spinal cord tissue and identified the presence of novel VEGFA+ microglia. This finding presents that the microglia subpopulations affected by zinc therapy may have the potential to promote angiogenesis, which is a potential mechanism for the treatment of SCI. In conclusion, this study maps/reveals the transcriptomic of zinc therapy for the treatment of acute SCI with unprecedented resolution and provides a molecular basis for the clinical application.",

    "abstract": "Mutational analysis of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) has revealed various regions of the protein that modulate prion propagation. However, most approaches involve deletions, insertions, or replacements in the presence of the wild-type cellular protein, which may mask the true phenotype. Here, site-directed alanine mutagenesis of PrPC was conducted to identify sites particularly a  surface patch of the protein pertinent to prion propagation in the absence of the wild-type prion protein. Mutations were targeted to the helical, sheet and loop regions of PrPC, or a combination thereof and the mutated proteins expressed in PK1 cells in which endogenous PrPC had been silenced. PK1 cells are a clone of mouse neuroblastoma cells that are highly susceptible to Rocky Mountain Laboratory mouse prions. Using the scrapie cell assay, a highly sensitive cell culture-based bioassay for quantifying infectious titres of mouse prions, we found that all mutations within the structured 121-230 domain, irrespective of secondary structure, severely reduced prion propagation. The reduction was most pronounced for mutations within conformationally variable regions of the protein (G123A.L124A.G125A and V188A.T191A.T192A) and those neighbouring or within helix 1 (S134A.R135A.M153A and H139A.G141A.D146A). While mutations G123A and G125A would likely disrupt the structure of the prion fibril, the other mutations are unlikely to cause disruption. Our data therefore suggests that conformationally variable regions within the structured domain of PrPC are the major determinants of prion propagation efficacy.",

However, such disorders often affect large brain regions. Moreover, the applicability of FUS-BBBO in the treatment of brain-wide genetic disorders has not yet been evaluated. Herein, we evaluated the transduction efficiency and safety of opening up to 105 sites simultaneously. Increasing the number of targeted sites increased gene delivery efficiency at each site. We achieved transduction of up to 60% of brain cells with comparable efficiency in the majority of the brain regions. Furthermore, gene delivery with FUS-BBBO was safe even when all 105 sites were targeted simultaneously without negative effects on animal weight, neuronal loss, or astrocyte activation. To evaluate the application of multi-site FUS-BBBO for gene therapy, we used it for gene editing using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated 9 (Cas9) system, and found effective gene editing, but also a loss of neurons at the targeted sites. Overall, this study provides a brain-wide map of transduction efficiency and the first example of gene editing after site-specific noninvasive gene delivery to a large brain region.",

    "abstract": "Cell-type deconvolution methods aim to infer cell-type composition and the cell abundances from bulk transcriptomic data. The proliferation of currently developed methods (>50), coupled with the inconsistent results obtained in many cases, highlights the pressing need for guidance in the selection of appropriate methods.. Previous proposed tests have primarily been focused on simulated data and have seen limited application to actual datasets.. The growing accessibility of systematic single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, often accompanied by bulk RNA sequencing from related or matched samples, makes it possible to benchmark the existing deconvolution methods more objectively. Here, we propose a comprehensive assessment of 29 available deconvolution methods, leveraging single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from different organs and tissues. We offer a new comprehensive framework to evaluate deconvolution across a wide range of scenarios and we provide guidelines on the preprocessing of input matrices. We then validate deconvolution results on a gold standard bulk Polymorphonuclear Peripheral/Blood Mononuclear cell (PMN/PBMC) dataset with well known cell-type proportions. We show that single-cell regression-based deconvolution methods perform well but their performance is highly dependent on the reference selection and the tissue type. Our study also explores the significant impact of various batch effects on deconvolution, including those associated with sample, study, and technology, which have been previously overlooked. Importantly, we suggest a novel methodology for consensus prediction of cell-type proportions for cases when ground truth is not available. The large-scale assessment of cell-type prediction methods is provided in a modularised pipeline for reproducibility (https://github.com/Functional-Genomics/CATD_snakemake). Lastly, we suggest/propose/recommend that the Critical Assessment of Transcriptomic Deconvolution (CATD) pipeline be employed for the efficient, simultaneous deconvolution of hundreds of real bulk samples, utilising various references. weenvision it to be used for speeding up the evaluation of newly published methods in the future.",

Samples covered three tissue types (Stalk, Root, and Rhizosphere) in two field experiments and one greenhouse experiment. Bacterial diversity was affected by location and tissue type, but not genetic background, for both within-sample (alpha) and between-sample (beta) diversity. PERMANOVA analysis similarly showed that tissue type and location had significant effects on the overall community structure, whereas the genetic background and individual plant genotypes did not. Differential abundance analysis identified only 18 bacterial ASVs that significantly differed between inbred and hybrid maize. Predicted metagenome content was inferred with Picrust2, and it also showed a significantly larger effect of tissue and location than genetic background. Overall, these results indicate that the bacterial communities of inbred and hybrid maize are often more similar than they are different, and that non-genetic effects are generally the largest influences on the maize microbiome.",

Multiple genes have been described to be responsible for monogenic diabetes, but the information on the variants is not unified among different resources. In this work, we aimed to develop an automated pipeline that collects all the genetic variants associated with monogenic diabetes from different resources, unify the data and translate the genetic sequences to the proteins.\n\nMethodsThe pipeline developed in this work is written in Python with the use of Jupyter notebook. It consists of 6 modules that can be implemented separately. The translation step is performed using the ProVar tool also written in Python. All the code along with the intermediate and final results is available for public access and reuse.\n\nResultsThe resulting database had 2701 genomic variants in total and was divided into two levels: the variants reported to have an association with monogenic diabetes and the variants that have evidence of pathogenicity. Of them, 2565 variants were found in the ClinVar database and the rest 136 were found in the literature showing that the overlap between resources is not absolute.\n\nConclusionsWe have developed an automated pipeline for collecting and harmonizing data on genetic variants associated with monogenic diabetes. Furthermore, we have translated variant genetic sequences into protein sequences accounting for all protein isoforms and their variants. This allows researchers to consolidate information on variant genes and proteins associated with monogenic diabetes and facilitates their study using proteomics or structural biology. Our open and flexible implementation using Jupyter notebooks enables tailoring and modifying the pipeline and its application to other rare diseases.\n\nResearch in contextO_LIMonogenic diabetes is a group of Mendelian diseases with an autosomal-dominant pattern of inheritance.\nC_LIO_LIMonogenic diabetes is mainly caused by rare genetic variants that are usually evaluated manually.\nC_LIO_LIThe data on the variants are stored in several resources and are not unified in terms of the genomic coordinates, alleles, and variant annotation.\nC_LIO_LIWhat can be done for the systematic evaluation of the variants and their protein consequences?\nC_LIO_LIIn this work, we have created an automated Jupyter notebook-based pipeline for the collection and unification of the variants associated with monogenic diabetes.\nC_LIO_LIThe database of the genetic variants was created and translated to all possible variant protein sequences.\nC_LIO_LIThese results will be used for the analysis of proteomics data and protein structure modeling.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Space and time can each act as scaffolds for the individuation and selection of visual objects in working memory. Here we ask whether there is a trade-off between the use of space and time for visual working memory: whether observers will rely less on space, when memoranda can additionally be individuated through time. We tracked the use of space through directional biases in microsaccades after attention was directed to memory contents that had been encoded simultaneously or sequentially to the left and right of fixation. We found that spatial gaze biases were preserved when participants could (Experiment 1) and even when they had to (Experiment 2) additionally rely on time for object individuation. Thus, space remains a profound organizing medium for working memory even when other organizing sources are available and utilised, with no evidence for a trade-off between the use of space and time.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSpace and time provide two foundational dimensions that govern not only our sensations and actions, but also the organisation of internal representations in working memory. Space and time have each been shown to provide an automatic organising principle - or scaffold - for memory retention. We uniquely address whether there is a trade-off between the use of space and time for working memory. We show that the profound and automatic reliance on memorised space is preserved not only when time can, but even when time has to be used for individuation and selection of memory contents. This shows there is no trade-off between spatial and temporal codes available for memory organisation, advancing our understanding of the spatial-temporal architecture of mind.",

    "abstract": "Brain energy stress leads to neuronal hyperexcitability followed by a rapid loss of function and cell death. In contrast, the frog brain switches into a state of extreme metabolic resilience that allows them to maintain motor function during hypoxia as they emerge from hibernation. NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are Ca2+-permeable glutamate receptors that typically drive the loss of homeostasis during hypoxia. Therefore, we hypothesized that hibernation leads to plasticity that reduces the role of NMDARs within neural networks to improve function during energy stress. To test this, we assessed a circuit with a large involvement of NMDAR synapses, the brainstem respiratory network of female bullfrogs, Lithobates catesbieanus. Contrary to our expectations, hibernation did not alter the role of NMDARs in generating network output, nor did it affect the amplitude, kinetics, and hypoxia sensitivity of NMDAR currents. Instead, hibernation strongly reduced NMDAR Ca2+ permeability and enhanced desensitization during repetitive stimulation, with shifts in mRNA copy number for NMDAR subunits that modify receptor function. Under severe hypoxia, the normal NMDAR profile caused network hyperexcitability within minutes, which was mitigated by blocking NMDARs. After hibernation, the modified complement of NMDARs protected against hyperexcitability, as disordered output did not occur for at least one hour in hypoxia. These findings uncover state-dependence in the plasticity of NMDARs, whereby distinct changes to receptor function improve neural performance during energy stress without interfering with its normal role during healthy activity.\n\nSignificance StatementNeural circuits in the vertebrate brain lose homeostasis during severe energy stress. Ca2+-permeable NMDA-glutamate receptors play a major role in this response. In contrast, frogs have the remarkable capacity to improve circuit function from minutes to hours during hypoxia, likely as an adaptation to survive emergence from hibernation. We found that this network gains the ability to function during hypoxia through modification of NMDA receptors, rendering them less permeable to Ca2+ and more likely to desensitize during high levels of activity. NMDA receptor modifications do not influence normal network function but prevent hyperexcitability during hypoxia typically caused by Ca2+-permeable NMDA receptors. This work identifies plasticity mechanisms that improve network function during energy stress without altering circuit function when the brain is well-oxygenated.",

    "abstract": "Impulsive choice, often characterized by excessive preference for small, short-term rewards over larger, long-term rewards, is a prominent feature of substance use and other neuropsychiatric disorders. The neural mechanisms underlying impulsive choice are not well understood, but growing evidence implicates nucleus accumbens (NAc) dopamine and its actions on dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs). Because several NAc cell types and afferents express D2Rs, it has been difficult to determine the specific neural mechanisms linking NAc D2Rs to impulsive choice. Of these cell types, cholinergic interneurons (CINs) of the NAc, which express D2Rs, have emerged as key regulators of striatal output and local dopamine release. Despite these relevant functions, whether D2Rs expressed specifically in these neurons contribute to impulsive choice behavior is unknown. Here, we show that D2R upregulation in CINs of the mouse NAc increases impulsive choice as measured in a delay discounting task without affecting reward magnitude sensitivity or interval timing. Conversely, mice lacking D2Rs in CINs showed decreased delay discounting. Furthermore, CIN D2R manipulations did not affect probabilistic discounting, which measures a different form of impulsive choice. Together, these findings suggest that CIN D2Rs regulate impulsive decision-making involving delay costs, providing new insight into the mechanisms by which NAc dopamine influences impulsive behavior.",

    "abstract": "Infra-slow fluctuations (ISFs, 0.008-0.1 Hz) characterize hemodynamic and electric potential signals from the human brain. ISFs are known to correlate with the amplitude dynamics of fast (> 1 Hz) neuronal oscillations, and may arise from permeability fluctuations of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Slow physiological pulsations such as respiration may also influence the amplitude dynamics of fast oscillations, but it remains uncertain if these processes track the fluctuations of fast cortical oscillations or act as their drivers. Moreover, possible effects of sleep and associated BBB permeability changes on such coupling are unknown. Here, we used non-invasive high-density full-band electroencephalography (EEG) in healthy human volunteers (N=21) to measure concurrently the ISFs, respiratory pulsations, and fast neuronal oscillations during periods of wakefulness and sleep, and to assess the strength and direction of their phase-amplitude coupling. The phases of ISFs and respiration were both coupled with the amplitude of fast neuronal oscillations, with stronger ISF coupling evident during sleep. Causality analysis robustly showed that the phase of ISF and respiration drove the amplitude dynamics of fast oscillations in sleeping and waking states. However, the net direction of modulation was stronger during the awake state, despite the stronger power and phase-amplitude coupling of slow signals during sleep. These findings show that the ISFs in slow cortical potentials and respiration together significantly determine the dynamics of fast cortical oscillations. We propose that these slow physiological phases are involved in coordinating cortical excitability, which is a fundamental aspect of brain function.\n\nSignificance StatementPreviously disregarded EEG infra-slow fluctuations (0.008-0.1 Hz) and slow physiological pulsations such as respiration have been attracting increasing research interest, which shows that both of these signals correlate with fast (> 1 Hz) neuronal oscillations. However, little has been known about the mechanisms underlying these interactions; for example, the direction of causality in this interaction has not hitherto been studied. Therefore, we investigated full-band EEG in healthy volunteers during wakefulness and sleep to determine if ISF and respiration phases drive neuronal amplitudes. Results showed that ISF and respiration are phase-amplitude coupled, and predict neuronal EEG rhythms. Thus, we conclude that fast neuronal rhythms in human brain are modulated by slower non-neural phenomena.",

    "abstract": "The activity of neurons is influenced by random fluctuations and can be strongly modulated by firing rate adaptation, especially in sensory systems. Still, there is an ongoing debate about the characteristics of neuronal noise and the mechanisms of adaptation, and even less is known about how exactly they affect perception. Noise and adaptation play central roles in binocular rivalry, a visual phenomenon where two images compete for perceptual dominance. Here, we investigated the effects of different noise processes and adaptation mechanisms on visual perception by simulating a model of binocular rivalry with Gaussian white noise, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise, and pink noise, in variants with divisive adaptation, subtractive adaptation, and without adaptation. By simulating the nine versions of the model for a wide range of parameter values, we find that white noise only produces rivalry when paired with subtractive adaptation and that subtractive adaptation reduces the influence of noise intensity on rivalry strength and introduces convergence of the mean percept duration, an important metric of binocular rivalry, across all noise processes. In sum, our results show that white noise is an insufficient description of background activity in the brain and that subtractive adaptation is a stronger and more general switching mechanism in binocular rivalry than divisive adaptation, with important noise-filtering properties.\n\nAuthor SummaryVisual neurons adapt to the environment by reducing the number of spikes evoked by a constant stimulus. They are also susceptible to random spikes produced by nearby neurons. These two phenomena, adaptation and noise, are essential features of brain activity and affect how we perceive the world. Although we know a great deal about the visual system, our understanding of the properties and mechanisms of neuronal noise and adaptation is still piecemeal, and even less is known about how these microscopic processes affect macroscopic behaviors. We shed light on this question by studying a bistable visual phenomenon called binocular rivalry, where two images compete for perception and where noise and adaptation play important roles. We simulated the activity of neurons involved in binocular rivalry to test different hypotheses about the statistics of neuronal noise and the mechanisms of adaptation. Our results reveal important differences between subtractive and divisive adaptation, suggesting that subtractive adaptation is a stronger switching mechanism in binocular rivalry and an effective noise filter. Our simulations also show the fundamental distinction between noise with and without temporal correlation, supporting the correlated noise hypothesis.",

The mechanisms and neurochemical substrates underlying TUS neuromodulation in humans and how these relate to excitation and inhibition are still poorly understood. In 24 healthy controls, we separately stimulated two deep cortical regions and investigated the effects of theta-burst TUS, a protocol shown to increase corticospinal excitability, on the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and functional connectivity. We show for the first time in humans that theta-burst TUS selectively reduces GABA levels in the posterior cingulate, but not the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Functional connectivity increased following TUS in both regions. Our findings suggest that TUS changes overall excitability by reducing GABAergic inhibition, that changes in TUS-mediated neuroplasticity last at least 50 minutes after stimulation, and that these effects may be state-dependent - a mechanism increasingly recognized to influence the brains response to neuromodulation.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons Disease causes progressive and debilitating changes to the brain as well as to the mind. While the diagnostic hallmark features are the characteristic movement-related symptoms, the disease also causes decline in sensory processing, cognitive, emotional performance and most patients develop dementia over time. The extent of symptoms and the brain-wide projections of neuromodulators such as dopamine suggest that many brain regions are simultaneously affected in Parkinsons disease. To characterise such disease-related and brain-wide changes in neuronal function, we performed a source level analysis of resting state magnetoencephalogram (MEG) from two groups: Parkinsons disease patients and healthy controls. Besides standard spectral analysis, we quantified the aperiodic component of the neural activity by fitting a power law ({kappa}/f {lambda}) to the MEG spectrum and then studied its relationship with age and UPDRS. Consistent with previous results, the most significant spectral changes were observed in the high theta/low alpha band (7-10 Hz) in all brain regions. Furthermore, analysis of the aperiodic part of the spectrum showed that, in all but frontal regions, {lambda} was significantly larger in Parkinsons disease patients than in control subjects. Our results indicate for the first time that Parkinsons disease is associated with significant changes in population activity across the whole neocortex. Surprisingly, even early sensory areas showed a significantly larger {lambda} in patients than in healthy controls. Moreover, {lambda} was not affected by the L-dopa medication. Finally, {lambda} was positively correlated with patient age but not with UPDRS-III (summary measure of motor symptoms clinical rating). Because {lambda} is closely associated excitationinhibition balance, our results propose new hypotheses about manifestation of Parkinsons disease in cortical networks.",

Here we show that cortical neurons derived from patients with TCF4 mutations have deficits in spontaneous synaptic transmission, network excitability and homeostatic plasticity. Transcriptomic analysis indicates these phenotypes result from altered expression of genes involved in presynaptic neurotransmission and identifies the presynaptic binding protein, RIMBP2 as the most differentially expressed gene in PTHS neurons. Remarkably, TCF4-dependent deficits in spontaneous synaptic transmission and network excitability were rescued by increasing RIMBP2 expression in presynaptic neurons. Together, these results identify TCF4 as a critical transcriptional regulator of human synaptic development and plasticity and specifically identifies dysregulation of presynaptic function as an early pathophysiology in PTHS.",

Additionally, the model accurately predicts how these measures respond to sleep deprivation or abundance. Furthermore, the model passes the ultimate test, as its prediction leads to a novel experimental finding--an invariant relationship between the duration of NonREM episodes and the intensity of REM episodes, the product of which remains constant over consecutive sleep cycles.

    "abstract": "Neurons produce and release neuropeptides to communicate with one another. Despite their profound impact on critical brain functions, circuit-based mechanisms of peptidergic transmission are poorly understood, primarily due to the lack of tools for monitoring and manipulating neuropeptide release in vivo. Here, we report the development of two genetically encoded tools for investigating peptidergic transmission in behaving mice: a genetically encoded large dense core vesicle (LDCV) sensor that detects the neuropeptides release presynaptically, and a genetically encoded silencer that specifically degrades neuropeptides inside the LDCV. Monitoring and silencing peptidergic and glutamatergic transmissions from presynaptic terminals using our newly developed tools and existing genetic tools, respectively, reveal that neuropeptides, not glutamate, are the primary transmitter in encoding unconditioned stimulus during Pavlovian threat learning. These results show that our sensor and silencer for peptidergic transmission are reliable tools to investigate neuropeptidergic systems in awake behaving animals.",

    "abstract": "Although classically Rapid-Eye Movement (REM) sleep is thought to generate desynchronized activity similar to wakefulness, it was found that some brain regions can express Slow Wave activity (SWA), a pattern which is normally typical of slow-wave sleep. To investigate possible underlying mechanisms, we analyze experimental recordings and introduce a computational model of mice cerebral cortex in REM sleep. We characterized the patterns of slow-wave activity across somatosensory and motor areas, and find that the most prominent REM-related SWA is present in the primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory areas, more rarely seen in motor cortex, and absent from prefrontal cortex or hippocampus. The SWA also tends to be synchronized in S1 and S2. We next investigated possible mechanisms by using a computational model of the mouse brain consisting of adaptive Exponential (AdEx) mean-fields connected together according to the mouse connectome. To compare with experimental data, the local field potential is calculated in each mouse brain region. To reproduce the experiments, we had to assume a heterogeneous level of adaptation in different cortical regions during REM sleep. In these conditions, the model reproduces some of the experimental observations in the somato-motor areas and the other cortical areas. We then used the model to test how the presence of SWA affects cortical responsiveness. Indeed, we find that the areas expressing SWA have diminished evoked responses, which may participate to a diminished responsiveness during REM sleep.",

    "abstract": "Personalized neurostimulation has been a potential treatment for many brain diseases, which requires insights into brain/skull geometry. Here, we developed an open source efficient pipeline BrainCalculator for automatically computing the skull thickness map, scalp-to-cortex distance (SCD), and brain volume based on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. We examined the influence of age and sex cross-sectionally in 407 cognitively normal older adults (71.9{+/-}8.0 years, 60.2% female) from the ADNI. We demonstrated the compatibility of our pipeline with commonly used preprocessing packages and found that BrainSuite Skullfinder was better suited for such automatic analysis compared to FSL Brain Extraction Tool 2 and SPM12- based unified segmentation using ground truth. We found that the sphenoid bone and temporal bone were thinnest among the skull regions in both females and males. There was no increase in regional minimum skull thickness with age except in the female sphenoid bone. No sex difference in minimum skull thickness or SCD was observed. Positive correlations between age and SCD were observed, faster in females (0.307%/y) than males (0.216%/y) in temporal SCD. A negative correlation was observed between age and whole brain volume computed based on brain surface (females -1.031%/y, males -0.998%/y). In conclusion, we developed an automatic pipeline for MR-based skull thickness map, SCD, and brain volume analysis and demonstrated the sex-dependent association between minimum regional skull thickness, SCD and brain volume with age. This pipeline might be useful for personalized neurostimulation planning.",

Using fMRI, we show that the human parietal cortex evokes complementary egocentric-like vector representations in conceptual spaces during goal-directed mental search, akin to those observable during physical navigation to determine where a goal is located relative to oneself. Concurrently, grid-like representations, a neural signature of allocentric cognitive maps in entorhinal, prefrontal, and parietal cortices, are restructured as a function of conceptual goal proximity, akin to rodent grid cells firing around reward locations during spatial exploration. These brain mechanisms might support flexible and parallel readout of where target conceptual information is stored in memory, capitalizing on complementary reference frames.",

    "abstract": "It is well established that ones confidence in a choice can be influenced by new evidence encountered after commitment has been reached, but the processes through which post-choice evidence is sampled remain unclear. To investigate this, we traced the pre- and post-choice dynamics of electrophysiological signatures of evidence accumulation (Centro-parietal Positivity, CPP) and motor preparation (mu/beta band) to determine their sensitivity to participants confidence in their perceptual discriminations. Pre-choice CPP amplitudes scaled with confidence both when confidence was reported simultaneously with choice, or when reported 1-second after the initial direction decision. When additional evidence was presented during the post-choice delay period, the CPP continued to evolve after the initial choice, with a more prolonged build-up on trials with lower confidence in the alternative that was finally endorsed, irrespective of whether this entailed a change-of-mind. Further investigation established that this pattern was accompanied by earlier post-choice CPP peak latency, earlier lateralisation of motor preparation signals toward the ultimately chosen response, and faster confidence reports when participants indicated high certainty that they had made a correct or incorrect initial choice. These observations are consistent with confidence-dependent stopping theories according to which post-choice evidence accumulation ceases when a criterion level of confidence in a choice alternative has been reached. Our findings have implications for current models of choice confidence, and predictions they may make about EEG signatures.",

    "abstract": "Our ability to produce successful goal-directed actions involves multiple learning processes. Among these, implicit adaptation is of utmost importance, keeping our sensorimotor system well-calibrated in response to changes in the body and environment. Implicit adaptation is assumed to be driven by a sensory prediction error, the difference between the predicted and actual sensory consequences of a movement. Whereas most models of implicit adaptation have focused on how visual information defines the sensory prediction error, we have recently proposed that this error signal is kinesthetic, the difference between the desired and perceived hand position, with adaptation serving to align these two signals and restore optimal motor performance (Tsay et al., 2022). Here, we examined implicit adaptation and kinesthetic perception in rare individuals who lack proprioceptive signals from the upper limbs. We used a visuomotor rotation task designed to isolate implicit adaptation while simultaneously probing the participants perceived hand position. Consistent with prior work, control participants exhibited robust implicit adaptation and the signature of kinesthetic re-alignment, an initial bias in perceived hand position towards the visual cursor and a gradual shift back to the movement goal. Strikingly, the time course of both implicit adaptation and kinesthetic re-alignment was preserved in the deafferented group, suggesting that proprioceptive afferents are not necessary for implicit adaptation and kinesthetic re-alignment. We propose that a kinesthetic prediction error derived from efferent motor signals is sufficient to drive implicit adaptation and to re-algin a biased percept of hand position with the movement goal.",

    "abstract": "Monitoring the activity of mice within their home cage is proving to be a powerful tool for revealing subtle and early-onset phenotypes in mouse models. Video tracking, in particular, lends itself to automated machine-learning technologies that have the potential to improve the manual annotations carried out by humans. This type of recording and analysis is particularly powerful in objective phenotyping, monitoring behaviors with no experimenter intervention. In this study, we focus on non-evoked voluntary behaviors, which do not require any contact with the animal or exposure to specialist equipment. We show that the monitoring of climbing on the wire cage lid of a standard individually ventilated cage (IVC) yields reproducible data reflecting complex phenotypes of individual mouse inbred strains and of a widely used mouse model of neurodegeneration. In addition, performing such measurements in the home-cage environment, over several 24-hour periods, allows for the collection of comprehensive behavioral and activity data, which reveals prolific sexual dimorphism and biphasic changes in locomotor activity. Here we present data from home-cage analysis, which reveals the complexity of unprovoked behavior in both wild-type and mutant mice. This has the potential to greatly enhance the characterization of mouse strains, detect early and subtle signs of disease and increase reproducibility in preclinical studies.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that requires iron for growth and virulence, yet this nutrient is sequestered by the innate immune system during infection. When iron is limiting, P. aeruginosa expresses the PrrF1 and PrrF2 small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs), which post-transcriptionally repress expression of non-essential iron-containing proteins thus sparing this nutrient for more critical processes. The genes for the PrrF1 and PrrF2 sRNAs are arranged in tandem on the chromosome, allowing for the transcription of a longer heme-responsive sRNA, termed PrrH. While the functions of PrrF1 and PrrF2 have been studied extensively, the role of PrrH in P. aeruginosa physiology and virulence is not well understood. In this study, we performed transcriptomic and proteomic studies to identify the PrrH regulon. In shaking cultures, the pyochelin synthesis proteins were increased in two distinct prrH mutants compared to wild type, while the mRNAs for these proteins were not affected by prrH mutation. We identified complementarity between the PrrH sRNA and sequence upstream of the pchE mRNA, suggesting potential for PrrH to directly regulate expression of genes for pyochelin synthesis. We further showed that pchE mRNA levels were increased in the prrH mutants when grown in static but not shaking conditions. Moreover, we discovered controlling for the presence of light was critical for examining the impact of PrrH on pchE expression. As such, our study reports on the first likely target of the PrrH sRNA and highlights key environmental variables that will allow for future characterization of PrrH function.\n\nImportanceIn the human host, iron is predominantly in the form of heme, which Pseudomonas aeruginosa can acquire as an iron source during infection. We previously showed that the iron-responsive PrrF sRNAs are critical for mediating iron homeostasis during P. aeruginosa infection; however the function of the heme-responsive PrrH sRNA remains unclear. In this study, we identified genes for pyochelin siderophore biosynthesis, which mediate uptake of inorganic iron, as a novel target of PrrH regulation. This study therefore highlights a novel relationship between heme availability and siderophore biosynthesis in P. aeruginosa.",

    "abstract": "Metabolite exchange within marine microbial communities transfers carbon and other major elements through global cycles and forms the basis of microbial interactions. Yet lack of gene annotations and concern about the quality of existing ones remain major impediments to revealing the metabolite-microbial network. We employed an arrayed mutant library of the marine bacterium Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3 to experimentally annotate substrates of organic compound transporter systems, using mutant growth and compound drawdown analyses to link transporters to their substrates. Mutant experiments verified substrates for thirteen R. pomeroyi transporters. Four were previously hypothesized based on gene expression data (taurine, glucose/xylose, isethionate, and cadaverine/putrescine/spermidine); five were previously hypothesized based on homology to experimentally annotated transporters in other bacteria (citrate, glycerol, N-acetylglucosamine, fumarate/malate/succinate, and dimethylsulfoniopropionate); and four had no previous annotations (thymidine, carnitine, cysteate, and 3-hydroxybutyrate transporter). These bring the total number of experimentally-verified organic carbon influx transporters to 17 of 126 in the R. pomeroyi genome. In a longitudinal study of a coastal phytoplankton bloom, expression patterns of the experimentally annotated transporters linked them to different stages of the bloom, and also led to the hypothesis that citrate and 3-hydroxybutyrate were among the most highly available bacterial substrates. Improved functional knowledge of these gatekeepers of organic carbon uptake is facilitating better characterization of the surface ocean metabolite network.",

    "abstract": "Plant pathogenic Ralstonia strains cause bacterial wilt disease by colonizing xylem vessels of many crops, including tomato. Host resistance is the best control for bacterial wilt, but resistance mechanisms of the widely used Hawaii7996 tomato breeding line are unknown. Using growth in ex vivo xylem sap as a proxy for host xylem, we found that Ralstonia strain GMI1000 grows in sap from both healthy plants and Ralstonia-infected susceptible plants. However, sap from Ralstonia-infected Hawaii7996 plants inhibited Ralstonia growth, suggesting that in response to Ralstonia infection, resistant plants increase inhibitors in their xylem sap. Consistent with this, reciprocal grafting and defense gene expression experiments indicated that Hawaii7996 wilt resistance acts both above- and belowground. Concerningly, Hawaii7996 resistance is broken by Ralstonia strain UW551 of the pandemic lineage that threatens highland tropical agriculture. Unlike other Ralstonia strains, UW551 grew well in sap from Ralstonia-infected Hawaii7996 plants. Moreover, other Ralstonia strains could grow in sap from Hawaii7996 plants previously infected by UW551. Thus, UW551 overcomes Hawaii7996 resistance in part by detoxifying inhibitors in xylem sap. Testing a panel of xylem sap compounds identified by metabolomics revealed that no single chemical differentially inhibits Ralstonia strains that cannot infect Hawaii7996. However, sap from Ralstonia-infected Hawaii7996 contained more phenolic compounds, which are known plant antimicrobial defenses. Culturing UW551 in this sap reduced total phenolic levels, indicating that the resistance-breaking Ralstonia strain degrades these chemical defenses. Together, these results suggest that Hawaii7996 tomato wilt resistance depends at least in part on inducible phenolic compounds in xylem sap.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDemonstration of the transfer, dynamics, and regulation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in a complex environmental matrix is yet experimentally challenging, with many essential open questions such as how and where transfer and dissemination of ARGs happens in nature. The extent and conditions of MGEs transfer that carry ARGs is still largely unexplored in natural environments and microbial communities. Biofilms are structures that include high density multi-species bacterial communities embedded in self-produced extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) constituting a matrix that facilitates gene transfer and where bacteria exhibit high tolerance to stress and to antibiotics. In this study we implemented a sampling and analysis approach that allows phenotypic and genomic analyses of in situ and reconstituted in vitro hospital and urban wastewater (WW) biofilms. To assess the potential of hospital and urban WW biofilms to efficiently disseminate ARGs in the WW system, we explored the EPS within the biofilm matrix and assessed the expression of the resistome (ARGs) and mobilome (MGEs) by metatranscriptomics.\n\nResultsWe first showed that a) the composition of EPS differs depending on their growth environment (in situ and in vitro) and their sampling origin (hospital vs urban WW) and that b) a low amount of ciprofloxacin impacted the composition of the EPS. Next, the metatranscriptomic approach showed that a) expression of ARGs and MGEs increase upon adding a low amount of ciprofloxacin for biofilms from hospital WW but not for those from urban WW and b) that expression of specific plasmids that carry individual or multiple ARGs varies depending on the WW origins of the biofilms. When the same plasmids were expressed in both, urban and hospital WW biofilms, they carried and expressed different ARGs.\n\nConclusionWe show that hospital and urban wastewaters shape the structure and active resistome of environmental biofilms, and we confirmed that hospital WW is an important hot spot for the dissemination and selection of AMR. The different responses to antibiotic pressure in hospital vs urban biofilms, coupled with differences in biofilm structure helps delineate distinct characteristics of hospital and urban WW biofilms highlighting the relationships between the resistome and its expression in environmental biofilms and their surrounding ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Immunosenescence refers to the development of weakened and/or dysfunctional immune responses associated with aging. Several commensal bacteria can be pathogenic in immunosuppressed individuals. Although Klebsiella pneumoniae is a commensal bacterium that colonizes human mucosal surfaces, the gastrointestinal tract, and the oropharynx, it can cause serious infectious diseases, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and liver abscesses, primarily in elderly patients. However, the reason why K. pneumoniae targets elderly population remains unclear. This study aimed to determine how the intestinal immune response of the host to K. pneumoniae varies with age. To this end, the study analyzed an in vivo K. pneumoniae infection model using aged mice, as well as an in vitro K. pneumoniae infection model using a Transwell insert co-culture system comprised of epithelial cells and macrophages. In this study, we demonstrate that growth arrest-specific 6 (Gas6), released by intestinal macrophages that recognize K. pneumoniae, inhibits bacterial translocation from the gastrointestinal tract by enhancing tight-junction barriers in the intestinal epithelium. However, in aging mice, Gas6 was hardly secreted under K. pneumoniae infection due to decreasing intestinal mucosal macrophages; therefore, K. pneumoniae can easily invade the intestinal epithelium and subsequently translocate to the liver. Moreover, the administration of Gas6 recombinant protein to elderly mice prevented the translocation of orally infected K. pneumoniae from the gastrointestinal tract and significantly prolonged their survival. From these findings, we conclude that the age-related decrease in Gas6 secretion in the intestinal mucosa is the reason why K. pneumoniae can be pathogenic in the elderly, thereby indicating that Gas6 could be effective in protecting the elderly against infectious diseases caused by gut pathogens.\n\nAuthor SummaryAging causes a weakened/dysfunctional human immune system, reducing the ability to combat pathogens. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying age-related immunosenescence is critical for the development of preventive therapies against bacterial infectious diseases in elderly individuals. Klebsiella pneumoniae is a representative \"pathobiont\" that causes serious systemic infections such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and liver abscesses, mainly in the elderly. However, it remains unclear how K. pneumoniae targets the elderly population. Here, we show that growth arrest-specific 6 (Gas6), released by intestinal macrophages that recognize K. pneumoniae, inhibits bacterial invasion into the intestinal epithelium and subsequent translocation to the liver. However, in elderly mice, Gas6 is hardly secreted due to decreased intestinal mucosal macrophages; therefore, K. pneumoniae can easily translocate to the liver from the gastrointestinal tract. We concluded that the reason K. pneumoniae can be pathogenic to the elderly is the age-related decrease in Gas6 secretion in the intestinal mucosa. Moreover, we revealed that the administration of Gas6 to elderly mice significantly prevented systemic translocation of orally infected K. pneumoniae. Our findings provide new insights into the prevention of infectious diseases in the elderly.",

    "abstract": "Sobemoviruses encode serine-like 3C proteases (Pro) that participate in the processing and maturation of other virus-encoded proteins. Its cis and trans activity is mediated by the naturally unfolded virus-genome-linked protein (VPg). NMR studies show a Pro-VPg complex interaction and VPg tertiary structure; however, information regarding structural changes of the Pro-VPg complex during interaction is lacking. Here, we solved a full Pro-VPg 3D structure of ryegrass mottle virus (RGMoV) that demonstrates the structural changes in three different conformations due to VPg interaction with Pro. We identified a unique site of VPg interaction with Pro that was not observed in other sobemoviruses and observed different conformations of the Pro {beta}2 barrel. This is the first report of a full plant Pro crystal structure with its VPg cofactor. We also confirmed the existence of an unusual previously unmapped cleavage site for sobemovirus Pro in the transmembrane domain: E/A. We demonstrated that RGMoV Pro in cis activity is not regulated by VPg and that in trans, VPg can also mediate Pro in free form. Additionally, we observed Ca2+ and Zn2+ inhibitory activities on the Pro cleavage activity.\n\nAuthor summaryThe gRNA of sobemoviruses encodes two polyproteins that are processed by a serine protease. We found that in the bacterial expression system, Pro is active in cis and in trans, where only in trans activity is mediated by VPg not only in the fusion form with Pro but also in the free form. Here, we present structural changes in the catalytic and substrate-binding sites of Pro caused by VPg, which can explain the in trans activity and structure of sobemovirus VPg C-terminal peptide. In addition, we confirmed a new cleavage site not previously characterized in sobemoviruses. Additionally, Ca2+ and Zn2+ decreased Pro cleavage activity. This information could provide a better understanding of a serine protease and their proteolytic mechanisms during viral protein maturation.",

    "abstract": "Spore-forming bacteria are prevalent in mammalian guts and have implications for host health and nutrition. The production of dormant spores is thought to play an important role in the colonization, persistence, and transmission of these bacteria. Spore formation also modifies interactions among microorganisms such as infection by phages. Recent studies suggest that phages may counter dormancy-mediated defense through the expression of phage-encoded sporulation genes during infection, which can alter the transitions between active and inactive states. By mining genomes and gut-derived metagenomes, we identified sporulation genes that are preferentially encoded by phages that infect spore-forming bacteria. These included genes involved in chromosome partitioning, DNA damage repair, and cell wall-associated functions. In addition, phages contained homologs of sporulation-specific transcription factors, notably spo0A, the master regulator of sporulation, which could allow phages to control the complex genetic network responsible for spore development. Our findings suggest that phages could influence the formation of bacterial spores with implications for the health of the human gut microbiome, as well as bacterial communities in other environments.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEPhages acquire bacterial genes and use them to alter host metabolism in ways that enhance their fitness. To date, most auxiliary genes replace or modulate enzymes that are used by the host for nutrition or energy production. However, phage fitness is affected by all aspects of host physiology, including decisions that reduce metabolic activity of the cell. Here we focus on endosporulation, a complex and ancient form of dormancy found among the Bacillota that involves hundreds of genes. By coupling homology searches with host classification, we identify 31 phage-encoded homologs of sporulation genes that are mostly limited to phages infecting spore-forming bacteria. Nearly one-third the homologs recovered were regulatory genes suggesting that phages may manipulate host genetic networks by tapping into their control elements. Our findings also suggest a mechanism by which phages can overcome the defensive strategy of dormancy, which may be involved in coevolutionary dynamics of spore-forming bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Biofilms represent a prevalent lifestyle of unicellular organism that confers protection to external challenges. The mechanisms by which archaea form biofilms are however not entirely clear. H. volcanii is an extremely halophilic euryarchaeon that commonly colonizes salt crust surfaces. H. volcanii produces long and thin appendages called type IV pili that are known to play a function in surface attachment and biofilm formation in archaea and bacteria. Here, we used biophysical experiments to identify critical function of type IV pili in the mechanical integrity of H. volcanii biofilms. Using interferometric scattering microscopy (iSCAT) to non-invasively visualize T4P in live cells, we find that piliation varies across mutants expressing single pilin isoforms. Using microfluidic experiments, we found that the adhesive strength of these mutants correlates with their extent of piliation. We found that in flow, H. volcanii forms clonal biofilms that extend in three dimensions. Expression of PilA2, a single pilin isoform, is sufficient to maintain normal levels of piliation and form biofilms with a structure indistinguishable from WT. Furthermore, we found that fluid flow is a crucial determinant of biofilm integrity: in the absence of flow, biofilms lose cohesion and tend to disperse in a density-dependent manner. Overall, our results demonstrate that T4P-surface and possibly T4P-T4P interactions promote biofilm formation and integrity, and that flow is a crucial ingredient regulating archaeal biofilm formation.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionParasites can modify host behavior to ensure their own growth and transmission. Multiple species of the fungi Ophiocordyceps infect ants, but in a species-specific manner; one fungal species co-evolved to successfully modify the behavior of one ant species. However, several characteristics of the behavioral modification seem to be similar across different Ophiocordyceps-ant systems, including a preference for the time of the day for manipulating host behavior. In this study, we explored the various mechanisms via which the circadian clock of Ophiocordyceps might be playing a role in modifying host behavior. We studied O. camponoti-floridani that modifies the behavior of its ant host Camponotus floridanus. To separate the role of the clock in behavior manipulation, from its role in growth and survival, we compared the daily gene expression profile of O. camponoti-floridani to a generalist, non-manipulating fungal parasite, Beauveria bassiana, which also successfully infects the same ant host.\n\nResultsMajority of the 24h rhythmic O. camponoti-floridani genes show peak expression before or at the transitions between light and dark. Rhythmic genes in O. camponoti-floridani, for which B. bassiana lacks an ortholog, were overrepresented for enterotoxin genes. Around half of all genes that show 24h rhythms in either O. camponoti-floridani or B. bassiana showed a consistent difference in their temporal pattern of daily expression. At the halfway mark in O. camponoti-floridani infections, when diseased ants show a loss of 24h rhythms in daily foraging, several fungal clock genes, including Frequency, showed differential expression. Network analyses revealed a single gene cluster, containing White Collar 1 and 2, that showed overrepresentation for genes oscillating every 24h in liquid culture as well as genes differentially expressed while growing inside the ant head.\n\nConclusionThis study identifies several sets of putatively clock-controlled genes and biological processes in O. camponoti-floridani that likely plays a role in modifying the behavior of its ant host. Differential expression of O. camponoti-floridani clock genes or 24h-rhythmic genes during infection is suggestive of either a loss of daily rhythm or a change in the amplitude of rhythmic gene expression. Both possibilities would suggest that a disease-associated change occurs to the functioning of the O. camponoti-floridani clock, and its output, while the fungi grows inside the ant head.",

While some members of this protein family retain an enzymatic activity capable of cleaving RNA molecules complementary to Argonaute-bound small RNAs, the role of the slicing activity in the canonical microRNA pathway is still unclear in animals. To address the importance of slicing Argonautes in animals, we created Caenorhabditis elegans mutant strains carrying catalytically dead endogenous ALG-1 and ALG-2, the only two slicing Argonautes essential for the miRNA pathway in this animal model. We observe that the loss of ALG-1 and ALG-2 slicing activity affects overall animal fitness and causes phenotypes reminiscent of miRNA defects only when grown and maintained at restrictive temperature. Furthermore, the analysis of global miRNA expression show that the catalytic activity of ALG-1 and ALG-2 differentially regulate the level of specific subsets of miRNAs in young adults. We also demonstrate that altering the slicing activity of those miRNA-specific Argonautes does not result in any defect in the production of canonical miRNAs. Together, these data support that the slicing activity of miRNA-specific Argonautes functions to maintain levels of a set of miRNAs for optimal viability and fitness in animals particularly exposed to specific growing conditions.",

    "abstract": "Most population genetic studies concern spatial genetic differentiation, but far fewer aim at analyzing the temporal genetic changes that occur within populations. Vector species, including mosquitoes and biting midges, are often characterized by oscillating adult population densities, which may affect their dispersal, selection, and genetic diversity over time. Here, we used a population of Culicoides sonorensis from a single site in California to investigate short-term (intra-annual) and long-term (inter-annual) temporal variation in genetic diversity over a three year period. This biting midge species is the primary vector of several viruses affecting both wildlife and livestock, thus a better understanding of the population dynamics of this species can help inform epidemiological studies. We found no significant genetic differentiation between months or years, and no correlation between adult populations and the inbreeding coefficient (FIS). However, we show that repeated periods of low adult abundance during cooler winter months resulted in recurring bottleneck events. Interestingly, we also found a high number of private and rare alleles, which suggests both a large, stable population, as well as a constant influx of migrants from nearby populations. Overall, we showed that the high number of migrants maintains a high level of genetic diversity by introducing new alleles, while this increased diversity is counterbalanced by recurrent bottleneck events potentially purging unfit alleles each year. These results highlight the temporal influences on population structure and genetic diversity in C. sonorensis and provide insight into factors effecting genetic variation that may occur in other vector species with fluctuating populations.",

Based on reporter constructs, the prevailing model suggests that pA-tail removal mediated by Ccr4-NOT or PAN2/3 deadenylases is required for mRNA decapping and degradation. Here, we use direct RNA sequencing to track mRNA deadenylation and decay at steady-state and in stress conditions to show a global correlation between deadenylation and decay. Interestingly, codon optimality, previously postulated to dictate mRNA stability, only strongly affects decay of conserved and abundant transcripts, such as coding for ribosomal protein subunits. Degradation of those mRNAs is also accelerated in response to stress. Still, the in-depth analysis revealed that deadenylation is a factor that contributes to degradation but is not indispensable for decapping. We further demonstrate that deadenylation is the fastest for newly made tails depending on polyA-binding protein Pab1. Unexpectedly, decapping initiates on mRNAs of pA-tails of 20-35 adenosines presumably bound by Pab1.",

    "abstract": "Since the Industrial Revolution, the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) due to anthropogenic activities has increased at unprecedented rates. One-third of the atmospheric anthropogenic CO2 emissions are dissolved in the oceans affecting the chemical equilibrium of seawater, which in turn leads to a decrease in pH and carbonate ion (CO32-) concentration, a phenomenon known as ocean acidification (OA). This chemical disequilibrium can be detrimental to marine organisms (e.g., mollusks) that fabricate mineralized structures based on calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Most studies on the effect of reduced pH in seawater have been conducted on the early developmental stages of shell-building invertebrates, neglecting how adult individuals face OA stress. Here, we evaluate histological, secretory, and transcriptional changes in the mantle of adult oysters (Crassostrea gigas) exposure to ambient (8.0 {+/-} 0.2) and reduced (7.6 {+/-} 0.2) pH during 20 days. Most histological observations did not show differences in terms of mantle cell morphology. However, Alcian Blue/PAS staining revealed significant differences in the number of Alcian Blue positive cells in the mantle edge, suggesting a decrease in the secretory activity in this morphogenetic zone. Transcriptomic analysis revealed 172 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between mantle tissues from adult oysters kept in normal and reduced pH conditions. Almost 18% of the DEGs encode secreted proteins that are likely to be contributing to shell fabrication and patterning. 17 of 31 DEGs encoding secreted proteins correspond to oyster-specific genes, highlighting the fact that molluscan shell formation is underpinned by a rapidly evolving secretome. The GO analysis of DEGs encoding secreted proteins showed that they are involved in the cellular response to stimulus, response to stress, protein binding, and ion binding, suggesting these biological processes and molecular functions are altered by OA. This study demonstrates that histology and gene expression profiling can advance our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying adult oyster tolerance to low pH conditions.",

This selected RNA can then be amplified by strand-specific qPCR, thus enabling investigation of the consequences of defined mutations on the relative synthesis of negative-sense intermediate and positive-strand progeny RNAs.

Here we compared the abundance and activity of peptidases and carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) that are predicted to be extracellular identified in metagenomic assemblies from 63 springs in the Central American and the Andean convergent margin (Argentinian backarc of the Central Volcanic Zone), as well as the plume-influenced spreading center in Iceland. All assemblies contain two orders of magnitude more peptidases than CAZymes, suggesting that the microorganisms more often use proteins for their carbon and/or nitrogen acquisition instead of complex sugars. The CAZy families in highest abundance are GH23 and CBM50, and the most abundant peptidase families are M23 and C26, all four of which degrade peptidoglycan found in bacterial cells. This implies that the heterotrophic community relies on autochthonous dead cell biomass, rather than allochthonous plant matter, for organic material. Enzymes involved in the degradation of cyanobacterial- and algal-derived compounds are in lower abundance at every site, with volcanic sites having more enzymes degrading cyanobacterial compounds and non-volcanic sites having more enzymes degrading algal compounds. Activity assays showed that many of these enzyme classes are active in these samples. High temperature sites (> 80{degrees}C) had similar extracellular carbon-degrading enzymes regardless of their province, suggesting a less well-developed population of secondary consumers at these sites, possibly connected with the limited extent of the subsurface biosphere in these high temperature sites. We conclude that in < 80{degrees}C springs, chemolithoautotrophic production supports heterotrophs capable of degrading a wide range of organic compounds that do not vary by geological province, even though the taxonomic and respiratory repertoire of chemolithoautotrophs and heterotrophs differ greatly across these regions.",

    "abstract": "Cystathionine-{beta}-synthase (CBS)-pair domain divalent metal cation transport mediators (CNNMs) are an evolutionarily conserved family of magnesium transporters. They promote efflux of Mg2+ ions on their own or uptake of divalent cations when coupled to the transient receptor potential ion channel subfamily M member 7 (TRPM7). Recently, ADP-ribosylation factor-like GTPase 15 (ARL15) has been identified as CNNM binding partner and an inhibitor of divalent cation influx by TRPM7. Here, we characterize ARL15 as a GTP-binding protein and demonstrate that it binds the CNNM CBS-pair domain with low micromolar affinity. The crystal structure of the complex between ARL15 GTPase domain and CNNM2 CBS-pair domain reveals the molecular determinants of the interaction and allowed the identification of mutations in ARL15 and CNNM2 mutations that abrogate binding. Loss of CNNM binding prevented ARL15 suppression of TRPM7 channel activity in support of previous reports that the proteins function as a ternary complex. Binding experiments with phosphatase of regenerating liver 2 (PRL2 or PTP4A2) revealed that ARL15 and PRLs compete for binding CNNM, suggesting antagonistic regulation of divalent cation transport by the two proteins.",

    "abstract": "The accumulation of iron-dependent lipid peroxides induces ferroptosis, a nonapoptotic form of cell death that integrates metabolic derangements with oxidative stress1. Multiple organelles regulate ferroptosis, but the mitochondria may be the most important organelle as mitochondria both initiate and propagate ferroptosis1. Altered ferroptosis homeostasis is linked to multiple diseases including cancer, sepsis, cardiovascular diseases, and aging. In the cardiovascular realm, ferroptosis underlies mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired cardiac contractility due to both ischemic and non-ischemic insults1. Additionally, ferroptosis induces endothelial cell dysfunction and accelerates atherosclerosis development in mice2. At present, the role of ferroptosis in the pulmonary vasculature is relatively unexplored. However, pulmonary arterial endothelial cell dysfunction, characterized by disrupted mitochondrial function and impaired iron and lipid metabolism4, contributes to pulmonary hypertension (PH) pathobiology. These molecular phenotypes provide a plausible link between pulmonary vascular disease and ferroptosis. Additionally, ferroptosis inhibition, starting before administration of monocrotaline (MCT), blunts PH severity in rats3, but the preventative approach used in this study may limit its translatability. Here, we employed a drug intervention in translational rodent studies, quantitative lung proteomics, and a human genetic association study to evaluate how ferroptosis modulates PH severity.",

    "abstract": "The estimation of functional connectivity (FC) from electro-(EEG) or magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings suffers from low spatial resolution, being one of the reasons for the reduced number of sensors compared to the number of reconstructed sources of activity. This problem can be avoided by estimating FC between larger regions instead of individual sources. However, combining all the sources in each area to produce a single time series per region is far from trivial.\n\nWe have used simultaneous EEG/MEG data from 11 participants and compared the FC estimates from both techniques by using different multivariate approaches. Since the underlying generators are identical for EEG and MEG, the more similar the FC estimation from both techniques is, the more accurate it is likely to be. The results show that using either the average or the root-mean-square of the bivariate source-to-source FC estimates consistently outperforms the use of a representative time series from each area.\n\nWe concluded that the reconstructed activity in each brain region is too complex to be reduced to a single representative time series and that full multivariate approaches must be used to describe between-area FC from electrophysiological recordings accurately. Moreover, the high correlation between the FC values estimated from EEG and MEG suggests that the results found in the high-sensitivity, low-noise MEG can be transferable to the more affordable EEG, at least when high-quality source reconstruction is used.",

    "abstract": "Camponotus floridanus ants show altered behaviors followed by a fatal summiting phenotype when infected with manipulating Ophiocordyceps camponoti-floridani fungi. Host summiting as a strategy to increase transmission is also observed with parasite taxa beyond fungi, including aquatic and terrestrial helminths and baculoviruses. The drastic phenotypic changes can sometimes reflect significant physiological changes within host cells that span molecular levels from metabolites to nucleic acids. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms still need to be fully characterized. To investigate the small molecules producing summiting behavior, we infected C. floridanus ants with O. camponoti-floridani and sampled their heads for LC-MS/MS when we observed the characteristic summiting phenotype. We link this metabolomic data with our previous genomic and transcriptomic data to propose mechanisms that underlie manipulated summiting behavior in \"zombie ants.\" This \"multiomic\" evidence points toward the dysregulation of neurotransmitter levels and neuronal signaling. We propose that these processes are altered during infection and manipulation based on 1) differential expression of neurotransmitter synthesis and receptor genes, 2) altered abundance of metabolites and neurotransmitters (or their precursors) with known behavioral effects in ants and other insects, and 3) possible suppression of a connected immunity pathway. We additionally report signals for metabolic activity during manipulation related to primary metabolism, detoxification, and anti-stress protectants.",

    "abstract": "RationaleMany blood-based transcriptional gene signatures for tuberculosis (TB) have been developed with potential use to diagnose disease, predict risk of progression from infection to disease, and monitor TB treatment outcomes. However, an unresolved issue is whether gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the signature transcripts alone is sufficient for prediction and differentiation, or whether it is necessary to use the original statistical model created when the signature was derived. Intra-method comparison is complicated by the unavailability of original training data, missing details about the original trained model, and inadequate publicly-available software tools or source code implementing models. To facilitate these signatures replicability and appropriate utilization in TB research, comprehensive comparisons between gene set scoring methods with cross-data validation of original model implementations are needed.\n\nObjectivesWe compared the performance of 19 TB gene signatures across 24 transcriptomic datasets using both re-rebuilt original models and gene set scoring methods to evaluate whether gene set scoring is a reasonable proxy to the performance of the original trained model. We have provided an open-access software implementation of the original models for all 19 signatures for future use.\n\nMethodsWe considered existing gene set scoring and machine learning methods, including ssGSEA, GSVA, PLAGE, Singscore, and Zscore, as alternative approaches to profile gene signature performance. The sample-size-weighted mean area under the curve (AUC) value was computed to measure each signatures performance across datasets. Correlation analysis and Wilcoxon paired tests were used to analyze the performance of enrichment methods with the original models.\n\nMeasurement and Main ResultsFor many signatures, the predictions from gene set scoring methods were highly correlated and statistically equivalent to the results given by the original diagnostic models. PLAGE outperformed all other gene scoring methods. In some cases, PLAGE outperformed the original models when considering signatures weighted mean AUC values and the AUC results within individual studies.\n\nConclusionGene set enrichment scoring of existing blood-based biomarker gene sets can distinguish patients with active TB disease from latent TB infection and other clinical conditions with equivalent or improved accuracy compared to the original methods and models. These data justify using gene set scoring methods of published TB gene signatures for predicting TB risk and treatment outcomes, especially when original models are difficult to apply or implement.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities such as swarms or biofilms often form at the interfaces of solid substrates and open fluid flows. At the same time, in laboratory environments these communities are commonly studied using microfluidic devices with media flows and open boundaries. Extracellular signaling within these communities is therefore subject to different constraints than signaling within classic, closed-boundary systems such as developing embryos or tissues, yet is understudied by comparison. Here, we use mathematical modeling to show how advective-diffusive boundary flows and population geometry impact cell-cell signaling in monolayer microbial communities. We reveal conditions where the intercellular signaling lengthscale depends solely on the population geometry and not on diffusion or degradation, as commonly expected. We further demonstrate that diffusive coupling with the boundary flow can produce signal gradients within an isogenic population, even when there is no flow within the population. We use our theory to provide new insights into the signaling mechanisms of published experimental results, and we make several experimentally verifiable predictions. Our research highlights the importance of carefully evaluating boundary dynamics and environmental geometry when modeling microbial cell-cell signaling and informs the study of cell behaviors in both natural and synthetic systems.\n\nO_TEXTBOXSIGNIFICANCEMicrobial communities in natural environments and microfluidic devices are often exposed to open boundaries and flows, but models used to characterize diffusive signaling in such systems often ignore how device geometry, boundary conditions, and media flow influence signaling behavior. We demonstrate how the effective signaling capacity of these communities can be shaped by population geometry and advective-diffusive boundary flow in quasi-2D environments. Our approach provides a general framework to understand and control advection-reaction-diffusion systems--and their interactions with cellular signaling networks--in both natural and synthetic environments.\n\nC_TEXTBOX",

    "abstract": "Negeviruses that infect insects are recently identified virus species that are phylogenetically related to several plant viruses. They exhibit a unique virion structure, an elliptical core with a short projection. Negeviruses encode two structural proteins, a glycoprotein that forms a short projection, and an envelope protein that forms an elliptical core. The glycoprotein has been reported only in the negeviruses genes, and not in phylogenetically related plant viruses genes. In this report, we first describe the three-dimensional electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of Tanay virus (TANAV), one of the nege-like viruses. TANAV particle demonstrates a periodical envelope structure consisting of three layers surrounding the centered viral RNA. The elliptical core dynamically changes its shape under acidic and even low detergent conditions to form bullet-like or tubular shapes. The further cryo-EM studies on these transformed TANAV particles reveal their overall structural rearrangement. These findings suggest putative geometries of TANAV and its transformation in the life cycle, and the potential importance of the short projection for enabling cell entry to the insect hosts.\n\nImpact statementNegeviridae has recently been declared as a virus family that includes virus species exhibiting a unique particle structure that differs from other known viruses. They are known to be common mosquito viruses isolated around the world, but also phylogenetically related to several plant viruses that impair crop production. Therefore, the negeviruses may also play a role in plant ecosystems that threaten agriculture. However, the mechanism of infection and assembly of the negeviruses as well as their structure were unknown. In this study, intact and dissociated structures of the TANAV were first examined using cryo-EM single particle analysis (SPA) and electron cryo-tomography (cryo-ET). These results reveal new structural geometries of the TANAV particle and its dynamic transformation under acidic and even low-detergent conditions, providing new insights into the infection and assembly mechanism in negeviruses.",

Using in vivo insertional mutagenesis screening in conjunction with cross-species genomic and transcriptomic validation, we identified a strong and consistent signal for neuronal, synaptic, and glutamatergic signaling gene sets in murine and human SCLC. We show that SCLC cells have the ability to develop intimate contacts with neuronal glutamatergic terminals in vitro, in autochthonous primary lung tumors and in brain-engrafted tumors. These contacts can develop into bona fide synapses, allowing SCLC cells to receive glutamatergic inputs. Fitting with a potential oncogenic role of neuron-SCLC interactions, we show that SCLC cells derive a robust proliferation advantage when co-cultured with neurons. Moreover, the repression of glutamate release and the stimulation of the inhibitory glutamate receptor GRM8 displayed therapeutic efficacy in an autochthonous mouse model of SCLC. Therefore, following malignant transformation, SCLC cells appear to hijack glutamatergic signaling to sustain tumor growth, thereby exposing a novel entry route for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "Models to study metastatic disease in rare cancers are needed to advance preclinical therapeutics and to gain insight into disease biology, especially for highly aggressive cancers with a propensity for metastatic spread. Osteosarcoma is a rare cancer with a complex genomic landscape in which outcomes for patients with metastatic disease are poor. As osteosarcoma genomes are highly heterogeneous, a large panel of models is needed to fully elucidate key aspects of disease biology and to recapitulate clinically-relevant phenotypes. We describe the development and characterization of osteosarcoma patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and a panel of PDX-derived cell lines. Matched patient samples, PDXs, and PDX-derived cell lines were comprehensively evaluated using whole genome sequencing and RNA sequencing. PDXs and PDX-derived cell lines largely maintained the expression profiles of the patient from which they were derived despite the emergence of whole-genome duplication (WGD) in a subset of cell lines. These cell line models were heterogeneous in their metastatic capacity and their tissue tropism as observed in both intravenous and orthotopic models. As proof-of-concept study, we used one of these models to test the preclinical effectiveness of a CDK inhibitor on the growth of metastatic tumors in an orthotopic amputation model. Single-agent dinaciclib was effective at dramatically reducing the metastatic burden in this model.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=74 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/524562v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17ea2a8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e8fcc7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2b9f8corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f7b802_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "A multitude of malaria species (genus Plasmodium) infects primates. Due to their public health importance, the human-infective species have garnered the most focus, but increased knowledge of non-human primate malaria species is warranted to improve our evolutionary understanding of host-parasite interactions. Additionally, the broad host tropism of some primate malaria parasites and their realized or theorized zoonotic potential add urgency to understanding of primate-parasite interactions. Here, we use comparative transcriptomics to understand the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) response to two malaria parasites used as analogues to human-infective species of differing severity and which may represent emerging zoonotic threats: P. coatneyi, comparable to human-infective P. falciparum, and P. cynomolgi, comparable to human-infective P. vivax. We first validate our transcriptomics-based proxy of parasite load through comparison to gold-standard microscopy-based measures. We then find that malaria-associated host genes have functional links to immune system regulation and blood cells. Host genes with differing expression by malaria species were more likely to be involved in brain-linked functions, perhaps due to the differential central nervous system involvement of the two parasite species. Such comparative work on primate malaria species may help elucidate the essential and species-specific molecular mechanisms that underlie differing clinical presentations and zoonotic risk.",

However, personal choices are based on private internal values of the rewards at stake. Without indications of an agents private internal value, we do not know whether dopamine neurons, or any reward neurons, encode the internal value. The well-established Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) auction-like mechanism allows participants to place bids for freely stating their private internal value for a good. BDM bids are known to reflect the agents true internal valuation, as inaccurate bidding results in suboptimal reward ( incentive compatibility). In our experiment rhesus monkeys placed BDM bids for juice rewards without specific external constraints. Their bids for physically identical rewards varied trial by trial and increased overall for larger rewards. Responses of midbrain dopamine neurons followed the trial-by-trial variation of bids despite constant, explicitly predicted reward amounts; correspondingly, the dopamine responses were similar when the animal placed similar bids for different reward amounts. Support Vector Regression demonstrated accurate prediction of the animals bids by as few as twenty dopamine neurons, demonstrating the validity of the dopamine code for internal reward value. Thus, dopamine responses reflect the instantaneous internal subjective reward value rather than the value imposed by external stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Biomarker discovery in neurological and psychiatric disorders critically depends on reproducible and transparent methods applied to large-scale datasets. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a promising tool for identifying biomarkers. However, recording, preprocessing, and analysis of EEG data is time-consuming and researcher- dependent. Therefore, we developed DISCOVER-EEG, an open and fully automated pipeline that enables easy and fast preprocessing, analysis, and visualization of resting state EEG data. Data in the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) standard are automatically preprocessed, and physiologically meaningful features of brain function (including oscillatory power, connectivity, and network characteristics) are extracted and visualized using two open-source and widely used Matlab toolboxes (EEGLAB and FieldTrip). We tested the pipeline in two large, openly available datasets, the LEMON dataset, containing 213 EEG recordings of healthy participants, and the TDBRAIN dataset, containing 1274 EEG recordings, mainly from patients with a psychiatric condition. Additionally, we performed an exploratory analysis of the LEMON dataset that could inspire biomarkers of healthy aging. Thus, the DISCOVER-EEG pipeline facilitates the aggregation, reuse, and analysis of large EEG datasets, promoting open and reproducible research on brain function.",

    "abstract": "Global signal fluctuations are a dominant source of variance in spontaneous BOLD activity. These brain-wide signals co-occur with respiratory and other physiological changes. An often-overlooked possibility is that these physiological associations with global BOLD fluctuations are components of a unified physiological process. Here we combine analysis of multi-modal physiological recordings with simultaneous EEG-fMRI data to demonstrate that global BOLD fluctuations are embedded in a physiological network spanning neural, cardiovascular, pulmonary, exocrine (sweat glands) and smooth muscle (pupil dilator) systems. We further show that these co-fluctuations can be initiated by voluntary changes in respiratory rate and depth. We propose that respiratory variability and its concomitant physiological dynamics are essential explanatory ingredients in the origin of global BOLD fluctuations.",

    "abstract": "Statistical power in cognitive neuroimaging experiments is often very low. Low sample size can reduce the likelihood of detecting real effects (false negatives) and increase the risk of detecting non-existing effects by chance (false positives). Here we document our experience of leveraging a relatively unexplored method of collecting a large sample size for simple electroencephalography (EEG) studies: by recording EEG in the community during public engagement and outreach events. We collected data from 346 participants (189 females, age range 6-76 years) over 6 days, totalling 29 hours, at local science festivals. Alpha activity (6-15 Hz) was filtered from 30 seconds of signal, recorded from a single electrode placed between the occipital midline (Oz) and inion (Iz) while participants rested with their eyes closed. A total of 289 good quality datasets were obtained. Using this community-based approach, we were able to replicate controlled, lab-based findings: IAF increased during childhood, reaching a peak frequency of 10.28 Hz at 28.1 years old, and slowed again in middle and older age. Total alpha power decreased linearly, but the aperiodic-adjusted alpha power did not change over the lifespan. Aperiodic slopes and intercepts were highest in the youngest participants. There were no associations between these EEG indexes and self-reported fatigue, measured by the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory. Finally, we present a set of important considerations for researchers who wish to collect EEG data within public engagement and outreach environments.",

    "abstract": "Listening in a noisy environment (e.g., speech in noise) relies on the fundamental ability to extract coherence from the variable sensory input. This allows the detection active sound sources and their segregation of them from the rest of the scene (figure-ground segregation). Peripheral and central causes of age-related decline of listening in noise were assessed by a tone-cloud-based figure detection task. In two conditions differing in the amount of noise, figure detection performance was equalized between young, normal-hearing, and hearing-impaired elderly listeners by adapting the stimulation separately to the abilities of each person. Based on behavioral measures and event-related brain potentials (ERP), in the absence of cognitive deficits, aging alone does not appear to significantly deteriorate the ability to detect sound sources in noise, although ERPs show delayed perceptual processes and some expected deterioration in attention and/or executive functions. However, even mild hearing impairment substantially reduces the ability to segregate individual sound sources within a complex auditory scene, and susceptibility to masking noise increases together with the severity of the hearing deficit.\n\nSignificance StatementThis work provides new information about the contributions of central and peripheral causes to the typical age-related decline of listening in a noisy environment. Behavioral and neurophysiological data collected in a well-controlled model of listening in noise suggest that aging alone does not significantly reduce the ability to detect sound sources in a complex auditory scene. However, even mild hearing impairment significantly reduces this ability. The stimulus paradigm used appears to be quite sensitive to hearing loss, making it potentially useful for the early detection of hearing problems.",

    "abstract": "Studies in neuroscience inspired progress in the design of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and vice versa ANNs have also started to provide new insights into the functioning of brain circuits. So far, the focus has been on how ANNs can help to explain the tuning of neurons at various stages of the visual cortical hierarchy. However, the role of modulatory feedback connections, which play a role in attention and perceptual organization, has not been tested yet. Here, we present a biologically plausible neural network that performs scene segmentation and can shift attention using modulatory feedback connections from higher to lower brain areas. The model replicates several neurophysiological signatures of recurrent processing. Specifically, figural regions elicit more neuronal activity in model units than the background. The modulation of neuronal activity by figure and ground occurs at a delay after the first feedforward response, because it depends on a loop through the higher model areas. Importantly, the enhancement of the figural response is controlled by object-based attention, which stays focused on the figural regions and does not spill over to the adjacent background, as observed in the visual cortex. Our results indicate how progress in deep learning can be used to garner insight into the recurrent cortical processing for scene segmentation and object-based attention.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is an effective treatment for depression, but the neural response to rTMS remains unclear. TMS with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) can probe these neural effects, but variation in TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) across the dlPFC are not well characterized and often obscured by muscle artifact. Mapping TEPs and artifacts across dlPFC targets is needed to identify high fidelity subregions that can be used for rTMS treatment monitoring.\n\nObjectiveTo characterize  early TEPs anatomically and temporally close (20-50 ms) to the TMS pulse and associated muscle artifacts (<20 ms) across the dlPFC. We hypothesized that TMS location and angle would affect these early TEPs and that TEP size would be inversely related to muscle artifact. We sought to identify an optimal TMS target / angle for the group and asked if individualization would be beneficial.\n\nMethodsIn 16 healthy participants, we applied single-pulse TMS to six targets within the dlPFC at two coil angles and measured EEG responses.\n\nResultsEarly TEPs were sensitive to stimulation location, with posterior and medial targets yielding larger early TEPs. Regions with high early TEP amplitude had less muscle artifact, and vice versa. The best group-level target yielded 102% larger TEP responses compared to other standard targets. Optimal TMS target differed across subjects, suggesting that a personalized targeting approach could boost the early TEP by additional 36%.\n\nConclusionsThe early TEPs can be probed without significant muscle-related confounds in posterior-medial regions of the dlPFC.

    "abstract": "Targeting the 4{beta}7-MAdCAM-1 axis with vedolizumab (VDZ) is a front-line therapeutic paradigm in ulcerative colitis (UC). However, mechanism(s) of action (MOA) of VDZ remain relatively undefined. Here, we examined three distinct cohorts of patients with UC (n=83, n=60, and n=21), to determine the effect of VDZ on the mucosal and peripheral immune system. Transcriptomic studies with protein level validation were used to study drug MOA using conventional and transgenic murine models. We found a significant decrease in colonic and ileal naive B and T cells and circulating gut-homing plasmablasts ({beta}7+) in VDZ-treated patients, pointing to gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) targeting by VDZ. Murine Peyers patches (PP) demonstrated a significant loss cellularity associated with reduction in follicular B cells, including a unique population of epithelium-associated B cells, following anti-4{beta}7 antibody (mAb) administration. Photoconvertible (KikGR) mice unequivocally demonstrated impaired cellular entry into PPs in anti-4{beta}7 mAb treated mice. In VDZ-treated, but not anti-tumor necrosis factor-treated UC patients, lymphoid aggregate size was significantly reduced in treatment responders compared to non-responders, with an independent validation cohort further confirming these data. GALT targeting represents a novel MOA of 4{beta}7-targeted therapies, with major implications for this therapeutic paradigm in UC, and for the development of new therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistant bacteria are an emerging and prevalent global threat with an urgent need for alternative therapies. Bacteriophage (phage) therapy is a promising approach to address these infections that has gained renewed interest in recent years. Despite this, questions remain regarding the therapeutic use of phages, including the impact that the immune response may have on phage therapy, particularly when this treatment is administered long-term or when reusing a specific phage treatment in a single individual. To investigate this, we developed a mouse model to assess phage treatment using a cocktail of five phages from the Myoviridae and Siphoviridae families that target vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) gut colonization. Phage cocktail treatment significantly reduced the intestinal bacterial burden of VRE in mice. We characterized innate and adaptive immune responses elicited against the phage cocktail after one and multiple exposures, respectively. While minimal innate responses were observed after phage administration, two courses of phage therapy induced phage-specific neutralizing antibodies and appeared to accelerate phage clearance from tissues. Interestingly, the myophages in our cocktail induced a more robust neutralizing antibody response than the siphophages. Proteins targeted by phage-specific antibodies were also identified from each phage family of the cocktail. Importantly, we show that this anti-phage immunity reduced the effectiveness of the phage cocktail in our murine model, leading to significantly higher fecal bacterial burden following repeat treatment. Collectively, this study shows the immune system has the potential to impede effectiveness of phage therapy and that the phage-specific immune responses can differ significantly between phages. These findings can help inform decisions about inclusion of specific phages in cocktails for future studies.",

    "abstract": "RNA viruses continue to remain a clear and present threat for potential pandemics due to their rapid evolution. To mitigate their impact, we urgently require antiviral agents that can inhibit multiple families of disease-causing viruses, such as arthropod-borne and respiratory pathogens. Potentiating host antiviral pathways can prevent or limit viral infections before escalating into a major outbreak. Therefore, it is critical to identify broad-spectrum antiviral agents. We have tested a small library of innate immune agonists targeting pathogen recognition receptors, including TLRs, STING, NOD, Dectin and cytosolic DNA or RNA sensors. We observed that TLR3, STING, TLR8 and Dectin-1 ligands inhibited arboviruses, Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), West Nile virus (WNV) and Zika virus, to varying degrees. Cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) STING agonists, such as cAIMP, diABZI, and 2,3-cGAMP, and Dectin-1 agonist scleroglucan, demonstrated the most potent, broad-spectrum antiviral function. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed that CHIKV-infected cells had larger number of differentially expressed genes than of WNV and ZIKV. Furthermore, gene expression analysis showed that cAIMP treatment rescued cells from CHIKV-induced dysregulation of cell repair, immune, and metabolic pathways. In addition, cAIMP provided protection against CHIKV in a CHIKV-arthritis mouse model. Cardioprotective effects of synthetic STING ligands against CHIKV, WNV, SARS-CoV-2 and enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) infections were demonstrated using human cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, the direct-acting antiviral drug remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue, was not effective against CHIKV and WNV, but exhibited potent antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2, RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), and EV-D68. Our study identifies broad-spectrum antivirals effective against multiple families of pandemic potential RNA viruses, which can be rapidly deployed to prevent or mitigate future pandemics.",

    "abstract": "YciF (STM14_2092) is a member of domain of unknown function (DUF892) family. It is an uncharacterized protein, involved in stress responses in Salmonella Typhimurium. In this study, we investigated the significance of YciF and its DUF892 domain during bile and oxidative stress responses of S. Typhimurium. Purified wild type YciF forms higher order oligomers, binds to iron and displays ferroxidase activity. Studies on the site-specific mutants revealed that the ferroxidase activity of YciF is dependent on the two metal binding sites present within the DUF892 domain. Transcriptional analysis displayed that the {Delta}cspE strain, which has compromised expression of YciF, encounters iron toxicity due to dysregulation of iron homeostasis in presence of bile. Utilizing this observation, we demonstrate that the bile mediated iron toxicity in {Delta}cspE causes lethality, primarily through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Expression of wild type YciF, but not the three mutants of the DUF892 domain, in {Delta}cspE alleviate ROS in presence of bile. Our results establish the role of YciF as a ferroxidase that can sequester excess iron in the cellular milieu to counter ROS-associated cell death. In fact, pre-treatment with an iron chelator mitigates the hypersensitivity of {Delta}cspE to bile.\n\nImportanceThe DUF892 domain has a wide taxonomic distribution encompassing several bacterial pathogens. This domain belongs to the ferritin-like superfamily; however, it has not been biochemically and functionally characterized. This is the first report of characterization of a member of this family. In this study, we demonstrate that S. Typhimurium YciF is an iron binding protein with ferroxidase activity, which is dependent on the metal binding sites present within the DUF892 domain. It combats iron toxicity and oxidative damage caused due to exposure to bile. The functional characterization of YciF delineates the significance of the DUF892 domain in bacteria. In addition, our studies on S. Typhimurium bile stress response divulged the importance of comprehensive iron homeostasis in bacteria in presence of bactericidal compounds that tend to generate ROS irrespective of their primary targets.",

    "abstract": "Throughout biology, RNA molecules form complex networks of molecular interactions that are central to their function, but remain challenging to investigate. Here, we introduce Oligonucleotide-mediated proximity-interactome MAPping (O-MAP), a straightforward method for elucidating the biomolecules near an RNA of interest, within its native cellular context. O-MAP uses programmable oligonucleotide probes to deliver proximity-biotinylating enzymes to a target RNA, enabling nearby molecules to be enriched by streptavidin pulldown. O-MAP induces exceptionally precise RNA-localized in situ biotinylation, and unlike alternative methods it enables straightforward optimization of its targeting accuracy. Using the 47S pre-ribosomal RNA and long noncoding RNA Xist as models, we develop O-MAP workflows for unbiased discovery of RNA-proximal proteins, transcripts, and genomic loci. This revealed unexpected co-compartmentalization of Xist and other chromatin-regulatory RNAs and enabled systematic characterization of nucleolar-chromatin interactions across multiple cell lines. O-MAP is portable to cultured cells, organoids, and tissues, and to RNAs of various lengths, abundances, and sequence composition. And, O-MAP requires no genetic manipulation and uses exclusively off-the-shelf parts. We therefore anticipate its application to a broad array of RNA phenomena.",

    "abstract": "Precise control of pluripotency is a requirement for the safe and effective use of hPSCs in research and therapies. Here we report that pyruvate dehydrogenase upregulates histone H3 pan acetylation and levels of pluripotency marker NANOG in 5% O2. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is an essential metabolic switch and a bottleneck for the glycolytic production of acetyl-CoA. Silencing of gene expression showed that PDH is regulated by the activity of its phosphatase PDP1. We show that PDP1 is sensitive to reactive oxygen species-mediated inactivation, leading to the downregulation of H3 pan acetylation and NANOG levels. Furthermore, we show that FGF2, a cytokine commonly used to maintain pluripotency activates pyruvate dehydrogenase through MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling pathway-mediated downregulation of ROS in 5% O2, thus promoting histone acetylation. Our results show the importance of pyruvate dehydrogenase in regulating energy metabolism and its connection to pluripotency. Furthermore, our data highlight the role of reactive oxygen species and redox homeostasis in pluripotency maintenance and differentiation.\n\nHighlights- PDP1-induced activation of PDH leads to increased histone H3 pan acetylation and NANOG levels in hPSCs\n- Reactive oxygen species (ROS) inactivate PDP1 and decrease histone H3 pan acetylation and NANOG levels in hPSCs\n- MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling-mediated downregulation of ROS in 5% O2 activates PDH in hPSCs\n\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=129 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/524871v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (39K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@133f8dcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1176d94org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11b153corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10f2e4d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The distribution of runs of homozygosity (ROH) may be shaped by a number of interacting processes such as selection, recombination and population history, but little is known about the importance of these mechanisms in shaping ROH in wild populations. We combined an empirical dataset of >3,000 red deer genotyped at >35,000 genome-wide autosomal SNPs and evolutionary simulations to investigate the influence of each of these factors on ROH. We assessed ROH number and location in two populations of red deer (a focal and comparison) to investigate the effect of population history. We investigated the role of recombination using both a physical map and a genetic linkage map to search for ROH. We found differences in ROH distribution between both populations and both map types indicating that population history and local recombination rate have a substantial effect on ROH. Finally, we ran forward genetic simulations with varying population histories, recombination rates and levels of selection, allowing us to further interpret our empirical data. These simulations showed that population history has a greater effect on ROH distribution than either recombination or selection. We further show that selection can cause genomic regions where ROH are common, so called ROH hotspots, only when the effective population size (Ne) is large or selection is particularly strong. In populations having undergone a population bottleneck, genetic drift can outweigh the effect of selection. We show that most ROH hotspots in the Rum population are in line with expectations from neutral simulations, however two ROH hotspots show possible signatures of selection. Overall, we conclude that in this population, genetic drift resulting from a historical population bottleneck is most likely to have resulted in the observed ROH distribution, with selection possibly playing a minor role.",

Both hydrophobic and hydrophilic chemical and biological drugs can be functionalized or adsorbed onto GQDs by {pi}-{pi} stacking and van der Waals interactions.

    "abstract": "The ribosome is a large ribonucleoprotein assembly that uses diverse and complex molecular interactions to maintain proper folding. In vivo assembled ribosomes have been isolated using MS2-tags installed in either the 16S or 23S ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), to enable studies of ribosome structure and function in vitro. RNA tags in the Escherichia coli 50S subunit have commonly been inserted into an extended helix H98 in 23S rRNA, as this addition does not affect cellular growth or in vitro ribosome activity. Here, we find that E. coli 50S subunits with MS2 tags inserted in H98 are destabilized compared to wild type (WT) 50S subunits. We identify the loss of RNA-RNA tertiary contacts that bridge helices H1, H94, and H98 as the cause of destabilization. Using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we show that this interaction is disrupted by the addition of the MS2 tag and can be restored through the insertion of a single adenosine in the extended H98 helix. This work establishes ways to improve MS2 tags in the 50S subunit that maintain ribosome stability and investigates a complex RNA tertiary structure that may be important for stability in various bacterial ribosomes.",

There are significant discrepancies in the reported amounts of many proteins supporting this process, particularly those of low abundance, which limits our understanding of their molecular organization and function. In this study, we used quantitative mass spectrometry to simultaneously determine the abundances of twenty key structural and functional proteins residing in mouse rod outer segments. We computed the absolute number of molecules of each protein residing within an individual outer segment and the molar ratio amongst all twenty proteins. The molar ratios of proteins comprising three well-characterized constitutive complexes in outer segments differed from the established subunit stoichiometries of these complexes by less than 7%, highlighting the exceptional precision of our quantification. Overall, this study resolves multiple existing discrepancies regarding the outer segment abundances of these proteins, thereby advancing our understanding of how the phototransduction pathway functions as a single, well-coordinated molecular ensemble.",

    "abstract": "Tunable culture platforms that guide cellular organization and mechanically stimulate skeletal muscle development are still unavailable due to limitations in biocompatibility and actuation triggered without contact. This study reports the rational design and fabrication of magneto-active microfiber meshes with controlled hexagonal microstructures via melt electrowriting (MEW) of a thermoplastic/graphene/iron oxide composite. In situ deposition of iron oxide nanoparticles on oxidized graphene yielded homogeneously dispersed magnetic particles with sizes above 0.5 m and low aspect ratio, preventing cellular internalization and toxicity. With these fillers, homogeneous magnetic composites with very high magnetic filler content (up to 10 wt.%) were obtained and successfully processed in a solvent-free manner for the first time. MEW of magnetic composites enabled the skeletal muscle-inspired design of hexagonal scaffolds with tunable fiber diameter, reconfigurable modularity, and zonal distribution of magneto-active and nonactive material. Importantly, the hexagonal microstructures displayed elastic deformability under tension, mitigating the mechanical limitations due to high filler content. External magnetic fields below 300 mT were sufficient to trigger out-of-plane reversible deformation leading to effective end-to-end length decrease up to 17%. Moreover, C2C12 myoblast culture on 3D Matrigel/collagen/MEW scaffolds showed that the presence of magnetic particles in the scaffolds did not significantly affect viability after 8 days with respect to scaffolds without magnetic filler. Importantly, in vitro culture demonstrated that myoblasts underwent differentiation at similar rates regardless of the presence of magnetic filler. Overall, these innovative microfiber scaffolds were proven as a magnetically deformable platform suitable for dynamic culture of skeletal muscle with potential for in vitro disease modeling.",

    "abstract": "A complex interplay between mRNA translation and cellular respiration has been recently unveiled, but its regulation in humans is poorly characterized in either health or disease. Cancer cells radically reshape both biosynthetic and bioenergetic pathways to sustain their aberrant growth rates. In this regard, we have shown that the molecular chaperone TRAP1 not only regulates the activity of respiratory complexes, behaving alternatively as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor, but also plays a concomitant moonlighting function in mRNA translation regulation. Herein we identify the molecular mechanisms involved, demonstrating that TRAP1: i) binds both mitochondrial and cytosolic ribosomes as well as translation elongation factors, ii) slows down translation elongation rate, and iii) favors localized translation in the proximity of mitochondria. We also provide evidence that TRAP1 is coexpressed in human tissues with the mitochondrial translational machinery, which is responsible for the synthesis of respiratory complex proteins. Altogether, our results show an unprecedented level of complexity in the regulation of cancer cell metabolism, strongly suggesting the existence of a tight feedback loop between protein synthesis and energy metabolism, based on the demonstration that a single molecular chaperone plays a role in both mitochondrial and cytosolic translation, as well as in mitochondrial respiration.",

    "abstract": "In the human brain, aversive and appetitive processing have been studied with controlled stimuli in rather static settings. In addition, the extent to which aversive- and appetitive-related processing engage distinct or overlapping circuits remains poorly understood. Here, we sought to investigate the dynamics of aversive and appetitive processing while male and female participants engaged in comparable trials involving threat-avoidance or reward-seeking. A central goal was to characterize the temporal evolution of responses during periods of threat or reward imminence. For example, in the aversive domain, we predicted that the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST), but not the amygdala, would exhibit anticipatory responses given the role of the former in anxious apprehension. We also predicted that the periaqueductal gray (PAG) would exhibit threat-proximity responses based on its involvement in proximal-threat processes, and that the ventral striatum would exhibit threat-imminence responses given its role in threat escape in rodents. Overall, we uncovered imminence-related temporally increasing (\"ramping\") responses in multiple brain regions, including the BST, PAG, and ventral striatum, subcortically, and dorsal anterior insula and anterior midcingulate, cortically. Whereas the ventral striatum generated anticipatory responses in the proximity of reward as expected, it also exhibited threat-related imminence responses. In fact, across multiple brain regions, we observed a main effect of arousal. In other words, we uncovered extensive temporally-evolving, imminence-related processing in both the aversive and appetitive domain, suggesting that distributed brain circuits are dynamically engaged during the processing of biologically relevant information irrespective of valence, findings further supported by network analysis.\n\nSignificance StatementIn the human brain, aversive and appetitive processing have been studied with controlled stimuli in rather static settings.

Other species also signal vocal identity in calls, such as shown in the contact call of parrots. However, it remains unclear to what extent other call types in parrots are individually distinct, and whether there is an analogous voice-print across calls. Here we test if an individual signature is present in other call types, how stable this signature is, and if parrots exhibit voice-prints across call types. We recorded 5599 vocalisations from 229 individually-marked monk parakeets (Myiopsitta monachus) over a two year period in Barcelona, Spain. We examined five distinct call types, finding evidence for an individual signature in three. We further show that in the contact call, while birds are individually distinct, the calls are more variable than previously assumed, changing over short time scales (seconds to minutes). Finally, we provide evidence for voice-prints across multiple call types, with a discriminant function being able to predict caller identity across call types. This suggests that monk parakeets may be able to use vocal cues to recognise conspecifics, even across vocalisation types and without necessarily needing active vocal signatures of identity.",

Using supervised experiments, we show that SCORPION can accurately identify differences in regulatory networks between wild-type and transcription factor-perturbed cells.

C4A expression also increased microglia-mediated synaptic uptake in the NICO model, supporting the hypothesis that synapse and brain volume loss in SCZ patients may be due to excessive microglial pruning. Our results highlight the role of C4A in the immunogenetic risk factors for SCZ and provide a human model for phenotypic discovery and validation of immunomodulating therapies.",
