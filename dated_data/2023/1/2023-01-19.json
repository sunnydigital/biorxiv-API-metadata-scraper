    "abstract": "BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented amount of scientific publications, growing at a pace never seen before. Multiple living systematic reviews have been developed to assist professionals with up-to-date and trustworthy health information, but it is increasingly challenging for systematic reviewers to keep up with the evidence in electronic databases. We aimed to investigate deep learning-based machine learning algorithms to classify COVID-19 related publications to help scale-up the epidemiological curation process.\n\nMethodsIn this retrospective study, five different pre-trained deep learning-based language models were fine-tuned on a dataset of 6,365 publications manually classified into two classes, three subclasses and 22 sub-subclasses relevant for epidemiological triage purposes. In a k-fold cross-validation setting, each standalone model was assessed on a classification task and compared against an ensemble, which takes the standalone model predictions as input and uses different strategies to infer the optimal article class. A ranking task was also considered, in which the model outputs a ranked list of sub-subclasses associated with the article.\n\nResultsThe ensemble model significantly outperformed the standalone classifiers, achieving a F1-score of 89.2 at the class level of the classification task. The difference between the standalone and ensemble models increases at the sub-subclass level, where the ensemble reaches a micro F1-score of 70% against 67% for the best performing standalone model. For the ranking task, the ensemble obtained the highest recall@3, with a performance of 89%. Using an unanimity voting rule, the ensemble can provide predictions with higher confidence on a subset of the data, achieving detection of original papers with a F1-score up to 97% on a subset of 80% of the collection instead of 93% on the whole dataset.\n\nConclusionThis study shows the potential of using deep learning language models to perform triage of COVID-19 references efficiently and support epidemiological curation and review. The ensemble consistently and significantly outperforms any standalone model. Fine-tuning the voting strategy thresholds is an interesting alternative to annotate a subset with higher predictive confidence.",

    "abstract": "Tumor occurrence and progression are significantly influenced by immunity, and the immune infiltration and immune-related gene expression in solid tumors are closely correlated to the response of patients to immunotherapy. In this study, the level of tumor infiltrating immune cells in gastric cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma samples from the TCGA database were assessed using ssGSEA, and the tumor samples were divided into two subtypes (Imm_H and Imm_L) with different immune cell infiltration level. The differences in immune cell percentage and immune checkpoint gene expression between the two subtypes indicated that the Imm_H group had higher levels of immune infiltration, but also more infiltrated immunosuppressive cells and higher mRNA levels of immune checkpoint genes. Then the immune subtype-specific gene network was built and the main modules representing the genes and functions that differ between the two immune subtypes were identified. To explore the effect of oncolytic virus on tumor immune microenvironment, we constructed the previously developed synthetic adenovirus containing the synthetic sensory switch gene circuit, assessed the antitumor effect in mouse models, and measured the proportion of different cell types by single-cell RNA sequencing. The results showed that synthetic oncolytic virus inhibited tumor development and altered the proportion of infiltrating immune cells, suggesting that synthetic oncolytic virus may have different mechanism on the two immune subtypes.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=168 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/524374v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dffa9dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@be8e2eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@68acf6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@33862f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

We first performed molecular docking simulation analyses of the spike proteins with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to determine the binding affinities to human cells of three new variants of SARS-CoV-2: Omicron BQ.1, XBB, and XBB.1.5 We then investigated the three variants to discover the evolutionary distance of the spike protein gene (S gene) from the Wuhan, Omicron BA.1, and Omicron BA.4/5 variants, to understand the changes in the S gene.\n\nThe results indicated that the XBB.1.5 variant had the highest binding affinity of the spike protein with ACE2 and the longest evolutionary distance of the S gene. This in silico evidence suggested that the XBB.1.5 variant may produce infections that spread more widely and faster than can infections of preexisting variants.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, a novel treatment method for cancer emerged, which is based on the starvation of tumors of amino acids like arginine. The deprivation of arginine in serum is based on enzymatic degradation and can be realized by arginine deaminases like the L-amino acid oxidase found in the ink toxin of the sea hare Aplysia punctata. Previously isolated from the ink, the L-amino acids oxidase was described to oxidate the essential amino acid L-lysine and L-arginine to their corresponding deaminated alpha-keto acids. Here, we present the recombinant production and functionalization of amino acid oxidase Aplysia Punctata ink toxin (APIT). PEGylated APIT (APIT-PEG) increased the blood circulation time. APIT-PEG treatment of patient-derived xenografted mice shows a significant dose dependent reduction of tumor growth over time mediated by amino acid starvation of the tumor. Treatment of mice with APIT-PEG which lead to deprivation of arginine was well tolerated.\n\nSignificanceInhibiting the growth of human head and neck cancer in a mouse model by the depletion of amino acids L-lysine and L-arginine provides proof of principle for tumor therapy based on APIT-PEG.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=159 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/524398v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@24a720org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@584ae0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9be883org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1be2d4a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Despite a strong rationale for why cancer cells are susceptible to redox-targeting drugs, such drugs often face tumor resistance or dose-limiting toxicity in preclinical and clinical studies. An important reason is the lack of specific biomarkers to better select susceptible cancer entities and stratify patients. Using a large panel of lung cancer cell lines, we identified a set of \"antioxidant-capacity\" biomarkers (ACB), which were tightly repressed, partly by STAT3 and STAT5A/B in sensitive cells, rendering them susceptible to multiple redox-targeting and ferroptosis-inducing drugs. Contrary to expectation, constitutively low ACB expression was not associated with an increased steady state level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) but a high level of nitric oxide, which is required to sustain high replication rates. Using ACBs, we identified cancer entities with a high percentage of patients with favorable ACB expression pattern, making it likely that more responders to ROS-inducing drugs could be stratified for clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "MFT is an important regulator of seed dormancy in flowering plants. A natural mutation in the A-box motif in the promoter of wheat (Triticum aestivum) MFT2 on chromosome 3A (TaMFT2-3A) has been used to prevent pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) in wheat cultivars in East Asia. Previous research using in situ hybridization showed that TaMFT2-3A is primarily expressed in the seed scutellum. In this study, we analyzed the localization of transcripts and encoded proteins for the TaMFT2 homologs from barley (Hordeum vulgare) and rice (Oryza sativa), HvMFT2 and OsMFT2, respectively. RNA in situ hybridization showed that, like the wheat genes, the rice and barley homologs are primarily expressed in the scutellum, indicating that these three MFT2 genes have a common expression pattern during seed development. Analysis of the cis-acting regulatory elements of their promoter sequences showed that the three MFT2 promoters share eight seed-specific cis-acting RY motifs, which are binding sites for B3-domain transcription factors of the AFL-B3 and VIVIPAROUS1/ABI3-LIKE (VAL) families. In addition, we detected tandemly repeated and partially overlapping A-box motifs in the promoters of HvMFT2, TaMFT2-3B, and TaMFT2-3D, possibly explaining why the natural allele of TaMFT2-3A has been employed in breeding. We generated transgenic rice plants expressing nuclear-localized green fluorescent protein (NLS-2xGFP) and OsMFT2-GFP under the control of a 3-kb fragment of the OsMFT2 promoter. Immunohistochemical staining using anti-GFP antibodies mainly detected GFP in the scutellum and scutellar epithelium, which is an important tissue for initiating germination upon seed hydration. We confirmed these results by confocal microscopy of GFP fluorescence in seeds. Our results suggest that MFT2 expression in rice, barley, and wheat might be regulated by a similar network of transcription factors through multi-RY motifs in the MFT2 promoters, with possible roles in scutellar epithelium development.",

To identify molecular pathways that contribute to synaptic diversity, single neuron PatchSeq RNA profiling was performed on Drosophila tonic and phasic glutamatergic motoneurons. Tonic motoneurons form weaker facilitating synapses onto single muscles, while phasic motoneurons form stronger depressing synapses onto multiple muscles. Super-resolution microscopy and in vivo imaging demonstrated synaptic active zones in phasic motoneurons are more compact and display enhanced Ca2+ influx compared to their tonic counterparts. Genetic analysis identified unique synaptic properties that mapped onto gene expression differences for several cellular pathways, including distinct signaling ligands, post-translational modifications and intracellular Ca2+ buffers. These findings provide insights into how unique transcriptomes drive functional and morphological differences between neuronal subtypes.",

    "abstract": "Memory consolidation involves discrete patterns of transcriptional events in the hippocampus. Despite the emergence of single-cell transcriptomic profiling techniques, defining learning-responsive gene expression across subregions of the hippocampus has remained challenging. Here, we utilized unbiased spatial sequencing to elucidate transcriptome-wide changes in gene expression in the hippocampus following learning, enabling us to define molecular signatures unique to each hippocampal subregion. We find that each subregion of the hippocampus exhibits distinct yet overlapping transcriptomic signatures. Although the CA1 region exhibited increased expression of genes related to transcriptional regulation, the DG showed upregulation of genes associated with protein folding. We demonstrate the functional relevance of subregion-specific gene expression by genetic manipulation of a transcription factor selectively in the CA1 hippocampal subregion, leading to long-term memory deficits. This work demonstrates the power of using spatial molecular approaches to reveal transcriptional events during memory consolidation.",

Whether cardiac-innervating stellate ganglionic neurons (SGNs) exhibit diversity and distinction from those innervating other tissues is not known. To identify and resolve the transcriptomic profiles of SGNs innervating the heart we leveraged retrograde tracing techniques using adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing fluorescent proteins (GFP or Td-tomato) with single cell RNA sequencing. We investigated electrophysiologic, morphologic, and physiologic roles for subsets of cardiac-specific neurons and found that three of five adrenergic SGN subtypes innervate the heart. These three subtypes stratify into two subpopulations; high (NA1a) and low (NA1b and NA1c) Npy-expressing cells, exhibit distinct morphological, neurochemical, and electrophysiologic characteristics. In physiologic studies in transgenic mouse models modulating NPY signaling, we identified differential control of cardiac responses by these two subpopulations to high and low stress states. These findings provide novel insights into the unique properties of neurons responsible for cardiac sympathetic regulation, with implications for novel strategies to target specific neuronal subtypes for sympathetic blockade in cardiac disease.",

Genetic blockade of OL differentiation and neo-myelination in Myrf conditional-knockout mice strongly impaired training-induced improvements in maze performance. Remarkably, there was a strong positive correlation between working memory performance of individual mice and the scale of OLP proliferation and OL generation during training, but not with the number or intensity of c-Fos+ neurons in the mPFC, underscoring the key role of OL lineage cells in cognitive performance.",

    "abstract": "The most prominent role of motor cortex is generating patterns of neural activity that lead to movement, but it is also active when we simply imagine movements in the absence of actual motor output. Despite decades of behavioral and imaging studies, it is unknown how the specific activity patterns and temporal dynamics within motor cortex during covert motor imagery relate to those during motor execution. Here we recorded intracortical activity from the motor cortex of two people with residual wrist function following incomplete spinal cord injury as they performed both actual and imagined isometric wrist extensions. We found that we could decompose the population-level activity into orthogonal subspaces such that one set of components was similarly active during both action and imagery, and others were only active during a single task type--action or imagery. Although they inhabited orthogonal neural dimensions, the action-unique and imagery-unique subspaces contained a strikingly similar set of dynamical features. Our results suggest that during motor imagery, motor cortex maintains the same overall population dynamics as during execution by recreating the missing components related to motor output and/or feedback within a unique imagery-only subspace.",

However, cumulative evidence indicates that the retina can also be functionally altered with consequences for visual function and circadian rhythms. The retina is the most exposed part of the central nervous system that can be used for monitoring the health status of patients using noninvasive techniques. To establish the retina as an appropriate tissue for HD studies, we linked the retinal alterations with those in the inner brain. We confirmed the malfunction of the R6/1 retinas, which underwent a rearrangement of their transcriptome as extensive as in the striatum, indicating a profound retinal affectation in HD. Tissue-enriched genes were downregulated in both areas, but a neuroinflammation signature was specifically induced in the R6/1 retina due to glial activation that was reminiscent of the situation in HD patients brains. These phenomena were confirmed in the zQ175 strain, and were accompanied by a differential impairment of the autophagy system between both tissues. Overall, these results demonstrated the suitability of the mouse retina as a research model for HD.",

Less is known about how RS and subclinical SU relate to striatal function during social rewards (e.g., positive peer feedback). Testing this relation is critical towards predicting risk for development of SU disorder. In this pre-registered study, participants (N=44) underwent fMRI while completing well-matched tasks that assess neural response to reward in social and monetary domains. Contrary to our hypotheses, aberrant RS blunted the relationship between SU and striatal activation during receipt of rewards, regardless of domain. Moreover, exploratory whole-brain analyses showed unique relations between SU and social rewards in temporoparietal junction. Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis demonstrated that aberrant RS is associated with increased connectivity between the VS and ventromedial prefrontal cortex during social rewards. Finally, we found that SU was associated with decreased connectivity between the VS and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex for social rewards, independent of RS. These findings demonstrate nuanced relations between RS and SU, even among those without SU disorder, and suggest altered reward-related engagement in cortico-VS as potential predictors of developing disordered behavior.",

    "abstract": "Members of the tunicates, a subphylum of marine filter-feeder chordates, inhabit all marine and oceanic habitats from the subtidal to the abyssal. Considered as the closest relatives to the vertebrates, the tunicates are widely used as model organisms for evo-devo, allorecognition, senescence, and whole-body regeneration studies. Yet, species boundaries are poorly understood due to high morphological and genetic plasticity that characterize many tunicates taxa. Here we study taxonomy and the distribution of eight tunicate species (Botrylloides niger Herdman, 1886/ aff. leachii, Botrylloides israeliense Brunetti, 2009, Botrylloides sp., Botrylloides anceps (Herdman, 1891), Botryllus schlosseri (Pallas, 1766), Didemnum perlucidum Monniot F., 1983, Symplegma brakenhielmi (Michaelsen, 1904) and Polyclinum constellatum Savigny, 1816) sampled from six Turkish North Eastern Mediterranean Sea sites and employed the mitochondrial barcoding marker (COI) for evaluating the relationships among geographically restricted and widely spread ascidian species. Species delimitation analysis was conducted using NCBI and the present study sequences. Morphological examinations were first done in the field and then, styelide colonies were cultured in the laboratory and studied using stereo and light microscopes. A putative new Botrylloides species (Botrylloides sp.) from the Antalya region was revealed, with 99% matching on the COI gene from Saudi Arabia, further awaiting for detailed traditional taxonomy.",

Here, we screened for coronaviruses in 48 faecal samples from 16 of the 17 bat species breeding in the UK, collected through a bat rehabilitation and conservationist network. We recovered nine (two novel) complete genomes across six bat species: four alphacoronaviruses, a MERS-related betacoronavirus, and four closely related sarbecoviruses. We demonstrate that at least one of these sarbecoviruses can bind and use the human ACE2 receptor for infecting human cells, albeit suboptimally. Additionally, the spike proteins of these sarbecoviruses possess an R-A-K-Q motif, which lies only one nucleotide mutation away from a furin cleavage site (FCS) that enhances infectivity in other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. However, mutating this motif to an FCS does not enable spike cleavage. Overall, while UK sarbecoviruses would require further molecular adaptations to infect humans, their zoonotic risk is unknown and warrants closer surveillance.",

Traditionally, its cellular organization is investigated using dissected lenses, which eliminates in vivo environmental and structural support. Here, we demonstrated that two-photon fluorescence microscopy (2PFM) can visualize lens cells in vivo. To maintain subcellular resolution at depth, we employed adaptive optics (AO) to correct aberrations due to ocular and lens tissues, which led to substantial signal and resolution improvements. Imaging lens cells up to 980 m deep, we observed novel cellular organizations including suture-associated voids, enlarged vacuoles, and large cavities, contrary to the conventional view of a highly ordered organization. We tracked these features longitudinally over weeks and observed the incorporation of new cells during growth. Taken together, non-invasive longitudinal in vivo imaging of lens morphology using AO 2PFM will allow us to directly observe the development or alterations of lens cellular organization in living animals.",

    "abstract": "The scoring models used for protein structure modeling and ranking are mainly divided into unified field and protein-specific scoring functions. Although protein structure prediction has made tremendous progress since CASP14, the modeling accuracy still cannot meet the requirements to a certain extent. Especially, accurate modeling of multi-domain and orphan proteins remains a challenge. Therefore, an accurate and efficient protein scoring model should be developed urgently to guide the protein structure folding or ranking through deep learning. In this work, we propose a protein structure global scoring model based on equivariant graph neural network (EGNN), named GraphGPSM, to guide protein structure modeling and ranking. We construct an EGNN architecture, and a message passing mechanism is designed to update and transmit information between nodes and edges of the graph. Finally, the global score of the protein model is output through a multilayer perceptron. Residue-level ultrafast shape recognition is used to describe the relationship between residues and the overall structure topology, and distance and direction encoded by Gaussian radial basis functions are designed to represent the overall topology of the protein backbone. These two features are combined with Rosetta energy terms, backbone dihedral angles, and inter-residue distance and orientations to represent the protein model and embedded into the nodes and edges of the graph neural network. The experimental results on the CASP13, CASP14, and CAMEO test sets show that the scores of our developed GraphGPSM have a strong correlation with the TM-score of the models, which are significantly better than those of the unified field score function REF2015 and the state-of-the-art local lDDT-based scoring models ModFOLD8, ProQ3D, and DeepAccNet etc. The modeling experimental results on 484 test proteins demonstrate that GraphGPSM can greatly improve the modeling accuracy. GraphGPSM is further used to model 35 orphan proteins and 57 multi-domain proteins. The results show that the average TM-score of the models predicted by GraphGPSM is 13.2% and 7.1% higher than that of the models predicted by AlphaFold2. GraphGPSM also participates in CASP15 and achieves competitive performance in global accuracy estimation.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we built machine learning classifiers for predicting the presence or absence of the variable genes occurring in 10-90% of all publicly available high-quality Escherichia coli genomes. The BV-BRC genus-specific protein families were used to define orthologs across the set of genomes, and a single binary classifier was built for predicting the presence or absence of each family in each genome. Each model was built using the nucleotide k-mers from a set of 100 conserved genes as features. The resulting set of 3,259 XGBoost classifiers had a per-genome average macro F1 score of 0.944 [0.943-0.945, 95% CI]. We show that the F1 scores are stable across MLSTs, and that the trend can be recapitulated through sampling with a smaller number of core genes or diverse input genomes. Surprisingly, the presence or absence of poorly annotated proteins, including \"hypothetical proteins\", were easily predicted (F1 = 0.902 [0.898-0.906, 95% CI]). Models for proteins with horizontal gene transfer-related functions, including transposition- (F1 = 0.895 [0.882-0.907, 95% CI]), phage- (F1 = 0.872 [0.868-0.876, 95% CI]), and plasmid-related (F1 = 0.824 [0.814-0.834, 95% CI]) functions had slightly lower F1 scores, but were still accurate. Finally, we applied the models to a holdout set of 419 diverse E. coli genomes that were isolated from freshwater environmental sources and observed an average per-genome F1 score of 0.880 [0.876-0.883, 95% CI], demonstrating the extensibility of the models. Overall, this study provides a framework for predicting variable gene content using a limited amount of input sequence data.\n\nImportanceHaving the ability to predict the protein-encoding gene content of a genome is important for a variety of bioinformatic tasks, including assessing genome quality, binning genomes from shotgun metagenomic assemblies, and assessing risk due to the presence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and other virulence genes. In this study, we built a series of binary classifiers for predicting the presence or absence of variable genes occurring in 10-90% of all publicly available E. coli genomes. Overall, the results show that a large portion of the E. coli variable gene content can be predicted with high accuracy, including genes with functions relating to horizontal gene transfer.",

First, AMC-109 self-assembles into stable aggregates with specificity for negatively charged membranes. Second, by incorporation into the S. aureus membrane the lateral membrane organization is affected, dissolving membrane nanodomains. Domain dissolution affects membrane functions such as protein sorting and cell wall synthesis, and is suggested to cause a loss of resistance of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) to methicillin.

Here, we used a high-throughput phenotypic small molecule screen to identify MCB-613 as a compound that selectively targets EGFR-mutant, EGFR inhibitor-resistant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells harboring diverse resistance mechanisms. Subsequent proteomic and functional genomic screens involving MCB-613 identified its target in this context to be KEAP1, revealing that this gene is selectively essential in the setting of EGFR inhibitor resistance. In-depth molecular characterization demonstrated that (1) MCB-613 binds KEAP1 covalently; (2) a single molecule of MCB-613 is capable of bridging two KEAP1 monomers together; and, (3) this modification interferes with the degradation of canonical KEAP1 substrates such as NRF2. Surprisingly, NRF2 knockout sensitizes cells to MCB-613, suggesting that the drug functions through modulation of an alternative KEAP1 substrate. Together, these findings advance MCB-613 as a new tool for exploiting the selective essentiality of KEAP1 in drug-resistant, EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells.",

They are found in approximately 14% of all proteins and are implicated in diverse biological functions facilitating both structured and disordered protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. These functionalities make protein TR domains an attractive component for the modular design of protein constructs. However, the repetitive nature of DNA sequences encoding TR motifs complicates their synthesis and mutagenesis by traditional molecular biology workflows commonly employed by protein engineers and synthetic biologists. To address this challenge, we developed a computational protocol to significantly reduce the complementarity of DNA sequences encoding TRs called TReSR (for Tandem Repeat DNA Sequence Redesign). The utility of TReSR was demonstrated by constructing a novel constitutive repressor synthesized by duplicating the LacI DNA binding domain into a single-chain TR construct by assembly PCR. Repressor function was evaluated by expression of a fluorescent reporter delivered on a single plasmid encoding a three-component genetic circuit. The successful application of TReSR to construct a novel TR-containing repressor with a DNA sequence that is amenable to PCR-based construction and manipulation will enable the incorporation of a wide range of TR-containing proteins for protein engineering and synthetic biology applications.",

    "abstract": "Bromodomain-containing Protein 4 (BRD4) is a transcriptional regulator which coordinates gene expression programs controlling cancer biology, inflammation, and fibrosis. In airway viral infection, non-toxic BRD4-specific inhibitors (BRD4i) block the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and prevent downstream remodeling. Although the chromatin modifying functions of BRD4 in inducible gene expression have been extensively investigated, its roles in post-transcriptional regulation are not as well understood. Based on its interaction with the transcriptional elongation complex and spliceosome, we hypothesize that BRD4 is a functional regulator of mRNA processing. To address this question, we combine data-independent analysis - parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation (diaPASEF) with RNA-sequencing to achieve deep and integrated coverage of the proteomic and transcriptomic landscapes of human small airway epithelial cells exposed to viral challenge and treated with BRD4i. The transcript-level data was further interrogated for alternative splicing analysis, and the resulting data sets were correlated to identify pathways subject to post-transcriptional regulation. We discover that BRD4 regulates alternative splicing of key genes, including Interferon-related Developmental Regulator 1 (IFRD1) and X-Box Binding Protein 1 (XBP1), related to the innate immune response and the unfolded protein response, respectively. These findings extend the transcriptional elongation-facilitating actions of BRD4 in control of post-transcriptional RNA processing in innate signaling.",

    "abstract": "In the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), astrocytes are indispensable for brain development, function, and health. However, non-invasive tools to study astrocyte biology and function in vivo have been limited to genetically modified mice. CRISPR/Cas9-based genome engineering enables rapid and precise gene manipulations in the CNS. Here, we developed a non-invasive astrocyte-specific method utilizing a single AAV vector, GEARBOCS (Gene Editing in AstRocytes Based On CRISPR/Cas9 System). We verified GEARBOCS specificity to mouse cortical astrocytes and demonstrated its utility for three types of gene manipulations: knockout (KO); tagging (TagIN); and reporter gene knock-in (Gene-TRAP) strategies. We deployed GEARBOCS to determine whether cortical astrocytes express Vamp2 protein. The presence of Vamp2-positive vesicles in cultured astrocytes is well-established, however, Vamp2 protein expression in astrocytes in vivo has proven difficult to ascertain due to its overwhelming abundance in neurons. Using GEARBOCS, we delineated the in vivo astrocytic Vamp2 expression and found that it is required for maintaining excitatory and inhibitory synapse numbers in the visual cortex. GEARBOCS strategy provides fast and efficient means to study astrocyte biology in vivo.\n\nGraphical Abstract (Main Points)* GEARBOCS is a single AAV-based CRISPR tool to target mouse astrocytes in vivo.\n* GEARBOCS can be used to knockout, tag, or gene-trap genes of interest in astrocytes in vivo.\n* Using GEARBOCS, we confirmed astrocytes express Vamp2 and found that astrocytic Vamp2 is required for maintenance of excitatory and inhibitory synapse numbers in vivo.\n\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=93 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/524433v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ae7456org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@57f155org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a508c1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e1c0fa_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI)-induced tissue damage spreads to neighboring spared cells in the hours, days and weeks following injury leading to exacerbation of tissue damage and functional deficits. Among the biochemical changes is the rapid reduction of cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), an essential coenzyme for energy metabolism and an essential cofactor for non-redox NAD+-dependent enzymes with critical functions in sensing and repairing damaged tissue. NAD+ depletion propagates tissue damage. Augmenting NAD+ by exogenous application of NAD+, its synthesizing enzymes or its cellular precursors mitigates tissue damage. Among the NAD+ precursors, nicotinamide riboside (NR) appears to be particularly well-suited for clinical translation. It safely and effectively augments cellular NAD+ synthesis in a variety of species, including rats and humans, and in a variety of preclinical models, elicits tissue protection. Evidence of NRs efficacy in the context of SCI repair, however, is currently lacking. These studies tested the hypothesis that administration of NR can effectively enhance NAD+ in the injured spinal cord and that augmenting spinal cord NAD+ protects spinal cord tissue from injury and leads to improvements in locomotor recovery. The results show that intraperitoneal administration of NR (500 mg/kg), administered four days prior to and two weeks following a mid-thoracic contusion-SCI injury, doubles spinal cord NAD+ levels in Long-Evans rats. NR administration preserves spinal cord tissue after injury including neurons and axons, as determined by gray and white matter sparing, and enhances motor function, as assessed by the BBB subscore and missteps on the horizontal ladderwalk. Collectively, the findings demonstrate that administration of the NAD+ precursor, NR, to elevate NAD+ within the injured spinal cord mitigates the tissue damage and functional decline that occurs following SCI.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LINicotinamide Riboside augments spinal cord nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+).\nC_LIO_LIElevating NAD+ protects spinal cord tissue from spinal cord injury (SCI).\nC_LIO_LIElevating NAD+ enhances motor recovery following SCI.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "A defining feature of the cortex is its laminar organization, which is likely critical for cortical information processing. For example, visual stimuli of different size evoke distinct patterns of laminar activity. Visual information processing is also influenced by the response variability of individual neurons and the degree to which this variability is correlated among neurons. To elucidate laminar processing, we studied how neural response variability across the layers of macaque primary visual cortex is modulated by visual stimulus size. Our laminar recordings revealed that single neuron response variability and the shared variability among neurons are tuned for stimulus size, and this size-tuning is layer-dependent. In all layers, stimulation of the receptive field (RF) reduced single neuron variability, and the shared variability among neurons, relative to their pre-stimulus values. As the stimulus was enlarged beyond the RF, both single neuron and shared variability increased in supragranular layers, but either did not change or decreased in other layers. Surprisingly, we also found that small visual stimuli could increase variability relative to baseline values. Our results suggest multiple circuits and mechanisms as the source of variability in different layers and call for the development of new models of neural response variability.",

    "abstract": "Neuromedin U (NMU) is an evolutionary conserved neuropeptide that has been implicated in multiple processes, such as circadian regulation, energy homeostasis, reward processing and stress coping. Although central expression of NMU has been addressed previously, the lack of specific and sensitive tools has prevented a comprehensive characterization of NMU-expressing neurons in the brain. We have generated a knock-in mouse model constitutively expressing Cre recombinase under the Nmu promoter. We have validated the model using a multi-level approach based on quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions, in situ hybridization, a reporter mouse line and an adenoviral vector driving Cre-dependent expression of a fluorescent protein. Using the Nmu-Cre mouse, we performed a complete mapping of NMU expression in adult mouse brain, unveiling a potential midline NMU modulatory circuit with the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) as a key node. Moreover, immunohistochemical analysis suggested that NMU neurons in the VMH mainly constitute a unique population of hypothalamic cells. Taken together, our results suggest that Cre expression in the Nmu-Cre mouse model largely reflects NMU expression in the adult mouse brain, without altering endogenous NMU expression. Thus, the Nmu-Cre mouse model is a powerful and sensitive tool to explore the role of NMU neurons in mice.",

    "abstract": "Sterile alpha motif domain-containing proteins 9 and 9L (SAMD9/9L) are associated with life-threatening genetic diseases and are restriction factors of poxviruses. Yet, their cellular function and the extent of their antiviral role are poorly known. Here, we found that interferon-stimulated SAMD9L, and not SAMD9, restricts HIV-1 replication at the translation step, with a strong inhibition of Transmitted/Founder HIV-1 patient strains. More broadly, SAMD9L restricts primate lentiviruses, but not another retrovirus (MLV) or two ssRNA viruses (MOPV, VSV). Using structural modeling and mutagenesis of SAMD9L, we identified a Schlafen(SLFN)-like active site necessary for HIV-1 restriction. By testing a germline gain-of-function variant from patients with SAMD9L-associated autoinflammatory disease (SAAD) and ataxia-pancytopenia (ATXPC), we determined that SAMD9L cellular and pathogenic functions also depend on the SLFN-like active site. Finally, we propose a model in which SAMD9L translational repression could be dependent on codon-usage, linking its cellular function and the virus-specific innate immunity. The identification of another Achilles heel of HIV, as well as the inflammatory SAMD9L effector and auto-regulatory determinants, provide novel avenues against infectious and genetic diseases.\n\nSignificance statementThis study identifies SAMD9L as a potent HIV-1 antiviral factor from the interferon immunity and deciphers the host determinants underlying SAMD9L translational repression. The characterization of SAMD9L activity and determinants is also of medical importance for patients with rare genetic diseases bearing deleterious mutations in SAMD9L or with specific cancers. We demonstrate that a pathogenic SAMD9L patients variant is inactivated by the mutation of an identified active site in a SLFN-like box, resulting in an abolished translational shutdown. Furthermore, we describe SAMD9L, but not SAMD9, as an antiviral factor of HIV and lentiviruses, through a translational repression mediated by the SLFN-like box and potentially dependent on codon usage. These findings may have implications to better fight against HIV/AIDS as well as SAAD/ATXPC.\n\nKey findings- SAMD9L, but not SAMD9, restricts HIV-1, including Transmitted/Founder patient strains.\n- SAMD9L broadly restricts primate lentiviruses, but not the retrovirus MLV, nor two ssRNA viruses, the Rhabdovirus VSV and the Arenavirus MOPV.\n- SAMD9L inhibits viral and cellular translation through an essential E198/D243 active site in a SLFN-like box.\n- The SAMD9L-associated autoinflammatory disease (SAAD) F886Lfs*11 variant has enhanced HIV translational repression, unveiling an autoregulatory domain of the anti-lentiviral function.",

Two mAbs recognized linear epitopes in the C-terminal linker with sequence similarity to repeat and junction motifs, whereas all others targeted conformational epitopes in the -thrombospondin repeat (-TSR) domain. Specificity for the polymorphic Th2R/Th3R but not the conserved RII+ region in the -TSR was associated with IGHV3-21/IGVL3-21 or IGLV3-1 gene usage. Although the C terminus specific mAbs showed signs of more efficient affinity maturation and class-switching compared to anti-repeat mAbs, parasite inhibitory activity was limited to a single C-linker reactive mAb with cross-reactivity to the central repeat and junction. The data provide novel insights in the human anti-C-linker and anti--TSR antibody response that support exclusion of the PfCSP C terminus from malaria vaccine designs.",

There is no established clinical method to measure fibroblast activation during inflammation and their phenotypic dynamics upon therapy to date. Here we show that upon treatment with IL-17A/TNF-blocking antibodies fibroblasts change their phenotype from a destructive IL-6+/MMP3+THY1+ to a CD200+DKK3+ subtype, actively inducing resolution of inflammation. This phenotypic switch can be visualized due to so far unexplored different capacities of fibroblast subtypes with regard to receptor internalization of small molecular tracers with high affinity to FAP. Although FAP expression levels are comparable between fibroblast subtypes in the joint, FAP internalisation rate correlates with the destructive potential of fibroblasts and resolving fibroblasts have a lower FAP internalisation rate, providing a valuable imaging tool to visualize the transition from joint damage to resolution of inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Shrubs are used for revegetation of degraded dryland ecosystem worldwide and could recruit large numbers of microbes from the soil; however, the plant-associated microbiome assembly and the effect of plant introduction on the soil microbiomes are not fully understood. We detected shrub-associated microbes from five ecological microhabitats, including the leaves, litter, roots, rhizosphere, and root zone, across four xeric shrub plantations (Artemisia ordosica, Caragana korshinskii, Hedysarum mongolicum, and Salix psammophila). To detect the patterns of shrub-associated microbiome assembly, 16S and ITS2 rRNA gene sequencing was performed. PERMANOVA and differential abundance analysis demonstrated that changes in the bacterial and fungal communities were more dependent on the microhabitats rather than on the plant species, with distinct niche differentiation. Moreover, source tracking and nestedness analysis showed that shrub-associated bacteria were primarily derived from bulk soils and slightly pruned in different microhabitats; however, a similar pattern was not found for fungi. Furthermore, the surrounding zone of roots was a hotpot for microbial recruitments of revegetated shrubs. Null model analysis indicated that homogeneous selection of determinism dominated the bacterial communities, whereas dispersal limitation and undominated process of stochasticity drove the assembly of fungal communities. Our findings indicate that ecological microhabitat of revegetated shrublands was the main predictor of the bacterial and fungal compositional variances. This study will help advance our understanding of the mechanism underlying the plant-soil microbiome feedbacks during the initial plant-establishment period in a dryland ecosystem. Further, this work provides theoretical reference for establishment and sustainable management of shrublands in drylands.",

Due to inherent complexity and limited technical accessibility of the mitochondrial transcriptome, fundamental questions regarding mitochondrial gene expression and splicing remain unresolved, even in the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Long-read sequencing could address these fundamental questions. Therefore, a method for enrichment of mitochondrial RNA and sequencing using Nanopore technology was developed, enabling the resolution of splicing of polycistronic genes and the quantification the spliced RNA.\n\nThis method successfully captured the full mitochondrial transcriptome and resolved RNA splicing patterns with single-base resolution, and was applied to explore the transcriptome of S. cerevisiae grown with glucose or ethanol as sole carbon source, revealing the impact of growth conditions on mitochondrial RNA-expression and splicing. This study uncovered a remarkable difference in turn-over of group II introns between yeast grown in mostly fermentative and fully respiratory conditions. Whether this accumulation of introns in glucose medium has an impact on mitochondrial functions remains to be explored. Combined with the high tractability of the model yeast S. cerevisiae, the developed method enables to explore mitochondrial transcriptome regulation and processing in a broad range of conditions relevant in human context, including aging, apoptosis and mitochondrial diseases.",

Ifi207 has a large, distinctive repeat region that differs in sequence and length in different Mus strains. We show that IFI207 plays a key role in the STING-mediated response to cGAMP, DNA, and MLV, and that IFI207 controls MLV infection in vivo. Uniquely, IFI207 acts by stabilizing STING protein via its repeat region.

However, current near full-length (NFL) HIV-1 proviral genome sequencing assays are based on labor-intensive and costly principles of repeated PCRs at limiting dilution, restricting their scalability. To address this, we developed a high-throughput, long-read sequencing assay called HIV-PULSE (HIV Proviral UMI-mediated Long-read Sequencing). This assay uses unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to tag individual HIV-1 genomes, allowing for the omission of the limiting dilution step and enabling long-range PCR amplification of many NFL genomes in a single PCR reaction, while simultaneously overcoming poor single-read accuracy. We optimized the assay using HIV-infected cell lines and then applied it to blood samples from 18 individuals living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy, yielding a total of 1,308 distinct HIV-1 genomes. Benchmarking against the widely applied Full-Length Individual Proviral Sequencing assay revealed similar sensitivity (11% vs 18%) and overall good concordance, though at a significantly higher throughput. In conclusion, HIV-PULSE is a cost-efficient and scalable assay that allows for the characterization of the HIV-1 proviral landscape, making it an attractive method to study the HIV-1 reservoir composition and dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Life on Earth has evolved in a form suitable for the gravitational force of 1 x g. Although the pivotal role of gravity in gene expression has been revealed by multiomics approaches in space-flown samples and astronauts, the molecular details of how mammalian cells harness gravity have remained unclear. Here, we show that mitochondria utilize gravity to activate protein synthesis within the organelle. Genome-wide ribosome profiling unveiled reduced mitochondrial translation in mammalian cells and Caenorhabditis elegans under microgravity in the International Space Station and under simulated microgravity in the 3D-clinostat on the ground. In addition, we found that cell adhesion through laminin-integrin interaction, which is attenuated by microgravity, and the downstream FAK, RAC1, PAK1, BAD, and Bcl-2 family proteins relay the signals for mitochondrial protein synthesis. Consistent with the role of integrin as a mechanosensor, we observed the decrease in mitochondrial translation by minimization of mechanical stress in mouse skeletal muscle. Our work provides mechanistic insights into how cells convert gravitational and mechanical forces into translation in an energy-producing organelle.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas13 systems are unique among Class II CRISPR systems, as they exclusively target RNA. In vitro and in prokaryotic cells, Cas13 cleaves both target and non-target RNA indiscriminately upon activation by a specific target RNA. This property has been exploited for development of diagnostic nucleic acid detection tools. In eukaryotic cells, CRISPR-Cas13 initially seemed to exclusively cleave the target RNA and consequently, CRISPR-Cas13 has been adopted as a specific RNA knockdown tool. Recently, several groups have reported unexpected toxicity or collateral cleavage when using CRISPR-Cas13 in eukaryotic cells, which seems difficult to reconcile with the reported target specificity. To understand these seemingly contradicting findings, we explored the collateral cleavage activity of six Cas13 systems, and show that only the most active ortholog in vitro, LbuCas13a, exhibits strong collateral RNA cleavage activity in human cells. LbuCas13a displayed collateral cleavage in all tested cell lines, targeting both exogenous and endogenous transcripts and using different RNP delivery methods. Using Nanopore sequencing, we found that cytoplasmic RNAs are cleaved without bias by LbuCas13a. Furthermore, the cleavage sites are highly specific and often present in Uracil containing single stranded RNA loops of stem-loop structures. In response to collateral RNA cleavage, cells upregulate stress and innate immune response genes and depending on target transcript levels, RNA degradation resulted in apoptotic cell death. We demonstrate that LbuCas13a can serve as a cell selection tool, killing cells in a target RNA specific manner. As such, CRISPR-Cas13 is a promising new technology that might be useful in anti-tumor applications.",

    "abstract": "Species distribution models (SDM) are widely used to describe and explain how species relate to their environment, and predict their spatial distributions. As such, they are the cornerstone of most of spatial planning efforts worldwide. SDM can be implemented with wide array of data types (presence-only, presence-absence, count...), which can either be point- or areal-based, and use a wide array of environmental conditions as predictor variables. The choice of the sampling type as well as the resolution of environmental conditions to be used are recognized as of crucial importance, yet we lack any quantification of the effects these decisions may have on SDM reliability. In the present work, we fill this gap with an unprecedented simulation procedure. We simulated 100 possible distributions of two different virtual species in two different regions. Species distribution were modelled using either segment- or areal-based sampling and five different spatial resolutions of environmental conditions. The SDM performances were inspected by statistical metrics, model composition, shapes of relationships and prediction quality. We provided clear evidence of stochasticity in the modelling process (particularly in the shapes of relationships): two dataset from the same survey, species and region could yield different results. Sampling type had stronger effects than spatial resolution on the final model relevance. The effect of coarsening the resolution was directly related to the resistance of the spatial features to changes of scale: SDM failed to adequately identify spatial distributions when the spatial features targeted by the species were diluted by resolution coarsening. These results have important implications for the SDM community, backing up some commonly accepted choices, but also by highlighting some up-to-now unexpected features of SDM (stochasticity). As a whole, this work calls for carefully weighted decisions in implementing models, and for caution in interpreting results.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=182 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/524386v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (51K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@284632org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@189551org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f30b5aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16e67a3_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The Turkana people inhabit arid regions of east Africa--where temperatures are high and water is scarce--and they practice subsistence pastoralism, such that their diet is primarily composed of animal products. Working with Turkana communities, we sequenced 367 genomes and identified 8 regions putatively involved in adaptation to water stress and pastoralism. One of these regions includes a putative enhancer for STC1--a kidney-expressed gene involved in the response to dehydration and the metabolism of purine-rich foods such as red meat. We show that STC1 is induced by antidiuretic hormone in humans, is associated with urea levels in the Turkana themselves, and is under strong selection in this population (s[~]0.041). This work highlights that partnerships with subsistence-level groups can lead to new models of human physiology with biomedical relevance.",

    "abstract": "Poxviruses are known to encode a set of proteins that form an entry-fusion complex (EFC) to mediate virus entry. However, the diversity, evolution, and origin of these EFC proteins remain poorly understood. Here we identify the EFC protein homologs in poxviruses and other giant viruses of phylum Nucleocytoviricota. The 11 EFC genes are present in almost all pox-viruses, with the two smallest, G3 and O3, absent in Entomopoxvirinae and basal lineages of Chordopoxvirinae. Five of the EFC genes are further grouped into two families, A16/G9/J5 and F9/L1, which are widely distributed across other major lineages of Nucleocytoviricota, including metagenome-assembled genomes, but are generally absent in viruses infecting algae or non-amoebozoan heterotrophic protists. The A16/G9/J5 and F9/L1 families co-occur, mostly as single copies, in 93% of the non-Poxviridae giant viruses that have at least one of them. Distribution and phylogenetic patterns suggest that both families originated in the ancestor of Nucleocytoviricota. In addition to the Poxviridae genes, homologs from each of the other Nucleo-cytoviricota families are largely clustered together, suggesting their ancient presence and vertical inheritance. Despite deep sequence divergences, we observed noticeable conservation of cysteine residues and predicted structures between EFC proteins of Poxviridae and other families. Overall, our study reveals widespread distribution of these EFC protein homologs beyond pox-viruses, implies the existence of a conserved membrane fusion mechanism, and sheds light on host range and ancient evolution of Nucleocytoviricota.\n\nImportanceFusion between virus and host membranes is critical for viruses to release genetic materials and to initiate infection. Whereas most viruses use a single protein for membrane fusion, poxviruses employ a multi-protein entry-fusion complex (EFC). We report that two major families of the EFC proteins are widely distributed within the virus phylum Nucleocytoviricota, which include poxviruses and other dsDNA \"giant viruses\" that infect animals, amoebozoans, algae, and various microbial eukaryotes. Each of these two protein families is structurally conserved, traces its origin to the root of Nucleocytoviricota, was passed down to the major subclades of Nucleocytoviricota, and is retained in most giant viruses known to infect animals and amoebozoans. The EFC proteins therefore represent a potential mechanism for virus entry in diverse giant viruses. We hypothesize that they may have facilitated the infection of an animal/amoebozoan-like host by the last Nucleocytoviricota common ancestor.",

    "abstract": "Canine parvovirus (CPV) is a small non-enveloped single-stranded DNA virus that causes serious diseases in dogs worldwide. The original strain of the virus (CPV-2) emerged in dogs during the late-1970s due to a host range switch of a virus similar to the feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) that infected another host. The virus that emerged in dogs had altered capsid receptor- and antibody-binding sites, with some changes affecting both functions. Further receptor and antibody binding changes arose when the virus became better adapted to dogs or to other hosts. Here, we use in vitro selection and deep sequencing to reveal how two antibodies with known interactions select for escape mutations in CPV. The antibodies bind two distinct epitopes, and one largely overlaps the host receptor binding site. We also engineered antibody variants with altered binding structures. Viruses were passaged with the wild type or mutated antibodies, and their genomes deep sequenced during the selective process. A small number of mutations were detected only within the capsid protein gene during the first few passages of selection, and most sites remained polymorphic or were slow to go to fixation. Mutations arose both within and outside the antibody binding footprints on the capsids, and all avoided the TfR-binding footprint. Many selected mutations matched those that have arisen in the natural evolution of the virus. The patterns observed reveal the mechanisms by which these variants have been selected in nature and provide a better understanding of the interactions between antibody and receptor selections.\n\nIMPORTANCEAntibodies protect animals against infection by many different viruses and other pathogens, and we are gaining new information about the epitopes that induce antibody responses against viruses and the structures of the bound antibodies. However, less is known about the processes of antibody selection and antigenic escape and the constraints that apply in this system. Here, we use an in vitro model system and deep genome sequencing to reveal the mutations that arise in the virus genome during selection by each of two monoclonal antibodies or their engineered variants. High-resolution structures of each of the Fab: capsid complexes revealed their binding interactions. The engineered forms of the wild-type antibodies or mutant forms allowed us to examine how changes in antibody structure influence the mutational selection patterns seen in the virus. The results shed light on the processes of antibody binding, neutralization escape, and receptor binding, and likely have parallels for many other viruses.",

We present a one-to-one comparison of GP (16S rRNA metabarcoding) and microeukaryotic (GME) (18S rRNA metabarcoding) community patterning among 12 species of lemurs. Lemurs were sampled from dry forests and rainforests of southeastern Madagascar and display a range of phylogenetic and ecological diversity. We found that while lemur GPs vary with host taxonomy, diet, and habitat, GMEs have no association with these factors. As a mechanism, we suggest purifying selection purges microbes with negative and commensal associations, while positive selection promotes the persistence of beneficial microbes. It is therefore likely that a greater proportion of GMEs comprise taxa with commensal, transient, and parasitic symbioses compared with GPs, many of which are mutualists. Our study reveals different microbial taxa are shaped by unique selective pressures.",

Transposition relies on several key protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, but little is known about the explicit sequence requirements governing efficient transposon DNA integration activity. Here, we exploit pooled library screening and high-throughput sequencing to reveal novel sequence determinants during transposition by the Type I-F Vibrio cholerae CAST system. On the donor DNA, large mutagenic libraries identified core binding sites recognized by the TnsB transposase, as well as an additional conserved region that encoded a consensus binding site for integration host factor (IHF). Remarkably, we found that VchCAST requires IHF for efficient transposition, thus revealing a novel cellular factor involved in CRISPR-associated transpososome assembly. On the target DNA, we uncovered preferred sequence motifs at the integration site that explained previously observed heterogeneity with single-base pair resolution. Finally, we exploited our library data to design modified transposon variants that enable in-frame protein tagging. Collectively, our results provide new clues about the assembly and architecture of the paired-end complex formed between TnsB and the transposon DNA, and inform the design of custom payload sequences for genome engineering applications of CAST systems.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies along with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping have identified hundreds of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their target genes in prostate cancer (PCa), yet functional characterization of these risk loci remains challenging. To screen for potential regulatory SNPs, we designed a CRISPRi library containing 9133 guide RNAs (gRNAs) to target 2,166 candidate SNP sites implicated in PCa and identified 117 SNPs that could regulate 90 genes for PCa cell growth advantage. Among these, rs60464856 was covered by multiple gRNAs significantly depleted in the screening (FDR<0.05). Pooled SNP association analysis in the PRACTICAL and FinnGen cohorts showed significantly higher PCa risk for the rs60464856 G allele (pvalue=1.2E-16 and 3.2E-7). Subsequent eQTL analysis revealed that the G allele is associated with increased RUVBL1 expression in multiple datasets. Further CRISPRi and xCas9 base editing proved the rs60464856 G allele leading to an elevated RUVBL1 expression. Furthermore, SILAC-based proteomic analysis demonstrated allelic binding of cohesin subunits at the rs60464856 region, where HiC dataset showed consistent chromatin interactions in prostate cell lines. RUVBL1 depletion inhibited PCa cell proliferation and tumor growth in xenograft mouse model. Gene set enrichment analysis suggested an association of RUVBL1 expression with cell-cycle-related pathways. An increased expression of RUVBL1 and activations of cell-cycle pathways were correlated with poor PCa survival in TCGA datasets. Together, our CRISPRi screening prioritized about one hundred regulatory SNPs essential for prostate cell proliferation. In combination with proteomics and functional studies, we characterized the mechanistic role of rs60464856 and RUVBL1 in PCa progression.",

It is abundantly expressed in cardiomyocytes (CMs) and has been described as a key regulator of CM performance due to its unique ability to interact with structural contractile proteins, regulators of cardiac Ca2+ cycling, and mitochondrial proteins. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating S100A1 protein levels is limited. We used the bioinformatics tool GPS-SUMO2.0 to identify a putative SUMO interacting motif (SIM) on S100A1. Consistently, a S100A1:SUMO interaction assay showed a Ca2+-dependent interaction of S100A1 with SUMO proteins. In neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM) and COS1 cells, S100A1 protein abundance increased in the presence of overexpressed SUMO1 without affecting the S100A1 mRNA transcript. We then generated S100A1 truncation mutants, where the SIM motif was removed by truncation or in which the core residues of the SIM motif (residues 77-79) were deleted or replaced by alanine. In COS1 cells and NRVM, overexpression of these S100A1 mutants led to elevated S100A1 mutant mRNA levels but failed to produce respective protein levels. Protein expression of these mutants could be rescued from degradation by addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. By using an information-driven approach to dock the three-dimensional structures of S100A1 and SUMO, we predict a novel interaction mode between the SIM in S100A1 and SUMO. This study shows an important role of SUMO:SIM-mediated protein:protein interaction in the regulation of post-translational protein stability, and provides mechanistic insights into the indispensability of the core SIM for S100A1 post-translational stability.",

    "abstract": "It is challenging to share and aggregate biomedical data distributed among multiple institutions or computing resources due to various concerns including data privacy, security, and confidentiality. The federated Learning (FL) schema can effectively enable multiple institutions jointly perform machine learning by training a robust model with local data to satisfy the requirement of user privacy protection as well as data security. However, conventional FL methods are exposed to the risk of gradient leakage and cannot be directly applied to genetic data since they cannot address the unique challenges of data imbalance typically seen in genomics. To provide secure and efficient disease prediction based on genetic data distributed across multiple parties, we propose an FL framework enhanced with differential privacy (FedDP) on trained model parameters. In FedDP, local models can be trained among multiple local-hold genetic data with efficient secure and privacy-preserving techniques. The key idea of FedDP is to deploy differential privacy on compressed intermediate gradients that are computed and transmitted by optimizers from local parties. In addition, the unique weighted minmax loss in FedDP is able to address the difficulties of prediction for highly imbalanced genetic datasets. Our experiments on multiple genetic datasets demonstrate that FedDP provides a powerful tool to implement and evaluate various strategies in support of privacy preservation and model performance guarantee to overcome data imbalance.",

In this work using cryo-electron microscopy, we show that yeast eIF4B binds to the 40S ribosomal subunit at the mRNA entry channel making contacts with ribosomal proteins uS10, uS3, and eS10 and ribosomal rRNA helix h16. The yeast eIF4B position on the 40S overlaps with the RRM domain of eIF3g indicating that the binding of eIF4B may trigger the relocation of the eIF3 b-g-i module to the subunit interface. The 40S head is in partially open conformation that may facilitate the release of eIF3j and hence aid mRNA recruitment and scanning. The structural analysis of yeast eIF4B-bound ribosomal complex provides insight into possible events during mRNA recruitment.",

It is thus possible to generate accurate models of the native states of hundreds of millions of proteins. An open question, however, concerns whether these advances can be translated to disordered proteins, which should be represented as structural ensembles because of their heterogeneous and dynamical nature. Here we show that the inter-residue distances predicted by AlphaFold for disordered proteins can be used to construct accurate structural ensembles. These results illustrate the application to disordered proteins of deep learning methods originally trained for predicting the structures of folded proteins.",

    "abstract": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are chemotherapy resistant sarcomas that are a leading cause of death in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Although NF1-related MPNSTs derive from neural crest cell origin, they also exhibit intratumoral heterogeneity. TP53 mutations are associated with significantly decreased survival in MPNSTs, however the mechanisms underlying TP53-mediated therapy responses are unclear in the context of NF1-deficiency. We evaluated the role of two commonly altered genes, MET and TP53, in kinome reprograming and cellular differentiation in preclinical MPNST mouse models. We previously showed that MET amplification occurs early in human MPNST progression and that Trp53 loss abrogated MET-addiction resulting in MET inhibitor resistance. Here we demonstrate a novel mechanism of therapy resistance whereby p53 alters MET stability, localization, and downstream signaling leading to kinome reprogramming and lineage plasticity. Trp53 loss also resulted in a shift from RAS/ERK to AKT signaling and enhanced sensitivity to MEK and mTOR inhibition. In response to MET, MEK and mTOR inhibition, we observed broad and heterogeneous activation of key differentiation genes in Trp53-deficient lines suggesting Trp53 loss also impacts lineage plasticity in MPNSTs. These results demonstrate the mechanisms by which p53 loss alters MET dependency and therapy resistance in MPNSTS through kinome reprogramming and phenotypic flexibility.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most common and lethal subtype of ovarian cancer with limited therapeutic options. In recent years, PARP inhibitors have demonstrated significant clinical benefits, especially in patients with BRCA1/2 mutations. However, acquired drug resistance and relapse is a major challenge. Therapies disrupting the spliceosome alter cancer transcriptomes and have shown potential to improve PARP inhibitor response. Indisulam (E7070) has been identified as a molecular glue that brings splicing factor RBM39 and DCAF15 E3 ubiquitin ligase in close proximity. Exposure to indisulam induces RBM39 proteasomal degradation through DCAF15-mediated polyubiquitination and subsequent RNA splicing defects. In this study, we demonstrate that loss of RBM39 induces splicing errors in DNA damage repair genes in ovarian cancer, leading to increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors such as olaparib. Indisulam synergized with olaparib in multiple in vitro models of ovarian cancer regardless of PARP inhibitor sensitivity and improved olaparib response in mice bearing PARP inhibitor-resistant tumors. DCAF15 expression, but not BRCA1/2 mutational status, was essential for the synergy between indisulam and olaparib, suggesting that the combination therapy may benefit patients irrespective of their BRCA1/2 status. These findings demonstrate that combining RBM39 degraders and PARP inhibitors is a promising therapeutic approach to improving PARP inhibitor response in ovarian HGSC.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=74 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/524417v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4cccd5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1be34aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e72b06org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b9c89d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG One Sentence SummaryWe identified a novel drug combination that may improve PARP inhibitor response and benefit a large group of ovarian cancer patients.",

To demonstrate the utility of A2Mcap for protease engineering we exemplify the directed activity and specificity evolution of six serine proteases. This resulted in a variant of Staphylococcus aureus serin-protease-like (Spl) protease SplB, an enzyme used for recombinant protein processing that no longer requires activation by N-terminal signal peptide removal. SCHEMA-based domain shuffling was used to map the specificity determining regions of Spl proteases leading to a chimeric scaffold that supports specificity switching via subdomain exchange. The ability of A2Mcap to overcome key challenges en route to tailor-made proteases suggests easier access to such reagents in the future.",

Previous research has focused on gene expression changes in individual brain regions, such as the hippocampus or cortex. Therefore, it is unclear how uniformly or heterogeneously sleep loss affects the brain. Here, we use spatial transcriptomics to define the impact of a brief period of sleep deprivation across the brain. We find that sleep deprivation induced pronounced differences in gene expression across the brain, with the greatest changes in the hippocampus, neocortex, hypothalamus, and thalamus. Both the differentially expressed genes and the direction of regulation differed markedly across regions. Importantly, we developed bioinformatic tools to register tissue sections and gene expression data into a common anatomical space, allowing a brain-wide comparison of gene expression patterns between samples. Our results suggest that distinct molecular mechanisms acting in discrete brain regions underlie the biological effects of sleep deprivation.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=75 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/524406v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@86d135org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1110670org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bdaddeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e1d268_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LISpatial transcriptomics using the Visium platform reveals the transcriptional signature across the brain, recapitulating the anatomy of the mouse brain\nC_LIO_LISleep deprivation induces transcriptomic changes unique to each brain region\nC_LIO_LIThe hippocampus is the brain region impacted the most by acute sleep deprivation, with most differentially regulated genes significantly downregulated\nC_LIO_LIThe neocortex exhibits layer-specific changes in gene expression, with most differentially regulated genes significantly upregulated\nC_LIO_LIRegistration of spatial transcriptomic data to a common anatomical reference space (Allen Common Coordinate Framework) allows statistical analysis of gene expression across regions of the brain and for multi-sample analysis\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Homeostatic trafficking to lymph nodes allows T cells to efficiently survey the host for cognate antigen. Non-mammalian jawed vertebrates lack lymph nodes but maintain similarly diverse T cell pools. Here, we exploit in vivo imaging of transparent zebrafish to investigate how T cells organize and survey for antigen in an animal devoid of lymph nodes. We find that naive-like T cells in zebrafish organize into a previously undescribed whole-body lymphoid network that supports streaming migration and coordinated trafficking through the host. This network has the cellular hallmarks of a mammalian lymph node, including naive T cells and CCR7-ligand expressing non-hematopoietic cells, and facilitates rapid collective migration. During infection, T cells transition to a random walk that supports antigen presenting cell interactions and subsequent activation. Our results reveal that T cells can toggle between collective migration and individual random walks to prioritize either large-scale trafficking or antigen search in situ. This novel lymphoid network thus facilitates whole-body T cell trafficking and antigen surveillance in the absence of a lymph node system.\n\nSignificance StatementIn mammals, lymph nodes play a critical role in the initiation of adaptive immune responses by providing a dedicated place for T cells to scan antigen-presenting cells. Birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish all maintain diverse repertoires of T cells but lack lymph nodes, raising questions about how adaptive immunity functions in lower jawed vertebrates. Here, we describe a novel network of lymphocytes in zebrafish that supports whole-body T cell trafficking and provides a site for antigen search, mirroring the function of mammalian lymph nodes. Within this network, T cells can prioritize large-scale trafficking or antigen scanning by toggling between two distinct modes of migration. This network provides valuable insights into the evolution of adaptive immunity.",

    "abstract": "The transcription of mammalian genomes has been shown to possess an intriguing complexity and numerous novel RNA molecules have been identified in the last 10-15 years. Viruses with large DNA genomes, especially herpesviruses, are also shown to generate many different RNA species and some of them may function as long non-coding RNAs. Viral genomes harbor several genes within close proximity to each other and can generate multigenic transcripts in addition to commonly observed antisense transcription. It is essential to study the biological roles of these transcripts aside from the protein-coding counterparts. A transcriptionally complex locus can be studied with a combination of methods. Generally, quantitative PCR assays are very commonly used for expression analyses of the transcripts of interest. Here an example from a gammaherpesvirus is discussed in more detail. A recently developed method, for the resolution of complicated transcriptomes for viral genomes, elucidated multiple antisense transcripts from ORF63-64 locus in murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68). In order to identify the roles of these new transcripts, quantitative PCR assays may not be enough alone and should be supported by alternative methods such as Northern blots. A more detailed transcriptional map of the locus of interest is useful to design experimental strategies and perform functional studies.",

    "abstract": "Animal migration is a major driver of infectious agent dispersal. Duck and seabirds migrations, for instance, play a key role in the spatial transmission dynamics and gene flows of avian influenza viruses (AIV), worldwide. On tropical islands, brown and lesser noddies (Anous stolidus and A. tenuirostris) may be important AIV hosts, but the lack of knowledge on their migratory behaviour limits our understanding of virus circulation in island networks. Here we show that high connectivity between islands generated by post-breeding behaviours could be a major driver in the spread and the maintenance of AIV among tropical islands. Tracking data highlight two types of behaviours during the non-breeding season: birds either staying in the vicinity of their breeding ground (on Bird Island, Seychelles), or moving to and roosting on other islands in the Indian Ocean. Differences in roosting places are detected between migrant birds, ranging from the Tanzanian coast to the Maldives archipelago and Tromelin Island. Epidemiological data further support that brown and lesser noddies are major hosts for AIV, although significant variation of seroprevalence between species suggest that other drivers are involved in virus infection and transmission dynamics.",

    "abstract": "The horizontal transfer of genes is fundamental for the eco-evolutionary dynamics of microbial communities, such as oceanic plankton, soil, and the human microbiome. In the case of an acquired beneficial gene, classic population genetics would predict a genome-wide selective sweep, whereby the genome spreads clonally with the gene, removing genome diversity. Instead, several sources of metagenomic data show the existence of \"gene-specific sweeps\", whereby a beneficial gene spreads across a bacterial community, maintaining genome diversity. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this process, including the decreasing gene flow between ecologically distant populations, frequency-dependent selection from linked deleterious allelles, and very high rates of horizontal gene transfer. Here, we propose an additional possible scenario grounded in eco-evolutionary principles. Specifically, we show by a mathematical model and simulations that a metacommunity where species can occupy multiple patches helps maintain genome diversity. Assuming a scenario of patches dominated by single species, our model predicts that diversity only decreases moderately upon the arrival of a new beneficial gene, and that losses in diversity can be quickly restored. We explore the generic behavior of diversity as a function of three key parameters, frequency of insertion of new beneficial genes, migration rates and horizontal transfer rates.Our results provides a testable explanation for how diversity can be maintained given gene-specific sweeps even in the absence of high horizontal gene transfer rates.",

    "abstract": "This study examined if occluded joint locations from markerless motion capture produced 2D joint angles with reduced accuracy compared to visible joints, and if 2D frontal plane joint angles were usable for practical applications. Fifteen healthy participants performed over-ground walking whilst recorded by fifteen marker-based cameras and two machine vision cameras (frontal and sagittal plane). Repeated measures Bland-Altman analysis illustrated that markerless standard deviation of bias (random differences) for the occluded-side hip and knee joint angles in the sagittal plane were double that of the camera-side (visible) hip and knee. Camera-side sagittal plane knee and hip angles were near or within marker-based error values previously observed. While frontal plane random differences accounted for 35-46% of total range of motion at the hip and knee, systematic and random differences (-4.6-1.6 {+/-} 3.7-4.2{degrees}) were actually similar to previously reported marker-based error values. This was not true for the ankle, where random difference ({+/-}12{degrees}) was still too high for practical applications. Our results add to previous literature, highlighting shortcomings of current pose estimation algorithms and labelled datasets. As such, this paper finishes by reviewing marker-based methods for creating anatomically accurate markerless training data.",

Cell tagging strategies with DNA barcodes have recently enabled analysis of clone size dynamics and clone-restricted transcriptomic landscapes of heterogeneous populations. However, isolating a target clone that displays a specific phenotype from a complex population remains challenging. Here, we present a new multi-kingdom genetic barcoding system, CloneSelect, in which a target cell clone can be triggered to express a reporter gene for isolation through barcode-specific CRISPR base editing. In CloneSelect, cells are first barcoded and propagated so their subpopulation can be subjected to a given experiment. A clone that shows a phenotype or genotype of interest at a given time can then be isolated from the initial or subsequent cell pools stored throughout the experimental timecourse. This novel CRISPR-barcode genetics platform provides many new ways of analyzing and manipulating mammalian, yeast, and bacterial systems.\n\nTeaserA multi-kingdom CRISPR-activatable barcoding system enables the precise isolation of target barcode-labeled clones from a complex cell population.",

While most predictive models have been formalized using explicit representations of the probability distributions, using explicit structures and parameters, we explore an alternative representation using an implicit model known as generative adversarial networks, which has been widely explored in recent days in machine learning studies as they can learn the distribution directly from data. We demonstrate how a generative adversarial network can be trained to learn an implicit generative model of motor dynamics applicable to motor control. Furthermore, we show that such a model can perform approximate inference using the trained model, providing the necessary computations for both the forward and inverse model of motor control. We suggest that the cortical-basal ganglia circuit may behave as the generator and discriminator in the generative adversarial network model.",

Cystine is used for protein synthesis and incorporation in thiol peptides such as glutathione, which function as cofactors for reactive oxygen species scavenging enzymes. Glutamate export by astrocytes through system Xc- has been implicated in excitotoxicity, a form of neurotoxicity that has been postulated to also occur in insulin-producing beta-cells in the pancreatic islets. This study describes the implications of Slc7a11 deficiency on glucose metabolism in both constitutive and myeloid cells-specific knockout mice. Constitutive Slc7a11 deficiency leads to drastically lowered glutathione levels in the pancreatic islets and immune cells in addition to diminished insulin secretion both in vitro and in vivo. Macrophage-specific deletion did not have a significant impact on metabolism or islet function. These findings suggest that system Xc- is required for glutathione maintenance and insulin production in beta-cells, but is dispensable for islet macrophage function.",

However, it remains unclear whether these cognitive functions also show competitive relationship with implicit statistical learning across individuals and at the level of latent executive function components. In order to address this currently unknown aspect, we investigated, in two independent experiments (NStudy1 = 186, NStudy2 = 157), the relationship between implicit statistical learning, measured by the Alternating Serial Reaction Time task, and executive functions, measured by multiple neuropsychological tests. In both studies, a modest, but consistent negative correlation between implicit statistical learning and most executive function measures was observed. Factor analysis further revealed that a factor representing the verbal fluency and complex working memory seemed to drive these negative correlations. Thus, an antagonism between implicit statistical learning and executive functions might specifically be mediated by updating component of executive functions or/and long-term memory access.",

We found that all languages elicit a response reliably above the perceptually matched control condition in all areas of the language network. The response magnitude across languages generally scaled with comprehension level: aside from the native language, which elicited a relatively low response, languages that were more comprehensible to the participant elicited stronger responses. This pattern held for both familiar (studied) languages, and unfamiliar languages (cognate languages of high-proficiency languages elicited a stronger response than non-cognate languages). We also replicated a prior finding of weaker responses during native language processing in polyglots compared to non-polyglots. These results contribute to our understanding of how multiple languages co-exist within a single brain and provide new evidence that the language-selective network responds more strongly to stimuli from which more linguistic meaning can be extracted.",

    "abstract": "Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a neurodegenerative syndrome characterized by progressive language deficits. There are three main variants of PPA - semantic (svPPA), logopenic (lvPPA), and nonfluent (nfvPPA) - that can be challenging to distinguish. Limb praxis may also be affected in PPA, but it is unclear whether different variants of PPA are associated with differences in gesture production. Prior research with neurotypical individuals indicates that the left temporal lobe is a critical locus of manipulable object and hand posture representations. Moreover, when imitating gestures, individuals whose strokes include the left temporal lobe show reduced benefit of gesture meaning and disproportionate impairment in hand posture as compared to arm kinematics. We tested the hypothesis that svPPA - who typically exhibit primarily temporal lobe atrophy - would differentially show these expected patterns of gesture imitation performance. Nineteen participants with PPA completed meaningful and meaningless gesture imitation tasks, and performance was scored for hand posture and arm kinematics accuracy. Generalized logistic mixed-effect regression models controlling for dementia severity showed overall benefits from gesture meaning, and greater impairments in hand posture than arm kinematics. We also found that svPPA participants were the most impaired in gesture imitation overall. Critically, there was also a significant three-way interaction of group, meaning, and gesture component: only svPPA participants showed relative impairments of hand posture for meaningful gestures as well as meaningless gestures. Thus, unlike lvPPA and nfvPPA, the hand postures of svPPA failed to benefit from gesture meaning. This research extends prior findings on the role of the temporal lobe in hand posture representations associated with manipulable objects, and is the first to indicate that there may be distinct gesture imitation patterns as a function of PPA variant. Characterizing componential gesture deficits in PPA may help to inform differential diagnosis, compensatory communication strategies, and cognitive praxis models of PPA.",

    "abstract": "Serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) play important roles early in postnatal development in the maturation and modulation of higher order emotional, sensory, and cognitive circuitry. This unique position makes these cells a substrate by which early experience can be wired into brain. In this study, we have investigated the maturation of synapses onto dorsal raphe serotonergic neurons in typically developing male and female mice using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in ex vivo brain slices. We show that while inhibition of these neurons is relatively stable across development, glutamatergic synapses greatly increase in strength between P6 and P21-23. In contrast to forebrain regions, where the components making up glutamatergic synapses are dynamic across early life, we find that the makeup of these synapses onto DRN serotonergic neurons is largely stable after P15. DRN excitatory synapses maintain a very high ratio of AMPA to NMDA receptors and a rectifying component of the AMPA response throughout the lifespan. Overall, these findings reveal that the development of serotonergic neurons is marked by a significant refinement of glutamatergic synapses during the first 3 postnatal weeks. This suggests this time as a sensitive period of heightened plasticity for integration of information from upstream brain areas and that genetic and environmental insults during this period could lead to alterations in serotonergic output, impacting both the development of forebrain circuits and lifelong neuromodulatory actions.",

Processing of face information in the subcortical pathway is inaccurate, but the architectural and physiological properties that are responsible remain unclear. We analyzed the performance of convolutional neural networks incorporating three prominent properties of this pathway: a shallow layer architecture, concentric receptive fields at the first processing stage, and a greater degree of spatial pooling. The neural networks designed in this way could be trained to classify seven facial expressions with a correct rate of 51% (chance level, 14%). This modest performance was gradually improved by replacing the three properties, one-by-one, two at a time, or all three simultaneously, with the corresponding features in the cortical pathway. Some processing units in the final layer were sensitive to spatial frequencies (SFs) in the retina-based coordinate, whereas others were sensitive to object-based SFs, similar to neurons in the amygdala. Replacement of any one of these properties affected the SF coordinate of units. All three properties constrain the accuracy of facial expression information in the subcortical pathway, and are essential for determining the coordinate of SF representation.",

Deletion of {beta}- and{gamma} -catenin from MN progenitors results in perinatal lethality and a severe reduction in phrenic MN bursting activity. In the absence of catenin signaling, phrenic MN topography is eroded, MN clustering is lost and phrenic axons and dendrites fail to grow appropriately. Despite the essential requirement for catenins in early phrenic MN development, they appear to be dispensable for phrenic MN maintenance, as catenin deletion from postmitotic MNs does not impact phrenic MN topography or function.
