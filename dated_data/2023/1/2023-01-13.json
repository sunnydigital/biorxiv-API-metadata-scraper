    "abstract": "Loss of Lon1 in plant mitochondria led to stunted plant growth and accumulation of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins, including Lon1 substrates, while mitochondrial-encoded proteins typically decreased in abundance. Lon1 mutants contained protein aggregates in the mitochondria matrix which were enriched in PPR-containing proteins and ribosomal subunits of the translation apparatus and were slowed in mitochondrial RNA splicing, editing and general translation rate. Transcriptome analysis showed multiple organellar unfolded protein responses involving ethylene biosynthesis were induced by either Lon1 loss, mitochondrial ribosomal protein loss, translation or respiratory inhibition and most were regulated by the mitochondrial retrograde signaling pathway dependent on the transcription factor NAC017. The short hypocotyl in lon1 mutants during skotomorphogenesis was partially rescued by ethylene inhibitors and mutants showed higher ethylene production rates than wildtype. Together this provides multiple steps in the link between loss of Lon1 and its whole plant phenotype.\n\nSingle Sentence SummaryLon1 knockout inhibits mitochondrial-encoded gene translation and induces retrograde signaling involving unfolded protein responses.",

    "abstract": "PurposeTo develop a new method for high-fidelity, high-resolution 3D multi-slab diffusion MRI with minimal distortion and boundary slice aliasing.\n\nMethodsOur method modifies 3D multi-slab imaging to integrate blip-reversed acquisitions for distortion correction and oversampling in the slice direction (kz) for reducing boundary slice aliasing. Our aim is to achieve robust acceleration to keep the scan time the same as conventional 3D multi-slab acquisitions, in which data are acquired with a single direction of blip traversal and without kz-oversampling. We employ a two-stage reconstruction. In the first stage, the blip-up/down images are respectively reconstructed and analyzed to produce a field map for each diffusion direction. In the second stage, the blip-reversed data and the field map are incorporated into a joint reconstruction to produce images that are corrected for distortion and boundary slice aliasing.\n\nResultsWe conducted experiments at 7T in six healthy subjects. Stage 1 reconstruction produces images from highly under-sampled data (R=7.2) with sufficient quality to provide accurate field map estimation. Stage 2 joint reconstruction substantially reduces distortion artifacts with comparable quality to fully-sampled blip-reversed results (2.4x scan time). Whole-brain in-vivo results acquired at 1.05mm isotropic resolution demonstrate improved anatomical fidelity compared to conventional 3D multi-slab imaging. Data demonstrate good reliability and reproducibility of the proposed method over multiple subjects.\n\nConclusionThe proposed acquisition and reconstruction framework provide major reductions in distortion and boundary slice aliasing for 3D multi-slab diffusion MRI without increasing the scan time. This method has the potential to provide high-quality, high-resolution diffusion MRI.",

    "abstract": "Perception is shaped by past experience, both cumulative and contextual. Serial dependence reflects a contextual attractive bias to perceive or report the world as more stable than it truly is. As serial dependence has often been examined in continuous report or change detection tasks, it unclear whether attraction is towards the identity of the previous stimulus feature, or rather to the response made to indicate the perceived stimulus value on the previous trial. The physical and reported identities can be highly correlated depending on properties of the stimulus and task design. However, they are distinct values and dissociating them is important because it can reveal information about the role of sensory and non-sensory contributions to attractive biases. These alternative possibilities can be challenging to disentangle because 1) stimulus values and responses are typically strongly correlated and 2) measuring response biases using standard techniques can be confounded by context-independent biases such as cardinal bias for orientation (i.e., higher precision, but repelled, responses from vertical and horizontal orientations). Here we explore the issues and confounds related to measuring response biases using simulations. Under a range of conditions, we find that response-induced biases can be reliably distinguished from stimulus-induced biases and from confounds introduced by context-independent biases. We then applied these approaches to a delayed report dataset (N=18) and found evidence for response over a stimulus driven history bias. This work demonstrates that stimulus and response driven history biases can be reliably dissociated and provides code to implement these analysis procedures.",

    "abstract": "The human brain shows higher variability in functional connectivity in the heteromodal association cortex but lower variability in the unimodal cortex. As the anatomical substrate of functional connectivity, the temporal-spatial pattern of individual variability in structural connectivity remains largely unknown. In the present study, we depicted the temporal-spatial pattern of individual variability in structural connectivity, which is highest in the limbic regions and lowest in the unimodal sensorimotor regions. With increasing age, the variability in structural connectivity increased. Our results demonstrated that this specific spatial distribution relates to the plasticity of synapses and white matter. We proposed a modified ridge regression model to predict cognition individually and generate idiographic brain mapping. Individual variability in structural connectivity is significantly correlated with idiographic brain mapping. Overall, our study has potential implications for understanding biological and genetic mechanisms of variability in structural connectivity, guiding interventions to promote successful cognitive ageing and interpreting statistical maps in the human connectome.",

    "abstract": "Neurons in oscillatory networks often exhibit membrane potential resonance, a peak impedance at a non-zero input frequency. In electrically coupled oscillatory networks, the coupling coefficient (the ratio of post- and prejunctional voltage responses) could also show resonance. Such coupling resonance may emerge from the interaction between the coupling current and resonance properties of the coupled neurons, but this relationship has not been clearly described. Additionally, it is unknown if the gap-junction mediated electrical coupling conductance may have frequency dependence. We examined these questions by recording a pair of electrically coupled neurons in the oscillatory pyloric network of the crab Cancer borealis. We performed dual current- and voltage-clamp recordings and quantified the frequency preference of the coupled neurons, the coupling coefficient, the electrical conductance, and the postjunctional neuronal response. We found that all components exhibit frequency selectivity, but with distinct preferred frequencies. Mathematical and computational analysis showed that membrane potential resonance of the postjunctional neuron was sufficient to give rise to resonance properties of the coupling coefficient, but not the coupling conductance. A distinct coupling conductance resonance frequency therefore emerges either from other circuit components or from the gating properties of the gap junctions. Finally, to explore the functional effect of the resonance of the coupling conductance, we examined its role in synchronizing neuronal the activities of electrically coupled bursting model neurons. Together, our findings elucidate factors that produce electrical coupling resonance and the function of this resonance in oscillatory networks.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegeneration measured through volumetry in MRI is recognized as a potential Alzheimers Disease (AD) biomarker, but its utility is limited by lack of specificity. Quantifying spatial patterns of neurodegeneration on a whole brain scale rather than locally may help address this. In this work, we turn to network based analyses and extend a graph embedding algorithm to study morphometric connectivity from volume-change correlations measured with structural MRI on the timescale of years. We model our data with the multiple random eigengraphs framework, as well as modify and implement a multigraph embedding algorithm proposed earlier to estimate a low dimensional embedding of the networks. Our version of the algorithm guarantees meaningful finite-sample results and estimates maximum likelihood edge probabilities from population-specific network modes and subject-specific loadings. Furthermore, we propose and implement a novel statistical testing procedure to analyze group differences after accounting for confounders and locate significant structures during AD neurodegeneration. Family-wise error rate is controlled at 5% using permutation testing on the maximum statistic. We show that results from our analysis reveal networks dominated by known structures associated to AD neurodegeneration, indicating the framework has promise for studying AD. Furthermore, we find network-structure tuples that are not found with traditional methods in the field.",

    "abstract": "Social touch, an important aspect of social interaction and communication, is essential to kinship across animal species. How animals experience and respond to social touch has not been thoroughly investigated, in part due to the lack of appropriate assays. Previous studies that examined social touch in freely moving rodents lacked the necessary temporal and spatial control over individual touch interactions. We designed a novel head-fixed assay for social touch in mice, in which the experimenter has complete control to elicit highly stereotyped bouts of social touch between two animals. The user determines the number, duration, context, and type of social touch interactions, while monitoring with high frame rate cameras an array of complex behavioral responses. We focused on social touch to the face because of their high translational relevance to humans. We validated this assay in two different models of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the Fmr1 knockout model of Fragile X Syndrome and maternal immune activation mice. We observed increased avoidance, hyperarousal, and more aversive facial expressions to social touch, but not to object touch, in both ASD models compared to controls. Because this new social touch assay for head-fixed mice can be used to record neural activity during repeated bouts of social touch it should be of interest to neuroscientists interested in uncovering the underlying circuits.",

Glymphatic dysfunction has been associated with several neurological diseases such as Alzheimers disease, traumatic brain injury, and stroke. Therefore, it may be an important target for therapeutic interventions. In this study, we demonstrated that very low intensity ultrasound (VLIUS) (center frequency = 1 MHz; pulse repetition frequency = 1 kHz; duty factor = 1%, and spatial peak temporal average intensity [Ispta] = 3.68 mW/cm2; duration = 5 min) could significantly enhance the influx of cerebrospinal fluid tracers into the perivascular spaces of the brain and also facilitate interstitial substance clearance from the brain parenchyma. Notably, no evidence of brain damage was observed after VLIUS stimulation. We also demonstrated that VLIUS enhanced the glymphatic influx via the transient receptor potential vanilloid-4-aquaporin-4 pathway in the astrocytes. This mechanism may provide insights into VLIUS-regulated glymphatic function that modifies the natural course of central nervous system disorders related to waste clearance dysfunction.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryVery low-intensity ultrasound enhances glymphatic influx via the TRPV4-AQP4 pathway in the astrocytes, without observable brain damage.",

    "abstract": "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been long considered a key player in cancer-associated cachexia1-15. It is believed that sustained elevation of IL-6 production during cancer progression causes brain dysfunctions, which ultimately result in cachexia16-20. However, how peripheral IL-6 influences the brain remains poorly understood. Here we show that neurons in the area postrema (AP), a circumventricular structure in the hindbrain, mediate the function of IL-6 in cancer-associated cachexia in mice. We found that circulating IL-6 can rapidly enter the AP and activate AP neurons. Peripheral tumor, known to increase circulating IL-61-5,15,18,21-23, leads to elevated IL-6 and neuronal hyperactivity in the AP, and causes potentiated excitatory synaptic transmission onto AP neurons. Remarkably, neutralization of IL-6 in the brain of tumor-bearing mice with an IL-6 antibody prevents cachexia, reduces the hyperactivity in an AP network, and markedly prolongs lifespan. Furthermore, suppression of Il6ra, the gene encoding IL-6 receptor, specifically in AP neurons with CRISPR/dCas9 interference achieves similar effects. Silencing of Gfral-expressing AP neurons also ameliorates the cancer-associated cachectic phenotypes and AP network hyperactivity. Our study identifies a central mechanism underlying the function of peripheral IL-6, which may serve as a target for treating cancer-associated cachexia.",

    "abstract": "Rhythmic breathing is generated by neural circuits located in the brainstem. At its core is the preBotzinger Complex (preBotC), a region of the medulla, necessary for the generation of rhythmic breathing in mammals. The preBotC is comprised of various neuronal populations expressing neurokinin-1 receptors, the cognate G-protein-coupled receptor of the neuropeptide substance P (encoded by the tachykinin precursor 1 or Tac1). Neurokinin-1 receptors are highly expressed in the preBotC and destruction or deletion of neurokinin-1 receptor-expressing preBotC neurons severely impairs rhythmic breathing. Application of substance P to the preBotC stimulates breathing in rodents, however substance P is often associated with nociception and locomotion in various brain regions, suggesting that Tac1 neurons found in the preBotC may have diverse functional roles. Here, we aim to characterize the role of Tac1-expressing preBotC neurons in the generation of rhythmic breathing in vivo, as well as motor behaviors. Using a cre-lox recombination approach, we injected adeno-associated virus containing the excitatory channelrhodopsin-2 ChETA in the preBotC region of Tac1-cre mice. Using a combination of histological, optogenetics, respiratory, and behavioral assays, we defined the identity and the role of Tac1 preBotC neurons. These neurons are glutamatergic and their stimulation promotes rhythmic breathing in both anesthetized and freely moving/awake animals, but also triggers locomotion and overcomes respiratory depression by opioid drugs. Overall, our study identifies a new population of excitatory preBotC with major role in rhythmic breathing and behaviors.",

    "abstract": "A prominent account of decision-making assumes that information is accumulated until a fixed response threshold is crossed. However, many decisions require weighting of information appropriately against time. Collapsing response thresholds are a mathematically optimal solution to this decision problem. However, our understanding of the neurocomputational mechanisms that underly dynamic response thresholds remains very incomplete. To investigate this issue, we used a multistage drift diffusion model (DDM) and also analysed EEG beta power lateralization (BPL). The latter served as a neural proxy for decision signals. We analysed a large dataset (n=863) from a speeded flanker task and data from an independent confirmation sample (n=119). We show that a DDM with collapsing decision thresholds, a process where the decision boundary reduces over time, captured participants time-dependent decision policy better than a model with fixed thresholds. Previous research suggests that BPL over motor cortices reflects features of a decision signal and that its peak may serve as a neural proxy for the decision threshold. Our findings offer compelling evidence for the existence of collapsing decision thresholds in decision-making processes.",

It is possible to study this activity in rodents using electrophysiology, but these experiments require great skill and can be prone to bias. Here, we have examined whether in vivo calcium imaging with GCaMP6s can be used as an alternative approach. We show that spontaneously active calcium transients can be visualised in the fourth lumbar dorsal root ganglion (L4 DRG) via in vivo imaging in a mouse model of pain. Application of lidocaine to the nerve, between the inflamed site and the DRG, silenced spontaneous firing and revealed the true baseline level of calcium for spontaneously active neurons. We used this data to train a machine leaning algorithm to predict when a neuron is spontaneously active. We show that our algorithm is accurate in two different models of pain: intraplantar Complete Freunds Adjuvant and antigen-induced arthritis, with accuracies of 90.0% +/-1.2 and 85.9 % +/-2.1, respectively, assessed against visual inspection by an experienced observer. The algorithm can also detect neuronal activity in imaging experiments generated in a different lab using a different microscope configuration (Accuracy = 94.0 % +/2.2).

One common form of such biases is repulsive bias, a tendency to sort an item into the class opposite to its preceding items. Sensory-adaptation and boundary-updating are considered as two contending sources of the repulsive bias, yet no neural support has been provided for either source. Here we explored human brains, using fMRI, to find such supports by relating the brain signals of sensory-adaptation and boundary-updating to human classification behavior. We found that the stimulus-encoding signal in the early visual cortex adapted to previous stimuli, yet its adaptation-related changes were dissociated from current choices. Contrastingly, the boundary-representing signals in the inferior-parietal and superior-temporal cortices shifted to previous stimuli and covaried with current choices. Our exploration points to boundary-updating, rather than sensory-adaptation, as the origin of the repulsive bias in binary classification.",

    "abstract": "How does the human brain combine information across the eyes? It has been known for many years that cortical normalisation mechanisms implement \"ocularity invariance\": equalising neural responses to spatial patterns presented either monocularly or binocularly. Here we used a novel combination of electrophysiology, psychophysics, pupillometry and computational modelling to ask whether this invariance also holds for flickering luminance stimuli with no spatial contrast. We find dramatic violations of ocularity invariance for these stimuli, both in cortex and also in the subcortical pathways that govern pupil diameter. Specifically, we find substantial binocular facilitation in both pathways with the effect being strongest in cortex. Near-linear binocular additivity (instead of ocularity invariance) was also found using a perceptual luminance matching task. Ocularity invariance is therefore not a ubiquitous feature of visual processing, and the brain appears to repurpose a generic normalisation algorithm for different visual functions by adjusting the amount of interocular suppression.",

    "abstract": "Dietary polyphenols and in particular bioavailable metabolites resulting from gut microbiota transformations appear to have beneficial effects in situations of impaired cognition, combatting memory deficits in acute pathological models of neurodegeneration. Modifications to blood flow may underlie the effects of these molecules and although some such metabolites cross the blood-brain barrier, their targets and electrophysiological effects remain unknown. Hence, we explored the systemic and direct effects of protochatechuic acid (PCA) on electrical activity in the hippocampus and cortex of anesthetized female rats, recording evoked and spontaneous high-density field potentials (FPs) to mathematically derive pathway-specific FP generators. We found transient and sustained effects of PCA on evoked activity in the CA1 field, including paradoxical actions on excitatory transmission that depend on the route of administration. Systemic delivery of PCA altered the ongoing activity of some FP generators, albeit with marked inter-animal variation. Interestingly, PCA induced the detachment of infraslow cortico-hippocampal activities over a scale of minutes. These results point to direct actions of polyphenols on cell and network electrical activity, some of which reflect non-specific actions. Thus, dietary-derived polyphenols appear to fulfill neuromodulatory roles, encouraging the search for additional targets to better guide their use in preventing brain pathologies.",

    "abstract": "Pupillary responses have now been reliably identified for cognitive and motor tasks, but less is known about their relation to mentally simulating movements (known as motor imagery). Previous work found pupil dilations during the performance of simple finger movements, where peak pupillary dilation scaled with the complexity of the finger movement and force required. Recently, pupillary dilations were reported during imagery of grasping and piano playing. Here we examined whether pupillary responses are sensitive to the dynamics of the underlying motor task for both executed and imagined reach movements. Participants reached or imagined reaching to one of three targets placed at different distances from a start position. Both executed and imagined movement times scaled with target distance, and they were highly correlated, confirming previous work and suggesting that participants did imagine the respective movement. Increased pupillary dilation was evident during motor execution compared to rest, with stronger dilations for larger movements. Pupil dilations also occurred during motor imagery, however they were generally weaker than during motor execution and they were not influenced by imagined movement distance. Instead, dilations during motor imagery resembled pupil responses obtained during a non-motor imagery task (imagining a previously viewed painting). Our results demonstrate that pupillary responses can reliably capture the dynamics of an executed goal-directed reaching movement, but suggest that pupillary responses during imagined reaching movements reflect general cognitive rather than motor-specific components of the motor imagery process.\n\nNew and noteworthyPupil size is influenced by the performance of cognitive tasks. Here we demonstrate that pupil size increases during execution and mental simulation of goal-directed reaching movements compared to rest. Pupil dilations scale with movement amplitude only during motor execution, whereas they are similar during motor imagery and a non-motor imagery, cognitive task.",

    "abstract": "Two decades after its introduction, optogenetics - a biological technique to control the activity of neurons or other cell types with light - remains a cutting edge and promising tool to study biological processes. Its increasing usage in research varies widely from causally exploring biological mechanisms and neural computations, to neurostimulation and sensory restauration. To stimulate neurons in the brain, a variety of approaches have been developed to generate precise spatiotemporal light patterns. Yet certain constrains still exists in the current optical techniques to activate a neuronal population with both cellular resolution and millisecond precision. Here, we describe an experimental setup allowing to stimulate a few tens of neurons in a plane at sub-millisecond rates using 2-photon activation. A liquid crystal on silicon spatial light modulator (LCoS-SLM) was used to generate spatial patterns in 2 dimensions. The image of the patterns was formed on the plane of a digital micromirror device (DMD) that was used as a fast temporal modulator of each region of interest. Using fluorescent microscopy and patch-clamp recording of neurons in culture expressing the light-gated ion channels, we characterized the temporal and spatial resolution of the microscope. We described the advantages of combining the LCoS-SLM with the DMD to maximize the temporal precision, modulate the illumination amplitude, and reduce background activation. Finally, we showed that this approach can be extended to patterns in 3 dimensions. We concluded that the methodology is well suited to address important questions about the role of temporal information in neuronal coding.",

    "abstract": "Retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is a cortical region that computes heading direction from landmark information, but how it does this remains unknown. Recently we found that its two major subregions receive differential projections from two anteroventral thalamic (AV) subfields; dorsomedial (AVDM) and ventrolateral (AVVL). To probe the respective contributions of these inputs we recorded single neurons and local field potentials from AV in rats during foraging. We observed and characterized neurons modulated by theta oscillations, heading direction, and a conjunction of these. Unexpectedly, we also discovered place cells (neurons modulated by location). Consistent with the notion that AV contains two parallel subcircuits, there was a prevalence of non-conjunctive cells in AVDM, and of conjunctive and place neurons in AVVL. This integration of spatial and movement signals in AV is consistent with a thalamic role in multimodal integration and may be important for supplying the spatial information that modulates RSC directional responding.",

    "abstract": "Droplet microfluidic methods have massively increased the throughput of single-cell sequencing campaigns. The benefit of scale-up is, however, accompanied by increased background noise when processing challenging samples and the overall RNA capture efficiency is lower. These drawbacks stem from the lack of strategies to enrich for high-quality material or specific cell types at the moment of cell encapsulation and the absence of implementable multi-step enzymatic processes that increase capture. Here we alleviate both bottlenecks using fluorescence-activated droplet sorting to enrich for droplets that contain single viable cells, intact nuclei, fixed cells or target cell types and use reagent addition to droplets by picoinjection to perform multi-step lysis and reverse transcription. Our methodology increases gene detection rates fivefold, while reducing background noise by up to half. We harness these unique properties to deliver a high-quality molecular atlas of mouse brain development, despite starting with highly damaged input material, and provide an atlas of nascent RNA transcription during mouse organogenesis. Our method is broadly applicable to other droplet-based workflows to deliver sensitive and accurate single-cell profiling at a reduced cost.",

    "abstract": "The Event-based Vision Sensor (EVS) is a bio-inspired sensor that captures detailed motions of objects, developed with the applicability to become the  eyes of machines and especially self-driving cars. Compared to conventional frame-based image sensors as employed in video cameras, EVS has an extremely fast motion capture equivalent to 10,000-fps even with standard optical settings and additionally has high dynamic ranges for brightness and also lower consumption of memory and energy. These features make the EVS an ideal method to tackle questions in biology, such as the fine-scale behavioural ecology. Here, we developed 22 characteristic features for analysing the motions of aquatic particles from the raw data of the EVS, and deployed the EVS system in both natural environments and laboratory aquariums to test its applicability to filming and analysing plankton behaviour. Our EVS monitoring in turbid water at the bottom of Lake Biwa, Japan identified several particles exhibiting distinct cumulative trajectory with periodicities in their motion (up to 16 Hz), suggesting that they were living organisms with rhythmic behaviour. We also carried out EVS monitoring in the deep sea aided by infrared lighting to minimise influence on behaviour, and observed particles with active motion and periodicities over 40 Hz. Furthermore, we used the EVS to observe laboratory cultures of six species of zooplankton and phytoplankton, confirming that they have species-specific motion periodicities of up to 41 Hz. We applied machine learning to automatically classify particles into five categories (four categories of zooplankton plus passive particles), which achieved an accuracy up to 86%. Our attempts to use the EVS for biological observations, especially focusing on its millisecond-scale temporal resolution and wide dynamic range provide a new avenue to investigate rapid and periodical motion and behaviour in small organisms. Given its compact size with low consumption of battery and memory, the EVS will likely be applicable in the near future for the automated monitoring of the behaviour of plankton by edge computing on autonomous floats, as well as quantifying rapid cellular-level activities under microscopy.",

    "abstract": "In many social living species, seeing conspecifics interacting can alter the behaviour of bystanders, leading to social contagion - the spread of behaviour or emotion among group members. Among primates, studies of a small number of species have explored bystanders responses to observing aggressive interactions, finding evidence that individuals that see such interactions are more likely to subsequently engage in aggressive behaviours themselves. To increase the taxonomic breadth of this body of research, working with semi-free ranging adult female Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus) at the Trentham Monkey Forest, Stoke-on-Trent, UK, we assessed bystanders responses to observing naturally occurring aggressive interactions. Data were collected under two conditions: (i) after observing an aggressive interaction between conspecifics and (ii) during a matched-control period, before which individuals did not observe aggression. Bystanders were significantly quicker to initiate an aggressive interaction themselves after observing an aggressive interaction than if they had not, providing evidence of behavioural contagion. There was no effect of observing aggression on the rates of self-directed behaviour (an indicator of anxiety), suggesting the negative emotional states associated with involvement in aggressive interactions did not spread to bystanders. The results of this study provide new insight into the nature and importance of visual contagion of behaviour among primates.",

    "abstract": "Larval zebrafish achieve neutral buoyancy by swimming up to the surface and taking in air through their mouths to inflate their swim bladders. We define this behavior as  surfacing. Little is known about the sensory basis for this underappreciated behavior of larval fish. A strong candidate is the mechanosensory lateral line, a hair cell-based sensory system that detects hydrodynamic information from sources like water currents, predators, prey, and surface waves. However, a role for the lateral line in mediating initial inflation of the swim bladder has not been reported.\n\nTo explore the connection between the lateral line and surfacing, we utilized a genetic mutant (lhfpl5b-/-) that renders the zebrafish lateral line insensitive to mechanical stimuli. We observe that approximately half of these lateral line mutants over-inflate their swim bladders during initial inflation and become positively buoyant. Thus, we hypothesize that larval zebrafish use their lateral line to moderate interactions with the air-water interface during surfacing to regulate swim bladder inflation. To test the hypothesis that lateral line defects are responsible for swim bladder over-inflation, we show exogenous air is required for the hyperinflation phenotype and transgenic rescue of hair cell function restores normal inflation. We also find that chemical ablation of anterior lateral line hair cells in wild type larvae causes hyperinflation. Furthermore, we show that manipulation of lateral line sensory information results in abnormal inflation. Finally, we report spatial and temporal differences in the surfacing behavior between wild type and lateral line mutant larvae. In summary, we propose a novel sensory basis for achieving neutral buoyancy where larval zebrafish use their lateral line to sense the air-water interface and regulate initial swim bladder inflation.",

IBP has been observed in one burying beetle by laboratory experiments, but has not been well reported under natural conditions. IBP and QP may occur under natural conditions in burying beetles.\n\nHere we focused on a burying beetle, Nicrophorus quadripunctatus. Ten broods, consisting of larvae and their parental female and male, were collected from a deciduous forest. To investigate the kin relationship between parents and larvae, eight microsatellite DNA loci were used.\n\nWe detected three types of parasitic larvae: 1) larva not related to either its parental female or male, 2) larva not related to its parental female, but unknown regarding its parental male, and 3) larva not related to its parental female, but related to its parental male. These results suggested that IBP and QP can occur with certain frequencies in the reproduction of N. quadripunctatus under natural conditions.

    "abstract": "Clinical applications for neural implant technologies are steadily advancing. Yet, despite clinical successes, neuroelectrode-based therapies require invasive neurosurgery and can subject local soft-tissues to micro-motion induced mechanical shear, leading to the development of peri-implant scaring. This reactive glial tissue creates a physical barrier to electrical signal propagation, leading to loss of device function. Although peri-electrode gliosis is a well described contributor to neuroelectrode failure, the mechanistic basis behind the initiation and progression of glial scarring remains poorly understood.\n\nHere, we develop an in silico model of electrode-induced shear stress to evaluate the evolution of the peri-electrode fluid-filled void, encompassing a solid and viscoelastic liquid/solid interface. This model was subsequently used to inform an in vitro parallel-plate flow model of micromotion mediated peri-electrode fluid shear stress.\n\nVentral mesencephalic E14 rat embryonic in vitro cultures exposed to physiologically relevant fluid shear exhibited upregulation of gliosis-associated proteins and the overexpression of two mechanosensitive ion channel receptors, PIEZO1 and TRPA1, confirmed in vivo in a neural probe induced rat glial scar model. Finally, it was shown in vitro that chemical inhibition/activation of PIEZO1 could exacerbate or attenuate astrocyte reactivity as induced by fluid shear stress and that this was mitochondrial dependant.\n\nTogether, our results suggests that mechanosensitive ion channels play a major role in the development of the neuroelectrode micromotion induced glial scar and that the modulation of PIEZO1 and TRPA1 through chemical agonist/antagonist may promote chronic electrode stability in vivo.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=144 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/523766v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (41K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@962f03org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e8a6adorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@116cbb6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19830da_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIPeri-electrode void progression is mediated by fluid flow shear stress\nC_LIO_LIOscillatory fluid flow shear stress replicates neuroelectrode glial scarring in vitro\nC_LIO_LIAstrocyte PIEZO1 and TRPA1 are upregulated at the peri-electrode region in response to electrode micromotion\nC_LIO_LIPIEZO1 pharmaceutical activation diminishes shear stress-induced gliosis\nC_LIO_LIPIEZO1 chemical inhibition exacerbates gliosis and reduces mitochondrial functions\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Conscious visual motion information follows a cortical pathway from the retina to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and on to the primary visual cortex (V1) before arriving at the middle temporal visual area (MT/V5). Alternative subcortical pathways that bypass V1 are thought to convey unconscious visual information. One flows from the retina to the pulvinar (PUL) and on to MT; while the other directly connects the LGN to MT. Evidence for these pathways comes from non-human primates and modest-sized studies in humans with brain lesions. Thus, the aim of the current study was to reconstruct these pathways in a large sample of neurotypical individuals and to determine the degree to which these pathways are myelinated, suggesting information flow is rapid. We used the publicly available 7T (N = 98;  discovery) and 3T (N = 381;  validation) diffusion MRI datasets from the Human Connectome Project to reconstruct the PUL-MT and LGN-MT pathways. We found more fibre tracts with greater density in the left hemisphere. Although the left PUL-MT path was denser, the bilateral LGN-MT tracts were more heavily myelinated, suggesting faster signal transduction. We suggest that this apparent discrepancy may be due to  adaptive myelination caused by more frequent use of the LGN-MT pathway that leads to greater myelination and faster overall signal transmission.",

We also examined cutaneous and proprioceptive sensory behaviors with the von Frey test, radiant heat assay, rotarod, and grid-walk tests. Adv-KO-SCOT mice exhibited myelination deficits, altered morphology of putative A{delta} soma from the dorsal root ganglion, reduced cutaneous innervation, and abnormal innervation of the spinal dorsal horn compared to wildtype mice. Synapsin 1-Cre-driven knockout of Oxct1 confirmed deficits in epidermal innervation following a loss of ketone oxidation. Loss of peripheral axonal ketolysis was further associated with proprioceptive deficits, yet Adv-KO-SCOT mice did not exhibit drastically altered cutaneous mechanical and thermal thresholds. Knockout of Oxct1 in peripheral sensory neurons resulted in histological abnormalities and severe proprioceptive deficits in mice. We conclude that ketone metabolism is essential for the development of the somatosensory nervous system. These findings also suggest that decreased ketone oxidation in the somatosensory nervous system may explain the neurological symptoms of Friedreichs ataxia.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease is characterized by abnormal {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) plaque accumulation, tau hyperphosphorylation, reactive oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and synaptic loss. Myricetin, a dietary flavonoid, has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in vitro and in vivo. Here, we aimed to elucidate the mechanism and pathways involved in myricetins protective effect on the toxicity induced by the A{beta}42 oligomer. Neuronal SH-SY5Y cells were pretreated with myricetin before incubation with A{beta}42 oligomer. The levels of pre- and postsynaptic proteins, mitochondrial division and fusion proteins, glycogen synthase kinase-3 {beta} (GSK-3{beta}) and extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 were assessed by Western blotting. Flow cytometry assays for mitochondrial membrane potential (JC1) and reactive oxidative stress, as well immunofluorescence staining for lipid peroxidation (4-HNE) and DNA oxidation (8-OHdG), were performed. We found that myricetin prevented A{beta}42 oligomer-induced tau phosphorylation and the reduction in pre/postsynaptic proteins. In addition, myricetin reduced reactive oxygen species generation, lipid peroxidation, and DNA oxidation induced by the A{beta}42 oligomer. Moreover, myricetin prevented the A{beta}42 oligomer-induced reduction in mitochondrial fusion proteins (mitofusin-1, mitofusin-2), fission protein (dynamin-related protein 1) phosphorylation, and mitochondrial membrane potential via the associated GSK-3{beta} and ERK 1/2 signaling pathways. In conclusion, this study provides new insight into the neuroprotective mechanism of myricetin against A{beta}42 oligomer-induced toxicity.",

    "abstract": "The potential negative impact of head movement during fMRI has long been appreciated. Although a variety of prospective and retrospective approaches have been developed to help mitigate these effects, reducing head movement in the first place remains the most appealing strategy for optimizing data quality. Real-time interventions, in which participants are provided feedback regarding their scan-to-scan motion, have recently shown promise in reducing motion during resting state fMRI. However, whether feedback might similarly reduce motion during task-based fMRI is an open question. In particular, it is unclear whether participants can effectively monitor motion feedback while attending to task-related demands. Here we assessed whether a combination of real-time and between-run feedback could reduce head motion during task-based fMRI. During an auditory word repetition task, 78 adult participants (aged 19-81) were pseudorandomly assigned to receive feedback or not. Feedback was provided FIRMM software that used real-time calculation of realignment parameters to estimate participant motion. We quantified movement using framewise displacement (FD). We found that motion feedback resulted in a statistically significant reduction in participant head motion, with a small-to-moderate effect size (reducing average FD from 0.347 to 0.282). Reductions were most apparent in high-motion events. We conclude that under some circumstances real-time feedback may reduce head motion during task-based fMRI, although its effectiveness may depend on the specific participant population and task demands of a given study.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionIn the progressive phase of multiple sclerosis (MS), the hampered differentiation capacity of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) eventually results in remyelination failure. We have previously shown that DNA methylation of Id2/Id4 is highly involved in OPC differentiation and remyelination. In this study, we took an unbiased approach by determining genome-wide DNA methylation patterns within chronically demyelinated MS lesions and investigated how certain epigenetic signatures relate to OPC differentiation capacity.\n\nMethodsWe compared genome-wide DNA methylation and transcriptional profiles between chronically demyelinated MS lesions and matched normal-appearing white matter (NAWM), making use of post-mortem brain tissue (n=9/group). DNA methylation differences that inversely correlated with mRNA expression of their corresponding genes were validated for their cell-type specificity in laser-captured OPCs using pyrosequencing. The CRISPR-dCas9-DNMT3a/TET1 system was used to epigenetically edit human-iPSC-derived oligodendrocytes to assess the effect on cellular differentiation.\n\nResultsOur data show hypermethylation of CpGs within genes that cluster in gene ontologies related to myelination and axon ensheathment. Cell type-specific validation indicates a region-dependent hypermethylation of MBP, encoding for myelin basic protein, in OPCs obtained from white matter lesions compared to NAWM-derived OPCs. By altering the DNA methylation state of specific CpGs within the promotor region of MBP, using epigenetic editing, we show that cellular differentiation can be bidirectionally manipulated using the CRISPR-dCas9-DNMT3a/TET1 system in vitro.\n\nConclusionOur data indicate that OPCs within chronically demyelinated MS lesions acquire an inhibitory phenotype, which translates into hypermethylation of crucial myelination related genes. Altering the epigenetic status of MBP can restore the differentiation capacity of OPCs and possibly boost (re)myelination.",

    "abstract": "Increased neurotrophic support, including insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), is an important aspect of the adaptive response to ischemic insult. However, recent findings indicate that the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) in neurons plays a detrimental role in the response to stroke. Thus, we investigated the role of astrocytic IGF-IR on ischemic insults by deleting it using tamoxifen-regulated Cre deletion in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) astrocytes, a major cellular component in the response to injury. Ablation of IGF-IR in astrocytes (GFAP-IGF-IR KO mice) resulted in larger ischemic lesions, greater blood-brain-barrier disruption and more deteriorated sensorimotor coordination. RNAseq detetected increases in inflammatory, cell adhesion and angiogenic pathways, while the expression of various classical biomarkers of response to ischemic lesion, including aquaporin 4, complement 1q subunit a, early growth response protein 1, and C-C motif chemokine ligand 2, were significantly increased at the lesion site compared to control littermates. While serum IGF-I levels after injury were decreased in both control and GFAP-IR KO mice, brain IGF-I mRNA expression show larger increases in the latter. Further, greater damage was also accompanied by altered glial reactivity as reflected by changes in the morphology of GFAP astrocytes, and relative abundance of ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 microglia. These results suggest a protective role for astrocytic IGF-IR in the response to ischemic injury.",

    "abstract": "Salience-driven exogenous and goal-driven endogenous attentional selection are two distinct forms of attention that guide selection of task-irrelevant and task-relevant targets in primates. During conflict i.e, when salience and goal each favor the selection of different targets, endogenous selection of the task-relevant target relies on top-down control. Top-down attentional control mechanisms enable selection of the task-relevant target by limiting the influence of sensory information. Although the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) is known to mediate top-down control, the neuronal mechanisms of top-down control of attentional selection are poorly understood. Here, using a two-target free-choice luminance-reward selection task, we demonstrate that visual-movement neurons and not visual neurons or movement neurons encode exogenous and endogenous selection. We then show that coherent-beta activity selectively modulates mechanisms of exogenous selection specifically during conflict and consequently may support top-down control. These results reveal the VM-neuron-specific network mechanisms of attentional selection and suggest a functional role for beta-frequency coherent neural dynamics in the modulation of sensory communication channels for the top-down control of attentional selection.",

However, its intricate interplay with other history factors in PDM challenges a principled account of the history effects of feedback. One popular account, grounded in animal behavior and extended to human behavior, grafted the principle proven successful in reward-based decision-making-- reinforcement-learning--onto the PDM processes. It assumes that decision-makers, although engaged in PDM, treat feedback as rewards from which they learn choice values. Here we report that human decision-makers do not conform to this assumption. Instead, humans acted like treating feedback as evidence for a specific world state and combining it with sensory evidence to learn the statistical structure crucial to perform a PDM task. A Bayesian implementation of our account reproduces human history effects, both retrospectively and prospectively, with an unprecedented level of correspondence and finesse.",

    "abstract": "The posterior cingulate cortex (mainly area 23) in human and non-human primates is a critical component of the default mode network and is involved in many neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases such as Alzheimers disease, autism, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and schizophrenia. However, cingulate area 23 has not yet identified in rodents and other lower mammals and this makes modeling related circuits and diseases in rodents very difficult. Using a comparative approach and unique connectional patterns the present study has uncovered the location and extent of rodent equivalent of the primate cingulate area 23. Like in monkeys, area 23 but not adjoining retrosplenial and visual areas in the rats and mice displays strong reciprocal connections with the anteromedial thalamic nucleus. Rodent area 23 also reciprocally connects with the medial pulvinar and claustrum as well as with the anterior cingulate, granular retrosplenial, medial orbitofrontal, postrhinal, and visual and auditory association cortices. The rodent A23 also projects to the subcortical effectors such as the dorsal striatum, ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, zona incerta, pretectal nucleus, superior colliculus, periaqueductal gray, and brainstem reticular formation. All these connectional findings support the versatility of area 23 in the integration and modulation of multimodal information underlying spatial processing, episodic memory, self-reflection, attention, value assessment and many adaptive behaviors. Additionally, this study also suggests that the rodents can be used to model primate and human area 23 in future structural, functional, pathological and neuromodulation studies.",

    "abstract": "Cochlear hair cell loss is a leading cause of deafness in humans. Neighboring supporting cells have some capacity to regenerate hair cells. However, their regenerative potential sharply declines as supporting cells undergo maturation (postnatal day 5 in mice). We recently reported that reactivation of the RNA-binding protein LIN28B restores the hair cell-regenerative potential of P5 cochlear supporting cells. Here, we identify the LIN28B target Trim71 as a novel and equally potent enhancer of supporting cell plasticity. TRIM71 is a critical regulator of stem cell behavior and cell reprogramming, however, its role in cell regeneration is poorly understood. Employing an organoid-based assay, we show that TRIM71 reactivation increases the mitotic and hair cell-forming potential of P5 cochlear supporting cells by facilitating their de-differentiation into progenitor-like cells. Our mechanistic work indicates that TRIM71s RNA-binding activity is essential for such ability, and our transcriptomic analysis identifies gene modules that are linked to TRIM71 and LIN28B-mediated supporting cell reprogramming. Furthermore, our study uncovers that the TRIM71-LIN28B target Hmga2 is essential for supporting cell self-renewal and hair cell formation.",

To determine whether there are shared mechanisms for perceptual consciousness across sensory modalities, here we developed a task to test within the auditory domain. Participants (n=31) completed an auditory perceptual threshold task while undergoing intracranial electroencephalography (icEEG) for intractable epilepsy. Intracranial recordings from over 2,800 grey matter electrodes representing widespread cortical coverage were analyzed for power in the high gamma range (40-115 Hz)--a frequency range that reflects local neural activity. For trials that were perceived, we find activity in early auditory regions which is accompanied by activity in the right caudal middle frontal gyrus, and shortly thereafter by activity in non-auditory thalamus. This is followed by a wave of activity that sweeps through the higher auditory association regions and into parietal and frontal cortices, similar to the wave observed in our visual conscious perception paradigm. However, for not perceived trials, we find that significant activity is restricted to early auditory regions (and areas immediately adjacent to the Sylvian fissure). These findings show that the broad anatomical regions of cortical and subcortical networks involved in auditory perception are similar to the networks observed with vision, suggesting shared general mechanisms for conscious perception.",

Here, we dissociated cortical interactions sharing common information from those encoding complementary information during prediction error processing. To this end, we computed co-information, an information-theoretical measure that distinguishes redundant from synergistic information among brain signals. We analyzed auditory and frontal electrocorticography (ECoG) signals in five common awake marmosets performing two distinct auditory oddball tasks and investigated to what extent event-related potentials (ERP) and broadband (BB) dynamics encoded redundant and synergistic information during auditory prediction error processing. In both tasks, we observed multiple patterns of synergy across the entire cortical hierarchy with distinct dynamics. The information conveyed by ERPs and BB signals was highly synergistic even at lower stages of the hierarchy in the auditory cortex, as well as between auditory and frontal regions. Using a brain-constrained neural network, we simulated the spatio-temporal patterns of synergy and redundancy observed in the experimental results and further demonstrated that the emergence of synergy between auditory and frontal regions requires the presence of strong, long-distance, feedback and feedforward connections. These results indicate that the distributed representations of prediction error signals across the cortical hierarchy can be highly synergistic.",

    "abstract": "Intracranial electrodes are used clinically for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes, notably in drug-refractory epilepsy (DRE) among others. Visualization and quantification of the energy delivered through such electrodes is key to understanding how the resulting electric fields modulate neuronal excitability, i.e. the ratio between excitation and inhibition. Quantifying the electric field induced by electrical stimulation in a patient-specific manner is challenging, because these electric fields depend on a number of factors: electrode trajectory with respect to folded brain anatomy, biophysical (electrical conductivity / permittivity) properties of brain tissue and stimulation parameters such as electrode contacts position and intensity.\n\nHere, we aimed to evaluate various biophysical models for characterizing the electric fields induced by electrical stimulation in DRE patients undergoing stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) recordings in the context of pre-surgical evaluation. This stimulation was performed with multiple-contact intracranial electrodes used in routine clinical practice. We introduced realistic 3D models of electrode geometry and trajectory in the neocortex. For the electrodes, we compared point (0D) and line (1D) sources approximations. For brain tissue, we considered three configurations of increasing complexity: a 6-layer spherical model, a toy model with a sulcus representation, replicating results from previous approaches; and went beyond the state-of-the-art by using a realistic head model geometry.\n\nElectrode geometry influenced the electric field distribution at close distances (~3 mm) from the electrode axis. For larger distances, the volume conductor geometry and electrical conductivity dominated electric field distribution. These results are the first step towards accurate and computationally tractable patient-specific models of electric fields induced by neuromodulation and neurostimulation procedures.",

    "abstract": "The dorsolateral striatum (DLS) is linked to the learning and honing of action routines. However, the DLS is also important for performing behaviors that have been successful in the past. The learning function can be thought of as prospective, helping to plan ongoing actions to be efficient and often optimal. The performance function is more retrospective, helping the animal continue to behave in a way that had worked previously. How the DLS manages this all is curious. What happens when a learned behavior becomes sub-optimal due to environment changes. In this case, the prospective function of the DLS would cause animals to (adaptively) learn and plan more optimal actions. In contrast, the retrospective function would cause animals to (maladaptively) favor the old behavior. Here we find that, during a change in learned task rules, DLS inhibition causes animals to adjust less rapidly to the new task (and to behave less vigorously) in a  maladaptive way. Yet, when the task is changed back to the initially learned rules, DLS inhibition instead causes a rapid and vigorous adjustment of behavior in an  adaptive way. These results show that inhibiting the DLS biases behavior towards initially acquired strategies, implying a more retrospective outlook in action selection when the DLS is offline. Thus, an active DLS could encourage planning and learning action routines more prospectively. Moreover, the DLS control over behavior can appear to be either advantageous/flexible or disadvantageous/inflexible depending on task context, and its control over vigor can change depending on task context.\n\nSignificant StatementBasal ganglia networks aid behavioral learning (a prospective planning function) but also favor the use of old behaviors (a retrospective performance function), making it unclear what happens when learned behaviors become suboptimal. Here we inhibit the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) as animals encounter a change in task rules, and again when they shift back to those learned task rules. DLS inhibition reduces adjustment to new task rules (and reduces behavioral vigor), but it increases adjustment back to the initially learned task rules later (and increases vigor). Thus, in both cases, DLS inhibition favored the use of the initially learned behavioral strategy, which could appear either maladaptive or adaptive. We suggest that the DLS might promote a prospective orientation of action control.",

    "abstract": "Evidence suggests that subcortical hyperdopaminergia alters cognitive function in schizophrenia and antipsychotic drugs (APD) fail at rescuing cognitive deficits in patients. In a previous study, we showed that blocking D2 dopamine receptors (D2R), a core action of APD, led to profound reshaping of mesohippocampal fibers, deficits in synaptic transmission and impairments in learning and memory in the mouse hippocampus (HP). However, it is currently unknown how excessive dopamine affects HP-related cognitive functions, and how APD would impact HP functions in such a state. After verifying the presence of DAT-positive neuronal projections in the ventral (temporal), but not in the dorsal (septal), part of the HP, GBR12935, a blocker of dopamine transporter (DAT), was infused in the CA1 of adult C57Bl/6 mice to produce local hyperdopaminergia. Chronic GBR12935 infusion in temporal CA1 induced a mild learning impairment in the Morris Water Maze and abolished long-term recognition memory in novel-object (NORT) and object-place recognition tasks (OPRT). Deficits were accompanied by a significant decrease in DAT+ mesohippocampal fibers. Intrahippocampal or systemic treatment with sulpiride during GBR infusions improved the NORT deficit but not that of OPRT. In vitro application of GBR on hippocampal slices abolished long-term depression (LTD) of fEPSP in temporal CA1. LTD was rescued by co-application with sulpiride. In conclusion, chronic DAT blockade in temporal CA1 profoundly altered mesohippocampal modulation of hippocampal functions. Contrary to previous observations in normodopaminergic mice, antagonising D2Rs was beneficial for cognitive functions in the context of hippocampal hyperdopaminergia.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental task for the brain is to generate predictions of future sensory inputs, and signal errors in these predictions. Many neurons have been shown to signal omitted stimuli during periodic stimulation, even in the retina. However, the mechanisms of this error signaling are unclear. Here we show that depressing inhibitory synapses enable the retina to signal an omitted stimulus in a flash sequence. While ganglion cells, the retinal output, responded to an omitted flash with a constant latency over many frequencies of the flash sequence, we found that this was not the case once inhibition was blocked. We built a simple circuit model and showed that depressing inhibitory synapses were a necessary component to reproduce our experimental findings. We also generated new predictions with this model, that we confirmed experimentally. Depressing inhibitory synapses could thus be a key component to generate the predictive responses observed in many brain areas.",

    "abstract": "Chemical cross talks between Mycolicibacterium septicum HEK138M and Bacillus subtilis 168 affect the bacterial morphology of Streptomyces variegatus HEK138A. We found that S. variegatus exhibits unusual hyphae branching by the bacterial interaction. We aimed to elucidate the mechanism by performing activity guided purification of substances that induce the unusual cell morphology. We found that pyrogallol, a redox active aromatic small molecule induced significant hyphae branching in S. variegatus and the activity was also observed in some of other Streptomyces species. Interestingly, the pyrogallol activity was diminished by adding catalase, which broke down H2O2. To further confirm the involvement, H2O2 was tested and similar activity which induced hyphal branching was observed. This indicates that reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by redox-active compound (RAC) is the inducing factor of hyphae branching. Further investigation revealed that pyrogallol was generated by NahG enzyme homolog of M. septicum using 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid as substrate by heterologous expression in E. coli. Moreover, co-culture with gene knock-out mutants revealed that 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid was supplied by B. subtilis produced as intermediate of bacterial siderophore bacillibactin. Since the hyphae branching of vegetative mycelium can increase the density of filamentous network and consequently help secure the milieu in soil, our results suggested that those filamentous soil bacteria use ROS which can be supplied from plant derived RAC as a signal. As those RAC ubiquitously exist in soil environment, the system will be beneficial for sensing the nutrient sources in addition to the generally considered defensive response to oxidative stress.\n\nImportanceThe characterization of interactions between three or more bacteria are lacking as these interactions are visually imperceptible in general. Our current study revealed changes of morphological behavior by the bacterial interaction. This study showed that hydrogen peroxide generated by redox-active compound derived from a breakdown product of siderophore can significantly increase the number of hyphae tip extension in filamentous bacteria. Our result implies the existence of oxidative response system using a low amount of reactive oxygen species as an integrated signal to sense the plant-derived carbon source by the filamentous soil bacteria. As a result of sensing, filamentous soil bacteria may decide whether the hypha tip should be extended to further explore the area or increase the tips to densify filamentous network to monopolize the nutrients in the milieu.",

    "abstract": "Environmental DNA (eDNA) once shed can exist in numerous states with varying behaviors including degradation rates and transport potential. In this study we consider three states of eDNA: 1) a membrane-bound state referring to DNA enveloped in a cellular or organellar membrane, 2) a dissolved state defined as the extracellular DNA molecule in the environment without any interaction with other particles, and 3) an adsorbed state defined as extracellular DNA adsorbed to a particle surface in the environment. Capturing, isolating, and analyzing a target state of eDNA provides utility for better interpretation of eDNA degradation rates and transport potential. While methods for separating different states of DNA have been developed, they remain poorly evaluated due to the lack of state-controlled experimentation. We evaluated the methods for separating states of eDNA from a single sample by spiking DNA from three different species to represent the three states of eDNA as state-specific controls. We used chicken DNA to represent the dissolved state, cultured mouse cells for the membrane-bound state, and salmon DNA adsorbed to clay particles as the adsorbed state. We performed the separation in three water matrices, two environmental and one synthetic, spiked with the three eDNA states. The membrane-bound state was the only state that was isolated with minimal contamination from non-target states. The membrane-bound state also had the highest recovery (54.11 {+/-} 19.24 %), followed by the adsorbed state (5.08 {+/-} 2.28 %), and the dissolved state had the lowest total recovery (2.21 {+/-} 2.36 %). This study highlights the potential to sort the states of eDNA from a single sample and independently analyze them for more informed biodiversity assessments. However, further method development is needed to improve recovery and reduce cross-contamination.",

In plant chloroplasts, the Tat pathway utilizes the protonmotive force (PMF) to drive protein translocation. However, in bacteria, it has been shown that Tat transport depends only on the {Delta}{psi} component of PMF in vitro. To investigate the comprehensive PMF requirement in Escherichia coli, we have developed the first real-time assay to monitor Tat transport utilizing the NanoLuc Binary Technology (NanoBiT) in E. coli spheroplasts. This luminescence assay allows for continuous monitoring of Tat transport with high-resolution, making it possible to observe subtle changes in transport in response to different treatments. By applying the NanoLuc assay, we report that, under acidic conditions, {Delta}pH, in addition to {Delta}{psi}, contributes energetically to Tat transport in vivo in E. coli spheroplasts. These results provide novel insight into the mechanism of energy utilization by the Tat pathway.",

    "abstract": "Scrub typhus is a poorly studied but life-threatening disease caused by the intracellular bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi (Ot). Cellular and humoral immunity in Ot-infected patients is not long-lasting, waning as early as one-year post-infection; however, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To date, no studies have examined germinal center (GC) or B cell responses in Ot-infected humans or experimental animals. This study was aimed at evaluating humoral immune responses at acute stages of severe Ot infection and possible mechanisms underlying B cell dysfunction. Following inoculation with Ot Karp, a clinically dominant strain known to cause lethal infection in C57BL/6 mice, we measured antigen-specific antibody titers, revealing IgG2c as the dominant isotype induced by infection. Splenic GC responses were evaluated by immunohistology, co-staining for B cells (B220), T cells (CD3), and GCs (GL-7). Organized GCs were evident at day 4 post-infection (D4), but they were nearly absent at D8, accompanied by scattered T cells throughout splenic tissues. Flow cytometry revealed comparable numbers of GC B cells and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells at D4 and D8, indicating that GC collapse was not due to excessive death of these cell subtypes at D8. B cell RNAseq analysis revealed significant differences in expression of genes associated with B cell adhesion and co-stimulation at D8 versus D4. The significant downregulation of S1PR2 (a GC-specific adhesion gene) was most evident at D8, correlating with disrupted GC formation. Signaling pathway analysis uncovered downregulation of 71% of B cell activation genes at D8, suggesting attenuation of B cell activation during severe infection. This is the first study showing the disruption of B/T cell microenvironment and dysregulation of B cell responses during Ot infection, which may help understand the transient immunity associated with scrub typhus.\n\nAuthor SummaryScrub typhus is an understudied disease caused by the intracellular bacterium O. tsutsugamushi. A hallmark of scrub typhus is the unexplained, non-durable immunity after infection. While cellular immune responses are known to be important for controlling this infection, our understanding of B cell and GC responses remains limited. In this study, we examined B cell activation and GC responses using our recently established murine model of severe scrub typhus. We measured bacterial antigen-specific antibody titers and identified IgG2c, an IFN-{gamma}-driven isotype, as the major IgG subtype. We also found that O. tsutsugamushi infection disrupted spleen morphology, exemplified by randomly dispersed T cells and lost GC structures. Transcriptomic analysis of purified splenic B cells demonstrated reduced expression of genes encoding critical adhesion and co-stimulation molecules, including GC-adhesion gene S1PR2, at severe stages of infection. Several humoral immune response pathways relevant to B cell receptor signaling, B cell activation and differentiation were significantly downregulated during infection. This study is the first report describing humoral immunity in a scrub typhus mouse model and provides detailed evidence that B cell and GC responses are impaired during acute infection.",

For agri-food sciences, identifying species in diverse food ecosystems is key for both food sustainability and food security. The aim of this study was to compare metabarcoding pipelines and markers to determine fungal diversity in food ecosystems, from Illumina short reads. We built mock communities combining the most representative fungal species in fermented meat, cheese, wine and bread. Four barcodes (ITS1, ITS2, D1/D2 and RPB2) were tested for each mock and on real fermented products. We created a database, including all mock species sequences for each barcode to compensate for the lack of curated data in available databases. Four bioinformatics tools (DADA2, QIIME, FROGS and a combination of DADA2 and FROGS) were compared. Our results clearly showed that the combined DADA2 and FROGS tool gave the most accurate results. Most mock community species were not identified by the RPB2 barcode due to unsuccessful barcode amplification. When comparing the three rDNA markers, ITS markers performed better than D1D2, as they are better represented in public databases and have better specificity to distinguish species. Between ITS1 and ITS2, differences in the best marker were observed according to the studied ecosystem. While ITS2 is best suited to characterize cheese, wine and fermented meat communities, ITS1 performs better for sourdough bread communities. Our results also emphasized the need for a dedicated database and enriched fungal-specific public databases with novel barcode sequences for 118 major species in food ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii is responsible for toxoplasmosis, a disease that can be serious when contracted during pregnancy, but can also be a threat for immunocompromised individuals. Acute infection is associated with the tachyzoite form that spreads rapidly within the host. However, under stress conditions, some parasites can differentiate into cyst-forming bradyzoites, residing mainly in the central nervous system, retina and muscle. Because this latent form of the parasite is resistant to all currently available treatments, and is central to persistence and transmission of the parasite, new specific therapeutic strategies targeting this developmental stage need to be discovered.\n\nT. gondii contains a plastid of endosymbiotic origin called the apicoplast, which is an appealing drug target because it is essential for tachyzoite viability and contains several key metabolic pathways that are largely absent from the mammalian host. Its function in bradyzoites, however, is unknown. Our objective was thus to study the contribution of the apicoplast to the viability and persistence of bradyzoites during chronic toxoplasmosis.\n\nWe have used complementary strategies based on stage-specific promoters to generate conditional bradyzoite mutants of essential apicoplast genes. Our results show that specifically targeting the apicoplast in both in vitro or in vivo-differentiated bradyzoites leads to a loss of long-term bradyzoite viability, highlighting the importance of this organelle for this developmental stage. This validates the apicoplast as a potential area to look for new therapeutic targets in bradyzoites, with the aim to interfere with this currently incurable parasite stage.\n\nSignificance StatementIn its intermediate hosts, the parasite Toxoplasma gondii can persist as a cyst-contained developmental form that might reactivate and cause severe pathologies. Importantly, this form is resistant to current anti-parasitic drugs. T. gondii harbors a plastid of endosymbiotic origin called the apicoplast, containing important and potentially druggable metabolic pathways, but whose contribution to the fitness and viability of persistent parasites has never been assessed. We have generated conditional mutants specifically affected for the homeostasis of the apicoplast in cyst-contained parasites and showed that this organelle is important for persistence of these particular developmental forms. Our work thus validates the apicoplast as a relevant drug target in the context of chronic T. gondii infection.",

    "abstract": "Vibrio alginolyticus forms a single flagellum at its cell pole. FlhF and FlhG are known to be the main proteins responsible for the polar formation of single flagellum. FlhF, which belongs to the signal recognition particle (SRP)-type GTPase family, localizes at the cell pole and initiates flagellar generation. In contrast, FlhG negatively regulates flagellar numbers. Furthermore, MS-ring formation in the flagellar basal body appears to be an initiation step for flagellar assembly. The MS-ring is formed by a single protein, FliF, which has two transmembrane (TM) segments and a large periplasmic region. We had shown that FlhF was required for the polar localization of Vibrio FliF, and FlhF facilitated MS-ring formation when FliF was overexpressed in E. coli cells. These results suggest that FlhF interacts with FliF to facilitate MS-ring formation. Here, we attempted to detect this interaction using Vibrio FliF fragments fused to a tag of Glutathione S-transferase (GST) in E. coli. We found that the N-terminal 108 residues of FliF, including the first TM segment and the periplasmic region, could pull FlhF down. In the first step, the SRP and its receptor are involved in the transport of membrane proteins to target them, which delivers them to the translocon. FlhF may have a similar or enhanced function as SRP, which binds to a region rich in hydrophobic residues.\n\nIMPORTANCEVibrio alginolyticus forms only a single flagellum at the cell pole by regulators of FlhF and FlhG. FlhF regulates positively the formation of flagella and is required for polar positioning of the flagellum. FliF, the two transmembrane (TM) segments and a large periplasmic region, forms the MS ring of flagellar basal body in the membrane. Previous studies suggest that FlhF interacts with FliF to facilitate MS ring formation at the cell pole, but the interaction has not been detected. Here, we show the evidence that FlhF interacts with FliF at residues including the first TM segment and following periplasmic region. The hydrophobic residues of this region seem to be important for the interaction.",

These included so far unknown targets such as the 5 untranslated region of the response regulator gene lsiR; trxA, apcE and atpI mRNAs, encoding proteins related to energy metabolism; as well as sbtB and rbcLXS encoding proteins relevant for carbon fixation. Cyanobacterial 5 sensing is important for the maturation of rRNA and several tRNAs, including tRNAGluUUC. This tRNA activates glutamate for tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in plant chloroplasts and most prokaryotes. We found that increased RNase activities leads to a higher copy number of the major Synechocystis plasmids pSYSA and pSYSM. The results provide a first step towards understanding the relative importance of different target mechanisms of RNase E outside Escherichia coli.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are adaptable organelles with diverse cellular functions critical to whole-body metabolic homeostasis. While chronic endurance exercise training is known to alter mitochondrial activity, these adaptations have not yet been systematically characterized. Here, the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) mapped the longitudinal, multi-omic changes in mitochondrial analytes across 19 tissues in male and female rats endurance trained for 1, 2, 4 or 8 weeks. Training elicited substantial changes in the adrenal gland, brown adipose, colon, heart and skeletal muscle, while we detected mild responses in the brain, lung, small intestine and testes. The colon response was characterized by non-linear dynamics that resulted in upregulation of mitochondrial function that was more prominent in females. Brown adipose and adrenal tissues were characterized by substantial downregulation of mitochondrial pathways. Training induced a previously unrecognized robust upregulation of mitochondrial protein abundance and acetylation in the liver, and a concomitant shift in lipid metabolism. The striated muscles demonstrated a highly coordinated response to increase oxidative capacity, with the majority of changes occurring in protein abundance and post-translational modifications. We identified exercise upregulated networks that are downregulated in human type 2 diabetes and liver cirrhosis. In both cases HSD17B10, a central dehydrogenase in multiple metabolic pathways and mitochondrial tRNA maturation, was the main hub. In summary, we provide a multi-omic, cross-tissue atlas of the mitochondrial response to training and identify candidates for prevention of disease-associated mitochondrial dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial cells (ECs) are constantly exposed to mechanical forces in the form of fluid shear stress, extracellular stiffness, and cyclic strain. How these forces are sensed by ECs remains an understudied aspect in the homeostatic regulation of the circulatory system. Angiomotin-like 2 (AmotL2) is localised to EC junctions and is required for alignment and actin reorganisation under conditions of high shear stress. Here we show that AmotL2 crucially regulates transcription and promotor activity of the YAP gene. Functionally, density-dependent proliferation of ECs in vitro and proliferation of a subpopulation of ECs within the inner aortic arch, were both reliant on AmotL2 and Yap/Taz endothelial expression in vivo. Mechanistically, depletion of AmotL2 led to altered nuclear morphology, chromatin accessibility and suppression of YAP-promotor activity through increased H3K27me3 mediated by the polycromb repressive complex component EZH2. Our data describe a previously unknown role for junctional mechanotransduction in shaping the epigenetic landscape and transcriptional regulation of YAP in vascular homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) fuel discrete biosynthetic pathways to multiply and differentiate into specific cell lineages; with undifferentiated hMSCs showing reliance on glycolysis. hMSCs differentiating towards an osteogenic phenotype rely on oxidative phosphorylation as an energy source. Here, the metabolic profile of hMSCs was profiled during osteogenic differentiation over 14 days using a non-invasive live-cell imaging platform- two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (2P-FLIM) which images and measures NADH fluorescence. During osteogenesis, we observe a higher dependence on oxidative phosphorylation for cellular energy; concomitant with an increased reliance on anabolic pathways. We validated this metabolic profile using qPCR and extracellular metabolite analysis and observed a higher reliance on glutaminolysis in the earlier time-points of osteogenic differentiation. Based on the results obtained, we sought to promote glutaminolysis further during osteogenic differentiation. An indirect method of promoting glutaminolysis was explored so as to not impact cellular differentiation. As Lactate has been shown to promote glutamine uptake via c-Myc activation triggering expression of glutamine transmembrane transporters and glutaminase 1; we chose to increase extracellular lactate concentrations to drive increased glutaminolysis rates leading to higher levels of mineral deposition and osteogenic gene expression. Lactate supplementation of osteogenic medium also promoted upregulation of lactate metabolism and increased the expression of transmembrane cellular lactate transporters. Higher rates of lactate dehydrogenase gene expression coupled with higher NADH fluorescence intensity demonstrate a conversion of lactate to pyruvate. During this conversion, NADH is formed by the reverse enzymatic reaction of lactate dehydrogenase resulting in increased NADH fluorescence intensity. In order to evaluate the importance of glutaminolysis and lactate metabolism in osteogenic differentiation, these metabolic pathways were shut down using BPTES and -CHC respectively which led to reduced hMSC mineralisation. In summary, we demonstrate that hMSCs osteogenic differentiation has a temporal metabolic profile and shift that is observed as early as day 3 of cell culture. Osteogenic differentiation was demonstrated to be directly dependent on OxPhos and on glutaminolysis and validated using biochemical assays. Furthermore, extracellular lactate is an essential metabolite to ensure osteogenic differentiation as a metabolic fuel and signalling molecule to promote glutaminolysis. These findings have significant impact in generating potent approaches towards bone tissue engineering in vitro and in vivo by engaging directly with metabolite driven osteogenesis.",

This is due in part to the scarcity of effective targets for BBB crossing, the identification of which is the crucial first step of drug development. Here, we leveraged a panel of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) previously identified through directed evolution for improved BBB transport to reverse engineer protein targets for enhanced BBB crossing. We identify both murine-restricted Ly6c1 and primate-conserved carbonic anhydrase IV (Car4; CA4) as novel receptors for crossing the BBB. We demonstrate how these receptors can unlock new experimental and computational target-focused engineering strategies by creating the enhanced Ly6c1-binding vector AAV-PHP.eC and by applying AlphaFold2-enabled in silico methods to rank capsids against identified receptors and generate capsid-receptor binding models. Here, with Car4, we add a completely new receptor to the very short list currently available for crossing the BBB in humans and, with Ly6c1, we validate a pipeline for receptor-targeted engineering. The identification of Car4/CA4 and structural insights from computational modeling provide new paths toward human brain-penetrant chemicals (drugs) and biologicals (including gene delivery).",

    "abstract": "1.Isoprene is a clear, colorless, volatile 5-carbon hydrocarbon that is one monomer of all cellular isoprenoids and a platform chemical with multiple applications in industry. Many plants have evolved isoprene synthases (IspSs) with the capacity to liberate isoprene from dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) as part of cellular protection mechanisms. Isoprene is hydrophobic and volatile, rapidly leaves plant tissues and is one of the main carbon emission sources from vegetation globally. The universality of isoprenoid metabolism allows volatile isoprene production from microbes expressing heterologous IspSs. Here, we compared heterologous overexpression from the nuclear genome and localization into the plastid of four plant terpene synthases (TPs) in the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Using sealed vial mixotrophic cultivation, direct quantification of isoprene production was achieved from the headspace of living cultures, with the highest isoprene production observed in algae expressing the Ipomoea batatas IspS. Perturbations of the downstream carotenoid pathway through keto carotenoid biosynthesis enhanced isoprene titers, which could be further enhanced by increasing flux towards DMAPP through heterologous co-expression of a yeast isopentenyl-PP delta isomerase. Multiplexed controlled-environment testing revealed that cultivation temperature, rather than illumination intensity, was the main factor affecting isoprene yield from the engineered alga. This is the first report of heterologous isoprene production from a eukaryotic alga and sets a foundation for further exploration of carbon conversion to this commodity chemical.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=72 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/523746v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@95085aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@575e72org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f9c2dborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@67f252_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Due to the shortage of efficient in vitro model, the viral assembly and release processes are still poorly understood. In this study, we found that ORF3, an HEV structural protein showed prion-like properties. The prion domain (PrD) of yeast prion Sup35 could be functionally replaced by HEV-ORF3 and its candidate PrD (cPrD). A single amino acid substitution in the cPrD reduced the aggregation propensity of ORF3 and blocked the function of ORF3 in enhancing the stability of microtubules in HEV-infected cells, thus blocking virion release from the infected cells and resulting in reduced HEV pathogenicity in Mongolian gerbils. These data suggest that HEV-ORF3 is a novel functional prion-like protein which assembles into a filamentous structure for virion release, supporting the hypothesis that the self-propagating properties of prion proteins are widely exploited as epigenetic information carriers in nature.",

Here we performed the second phase of a two-phase evolution experiment to investigate features of contingency. The first phase of the experiment was based on Escherichia coli clones that had evolved population at the stressful temperature of 42.2{degrees}C. The Phase 1 lines generally evolved through two adaptive pathways: mutations of rpoB, which encodes the beta subunit of RNA polymerase, or through rho, a transcriptional terminator. We hypothesized that epistatic interactions within the two pathways constrained their future adaptative potential, thus affecting patterns of historical contingency. Using 10 different E. coli Founders representing both adaptive pathways, we performed a second phase of evolution at 19.0{degrees}C to investigate how prior genetic divergence or adaptive history (rpoB vs. rho) may affect the likelihood of parallel responses and evolutionary outcomes. We found that phenotype, as measured by relative fitness, was contingent on founder genotypes and pathways. This finding extended to genotypes, because E. coli from different Phase 1 histories evolved by adaptive mutations in distinct sets of genes. Our results suggest that evolution depends critically on genetic history, likely due to idiosyncratic epistatic interactions within and between evolutionary modules.",

    "abstract": "CK2 phosphorylation of HPV16 E2 at serine 23 promotes interaction with TopBP1, and this interaction is important for E2 plasmid segregation function. Here we demonstrate that the E2-TopBP1 interaction is critical for E2 and viral genome stability during the viral life cycle. Introduction of the S23A mutation into the HPV16 genome results in a loss of E2 expression and viral genome integration during organotypic rafting. Co-culture of N/Tert-1+E2-S23A cells with J2 fibroblasts results in E2-S23A degradation via the proteasome, wild-type E2 is not degraded. TopBP1 siRNA treatment of N/Tert-1+E2-WT cells results in E2 degradation only in the presence of J2 cells demonstrating the critical role for TopBP1 in maintaining E2 stability. The CK2 inhibitor CX4945 promotes E2-WT degradation in the presence of fibroblasts as it disrupts E2-TopBP1 interaction. siRNA targeting SIRT1 rescues E2-S23A stability in N/Tert-1 cells treated with J2 fibroblasts, with an increased E2-S23A acetylation. The results demonstrate that the E2-TopBP1 interaction is critical during the viral life cycle as it prevents fibroblast stimulated SIRT1 mediated deacetylation of E2 that promotes protein degradation. This means that the E2-TopBP1 complex maintains E2 and viral genome stability and that disruption of this complex can promote viral genome integration. Finally, we demonstrate that HPV11 E2 also interacts with TopBP1 and that this interaction is critical for HPV11 E2 stability in the presence of J2 cells. Treatment of N/Tert-1+11E2-WT cells with CX4945 results in 11E2 degradation. Therefore, CK2 inhibition is a therapeutic strategy for alleviating HPV11 diseases, including juvenile respiratory papillomatosis.\n\nImportanceHuman papillomaviruses are pathogens that cause a host of diseases ranging from benign warts to cancers. There are no therapeutics available for combating these diseases that directly target viral proteins or processes, therefore we must enhance our understanding of HPV life cycles to assist with identifying novel treatments. In this report, we demonstrate that HPV16 and HPV11 E2 protein expression is dependent upon TopBP1 interaction in keratinocytes interacting with fibroblasts, which recapitulate stromal interactions in culture. The degradation of 16E2 promotes HPV16 genome integration, therefore the E2-TopBP1 interaction is critical during the viral life cycle. We demonstrate that the CK2 inhibitor CX4945 disrupts HPV11 interaction with TopBP1 and destabilizes HPV11 E2 protein in the presence of J2 fibroblasts; we propose that CX4945 could alleviate HPV11 disease burden.",

To allow a higher testing throughput than the guideline animal experiments, a developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) in vitro testing battery (DNT IVB) has been set up that includes a variety of assays, which model several key neurodevelopmental processes. Gap analyses of the DNT IVB revealed the need of a human-based assay to assess neural network formation and function (NNF). Therefore, here we established the human NNF (hNNF) assay. A co-culture comprised of human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)- derived excitatory and inhibitory neurons, as well as primary human astroglia, was differentiated for 35 days on micro-electrode arrays (MEA) and spontaneous electrical activity, together with cytotoxicity, was assessed on a weekly basis after washout of the compounds 24 h prior to measurements. In addition to the characterization of the test system, the assay was challenged with 28 compounds, mainly pesticides, identifying their DNT potential by evaluation of specific spike-, burst- and network parameters. This approach confirmed the suitability of the assay for screening environmental chemicals. Comparison of benchmark concentrations (BMC) with an NNF in vitro assay (rNNF) based on primary rat cortical cells, revealed differences in sensitivity. Together with the successful implementation of hNNF data into a postulated stressor-specific adverse outcome pathway (AOP) network associated with a plausible molecular initiating event for deltamethrin, this study suggests the hNNF assay as a useful complement to the current DNT IVB.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial cancer therapy (BCT) is a promising therapeutic for solid tumours. Salmonella enterica Typhimurium (STm) is well-studied amongst bacterial vectors due to advantages in genetic modification and metabolic adaptation. A longstanding paradox is the redundancy of T cells for treatment efficacy; instead, STm BCT depends on innate phagocytes for tumour control. Here, we used distal T cell receptor (TCR) reporter mice (Nr4a3-Tocky-Ifng-YFP) and a colorectal cancer (CRC) model to interrogate T cell activity during BCT with attenuated STm. We found that colonic TILs exhibited a variety of activation defects, including IFN-{gamma} production decoupled from TCR signalling, decreased polyfunctionality and reduced TCM formation. Modelling of T-cell-tumour interactions with a tumour organoid platform revealed an intact TCR signalosome, but paralysed metabolic reprogramming due to inhibition of the master metabolic controller, c-Myc. Restoration of c-Myc by deletion of the bacterial asparaginase ansB reinvigorated T cell activation, but at the cost of decreased metabolic control of the tumour by STm. This work shows for the first time that T cells are metabolically defective during BCT, but also that this same phenomenon is inexorably tied to intrinsic tumour suppression by the bacterial vector.",

    "abstract": "DMRT1 is the testis-determining factor in several species of vertebrates, but its involvement in mammalian testes differentiation, where SRY is the testis-determining gene, remains ambiguous. So far, DMRT1 loss of function has been described in two mammalian species and induces different phenotypes: disorders of sex development (46, XY DSD) in men and male infertility in mice. We thus abolished DMRT1 expression by CRISPR/Cas9 in a third species of mammal, the rabbit. First, we observed that gonads from XY DMRT1-/- rabbit fetuses differentiated like ovaries, highlighting that DMRT1 is involved in testis determination. In addition to SRY, DMRT1 is required in the supporting cells to increase the expression of the SOX9 gene, which heads the testicular genetic cascade. Second, we highlighted another function of DMRT1 in the germline since XX and XY DMRT1-/- ovaries did not undergo meiosis and folliculogenesis. XX DMRT1-/- adult females were sterile, showing that DMRT1 is also crucial for female fertility. To conclude, these phenotypes indicate an evolutionary continuum between non-mammalian vertebrates such as birds and non-rodent mammals. Furthermore, our data support the potential involvement of DMRT1 mutations in different human pathologies, such as 46, XY DSD as well as male and female infertility.",

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant disorder predisposing affected individuals to tumorigenesis, including benign plexiform neurofibromas; however, understanding of factors associated with tumor risk in NF1 patients is limited. Therefore, we investigated whether pregestational folic acid intake modified plexiform-like peripheral nerve sheath tumor risk in a transgenic NF1 murine model.\n\nResultsWe observed no significant differences in overall survival according to folate group. Relative to controls (180 days), median survival did not statistically differ in deficient (174 days, P=0.56) or supplemented (177 days, P=0.13) folate groups. Dietary folate intake was positively associated with RBC folate levels at weaning, (P=0.023, 0.0096, and 0.0006 for deficient vs. control, control vs. supplemented, and deficient vs. supplemented groups, respectively). Dorsal root ganglia (DRG), brachial plexi, and sciatic nerves were assessed according to folate group.

The 3 peptides exert time- and dose-dependent differential responses in osteoblasts, leading us to hypothesize that they may also differentially modulate the osteoblast transcriptome. We show that treatment of mouse calvarial osteoblasts with 1 nM of the 3 peptides for 4 h results in RNA-Seq data with PTH(1-34) regulating 367 genes, including 194 unique genes; PTHrP(1-36) regulating 117 genes, including 15 unique genes; and ABL regulating 179 genes, including 20 unique genes. There were 83 genes shared among all 3 peptides. Gene ontology analyses showed differences in Wnt signaling, cAMP-mediated signaling, bone mineralization, morphogenesis of a branching structure in biological processes; receptor ligand activity, transcription factor activity, cytokine receptor/binding activity and many other actions in molecular functions. The 3 peptides increased Vdr, Cited1 and Pde10a mRNAs in a pattern similar to Rankl, i.e., PTH(1-34) > ABL > PTHrP(1-36). mRNA abundance of other genes based on gene/pathway analyses, including Wnt4, Wnt7, Wnt11, Sfrp4, Dkk1, Kcnk10, Hdac4, Epha3, Tcf7, Crem, Fzd5, Pp2r2a, and Dvl3 showed that some genes were regulated similarly by all 3 peptides; others were not. Finally, siRNA knockdowns of SIK1/2/3 and CRTC1/2/3 in PTH(1-34)-treated cells revealed that Vdr and Wnt4 genes are regulated by SIKs and CRTCs, while others are not. Although many studies have examined PTH signaling in the osteoblast/osteocyte, ours is the first to examine the global effects of these peptides on the osteoblast transcriptome. Further delineation of which signaling events are attributable to PTH(1-34), PTHrP(1-36) or ABL exclusively and which are shared among all 3 will help improve our understanding of the effects these peptides have on the osteoblast and lead to the refinement of PTH-derived treatments for osteoporosis.",

Sex differences in immune cell activation drive obesity-mediated pathologies where males are more susceptible to obesity co-morbidities and exacerbated inflammation.

Compared to male mice, RELM levels were elevated in both control and high fat dietfed females and correlated with adipose macrophages and eosinophils. RELM-deficient females gained more weight and had pro-inflammatory macrophage accumulation and eosinophil loss, while both RELM treatment and eosinophil transfer rescued this phenotype. Single cell RNA-sequencing of the adipose stromal vascular fraction was performed and identified sex and RELM-dependent changes. Genes involved in oxygen sensing and iron homeostasis, including hemoglobin and lncRNA Gm47283, correlated with increased obesity, while eosinophil chemotaxis and response to amyloid-beta were protective. Monocyte-to-macrophage transition was also dysregulated in RELM-deficient animals. Collectively, these studies implicate a RELM-macrophage-eosinophil axis in sex-specific protection against obesity and uncover new therapeutic targets for obesity.",

We hypothesize enrichment of open chromatin in the sex where we see expression bias (OS) and closed chromatin in the opposite sex (CO). In this study of D. melanogaster and D. simulans head tissue, sex-bias in expression is associated with H3K4me3 (open mark) in males for male-biased genes and in females for female-biased genes in both species. Sex-bias in expression is also largely conserved in direction and magnitude between the two species on the X and autosomes. In male-biased orthologs, the sex-bias ratio is more divergent between species if both species have H3K27me2me3 marks in females compared to when either or neither species has H3K27me2me3 in females. H3K27me2me3 marks in females are associated with male-bias in expression on the autosomes in both species, but on the X only in D. melanogaster. In female-biased orthologs the relationship between the species for the sex-bias ratio is similar regardless of the H3K27me2me3 marks in males. Female-biased orthologs are more similar in the ratio of sex-bias than male-biased orthologs and there is an excess of male-bias in expression in orthologs that gain/lose sex-bias. There is an excess of male-bias in sex-limited expression in both species suggesting excess male-bias is due to rapid evolution between the species. The X chromosome has an enrichment in male-limited H3K4me3 in both species and an enrichment of sex-bias in expression compared to the autosomes.",

Nonetheless, serious public health concerns remain because insecticide-resistant vector populations continue to spread globally.

Contact-based insecticides are absorbed through the insect cuticle, which is comprised mainly of chitin polysaccharides, cuticular proteins, hydrocarbons, and phenolic biopolymers sclerotin and melanin. Cuticle interface alterations can slow or prevent insecticide penetration in a phenomenon referred to as cuticular resistance. Cuticular resistance characterization of the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, is lacking. In the current study, we utilized solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to gain insights into the cuticle composition of congenic cytochrome P450 monooxygenase insecticide resistant and susceptible Ae. aegypti. No differences in cuticular hydrocarbon content or phenolic biopolymer deposition were found. In contrast, we observed cuticle thickness of insecticide resistant Ae. aegypti increased over time and exhibited higher polysaccharide abundance. Moreover, we found these local cuticular changes correlated with global metabolic differences in the whole mosquito, suggesting the existence of novel cuticular resistance mechanisms in this major disease vector.",

    "abstract": "ExoY virulence factors are members of a family of bacterial nucleotidyl cyclases (NCs) that are activated by specific eukaryotic cofactors and overproduce cyclic purine and pyrimidine nucleotides in host cells. ExoYs are actin-activated NC toxins. Here, we investigate the Vibrio nigripulchritudo Multifunctional-Autoprocessing Repeats-in-ToXin (MARTX) ExoY effector domain (Vn-ExoY) as a model for ExoY-type members that interact with monomeric (G-actin) rather than filamentous (F-actin) actin. Vn-ExoY binds with only modest affinity to free or profilin-bound G-actin, but can capture the G-actin:profilin complex for its own activation by preventing the spontaneous or VASP- or formin-mediated assembly of G-actin:profilin at the barbed ends of F-actin in vitro. This may prolong the lifetime of the cofactor-bound state of Vn-ExoY at sites of active actin cytoskeleton remodelling. A series of high-resolution crystal structures of nucleotide-free, 3-deoxy-ATP- or 3-deoxy-CTP-bound Vn-ExoY, activated by free or profilin-bound G-actin-ATP/-ADP show that the cofactor only partially stabilises the nucleotide-binding pocket (NBP) of all NC toxins. Substrate binding promotes a large, previously-unidentified, closure of their NBP. This confines catalytically important residues of the NC toxins and metal cofactors around the substrate and promotes the recruitment of two metal ions to tightly coordinate the triphosphate moiety of purine or pyrimidine nucleotide substrates. Residues that play an important role in both the purinyl and pyrimidinyl cyclase activity of NC toxins are validated in Vn-ExoY and the distantly-related ExoY from Pseudomonas aeruginosa that interact with F-actin. The data conclusively demonstrate that NC toxins employ a similar two-metal-ion mechanism for catalysing the cyclisation reaction of nucleotides of different sizes. These structural insights into the dynamics of the actin-binding interface of actin-activated ExoYs and the multi-step activation of all NC toxins open up new perspectives for identifying ways to specifically inhibit these bacterial NC enzymes.\n\nAuthor SummaryExoY toxins belong to a family of bacterial nucleotidyl cyclases (NCs) that are injected into eukaryotic cells and bind to specific host cofactors to trigger their toxic, potent NC enzymatic activity. They alter host cell signalling by overproducing purine and pyrimidine cyclic nucleotides, which act as canonical and non-canonical intracellular messengers, respectively. The molecular and mechanistic details underlying the activation and catalytic specificities of NC toxins are only partially understood. Here, we investigate ExoY-type members that are unable to interact with actin filaments for their activation. We show in vitro that such ExoYs capture the actin:profilin complex for activation by disrupting its association with the most dynamic ends of actin filaments. We have captured several structural snapshots along the Vn-ExoY activation pathway by G-actin or G-actin-profilin without or with purine or pyrimidine nucleotide analogues. Our structural data reveal unprecedented mechanistic details of how the active site of all NC toxins is sequentially remodelled by cofactor and substrate binding, how they can accommodate nucleotides of different sizes as substrates, and elucidate important features of their catalytic reaction. These structural insights into the multi-step activation of NC toxins provide new perspectives for identifying ways to specifically inhibit this class of NC enzymes.",

    "abstract": "The world health organization considers antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to be a critical global public health problem. Conventional culture-based methods that are used to detect and identify bacterial infection are slow. Thus, there is a growing need for the development of robust, cost-effective, and fast diagnostic solutions for the identification of pathogens. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) can be used to identify target analytes with sensitivity down to the single-molecule level. Here, we developed a SERS chip by optimizing the entire fabrication pipeline of the metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) method. The MACE approach offers a large-scale, densely packed silver (Ag) nanostructure on top of silicon nanowires (Si-NWs) with a large aspect ratio that significantly enhances the Raman signal due to localised surface plasmonic enhancement. The optimised SERS chips exhibited sensitivity down to 10-12 M concentration of R6G molecule and detected reproducible Raman spectra of bacteria down to a concentration of 100 colony forming units (CFU)/ml, which is a thousand times lower than the clinical threshold of bacterial infections like UTI (105 CFU/ml). A Siamese neural network model was used to classify SERS Raman spectra from bacteria specimens. The trained model identified 12 different bacterial species, including those which are causative agents for tuberculosis and urinary tract infection (UTI). Next, the SERS chips and another Siamese neural network model were used to differentiate antibiotic-resistant strains from susceptible strains of E. coli. The enhancement offered by SERS chip enabled acquisitions of Raman spectra of bacteria directly in the synthetic urine by spiking the sample with only 103 CFU/ml E. coli.

    "abstract": "Gliomas are among the most invasive and chemo-resistant cancers, making them challenging to treat. Chronic inflammation is one of the key drivers of glioma progression as it promotes the aberrant activation of inflammatory pathways such as NF-{kappa}B signalling which drives cancer cell invasion, angiogenesis and tissue remodelling. NF-{kappa}B factors typically dimerize with its own family members, but emerging evidence of their promiscuous interactions with other oncogenic factors have been reported to activate the transcription of new target genes and function. Here, we show that non-canonical NF-{kappa}B activation directly regulates p52 at the ETS1 promoter to activate its expression. This in turn impacts the genomic and transcriptional landscape of ETS1 in a glioma-specific manner. We further show that enhanced non-canonical NF-{kappa}B signalling promotes the co-localization of p52 and ETS1, resulting in the transcriptional activation of non-{kappa}B and/or non-ETS glioma-promoting genes. We conclude that p52-induced ETS1 overexpression in glioma cells remodels the genome-wide regulatory network of p52 and ETS1 to transcriptionally drive cancer progression.",

    "abstract": "Correctly identifying the meaning of a stimulus requires activating the appropriate semantic representation among many alternatives. One way to reduce this uncertainty is to differentiate semantic representations from each other, thereby expanding the semantic space. In four experiments, we test this semantic-expansion hypothesis, finding that uncertainty averse individuals exhibit increasingly differentiated and separated semantic representations. This effect is mirrored at the neural level, where uncertainty aversion predicts greater distances between activity patterns in the left inferior frontal gyrus when reading words, and enhanced sensitivity to the semantic ambiguity of these words in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Two direct tests of the behavioral consequences of semantic-expansion further reveal that uncertainty averse individuals exhibit reduced semantic interference and poorer generalization. Together, these findings demonstrate that the internal structure of our semantic representations is shaped in a principled manner: aversion to uncertainty acts as an organizing principle to make the world more identifiable.",

    "abstract": "The Gardnerella genus, now made up of more than 13 species, is associated with the polymicrobial disorder bacterial vaginosis (BV). However, the details of BV pathogenesis are poorly defined, and the contributions made by individual species are largely unknown. We report here that colony phenotypes characterized by size (large and small) and opacity (opaque and translucent) are phase variable and are conserved among all tested Gardnerella strains, representing at least ten different species. With the hypothesis that these different variants could be an important missing piece to the enigma of how BV develops in vivo, we characterized their differences. Beyond increased colony size, large colony variants (Lg) showed reduced vaginolysin secretion and faster growth rate relative to small colony variants (Sm). The ability to inhibit growth of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and commensal lactobacillus species varied by strain and in some instances differed between variants. Proteomics analyses indicate that 127-173 proteins are differentially expressed between variants. Further, whole genome sequencing analyses revealed an abundance of genes associated with variable poly-guanine tracts, implicating slipped strand mispairing in Gardnerella phase variation, and illuminating the potential for previously unrecognized variability within clonal populations. Collectively, these results suggest that colony variants may be primed to serve different roles in BV pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Biological systems are inherently noisy; however, they produce highly stereotyped tissue morphology. Drosophila pupal wings show a highly stereotypic folding through uniform expansion and subsequent buckling of wing epithelium within a surrounding cuticle sac. The folding pattern produced by buckling is generally stochastic; it is thus unclear how buckling leads to stereotypic tissue folding of the wings. We found that the extracellular matrix (ECM) protein, Dumpy, guides the position and direction of buckling-induced folds. Dumpy anchors the wing epithelium to the overlying cuticle at specific tissue positions. Tissue-wide alterations of Dumpy deposition and degradation yielded different buckling patterns. In summary, we propose that spatio-temporal ECM remodeling shapes stereotyped tissue folding through dynamic interactions between the epithelium and its external structures.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryRemodeling of extracellular matrix protein, Dumpy, guides epithelial tissue folding during Drosophila wing development.",

    "abstract": "Understanding phenotype-to-genotype relationships is a grand challenge of 21st century biology with translational implications. The recently proposed \"omnigenic\" model postulates that effects of genetic variation on traits are mediated by core-genes and -proteins whose activities mechanistically influence the phenotype, whereas peripheral genes encode a regulatory network that indirectly affects phenotypes via core gene products. We have developed a positive-unlabeled graph representation-learning ensemble-approach to predict core genes for diverse diseases using Mendelian disorder genes for training. Employing mouse knockout phenotypes for external validation, we demonstrate that our most confident predictions validate at rates on par with the Mendelian disorder genes, and all candidates exhibit core-gene properties like transcriptional deregulation in diseases and loss-of-function intolerance. Predicted candidates are enriched for drug targets and druggable proteins and, in contrast to Mendelian disorder genes, also for druggable but yet untargeted gene products. Model interpretation suggests key molecular mechanisms and physical interactions for core gene predictions. Our results demonstrate the potential of graph representation learning and pave the way for studying core gene properties and future drug development.",

    "abstract": "Recent theories of cortical organisation maintain that important features of brain function emerge through the spatial arrangement of regions of cortex. For example, areas of association cortex are located in regions of cortex furthest from sensory and motor cortex. Association cortex is also  interdigitated since adjacent regions can have relatively different patterns of functional connectivity. It is assumed that topographic properties such as distance between cortical regions constrain their functions. For example, large distances between association and sensory and motor systems may enable these areas of cortex to maintain differentiable neural patterns, while an interdigitated organisation may enable association cortex to contain many functional systems in a relatively compact space. We currently lack a formal understanding of how spatial organisation impacts brain function, limiting the ability to leverage cortical topography to facilitate better interpretations of a regions function. Here we use variograms, a quantification of spatial autocorrelation, to develop a cortex-wide profile of how functional similarity changes as a function of the distance between regions. We establish that function changes gradually within sensory and motor cortex as the distance between regions increases, while in association cortex function changes rapidly over shorter distances. Subsequent analysis suggests these differential classes of spatial dependency are related to variation in intracortical myelin between sensory motor and association cortex. Our study suggests primary and association cortex are differentiated by the degree to which function varies over space, emphasising the need to formally account for spatial properties when estimating a systems contribution to cognition and behaviour.\n\nSignificance statementThe spatial arrangements of regions in the human brain are hypothesised to underpin important features of a brain regions function. Currently, however, we lack a formal understanding of how topography shapes brain function, limiting our ability to leverage topographical perspectives to inform better theories of brain function. Here we use a formal mathematical approach to establish that in regions of association cortex function varies across the cortex more rapidly than in sensory and motor cortex, a phenomenon linked to levels of intracortical myelin. This result highlights how topographical features distinguish between cortical regions with different functional profiles and provides a formal account of how spatial differences support different features of brain function.",
