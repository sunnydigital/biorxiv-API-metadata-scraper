    "abstract": "Drug efflux systems have recently been recognized as an important mechanism of multidrug resistance in bacteria. Here, we described the identification and characterization of a novel chromosomally encoded multidrug efflux pump (SA09310) in Staphylococcus aureus. SA09310 is a 43-kDa protein with 12 transmembrane helices. The conserved amino acid sequence motifs of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) were identified in the protein SA09310, which indicated SA09310 belonged to MFS transporters. Expression of the sa09310 gene was induced by different types of antibiotics, including aminoglycoside, tetracycline, macrolides, and chloramphenicol. The sa09310 gene knockout mutant ({Delta}sa09310) was constructed, and its susceptibility to 30 different antibiotics was evaluated. Mutant{bigtriangleup} sa09310 exhibited increased sensitivity to tetracycline and doxycycline, with 64-fold and 8-fold decreased MICs, respectively. The mechanism of SA09310 mediating tetracycline resistance was demonstrated by its ability to extrude intracellular tetracycline from within the cells into the environment. The efflux activity of SA09310 was further confirmed by EtBr accumulation and efflux assays. In addition, the efflux activity of SA09310 was observed to be blocked by the known efflux pump inhibitor carbonyl cyanide-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), which provided direct evidence that suggested the H+-dependent activity of SA09310 efflux pump. The conservation of SA09310 homologs in Staphylococcus indicated the universal function of these SA09310-like protein clusters. In conclusion, the function-unknown protein SA09310 has been identified and characterized as a tetracycline efflux pump, thereby mediating tetracycline resistance in S. aureus.",

    "abstract": "Mitosis is an essential process in which the duplicated genome is segregated equally into two daughter cells. CTCF has been reported to be present in mitosis but its importance for mitotic fidelity remains to be determined. To evaluate the importance of CTCF in mitosis, we tracked mitotic behaviors in wild type and two different CTCF CRISPR-based genetic knockdowns. We find that knockdown of CTCF results in prolonged mitoses and failed anaphase segregation via time lapse imaging of SiR-DNA. CTCF knockdown did not alter cell cycling or the mitotic checkpoint, which was activated upon nocodazole treatment. Immunofluorescence imaging of the mitotic spindle in CTCF knockdowns revealed disorganization via tri/tetrapolar spindles and chromosomes behind the spindle pole. Imaging of interphase nuclei showed that nuclear size increased drastically, consistent with failure to divide the duplicated genome in anaphase. Population measurements of nuclear shape in CTCF knockdowns do not display decreased circularity or increased nuclear blebbing relative to wild type. However, failed mitoses do display abnormal nuclear morphologies relative to successful mitoses, suggesting population images do not capture individual behaviors. Thus, CTCF is important for both proper metaphase organization and anaphase segregation which impacts the size and shape of the interphase nucleus.",

    "abstract": "For centuries, echinoderms, a marine-invertebrate phylum, have fascinated scientists for their developmental and postembryonic phenomen. Experimentation on their eggs and embryos in particular have contributed foundation scientific advances. However, powerful molecular genetic studies are restricted to embryonic developmental stages which are amenable to genetic perturbation by microinjection of reagents into the zygotes. This represents a significant bottleneck to the study of postembryonic processes in where the earliest function of a gene must remain intact. We therefore sought to establish a spatio-temporal turnable gene editing tool for these species. Here, using the sea star Patiria miniata as a model we introduce a chemically inducible, Tet-ON, gene expression system. Pairing this Tet-ON system with CRISPR-mediated gene alteration technology we show as a proof-of-principle demonstration an inducible gene editing in the sea star transgenic cell populations for the first time in echinoderm biology. The approach we show here can be adapted for use in other species of echinoderms and will also extend experimental possibilities tremendously.",

It is also present in non-bilaterian metazoans, such as cnidarians, where it acts as a component of an axial patterning system. In this study, we present a phylogenetic analysis of Brachyury genes within phylum Cnidaria, investigate differential expression and address a functional framework of Brachyury paralogs in hydrozoan Dynamena pumila.\n\nOur analysis indicates two duplication events of Brachyury in the cnidarian lineage: in the common ancestor of the Medusozoa clade and at the base of the class Hydrozoa. We designate result of the first step as Brachyury2 and of the second as Brachyury3.\n\nBrachyury1 and 2 display a conservative expression pattern marking the oral pole of the body axis in D. pumila. On the contrary, Brachyury3 expression was detected in scattered presumably nerve cells of the D. pumila larva. Pharmacological modulations indicated that Brachyury3 is not under regulation of cWnt signalling in contrast to the other two Brachyury genes. Divergence in expression patterns and regulation suggest neofunctionalization of Brachyury3 in hydrozoans.",

    "abstract": "During early animal evolution, the emergence of axially-polarized segments was central to the diversification of complex bilaterian body plans. Nevertheless, precisely how and when segment polarity pathways arose remains obscure. Here we demonstrate the molecular basis for segment polarization in developing larvae of the pre-bilaterian sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. Utilizing spatial transcriptomics, we first constructed a 3-D gene expression atlas of developing larval segments. Capitalizing on accurate in silico predictions, we identified Lbx and Uncx, conserved homeodomain-containing genes that occupy opposing subsegmental domains under the control of both BMP signaling and the Hox-Gbx cascade. Functionally, Lbx mutagenesis eliminated all molecular evidence of segment polarization at larval stage and caused an aberrant mirror-symmetric pattern of retractor muscles in primary polyps. These results demonstrate the molecular basis for segment polarity in a pre-bilaterian animal, suggesting that polarized metameric structures were present in the Cnidaria-Bilateria common ancestor over 600 million years ago.\n\nHighlightsO_LINematostella endomesodermal tissue forms metameric segments and displays a transcriptomic profile similar to that observed in bilaterian mesoderm\nC_LIO_LIConstruction of a comprehensive 3-D gene expression atlas enables systematic dissection of segmental identity in endomesoderm\nC_LIO_LILbx and Uncx, two conserved homeobox-containing genes, establish segment polarity in Nematostella\nC_LIO_LIThe Cnidarian-Bilaterian common ancestor likely possessed the genetic toolkit to generate polarized metameric structures\nC_LI",

By combining analysis of rare coding variants from the UK Biobank and genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout and activation screening, we have substantially improved the identification of genes whose disruption alters serum LDL-C levels. We identify 21 genes in which rare coding variants significantly alter LDL-C levels at least partially through altered LDL-C uptake. We use co-essentiality-based gene module analysis to show that dysfunction of the RAB10 vesicle transport pathway leads to hypercholesterolemia in humans and mice by impairing surface LDL receptor levels. Further, we demonstrate that loss of function of OTX2 leads to robust reduction in serum LDL-C levels in mice and humans by increasing cellular LDL-C uptake. Altogether, we present an integrated approach that improves our understanding of genetic regulators of LDL-C levels and provides a roadmap for further efforts to dissect complex human disease genetics.",

    "abstract": "Detection of genome-wide genetic variation is one of the primary goals in bovine genomics. Genomes of several cattle breeds have been sequenced so far to understand the genetic variation associated with important phenotypes. Red Chittagong Cattle (RCC) is a locally adopted and disease-resistant indicine cattle breed in Bangladesh. In this study, we describe the first genome sequence of the RCC breed and in silico analyses of identified functional variants. Deep sequencing of a RCC bull genome on the NanoBall sequencing platform generated approximately 110 Gb paired-end data, resulting in 31X of genome coverage. Quality filtering retained 360,711,803 paired-end reads. Of the filtered reads, 99.8% were mapped to the bovine reference genome (ARSUCD1.2). A total of 17. 8 million Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 2.1 insertions and deletions (INDELs) were identified in the RCC genome. Ts/Tv ratio was computed and found to be 2.21. In total, 332 4621 variants were novel compared with dbSNP data (NCBI dbSNP bovine build 150). Functional annotation identified 54961 SNVs exonic regions, 63.75% of which were synonymous, whereas 30.42% were non-synonymous changes. The percentage of coding INDELs was 0.25% (Frameshift deletion 0.19% and Frameshift insertion 0.06%). We identified 120 variants in 26 candidates for five diseases-foot and mouth disease (FMD), Mastitis, Parasite, para-tuberculosis, and tick. Of the 120 variants, 50 were non-synonymous / frameshift (NS/FS), while 70 were synonymous/non-frameshift (SS/NFS). The identified catalog of genomic variants in RCC may establish a paradigm for cattle research in Bangladesh by filling the void and providing a database for genome-wide variation for future functional studies in RCC.",

Pseudoreplication - cells from a same subject are non-independent observations - is thought to be the major cause which motivates the use of the pseudobulk. In this work, we argue that distributional misspecification can be another, if not primary, cause of the inflated type 1 error in scRNA-seq DEG. We show that the robust sandwich estimator for distributionally misspecified maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) produces calibrated type 1 error rate. Using real data, we show that the robust method performs surprisingly well, providing both controlled type 1 error and high statistical power, and is superior to many other methods that explicitly account only for pseudoreplication. Since our suggested solution is already available in existing software, it can be immediately adapted to scRNA-seq analysis ecosystems.",

The zinc-binding motif (ZnFn) of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of PrimPol is required for DNA primase activity but the mechanism is not clear. In this work, we biochemically demonstrate that PrimPol initiates de novo DNA synthesis in cis-orientation, when the N-terminal catalytic domain (NTD) and the CTD of one molecule take part in catalysis. The modeling studies revealed that PrimPol uses a similar mode of initiating NTP coordination as the human primase. The ZnFn motif residue Arg417 is required for binding the 5-triphosphate group that stabilizes the PrimPol complex with a DNA template-primer. We found that PrimPol is able to efficiently initiate DNA synthesis in the absence of the link between the two domains. The ability of the NTD alone to prime DNA synthesis and a regulatory role of the RPA-binding motif in the modulation of PrimPol binding to DNA are also demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "Oxygen transfer from blood vessels to cortical brain tissue is representative of a class of problems with mixed-domain character. Large-scale efficient computation of tissue oxygen concentration is dependent on the manner in which the tubular network of blood vessels is coupled to the tissue mesh. Models which explicitly resolve the interface between the tissue and vasculature with a contiguous mesh are prohibitively expensive for very dense cerebral microvasculature. We propose a mixed-domain mesh-free technique whereby a vascular anatomical network (VAN) represented as a thin directed graph serves for convection of blood oxygen, and the surrounding extravascular tissue is represented as a Cartesian grid of 3D voxels throughout which oxygen is transported by diffusion. We split the network and tissue meshes by the Schur complement method of domain decomposition to obtain a reduced set of system equations for the tissue oxygen concentration. The use of a Cartesian grid allows the corresponding matrix equation to be solved approximately with a fast Fourier transform based Poisson solver, which serves as an effective preconditioner for Krylov subspace iteration. The performance of this method enables the steady state simulation of cortical oxygen perfusion for anatomically accurate vascular networks down to single micron resolution without the need for supercomputers.\n\nPractitioner PointsO_LIWe present a novel mixed-domain framework for efficiently modeling O2 extraction kinetics in the brain.\nC_LIO_LIModel equations are generated by graph-theoretic methods for mixed domains.\nC_LIO_LIDual mesh domain decomposition with FFT preconditioning yields very fast simulation times for extremely high spatial resolution.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "While rates of recombination events across the genome (genetic maps) are fundamental to genetic research, the majority of current studies only use one standard map. There is evidence suggesting population differences in genetic maps, and thus estimating population-specific maps are of interest. While the recent availability of biobank-scale data offers such opportunities, current methods are not efficient at leveraging very large sample sizes. The most accurate methods are still linkage-disequilibrium (LD)-based methods that are only tractable for a few hundred samples. In this work, we propose a fast and memory-efficient method for estimating genetic maps from population genotyping data. Our method, FastRecomb, leverages the efficient positional Burrows-Wheeler transform (PBWT) data structure for counting IBD segment boundaries as potential recombination events. We used PBWT blocks to avoid redundant counting of pairwise matches. Moreover, we used a panel smoothing technique to reduce the noise from errors and recent mutations. Using simulation, we found that FastRecomb achieves state-of-the-art performance at 10k resolution, in terms of correlation coefficients between the estimated map and the ground truth. This is mainly due to the fact that FastRecomb can effectively take advantage of large panels comprising more than hundreds of thousands of haplotypes. At the same time, other methods lack the efficiency to handle such data. We believe further refinement of FastRecomb would deliver more accurate genetic maps for the genetics community.",

    "abstract": "The breast cancer mortality rate is high in developing countries as the early detection of cancer is deficient in patients. The identification of the genes that drive cancer is one of the major approaches in the early detection of breast cancer. Several computational tools have been developed to predict the cancer driver genes. However, there is no gold-standard method for identifying breast cancer driver genes. Therefore, this study aims to develop a model to predict high-confidence breast cancer diver genes using already-developed computational tools and already-produced breast cancer data. Primary breast cancer data were retrieved from the Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA). Here we use twenty-seven different gene prediction tools that calculate each genes effect and variant in the primary gene dataset. The primary dataset feeds as the input for each tool. The results retrieved from each tool are recorded as the secondary dataset. The latest breast cancer driver gene set was retrieved from DriverDBv3 and included as the target attribute. Training and testing subsets were selected using k-fold cross-validation from the secondary dataset. Attributes from the secondary dataset were ranked according to their correlation with breast cancer driver genes. The ranked data were trained using different supervised machine-learning algorithms. The attributes and the learning algorithm which produced the highest classification accuracy were selected to build the new model, BReast cancer Driver (BRDriver). The new model BRDriver achieved 0.999 area under the curve and 0.999 classification accuracy on breast invasive carcinoma data. TP53 was the most predicted breast cancer drive gene (n=246) predicted by BRDriver. Interestingly, our BRDriver model predicted CDKN2A and NFE2L2 genes as new breast cancer driver genes. Further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to determine whether these genes are indeed cancer-driver genes. Many computational tools developed to identify the cancer driver genes and variants. A few methodologies were developed to combine these tools and increase efficiency for detecting breast cancer driver genes. Our BRDriver overcomes the difficulties and produces high-confidence breast cancer driver genes.",

    "abstract": "The cardiac cycle is a tightly regulated process wherein the heart generates force to pump blood to the body during systole and then relaxes during diastole. Disruption of this finely tuned cycle can lead to a range of diseases including cardiomyopathies and heart failure. Cardiac contraction is driven by the molecular motor myosin, which pulls regulated thin filaments in a calcium-dependent manner. In some muscle and non-muscle myosins, regulatory proteins on actin tune the kinetics, mechanics, and load dependence of the myosin working stroke; however, it is not well understood whether or how thin filament regulatory proteins tune the mechanics of the cardiac myosin motor. To address this critical gap in knowledge, we used single-molecule techniques to measure the kinetics and mechanics of the substeps of the cardiac myosin working stroke in the presence and absence of thin filament regulatory proteins. We found that regulatory proteins gate the calcium-dependent interactions between myosin and the thin filament.

    "abstract": "The cardiac cycle is a tightly regulated process wherein the heart generates force to pump blood to the body during systole and then relaxes during diastole. Disruption of this finely tuned cycle can lead to a range of diseases including cardiomyopathies and heart failure. Cardiac contraction is driven by the molecular motor myosin, which pulls regulated thin filaments in a calcium-dependent manner. In some muscle and non-muscle myosins, regulatory proteins on actin tune the kinetics, mechanics, and load dependence of the myosin working stroke; however, it is not well understood whether or how thin filament regulatory proteins tune the mechanics of the cardiac myosin motor. To address this critical gap in knowledge, we used single-molecule techniques to measure the kinetics and mechanics of the substeps of the cardiac myosin working stroke in the presence and absence of thin filament regulatory proteins. We found that regulatory proteins gate the calcium-dependent interactions between myosin and the thin filament. At physiologically relevant ATP concentrations, cardiac myosins mechanics and unloaded kinetics are not affected by thin filament regulatory proteins.

    "abstract": "Iron-sulfur clusters are inorganic cofactors found in many proteins involved in fundamental biological processes including DNA processing. The prokaryotic DNA repair enzyme PhrB, a member of the protein family of cryptochromes and photolyases, carries a four-iron-four-sulfur cluster [4Fe4S] in addition to the catalytic cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and a second pigment 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine (DMRL). The light-induced redox reactions of this multi-cofactor protein complex were recently shown as two interdependent photoreductions of FAD and DMRL mediated by the [4Fe4S] cluster functioning as an electron cache to hold a fine balance of electrons. Here, we apply the more traditional temperature-scan cryo-trapping technique in protein crystallography and the newly developed technology of in situ serial Laue diffraction at room temperature. These diffraction methods in dynamic crystallography enable us to capture strong signals of electron density changes in the [4Fe4S] cluster that depict quantized electronic movements. The mixed valence layers of the [4Fe4S] cluster due to spin coupling and their dynamic responses to light illumination are observed directly in our difference maps between its redox states. These direct observations of the quantum effects in a protein bound iron-sulfur cluster have thus opened a window into the mechanistic understanding of metal clusters in biological systems.",

    "abstract": "Inactivating mutations in ATRX characterize large subgroups of malignant gliomas in adults and children. ATRX deficiency in glioma induces widespread chromatin remodeling, driving transcriptional shifts and oncogenic phenotypes. Effective strategies to therapeutically target these broad epigenomic sequelae remain undeveloped. We utilized integrated mulit-omics and the Broad Institute Connectivity Map (CMAP) to identify drug candidates that could potentially revert ATRX-deficient transcriptional changes. We then employed disease-relevant experimental models to evaluate functional phenotypes, coupling these studies with epigenomic profiling to elucidate molecular mechanim(s). CMAP analysis and transcriptional/epigenomic profiling implicated the Class III HDAC Sirtuin2 (Sirt2) as a central mediator of ATRX-deficient cellular phenotypes and a driver of unfavorable prognosis in ATRX-deficient glioma. Sirt2 inhibitors reverted Atrx-deficient transcriptional signatures in murine neuroprogenitor cells (mNPCs) and impaired cell migration in Atrx/ATRX-deficient mNPCs and human glioma stem cells (GSCs). While effects on cellular proliferation in these contexts were more modest, markers of senescence significantly increased, suggesting that Sirt2 inhibition promotes terminal differentiation in ATRX-deficient glioma. These phenotypic effects were accompanied by genome-wide shifts in enhancer-associated H3K27ac and H4K16ac marks, with the latter in particular demonstrating compelling transcriptional links to Sirt2-dependent phenotypic reversals. Motif analysis of these data identified the transcription factor KLF16 as a mediator of phenotype reversal in Atrx-deficient cells upon Sirt2 inhibition. Finally, Sirt2 inhibition impaired growth and increased senescence in ATRX-deficient GSCs in vivo. Our findings indicate that Sirt2 inhibition selectively targets ATRX-deficient gliomas through global chromatin remodeling, while demonstrating more broadly a viable approach to combat complex epigenetic rewiring in cancer.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=167 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/523324v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (39K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d1c7cborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19421fcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@433aaaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c07f72_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG One Sentence SummaryOur study demonstrates that SIRT2 inhibition promotes senescence in ATRX-deficient glioma model systems through global epigenomic remodeling, impacting key downstream transcriptional profiles.",

Thus these proteins have potential application in the development of a natural blue coloured food dye using microbial cell factories. However, F3'5'Hs are membrane proteins that require a redox partner, NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR). The aim of the research was to identify F3'5'H sequences from Vaccinium species plants and express the respective proteins in yeast to test their potential in biotechnological production of precursors of anthocyanins. In this study, novel coding DNA sequences of F3'5'Hs from Vaccinium myrtillus and Vaccinium uliginosum, and two CPRs from V. myrtillus were identified and characterised. The newly obtained proteins and F3'5'H from Vaccinium corymbosum and CPR from Helianthus annuus were expressed in Pichia pastoris. Addition of DMSO into the culture medium increased production of F3'5'Hs and CPRs. A truncated form of V. corymbosum F3'5'H, that lacked the predicted first N-terminal alpha helix, expressed at higher level compared to the full-length protein. Vaccinium F3'5'Hs were combined with different CPRs and substrates to identify which CPR acts as a redox partner for F3'5'Hs and which substrates are preferred. Unfortunately, only substrates but not the products could be detected, indicating that the recombinant F3'5'Hs were inactive. Therefore, despite progress in protein expression, P. pastoris was not a suitable host for producing Vaccinium F3'5'Hs.",

    "abstract": "Immunotherapeutic cytokines can activate immune cells against cancers and chronic infections. N-803 is an IL-15 superagonist that expands CD8+ T cells and increases their cytotoxicity. N-803 also temporarily reduced viral load in a limited subset of non-human primates infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), a model of HIV. However, viral suppression has not been observed in all SIV cohorts and may depend on pre-treatment viral load and the corresponding effects on CD8+ T cells. Starting from an existing mechanistic mathematical model of N-803 immunotherapy of SIV, we develop a model that includes activation of SIV-specific and non-SIV-specific CD8+ T cells by antigen, inflammation, and N-803. Also included is a regulatory counter-response that inhibits CD8+ T cell proliferation and function, representing the effects of immune checkpoint molecules and immunosuppressive cells. We simultaneously calibrate the model to two separate SIV cohorts. The first cohort had low viral loads prior to treatment ({approx}3-4 log viral RNA copy equivalents (CEQ)/mL), and N-803 treatment transiently suppressed viral load. The second had higher pre-treatment viral loads ({approx}5-7 log CEQ/mL) and saw no consistent virus suppression with N-803. The mathematical model can replicate the viral and CD8+ T cell dynamics of both cohorts based on different pre-treatment viral loads and different levels of regulatory inhibition of CD8+ T cells due to those viral loads (i.e. initial conditions of model). Our predictions are validated by additional data from these and other SIV cohorts. While both cohorts had high numbers of activated SIV-specific CD8+ T cells in simulations, viral suppression was precluded in the high viral load cohort due to elevated inhibition of cytotoxicity. Thus, we mathematically demonstrate how the pre-treatment viral load can influence immunotherapeutic efficacy, highlighting the in vivo conditions and combination therapies that could maximize efficacy and improve treatment outcomes.\n\nAuthor SummaryImmunotherapy bolsters and redirects the immune system to fight chronic infections and cancers. However, the effectiveness of some immunotherapies may depend on the level of pre-treatment inflammation and the corresponding presence of regulatory cells and immune checkpoint molecules that normally function to prevent immune overreaction. Here, we consider two previously published cohorts of macaques who were given the immunotherapeutic N-803 to treat Simian Immunodeficiency Virus, an analog of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). One cohort had low viral loads before treatment, and N-803 temporarily suppressed viral loads. The second cohort had high viral loads that did not consistently decrease with N-803 treatment. In this work, we demonstrate with a mathematical model how these two distinct outcomes can arise due only to the different viral loads and the corresponding immune activation and regulatory response. In the model, we find that the key limiting factor is the direct inhibition of the cytotoxic action of immune cells by immune checkpoint molecules. This model indicates that simultaneous blockade of immune checkpoint molecules may be necessary for effective application of N-803 for the treatment of HIV. This and similar models can inform the design of such combination therapies for cancer and chronic infection.",

    "abstract": "Peptide vaccines present a safe and cost-efficient alternative to traditional vaccines. Their efficacy depends on the peptides included in the vaccine and the ability of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules to bind and present these peptides. Due to the high diversity of MHC alleles, their diverging peptide binding specificities, and physical constraints on the maximum length of peptide vaccine constructs, choosing a set of peptides that effectively achieve immunization across a large proportion of the population is challenging.\n\nHere, we present HOGVAX, a combinatorial optimization approach to select peptides that maximize population coverage. The key idea behind HOGVAX is to exploit overlaps between peptide sequences to include a large number of peptides in limited space and thereby also cover rare MHC alleles. We formalize the vaccine design task as a theoretical problem, which we call the Maximum Scoring k-Superstring Problem (MSKS). We show that MSKS is NP-hard, reformulate it into a graph problem using the hierarchical overlap graph (HOG), and present a haplotype-aware variant of MSKS to take linkage disequilibrium between MHC loci into account. We give an integer linear programming formulation for the graph problem and provide an open source implementation.\n\nWe demonstrate on a SARS-CoV-2 case study that HOGVAX-designed vaccine formulations contain significantly more peptides than vaccine sequences built from concatenated peptides. We predict over 98% population coverage and high numbers of per-individual presented peptides, leading to robust immunity against new pathogens or viral variants.",

The broad multilevel changes were linked to, among others, (i) the remodelling of the plastidial membrane, where the synthesis and storage of ketocarotenoids occurs, (ii) the recruiting of core metabolic pathways for the generation of metabolite precursors and energy, and (iii) redox control.

In this work, we discuss various ways of encoding missing data and integrate them into the training and inference process. We implement the approaches in the BayesFlow methodology, an amortized estimation framework based on invertible neural networks, and evaluate their performance on multiple test problems. We find that an approach in which the data vector is augmented with binary indicators of presence or absence of values performs the most robustly. Accordingly, we demonstrate that amortized simulation-based inference approaches are applicable even with missing data, and we provide a guideline for their handling, which is relevant for a broad spectrum of applications.",

There are examples in which the formation of color patterns is controlled by a morphogen. The extracellular distribution of a morphogen can be plastic with temperature change. Whether alteration of morphogen distribution with temperature change produces thermal plasticity in color patterns has not been studied. To address this question, polka-dotted wing spots of Drosophila guttifera, whose inducer is wingless morphogen, can be a suitable model system. In this study, we reared D. guttifera at different temperatures to test whether wing spots show thermal plasticity. We found that wing size becomes larger and spot size adjusted with wing size becomes smaller at lower temperatures. We also changed the rearing temperature in the middle of the pupal period and found that the most sensitive developmental period for wing size and spot size is different. The results suggest that developmental mechanisms for the thermal plasticity of wing size and spot size are different. We also found that the most sensitive stage for spot size was part of the pupal period including stages at which wingless is expressed in the polka-dotted pattern. Therefore, it is suggested that temperature change might affect the process of specifying spot areas by Wingless in the extracellular region.",

    "abstract": "Even transient periods of developmental hearing loss during the developmental critical period have been linked to long-lasting deficits in auditory perception, including temporal and spectral processing, which correlate with speech perception and educational attainment. In gerbils, hearing loss-induced perceptual deficits are correlated with a reduction of both ionotropic GABAA and metabotropic GABAB receptor-mediated synaptic inhibition in auditory cortex, but most research on critical period plasticity has focused on GABAA receptors. We developed viral vectors to express both endogenous GABAA or GABAB receptor subunits in auditory cortex and tested their capacity to restore perception of temporal and spectral auditory cues following critical period hearing loss in the Mongolian gerbil. HL significantly impaired perception of both temporal and spectral auditory cues. While both vectors similarly increased IPSCs in auditory cortex, only overexpression of GABAB receptors improved perceptual thresholds after HL to be similar to those of animals without developmental hearing loss. These findings identify the GABAB receptor as an important regulator of sensory perception in cortex and point to potential therapeutic targets for developmental sensory disorders.\n\nSignificance StatementHearing loss in children can induce deficits in aural communication that persevere even after audibility has returned to normal, suggesting permanent changes to the auditory central nervous system. In fact, a reduction in cortical synaptic inhibition has been implicated in a broad range of developmental disorders, including hearing loss. Here, we tested the hypothesis that developmental hearing loss-induced perceptual impairments in gerbils are caused by a permanent reduction of auditory cortical inhibitory synapse strength. We found that virally-mediated expression of a GABAB receptor subunit in gerbil auditory cortex was able to restore two auditory perceptual skills in juvenile animals reared with hearing loss, suggesting that cortical synaptic inhibition is a plausible therapeutic target for sensory processing disorders.",

    "abstract": "Foxb1-expressing neurons occur in the dorsal premammillary nucleus (PMd) and further rostrally in the parvafox nucleus, a longitudinal cluster of neurons in the lateral hypothalamus of rodents. The descending projection of these Foxb1+ neurons end in the dorsolateral part of the periaqueductal gray (dlPAG). The functional role of the Foxb1+ neuronal subpopulation in the PMd and the parvafox nucleus remains elusive. In this study, the activity of the Foxb1+ neurons and of their terminal endings in the dlPAG was selectively altered by employing chemo- and optogenetic tools. Our results show that in whole-body barometric plethysmography, hM3Dq-mediated, global Foxb1+ neuron excitation activates respiration. Time-resolved optogenetic gain-of-function manipulation of the terminal endings of Foxb1+ neurons in the rostral third of the dlPAG leads to abrupt immobility and bradycardia. Chemogenetic activation of Foxb1+ cell bodies and ChR2-mediated excitation of their axonal endings in the dlPAG led to a phenotypical presentation congruent with a \"freezing-like\" situation during innate defensive behavior.\n\nContact and competing interest information for all authorsContact: Marco R.

Peripheral neuropathies appeared as a specific COVID-19 symptom occurring at later stages of the disease. In order to understand the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the peripheral nervous system, we generated human sensory neurons from induced pluripotent stem cells that we infected with the SARS-CoV-2 strain WA1/2020 and the variants delta and omicron.

We found that well-trained monkeys rapidly infer rules but are three times slower than humans.

Cells lacking Bat1, a mitochondrial aminotransferase that synthesizes BCAAs, grew slower, were smaller, and were delayed in the G1 phase, phenocopying cells in which the growth-promoting kinase complex TORC1 was moderately inhibited. Loss of Bat1 lowered the levels of BCAAs and reduced TORC1 activity. Exogenous provision of BCAAs to cells lacking Bat1 promoted cell division and increased TORC1 activity. In wild-type cells, TORC1 activity was dynamic in the cell cycle, starting low in early G1 but increasing later in the cell cycle. These results suggest a link between BCAA synthesis from glucose to TORC1 activation in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EV) are nano-sized bilayer vesicles that are involved in biological functions and secreted by a wide variety of cells. Osteoblasts, the bone forming cells, can release a subset of EVs known as matrix vesicles (MtVs) which are believed to be involved in matrix mineralization and feature bone forming properties. Osteoblast-derived EVs or MtVs have been mostly isolated from conditions which are still far from nature, i.e. mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), or osteoblast cell lines cultured in two-dimensional (2D) tissue culture flasks. In our study, we aimed at investigating whether MtVs could also be isolated from an environment which better resembles the complex in vivo situation. This study investigated the EVs secretion during osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow MSCs (hBMSCs) in the most advanced human three-dimensional (3D) in vitro woven bone constructs previously developed by our group. hBMSCs were cultured in spinner flask bioreactors which induced wall shear stress on cells and directed the cells to differentiate towards osteoblasts and osteocytes. The EVs secreted into the culture medium were isolated and characterized based on their morphological, biological, and functional properties. The characteristics of a part of isolated EVs shared similarities with MtVs. These vesicles were electron-dense and electron-lucent, showed alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, increased the amount of released free phosphate into the culture medium, and increased the amount of deposited phosphate within the ECM. The results indicate that a complex 3D environment mimicking bone development is favorable to stimulate MtV-producing cells to produce targeted MtVs in vitro. These MtVs potentially could be used as a biological agent for bone regeneration and fracture healing through, for instance, integration with biomaterials to target bone formation locally.",

Here, we show that mice with severe isolated respiratory complex III (CIII) deficiency display nuclear DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, aberrant mitoses, cellular senescence, and laminopathy-like nuclei in the affected organs such as liver and kidney, and a systemic phenotype strikingly resembling juvenile-onset laminopathic and DNA repair-deficient progeroid syndromes. Mechanistically, CIII deficiency triggered presymptomatic cancer-like c-MYC upregulation followed by excessive anabolic metabolism and illicit cell proliferation against lack of energy and biosynthetic precursors. CIII-independent coenzyme Q oxidation dampened mitochondrial integrated stress response and the c-MYC induction, suppressed the illicit proliferation, and prevented juvenile lethality despite that canonical OXPHOS-linked functions remained uncorrected. Inhibition of c-MYC by expression of a dominant-negative Omomyc protein relieved the DNA damage in CIII-deficient hepatocytes in vivo. Our results unequivocally connect primary OXPHOS deficiency to genomic instability and progeroid disease and suggest that targeting c-MYC and aberrant cell proliferation may provide novel therapeutic strategies in mitochondrial diseases.",

    "abstract": "Overall balance of excitation and inhibition in cortical networks is central to their functionality and normal operation. Such orchestrated co-evolution of excitation and inhibition is established through convoluted local interactions between neurons, which are organized by specific network connectivity structures and are dynamically controlled by modulating synaptic activities. Therefore, identifying how such structural and physiological factors contribute to establishment of overall balance of excitation and inhibition is crucial in understanding the homeostatic plasticity mechanisms that regulate the balance. We use biologically plausible mathematical models to extensively study the effects of multiple key factors on overall balance of a network. We characterize a networks baseline balanced state by certain functional properties, and demonstrate how variations in physiological and structural parameters of the network deviate this balance and, in particular, result in transitions in spontaneous activity of the network to high-amplitude slow oscillatory regimes. We show that deviations from the reference balanced state can be continuously quantified by measuring the ratio of mean excitatory to mean inhibitory synaptic conductances in the network. Our results suggest that the commonly observed ratio of the number of inhibitory to the number of excitatory neurons in local cortical networks is almost optimal for their stability and excitability. Moreover, the values of inhibitory synaptic decay time constants and density of inhibitory-to-inhibitory network connectivity are critical to overall balance and stability of cortical networks. However, network stability in our results is sufficiently robust against modulations of synaptic quantal conductances, as required by their role in learning and memory.\n\nSummaryWe leverage computational tractability of a biologically plausible conductance-based meanfield model to perform a comprehensive bifurcation and sensitivity analysis that demonstrates how variations in key synaptic and structural parameters of a local cortical network affect networks stability and overall excitation-inhibition balance. Our results reveal optimality and criticality of baseline biological values for several of these parameters, and provide predictions on their effects on networks dynamics which can inform identifying pathological conditions and guide future experiments.",

    "abstract": "Spatial learning is critical for survival and its underlying neuronal mechanisms have been studied extensively. These studies have revealed a wealth of information about the neural representations of space, such as place cells and boundary cells. While many studies have focused on how these representations emerge in the brain, their functional role in driving spatial learning and navigation has received much less attention. We extended an existing computational modeling tool-chain to study the functional role of spatial representations using closed-loop simulations of spatial learning. At the heart of the model agent was a spiking neural network that formed a ring attractor. This network received inputs from place and boundary cells and the location of the activity bump in this network was the output. This output determined the movement directions of the agent. We found that the navigation performance depended on the parameters of the place cell input, such as their number, the place field sizes, and peak firing rate, as well as, unsurprisingly, the size of the goal zone. The dependence on the place cell parameters could be accounted for by just a single variable, the overlap index, but this dependence was nonmonotonic. By contrast, performance scaled monotonically with the Fisher information of the place cell population. Our results therefore demonstrate that efficiently encoding spatial information is critical for navigation performance.",

    "abstract": "Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD), the most common human prion disease, is thought to occur when the cellular prion protein (PrPC) spontaneously misfolds and assembles into prion fibrils, culminating in fatal neurodegeneration. In a genome-wide association study of sCJD, we recently identified risk variants in and around the gene STX6, with evidence to suggest a causal increase of STX6 expression in disease-relevant brain regions. STX6 encodes syntaxin-6, a SNARE protein primarily involved in early endosome to trans-Golgi network retrograde transport. Here we developed and characterised a mouse model with genetic depletion of Stx6 and investigated a causal role of Stx6 expression in mouse prion disease through a classical prion transmission study, assessing the impact of homozygous and heterozygous syntaxin-6 knockout on disease incubation periods and prion-related neuropathology. Following inoculation with RML prions, incubation periods in Stx6-/- and Stx6+/- mice differed by 12 days relative to wildtype. Similarly, in Stx6-/- mice, disease incubation periods following inoculation with ME7 prions also differed by 12 days. Histopathological analysis revealed a modest increase in astrogliosis in ME7-inoculated Stx6-/- animals and a variable effect of Stx6 expression on microglia activation, however no differences in neuronal loss, spongiform change or PrP deposition were observed at endpoint. Importantly, Stx6-/- mice are viable and fertile with no gross impairments on a range of neurological, biochemical, histological and skeletal structure tests. Our results provide some support for a pathological role of Stx6 expression in prion disease, which warrants further investigation in the context of prion disease but also other neurodegenerative diseases considering syntaxin-6 appears to have pleiotropic risk effects in progressive supranuclear palsy and Alzheimers disease.\n\nAuthor SummarySporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD), the most common human prion disease, is an invariably fatal disease with no established disease-modifying treatments. The identification of STX6 as a proposed risk gene for sCJD motivated the generation of a new mouse knockout model, in which we found no grossly deleterious phenotypes. A transmission study in Stx6-/-, Stx6+/- and Stx6+/+ mice challenged with two prion strains showed reduced syntaxin-6 expression is associated with a modest prolongation of prion disease incubation periods, supporting a pathological role of Stx6 expression in prion disease pathogenesis. Syntaxin-6 appears to have pleiotropic risk effects across multiple neurodegenerative diseases including progressive supranuclear palsy and Alzheimers disease. Thus, this work supports further exploration of the STX6 susceptibility mechanism, which likely has relevance across multiple neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "The role of the vertebrate retina in early vision is generally described by the efficient coding theory, which predicts that the retina discards spatiotemporal correlations in natural scenes. It is unclear, however, whether the predicted decorrelation in the activity of ganglion cells, the retinas output neurons, holds under gaze shifts, which dominate the natural visual input. We here show that species-specific gaze patterns in natural stimuli can drive strong and correlated spiking responses both within and across distinct types of ganglion cells in marmoset as well as mouse retina. These concerted responses violate efficient coding and signal fixation periods with locally high spatial contrast. Finally, novel model-based analyses of ganglion cell responses to natural stimuli reveal that the observed response correlations follow from nonlinear pooling of ganglion cell inputs. Our results reveal how concerted population activity can surpass efficient coding to detect gaze-related stimulus features.",

    "abstract": "Many cognitive functions are represented as cell assemblies. For example, the population activity of place cells in the hippocampus and grid cells in the entorhinal cortex represent self-location in the environment. The brain cannot directly observe self-location information in the environment. Instead, it relies on sensory information and memory to estimate self-location. Therefore, estimating low-dimensional dynamics, such as the movement trajectory of an animal exploring its environment, from only the high-dimensional neural activity is important in deciphering the information represented in the brain. Most previous studies have estimated the low-dimensional dynamics behind neural activity by unsupervised learning with dimensionality reduction using artificial neural networks or Gaussian processes. This paper shows theoretically and experimentally that these previous research approaches fail to estimate well when the nonlinearity between high-dimensional neural activity and low-dimensional dynamics becomes strong. We estimate the animals position in 2-D and 3-D space from the activity of grid cells using an unsupervised method based on persistent cohomology. The method using persistent cohomology estimates low-dimensional dynamics from the phases of manifolds created by neural activity. Much cognitive information, including self-location information, is expressed in the phases of the manifolds created by neural activity. The persistent cohomology may be useful for estimating these cognitive functions from neural population activity in an unsupervised manner.\n\nAuthor summaryHippocampal place cells fire only when the animal is in a specific position in the environment. Grid cells in entorhinal cortex fire to spatial locations in a repeating hexagonal grid. Information about self-location in the environment is expressed by the population activity of place cells and grid cells. The brain cannot directly observe the information of self-position in the environment but relies on the direction of movement, distance, and landmarks to estimate self-position. This corresponds to unsupervised learning. Estimating the position of an animal from neural activity alone, without using information about the animals position, is important for understanding the brains representation of information. Unsupervised learning methods using artificial neural networks and Gaussian processes have been used in previous studies to address this problem. However, we show that these previous studies cannot estimate the position of an animal in two dimensions from the population activity of grid cells. As an alternative to the previous studies, we used a topological method called persistent cohomolohy to estimate the animals position in 2D and 3D space from the population activity of grid cells. However, it was impossible to estimate the animals position from the population activity of place cells. We discussed the causes and solutions to this problem.",

    "abstract": "Individuals living with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience severe recurrent acute and chronic pain. In order to develop novel therapies, it is necessary to better understand the neurobiological mechanisms underlying SCD pain. There are many barriers to gaining mechanistic insight into pathogenic SCD pain processes, such as differential gene expression and function of sensory neurons between humans and mice with SCD, as well as the limited availability of patient samples. These can be overcome by utilizing SCD patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) differentiated into sensory neurons (SCD iSNs). Here, we characterize the key gene expression and function of SCD iSNs to establish a model for higher-throughput investigation of intrinsic and extrinsic factors that may contribute to increased SCD patient pain. Importantly, identified roles for C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2 (CCL2) and endothelin 1 (ET1) in SCD pain can be recapitulated in SCD iSNs. Further, we find that plasma taken from SCD patients during acute pain increases SCD iSN calcium response to the nociceptive stimulus capsaicin compared to those treated with paired SCD patient plasma at baseline or healthy control plasma samples. Together, these data provide the framework necessary to utilize iSNs as a powerful tool to investigate the neurobiology of SCD and identify potential intrinsic mechanisms of SCD pain which may extend beyond a blood-based pathology.\n\nKey PointsO_LISickle cell disease (SCD) stem cell derived sensory neurons (iSNs) recapitulate important SCD phenotypes in vitro.\nC_LIO_LISCD patient plasma sensitizes SCD iSNs to TRPV1 stimulation by capsaicin.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Recognizing spelling errors is important for correct writing and reading, and develops over an extended period. The neural bases of the development of orthographic sensitivity remain poorly understood. We investigated event-related potentials (ERPs) associated with spelling error recognition when performing the orthographic decision task with correctly spelled and misspelled words in children aged 8-10 years old, early adolescents aged 11-14 years old, and adults. Spelling processing in adults included an early stage associated with the initial recognition of conflict between orthography and phonology (reflected in the N400 time window) and a later stage (reflected in the P600 time window) related to re-checking the spelling. In children 8-10 years old, there were no differences in ERPs to correct and misspelled words; in addition, their behavioral scores were worse than those of early adolescents, implying that the ability to quickly recognize the correct spelling is just beginning to develop at this age. In early adolescents, spelling recognition was reflected only at the later stage, corresponding to the P600 component. At the behavioral level, they were worse than adults at recognizing misspelled words. Our data suggest that orthographic sensitivity can develop beyond 14 years.",

    "abstract": "Myelin defects lead to neurological dysfunction in various diseases and in normal aging. Chronic neuroinflammation often contributes to axon-myelin damage in these conditions and can be initiated and/or sustained by perturbed myelinating glia. We have previously shown that distinct mutations in the PLP1 gene result in neurodegeneration that is largely driven by adaptive immune cells. Here we characterize CD8+ CNS-associated T cells in these myelin mutants using single-cell transcriptomics and identify population heterogeneity and disease-associated changes. We demonstrate that early sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulation attenuates the recruitment of T cells and neural damage, while later targeting of CNS-associated T cell populations is inefficient and has no effect on neurodegeneration. Applying bone marrow chimerism and utilizing random X chromosome inactivation, we provide evidence that axonal damage is driven by cytotoxic, antigen specific CD8+ T cells that target mutant myelinating oligodendrocytes. These findings offer insights into neural-immune interactions and are of translational relevance for neurological conditions associated with myelin defects and neuroinflammation.",

    "abstract": "Predicting pathogenicity of Omicron sub-variants is critical for assessing disease dynamics and developing public health strategies. As an important virulence factor, SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein (2-E) causes cell death and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like pathological damages. Evaluation of 2-E mutations might offer clues to pathogenicity forecast. Here, the frequency and cell lethality of 92 mutations of 2-E in five early \"variants of concern\" (VOCs, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron BA.1, BA.2, BA.3, BA.4, and BA.5) were analyzed, which could be divided into three classes. Most (87) mutations belong to Class I, no obvious frequency changes. Class II consists of 2 mutations, exhibiting enhanced cell lethality but decreased frequency. The rest 3 mutations in Class III were characterized by attenuated cell lethality and increased frequency. Remarkably, the Class II mutations are always observed in the VOCs with high disease severity while the Class III mutations are highly conserved in the VOCs with weakened pathogenicity. For example, P71L, the most lethal mutation, dropped to nearly 0.00% in the milder Omicrons from 99.12% in Beta, while the less lethal mutation T9I, sharply increased to 99.70% in BA.1 and is highly conserved in BA.1-5. Accordingly, we proposed that some key 2-E mutations are pathogenicity markers of the virus. Notably, the highly contagious Omicron XBB retained T9I also. In addition, XBB gained a new dominant-negative mutation T11A with frequency 90.52%, exhibiting reduced cell lethality, cytokine induction and viral production capabilities in vitro, and particularly weakened lung damages in mice. No mutations with enhanced cell lethality were observed in XBB. These clues imply a further weakened pathogenicity of XBB among Omicron sub-variants.",

Understanding CRISPR/Cas9-mediated DSB induction and subsequent repair dynamics requires measuring the rate of cutting and that of precise repair, a hidden-variable of the repair machinery. Here, we present a molecular and computational toolkit for multiplexed quantification of DSB intermediates and repairproducts by single-molecule sequencing. Using this approach, we characterized the dynamics of DSB induction, processing and repair at endogenous loci along a 72-hour time-course in tomato protoplasts. Combining this data with kinetic modeling reveals that indel accumulation is not an accurate reflection of DSB induction efficiency due to prominent precise re-ligation, accounting for 40-70% of all repair events. Altogether, this system exposes previously unseen flux in the DSB repair process, decoupling induction and repair dynamics, and suggesting an essential role of high-fidelity repair in limiting CRISPR editing efficiency in somatic cells.",

    "abstract": "Echolocation was a key development in toothed whale evolution, favoring their ecological success and adaptive radiation across multiple habitats. Previous bioacoustic and morphological studies suggest that environmental pressures have influenced the evolution of echolocation in odontocetes. This hypothesis demands further investigation, especially regarding molecular mechanisms involved in odontocetes adaptive radiation across multiple habitats. Here we show that the coding sequences of four hearing genes involved in echolocation (CDH23, SLC26A5, TMC1 and CLDN14) have different signatures of molecular evolution among riverine, coastal and oceanic dolphins, suggesting that the evolutionary constraints of these habitats have shaped the genetic diversity underlying toothed whale sonars. Our comparative analysis across 37 odontocete species has revealed patterns of accelerated evolution within coastal and riverine lineages, supporting the hypothesis that these habitats generate specific selective pressures to sonar propagation, which are not found in the ocean (e.g., clutter and reverberation). Specific branches with sites under diversifying selection include: three coastal/estuarine species which have recently diverged from closely-related lineages inhabiting freshwater (Cephalorhynchus commersonii, Sotalia guianensis and Orcaella heinsohni - CDH23), and three species that operate specialized Narrow Band High Frequency Sonars (Phocoena sinus - SLC26A5, Neophocaena phocaenoides and Cephalorhynchus commersonii - CDH23). All positively selected lineages are coastal or estuarine from shallow waters (< 100), corroborating current knowledge on these species sonars. Among river dolphin branches, positive selection was found on specific sites of the genes CDH23 and SLC26A5, when compared to other cetaceans and Laurasiatherians. Finally, the detection of sites with different overall substitution rates (dN/dS) among river and marine dolphins, together with the finding of different amounts of positively selected sites in each environmental group, suggests distinct selective pressures acting in these groups in the molecular evolution of echolocation.",

    "abstract": "Alternative Polyadenylation (APA) is an emerging mechanism for dynamic changes in gene expression. Previously, we described widespread APA occurrence in introns during the DNA damage response (DDR). Here, we show that a DNA damage activated APA event occurs in the first intron of CDKN1A, inducing an alternate last exon (ALE)-containing lncRNA. We named this lncRNA SPUD (Selective Polyadenylation Upon Damage). SPUD localizes to polysomes in the cytoplasm and is detectable as multiple isoforms in available high throughput studies. SPUD has low abundance compared to the CDKN1A full-length isoform and is induced in cancer and normal cells under a variety of DNA damaging conditions in part through p53 transcriptional activation. RNA binding protein (RBP) HuR and the transcriptional repressor CTCF regulate SPUD levels. SPUD induction increases p21 protein, but not CDKN1A full-length levels, affecting p21 functions in cell-cycle, CDK2 expression, and cell viability. Like CDKN1A full-length isoform, SPUD can bind two competitive p21 translational regulators, the inhibitor calreticulin and the activator CUGBP1; SPUD can change their association with CDKN1A full-length in a DDR-dependent manner. Together, these results show a new regulatory mechanism by which a lncRNA controls p21 expression post-transcriptionally, highlighting lncRNA relevance in DDR progression and cellcycle.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) is a master regulator of translation control. eIF2B recycles inactive eIF2-GDP to active eIF2-GTP. Under transient/acute cellular stress, a family of kinases phosphorylate the alpha subunit of eIF2 (eIF2-P[S51]) activating the integrated stress response (ISR). This response pathway inhibits eIF2B activity resulting in overall translation attenuation and reprogramming of gene expression to overcome the stress. The duration of an ISR programme can dictate cell fate wherein chronic activation has pathological outcomes. Vanishing white matter disease (VWMD) is a chronic ISR-related disorder linked to mutations in eIF2B. eIF2B is vital to all cell types, yet VWMD eIF2B mutations primarily affect astrocytes and oligodendrocytes suggesting cell type-specific functions of eIF2B. Regulation of the cytoplasmic localisation of eIF2B (eIF2B bodies) has been implicated in the ISR. Here, we highlight the cell type specific localisation of eIF2B within neuronal and glial cell types. Our analyses revealed that each cell type possesses its own steady-state repertoire of eIF2B bodies with varied subunit composition and activity. We also demonstrate that neural and glial cell types respond similarly to acute induction of the ISR whilst a chronic ISR programme exerts cell type-specific differences. Regulatory composition of eIF2B bodies is suggested to be differentially modulated in a manner that correlates to the action of acute and chronic ISR. We also highlight a cell type specific response of the ISR inhibitor ISRIB on eIF2B localisation and activity.",

However, the continuous nature of evolutionary change is difficult to reconcile with the discrete outcome of speciation, especially where species boundaries are permeable. A good example of this inconsistency is the lichen genus Pyrenodesmia, which shows a high morphologic and genetic diversity that that defies systematization by taxonomic or phylogenetic methods. Here we show that hybridization explains the presence of discordant morphs and that European species are interconnected through cross-mating in a single reproductive network, a syngameon, despite which species remain largely distinct and distinguishable. Whole genome data reflect the important role played by genome defense mechanisms in the genomic stabilization of fungal hybrids. The recurrence of Repeat Induced Point mutations (RIP) shapes genomes with islands of suppressed recombination and loss of gene content, which in turn generates a feedback loop reinforcing the lack of reproductive isolation through the loss of heterokaryon incompatibility and a tendency towards morphological reduction.",

Here we performed detailed genomic investigations on 454 ST34 genomes collected from Vietnam and diverse geographical sources to elucidate the pathogens epidemiology, evolution and antimicrobial resistance. We showed that ST34 has been introduced into Vietnam in at least nine occasions since 2000, forming five co-circulating major clones responsible for paediatric diarrhoea and bloodstream infection. Most expansion events were associated with acquisitions of large multidrug resistance plasmids of IncHI2 or IncA/C2. Particularly, the self-conjugative IncA/C2 pST34VN2 (co-transferring blaCTX-M-55, mcr-3.1, and qnrS1) underlies local expansion and intercontinental spread in two separate ST34 clones. At the global scale, Southeast Asia was identified as a hotspot for the emergence and dissemination of multidrug resistant Salmonella ST34, and mutation analysis suggests of selection in antimicrobial responses and key virulence factors. Our work enriches the understanding on epidemiology and evolution of this variant in Southeast Asia, and determines that multidrug resistance plasmids have driven its local and potentially global success.",

This study aims to address common and tissue-specific sex differences in metabolism in the retina, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), lens and brain under fed and fasted conditions.\n\nMethodsAfter ad libitum fed or deprived of food for 18 hours, mouse eye tissues (retina, RPE/choroid, and lens), brain, and plasma were harvested for targeted metabolomics. The data were analyzed with both Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and Volcano Plot analysis.\n\nResultsAmong 133 metabolites that cover major metabolic pathways, we found 9-45 metabolites that are sex-different in different tissues under the fed state and 6-18 metabolites under the fasted state. Among these sex-different metabolites, 33 were changed in two or more tissues, and 64 were tissue-specific. Pantothenic acid, hypotaurine and 4-hydroxyproline were the top commonly changed metabolites. Lens and retina had the most tissue-specific sex-different metabolites enriched in the metabolism of amino acid, nucleotide, lipids and TCA cycle. Lens and brain had more similar sex-different metabolites than other occular tissues. Female RPE and female brain were more sensitive to fasting with more reduced metabolites in amino acid metabolism, TCA cycle and glycolysis. The plasma had the least sex-different metabolites with very few overlapping changes with tissues.\n\nConclusionSex has a strong influence on eye and brain metabolism in tissue-specific and metabolic state-specific manners.

However, they also appear in many diseases such as atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, infections, inflammatory diseases, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. Thus, it is necessary to have detection systems for lipids and amphiphilic molecules. Microbeads can be one of these systems for the simultaneous detection of different lipophilic biomarkers.\n\nMethodsBased on the fundamentals of microbead development, novel hydrophobic microbeads were produced. These not only have a hydrophobic surface, but are also fluorescently encoded and organic solvent resistant. The challenge after the development of the hydrophobic microbeads was to immobilise the amphiphilic molecules, in this study phospholipids, on the microbead surface in an oriented direction. After successful immobilisation of the biomarkers, a suitable antibody based detection assay was established.\n\nResultsBy passive adsorption, the phospholipids cardiolipin, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine could be bound to the microbead surface. With the application of the enzymes phospholipase A2 and phospholipase C, the directional binding of the phospholipids to the microbead surface was demonstrated. The detection of directional binding indicated the need for the hydrophobic surface. Microbeads with no hydrophobic surface bound the phospholipids non-directionally (with the hydrophilic head) and were thus no longer reactively accessible for detection.\n\nConclusionWith the newly developed hydrophobic, dual coded and solvent stable microbeads it is possible to bind amphiphilic biomolecules directionally onto the microbead surfaces.",

By engineering and utilizing a branched K48-K63-Ub chain-specific nanobody, we reveal roles for these chains in VCP/p97-related processes. In summary, we provide a blueprint to investigate branched Ub function that can be readily applied to study other branched chain types.\n\nHighlightsO_LIAssembly of defined branched ubiquitin chains enables identification of specific binding proteins\nC_LIO_LIDevelopment of quantitative DUB assay monitoring cleavage of individual Ub linkages within complex ubiquitin chains identifies debranching enzymes\nC_LIO_LIEngineering specific, high-affinity nanobody against branched K48-K63 ubiquitin reveals roles in VCP/p97 related processes and DNA damage responses\nC_LIO_LIGeneral blueprint of new methods and tools for in-depth characterization of branched ubiquitin chains and their underlying biology\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Living cells can leverage correlations in environmental fluctuations to predict the future environment and mount a response ahead of time. To this end, cells need to encode the past signal into the output of the intracellular network from which the future input is predicted. Yet, storing information is costly while not all features of the past signal are equally informative on the future input signal. Here, we show, for two classes of input signals, that cellular networks can reach the fundamental bound on the predictive information as set by the information extracted from the past signal: pushpull networks can reach this information bound for Markovian signals, while networks that take a temporal derivative can reach the bound for predicting the future derivative of non-Markovian signals. However, the bits of past information that are most informative about the future signal are also prohibitively costly. As a result, the optimal system that maximizes the predictive information for a given resource cost is, in general, not at the information bound. Applying our theory to the chemotaxis network of Escherichia coli reveals that its adaptive kernel is optimal for predicting future concentration changes over a broad range of background concentrations, and that the system has been tailored to predicting these changes in shallow gradients.",

    "abstract": "Interendothelial slits in the spleen fulfill the major physiological function of continuously filtering red blood cells (RBCs) from the bloodstream to remove abnormal and aged cells. To date, the process of passage of 8 m RBCs through 0.3-m wide slits remains enigmatic. Should the slits increase their caliber during RBC passage as sometimes proposed in the literature? Here, we elucidated the mechanisms that govern the passage dynamics or retention of RBCs in slits by combining multiscale modeling, live imaging, and microfluidic experiments on an original device with slits of defined physiological dimensions, including submicron width. We observed that healthy RBCs pass through 0.28-m wide rigid slits at body temperature. To achieve this tour de force, they must meet two requirements. Geometrically, their surface area-to-volume ratio must be compatible with a shape in two tether-connected equal spheres. Mechanically, they must be able to locally unfold their spectrin cytoskeleton inside the slits. In contrast, activation of the mechanosensitive PIEZO1 channel is not required. The RBC transit time through slits scales with in-slit pressure drop and slit width to the -1 and -3 power, respectively. This transit dynamics is similar to that of a Newtonian fluid in a 2D Poiseuille flow, thus showing that it is controlled by the RBC cytoplasmic viscosity. Altogether, our results clearly show that filtration through submicron-wide slits is possible without further slit opening. Furthermore, our approach addresses the critical need for in-vitro evaluation of splenic clearance of diseased or engineered RBCs for transfusion and drug delivery.\n\nSignificance StatementSplenic filtration of red blood cells through narrow interendothelial slits remains poorly understood despite its physiological significance as experiments and imaging of red cells passing through the slits are lacking. Here, we coupled live imaging, biomimetic submicron-fluidics, and multiscale modeling to quantify passage conditions. Remarkably, healthy 8-m cells can pass through 0.28-m slits at body temperature. This event is conditioned to cells being able to deform into two tether-connected equal spheres and to unfold their spectrin cytoskeleton. We showed that cells behave like a Newtonian fluid and that their dynamics is controlled by the inner fluid viscosity We thus propose an in-vitro and in-silico approach to quantify splenic clearance of diseased cells and cells engineered for transfusion and drug delivery",

    "abstract": "Assembly of the microtubule-associated protein into tauopathy fibril conformations dictates the pathology of a diversity of diseases. Recent cryogenic Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) structures have uncovered distinct fibril conformations in different tauopathies but it remains unknown how these structures fold from a single protein sequence. It has been proposed that post-translational modifications may drive tau assembly but no direct mechanism for how modifications drive assembly has emerged. Leveraging established aggregation-regulating tau fragments that are normally inert, we tested the effect of chemical modification of lysines with acetyl groups on tau fragment conversion into amyloid aggregates. We identify specific patterns of acetylation that flank amyloidogenic motifs on the tau fragments that drive rapid fibril assembly. To understand how this pattern of acetylation may drive assembly, we determined a 3.9 [A] cryo-EM structure of an amyloid fibril assembled from an acetylated tau fragment. The structure uncovers how lysine acetylation patterns mediate gain-of-function interactions to promote amyloid assembly. Comparison of the structure to an ex vivo tau fibril conformation from Picks Disease reveals regions of high structural similarity. Finally, we show that our lysine- acetylated sequences exhibit fibril assembly activity in cell-based tau aggregation assays. Our data uncover the dual role of lysine residues in limiting aggregation while their acetylation leads to stabilizing pro-aggregation interactions. Design of tau sequence with specific acetylation patterns may lead to controllable tau aggregation to direct folding of tau into distinct folds.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma is the most lethal brain cancer in adults. These incurable tumors are characterized by profound heterogeneity, therapy resistance, and diffuse infiltration. These traits have been linked to cancer stem cells, which are important for glioblastoma tumor progression and recurrence. The fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) signaling pathway is a known regulator of therapy resistance and cancer stemness in glioblastoma. FGFR1 expression shows intertumoral heterogeneity and higher FGFR1 expression is associated with a significantly poorer survival in glioblastoma patients. The role of FGFR1 in tumor invasion has been studied in many cancers, but whether and how FGFR1 mediates glioblastoma invasion remains to be determined. Here, we investigated the distribution and functional relevance of FGFR1 and FGFR2 in human glioblastoma xenograft models. We found FGFR1, but not FGFR2, expressed in invasive glioblastoma cells. Loss of FGFR1, but not FGFR2, significantly reduced cell migration in vitro and tumor invasion in human glioblastoma xenografts. Comparative analysis of RNA-sequencing data of FGFR1 and FGFR2 knockdown glioblastoma cells revealed a FGFR1-specific gene regulatory network associated with tumor invasion. Our study reveals new gene candidates linked to FGFR1-mediated glioblastoma invasion.",

    "abstract": "Hypoxia, an important feature of solid tumors, is a major factor shaping the immune landscape, and several cancer models have been developed to emulate hypoxic tumors. However, to date, they still have several limitations, such as the lack of reproducibility, inadequate biophysical cues, limited immune cell infiltration, and poor oxygen (O2) control, leading to non-pathophysiological tumor responses. As a result, it is essential to develop new and improved cancer models that mimic key features of the tumor extracellular matrix and recreate tumor-associated hypoxia while allowing cell infiltration and cancer-immune cell interactions. Herein, hypoxia-inducing cryogels (HICs) have been engineered using hyaluronic acid (HA) as macroporous scaffolds to fabricate three-dimensional microtissues and model a hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Specifically, tumor cell-laden HICs have been designed to deplete O2 locally and induce long-standing hypoxia. This state of low oxygen tension, leading to HIF-1 stabilization in tumor cells, resulted in changes in hypoxia-responsive gene expression and phenotype, a metabolic adaptation to anaerobic glycolysis, and chemotherapy resistance. Additionally, HIC-supported tumor models induced dendritic cell (DC) inhibition, revealing a phenotypic change in plasmacytoid B220+ DC (pDC) subset and an impaired conventional B220- DC (cDC) response in hypoxia. Lastly, our HIC-based melanoma model induced CD8+ T cell inhibition, a condition associated with the downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, increased expression of immunomodulatory factors, and decreased degranulation and cytotoxic capacity of T cells. Overall, these data suggest that HICs can be used as a tool to model solid-like tumor microenvironments and identify a phenotypic transition from cDC to pDC in hypoxia and the key contribution of HA in retaining cDC phenotype and inducing their hypoxia-mediated immunosuppression. This technology has great potential to deepen our understanding of the complex relationships between cancer and immune cells in low O2 conditions and may pave the way for developing more effective therapies.",

    "abstract": "An immunosuppressive microenvironment causes poor tumour T-cell infiltration and is associated with reduced patient overall survival in colorectal cancer. How to improve treatment responses in these tumours is still a challenge. Using an integrated screening approach to identify cancer-specific vulnerabilities, we identify complement receptor C5aR1 as a druggable target which when inhibited improves radiotherapy even in tumours displaying immunosuppressive features and poor CD8+ T-cell infiltration. While C5aR1 is well-known for its role in the immune compartment, we find that C5aR1 is also robustly expressed on malignant epithelial cells, highlighting potential tumour-cell specific functions. C5aR1 targeting results in increased NF-{kappa}B-dependent apoptosis specifically in tumours and not normal tissues; indicating that in malignant cells, C5aR1 primarily regulates cell fate. Collectively, these data reveal that increased complement gene expression is part of the stress response mounted by irradiated tumours and that targeting C5aR1 can improve radiotherapy even in tumours displaying immunosuppressive features.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMutation of the PRDM16 gene has been associated with human cardiomyopathy. The PRDM16 protein is a transcriptional regulator affecting cardiac development via Tbx5 and Hand1 regulating myocardial structure. Biallelic Prdm16 inactivation induces severe cardiac dysfunction with postnatal lethality and hypertrophy in mice. Early pathological events upon Prdm16 inactivation have not been explored.\n\nMethodsThis study performed in depth pathophysiological and molecular analysis of male and female Prdm16csp1/wt mice carrying systemic, monoallelic Prdm16 gene inactivation. We systematically assessed early molecular changes with transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. Kinetic modelling of the cardiac metabolism was undertaken in silico with CARDIOKIN.\n\nResultsPrdm16csp1/wt mice are viable up to 8 months, develop hypoplastic hearts, and diminished systolic performance that is more pronounced in female mice. Prdm16csp1/wt hearts demonstrate moderate alterations of specific transcripts and protein levels with consistent upregulation of pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductase domain 2 (Pyroxd2) and the transcriptional regulator pre B-cell leukemia transcription factor interacting protein 1 (Pbxip1). The strongest concordant transcriptional upregulation was detected for Prdm16 itself probably by an autoregulatory mechanism. Prdm16csp1/wt cardiac tissue showed reduction of metabolites associated with amino acid as well as glycerol metabolism, glycolysis, and tricarboxylic acid cycle. Global lipid metabolism was also affected with accumulation of triacylglycerides detected in male Prdm16csp1/wt hearts. In addition, Prdm16csp1/wt cardiac tissue revealed diminished glutathione (GSH) and increased inosine monophosphate (IMP) levels indicating oxidative stress and a dysregulated energetics, respectively. Metabolic modelling in silico suggested lowered fatty acid utilization in male and reduced glucose utilization in female Prdm16csp1/wt cardiac tissue.\n\nConclusionsMonoallelic Prdm16 mutation restricts cardiac performance in Prdm16csp1/wt mice. Metabolic alterations precede transcriptional dysregulation in Prdm16csp1/wt cardiac tissue. Female Prdm16csp1/wt mice develop a more pronounced phenotype indicating a sexual dimorphism at this early pathological window. This study suggests that metabolic dysregulation is an early event in PRDM16 associated cardiac pathology.\n\nNovelty and SignificanceO_ST_ABSWhat Is Known?C_ST_ABS- Mutation of the PRDM16 gene has been associated with human cardiomyopathy.\n- Biallelic inactivation of Prdm16 in mice induces severe cardiac dysfunction with early postnatal lethality.\n- Prdm16 cooperates with transcription factors such as Tbx5 and Hand1 to activate transcriptional programs that define the development of the compacted myocardium.\n\n\nWhat New Information Does This Article Contribute?- Systemic, monoallelic inactivation in Prdm16csp1/wt mice induces cardiac dysfunction with normal survival.\n- Metabolic alterations are the leading pathophysiological consequences and induce cardiac hypoplasia. On the molecular level this is associated with upregulation of metabolic regulators Pyroxd2 and Pbxip1.\n- Metabolic response after Prdm16 inactivation occurs in a sex specific manner.",

We quantified treatment and host genotype effects on the microbiome. Plant genotype and source environment were predictive of microbiome composition. Genome wide association analysis identified host genetic variants linked to both rhizosphere microbiome composition and source environment. We identified transposon insertions in a candidate gene linked to both the abundance of a keystone microbe Massilia and source total soil nitrogen, finding mutant plants to show a reduction in lateral root density. We conclude that locally adapted maize varieties exert patterns of genetic control on their root and rhizosphere microbiomes that follow variation in their home environments, consistent with a role in tolerance to prevailing stress.",

    "abstract": "The jellyfish Cassiopea largely cover their organic carbon demand via photosynthates produced by their microalgal endosymbionts, but how holobiont morphology and optical properties affect the light microclimate and symbiont photosynthesis in Cassiopea remain unexplored. Here, we use optical coherence tomography (OCT) to study the morphology of live Cassiopea medusae at high spatial resolution. We include detailed 3D reconstructions of external micromorphology, and show the spatial distribution of endosymbionts clustered in amoebocytes and white granules in the bell tissue. Furthermore, we use OCT data to extract inherent optical properties from light scattering white granules in Cassiopea and show that white granules enhance local light availability for symbionts in close proximity. Individual granules had a scattering coefficient of s = 200-300 cm-1, and a scattering anisotropy factor of g = 0.7, while large tissue regions filled with white granules had a lower s = 40-100 cm-1, and g = 0.8-0.9. We combined OCT information with an isotopic labelling experiment to investigate the effect of enhanced light availability in whitish tissue regions. Algal symbionts located in whitish tissue exhibited significantly higher carbon fixation as compared to symbionts in anastomosing tissue (i.e., tissue without light scattering white granules). Our findings support previous suggestions that white granules in Cassiopea play an important role in the host modulation of the light-microenvironment.",

In tumors with high levels of chromosomal instability, subclonal copy number alterations (CNAs) are a prevalent feature which often result in heterogeneous cancer cell populations with distinct phenotypes1. However, the extent to which subclonal CNAs contribute to clone-specific phenotypes remains poorly understood, in part due to the lack of methods to quantify how CNAs influence gene expression at a subclone level. We developed TreeAlign, which computationally integrates independently sampled single-cell DNA and RNA sequencing data from the same cell population and explicitly models gene dosage effects from subclonal alterations. We show through quantitative benchmarking data and application to human cancer data with single cell DNA and RNA libraries that TreeAlign accurately encodes clone-specific transcriptional effects of subclonal CNAs, the impact of allelic imbalance on allele-specific transcription, and obviates the need to arbitrarily define genotypic clones from a phylogenetic tree a priori. Combined, these advances lead to highly granular definitions of clones with distinct copy-number driven expression programs with increased resolution and accuracy over competing methods. The resulting improvement in assignment of transcriptional phenotypes to genomic clones enables clone-clone gene expression comparisons and explicit inference of genes that are mechanistically altered through CNAs, and identification of expression programs that are genomically independent. Our approach sets the stage for dissecting the relative contribution of fixed genomic alterations and dynamic epigenetic processes on gene expression programs in cancer.",

    "abstract": "MOM1 is an Arabidopsis factor previously shown to mediate transcriptional silencing independent of major DNA methylation changes. Here we found that MOM1 localizes with sites of RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). Tethering MOM1 with artificial zinc finger to unmethylated FWA promoter led to establishment of DNA methylation and FWA silencing. This process was blocked by mutations in components of the Pol V arm of the RdDM machinery, as well as by mutation of MORC6. We found that at some endogenous RdDM sites, MOM1 is required to maintain DNA methylation and a closed chromatin state. In addition, efficient silencing of newly introduced FWA transgenes was impaired by mutation of MOM1 or mutation of genes encoding the MOM1 interacting PIAL1/2 proteins. In addition to RdDM sites, we identified a group of MOM1 peaks at active chromatin near genes that colocalized with MORC6. These findings demonstrate a multifaceted role of MOM1 in genome regulation.",

    "abstract": "Experiential decision-making can be explained as a result of either memory-based or reinforcement-based processes. Here, for the first time, we show that individual preferences between a memory-based and a reinforcement-based strategy, even when the two are functionally equivalent in terms of expected payoff, are adaptively shaped by individual differences in resting-state brain connectivity between the corresponding brain regions. Using computational cognitive models to identify which mechanism was most likely used by each participant, we found that individuals with comparatively stronger connectivity between memory regions prefer a memory-based strategy, while individuals with comparatively stronger connectivity between sensorimotor and habit-formation regions preferentially rely on a reinforcement-based strategy. These results suggest that human decision-making is adaptive and sensitive to the neural costs associated with different strategies.\n\nAuthor SummaryOur study investigated two possible mechanisms for learning from experience, either by relying on memorizing details of events or by learning from rewards and punishments. Do individuals show preference for using one mechanism over another? And, if so, can we predict this preference from their brain patterns? Using an experimental task that can be carried out with either mechanism and computational models to analyze behavior and neural data, we found that different individuals do show a preference for either memory-based or reward-based learning strategies. Most importantly, a machine learning model can predict an individuals preference from ones resting-state brain connectivity with high accuracy, and the predictive brain connections are in agreement with our understanding of memory-based and reward-based learning strategies. This is the first time weve seen such a clear link between brain connectivity and decision-making strategy preference. Our research suggests that human brains are rational and adaptive, and carry out tasks using the most efficient neural circuitry.",

    "abstract": "All life must solve how to allocate limited energy resources to maximise benefits from scarce opportunities. Economic theory posits decision makers optimise choice by maximising the subjective benefit (utility) of reward minus the subjective cost (disutility) of the required effort. While successful in many settings, this model does not fully account for how experience can alter reward-effort trade-offs. Here we test how well the subtractive model of effort disutility explains the behavior of two non-human primates (Macaca mulatta) in a binary choice task in which reward quantity and physical effort to obtain were varied.Applying random utility modelling to independently estimate reward utility and effort disutility, we show the subtractive effort model better explains out-of-sample choice behavior when compared to parabolic and exponential effort discounting. Furthermore, we demonstrate that effort disutility is dependent on previous experience of effort: in analogy to work from behavioral labour economics, we develop a model of reference-dependent effort disutility to explain the increased willingness to expend effort following previous experience of effortful options in a session. The result of this analysis suggests that monkeys discount reward by an effort cost that is measured relative to an expected effort learned from previous trials. When this subjective cost of effort, a function of context and experience, is accounted for, trial-by-trial choice behavior can be explained by the subtractive cost model of effort.Therefore, in searching for net utility signals that may underpin effort-based decision-making in the brain, careful measurement of subjective effort costs is an essential first step.\n\nSignificanceAll decision-makers need to consider how much effort they need to expend when evaluating potential options. Economic theories suggest that the optimal way to choose is by cost-benefit analysis of reward against effort. To be able to do this efficiently over many decision contexts, this needs to be done flexibly, with appropriate adaptation to context and experience. Therefore, in aiming to understand how this might be achieved in the brain, it is important to first carefully measure the subjective cost of effort. Here we show monkeys make reward-effort cost-benefit decisions, subtracting the subjective cost of effort from the subjective value of rewards. Moreover, the subjective cost of effort is dependent on the monkeys experience of effort in previous trials.",

    "abstract": "Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) reduces chronic pain. Conventional (40-60 Hz) SCS engages spinal inhibitory mechanisms by activating low-threshold mechanoreceptive afferents with axons in the dorsal columns (DCs). But activating DC axons typically causes a buzzing sensation (paresthesia) that can be uncomfortable. Kilohertz-frequency (1-10 kHz) SCS produces analgesia without paresthesia and is thought, therefore, not to activate DC axons, leaving its mechanism unclear. Here we show in rats that kilohertz-frequency SCS activates DC axons but causes them to spike less synchronously than conventional SCS. Spikes desynchronize because axons entrain irregularly when stimulated at intervals shorter than their refractory period, a phenomenon we call overdrive desynchronization. Effects of overdrive desynchronization on evoked compound action potentials were verified in simulations, rats, pigs, and a chronic pain patient. Whereas synchronous spiking in DC axons is necessary for paresthesia, asynchronous spiking is sufficient to produce analgesia. Asynchronous activation of DC axons thus produces paresthesia-free analgesia.",

TRBs can also recruit Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) to deposit tri-methylation of H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) over certain target loci. Here, we demonstrate that TRBs also associate and colocalize with JUMONJI14 (JMJ14) and trigger H3K4me3 demethylation at some loci. The trb1/2/3 triple mutant and the jmj14-1 mutant show an increased level of H3K4me3 over TRB and JMJ14 binding sites, resulting in up-regulation of their target genes. Furthermore, tethering TRBs to the promoter region of genes with an artificial zinc finger (TRB-ZF) successfully triggers target gene silencing, as well as H3K27me3 deposition, and H3K4me3 removal. Interestingly, JMJ14 is predominantly recruited to ZF off-target sites with low levels of H3K4me3, which is accompanied with TRB-ZFs triggered H3K4me3 removal at these loci. These results suggest that TRB proteins coordinate PRC2 and JMJ14 activities to repress target genes via H3K27me3 deposition and H3K4me3 removal.",

Functioning as uniporters and thus facilitating the diffusion of sugars across cell membranes, SWEETs play an important role in various physiological processes such as abiotic stress adaptation. AtSWEET17, a vacuolar fructose facilitator, was shown to be involved in the modulation of the root system during drought. Moreover, overexpression of a homolog from apple results in increased drought tolerance of tomato plants. Therefore, SWEET17 appears to be essential for the plants drought response. Nevertheless, the role and function of SWEET17 in aboveground tissues under drought stress to date remains enigmatic. By combining gene expression analysis with analysis of the sugar profile of various aboveground tissues, we uncovered a putative role of SWEET17 in the carbohydrate supply, and thus cauline branch emergence and growth, particularly during periods of carbon limitation as occurs under drought stress. SWEET17 thereby being of critical importance for maintaining efficient reproduction under drought stress.\n\nHighlightThe fructose transporter SWEET17 supports shoot branching by increasing mobilization of carbohydrates from vacuoles to supply the newly forming inflorescence branch, thereby maintaining efficient reproduction under drought stress.",

Thus, unlike living cells, cell-free systems are amenable to rapid adjustment of the reaction composition and easy sampling. Further, because cellular growth and maintenance requirements are absent, all resources can go toward synthesizing the product of interest. Recent improvement in key performance metrics, such as yield, reaction duration, and portability, has increased the space of possible applications open to cell-free systems and lowered the time required to design-build-test new circuitry. One promising application area is biosensing. This study describes developing and modeling a D-gluconate biosensor circuit operating in a reconstituted cell-free system. Model parameters were estimated using time-resolved measurements of the mRNA and protein concentration with and without the addition of D-gluconate. Sensor performance was predicted using the model for D-gluconate concentrations not used in model training. The model predicted the transcription and translation kinetics and the dose response of the circuit over several orders of magnitude of D-gluconate concentration. Global sensitivity analysis of the model parameters gave detailed insight into the operation of the sensor circuit. Taken together, this study reported an in-depth, systems-level analysis of a D-gluconate biosensor circuit operating in a reconstituted cell-free system. This circuit could be used directly to estimate D-gluconate or as a subsystem in a more extensive synthetic gene expression program.",

Single cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) has facilitated the identification of such genes, but various challenges limit the analysis of certain cell types and lowly expressed genes.

We profile all the major constituent cell types, including several that are fragile or difficult to process and thus absent from existing scRNAseq-based atlases. The stability and read depth of bulk RNAseq data, and the high number of biological replicates analysed, allowed us to identify lowly expressed cell type enriched genes that are difficult to classify using existing methods. We identify co-enriched gene panels shared by pancreatic alpha and beta cells, chart temporal changes in cell enrichment signatures during spermatogenesis, and reveal that cells in the hair root are a major source of skin enriched genes. In a cross-tissue analysis, we identify shared gene enrichment signatures between highly metabolic and motile cell types, and core identity profiles of cell types found in across tissue types.

We employed a machine-learning model selection framework to evaluate whether existing microstructure might predict individual differences in the potential for learning a sensorimotor task, and further, if the mapping between the microstructure of major white matter tracts and learning was selective for learning outcomes. We used diffusion tractography to measure the mean fractional anisotropy (FA) of white matter tracts in 60 adult participants who then underwent training and subsequent testing to evaluate learning. During training, participants practiced drawing a set of 40 novel symbols repeatedly using a digital writing tablet. We measured drawing learning as the slope of draw duration over the practice session and visual recognition learning as the performance accuracy in an old/new 2-AFC recognition task. Results demonstrated that the microstructure of major white matter tracts selectively predicted learning outcomes, with left hemisphere pArc and SLF 3 tracts predicting drawing learning and the left hemisphere MDLFspl predicting visual recognition learning. These results were replicated in a repeat, held-out data set and supported with complementary analyses.

    "abstract": "Changes in gene regulation have long been thought to underlie most phenotypic differences between species. Subterranean rodents, and in particular the naked mole-rat, have attracted substantial attention due to their proposed phenotypic adaptations, which include hypoxia tolerance, metabolic changes and cancer resistance. However, it is largely unknown what regulatory changes may associate with these phenotypic traits, and whether these are unique to the naked mole-rat, the mole-rat clade or also present in other mammals. Here, we investigate regulatory evolution in heart and liver from two African mole-rat species and two rodent outgroups using genome-wide epigenomic profiling.\n\nFirst, we adapted and applied a phylogenetic modeling approach to quantitatively compare epigenomic signals at orthologous regulatory elements, and identified thousands of promoter and enhancer regions with differential epigenomic activity in mole-rats. These elements associate with known mole-rat adaptation in metabolic and functional pathways, and suggest candidate genetic loci that may underlie mole-rat innovations. Second, we evaluated ancestral and species-specific regulatory changes in the study phylogeny, and report several candidate pathways experiencing stepwise remodeling during the evolution of mole-rats - such as the insulin and hypoxia response pathways. Third, we report non-orthologous regulatory elements overlap with lineage-specific repetitive elements and appear to modify metabolic pathways by rewiring of HNF4 and RAR/RXR transcription factor binding sites in mole-rats.\n\nThese comparative analyses reveal how mole-rat regulatory evolution informs previously reported phenotypic adaptations. Moreover, the phylogenetic modeling framework we propose here improves upon the state-of-the-art by addressing known limitations of inter-species comparisons of epigenomic profiles, and has broad implications in the field of comparative functional genomics.",

    "abstract": "Occams razor is the principle that, all else being equal, simpler explanations should be preferred over more complex ones. This principle is thought to play a role in human perception and decision-making, but the nature of our presumed preference for simplicity is not understood. Here we use preregistered behavioral experiments informed by formal theories of statistical model selection to show that, when faced with uncertain evidence, human subjects exhibit preferences for particular, theoretically grounded forms of simplicity of the alternative explanations. These forms of simplicity can be understood in terms of geometrical features of statistical models treated as manifolds in the space of the probability distributions, in particular their dimensionality, boundaries, volume, and curvature. The simplicity preferences driven by these features, which are also exhibited by artificial neural networks trained to optimize performance on comparable tasks, generally improve decision accuracy, because they minimize over-sensitivity to noisy observations (i.e., overfitting). However, unlike for artificial networks, for human subjects these preferences persist even when they are maladaptive with respect to the task training and instructions. Thus, these preferences are not simply transient optimizations for particular task conditions but rather a more general feature of human decision-making. Taken together, our results imply that principled notions of statistical model complexity have direct, quantitative relevance to human and machine decision-making and establish a new understanding of the computational foundations, and behavioral benefits, of our predilection for inferring simplicity in the latent properties of our complex world.",
