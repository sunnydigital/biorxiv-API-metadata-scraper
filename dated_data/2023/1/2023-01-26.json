    "abstract": "The iron-oxidizing Gallionellaceae drive a wide variety of biogeochemical cycles through their metabolisms and biominerals. To better understand the environmental impacts of Gallionellaceae, we need to improve our knowledge of their diversity and metabolisms, especially any novel iron oxidation mechanisms. Here, we used a pangenomic analysis of 103 genomes to resolve Gallionellaceae phylogeny and explore the range of genomic potential. Using a concatenated ribosomal protein tree and key gene patterns, we determined Gallionellaceae has four genera, divided into two groups-iron-oxidizing bacteria (FeOB) Gallionella, Sideroxydans, and Ferriphaselus with known iron oxidases (Cyc2, MtoA) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) Candidatus Nitrotoga with nitrite oxidase (Nxr). The FeOB and NOB have similar electron transport chains, including genes for reverse electron transport and carbon fixation. Auxiliary energy metabolisms including S oxidation, denitrification, and organotrophy were scattered throughout the Gallionellaceae FeOB. Within FeOB, we found genes that may represent adaptations for iron oxidation, including a variety of extracellular electron uptake (EEU) mechanisms. FeOB genomes encoded more predicted c-type cytochromes overall, notably more multiheme c-type cytochromes (MHCs) with >10 CXXCH motifs. These include homologs of several predicted outer membrane porin-MHC complexes, including MtoAB and Uet. MHCs are known to efficiently conduct electrons across longer distances and function across a wide range of redox potentials that overlap with mineral redox potentials, which can help expand the range of usable iron substrates. Overall, the results of pangenome analyses suggest that the Gallionellaceae genera Gallionella, Sideroxydans, and Ferriphaselus are primarily iron oxidizers, capable of oxidizing dissolved Fe2+ as well as a range of solid iron or other mineral substrates.\n\nImportanceNeutrophilic iron-oxidizing bacteria (FeOB) produce copious iron (oxyhydr)oxides that can profoundly influence biogeochemical cycles, notably the fate of carbon and many metals. To fully understand environmental microbial iron oxidation, we need a thorough accounting of iron oxidation mechanisms. In this study we show the Gallionellaceae FeOB have both known iron oxidases as well as uncharacterized multiheme cytochromes (MHCs). MHCs are predicted to transfer electrons from extracellular substrates and likely confer metabolic capabilities that help Gallionellaceae occupy a range of different iron- and mineral-rich niches. Gallionellaceae appear to specialize in iron oxidation, so it makes sense that they would have multiple mechanisms to oxidize various forms of iron, given the many iron minerals on Earth, as well as the physiological and kinetic challenges faced by FeOB. The multiple iron/mineral oxidation mechanisms may help drive the widespread ecological success of Gallionellaceae.",

    "abstract": "Phages, or viruses that infect bacteria and archaea, are ubiquitous and abundant members of Earths ecosystems that impact the flow of nutrients, evolution of microbes, and food web dynamics by selectively infecting and killing their prokaryotic hosts. Because phages can only replicate through their hosts, they are inherently linked to processes impacting their hosts distribution and susceptibility to infection. Despite these links, phages can also be affected by environmental parameters independent of their hosts, such as pH or salinity which impact cell adsorption or virion degradation. To understand these complex links, in this study, we leverage the unique ecological context of the Isthmus of Panama, which narrowly disconnects the productive Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP) and Tropical Western Atlantic (TWA) provinces and compare factors that shape active marine phage and prokaryotic communities. Metagenomic sequencing of seawater from mangroves and reefs of both the TEP and TWA coasts of Panama suggest that pronounced environmental gradients, such as along the TEP mangrove rivers, result in common dispersal and physicochemical parameters shaping both prokaryotic and phage community composition and diversity. Conversely, we find that when environmental conditions are relatively similar across adjacent habitats, such as between the mangroves and reefs in the TWA, prokaryotic communities are more influenced by local abiotic conditions while phage communities are shaped more by dispersal. Collectively, this work provides a framework for addressing the co-variability between viruses and their hosts in marine systems and for identifying the different factors that drive consistent versus disparate trends in community shifts, which is essential to inform models of these interactions in biogeochemical cycling.",

    "abstract": "The production of biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass using carbohydrate-active enzymes like cellulases is key to sustainable energy production. Understanding the adsorption mechanism of cellulases and associated binding domain proteins down to the molecular level details will help in the rational design of improved cellulases. In nature, carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) from families 17 and 28 often appear in tandem appended to the C-terminus of several endocellulases. Both CBMs are known to bind to the amorphous regions of cellulose non-competitively and show similar binding affinity towards soluble cello-oligosaccharides. Based on the available crystal structures, these CBMs may display a uni-directional binding preference towards cello-oligosaccharides (based on how the oligosaccharide was bound within the CBM binding cleft). However, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have indicated no such clear preference. Considering that most soluble oligosaccharides are not always an ideal substrate surrogate to study the binding of CBMs to the native cell wall or cell surface displayed glycans, it is critical to use alternative reagents or substrates. To experimentally assess any binding directionality of CBMs towards soluble cello-oligosaccharides, we have developed a simple solid-state depletion or pull-down binding assay. Here, we specifically orient azido-labeled carbohydrates from the reducing end to alkyne-labeled micron-sized bead surfaces, using click chemistry, to mimic insoluble cell wall surface-displayed glycans. Our results reveal that both family 17 and 28 CBMs displayed a similar binding affinity towards cellohexaose-modified beads, but not cellopentaose-modified beads, which helps rationalize previously reported crystal structure and MD data. This indicates a preferred uni-directional binding of specific CBMs and could explain their co-evolution as tandem constructs appended to endocellulases to increase amorphous cellulose substrate targeting efficiency. Overall, our proposed workflow can be easily translated to measure the affinity of glycan-binding proteins to click-chemistry based immobilized surface-displayed carbohydrates or antigens.",

    "abstract": "The interaction between the transcription factor p53 and the ubiquitin ligase MDM2 results in degradation of p53 and is well studied in cancer biology and drug development. Available sequence data suggest that both p53 and MDM2-family proteins are present across the animal kingdom. However, the interacting regions are missing in some animal groups, and it is not clear whether MDM2 interacts with, and regulates p53 in all species. We used phylogenetic analyses and biophysical measurements to examine the evolution of affinity between the interacting protein regions: a conserved 12-residue intrinsically disordered binding motif in the p53 transactivation domain (TAD) and the folded SWIB domain of MDM2. The affinity varied significantly across the animal kingdom. The p53TAD/MDM2 interaction among jawed vertebrates displayed high affinity, in particular for chicken and human proteins (KD around 0.1 M). The affinity of the bay mussel p53TAD/MDM2 complex was lower (KD = 15 M) and those from a placozoan, an arthropod and a jawless vertebrate were very low or non-detectable (KD > 100 M). Binding experiments with reconstructed ancestral p53TAD/MDM2 variants suggested that a micromolar affinity interaction was present in the ancestral bilaterian animal and was later enhanced in tetrapods while lost in other linages. The different evolutionary trajectories of p53TAD/MDM2 affinity during speciation demonstrate high plasticity of motif-mediated interactions and the potential for rapid adaptation of p53 regulation during times of change. Neutral drift in unconstrained disordered regions may underlie the plasticity and explain the observed low sequence conservation in transactivation domains such as p53TAD.\n\nStatement for broader audienceThe protein p53 regulates central cellular processes including cell division and programmed cell death. p53 is regulated by another protein, MDM2, which binds to p53 and marks it for destruction. We measured the interaction between present-day and reconstructed ancient p53 and MDM2 proteins and found a range of binding strengths. Our findings suggest that rapid evolution of the p53/MDM2 interaction facilitates adaptation of p53 regulation during speciation.",

    "abstract": "HUWE1 is a large, enigmatic HECT domain ubiquitin ligase implicated in the regulation of diverse pathways including DNA repair, apoptosis, and differentiation. How HUWE1 engages its structurally diverse substrates and how HUWE1 activity is regulated are unknown. Using unbiased quantitative proteomics, we identify C16orf72/HAPSTR1 as a dedicated HUWE1 substrate despite HUWE1 targeting substrates in a largely cell type-specific manner. The established physical and genetic interactions between HUWE1 and C16orf72/HAPSTR1 suggest that HAPSTR1 positively regulates HUWE1 function. Here, we show that HAPSTR1 is both a HUWE1 substrate and is required for HUWE1 nuclear localization to facilitate HUWE1 nuclear substrate targeting. HUWE1 or HAPSTR1 loss of function triggers a broad transcriptional stress response. We show that nuclear HUWE1 is both critical for modulating stress signaling pathways, which include p53 and NF-{kappa}B-mediated signaling and required for cell proliferation. Combined, our results define a role for HAPSTR1 in gating critical nuclear HUWE1 functions.",

    "abstract": "The glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors (GR and MR, respectively) have distinct, yet overlapping physiological and pathophysiological functions. There are indications that both receptors interact functionally and physically, but the precise role of this interdependence is poorly understood. Here, we analyzed the impact of GR co-expression on MR genome-wide chromatin binding and transcriptional responses to aldosterone and glucocorticoids, both physiological ligands of this receptor. Our data show that GR co-expression alters MR genome-wide binding to consensus DNA sequences in a locus-and ligand-specific way. MR binding to consensus DNA sequences is affected by GR. Transcriptional responses of MR in the absence of GR are weak and show poor correlation with chromatin binding. In contrast, co-expression of GR potentiates MR-mediated transcription, particularly in response to aldosterone. Finally, single-molecule tracking of MR suggests that the presence of GR contributes to productive binding of MR/aldosterone complexes to chromatin. Together, our data indicate that co-expression of GR potentiates aldosterone-mediated MR transcriptional activity, even in the absence of glucocorticoids.",

To address this, we performed single-cell lineage tracing and transcriptional profiling of patient cells isolated from metaplastic and healthy tissue. Our analysis revealed discrete lineages in Barretts esophagus, normal esophagus, and gastric cardia. Transitional basal progenitor cells of the gastroesophageal junction were unexpectedly related to both esophagus and gastric cardia cells. Barretts esophagus was polyclonal, with lineages that contained all progenitor and differentiated cell types. In contrast, precancerous dysplastic foci were initiated by the expansion of a single molecularly aberrant Barretts esophagus clone.

    "abstract": "Recently, genomic selection, that is, selection based on the genetic ability predicted by genome-wide markers, has begun to contribute to rapid and efficient plant breeding. The speed and efficiency of breeding depend not only on the accuracy of genomic selection, but also on decisions regarding selection and crossing, which have a significant impact on the ultimate genetic gain of a breeding program. However, methods for optimizing these decisions have not yet been fully established. This paper proposes a data-scientific framework for optimizing decisions via numerical black-box optimization. The allocation of progenies to each mating pair was parameterized according to a softmax function of multiple selection criteria. Different selection criteria are weighted in the function to optimally balance genetic gains and genetic diversity. The weighting parameters were then optimized via breeding simulations. Simulation studies to evaluate the potential of the proposed method revealed that breeding based on optimized weights attained almost 10 % higher genetic gain than breeding with equal allocation of progenies to all mating pairs. These results suggest that the proposed method can significantly improve the speed and efficiency of breeding through optimized decisions regarding selection and crossing.",

    "abstract": "Bloom syndrome helicase (BLM) is a RecQ-family helicase implicated in a variety of cellular processes, including DNA replication, DNA repair, and telomere maintenance. Mutations in human BLM cause Bloom syndrome (BS), an autosomal recessive disorder that leads to myriad negative health impacts including a predisposition to cancer. BS-causing mutations in BLM often negatively impact BLM ATPase and helicase activity. While BLM mutations that cause BS have been well characterized both in vitro and in vivo, there are other less studied BLM mutations that exist in the human population that do not lead to BS. Two of these non-BS mutations, encoding BLM P868L and BLM G1120R, when homozygous, increase sister chromatid exchanges in human cells. To characterize these naturally occurring BLM mutant proteins in vitro, we purified the BLM catalytic core (BLMcore, residues 636-1298) with either the P868L or G1120R substitution. We also purified a BLMcore K869A K870A mutant protein, which alters a lysine-rich loop proximal to the P868 residue. We found that BLMcore P868L and G1120R proteins were both able to hydrolyze ATP, bind diverse DNA substrates, and unwind G-quadruplex and duplex DNA structures. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the P868L substitution weakens the DNA interaction with the winged-helix domain of BLM and alters the orientation of one lobe of the ATPase domain. Because BLMcore P868L and G1120R retain helicase function in vitro, it is likely that the increased genome instability is caused by specific impacts of the mutant proteins in vivo. Interestingly, we found that BLMcore K869A K870A has diminished ATPase activity, weakened binding to duplex DNA structures, and less robust helicase activity compared to wild-type BLMcore. Thus, the lysine-rich loop may have an important role in ATPase activity and specific binding and DNA unwinding functions in BLM.",

    "abstract": "In the epithelium, cell density and cell proliferation are closely connected to each other through contact inhibition of proliferation (CIP). Depending on cell density, CIP proceeds through three distinct stages, namely the free-growing stage at low density, the pre-epithelial transition stage at medium density, and the post-epithelial transition stage at high density. Previous studies have elucidated how cell morphology, motion, and mechanics vary in these stages. However, it remains unknown whether cellular metabolism also has a density-dependent behavior. By measuring the mitochondrial membrane potential at different cell densities, here we reveal a heterogeneous landscape of metabolism in the epithelium, which appears qualitatively distinct in three stages of CIP. Moreover, it did not follow the trend of other CIP-associated parameters, which increase or decrease monotonically with increasing cell density. Importantly, epithelial cells established a collective heterogeneity in mitochondrial potential exclusively in the pre-epithelial transition stage, where the multicellular clusters of high and low-potential cells emerged. However, in the post-epithelial transition stage, the potential field became relatively homogeneous. The collective metabolic heterogeneity in the pre-epithelial transition stage was independent of the mitochondrial content and spatially correlated with the local cell density. Next, to study the underlying dynamics, we constructed a system-biological model, which predicted the role of cell proliferation in metabolic potential towards establishing collective heterogeneity. Further experiments revealed that the metabolic pattern indeed spatially correlated with the proliferative capacity of cells, as measured by the nuclear localization of a pro-proliferation protein, YAP. Finally, experiments perturbing the actomyosin contractility revealed that while metabolic heterogeneity was maintained in absence of actomyosin contractility, its ab initio emergence depended on the latter. Taken together, our results revealed a density-dependent collective heterogeneity in the metabolic field of a pre-epitheli al transition stage epithelial monolayer, which may have significant implications for epithelial form and function.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEEpithelial contact inhibition of proliferation (CIP) plays a key role in tissue homeostasis, morphogenesis, and development. The biochemical changes in cells during different stages of CIP are not as well-documented as the biophysical changes. We unveil a heterogeneous landscape of metabolism which appears distinct in different stages of CIP. Importantly, in the pre-epithelial transition stage, the epithelial cells establish a collective metabolic heterogeneity wherein multicellular clusters of high and low-potential cells emerge, despite the uniform genetic and nutrient conditions for the cells. The collective heterogeneity is correlated to the local fluctuations in geometrical parameters and the proliferative capacity of cells. Finally, we demonstrate the role of cell mechanics in the establishment of collective heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial actin MreB forms filaments in which the unit of the structure is an antiparallel double strand. The wall-less helical bacterium Spiroplasma has five MreB homologs (MreB1-5), a part of which is composed of an intra-cellular ribbon for driving its swimming motility. The interaction modes of each ribbon component are unclear, although these are clues for understanding Spiroplasma swimming. Here, we examined the assembly properties of Spiroplasma eriocheiris MreB5 (SpeMreB5), which forms sheets and is a component protein of the ribbon. Electron microscopy (EM) revealed that sheet formation was inhibited under acidic conditions and paracrystal structures were formed under acidic and neutral conditions with low ionic strength. Solution assays found four properties of paracrystals as follows: (I) their formation followed sheet formation, (II) electrostatic interactions were required for their formation, (III) the positively charged and unstructured C-terminal region contributed to the nucleation of their formation, and (IV) their formation required Mg2+ at neutral pH but was inhibited by divalent cations under acidic conditions. During these studies, we found two aggregation modes of SpeMreB5, with distinct responses to ATP. These properties will shed light on SpeMreB5 assembly dynamics at the molecular level.",

    "abstract": "While fundamentally important, the intracellular diffusion of small (<~1 kDa) solutes has been difficult to elucidate due to challenges in both labeling and measurement. Here we quantify and spatially map the translational diffusion patterns of small solutes in mammalian cells by integrating several recent advances. In particular, by executing tandem stroboscopic illumination pulses down to 400-s separation, we extend single-molecule displacement/diffusivity mapping (SMdM), a super-resolution diffusion quantification tool, to small solutes with high diffusion coefficients D of >300 m2/s. We thus show that for multiple water-soluble dyes and dye-tagged nucleotides, intracellular diffusion is dominated by vast regions of high diffusivity ~60-70% of that in vitro, up to ~250 m2/s in the fastest cases. Meanwhile, we also visualize sub-micrometer foci of substantial slowdowns in diffusion, thus underscoring the importance of spatially resolving the local diffusion behavior. Together, these results suggest that the intracellular diffusion of small solutes is only modestly scaled down by the slightly higher viscosity of the cytosol over water, but otherwise not further hindered by macromolecular crowding. We thus lift a paradoxically low speed limit for intracellular diffusion suggested by previous experiments.\n\nAbstract Graphic O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

Precursor proteins containing targeting sequences are recognized by the TOM complex and imported into the mitochondria. We have determined the structure of the TOM core complex from Neurospora crassa by single-particle cryoEM at 3.3 [A] resolution, showing its interaction with a bound presequence at 4 [A] resolution, and of the TOM holo complex including the Tom20 receptor at 6-7 [A] resolution. TOM is a transmembrane complex consisting of two {beta}-barrels, three receptor subunits and three short transmembrane subunits. Tom20 has a transmembrane helix and a receptor domain on the cytoplasmic side. We propose that Tom20 acts as a dynamic gatekeeper, guiding precursor proteins into the pores of the TOM complex. We analyze the interactions of Tom20 with other TOM subunits, present insights into the structure of the TOM holo complex, and suggest a translocation mechanism.",

We thus show that the diffusion coefficients D in both organelles are ~40% of that in the cytoplasm, with the latter exhibiting higher spatial inhomogeneities. Moreover, we unveil that diffusions in the ER lumen and the mitochondrial matrix are markedly impeded when the FP is given positive, but not negative, net charges. Calculation shows most intraorganellar proteins as negatively charged, thus a mechanism to impede the diffusion of positively charged proteins. However, we further identify the ER protein PPIB as an exception with a positive net charge, and experimentally show that the removal of this positive charge elevates its intra-ER diffusivity. We thus unveil a sign-asymmetric protein charge effect on the nanoscale intraorganellar diffusion.",

Here, we report a CRISPRi/a screening platform to systematically interrogate the contribution of specific nutrient transporters to support cancer cell proliferation in environments ranging from standard culture media to tumor models. We applied this platform to identify the transporters of amino acids in leukemia cells and found that amino acid transport is characterized by high bidirectional flux that is dependent on the composition of the microenvironment. While investigating the role of transporters in cystine starved cells, we uncovered a novel role for serotonin uptake in preventing ferroptosis. Finally, we identified transporters essential for cell proliferation in subcutaneous tumors and found that levels of glucose and amino acids can restrain proliferation in that environment. This study provides a framework for the systematic identification of critical cellular nutrient transporters, characterizing the function of such transporters, and studying how the tumor microenvironment impacts cancer metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Plants need to integrate internal and environmental signals to mount adequate stress responses. The NUCLEAR PORE COMPLEX (NPC) component HIGH EXPRESSION OF OSMOTICALLY RESPONSIVE GENES 1 (HOS1) is emerging as such an integrator, affecting responses to cold, heat, light and salinity. Stress conditions often converge in a low-energy signal that activates SUCROSE NON-FERMENTING 1-RELATED KINASE 1 (SnRK1) to promote stress tolerance and survival. Here, we explored the role of HOS1 in the SnRK1-dependent response to low-energy stress in Arabidopsis thaliana, using darkness as a treatment and a combination of genetic, biochemical and phenotypic assays. We show that the induction of starvation genes and plant tolerance to prolonged darkness are defective in the hos1 mutant. HOS1 interacts physically with the SnRK11 catalytic subunit in yeast-two-hybrid and in planta, and the nuclear accumulation of SnRK11 is reduced in the hos1 mutant. Likewise, another NPC mutant, nup160, exhibits lower activation of starvation genes and decreased tolerance to prolonged darkness. Importantly, defects in low-energy responses in the hos1 background are rescued by fusing SnRK11 to a potent nuclear localization signal, or by sugar supplementation during the dark treatment. Altogether, this work demonstrates the importance of HOS1 for the nuclear accumulation of SnRK11, which is key for plant tolerance to low-energy conditions.",

    "abstract": "Bovine cysticercosis is an infection of cattle caused by the larval stage of Cysticercus Bovis, the human intestinal cestodes and it has economic important and public health importance. Across-sectional study was conducted from March 2022 to August 2022 to determine the prevalence of Bovine Cysticercosis, Human Taeniasis and associated risk factors in selected towns of Silte zone. The study was conducted in Silte zone municipal abbatoir, Southern Ethiopia in cattle slaughtered randomly selected towns,namely, at Kilto,Kutery,Kirate and Werabe Tawon municipal abattoirs. Systematic random sampling technique was used to collect all the necessary data from abattoir survey of the study animals and questionnaire survey collected data stored by using in Epi data software and analyzed using (SPSS-22) software program. The sample size required for this study was determined to be based on the expected prevalence (50%) of C. bovis and the 5% desired absolute precision and 95% CI. Out of 422 carcasses examined during the study period in 4 municipality abattoirs, 36 % were infected with C.bovis. A prevalence of 35.7%, 35.92%, 37.96% and 34.11% were Kilto,Kutery,Kirate and Werabe Tawon were observed, respectively. Among considered risk factors, sex, body condition and breed showed statistically significant difference in prevalence of C. bovis in study area. Regarding the anatomical distribution of the cysts, shoulder muscle showed highest prevalence 28.44%, was followed by tongue 20.79% tricepsbrachi muscle 18.35%, masseter muscle 17.74%, heart 12.84%, and Liver 1.8%. Out of 110 respondents, 64.5% had contracted T.saginata. Among considered risk factors, sex, age, occupation, education status, raw meat consumption and knowledge about the disease showed statistically significant difference in prevalence of T.saginata in study area. The findings of this study indicated that importance of Bovine Cysticercosis and Taeniasis in the study area. Therefore, attention should be given to the public awareness, detailed meat inspection to be safe to public health, consumption of well-cooked cattle meat should be implemented for breaking the cycle of the diseases and promote meat industry in the country.",

    "abstract": "Parasites, especially brain-encysting trematodes, can have an impact on host behaviour, facilitating the transmission to next host and completion of the life cycle, but insufficient research has been done on whether specific brain regions are targeted. Using the laboratory model Cardiocephaloides longicollis, the precise distribution of metacercariae in experimentally-infected, wild and farmed fish was mapped. The brain regions targeted by this parasite were explored, also from a histologic perspective, and potential pathologic effects were evaluated. Experimental infections allowed to reproduce the natural infection intensity of C. longicollis, with four times higher infection intensity at the higher dose (150 vs 50 cercariae). The observed metacercarial distribution, similar among all fish groups, may reflect a species-specific pattern. Metacercariae occur with highest density in the optic lobe area (primarily infect the periventricular gray zone of optic tectum) and the medulla oblongata, whereas other areas such as the olfactory lobes and cerebellar lobes may be occupied when the more frequently invaded parts of the brain were crowded. Mono- and multicysts (i.e. formed either with a single metacercaria, or with 2 25 metacercariae encapsulated together) may be formed depending on the aggregation and timing of metacercariae arrival, with minor host inflammatory response. Larvae of C. longicollis colonizing specific brain areas may have an effect on the functions associated with these areas, which are generally related to sensory and motor functions, but are also related to other host fitness traits such as school maintenance or recognition of predators. The detailed information on the extent and distribution of C. longicollis in fish encephalon sets the ground to understand the effects of brain parasites on fish, but further investigation to establish if C. longicollis, through purely mechanical damage (e.g., occupation, pressure and displacement), has an actual impact on host behaviour remains to be tested under controlled experimental conditions.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic inflammatory diseases in which abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and fatigue collectively result in diminished quality of patient life. The disappearance of intestinal helminth infections in Western societies is associated with an increased prevalence of IBD and other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. Evidence indicates that helminths induce tolerogenic dendritic cells (tolDCs), which promote intestinal tolerance and attenuate intestinal inflammation characteristic of IBD, but the exact mechanism is unclear. Helminth-derived excretory-secretory (HES) products including macromolecules, proteins, and polysaccharides have been shown to modulate the antigen presenting function of DCs with down-stream effects on effector CD4+ T cells. Previous studies indicate that DCs in helminth-infected animals induce tolerance to unrelated antigens and DCs exposed to HES display phenotypic and functional features of tolDCs. Here, we identify that nonpolar metabolites (HnpM) produced by a helminth, the murine gastrointestinal nematode Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri (Hpb), induce tolDCs as evidenced by decreased LPS-induced TNF and increased IL-10 secretion and reduced expression of MHC-II, CD86, and CD40. Furthermore, these DCs inhibited OVA-specific CD4+ T cell proliferation and induced CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Adoptive transfer of HnpM-induced tolDCs attenuated DSS-induced intestinal inflammation characteristic of IBD. Mechanistically, HnpM induced metabolic and transcriptional signatures in BMDCs consistent with tolDCs. Collectively, our findings provide groundwork for further investigation into novel mechanisms regulating DC tolerance and the role of helminth secreted metabolites in attenuating intestinal inflammation associated with IBD.\n\nSummary SentenceMetabolites produced by Heligmosomoides polygyrus induce metabolic and transcriptional changes in DCs consistent with tolDCs, and adoptive transfer of these DCs attenuated DSS-induced intestinal inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Foot-and-mouth disease affects cloven hoofed animals and is caused by foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), a picornavirus with a positive-sense RNA genome. The FMDV genome contains a single open reading frame, which is translated to produce a polyprotein that is cleaved by viral proteases to produce the viral structural and non-structural proteins. Initial processing of the polyprotein occurs at three main junctions to generate four primary products; Lpro and the P1, P2 and P3 precursors (also termed 1ABCD, 2BC and 3AB1,2,3CD). The 2BC and 3AB1,2,3CD precursors undergo subsequent proteolysis to generate non-structural proteins that are required for viral replication, including the enzymes 2C, 3Cpro and 3Dpol. These precursors can be processed through both cis and trans (i.e., intra- and inter-molecular proteolysis) pathways, which are thought to be important for controlling virus replication. Our previous studies suggested that a single residue in the 3B3-3C junction had an important role in controlling 3AB1,2,3CD processing. Here, we use in vitro based assays to show that a single point mutation at the 3B3-3C boundary increases the rate of proteolysis to generate a novel 2C-containing precursor. Complementation assays showed that while this point mutation permitted production of some non-enzymatic non-structural proteins, those with enzymatic functions were inhibited. Interestingly, replication could only be supported by complementation with mutations in cis acting RNA elements, providing genetic evidence for a functional interaction between replication enzymes and RNA elements.\n\nImportanceFoot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is an economically important pathogen of animals that is responsible for foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). FMD is endemic in many parts of the world and can results in major economic losses. Replication of the virus is a highly coordinated event that occurs within membrane-associated compartments in infected cells and requires the viral non-structural proteins. These are all initially produced as a polyprotein that undergoes proteolysis likely through both cis and trans pathways (i.e., intra- and inter-molecular proteolysis). Alternative processing pathways can provide a mechanism to help coordinate viral replication by providing temporal control to protein production. Here, we analyse the consequences of mutations that change temporal control of FMDV polyprotein processing. Our data suggests that correct processing is required to produce key enzymes for replication in an environment in which they can interact with essential viral RNA elements. These data further the understanding of FMDV genome replication.",

Here, using primary forebrain murine neurons, we demonstrate that stimulating neurons by sustained depolarization rapidly induced two-fold transcriptional up-regulation of Cdr1as and strong post-transcriptional stabilization of miR-7. Cdr1as loss caused doubling of glutamate release from stimulated synapses and increased frequency and duration of local neuronal bursts. Moreover, periodicity of neuronal networks was increased and synchronicity was impaired. Strikingly, these effects were reverted by sustained expression of miR-7 which also cleared Cdr1as molecules from neuronal projections. Consistently, without Cdr1as, transcriptomic changes caused by miR-7 overexpression were stronger (including miR-7-targets down-regulation) and enriched in secretion/synaptic plasticity pathways. Altogether, our results suggest that in forebrain neurons Cdr1as buffers miR-7 activity to control glutamatergic excitatory transmission and neuronal connectivity important for long-lasting synaptic adaptations.",

    "abstract": "Histone deacetylase complexes remove histone lysine acetylation, a key post-translational modification that activates transcription at each gene. Although these complexes are drug targets and crucial regulators of organismal physiology, their structure and mechanisms of action are largely unclear. Here, we present the first structure of a complete human SIN3B histone deacetylase holo-complex with and without a substrate mimic. Remarkably, SIN3B encircles the deacetylase and contacts its allosteric basic patch thereby stimulating catalysis. A SIN3B loop inserts into the catalytic tunnel, rearranges to accommodate the acetyl-lysine moiety and stabilises the substrate for specific deacetylation, which is guided by a substrate receptor subunit. Our findings provide a model of specificity for a main transcriptional regulator conserved from yeast to human and a resource of protein-protein interactions for future drug designs.",

    "abstract": "Histones are the principal constituents of chromatin in eukaryotes and most archaea, while bacteria generally rely on an orthogonal set of proteins to organize their chromosomes. However, several bacterial genomes encode proteins with putative histone fold domains. Whether these proteins are structurally and functionally equivalent to archaeal and eukaryotic histones is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that histones are essential and are major components of chromatin in the bacteria Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus and Leptospira interrogans. Patterns of sequence evolution suggest important roles in several additional bacterial clades. Structural analysis of the B. bacteriovorus histone (Bd0055) dimer shows that histone fold topology is conserved between bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. Yet, unexpectedly, Bd0055 binds DNA end-on and forms a sheath of tightly packed histone dimers to encase straight DNA. This binding mode is in stark contrast to archaeal, eukaryotic, and viral histones, which invariably bend and wrap DNA around their outer surface. Our results demonstrate that histones are integral chromatin components across the tree of life and highlight organizational innovation in the domain Bacteria.",

    "abstract": "As the majority of environmental microbial organisms still evade cultivation attempts, genomic insights into many taxa are limited to cultivation-independent approaches. However, current methods of metagenomic binning and single cell genome sequencing have individual drawbacks, which can limit the quality as well as completeness of the reconstructed genomes. Current attempts to combine both approaches still use whole genome amplification techniques which are known to be prone to bias. Here we propose a novel approach for the purpose of metagenomic genome reconstructions, that utilizes the potential of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for targeted enrichment and depletion of different cell types to create distinct cell fractions of sufficient size circumvent amplification. By distributing sequencing efforts over these fractions as well as the original sample, co-assemblies become highly optimized for co-abundance variation based binning approaches. \"Midi-metagenomics\" enables accurate metagenome assembled genome (MAG) reconstruction from individual sorted samples with higher quality than co-assembly of multiple distinct samples and has potential for the targeted enrichment and sequencing of uncultivated organism of interest.",

    "abstract": "The Escherichia coli ribosome can incorporate a variety of non-O_SCPLOWLC_SCPLOW--amino acid monomers into polypeptide chains, but with poor efficiency. Although these monomers span a diverse set of compounds, there exists no high-resolution structural information regarding their positioning within the catalytic center of the ribosome, the peptidyl transferase center (PTC). Thus, details regarding the mechanism of amide bond formation and the structural basis for differences and defects in incorporation efficiency remain unknown. Within a set of three aminobenzoic acid derivatives-3-aminopyridine-4-carboxylic acid (Apy), ortho-aminobenzoic acid (oABZ), and meta-aminobenzoic acid (mABZ)-the ribosome incorporates Apy into polypeptide chains with the highest efficiency, followed by oABZ and then mABZ, a trend that does not track with the nucleophilicity of the reactive amines. Here, we report high resolution cryo-EM structures of the ribosome with these three aminobenzoic acid derivatives charged on tRNA bound in the aminoacyl-tRNA site (A site). These structures reveal how the aromatic ring of each monomer sterically blocks positioning of nucleotide U2506, thereby preventing rearrangement of nucleotide U2585 and the resulting induced fit in the PTC required for efficient amide bond formation. They also reveal disruptions to the \"proton wire\" responsible for facilitating formation and breakdown of the tetrahedral intermediate. Together, the cryo-EM structures reported here provide a clear rationale for differences in reactivity of aminobenzoic acid derivatives relative to O_SCPLOWLC_SCPLOW--amino acids and each other, and point to stereochemical constraints on the size and geometry of non-proteinogenic monomers that can be accepted efficiently by wild-type ribosomes.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe evolutionary implications and frequency of hybridization and introgression are increasingly being recognized across the tree of life. To detect hybridization from multi-locus and genome-wide sequence data, a popular class of methods are based on summary statistics from subsets of 3 or 4 taxa. However, these methods often carry the assumption of a constant substitution rate across lineages and genes, which is commonly broken in many groups. In this work, we quantify the effects of rate variation on the D-statistic (also known as ABBA-BABA test), the D3 statistic, and HyDe. All three tests are used widely across a range of taxonomic groups, in part because they are very fast to compute. We consider rate variation across species lineages, across genes, their lineage-by-gene interaction, and rate variation across gene-tree edges. We simulated species networks according to a birth-death-hybridization process so as to capture a range of realistic species phylogenies. For all three methods tested, we found a marked increase in the false discovery of reticulation (type-1 error rate) when there is rate variation across species lineages. The D3 statistic was the most sensitive, with around 80% type-1 error, such that D3 appears to more sensitive to a departure from the clock than to the presence of reticulation. For all three tests, the power to detect hybridization events decreased as the number of hybridization events increased, indicating that multiple hybridization events can \"hide\" one another if they occur within a small subset of taxa. Our study highlights the need to consider rate variation when using site-based summary statistics, and points to the advantages of methods that do not require assumptions on evolutionary rates across lineages or across genes.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous speech is produced in chunks called Intonation Units (IUs). IUs are defined by a set of prosodic cues and occur in all human languages. Linguistic theory suggests that IUs pace the flow of information and serve as a window onto the dynamic focus of attention in speech processing. IUs provide a promising and hitherto unexplored theoretical framework for studying the neural mechanisms of communication, thanks to their universality and their consistent temporal structure across different grammatical and socio-cultural conditions. In this article, we identify a neural response unique to the boundary defined by the IU. We measured the EEG of participants who listened to different speakers recounting an emotional life event. We analyzed the speech stimuli linguistically, and modeled the EEG response at word offset using a GLM approach. We find that the EEG response to IU-final words differs from the response to IU-nonfinal words when acoustic boundary strength is held constant. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this is demonstrated in spontaneous speech under naturalistic listening conditions, and under a theoretical framework that connects the prosodic chunking of speech, on the one hand, with the flow of information during communication, on the other. Finally, we relate our findings to the body of research on rhythmic brain mechanism in speech processing by comparing the topographical distributions of neural speech tracking in model-predicted and empirical EEG. This qualitative comparison suggests that IU-related neural activity contributes to the previously characterized delta-band neural speech tracking.",

    "abstract": "Adolescent growth spurts (GS) in body length seem to be absent in non-human primates and are considered a distinct human trait. However, this distinction between present and absent length-GSs may reflect a mathematical artefact that makes it arbitrary. We first outline how scaling issues and inappropriate comparisons between length (linear) and weight (volume) growth rates result in misleading interpretations like the absence of length-GSs in non-human primates despite pronounced weight-GSs, or temporal delays between length- and weight-GSs. We then apply a scale-corrected approach to a comprehensive dataset on 258 zoo-housed bonobos that includes weight and length growth as well as several physiological markers related to growth and adolescence. We found pronounced GSs in body weight and length in both sexes. Weight and length growth trajectories corresponded with each other and with patterns of testosterone and IGFBP-3 levels, resembling adolescent GSs in humans. We further re-interpreted published data of non-human primates, which showed that aligned GSs in weight and length exist not only in bonobos. Altogether, our results emphasize the importance of considering scaling laws when interpreting growth curves in general, and further show that pronounced, human-like adolescent length-GSs exist in bonobos and probably also many other non-human primates.",
