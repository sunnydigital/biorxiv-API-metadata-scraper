    "abstract": "Phenotypic sexual dimorphism can be mediated by sex differences in gene expression. We examine two forms of sexual dimorphism in gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster: (i) sex-biased gene expression (SBGE) in which the sexes differ in the amount a gene is expressed and (ii) sexual dimorphism in isoform usage, i.e., sex-specific splicing (SSS). In whole body (but not head) expression, we find a negative association between SBGE and SSS, possibly suggesting these are alternate routes to resolving sexual antagonistic selection. Next, we evaluate whether expression dimorphism contributes to the heterogeneity among genes in rmf, the intersexual genetic correlation in body expression that constrains the extent to which a genes expression can evolve independently between the sexes. We find lower rmf values for genes with than without SSS. We find higher rmf values for male- than female-biased genes (except genes with extreme male-bias), even though male-biased genes are known to have greater evolutionary divergence in expression. Finally, we examine population genetic patterns in relation to SBGE and SSS because genes with expression dimorphism have likely experienced a history of sex differences in selection. SSS is associated with reduced values of Tajimas D and elevated Direction of Selection (DoS) values, suggestive of higher rates of adaptive evolution. Though DoS is highly elevated for genes with extreme male bias, DoS otherwise tends to decline from female-biased to unbiased to male-biased genes. Collectively, the results indicate that SBGE and SSS are differentially distributed across the genome and are associated with different forms of selection.",

    "abstract": "The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected all aspects of life around the world. Neuroimaging evidence suggests the novel coronavirus can attack the central nervous system (CNS), causing cerebro-vascular abnormalities in the brain. This can lead to focal changes in cerebral blood flow and metabolic oxygen consumption rate in the brain. However, the extent and spatial locations of brain alterations in COVID-19 survivors are largely unknown. In this study, we have assessed brain functional connectivity (FC) using resting-state functional MRI (RS-fMRI) in 38 (25 males) COVID patients two weeks after hospital discharge, when PCR negative and 31 (24 males) healthy subjects. FC was estimated using independent component analysis (ICA) and dual regression. When compared to the healthy group, the COVID group demonstrated significantly enhanced FC in the basal ganglia and precuneus networks (family wise error (fwe) corrected, pfwe < 0.05), while, on the other hand, reduced FC in the language network (pfwe < 0.05). The COVID group also experienced higher fatigue levels during work, compared to the healthy group (p < 0.001). Moreover, within the precuneus network, we noticed a significant negative correlation between FC and fatigue scores across groups (Spearmans {rho} = - 0.47, p = 0.001, r2 = 0.22). Interestingly, this relationship was found to be significantly stronger among COVID survivors within the left parietal lobe, which is known to be structurally and functionally associated with fatigue in other neurological disorders.\n\nSignificance StatementEarly neuroimaging studies have mostly focused on structural MRI imaging to report brain abnormalities in acutely ill COVID-19 patients. It is not clear whether functional abnormalities co-exist with structural alterations in patients who have survived the infection and have been discharged from the hospital. A few recent studies have emerged which attempted to address the structural/functional alterations. However, further investigations across different sites are necessary for more conclusive inference. More importantly, fatigue is a highly prevalent symptom among COVID survivors, therefore, the relations of brain imaging abnormalities to fatigue should be investigated. In this study, we try to address these gaps, by collecting imaging data from COVID survivors, now PCR negative, and healthy subjects from a single site - the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi, India. Furthermore, this is a continuation of an ongoing study. We have recently shown structural abnormalities and stronger gray matter volume (GMV) correlates of self-reported fatigue in this group of COVID survivors compared to healthy subjects (Hafiz et al., 2022).",

    "abstract": "Psilocybin, and its active metabolite psilocin, have been shown to elicit rapid and long-lasting symptom improvements in a variety of affective psychiatric illnesses. However, the region-specific alterations underlying these therapeutic effects remain relatively unknown. The central amygdala (CeA) is a primary output region within the extended amygdala that is dysregulated in affective psychiatric disorders. Here, we measured CeA activity using the activity marker c-Fos and CeA reactivity using fiber photometry paired with an aversive air-puff stimulus. We found that psilocin administration acutely increased CeA activity in both males and females and increased stimulus specific CeA reactivity in females, but not males. In contrast, psilocin produced time-dependent decreases in reactivity in males, but not females as early as 2-days and lasting to 28-days post administration. We also measured behavioral responses to the air-puff stimulus and found sex-dependent changes in threat responding but not exploratory behavior or general locomotion. Repeated presentations of the auditory component of the air-puff were also performed and sex-specific effects of psilocin on CeA reactivity to the auditory-alone stimulus were also observed. This study provides new evidence that a single dose of psilocin produces sex-specific, time-dependent, and enduring changes in CeA reactivity and behavioral responding to specific components of an aversive stimulus.",

    "abstract": "BRCA1/BARD1 is a tumor suppressor E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase with roles in DNA damage repair and in transcriptional regulation. BRCA1/BARD1 RING domains interact with nucleosomes to facilitate mono-ubiquitylation of distinct residues on the C-terminal tail of histone H2A. These enzymatic domains constitute a small fraction of the heterodimer, raising the possibility of functional chromatin interactions involving other regions such as the BARD1 C-terminal domains that bind nucleosomes containing the DNA damage signal H2A K15-Ub and H4 K20me0, or portions of the expansive intrinsically disordered regions found in both subunits. Herein, we reveal novel interactions that support robust H2A ubiquitylation activity mediated through a high-affinity, intrinsically disordered DNA-binding region of BARD1. These interactions support BRCA1/BARD1 recruitment to chromatin and sites of DNA damage in cells and contribute to their survival. We also reveal distinct BRCA1/BARD1 complexes that depend on the presence of H2A K15-Ub, including a complex where a single BARD1 subunit spans adjacent nucleosome units. Our findings identify an extensive network of multivalent BARD1- nucleosome interactions that serve as a platform for BRCA1/BARD1-associated functions on chromatin.",

    "abstract": "Predictive biomarkers of functional or biological age are key for evaluating interventions aimed at increasing healthspan and, perhaps, lifespan in humans. Currently, cardiovascular performance, blood analytes, frailty indices, and DNA methylation clocks are used to provide such estimates; each technique has its own strength and limitations. We have developed a novel approach, microscopic imaging of epigenetic age (miEpiAge), which computes multiparametric signatures based on the patterns of epigenetic landscape in single nuclei. We demonstrated that such epigenetic age (EpiAge) readouts robustly distinguish young and old cells from multiple tissues and observed the emergency of epigenetic trajectories of aging using different embeddings of peripheral blood (e.g. CD3+ T cells) without linear regression or averaging. EpiAge readouts based on H3K4me1, H3K27ac, and H3K27me3 revealed distinct progression of epigenetic age in different tissues, while brain and heart were correlated (Spearman r=0.8, p=0.015), and suggested an overall slower pace of epigenetic changes in brain and kidney. Further, EpiAge readouts were consistent with expected acceleration or slowdown of biological age in chronologically identical mice treated with chemotherapy or following caloric restriction regimen, respectively. Critically, we demonstrated that miEpiAge readouts from mouse skeletal muscles correlate (Pearson r=0.92, p=5e-8) with linear combinations of circadian rhythms dependent whole organism metabolic and behavioral readouts recorded from the same mice. Because EpiAge readouts are derived from individual sample measurements without averaging or regression on chronological age, EpiAge represents a personalized biomarker. We posit that miEpiAge provides first in class approach to assess functional age in a variety of organs and tissues offering a rich collection of universal personalized biomarkers of functional age with a single cell resolution.",

    "abstract": "The increase of brain neuron number in relation with brain size is currently considered to be the major evolutionary path to high cognitive power in amniotes. However, how changes in neuron density did contribute to the evolution of the information-processing capacity of the brain remains unanswered. High neuron densities are seen as the main reason why the fovea located at the optical center of the retina is responsible for sharp vision in birds and primates. The emergence of foveal vision is considered as a breakthrough innovation in visual system evolution. We found that neuron densities in the largest visual center of the midbrain - i.e., the optic tectum - are two to four times higher in modern birds with one or two foveae compared to birds deprived of this specialty. Interspecies comparisons enabled us to identify elements of a hitherto unknown developmental process set up by foveate birds for increasing neuron density in the upper layers of their optic tectum. The late progenitor cells that generate these neurons proliferate in a ventricular zone that can expand only radially. In this particular context, the number of cells in ontogenetic columns increases, thereby setting the conditions for higher cell densities in the upper layers once neurons did migrate.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=191 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/514341v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1861345org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15b5557org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13fec7borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bea1bb_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIThe presence of a fovea is associated with increased neuron density in the optic tectum\nC_LIO_LIFovea number and deepness influence neuron density in the optic tectum\nC_LIO_LIIncreased neuron density in the upper layers of the optic tectum requires major developmental changes\nC_LIO_LIPostponed cell migration, prolonged cell proliferation, hindered tissue growth are necessary settings for achieving high neuron density\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Millions suffer from incurable lung diseases, and the donor lung shortage hampers organ transplants. Identifying the crucial lineage and the program for lung organogenesis could facilitate designing whole-lung bioengineering. Using lineage-tracing mice and human iPSC-derived lung-directed differentiation, we revealed that gastrulating Foxa2 lineage contributed to both lung mesenchyme and epithelium formation. Interestingly, Foxa2 lineage-derived cells in the lung mesenchyme progressively increased and occupied more than half of the mesenchyme niche, including endothelial cells, during lung development. Foxa2 promoter-driven, conditional Fgfr2 gene depletion caused the lung agenesis phenotype in mice. Importantly, wild-type donor mouse iPSCs injected into their blastocysts rescued this phenotype by complementing the Fgfr2-defective niche in the lung epithelium and mesenchyme. Donor cell is shown to replace the entire lung epithelial and robust mesenchymal niche during early chimeric lung development, resulting in efficient complementation of the nearly entire lung niche at the late stage of lung development. These results suggest that lung complementation based on the Foxa2 lineage is a unique model for the progressive mobilization of donor cells into both epithelial and mesenchymal lung niches and provides crucial insights for designing new bioengineering strategies to generate whole lungs.",

We study here the properties of PSDs and in particular how they can be generated by polymers. We show that increasing the number of cross-linkers generate a polymer condensation, preventing the access of diffusing molecules. To investigate how the PSDs restrict the motion of diffusing molecules, we estimate the mean residence and first escaping times. Finally, by computing the mean square displacement of single particle trajectories, we can reconstruct the properties of PSDs in term of a continuum range of anomalous exponents. To conclude, PSDs can result from a condensed chromatin, where the number of cross-linkers control the molecular access.",

    "abstract": "N6-acetyl-L-lysine residue is abundant in dietary protein but less is known about its potential influences on the diet-consumers. We herein report that KARS mediates intra- translational deposition of diet-derived N6-acetyl-L-lysine in nascent proteins to contribute the acetylome in cells. Acetylated dietary protein is a direct source of N6-acetyl-L-lysine that can widely and substantially contribute the acetylome in multiple organs of mice. By analyzing the co-crystal structure of Lysyl-tRNA synthetase (KARS) in complex with N6- acetyl-L-lysyl-AMP and pyrophosphate, together with in vitro biochemical assays, we learned that KARS can utilize N6-acetyl-L-lysine to produce N6-acetyl-L-lysyl-AMP and transfers the N6-acetyl-L-lysyl-moiety to lysine cognate tRNA to generate N6-acetyl-L- lysyl-tRNA, which introduces N6-acetyl-L-lysine into growing nascent polypeptide and intra-translationally results in protein acetylation. This undocumented protein modification mechanism is inherently different from post-translational modification (PTM) and termed as intra-translational modification (ITM). ITM can functionally mimic PTM mechanisms to deposit acetylation in histones to decondense chromatin. It can also modify PTM- inaccessible regions that are buried inside and functionally important to proteins. ITM is expected to extend the repertoire of acetylome and improve our understandings in protein modification modes in cells.",

    "abstract": "Ligand recognition by the human /{beta} T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) heterodimer protein, unlike the surface immunoglobulin (sIg) B-cell receptor, is not governed by relative binding affinity. Its interaction with the peptide (p) plus major histocompatibility complex (MHC) protein (abbrev. pMHC) likely involves some different molecular mechanism linking pMHC binding to T-cell functions. Recent analytical geometry of TCR:pMHC-II solved crystallographic structures (n = 40) revealed that each variable (V)-domain is bound in similar, yet mathematically unique orientations to its target pMHC groove. The relative position of the central cysteine of each V-domain was examined by multivariable calculus in spherical coordinates, where a simple volume element (dV) was found to describe clonotypic geometry with pMHC-II. Here, the study was expanded to include TCR:pMHC-I structures, and to model a physical mechanism, specifically involving the two directionally opposed inclined planes (IP) manifest by the two major -helices prominent in both MHC-I and MHC-II proteins. Calculations for rotational torque of each V-domain, together with acceleration up and down the slopes of both MHC -helices were used to estimate the time a given V-domain spends sliding down its cognate MHC IP. This V-domain rotation/sliding mechanism appears to be quantitatively unique for each TCR:pMHC V-domain (n = 40). However, there is an apparent and common dichotomy between the mobility of each V-domain with respect to the two classes of MHC proteins. Evolutionary motifs in the MHC helices support that the V-domains negotiate the opposed inclined planes of pMHC ligands in clonotypic fashion. Thus, this model is useful in understanding how mechanical forces are linked to TCR function.",

    "abstract": "The spermosphere is the transient, immediate zone of soil around imbibing and germinating seeds. It represents a habitat where there is contact between seed-associated microbes and soil microbes, but is studied less compared to other plant habitats. Previous studies on spermosphere microbiology were primarily culture-based or did not sample the spermosphere soil as initially defined in space and time. Thus, the objectives of this study were to develop an efficient strategy to collect spermosphere soils around imbibing soybean and cotton in non-sterile soil and investigate changes in microbial communities. The method employed sufficiently collected spermosphere soil as initially defined in space by constraining the soil sampled with a cork borer and confining the soil to a 12-well microtiter plate. Spermosphere prokaryote composition changed over time and depended on the crop within six hours after seeds were sown. By 12 to 18 hours, crops had unique microbial communities in spermosphere soils. Prokaryote evenness dropped following seed imbibition with the proliferation of copiotrophic soil bacteria. Due to their long history of plant growth promotion, prokaryote OTUs in Bacillus, Paenibacillus, Burkholderia, Massilia, Azospirillum, and Pseudomonas were notable genera enriched. Fungi and prokaryotes were hub taxa in cotton and soybean spermosphere networks. Additionally, the enriched taxa were not hubs in networks, suggesting other taxa besides those enriched may be important for spermosphere communities. Overall, this study advances knowledge in the assembly of the plant microbiome early in a plants life, which may have plant health implications in more mature plant growth stages.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial fission protein 1 (FIS1) is conserved in all eukaryotes yet its activity in metazoans is thought divergent from lower eukaryotes like fungi. To address this discrepancy, structure-based sequence alignments revealed a conserved but non-canonical, three-residue insert in a turn of FIS1, suggesting conserved activity. In vertebrate FIS1 this insert is serine (S45), lysine (K46), and tyrosine (Y47). To determine the biological role of this \"SKY insert\", three variants were evaluated for their fold, and tested in HCT116 cells for altered mitochondrial morphology and recruitment of effectors, DRP1 and TBC1D15. Substitution of the SKY insert with three alanine residues (AAA), or deletion of the insert ({Delta}SKY), did not substantially alter the fold or thermal stability of the protein. Replacing SKY with a canonical turn ({Delta}SKYD49G) introduced significant conformational heterogeneity by NMR that was removed upon deletion of a known regulatory region, the FIS1 arm. Expression of AAA fragmented mitochondria into perinuclear clumps associated with increased mitochondrial DRP1 similar to the wild-type protein. In contrast, expression of {Delta}SKY variants elongated mitochondrial networks and reduced mitochondrial DRP1. Co-expression of YFP-TBC1D15 partially rescued mitochondrial morphology and DRP1 recruitment for {Delta}SKY variants, although {Delta}SKY variants were markedly unable to support TBC1D15 assembly into punctate structures found upon co-expression with wildtype FIS1 or the AAA variant. Collectively these results show that FIS1 activity can be modulated by conserved residues supporting a generalized model whereby FIS1 is governed by intramolecular interactions between the regulatory FIS1 arm and SKY insert that may be conserved across species.",

While there is a consensus that the C-terminal tail of kinesin-1 inhibits motility, the molecular architecture of a full-length autoinhibited kinesin-1 remains unknown. Here, we combine cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS), electron microscopy (EM), and AlphaFold structure prediction to determine the architecture of the full-length autoinhibited kinesin-1 homodimer [kinesin-1 heavy chain (KHC)] and kinesin-1 heterotetramer [KHC bound to kinesin light chain 1 (KLC1)]. Our integrative analysis shows that kinesin-1 forms a compact, bent conformation through a break in coiled coil 3. Moreover, our XL-MS analysis demonstrates that kinesin light chains stabilize the folded inhibited state rather than inducing a new structural state. Using our structural model, we show that disruption of multiple interactions between the motor, stalk, and tail domains is required to activate the full-length kinesin-1. Our work offers a conceptual framework for understanding how cargo adaptors and microtubule-associated proteins relieve autoinhibition to promote activation.",

    "abstract": "The organization of the cytokinetic ring at the cell equator of dividing animal and fungi cells depends crucially on the anillin scaffold proteins. In fission yeast, anillin related Mid1 binds to the plasma membrane and helps anchor and organize a medial broad band of cytokinetic nodes, which are the precursors of the contractile ring. Similar to other anillins, Mid1 contains a C terminal globular domain with two potential regions for membrane binding, the Pleckstrin Homology (PH) and C2 domains, and an N terminal intrinsically disordered region that is strongly regulated by phosphorylation. Previous studies have shown that both PH and C2 domains can associate with the membrane, preferring phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) lipids. However, it is unclear if they can simultaneously bind to the membrane in a way that allows dimerization or oligomerization of Mid1, and if one domain plays a dominant role. To elucidate Mid1s membrane binding mechanism, we used the available structural information of the C terminal region of Mid1 in all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) near a membrane with a lipid composition based on experimental measurements (including PIP2 lipids). The disordered L3 loop of C2, as well as the PH domain, separately bind the membrane through charged lipid contacts. In simulations with the full C terminal region started away from the membrane, Mid1 binds through the L3 loop and is stabilized in a vertical orientation with the PH domain away from the membrane. However, a configuration with both C2 and PH initially bound to the membrane remains associated with the membrane. These multiple modes of binding may reflect Mid1s multiple interactions with membranes and other node proteins, and ability to sustain mechanical forces.",

Cells within condensates undergo fate and morphological changes, and induce cell fate changes in nearby epithelia to produce structures including hair follicles, feathers or intestinal villi. Here, by imaging of mouse and chicken embryonic skin, we find that mesenchymal cells undergo much of their dispersal in early interphase, in a stereotyped process of displacement driven by three hours of rapid and persistent migration, followed by a long period of low motility. The cell division plane and the elevated migration speed and persistence of newly born mesenchymal cells are mechanosensitive, aligning with tension in the tissue.

    "abstract": "The eukaryotic polyphosphate (polyP) polymerase VTC complex synthesizes polyP from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and translocates polyP across the vacuolar membrane to maintain an intracellular phosphate (Pi) homeostasis. To discover how VTC complex solves this fundamental aspect, we determined a cryo-electron microscopy structure of an endogenous VTC complex (Vtc4/Vtc3/Vtc1) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae at 3.1 [A] resolution. The structure reveals a heteropentameric architecture of one Vtc4, one Vtc3 and three Vtc1 subunits. The transmembrane region forms a polyP selective channel, probably adopting a resting state conformation, in which a latch-like, horizonal helix of Vtc4 limits the entrance. The catalytic Vtc4 central domain locates on top of the pseudo-symmetric polyP channel, creating a strongly electropositive pathway for nascent polyP that can couple synthesis to translocation. The SPX domain of Vtc4 positively regulates polyP synthesis and regulation of VTC complex. The non-catalytic Vtc3 regulates VTC through a phoshorylatable loop. Our findings, along with the functional data, allow us to propose a mechanism of polyP channel gating and VTC complex activation.",

    "abstract": "Padavannil et al. 2019 show that Importin-9 (Imp9) transports Histones H2A-H2B from the cytoplasm to the nucleus using a non-canonical mechanism whereby binding of a GTP-bound Ran GTPase (RanGTP) fails to evict the H2A-H2B cargo. Instead, a stable complex forms, comprised of equimolar RanGTP, Imp9, and H2A-H2B. Unlike the binary Imp9*H2A-H2B complex, this RanGTP*Imp9*H2A-H2B ternary complex can release H2A-H2B to an assembling nucleosome. Here, we define the molecular basis for this RanGTP-activated nucleosome assembly by Imp9. We use hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry and compare the dynamics and interfaces of the RanGTP*Imp9*H2A-H2B ternary complex to those in the Imp9*H2A-H2B or Imp9*RanGTP binary complexes. Our data are consistent with the Imp9*H2A-H2B structure by Padavannil et al. 2019 showing that Imp9 HEAT repeats 4-5 and 18-19 contact H2A-H2B, as well as many homologous importin*RanGTP structures showing that importin HEAT repeats 1 and 3, and the h8 loop, contact RanGTP. We show that Imp9 stabilizes H2A-H2B beyond the direct binding site, similar to other histone chaperones. Importantly, we reveal that binding of RanGTP releases H2A-H2B interaction at Imp9 HEAT repeats 4-5, but not 18-19. This exposes DNA- and histone-binding surfaces of H2A-H2B, thereby facilitating nucleosome assembly. We also reveal that RanGTP has a weaker affinity for Imp9 when H2A-H2B is bound. This may ensure that H2A-H2B is only released in high RanGTP concentrations near chromatin. We delineate the molecular link between the nuclear import of H2A-H2B and its deposition into chromatin by Imp9.\n\nSignificanceImp9 is the primary importin for shuttling H2A-H2B from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. It employs an unusual mechanism where the binding of RanGTP alone is insufficient to release H2A-H2B. The resulting stable RanGTP*Imp9*H2A-H2B complex gains nucleosome assembly activity as H2A-H2B can be deposited onto an assembling nucleosome. We show that H2A-H2B is allosterically stabilized via interactions with both N- and C-terminal portions of Imp9, reinforcing its chaperone-like behavior. RanGTP binding causes H2A-H2B release from the N-terminal portion of Imp9 only. The newly-exposed H2A-H2B surfaces can interact with DNA or H3-H4 in nucleosome assembly. Imp9 thus plays a multi-faceted role in histone import, storage, and deposition regulated by RanGTP, controlling histone supply in the nucleus and to chromatin.",

We suspect that such disparate functions are due to variable composition in EV subtypes and ENPs of the analyzed EV preparations.

Unexpectedly, we identified virus-like particles (VLPs) from endogenous murine leukemia virus in preparations of EVs produced by tumor cells.

Although a soluble isoform, sFLT1, is often mis-regulated in disease and aging, how sFLT1 is trafficked and secreted from endothelial cells is not well understood. Here we define requirements for constitutive sFLT1 trafficking and secretion in endothelial cells from the Golgi to the plasma membrane, and we show that sFLT1 secretion requires clathrin at or near the Golgi. Perturbations that affect sFLT1 trafficking blunted endothelial cell secretion and promoted intracellular mis-localization in cells and zebrafish embryos. siRNA-mediated depletion of specific trafficking components revealed requirements for RAB27A, VAMP3, and STX3 for post-Golgi vesicle trafficking and sFLT1 secretion, while STX6, ARF1, and AP1 were required at the Golgi. Depletion of STX6 altered vessel sprouting in a 3D angiogenesis model, indicating that endothelial cell sFLT1 secretion is important for proper vessel sprouting. Thus, specific trafficking components provide a secretory path from the Golgi to the plasma membrane for sFLT1 in endothelial cells that utilizes a specialized clathrin-dependent intermediate, suggesting novel therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of human receptors that transmit signals from natural ligands and pharmaceutical drugs into essentially every physiological process. One main characteristic of GPCRs is their ability to specifically couple with different families of G-proteins, thereby triggering specific downstream signaling pathways. While an abundance of structural information is available on GPCR interactions with G-proteins, little is known about the GPCR domains functionally mediating G-protein specificity, in particular the proximal C-terminus, the structure which cannot be predicted with high confidentiality due to its flexibility. In this study, we exploited OptoGPCR chimeras between light-gated GPCRs (opsins) and ligand-gated GCPRs to systematically investigate the involvement of the C-terminus steering G-protein specificity. We employed rhodopsin-beta2-adrenoceptor and melanopsin-mGluR6 chimeras. We discovered a dominant role of the proximal C-terminus, dictating G-protein selectivity in the melanopsin-mGluR6 chimera, whereas it is the intracellular loop 3, which steers G-protein tropism in the rhodopsin-beta2-adrenoceptor. From the functional results and structural predictions, melanopsin and mGluR6 use a different mechanism to bRhod and b2AR to couple to a selective G-protein. Collectively, this work adds knowledge to the GPCR domains mediating G-protein selectivity, ultimately paving the way to optogenetically elicited specific G-protein signaling on demand.",

    "abstract": "Tracing the differentiation of the hematopoietic progenitor cells(HPCs) in human blood, particularly with the scarcity in adults, has been challenging owing to unable capture the entire differentiation stages and subgroups of HPCs. Deciphering the underlying hematopoiesis mechanism, including progenitor cells definition and fate decisions identification, is critical to understanding fundamental questions of hematopoietic lineage commitment. Often, the use of classic and traditional surface markers has been shown to be inadequate, speciosity, and ineffective in accurately defining hematopoietic progenitors. The lineage definition and commitment of hematopoietic progenitors in adult peripheral blood remains to be elucidated by a reliable transcriptional atlas. Here, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA) was employed to define the lineage of HPCs and reaffirm the hierarchy of hematopoiesis. A total of 27,566 adult peripheral blood CD34+ cells were enriched and sequenced, capturing most differentiation stages and subgroups of HPCs. HPCs lineages were redefined by unique makers and key factor genes. We are the first to clearly depict the transcriptional atlas and define each subgroup of adult peripheral blood progenitors. We recovered the key transcript factors involved in lineage fate decision, and restructured the lineage commitment model of HPCs that can reconcile previous models and explain conflicts among functional studies. Several fate decision key factors of progenitors were identified as major switches that controlled hematopoietic lineage formation. Moreover, we are also the first to identify the cell fate decision transcriptional factors in each branch among hematopoietic hierarchy formation. Our reaffirmed lineage commitment also revealed that the erythroid lineage commitment process is a continuous process but the lymphoid lineage commitment process is more likely a discrete stepwise process that showed distinct lineage-committed populations during the hematopoiesis. With these information, an elaborate and comprehensive transcriptional atlas of all types of hematopoietic progenitors was then constructed, which enabled the whole map of the transcriptional signal and pathway among lineage commitment. Importantly, this newly created atlas can enable accurate definition, transplantation, and biological insights of hematopoietic progenitors for facilitating new research development in cell engineering, regenerative medicine, and disease treatment, which we call Artificial Operation of HPCs. Furthermore, this opens up a wide variety of possibilities for artificial precise control progenitor cell differentiation and targeted treatment of immune disease, providing hope for untreatable diseases.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=98 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/524347v4_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (22K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d12768org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@172529aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8d3bc7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4f8d47_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG The reaffirmed lineage commitment model of HPCs\n\nHighlightsO_LIClassic and traditional surface markers are often inadequate, speciosity, and ineffective in accurately defining hematopoietic progenitor cells.\nC_LIO_LIMultiple hematopoietic lineages progenitor cells of adult peripheral blood were clearly depicted and redefined by unique makers and key transcript factors.\nC_LIO_LIKey fate decision transcript factors and genes in each branch among hematopoietic hierarchy formation were recovered by transcriptional atlas.\nC_LIO_LISeveral key factors, including NFE2, LYL1, MYB, CDK4, ETV6, TESPA1, ZBTB16, and GATA2 of myeloid progenitors and RUNX2, HOXA9, JUN/FOS, TCF4, DDIT4, HOPX, KLF10, HOXA3, and TSC22D1 of lymphoid progenitors, were identified as major regulators that controlled hematopoietic lineage formation.\nC_LIO_LIFate decision transcription factors were identified in progenitor cells of erythrocyte (GATA1, KLF1), monocyte (MAFB, IRF8), B cells (PAX5, PRDM1), NK cells (DDIT4, HOPX), and T cells (TCF7, GATA3).\nC_LIO_LIPlasma progenitor cells were first identified and defined, and the rearrangements of IGHV, IGKV, and IGLV genes were already existed and occurred during the progenitor state of plasma cells.\nC_LIO_LIThe erythroid lineage commitment process is a continuous process but the lymphoid lineage commitment process is more likely a discrete stepwise process that showed distinct lineage-committed populations during the hematopoiesis.\nC_LIO_LIThe lineage commitment model of HPCs was reaffirmed that can reconcile previous models and explain the conflict among functional studies.\nC_LIO_LITranscriptional atlas of HPCs helps to provide a well explanation of the immune reconstitution in adults and on its cytokines secretion and regulation.\nC_LIO_LIApplication of this atlas can enable artificial precise control progenitor cell differentiation, in vitro accurate culture of each lineage cells, and targeted treatment of immune cell disease to be made possible for future development.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Studying the role of molecularly distinct lipid species in cell signaling remains challenging due to a scarcity of methods for performing quantitative lipid biochemistry in living cells. We have recently used lipid uncaging to quantify lipid-protein affinities and rates of lipid transbilayer movement and turnover in the diacylglycerol signaling pathway using population average time series data. So far, this approach does not allow to account for the cell-to-cell variability of cellular signaling responses. We here report a framework that allows to uniquely identify model parameters such diacylglycerol-protein affinities and transbilayer movement rates at the single cell level for a broad variety of structurally different diacylglycerol species. We find that lipid unsaturation degree and longer side chains generally correlate with faster lipid transbilayer movement and turnover and higher lipid-protein affinities. In summary, our work demonstrates how rate parameters and lipid-protein affinities can be quantified from single cell signaling trajectories with sufficient sensitivity to resolve the subtle kinetic differences caused by the chemical diversity of cellular signaling lipid pools.",

    "abstract": "Rhombomeres serve to position neural progenitors in the embryonic hindbrain, thereby ensuring appropriate neural circuit formation, but the molecular identities of individual rhombomeres and the mechanism whereby they form have not been fully established. Here we apply scMultiome analysis in zebrafish to molecularly resolve all rhombomeres for the first time. We find that rhombomeres become molecularly distinct between 10hpf (end of gastrulation) and 13hpf (early segmentation). While the mature hindbrain consists of alternating odd- versus even-type rhombomeres, our scMultiome analyses do not detect extensive odd versus even characteristics in the early hindbrain. Instead, we find that each rhombomere displays a unique gene expression and chromatin profile. Prior to the appearance of distinct rhombomeres, we detect three hindbrain progenitor clusters (PHPDs) that correlate with the earliest visually observed segments in the hindbrain primordium and that represent prospective rhombomere r2/r3 (possibly including r1), r4 and r5/r6, respectively. We further find that the PHPDs form in response to Fgf and RA morphogens and that individual PHPD cells co-express markers of multiple mature rhombomeres. We propose that the PHPDs contain mixed-identity progenitors and that their subdivision into individual mature rhombomeres requires resolution of mixed transcription and chromatin states.",

    "abstract": "Most genetic research animals (e.g., vertebrates, insects, nematodes) segregate germline and soma during early embryogenesis. In contrast, some highly regenerative bilaterian (e.g., planarians) and non-bilaterian animals (e.g., hydrozoan cnidarians) retain adult stem cells with both germinal and somatic potentials. As these cells have been studied in only few phyla, their biology and evolution remain mostly enigmatic. Here, we aimed to identify and characterize adult stem cells and their cell lineages in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis by combining gene expression analysis, immunostainings, and meganuclease-mediated and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in reporter lines of conserved germline and multipotency genes (e.g., vasa2, piwi1). We found a small population of vasa2+/piwi1+ cells in the gastrodermal folds of juvenile and adult sea anemones that generates germline and a diversity of somatic, mostly proliferative cells. Using a combination of soxB(2) neural progenitor and piwi1 reporter lines, we found that the somatic progeny from vasa2+/piwi1+ cells includes soxB(2)+ neural progenitors. Our results strongly support the existence of an adult Vasa2+/Piwi1+ multipotent stem-like cell population that derives both germline and somatic lineages in Nematostella. The similarities of lineages and gene expression profiles between Nematostella Vasa2+/Piwi1+ stem-like cells and hydrozoan interstitial stem cells support their evolutionary conservation among cnidarians.",

    "abstract": "Haploid embryos have contributed significantly to our understanding of the role of parental genomes in development and can be applied to important biotechnology for human and animal species. However, development to the blastocyst stage is severely hindered in bovine haploid androgenetic embryos (hAE). To further our understanding of such developmental arrest, we performed a comprehensive comparison of the transcriptomic profile of morula-stage embryos, which were validated by qRT-PCR of transcripts associated with differentiation in haploid and biparental embryos. Among numerous disturbances, results showed that pluripotency pathways, especially the wingless-related integration site (WNT) signaling, were particularly unbalanced in hAE. Moreover, transcript levels of KLF4, NANOG, POU5F1, SOX2, CDX2, CTNNBL1, AXIN2, and GSK3B were noticeably altered in hAE, suggesting disturbance of pluripotency and canonical WNT pathway. To evaluate the role of WNT on hAE competence, we exposed early day-5 morula stage embryos to the GSK3B inhibitor CHIR99021. Although no alterations were observed in pluripotency and WNT-related transcripts, exposure to CHIR99021 improved their ability to reach the blastocysts stage, confirming the importance of the WNT pathway in the developmental features of bovine hAE.\n\nSummary statementThis study shows the importance of the WNT pathway on bovine haploid androgenetic development by walking through transcriptomics and pluripotency markers associated with cell fate determination during early development.",

    "abstract": "Many ion channels are multi-subunit complexes with a polar permeation pathway at the oligomeric interface, but their mechanisms of assembly into functional, thermodynamically stable units within the membrane are largely unknown. Here we characterize the assembly of the inverted-topology, homodimeric fluoride channel Fluc, leveraging a known mutation, N43S, that weakens Na+ binding to the dimer interface, thereby unlocking the complex. While single-channel recordings show Na+ is required for activation, single-molecule photobleaching and bulk Forster Resonance Energy Transfer experiments in lipid bilayers demonstrate that N43S Fluc monomers and dimers exist in dynamic equilibrium, even without Na+. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate this equilibrium is dominated by a differential in the lipid-solvation energetics of monomer and dimer, which stems from hydrophobic exposure of the polar ion pathway in the monomer. These results suggest a model wherein membrane-associated forces induce channel assembly while subsequent factors, in this case Na+ binding, result in channel activation.\n\nTeaserMembrane morphology energetics foster inverted-topology Fluc channels to form dimers, which then become active upon Na+ binding.",

    "abstract": "To accomplish its role of signaling hub in all Wnt signaling pathways, Dishevelled (DVL) protein needs to dynamically relocalize to the inner leaflet of the cellular plasma membrane (PM). Combined experimental and computational evidence showed that the binding of DVL to the PM is mainly driven by the electrostatic attraction between a stretch of positively charged amino acids located on the C-terminal DEP domain of DVL and anionic phospholipid species, with a striking preference for phosphatidic acid (PA). Here, by means of computational simulations and QCM-D experiments, we demonstrate that four recently identified phosphorylation sites on DEP domain, alter the electrostatic potential of the membrane binding interface, but do not prevent the recruitment to anionic membranes. On the contrary, the phosphorylated residues are involved in hydrogen bond and ion-mediated interactions with the lipid headgroup of PA. Our results suggest that the effect of phosphorylation on protein-membrane association could be counterintuitive and sensitive to changes in the local environment including specific lipids, salts, and pH.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEPhosphorylation regulates the cellular activity and localization of many peripheral proteins by, among others, decreasing the affinity for negatively charged membranes. Here, we report how phosphorylation affects the membrane interaction of DEP domain from Dishevelled protein, the intracellular signaling hub in Wnt pathways. We found that despite the negative charge induced by phosphorylation, DEP domain was steadily adsorbed to the surface of negatively charged PA-rich membranes, due to a dense network of cation-mediated interactions and hydrogen bonds.",

    "abstract": "Proteins that switch between two structural states as a function of environmental stimuli are widespread in nature. These proteins structurally transduce biochemical information in a manner analogous to how transistors control information flow in computing devices. Engineering challenges ranging from biological computing devices to molecular motors require such two-state switches, but designing these is an unsolved problem as it requires sculpting an energy landscape with two low-energy but structurally distinct conformations that can be modulated by external inputs. Here we describe a general design approach for creating \"hinge\" proteins that populate one distinct state in the absence of ligand and a second designed state in the presence of ligand. X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy, and double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy demonstrate that despite the significant structural differences, the two states are designed with atomic level accuracy. The kinetics and thermodynamics of effector binding can be finely tuned by modulating the free energy differences between the two states; when this difference becomes sufficiently small, we obtain bistable proteins that populate both states in the absence of effector, but collapse to a single state upon effector addition. Like the transistor, these switches now enable the design of a wide array of molecular information processing systems.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquitin-binding NBR1 autophagy receptor plays a prominent role in recognizing ubiquitylated protein aggregates for vacuolar degradation by macroautophagy. Here, we show that upon exposing Arabidopsis plants to intense light, NBR1 associates with photodamaged chloroplasts independently of ATG7, a core component of the canonical autophagy machinery. NBR1 coats both the surface and interior of chloroplasts, which is then followed by direct engulfment of the organelles into the central vacuole via a microautophagy-type process. The relocalization of NBR1 into chloroplasts does not require the chloroplast translocon complexes embedded in the envelope but is instead greatly enhanced by removing the self-oligomerization mPB1 domain of NBR1. The delivery of NBR1-decorated chloroplasts into vacuoles depends on the ubiquitin-binding UBA2 domain of NBR1 but is independent of the ubiquitin E3 ligases SP1 and PUB4, known to direct the ubiquitylation of chloroplast surface proteins. Compared to wild-type plants, nbr1 mutants have altered levels of a subset of chloroplast proteins and display abnormal chloroplast density and sizes upon high light exposure. We postulate that, as photodamaged chloroplasts lose envelope integrity, cytosolic ligases reach the chloroplast interior to ubiquitylate thylakoid and stroma proteins which are then recognized by NBR1 for autophagic clearance. This study uncovers a new function of NBR1 in the degradation of damaged chloroplasts by microautophagy.",

    "abstract": "Compulsive alcohol drinking is a key symptom of alcohol use disorder (AUD) that is particularly resistant to treatment. An understanding of the biological factors that underly compulsive drinking will allow for the development of new therapeutic targets for AUD. One animal model of compulsive alcohol drinking involves the addition of bitter-tasting quinine to an ethanol solution and measuring the willingness of the animal to consume ethanol despite the aversive taste. Previous studies have demonstrated that this type of aversion-resistant drinking is modulated in the insular cortex of male mice by specialized condensed extracellular matrix known as perineuronal nets (PNNs), which form a lattice-like structure around parvalbumin-expressing neurons in the cortex. Several laboratories have shown that female mice exhibit higher levels of aversion-resistant ethanol intake but the role of PNNs in females in this behavior has not been examined. Here we compared PNNs in the insula of male and female mice and determined if disrupting PNNs in female mice would alter aversion-resistant ethanol intake. PNNs were visualized in the insula by fluorescent labeling with Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) and disrupted in the insula by microinjecting chondroitinase ABC, an enzyme that digests the chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan component of PNNs. Mice were tested for aversion-resistant ethanol consumption by the addition of sequentially increasing concentrations of quinine to the ethanol in a two-bottle choice drinking in the dark procedure. PNN staining intensity was higher in the insula of female compared to male mice, suggesting that PNNs in females might contribute to elevated aversion-resistant drinking. However, disruption of PNNs had limited effect on aversion-resistant drinking in females. In addition, activation of the insula during aversion-resistant drinking, as measured by c-fos immunohistochemistry, was lower in female mice than in males. Taken together, these results suggest that neural mechanisms underlying aversion-resistant ethanol consumption differ in males and females.",

Such analyses are often challenging due to a lack of good controls and the heterogeneous nature of the samples. Here, we present a deep generative model that can replace control samples. The model is trained on RNA-seq data from healthy tissues and learns a low-dimensional representation that clusters tissues very well without supervision. When applied to cancer samples, the model accurately identifies representations close to the tissue of origin. We interpret these inferred representations as the closest normal to the disease samples and use the resulting count distributions to perform differential expression analysis of single cancer samples without control samples. In a detailed analysis of breast cancer, we demonstrate how our approach finds subtype-specific cancer driver and marker genes with high specificity and greatly outperforms the state-of-the-art method in detecting differentially expressed genes, DESeq2. We further show that the significant genes found using the model are highly enriched within cancer-specific driver genes across different cancer types.

The results showed the existence of six different folding states, including the native state (N) at neutral pH, the molten globule state (MG) at pH 2, the acid-unfolded state (UA) at pH 1.5 or lower, acid-refolded (A) at pH 0.5, the alkaline denatured state (UB) at pH 8-12, and the complete denatured state (D) at a GuHCl concentration beyond 5 M. Absorbance studies indicated the presence of free heme in the pH range of 1-2. The protein showed stability and structural integrity across a wide pH range (3-10), temperature (70 {degrees}C), and high concentrations of GuHCl (5 M) and urea (8 M). This study is the first to report multiple  partially folded intermediate states of A. lakoocha peroxidase, with varying amounts of secondary structure, stability, and compactness. These results demonstrate the high stability of A. lakoocha peroxidase and its potential for biotechnological and industrial applications, making it a valuable model system for further studies on its structure-function relationship.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic lethality (SL) is a promising concept in cancer research. A wide array of computational tools has been developed to predict and exploit synthetic lethality for the identification of tumour-specific vulnerabilities. Previously, we introduced the concept of genetic Minimal Cut Sets (gMCSs), a theoretical approach to SL for genome-scale metabolic networks. The major challenge in our gMCS framework is to go beyond metabolic networks and extend existing algorithms to more complex protein-protein interactions. We present here a novel computation approach that adapts our previous gMCS formulation to incorporate linear regulatory pathways. Our novel approach is applied to calculate gMCSs in integrated metabolic and regulatory models of human cells. In particular, we integrate the most recent genome-scale metabolic network, Human1, with 3 different regulatory network databases: Omnipath, Dorothea and TRRUST. Based on the computed gMCSs and transcriptomic data, we detail new essential genes and their associated synthetic lethals for different cancer cell lines. The performance of the different integrated models is assessed with available large-scale in-vitro gene silencing data. Finally, we discuss the most relevant gene essentiality predictions based on published literature in cancer research.",

    "abstract": "The extent to which plants thermoregulate to maintain relatively stable metabolic function in response to gradual and rapid temperature changes that jeopardize crop production is unclear. Maize thermoregulation was investigated based on leaf temperature (TL) measurements and its relationship with photochemistry and stomatal conductance (gs) under dry and wet soil scenarios. Seasonal climatology was simulated in a growth chamber according to Beijings climatology with extreme \"hot days\" based on historical maxima.\n\nMaize behaved as a limited homeotherm, an adaptive strategy to maintain photosynthesis around optimum temperatures (Topt). Plants on drier soil had lower thermoregulatory capacity, with reduced gs, photosynthesis and transpiration, which impacted final yields, despite acclimation with a higher Topt to sustained stress. On hot days thermoregulation was affected by heat stress and water availability, suggesting that strong and frequent heatwaves will reduce crop activity although increased temperatures could bring photosynthesis closer to Topt in the region.\n\nWe propose a novel mechanism to explain thermoregulation from the contribution of heat dissipation via non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) to TL, supporting our hypothesis that NPQ acts as a negative feedback mechanism from photosynthesis by increasing TL in suboptimal conditions. These results could help to design adaptation strategies based on deficit irrigation.\n\nHighlightMaize was able to maintain leaf temperatures in narrower ranges than air temperatures by dissipating sunlight not used in photosynthesis as heat energy with a key role of transpiration cooling to sustain optimum photosynthesis temperature.",

    "abstract": "Degradation of carotenoids in food crops during post-harvest storage results in major economic and nutritional losses. In this study, a pepper (Capsicum annuum) panel for post-harvest carotenoid retention was studied to elucidate underlying mechanisms associated with this commercial trait of interest. Quantitative determination of carotenoid pigments and concurrent cellular analysis indicated that those pepper fruit with thicker lipid exocarp layers and smooth surfaces, following post-harvest drying and storage, possessed increased carotenoid retention. Total cutin monomer content increased in high carotenoid retention fruits and sub-epidermal cutin deposits were responsible for the difference in exocarp thickness. Cutin biosynthesis and cuticle precursor transport genes were differentially expressed between high and low carotenoid retention genotypes, and this supports the finding that fruit cuticle biosynthesis is associated with carotenoid retention. Carotenoids were located within cells embedded within the sub-epidermal cutin layer, and these carotenoids were protected from degradation due to the lack of permeability of the fruit surface to reactive oxygen species, and their precursors. The identification of a novel role for the pepper fruit surface in protecting against carotenoid degradation serves as an important discovery for the function of the fruit cuticle and provides an exploitable resource to enhance fruit quality.\n\nHighlight statementCarotenoid pigments in Chilli pepper confer post-harvest colour and nutritional quality.

To elucidate these, we stimulated MCF-7 breast cancer cells with either FGF2, FGF3, FGF4, FGF10, or FGF19. Following activation of the receptor, we quantified the kinase activity dynamics of 44 kinases using a targeted mass spectrometry assay. Our system-wide kinase activity data, supplemented with (phospho)proteomics data, reveal ligand-dependent distinct pathway dynamics, elucidate the involvement of not earlier reported kinases such as MARK, and revise some of the pathway effects on biological outcomes.

    "abstract": "Across phyla, species-specific vocalizations are used by males to attract females. Functional analyses of the neural circuitry underlying behavior have been difficult, particularly in vertebrates. However, using an ex vivo brain preparation that produces fictive vocalizations, we previously identified anatomically distinct fast and slow central pattern generators (CPGs) that drive the fast and slow clicks of male courtship calls in male African clawed frogs, Xenopus laevis. To gain insight into the evolution of neural circuits underlying courtship calls, we extended this approach to four additional species. Here, we show that although the exact rate and duration of the clicks are unique to each species, fast and slow CPGs identified in male X. laevis are conserved across species. Further, we show that the development of fast CPGs depends on testosterone in a species-specific manner: testosterone facilitates the development of fast CPGs in a species with a courtship call containing fast clicks, but not in a species with a courtship call made entirely of slow clicks. Finally, we showed that, unlike other vestigial neural circuits that remain latent, the fast CPGs are not inherited by all species; rather, they are possessed only by the species that produce fast clicks. The results suggest that species-specific calls of the genus Xenopus have evolved by utilizing conserved fast or slow CPGs that are broadly tuned to generate fast or slow trains of clicks, the development of which appear to be regulated by a strategic expression of testosterone receptors in the brain of each species.",

    "abstract": "Perception engages the processes of integration, recalibration and sometimes motor adaptation to deal with discrepant multisensory stimuli. These processes supposedly deal with sensory discrepancies on different time scales, with integration reducing immediate ones and recalibration and motor adaptation reflecting the cumulative influence of their recent history. Importantly, whether discrepant signals are bound during perception is guided by the brains inference of whether they originate from a common cause. When combined, these two notions lead to the hypothesis that the different time scales on which integration and recalibration (or motor adaptation) operate are associated with different time scales of evidence of a common cause underlying two signals. We tested this prediction in a well-established visuo-motor paradigm, in which human participants performed visually guided hand movements. The kinematic correlation between hand and cursor movements indicates their common origin, allowing us to manipulate the common-cause evidence by this correlation between visual and proprioceptive signals. Specifically, we dissociated hand and cursor signals during individual movements while preserving their correlation across movement endpoints. Following our hypothesis, this manipulation reduced integration compared to a condition in which visual and proprioceptive signals were perfectly correlated. In contrast, recalibration and motor adaption were not affected. This supports the notion that multisensory integration and recalibration are guided by common-cause evidence but deal with sensory discrepancies on different time scales: while integration is prompted by local common-cause evidence and reduces immediate discrepancies instantaneously, recalibration and motor adaptation are prompted by global common-cause evidence and reduce persistent discrepancies.",

We expected the cortical representations of synergistic muscle pairs to overlap more than those of non-synergistic muscles. To detail this, we used navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation in eight hand and forearm muscles of twenty healthy participants. We transformed the cortical representations of muscles to a template MRI to allow for group analysis. We found that the amount of overlap in cortical representations differed significantly between within-hand and within-forearm muscle combinations. Most synergistic muscle pairs, both within the hand, within the forearm and between them, had a larger overlap than non-synergistic muscle pairs. Our study supports the largely overlapping nature of cortical representations of upper limb muscles. We can particularly underscore that the overlap is elevated in muscles that usually act in a synergistic manner.",

    "abstract": "Memory consolidation relies on the reactivation of previous experiences during sleep. The precise interplay of sleep-related oscillations (slow oscillations, spindles and ripples) is thought to coordinate the information flow between relevant brain areas, with ripples mediating memory reactivation. However, in humans empirical evidence for a role of ripples in memory reactivation is lacking. Here, we investigated the relevance of sleep oscillations and specifically ripples for memory reactivation during human sleep using targeted memory reactivation (TMR). Intracranial electrophysiology in epilepsy patients and scalp EEG in healthy participants revealed that elevated levels of SO-spindle activity promoted the read-out of TMR induced memory reactivation. Importantly, spindle-locked ripples recorded intracranially from the medial temporal lobe were found to be instrumental for memory reactivation to unfold during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Our findings establish ripples as key-oscillation in human systems consolidation and emphasize the importance of the coordinated interplay of the cardinal sleep oscillations.",

    "abstract": "Crohns Disease (CD) is a presentation of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) that manifests in childhood and adolescence, and involves chronic and severe enterocolitis, immune and gut microbiome dysregulation, and other complications. Diet and gut-microbiota-produced metabolites are sources of anti-inflammatories which could ameliorate symptoms. However, questions remain on how IBD influences biogeographic patterns of microbial location and function in the gut, how early life transitional gut communities are affected by IBD and diet interventions, and how disruption to biogeography alters disease mediation by diet components or microbial metabolites. Many studies on diet and IBD use a chemically induced ulcerative colitis model, despite the availability of an immune-modulated CD model. Interleukin-10-knockout (IL-10-KO) mice on a C57BL/6 background, beginning at age 4 or 7 weeks, were fed a control diet or one containing 10% (w/w) raw broccoli sprouts, which was high in the sprout-sourced anti-inflammatory sulforaphane. Diets began 7 days prior to, and for 2 weeks after inoculation with Helicobacter hepaticus, which triggers Crohns-like symptoms in these immune-impaired mice. The broccoli sprout diet increased sulforaphane in plasma; decreased weight stagnation, fecal blood, and diarrhea associated; and increased microbiota richness in the gut, especially in younger mice. Sprout diets resulted in some anatomically specific bacteria in younger mice, and reduced the prevalence and abundance of pathobiont bacteria which trigger inflammation in the IL-10-KO mouse, for example; Escherichia coli and Helicobacter. Overall, the IL-10-KO mouse model is responsive to a raw broccoli sprout diet and represents an opportunity for more diet-host-microbiome research.\n\nImportanceTo our knowledge, IL-10-KO mice have not previously been used to investigate the interactions of host, microbiota, and broccoli, broccoli sprouts, or broccoli bioactives in resolving symptoms of CD. We showed that a diet containing 10% raw broccoli sprouts increased the plasma concentration of the anti-inflammatory compound sulforaphane, and protected mice to varying degrees against negative disease symptoms, including weight loss or stagnation, fecal blood, and diarrhea. Younger mice responded more strongly to the diet, further reducing symptoms, as well as increased gut bacterial community richness, increased bacterial community similarity to each other, and more location-specific communities than older mice on the diet intervention. Crohns Disease disrupts the lives of patients, and requires people to alter dietary and lifestyle habits to manage symptoms. The current medical treatment is extremely expensive, and a dietary intervention represents an affordable, accessible, and simple strategy to reduce the burden of symptoms.",

The workflows have been integrated into the free MoveApps platform and are available there. The analysis code of all components of the workflows is openly available on GitHub, and improvement and adaption to other, similar requirements is encouraged.\n\nWith three example data sets of white storks (WS), red kites (RK) and marsh harriers (MH), we illustrate how the workflows are used. The first workflow identifies nesting sites and time of nesting from the GPS tracks, the second workflow calculates flight speeds, flight duration, flight height and distance from the nest. Estimated flight speeds show low within species variability, with averages of 4.1 m/s (MH), 6.9 m/s (RK) and 10.9 m/s (WS). Extracted times of nesting are widely spread through the season and flight height and distance to the nest when in flight show large differences between individuals and years. Similar to the central evaluation distances around the nest required by national legislation, the 50% in-flight usage thresholds are 700 m (MH), 1100 m (RK) and 1400 m (WS). Flight height during nesting is rather low, on average 16 m (MH), 75 m (RK) and 193 m (WS) above the ground.\n\nThese values can help to estimate collision risk with wind turbines for large birds in Central Europe during their nesting period. Finally, the developed MoveApps workflows (an possible adaptions) can be used to extract required parameters from tracking studies of any other vulnerable species or populations in an unbiased, automated manner to improve wind turbine placement in relation to nesting sites.",

    "abstract": "O_LIGiven the current and anticipated rates of global change, with associated shifts in herbivore population densities, understanding the role of different herbivores in shaping ecosystem structure and processes is critical for predicting ecosystem responses. Here, we examined the controls exerted by migratory geese and resident, non-migratory ungulates, two dominating yet functionally contrasting herbivores, on the rapidly warming Arctic tundra.\nC_LIO_LIWe collected vegetation and ecosystem carbon flux data at peak plant growing season in the two longest running herbivore removal experiments in high-Arctic Svalbard. Herbivore exclosures had been set up independently in a wet habitat utilised by barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) in summer and in mesic-to-dry habitats utilised by wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus) year-round.\nC_LIO_LIExcluding geese produced vegetation state transitions from heavily grazed, moss-dominated (4 g m-2 dry weight of live aboveground vascular plants) to ungrazed, graminoid-dominated (60 g m-2; after 4-yr exclusion) and then horsetail-dominated (150 g m-2; after 15-yr exclusion) tundra. This caused large increases in vegetation carbon and nitrogen pools, dead biomass and moss-layer depth. Modifications in nitrogen concentrations and carbon-to-nitrogen ratios of vegetation and soil suggested overall slower nutrient cycling rates in the short-term absence of geese. Long-term goose removal quadrupled the net ecosystem carbon sequestration by increasing gross ecosystem photosynthesis more than ecosystem respiration.\nC_LIO_LIExcluding reindeer for 21 years also produced detectable, but weaker, increases in live and dead biomass, vegetation carbon and nitrogen pools, moss-layer depth and ecosystem respiration. Yet, reindeer removal did not alter the chemistry of either vegetation or soil, nor net ecosystem carbon sequestration.\nC_LIO_LIOur findings suggest that, though both herbivores were key drivers of ecosystem structure and processes, localised effects of geese, highly concentrated in space and time, are larger than those exerted by more widely dispersed reindeer. We illustrate that the impacts of herbivory across the tundra landscape are contingent on the habitat utilised for foraging, its sensitivity, the exerted grazing pressure, and herbivore characteristics. Our results underscore the conspicuous heterogeneity in how Arctic herbivores control ecosystem functioning, with important implications under current and future global change.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Euphorbia canariensis is an iconic endemic species of the Canary Islands and one of the most characteristic species of lowland xerophytic communities known, in Spanish, as  cardonal-tabaibal. This species is widely distributed in the archipelago, which contrasts with the theoretically low dispersal abilities suggested by its unspecialized diasporas. Furthermore, the phylogenetic relationships of this species are unclear, although it is thought to be related to the Indian E. epiphylloides and not to other cactus-like Euphorbia of the Canary Islands (E. handiensis) and Africa. Here we aimed to reconstruct the evolutionary history of E. canariensis at two levels: (i) a phylogenetic approach aimed at unravelling relationships of this species and large-scale biogeographic patterns, and (ii) a phylogeographic approach focused on the history of colonization between islands of the Canarian archipelago in relation to habitat availability for this species through time. Based on previous phylogenetic studies of Euphorbia, we sequenced the ITS region for E. canariensis and several potentially related species to build a phylogenetic framework. We also sequenced two cpDNA regions for 92 individuals from 29 populations of E. canariensis representing its distribution range. We estimated the number of inter-island colonization events using PAICE, a recently developed method that includes a sampling effort correction. Additionally, we used species distribution modelling (SDM) to project current habitat availability for E. canariensis to past periods. Phylogenetic results supported the Canarian E. canariensis as closely related to the Southeast Asian E. epiphylloides and E. sessiliflora. In the Canarian archipelago, E. canariensis displayed a surprising west-to-east colonization pattern. The estimated number of inter-island colonization events was c. 20 - 50, and SDM suggested an increase in habitat availability in recent times. In summary, in this study we confirmed an extreme biogeographic disjunction between Macaronesia and Southeast Asia, described only for a small number of plant species, and estimated relatively low dispersal capabilities for E. canariensis, with a west-to-east colonization pattern in the Canary Islands.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThe Canarian Euphorbia canariensis is sister to Southeast Asian species.\nC_LIO_LIThis lineage shows one of the widest disjunctions affecting Macaronesian plants.\nC_LIO_LIThe lack of intermediate relatives could be the result of extinction events.\nC_LIO_LIE. canariensis displays low colonization ability in the Canarian archipelago.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis is currently the leading cause of death by any bacterial infection1. The mycolic acid layer of the cell wall is essential for viability and virulence, and the enzymes responsible for its synthesis are therefore front line targets for antimycobacterial drug development2,3. Polyketide synthase 13 (Pks13) is a module comprised of a closely symmetric parallel dimer of chains, each encoding several enzymatic and transport functions, that carries out the condensation of two different very long chain fatty acids to produce mycolic acids that are essential components of the mycobacterial cell wall. Consequently individual enzymatic domains of Pks13 are targets for antimycobacterial drug development4. To understand this machinery, we sought to determine the structure and domain trajectories of the dimeric multi-enzyme Pks13, a 2x198,426 Dalton complex, from protein purified endogenously from mycobacteria under normal growth conditions, to capture it with normal substrates bound trapped  in action.\n\nStructures of the multi-domain assembly revealed by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) define the ketosynthase (KS), linker, and acyltransferase (AT) domains, each at atomic resolution (1.8[A]), with bound substrates defined at 2.4[A] and 2.9[A] resolution. Image classification reveals two distinct structures with alternate locations of the N-terminal acyl carrier protein (termed ACP1a, ACP1b) seen at 3.6[A] and 4.6[A] resolution respectively. These two structures suggest plausible intermediate states, related by a ~60[A] movement of ACP1, on the pathway for substrate delivery from the fatty acyl-ACP ligase (FadD32) to the ketosynthase domain. The linking sequence between ACP1 and the KS includes an 11 amino acid sequence with 6 negatively charged side chains that lies in different positively charged grooves on the KS in ACP1a versus ACP1b structures. This charge complementarity between the extended chain and the grooves suggests some stabilization of these two distinct orientations. Other domains are visible at lower resolution and indicate flexibility relative to the KS-AT core. The chemical structures of three bound endogenous long chain fatty acid substrates with their proximal regions defined in the structures were determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.\n\nThe domain proximities were probed by chemical cross-linking and identified by mass spectrometry. These were incorporated into integrative structure modeling to define multiple domain configurations that transport the very long fatty acid chains throughout the multistep Pks13 mediated synthetic pathway.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear receptors (NRs) are transcription factors that regulate essential biological processes in response to cognate ligands. An important part of NR function involves ligand-induced conformational changes that recruit coregulator proteins to the activation function surface (AFS), ~15 [A] away from the ligand binding pocket. Ligands must communicate with the AFS to recruit appropriate coregulators and elicit different transcriptional outcomes, but this communication is poorly understood. These studies illuminate allosteric communication networks underlying activation of liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1), a NR that regulates development, metabolism, cancer progression and intestinal inflammation. Using >100 microseconds of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations involving 69 LRH-1 complexes, we identify distinct signaling circuits used by active and inactive ligands for AFS communication. Inactive ligands communicate via strong, coordinated motions along paths through the receptor to the AFS. Activating ligands disrupt the \"inactive\" circuit by inducing connectivity elsewhere. Ligand-contacting residues in helix 7 help mediate the switch between circuits, suggesting new avenues for developing LRH-1-targeted therapeutics. We also elucidate aspects of coregulator signaling, showing that localized, destabilizing fluctuations are induced by inappropriate ligand-coregulator pairings. These studies have uncovered novel features of LRH-1 allostery, and the quantitative approach used to analyze many simulations provides a framework to study allosteric signaling in other receptors.",

Current multi-omics analysis algorithms failed to systematically dissect the heterogeneity within the datasets when inferring cis-regulatory events. Thus, there is a need for cis-regulatory element inferring algorithms that considers the cellular heterogeneity.\n\nResultsHere, we propose scGREAT, a single-cell multi-omics regulatory state analysis Python package with a rapid graph-based correlation measurement L. The graph-based correlation method assigns each cell a local L index, pinpointing specific cell groups of certain regulatory states. Such single-cell resolved regulatory state information enables the heterogeneity analysis equipped in the package. Applying scGREAT to the 10X Multiome PBMC dataset, we demonstrated how it could help subcluster cell types, infer regulation-based pseudo-time trajectory, discover feature modules, and find cluster-specific regulatory gene-peak pairs. Besides, we showed that global L index, which is the average of all local L values, is a better replacement for Pearsons r in ruling out confounding regulatory relationships that are not of research interests.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/ChaozhongLiu/scGREAT",

    "abstract": "Drug-target interaction prediction is a crucial step in drug development, discovery, and repurposing. Due to the tremendous combinatorial search space of all drug-protein pairs, machine learning algorithms have been utilized to facilitate the identification of novel drug-target interactions. Deep learning, known as a powerful learning system, has recently shown superior performance to traditional machine learning in many biological and biomedical areas. In this paper, we proposed an end-to-end deep learning model, DeepERA, to identify drug-target interactions based on heterogeneous data. This model assembles three independent feature embedding modules (intrinsic embedding, relational embedding, and annotation embedding) which each represent different attributes of the dataset and jointly contribute to the comprehensive predictions. This is the first work that, to our knowledge, applied deep learning models to learn each intrinsic features, relational features, and annotation features and combine them to predict drug-protein interactions. Our results showed that DeepERA outperformed other deep learning approaches proposed recently. The studies of individual embedding modules explained the dominance of DeepERA and confirmed the effects of the \"guilt by associations\" assumption on the performance of the prediction model. Using our DeepERA framework, we identified 45,603 novel drug-protein interactions for the whole human proteome, including 356 drug-protein interactions for the human proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. We also performed computational docking for the selected interactions and conducted a two-way statistical test to \"normalize\" the docking scores of different proteins/drugs to support our predictions.",

We propose LIMBARE, an advanced linear mixed-effects breakpoint analysis with robust estimation, especially designed for longitudinal ophthalmic studies. LIMBARE accommodates repeated measurements from both eyes and overtime, and effectively address the presence of outliers.\n\nMethodsThe model setup of LIMBARE and computing algorithm for point and confidence interval estimates of the breakpoint was introduced. The performance of LIMBARE and other competing methods was assessed via comprehensive simulation studies and application to a longitudinal ophthalmic study with 216 eyes (145 subjects) followed for an average of 3.7{+/-}1.3 years to examine the longitudinal association between structural and functional measurements.\n\nResultsIn simulation studies, LIMBARE showed the smallest bias and mean squared error (MSE) for estimating the breakpoint, with empirical coverage probability of corresponding CI estimate closest to the nominal level for scenarios with and without outlier data points. In the application to the longitudinal ophthalmic study, LIMBARE detected two breakpoints between visual field mean deviation (MD) and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFL) and one breakpoint between MD and cup to disc ratio (CDR), while the cross-sectional analysis approach only detected one and none, respectively.\n\nConclusionsLIMBARE enhances breakpoint estimation accuracy in longitudinal ophthalmic studies, while cross-sectional analysis approach is not recommended for future studies.\n\nTranslational RelevanceOur proposed method and companion software R package provides a valuable computational tool for advancing longitudinal ophthalmology research and exploring the association relationships between ophthalmic variables.",

    "abstract": "Guanine quadruplexes (GQs) are non-canonical nucleic acid structures involved in many biological processes. GQs formed in single-stranded regions often need to be unwound by cellular machinery, so their mechanochemical properties are important. Here, we performed steered molecular dynamics simulations of human telomeric GQs to study their unfolding. We examined four pulling regimes, including very slow setup with pulling velocity and force load accessible to high-speed atomic force microscopy. We identified multiple factors affecting the unfolding mechanism. The more the direction of force was perpendicular to the GQ channel axis (determined by GQ topology), the more the base unzipping mechanism happened. If the GQ had either all-anti or all-syn pattern in a strand, strand slippage mechanism was more likely to occur. Importantly, slower pulling velocity led to richer unfolding pathways including partial refolding attempts. We show that GQ may eventually unfold after force drop under forces smaller than those the GQ withstood before the drop. This suggests that proteins in vivo might resolve GQs even if their stall forces are smaller than GQ rupture force. Finally, we found out that different unfolding intermediates may have very similar chain end-to-end distance, which reveals some limitations of structural interpretations of single-molecule spectroscopic data.",

We demonstrate the performance and accuracy of the software for different types of systems: a relatively structured peptide (polyproline 11), an intrinsically disordered protein (ACTR), and three folded proteins (HiSiaP, SBD2, and MalE).

Here, we present modern classification and machine learning approaches to characterize and harness the genebank of an agrobiodiversity hotspot on Persea americana Mill., an iconic American fruit tree crop that has seen an unprecedented expansion worldwide. We selected 144 accessions from the Colombian National genebank and 240 materials from local plantations in the Colombian Northwest Andes. We genotyped them using a strategy based on reduced representation sequencing. We included available sequences of genotypes from known avocado races, Mexican, Guatemalan, and West Indian, to discover SNPs, analyze the population structure and identify possible new genetic groups in Colombian germplasm. We detected a population structure suggestive of a new fourth race in Colombia, with a possible genetic substructure related to geographical origin (Andean and Caribbean). Hybrid determination and ABC modeling suggested rampant inter-race geneflow. They supported the hypothesis of the high mobility of native avocado trees from Central America to Northern South America starting in the Pleistocene. Our study supports that Colombia might be a new diversity center for P. americana.

    "abstract": "Recent evidence shows that long-term object value association can lead to efficient visual search. However, the neural mechanism of this value pop-out has yet to be understood. Given the known role of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) in visual search and value memory, we recorded its single-unit activity (n=526) in two macaque monkeys while they engaged in the value-driven search. Monkeys had to determine whether a high-value target was present within a variable number of low-value objects. Interestingly, differential neural firing, as well as gamma-band power, indicated the presence of a target within [~]150ms of display onset. This differential activity was negatively correlated with search time and became less display size-dependent for more efficient searches. On the other hand, neural firing and its variability were higher in inefficient searches. These findings reveal the neural code within vlPFC for rapid detection of valuable targets, which can be crucial for animals faced with competition.\n\nSignificance StatementSearch for rewarding objects is ubiquitous and crucial for animals and humans alike. Up until recently, it was thought that visual search for valuable targets that were otherwise not distinct by low-level features should be serial and slow. Contrary to this belief, we showed that given sufficient reward training, valuable objects can be found efficiently in search suggesting a value pop-out neural mechanism. Importantly, we reveal the neural activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to be predictive of the degree of value-driven search efficiency. Given the role of PFC in object value memory, these results show how PFC can translate such memories to emulate the parallel processing of visual information independent of low-level visual features.",

    "abstract": "Loss of neurons in the neural retina is a leading cause of vision loss. While humans do not possess the capacity for retinal regeneration, zebrafish can achieve this through activation of resident Muller glia. Remarkably, despite the presence of Muller glia in humans and other mammalian vertebrates, these cells lack an intrinsic ability to contribute to regeneration. Upon activation, zebrafish Muller glia can adopt a stem cell-like state, undergo proliferation and generate new neurons. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of this activation subsequent retinal regeneration remains unclear. To address this, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and report remarkable heterogeneity in gene expression within quiescent Muller glia across distinct dorsal, central and ventral retina pools of such cells. Next, we utilised a genetically driven, chemically inducible nitroreductase approach to study Muller glia activation following selective ablation of three distinct photoreceptor subtypes: long wavelength sensitive cones, short wavelength sensitive cones, and rods. There, our data revealed that a region-specific bias in activation of Muller glia exists in the zebrafish retina, and this is independent of the distribution of the ablated cell type across retinal regions. Notably, gene ontology analysis revealed that injury-responsive dorsal and central Muller glia express genes related to dorsal/ventral pattern formation, growth factor activity, and regulation of developmental process. Through scRNA-seq analysis, we identify a shared genetic program underlying initial Muller glia activation and cell cycle entry, followed by differences that drive the fate of regenerating neurons. We observed an initial expression of AP-1 and injury-responsive transcription factors, followed by genes involved in Notch signalling, ribosome biogenesis and gliogenesis, and finally expression of cell cycle, chromatin remodeling and microtubule-associated genes. Taken together, our findings document the regional specificity of gene expression within quiescent Muller glia and demonstrate unique Muller glia activation and regeneration features following neural ablation. These findings will improve our understanding of the molecular pathways relevant to neural regeneration in the retina.",

    "abstract": "Exploration is vital for animals and artificial agents who face uncertainty about their environments due to initial ignorance or subsequent changes. Their choices need to balance exploitation of the knowledge already acquired, with exploration to resolve uncertainty [1, 2]. However, the exact algorithmic structure of exploratory choices in the brain still remains largely elusive. A venerable idea in reinforcement learning is that agents can plan appropriate exploratory choices offline, during the equivalent of quiet wakefulness or sleep. Although offline processing in humans and other animals, in the form of hippocampal replay and preplay, has recently been the subject of highly successful modelling [3-5], existing methods only apply to known environments. Thus, they cannot predict exploratory replay choices during learning and/or behaviour in dynamic environments. Here, we extend the theory of Mattar & Daw [3] to examine the potential role of replay in approximately optimal exploration, deriving testable predictions for the patterns of exploratory replay choices in a paradigmatic spatial navigation task. Our modelling provides a normative interpretation of the available experimental data suggestive of exploratory replay. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of sequence replay, and license a range of new experimental paradigms that should further our understanding of offline processing.",

    "abstract": "The problem of pitch perception has been the subject of a long debate between place theory and time theory. Here, we propose a Power Series Template (PoST) model to answer the problem of how and why pitch perception comes about. The sensitive measurement of acoustic signals requires efficient Sound Amplification, which inevitably accompanies mode coupling due to the perturbative non-linearities. Under reinforcement learning for Sound Localization with the second- and third-order modes as default teacher signals, a chain of coincidence is generated. After learning in Sound Localization is completed, two power series templates of 2n and 3m are generated, and the 2f1 - f2 coupling of the elements contained therein fills the blanks of matchable harmonics up to N=10 in the template, providing the well-known harmonic template. When complex tones containing multiple harmonics are input into the trained network, two power series are evoked from each harmonic, and from their intersection, the brain acquires the fundamental of the complex tone as the pitch. Based on this template model, consistent explanations are given for the problems of missing fundamental, pitch shift, pitch and chroma, and resolvability jump without the help of time theory.",

    "abstract": "The human foot sole is the primary interface with the external world during balance and walking, and also provides important tactile information on the state of contact. However, prior studies on plantar pressure have focused mostly on summary metrics such as overall force or centre of pressure under limited conditions. Here, we recorded spatiotemporal plantar pressure patterns with high spatial resolution while participants completed a wide range of daily activities, including balancing, locomotion, and jumping tasks. Contact area differed across task categories, but was only moderately correlated with the overall force experienced by the foot sole. The centre of pressure was often located outside the contact area or in locations experiencing relatively low pressure, and therefore a result of disparate contact regions spread widely across the foot. Non-negative matrix factorisation revealed low-dimensional spatial complexity that increased during interaction with unstable surfaces. Additionally, pressure patterns at the heel and metatarsals decomposed into separately located and robustly identifiable components, jointly capturing most variance in the signal. These results suggest optimal sensor placements to capture task-relevant spatial information and provide insight into how pressure varies spatially on the foot sole during a wide variety of natural behaviours.",

    "abstract": "LEDGF/p75 (LEDGF) main cellular cofactor of HIV-1 integrase (IN), acts as tethering factor to target integration of HIV in actively transcribed genes. Recently a class of IN inhibitors based on inhibition of LEDGF-IN interaction has been developed. We describe here a new series of IN-LEDGF allosteric inhibitors (INLAIs), with potent anti-HIV-1 activity in the one-digit nanomolar range. These compounds inhibited IN-LEDGF interaction while enhancing IN-IN aberrant multimerization by allosteric mechanism. Compounds of this series were fully active on HIV-1 mutants resistant to IN strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) and other class of anti-HIV drugs, confirming that they belong to a new class of antiretrovirals. These compounds displayed most potent antiretroviral activity at post-integration due to aberrant IN polymerization responsible of infectivity defect of viral particles produced. INLAI-resistant mutants were selected by dose escalation method and the most detrimental mutation found was T174I. The impact of these resistance mutations was analyzed by fold shift EC50 with regard to wild type virus and the replication capacity of mutated viruses were determined. Crystal structure of BDM-2, the lead compound of this series in complex with IN catalytic core domain (CCD) was elucidated. No antagonism was observed between BDM-2 and a panel of 16 antiretroviral drugs from different classes. In conclusion, the overall virologic profile of BDM-2 warrants the recently completed single ascending dose phase I trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Id: NCT03634085) and supports further clinical investigation for potential use in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.\n\nAuthor summaryIntegrase-LEDGF allosteric inhibitors are a new class of antiretrovirals recently developed that target the interaction of HIV-1 Integrase with its cellular cofactor LEDGF/p75 required for HIV-1 integration in actively transcribed genes. The great interest of developing such new class of antiretroviral is to add to the anti-HIV drug arsenal compounds that are fully active on resistant viruses to all other classes of drugs currently used in clinic. However, none of these inhibitors are currently in clinical use or in late clinical trials. Here we describe a series of highly potent Integrase allosteric inhibitors that can be considered as precursors of a new class of antiretroviral drugs, with fully conserved activity on viruses resistant to currently used anti-HIV drugs, and a lead compound that has no antagonism with a large panel of present anti-HIV drugs and that was successfully validated in a phase I clinical trial.",

    "abstract": "Cell migrations are crucial for embryonic development, wound healing, the immune response, as well as for cancer progression. In most cells, the RAC1/Arp2/3/WAVE signalling pathway induces branched actin polymerisation, which protrudes the membrane and allows migration. Fine-tuning the activity of the RAC1/Arp2/3/WAVE complex modulates protrusion lifetime and migration persistence. Recently, NHSL1, a novel interactor in this complex has been identified as a negative regulator of cell migration in vitro. We here analysed its function in vivo, during zebrafish gastrulation, as nhsl1b is specifically expressed in migrating mesodermal cells. Loss and gain of function experiments revealed that nhsl1b is required for the proper migration of the mesoderm, controlling cell speed and migration persistence. Consistent with a role in regulating actin dynamics, Nhsl1b localises to the tip of actin-rich protrusions. However, in contrast to the in vitro situation, it appears to be a positive regulator of migration, with its loss of function reducing the length and lifetime of protrusions, whereas overexpression has the opposite effect. These results reveal that the effects of actin modulators depend on the cellular context, and highlight the importance of analysing their function in physiological contexts.",

    "abstract": "Pairwise interactions in food webs, including those between predator and prey are often modulated by a third species. Such higher-order interactions are important structural components of natural food webs that can increase the stability of communities against perturbations and ensure continued ecosystem functioning. Particularly the flux of rare organic and inorganic compounds that are essential to species in the community can create higher-order interactions. Even though many such compounds exist, their effect on structuring communities is little understood. In this study, I perform invasion analyses on a general food web model that depicts apparent and exploitative competition. Introducing the provision of essential resources by a prey species to either its competitor or its predator as a higher-order interaction, I find that this mechanism can ensure the focal preys persistence. Larger dietary essentiality, i.e. a stronger dependence of the predator or the competitor on the essential resource can increase the invasion growth rate of the focal prey to positive values, thus promoting its persistence when it would go extinct for low essentiality. This research shows that essential resources and the higher-order interactions created by them should be considered in community ecology.",

However, LGT in eukaryotes holds many unknowns, especially its frequency, its long-term impact, and the importance of eukaryote-to-eukaryote LGT. LGT, and genome evolution in general, has not been rigorously studied in Rhizaria, which is a large and diverse eukaryotic clade whose members are mostly free-living, single-celled phagotrophs. We here explore LGT across Rhizaria since their origin until modern-day representatives, using a systematic, phylogenetic approach. On average, 30% of the genes present in current-day rhizarian genomes have originated through LGT at some point during the history of Rhizaria, which emerged about one billion years ago. We show that while LGTs are outnumbered by gene duplications, transferred genes themselves duplicate frequently, thereby amplifying their impact on the recipient lineage. Strikingly, eukaryote-derived LGTs were more prevalent than prokaryotic ones, and carry distinct signatures. Altogether, we here quantitatively and qualitatively reveal how LGT affected an entire eukaryotic phylum, thereby further demystifying LGT in eukaryotes.",

Muscle takes advantage of the inherent tensor structure of the scHi-C data, and integrates this modality with DNA methylation. We developed an alternating least squares algorithm for estimating Muscle parameters and established its optimality properties.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in the genetics of schizophrenia (SCZ) have identified rare variants that confer high disease risk, including a 1.6 Mb deletion at chromosome 3q29 with a staggeringly large effect size (O.R. > 40). Understanding the impact of the 3q29 deletion (3q29Del) on the developing CNS may therefore lead to insights about the pathobiology of schizophrenia. To gain clues about the molecular and cellular perturbations caused by the 3q29 deletion, we interrogated transcriptomic effects in two experimental model systems with complementary advantages: isogenic human forebrain cortical organoids and isocortex from the 3q29Del mouse model. We first created isogenic lines by engineering the full 3q29Del into an induced pluripotent stem cell line from a neurotypical individual. We profiled transcriptomes from isogenic cortical organoids that were aged for 2 months and 12 months, as well as day p7 perinatal mouse isocortex, all at single cell resolution. Differential expression analysis by genotype in each cell-type cluster revealed that more than half of the differentially expressed genes identified in mouse cortex were also differentially expressed in human cortical organoids, and strong correlations were observed in mouse-human differential gene expression across most major cell-types. We systematically filtered differentially expressed genes to identify changes occurring in both model systems. Pathway analysis on this filtered gene set implicated dysregulation of mitochondrial function and energy metabolism, although the direction of the effect was dependent on developmental timepoint. Transcriptomic changes were validated at the protein level by analysis of oxidative phosphorylation protein complexes in mouse brain tissue. Assays of mitochondrial function in human heterologous cells further confirmed robust mitochondrial dysregulation in 3q29Del cells, and these effects are partially recapitulated by ablation of the 3q29Del gene PAK2. Taken together these data indicate that metabolic disruption is associated with 3q29Del and is conserved across species. These results converge with data from other rare SCZ-associated variants as well as idiopathic schizophrenia, suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction may be a significant but overlooked contributing factor to the development of psychotic disorders. This cross-species scRNA-seq analysis of the SCZ-associated 3q29 deletion reveals that this copy number variant may produce early and persistent changes in cellular metabolism that are relevant to human neurodevelopment.",

Loss of RUNX1 in GMPs increased the TLR4 coreceptor CD14 on neutrophils, which contributed to neutrophils increased inflammatory cytokine production in response to the TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharide. RUNX1 loss increased the chromatin accessibility of retrotransposons in GMPs and neutrophils and induced a type I interferon signature characterized by enriched footprints for signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT1::STAT2) and interferon regulatory factors (IRF) in opened chromatin, and increased expression of interferon-stimulated genes. The overproduction of inflammatory cytokines by neutrophils was reversed by inhibitors of type I IFN signaling.

    "abstract": "Species invasions can disrupt aquatic ecosystems by re-wiring food webs. A trophic cascade triggered by the invasion of the predatory zooplankter spiny water flea (Bythotrephes cederstromii) resulted in increased phytoplankton due to decreased zooplankton grazing. Here, we show that increased phytoplankton biomass led to an increase in lake anoxia. The temporal and spatial extent of anoxia experienced a step change increase coincident with the invasion. Anoxia was driven by phytoplankton biomass and stratification changes, and anoxic factor increased by 10 days. In particular, anoxia established more quickly following spring stratification. A shift in spring phytoplankton phenology encompassed both abundance and community composition. Diatoms (Bacillaryophyta) drove the increase in spring phytoplankton biomass, but not all phytoplankton community members increased, shifting the community composition. We infer that increased phytoplankton biomass increased labile organic matter and drove hypolimnetic oxygen consumption. These results demonstrate how a species invasion can shift lake phenology and biogeochemistry.\n\nScientific significance statementInvasive species can affect aquatic ecosystems, often by disrupting food webs. We investigated whether the invasive predatory zooplankton spiny water flea could additionally impact the biogeochemistry of a lake, specifically hypolimnetic anoxia dynamics. Using 24 years of observations spanning a spiny water flea invasion that triggered a food web-mediated increase in phytoplankton, we found that increased spring phytoplankton coincided with an earlier onset of anoxia, thereby drawing a connection between a species invasion and a shift in lake oxygen dynamics.\n\nData availability statementAll data is publicly available through the Environmental Data Initiative via identifiers referenced in the methods.

    "abstract": "House sparrow (Passer domesticus) is an important avian model for both laboratory and field-based studies of evolutionary genetics, development, neurobiology, physiology, behavior, and ecology. The current annotation of the P. domesticus genome is available at Ensembl Rapid Release site, which currently only focuses on gene set building. Here, we provide the first functional reannotation of the P. domesticus genome based on enrichment with intestinal Illumina RNA-Seq libraries. This revised annotation describes 38592 transcripts, compared to 23574 currently for Ensembl, and 14717 predicted protein-coding genes, with 96.4% complete Passeriformes lineage BUSCOs. A key improvement in this revised annotation is the definition of untranslated region (UTR) sequences, with 82.7% and 93.8% of transcripts containing 5 and 3 UTRs, respectively. Our reannotation highlights the benefits to genome annotation improvement when additional specific RNA-Seq data is available for analysis and rapid data throughput (>200 Mb h-1) is used.",

    "abstract": "The rigidity of a cells substrate or extracellular matrix plays a vital role in regulating cell and tissue functions. Polyacrylamide (PAAm) hydrogels are one of the most widely used cell culture substrates that provide a physiologically relevant range of stiffness. However, it is still arduous and time-consuming to prepare PAAm substrates in large batches for high-yield or multi-scale cell cultures. Here we present a simple method to prepare PAAm hydrogels with less time cost and easily accessible materials. The hydrogel is mechanically uniform and supports cell culture in a large batch. We further show that the stiffness of the hydrogel covers a large range of Youngs modulus and is sensed by cells, regulating various cell features including changes in cell morphology, proliferation, and contractility. This method improves reproducibility of mechanobiology studies and can be easily applied for mechanobiology research requiring large numbers of cells or experimental groups.",

Here, we introduce such a method, which takes the form of a Microbiome Response Index (MiRIx) for each antibiotic. Antibiotic-specific MiRIx values quantify the overall susceptibility of the microbiota to an antibiotic, based on databases of bacterial phenotypes and published data on intrinsic antibiotic susceptibility. We applied our approach to five published microbiome studies that carried out antibiotic interventions with vancomycin, metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin, and doxycycline. We show how MiRIx can be used in conjunction with existing microbiome analytical approaches to gain a deeper understanding of the microbiome response to antibiotics. Finally, we generate antibiotic response predictions for the oral, skin, and gut microbiome in healthy humans. Our approach is implemented as open-source software and is readily applied to microbiome data sets generated by 16S rRNA marker gene sequencing or shotgun metagenomics.",

    "abstract": "Interaction strength and localization are critical parameters controlling the single-chain and condensed-state properties of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Here, we decipher these relationships using coarse-grained heteropolymers comprised of hydrophobic (H) and polar (P) monomers as model IDPs. We systematically vary the fraction of P monomers XP and employ two distinct particle-based models that include either strong localized attractions between only H-H pairs (HP model) or weak distributed attractions between both H-H and H-P pairs (HP+ model). To compare different sequences and models, we first carefully tune the attraction strength for all sequences to match the single-chain radius of gyration. Interestingly, we find that this procedure produces similar conformational ensembles, nonbonded potential energies, and chain-level dynamics for single chains of almost all sequences in both models, with some deviations for the HP model at large XP. However, we observe a surprisingly rich phase behavior for the sequences in both models that deviates from the expectation that similarity at the single-chain level will translate to similar phase-separation propensity. Coexistence between dilute and dense phases is only observed up to a model-dependent XP despite the presence of favorable interchain interactions, which we quantify using the second virial coefficient. Instead, the limited number of attractive sites (H monomers) leads to the self-assembly of finite-sized clusters of different sizes depending on XP. Our findings strongly suggest that models with distributed interactions favor the formation of liquid-like condensates over a much larger range of sequence compositions compared to models with localized interactions.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsic and acquired resistance limit the window of effectiveness for oncogene-targeted cancer therapies. Preclinical studies that identify synergistic combinations enhance therapeutic efficacy to target intrinsic resistance, however, methods to study acquired resistance in cell culture are lacking. Here, we describe an in situ resistance assay (ISRA), performed in a 96-well culture format, that models acquired resistance to RTK/RAS pathway targeted therapies. Using osimertinib resistance in EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) as a model system, we show acquired resistance can be reliably modeled across cell lines with objectively defined osimertinib doses. We further show that acquired osimertinib resistance can be significantly delayed by inhibition of proximal RTK signaling using two distinct SHP2 inhibitors. Similar to patient populations, isolated osimertinib-resistant populations showed resistance via enhanced activation of multiple parallel RTKs so that individual RTK inhibitors did not re-sensitize cells to osimertinib. In contrast, inhibition of proximal RTK signaling using the SHP2 inhibitor RMC-4550 both re-sensitized resistant populations to osimertinib. Similar, objectively defined drug doses were used to model resistance to additional RTK/RAS pathway targeted therapies including the KRASG12C inhibitors adagrasib and sotorasib, the MEK inhibitor trametinib, and the farnesyl transferase inhibitor tipifarnib. These studies highlight the tractability of in situ resistance assays to model acquired resistance to targeted therapies and provide a framework for assessing the extent to which synergistic drug combinations can target acquired drug resistance.\n\nHighlightsO_LIAcquired resistance to RTK/RAS pathway members can be modeled in situ\nC_LIO_LISHP2 inhibitors reduce the development of acquired osimertinib resistance\nC_LIO_LIIsolated osimertinib-resistant populations show hyperactivation of multiple RTKs\nC_LIO_LISHP2 inhibitors re-sensitize resistant populations to osimertinib treatment\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The enrichment of peri-cancerous adipocytes is one of the distinctive features of colorectal cancer (CRC), which accelerates the disease progression and worsens the prognosis. The communication between tumor cells and adjacent adipocytes plays an important role in this process. However, the detailed mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrated MIIP is downregulated in high-grade CRC, and revealed its role and mechanism in tumor cell-adipocyte communication. By detecting MIIP expression in CRC tissues and adjacent normal tissues, we found MIIP was significantly decreased in CRC, and was closely related to adjacent adipocytes browning. In detail, MIIP reduction altered the N-linked glycosylation modification of AZGP1 and thus alleviated the inhibition of secretion. AZGP1, a critical lipid mobilization factor, led to the intensification of adipocytes browning and the release of free fatty acids (FFAs), which in turn fueled for CRC progression. Our data demonstrate that MIIP plays a key regulatory role in the communication between CRC and neighboring adipocytes by mediating AZGP1 secretion, and MIIP reduction leads to adipose browning-induced cancer rapid progression and poor prognosis.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) is a precursor to pancreatic cancer and represents a critical opportunity for cancer interception. However, the number, size, shape, and connectivity of PanINs in human pancreatic tissue samples are largely unknown. In this study, we quantitatively assessed human PanINs using CODA, a novel machine-learning pipeline for 3D image analysis that generates quantifiable models of large pieces of human pancreas with single-cell resolution. Using a cohort of 38 large slabs of grossly normal human pancreas from surgical resection specimens, we identified striking multifocality of PanINs, with a mean burden of 13 spatially separate PanINs per cm3 of sampled tissue. Extrapolating this burden to the entire pancreas suggested a median of approximately 1000 PanINs in an entire pancreas. In order to better understand the clonal relationships within and between PanINs, we developed a pipeline for CODA-guided multi-region genomic analysis of PanINs, including targeted and whole exome sequencing. Multi-region assessment of 37 PanINs from eight additional human pancreatic tissue slabs revealed that almost all PanINs contained hotspot mutations in the oncogene KRAS, but no gene other than KRAS was altered in more than 20% of the analyzed PanINs. PanINs contained a mean of 13 somatic mutations per region when analyzed by whole exome sequencing. The majority of analyzed PanINs originated from independent clonal events, with distinct somatic mutation profiles between PanINs in the same tissue slab. A subset of the analyzed PanINs contained multiple KRAS mutations, suggesting a polyclonal origin even in PanINs that are contiguous by rigorous 3D assessment. This study leverages a novel 3D genomic mapping approach to describe, for the first time, the spatial and genetic multifocality of human PanINs, providing important insights into the initiation and progression of pancreatic neoplasia.",

    "abstract": "New drugs targeting multiple stages of the malaria-causing parasite, Plasmodium, are needed to reduce and eliminate malaria worldwide. N-Myristoyltransferase (NMT) is an essential eukaryotic enzyme, and a validated chemically tractable drug target for malaria. Previous efforts have failed to target NMT owing to the low selectivity for the Plasmodium enzyme compared with human NMTs. Herein, we applied a structure-guided approach using previously reported NMT inhibitors as scaffolds to develop a new generation of Plasmodium vivax NMT (PvNMT) targeting compounds. We report a series of compounds with IC50 values in the nM range and an order of magnitude improved selectivity to Plasmodium NMT over human NMT (HsNMT). X-ray co-crystallization of PvNMT with a representative lead compound, 12b, supported the prevailing hypothesis that a conformational difference in a key tyrosine residue of PvNMT and HsNMT drives the selectivity between these enzymes. The compounds were triaged based on their selectivity for PvNMT. They significantly decreased P. falciparum blood-stage parasite load, with IC50 values ranging from 0.36 M to 1.25 M. The compounds exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of P. vivax liver stage schizont and hypnozoite infection, consistently, in three different P. vivax isolates with IC50 values ranging from 2.2 M to 6 M and from 1.2 M to 12 M. Our data provide evidence that NMT inhibitors could be multistage antimalarials, targeting both dormant and developing liver stage parasites, which is essential for malaria elimination.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryPotent and selective N-myristoyltransferase inhibitors of Plasmodium vivax hypnozoites and schizonts were synthesized and tested.",

    "abstract": "Social isolation is a potent form of psychosocial stress and is a growing public health concern, particularly among older adults. Even prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has significantly increased the prevalence of isolation and loneliness, researchers have been concerned about a rising \"epidemic\" of loneliness. Isolation is associated with an increased risk for many physical and mental health disorders and increased overall mortality risk. In addition to social isolation, older adults are also at greater risk for osteoporosis and related fractures. While researchers have investigated the negative effects of other forms of psychosocial stress on bone, including depression and PTSD, the effects of social isolation on bone have not been thoroughly investigated. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that social isolation would lead to bone loss in male and female C57BL/6J mice. 16-week-old mice were randomized into social isolation (1 mouse/cage) or grouped housing (4 mice/cage) for four weeks (N=16/group). Social isolation significantly decreased trabecular (BV/TV, BMD, Tb. N., Tb. Th.) and cortical bone (Ct.Th., Ct.Ar., Ct.Ar./Tt.Ar., pMOI, Ct.Por.) parameters in male, but not female mice. Isolated male mice had signs of reduced bone remodeling represented by reduced osteoblast numbers, osteoblast-related gene expression and osteoclast-related gene expression. However, isolated females had increased bone resorption-related gene expression, without any change in bone mass. Overall, our data suggest that social isolation has negative effects on bone in males, but not females, although females showed suggestive effects on bone resorption. These results provide critical insight into the effects of isolation on bone and have key clinical implications as we grapple with the long-term health impacts of the rise in social isolation related to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "During salt stress, the root system architecture of a plant is important for survival. Different accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana have adopted different strategies in remodeling their root architecture during salt stress. Salt induces a multiphase growth response in roots, consisting of a stop phase, quiescent phase, recovery phase and eventually a new level of homeostasis. We explored natural variation in the length of and growth rate during these phases in both main and lateral roots and find that some accessions lack the quiescent phase. Using mathematical models and correlation-based network, allowed us to correlate dynamic traits to overall root architecture and discover that both the main root growth rate during homeostasis and lateral root appearance are the strongest determinants of overall root architecture. In addition, this approach revealed a trade-off between investing in main or lateral root length during salt stress. By studying natural variation in high-resolution temporal root growth using mathematical modeling, we gained new insights in the interactions between dynamic root growth traits and we identified key traits that modulate overall root architecture during salt stress.\n\nSummary statementBy studying natural variation in salt-induced root growth phases in Arabidopsis, we show that main root growth rate during homeostasis and lateral root appearance contribute most to root architecture and we reveal a trade-off between investing in main and lateral root growth during salt stress.",

    "abstract": "The ability to control the expression of a therapeutic gene or a transgene in mammalian cells is crucial for safe and efficacious gene and cell therapy, as well as for elucidating the function of a specific gene product. Yet current mammalian gene regulation systems either evoke harmful immune responses in hosts or lack the required regulatory efficiency. Here we describe a highly responsive RNA-based molecular switch, the pA regulator, that harnesses the power of polyA signal cleavage within the 5 UTR to control mammalian gene expression. The pA regulator is governed by a  dual mechanism to ensure maximal control of gene expression: (1) aptamer clamping of polyA signal via drug binding and (2) drug-induced alternative splicing that removes the polyA signal. The metholology achieves an induction efficiency up to 900-fold with an EC50 of 0.5g/ml Tetracycline, a drug concentration that falls well within the FDA-approved dose range. The pA regulator circumvents the immune responses that plague other systems by eliminating the use of a regulatory foreign protein and the need to change transgene coding sequences. Furthermore, it is not dependent on any specific promoter, therefore the system is simple to implement in a single non-viral or viral vector. In a mouse study using AAV-mediated gene transfer, we showed that the pA regulator controlled transgene expression in a \"dose-dependent and \"reversible\" manner and exhibited long-term stability in vivo, in which both features are crucial for effective therapeutics. The pA regulator is the first non-immunogenic system that demonstrates an EC50 at a drug concentration approved by FDA, making it a clinically relevant gene regulation system that could open a new window of opportunity in clinical applications as well as biological studies.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in neurotechnology enable exciting new experiments, including novel paradigms such as closed-loop optogenetic control that achieve powerful causal interventions. At the same time, improved computational models are capable of reproducing behavior and neural activity with increasing fidelity. However, the complexities of these advances can make it difficult to reap the benefits of bridging model and experiment, such as in-silico experiment prototyping or direct comparison of model output to experimental data. We can bridge this gap more effectively by incorporating the simulation of the experimental interface into our models, but no existing tool integrates optogenetics, electrode recording, and flexible closed-loop processing with neural population simulations. To address this need, we have developed the Closed-Loop, Electrophysiology, and Optogenetics experiment simulation testbed (Cleo). Cleo is a Python package built on the Brian 2 simulator enabling injection of recording and stimulation devices as well as closed-loop control with realistic latency into a spiking neural network model. Here we describe the design, features, and use of Cleo, including validation of the individual system components. We further demonstrate its utility in three case studies using a variety of existing models and discuss potential applications for advancing causal neuroscience.",

    "abstract": "Memories initially formed in hippocampus gradually stabilize to cortex, over weeks-to-months, for long-term storage. The mechanistic details of this brain re-organization process remain poorly understood. In this study, we developed a virtual-reality based behavioral task and observed neural activity patterns associated with memory reorganization and stabilization over weeks-long timescales. Initial photometry recordings in circuits that link hippocampus and cortex revealed a unique and prominent neural correlate of memory in anterior thalamus that emerged in training and persisted for several weeks. Inhibition of the anteromedial thalamus-to-anterior cingulate cortex projections during training resulted in substantial memory consolidation deficits, and gain amplification more strikingly, was sufficient to enhance consolidation of otherwise unconsolidated memories. To provide mechanistic insights, we developed a new behavioral task where mice form two memories, of which only the more salient memory is consolidated, and also a technology for simultaneous and longitudinal cellular resolution imaging of hippocampus, thalamus, and cortex throughout the consolidation window. We found that whereas hippocampus equally encodes multiple memories, the anteromedial thalamus forms preferential tuning to salient memories, and establishes inter-regional correlations with cortex, that are critical for synchronizing and stabilizing cortical representations at remote time. Indeed, inhibition of this thalamo-cortical circuit while imaging in cortex reveals loss of contextual tuning and ensemble synchrony in anterior cingulate, together with behavioral deficits in remote memory retrieval. We thus identify a thalamo-cortical circuit that gates memory consolidation and propose a mechanism suitable for the selection and stabilization of hippocampal memories into longer term cortical storage.",

    "abstract": "The cumulative effects of T cell receptor (TCR) signal transduction over extended periods of time influences T cell biology, such as the positive selection of immature thymocytes or the proliferative responses of naive T cells. Naive T cells experience recurrent TCR signaling in response to self-antigens in the steady state. However, how these signals influence the responsiveness of naive CD8+ T cells to subsequent agonist TCR stimulation remains incompletely understood. We investigated how naive CD8+ T cells that experienced relatively low or high levels of TCR signaling in response to self-antigens respond to stimulation with foreign antigens. A transcriptional reporter of Nr4a1 (Nur77-GFP) revealed substantial heterogeneity of the amount of TCR signaling naive CD8+ T cells accumulate in the steady state. Nur77-GFPHI cells exhibited diminished T cell activation and secretion of IFN{gamma} and IL-2 relative to Nur77-GFPLO cells in response to agonist TCR stimulation. Differential gene expression analyses revealed upregulation of genes associated with acutely stimulated T cells in Nur77-GFPHI cells but also increased expression of negative regulators such as the phosphatase Sts1. Responsiveness of Nur77-GFPHI cells to TCR stimulation was partially restored at the level of IFN{gamma} secretion by deficiency of Sts1 or the ubiquitin ligase Cbl-b. Our data suggest that extensive accumulation of TCR signaling during steady state conditions induces a recalibration of the responsiveness of naive CD8+ T cells through gene expression changes and negative regulation, at least in part, dependent on Sts1 and Cbl-b. This cell-intrinsic negative feedback loop may allow the immune system to limit the autoreactive potential of highly self-reactive naive CD8+ T cells.",

We aimed to define such LPS-induced aggregates and the functional consequences of protein aggregation using a combination of mass spectrometry analyses, biochemical imaging, and experimental animal models. We show that such wound-fluid aggregates contain a multitude of protein classes, including sequences from coagulation factors, annexins, histones, antimicrobial proteins/peptides, and apolipoproteins. Proteins and peptides with a high aggregation propensity were identified, and selected components were verified biochemically by western blot analysis. Staining by thioflavin T and the Amytracker probe demonstrated the presence of amyloid-like aggregates formed after exposure to LPS in vitro in human wound fluid and in vivo in porcine wound models. Using NF-{kappa}B-reporter mice and IVIS bioimaging, we show that such wound-fluid LPS aggregates induce a significant reduction in local inflammation compared with LPS in plasma. The results show that protein/peptide aggregation is a mechanism for confining LPS and reducing inflammation and further underscore the connection between host defense and amyloidogenesis.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveInflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are complex disorders. Iron accumulates in the inflamed tissue of IBD patients, yet neither a mechanism for the accumulation nor its implication on the course of inflammation are known. We hypothesized that the inflammation modifies iron homeostasis, affects tissue iron distribution and that this in turn perpetuates the inflammation.\n\nDesignThis study analyzed human biopsies, animal models and cellular systems to decipher the role of iron homeostasis in IBD.\n\nResultsWe found inflammation-mediated modifications of iron distribution, and iron-decoupled activation of the iron regulatory protein (IRP)1. To understand the role of IRP1 in the course of this inflammation-associated iron pattern, a novel cellular co-culture model was established, that replicated the iron-pattern observed in vivo, and supported involvement of nitric oxide in the activation of IRP1 and the typical iron pattern in inflammation. Importantly, deletion of IRP1 from an IBD mouse model completely abolished both, the misdistribution of iron and intestinal inflammation.\n\nConclusionThese findings suggest that IRP1 plays a central role in the coordination of the inflammatory response in the intestinal mucosa and that it is a viable candidate for therapeutic intervention in IBD.\n\nWhat is already known on this topicInflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic conditions that cause inflammation in the digestive tract. Iron accumulation is a common feature of IBD, but the mechanism of accumulation and its implications for the course of inflammation are not fully understood.\n\nWhat this study addsThis study reveals an inflammatory intestinal iron distribution-pattern, that has not been described previously involving iron accumulation in immune cells and iron deficiency in epithelial cells. We show that an inflammation mediated activation of the Iron Regulatory Protein (IRP)1 is responsible for this inflammatory iron pattern and that this drives the propagation of the inflammation in IBD. Moreover, targeted deletion of IRP1 completely abolished the intestinal inflammation.\n\nHow this study might affect research, practice or policyThese findings suggest that IRP1 plays a central role in the coordination of the inflammatory response in the intestinal mucosa in IBD. This might lead to the development of novel treatment approaches for IBD focused on modulating IRP1 activity.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities are fundamental components of most ecosystems but little is known about the interactions that structure them. Metagenomic data have revolutionized our understanding of complex consortia, yet predicted interactions are rarely explored experimentally. We developed an organism abundance correlation network to investigate factors that control community organization in soil-derived laboratory microbial consortia grown under dozens of conditions. The network was overlaid with metagenomic information about functional capacities to generate testable hypotheses. We developed a metric to predict the importance of each node within its local network environments relative to correlated vitamin auxotrophs and predicted that a Variovorax species is a hub because it is a highly important source of thiamine. Quantification of thiamine during the growth of Variovorax in minimal media conditions showed extraordinarily high levels of production of thiamine, up to 100 mg/L. This over-production of thiamine explains why the auxotrophs correlated with Variovorax are reliant on this organism for thiamine, despite the presence of other predicted thiamine producers in the community. A few of these thiamine auxotrophs are predicted to produce pantothenate that we show that Variovorax requires to grow, implying that a subset of vitamin-dependent interactions are mutualistic. We found that Cryptococcus produces the B-vitamin pantothenate, and co-cultures led to a 90-130-fold fitness increase for both Cryptococcus and Variovorax. This study demonstrates the predictive power of metagenome-informed, microbial consortia-based network analyses for identifying microbial interactions that underpin the structure and functioning of microbial communities.",

    "abstract": "HIV-1 envelope (Env) exhibits distinct conformational changes in response to host receptor (CD4) engagement. Env, a trimer of gp120/gp41 heterodimers, has been structurally characterized in a closed, prefusion conformation with closely associated gp120s and coreceptor binding sites on gp120 V3 hidden by V1V2 loops, and in fully-saturated CD4-bound open Env conformations with changes including outwardly rotated gp120s and displaced V1V2 loops. To investigate changes resulting from sub-stoichiometric CD4 binding, we solved 3.4[A] and 3.9[A] single-particle cryo-EM structures of soluble, native-like Envs bound to one or two CD4 molecules. Env trimer bound to one CD4 adopted the closed, prefusion Env state. When bound to two CD4s, the CD4-bound gp120s exhibited an open Env conformation including a four-stranded gp120 bridging sheet and displaced gp120 V1V2 loops that expose the coreceptor sites on V3. The third gp120 adopted an intermediate, occluded-open state that included gp120 outward rotation but maintained the prefusion, three-stranded gp120 bridging sheet and showed only partial V1V2 displacement and V3 exposure. We conclude that engagement of one CD4 molecule was insufficient to stimulate CD4-induced conformational changes, while binding two CD4 molecules led to Env opening in CD4-bound protomers only. Together, these results illuminate HIV-1 Env intermediate conformations and illustrate the structural plasticity of HIV-1 Env.",

    "abstract": "Splicing requires the tight coordination of dynamic spliceosomal RNAs and proteins. U6 is the only spliceosomal RNA transcribed by RNA Polymerase III and undergoes an extensive maturation process. In humans and fission yeast, this includes addition of a 5 {gamma}-monomethyl phosphate cap by members of the Bin3/MePCE family. Previously, we have shown that the Bin3/MePCE homolog Bmc1 is recruited to the S. pombe telomerase holoenzyme by the LARP7 family protein Pof8, where it acts in a catalytic-independent manner to protect the telomerase RNA and facilitate holoenzyme assembly. Here, we show that Bmc1 and Pof8 also interact in a U6-containing snRNP. We demonstrate that Bmc1 and Pof8 promote 2-O-methylation of U6 and identify and characterize a non-canonical snoRNA that guides this methylation. Further, we show that fission yeast strains deleted of Bmc1 or Pof8 show altered U6 snRNP assembly patterns, supporting a more general role for these factors in guiding noncoding RNP assembly beyond the telomerase RNP. These results are thus consistent with a novel role for Bmc1/MePCE family members in stimulating U6 post-transcriptional modifications.",

Thus, the centriole organelle is contributed solely by the sperm to the zygote in most systems. Whereas centrioles can have a stereotyped distribution during some asymmetric divisions, whether sperm-contributed centrioles are distributed in a stereotyped manner in the resulting embryo is not known. Here, we addressed this question in Caenorhabditis elegans using marked mating experiments, whereby the presence of sperm-contributed centrioles is monitored in the resulting embryos using the stable centriolar component SAS-4::GFP, as well as GFP::SAS-7. Our analysis demonstrates that the distribution of sperm-contributed centrioles is stochastic in 4-cell stage embryos. Moreover, using sperm from zyg-1 mutant males that harbor a single centriole, we show that the older sperm-contributed centriole is also distributed stochastically in the resulting embryo. Overall, we conclude that in contrast to the situation during some asymmetric cell divisions, centrioles contributed by the male germ line are distributed stochastically in embryos of C. elegans.",

    "abstract": "The proper timing of mRNA translation is crucial across many biological systems for processes such as intercellular communication, body pattern formation, and morphogenesis. The main D. melanogaster posterior determinant, oskar, is maternally transcribed, but only translated when properly localized at the oocytes posterior cortex. Bruno 1 and Cup are two effector proteins known to participate in multiple aspects of oskar mRNA regulation. Current model describes a mechanism in which Bruno 1 is necessary for Cups recruitment to oskar mRNA, and Bruno 1 is indispensable for its translational repression. Here, we reveal that the Bruno 1-Cup interaction, as well as their interdependent influence on each others mRNA and protein expression, lead to precise oskar mRNA regulation during early oogenesis. We show that these factors stably associate with the oskar mRNA in vivo, but surprisingly, Bruno 1s stable association with oskar mRNA depends on Cup, while Bruno 1 is not necessary for Cup association to oskar mRNA. During early oogenesis, Cup, not Bruno 1, is the essential factor for oskar mRNA repression. Cup is a crucial P-body member that maintains proper P-body morphology during oogenesis, as well as it is necessary for oskar mRNAs association with P-bodies, thus driving the translational repression and stability of oskar mRNA. Our experimental results collectively suggest a regulatory mechanism where a feedback loop between Bruno 1 and Cup coordinates oskar mRNA regulation in the egg chamber allowing for proper development to occur.",

    "abstract": "Introduced species can have profound impacts on communities by displacing and consuming native species. The intertidal communities in the Gulf of Maine have been radically altered through a suite of invasions including the herbivorous snail Littorina littorea and the omnivorous crab Carcinus maenas leading to morphological and spatial distribution changes in two native gastropod grazers (Littorina saxatilis and Littorina obtusata). Subsequently, another intertidal omnivorous crab Hemigrapsus sanguineus has become abundant in the intertidal, occurring in areas which were once refuges from crab predation. In order to quantify the potential impact of H. sanguineus on native snails, we conducted both in and ex situ experiments, testing the susceptibility of different sized snails to predation by introduced crabs. Additionally, we measured the distribution, abundance, and morphology of intertidal snails and crabs. Smaller snails of all species were the most susceptible to predation, although susceptibility differed among snail species. Littorina saxatilis was the most vulnerable to predation, with 73 and 64% of the population susceptible to large H. sanguineus and small C. maenas, respectively, while more than 89% of the L. littorea population was resistant to predation. Littorina saxatilis has been relegated to the high intertidal where there is high abiotic stress and poor-quality food, but until the invasion of H. sanguineus, there was little predation risk. Now, it seems that L. saxatilis is at the most risk of all three snail species, and may be at threat of local extirpation at locations with high populations of H. sanguineus.",

Groups A and D served as normal and cyclophosphamide control respectively and were fed standard rat chow, groups B and E were fed quercetin supplemented diet (100 mg/kg of feed), while those in groups C and F were fed quercetin supplemented diet at 200 mg/kg of feed. Animals in group A-C also received intraperitoneal normal saline on days 1 and 2, while those in groups D-F got intraperitoneal cyclophosphamide (150 mg/kg/day on days 1 and 2). Standard diet and quercetin supplemented diet were administered daily for 21 days. At the end of the experimental period, behavioural tests were carried out, following which animals were sacrificed and blood taken for the assessment of biochemical parameters. Organs were either homogenised or processed for histological study.\n\nResultsQuercetin mitigated CYP-induced weight loss and reduction in food consumption. It also improved total antioxidant capacity while reducing CYP-induced lipid peroxidation and biochemical markers of impaired liver function. A reduction in CYP-induced increase in urea and creatinine was also observed. Interleukin-10 increased, while the CYP-induced increase in interleukin-1 beta and TNF- were also mitigated following quercetin administration. Open field exploratory activities and grooming increased with CYP and the lowest dose of quercetin. The anxiolytic effects of quercetin was demonstrable in the elevated plus maze; while its memory-enhancing effects were seen in the Y-maze and radial-arm maze. Finally, quercetin improved acetylcholine/dopamine levels and brain-derived neurotropic factor, while reducing serotonin levels and astrocyte immunoreactivity.\n\nConclusionThe results show quercetins ability to protect against CYP-induced changes in rats. They also highlight the possible use of quercetin as a possible adjunct in cancer chemotherapy-induced tissue damage. However, further research will be needed to delineate its exact role in cancer chemotherapy.",
