    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the pathogenic bacterium that causes tuberculosis, has evolved sophisticated defense mechanisms to counteract the cytotoxicity of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated within host macrophages during infection. The melH gene in Mtb and Mycobacteriummarinum (Mm) plays a crucial role in defense mechanisms against ROS generated during infection. We demonstrate that melH encodes an epoxide hydrolase and contributes to ROS detoxification. Deletion of melH in Mm resulted in a mutant with increased sensitivity to oxidative stress, a minor increase in the bacterium's sensitivity to NO exposure. This heightened vulnerability is attributed to the increased expression of whiB3, subsequently leading to decreased production of mycothiol and ergothioneine. Our study elucidated profound effects on the bioenergetic metabolism of Mm upon disruption of melH. The absence of melH resulted in reduced intracellular levels of NAD+, NADH, and ATP, and accumulation of aldehydes within Mm. Bacterial growth was impaired, even in the absence of external stressors, and was carbon-source-dependent. Taken together, these results highlight the essential role of melH in mycobacterial metabolism and provide new insights into the complex interplay between redox homeostasis and carbon utilization in mycobacteria.",

    "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, humanity temporarily retired from the outdoors. The strict lockdown measures in Spain coincided with the onset of the nesting season of birds, thriving in an unusually quiet environment. Here, we have recorded in forests near San Lorenzo de El Escorial (Central Spain) during the lockdown period in 2020, and the closer to normal spring in 2021. We found strong differences in soundscapes by recording year and location, regardless of the effects of meteorology and human mobility. Species altered their behaviour by increasing their calling intensity during 2021 to cope with higher noise levels, however, acoustic activity was generally less diverse and complex. The difference between years was particularly detrimental for the highest-pitched biophony in 2021. We interpret that an extreme snowfall, Filomena, may have caused a mortality event with lasting effects in the community during the 2021 spring. Since extreme climatic events are likely going to keep happening in the area due to climate change, our data is a useful baseline to guide future conservation efforts, and examine how our activity and climate change are changing the soundscapes of Spanish Mediterranean forests.",

    "abstract": "Behaviour-modifying chemicals mediate sexual communication and host choice in insect herbivores. Sex pheromones are believed to attract insects by themselves, even though they are released into an atmosphere of plant odorants. We show for the first time that, in codling moth, feeding on apple and pear, that female pheromone is efficient for male attraction only in the presence of host plant odour. In non-host vegetation, male attraction to sex pheromone was very strongly reduced. The role of host odour in sex attraction was then substantiated by blending synthetic pheromone, codlemone, and the kairomone pear ester, a strong host plant attractant. An admixture of pear ester entirely rescued pheromone attraction in non-host vegetation. This field behavioural assay substantiates that host plant olfactory cues are integral part of sexual communication and mate recognition, which provides a mechanism for how shifts to new host plants produce new mate recognition signals.",

    "abstract": "Chromosomal inversion polymorphisms can be common, but the causes of their persistence are often unclear. We propose a model for the maintenance of inversion polymorphism, which requires that some variants contribute antagonistically to two phenotypes, one of which has negative frequency-dependent fitness. These conditions yield a form of frequency-dependent disruptive selection, favoring two predominant haplotypes segregating alleles that favor opposing antagonistic phenotypes. An inversion associated with one haplotype can reduce the fitness load incurred by generating recombinant offspring, reinforcing its linkage to the haplotype and enabling both haplotypes to accumulate more antagonistic variants than expected otherwise. We develop and apply a forward simulator to examine these dynamics under a tradeoff between survival and male display. These simulations indeed generate inversion-associated haplotypes with opposing sex-specific fitness effects. Antagonism strengthens with time, and can ultimately yield karyotypes at surprisingly predictable frequencies, with striking genotype frequency differences between sexes and between developmental stages. To test whether this model may contribute to well-studied yet enigmatic inversion polymorphisms in Drosophila melanogaster, we track inversion frequencies in laboratory crosses to test whether they influence male reproductive success or survival. We find that two of the four tested inversions show significant evidence for the tradeoff examined, with In(3R)K favoring survival and In(3L)Ok favoring male reproduction. Additionally, all inversions show survival differences between sexes, and paternal success depends on maternal genotype. Based on this work, we expect that balancing selection on antagonistically pleiotropic traits may provide a significant and underappreciated contribution to the maintenance of natural inversion polymorphism.",

    "abstract": "Background: The duplication-triplication/inverted-duplication (DUP-TRP/INV-DUP) structure is a type of complex genomic rearrangement (CGR) hypothesized to result from replicative repair of DNA due to replication fork collapse. It is often mediated by a pair of inverted low-copy repeats (LCR) followed by iterative template switches resulting in at least two breakpoint junctions in cis. Although it has been identified as an important mutation signature of pathogenicity for genomic disorders and cancer genomes, its architecture remains unresolved and is predicted to display at least four structural variation (SV) haplotypes. Results: Here we studied the genomic architecture of DUP-TRP/INV-DUP by investigating the genomic DNA of 24 patients with neurodevelopmental disorders identified by array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) on whom we found evidence for the existence of 4 out of 4 predicted SV haplotypes. Using a combination of short-read genome sequencing (GS), long-read GS, optical genome mapping and StrandSeq the haplotype structure was resolved in 18 samples. This approach refined the point of template switching between inverted LCRs in 4 samples revealing a DNA segment of ~2.2-5.5 kb of 100% nucleotide similarity. A prediction model was developed to infer the LCR used to mediate the non-allelic homology repair. Conclusions: These data provide experimental evidence supporting the hypothesis that inverted LCRs act as a recombinant substrate in replication-based repair mechanisms. Such inverted repeats are particularly relevant for formation of copy-number associated inversions, including the DUP-TRP/INV-DUP structures. Moreover, this type of CGR can result in multiple conformers which contributes to generate diverse SV haplotypes in susceptible loci.",

    "abstract": "So far SNP heritability (h2SNP;variance explained by all SNP s used in genome-wide association study) has explained most of genetic variation for many traits but still there is a gap between GWAS heritability (h2GWAS; variance explained by genome-wide significant SNPs) and h2SNP that is named hidden heritability. There are several methods for estimating h2GWAS (linear_mixed_model (LMM), PRS, multiple_linear_regression (MLR) and simple_linear_regression(SLR)). However, it is unclear which methods are more accurate under different circumstances. This study proposes a PRS based method for estimating h2GWAS that uses pseudo summary statistics. It compares this method with existing methods using both simulated and real data (10 traits from UKBB) to determine when they are realistic and can be trusted as a final estimate. Simulation results showed that PRS-based methods underestimate h2GWAS near 20% when considering all causal SNPs. But they are relatively accurate when using a subset of causal SNPs. Their performance is much better than SLR method for all 10 traits, although when applied to real data, they do not follow a stable trend of overestimation or underestimation compared to the base model (LMM). My suggestion is to use LMM or adjusted_R2 from MLR for reporting h2GWAS when an independent data set is available. In cases where only summary statistics is available, the PRS-PSS is relatively an accurate alternative, especially compared to SLR, which tends to overestimate h2GWAS by 20-50% when applying it on real data.",

    "abstract": "Human brains typically grow through development, then remain the same size in adulthood, and often shrink through age-related degeneration that induces cognitive decline and impaired functionality. In most cases, however, the neural and organismal changes that accompany shrinkage, especially early in the process, remain unknown. Paralleling neurodegenerative phenotypes, the Eurasian common shrew Sorex araneus, shrinks its brain in autumn through winter, but then reverses this process by rapidly regrowing the brain come spring. To identify the molecular underpinnings and parallels to human neurodegeneration of this unique brain size change, we analyzed multi-organ, season-specific transcriptomics and metabolomic data. Simultaneous with brain shrinkage, we discovered system-wide metabolic shifts from lipid to glucose metabolism, as well as neuroprotection of brain metabolic homeostasis through reduced cholesterol efflux. These mechanisms rely on a finely tuned brain-liver crosstalk that results in changes in expression of human markers of aging and neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. We propose metabolic shifts with signals that cross the brain blood barrier are central to seasonal brain size changes in S. araneus, with potential implications for therapeutic treatment of human neurodegeneration.",

MDD-associated accessibility alterations were prominent in deep-layer excitatory neurons characterized by transcription factor (TF) motif accessibility and binding of nuclear receptor (NR)4A2, an activity-dependent TF responsive to pathological stress. The same neurons were significantly enriched for MDD-associated genetic variation disrupting cis-regulatory sites and TF binding associated with genes involved in synaptic communication. Furthermore, a grey matter microglial cluster exhibited differentially closed chromatin in MDD affecting binding sites bound by TFs known to regulate immune homeostasis.

We recorded social associations and aggressive interactions in a highly social, large-brained parrot, the sulphur-crested cockatoo (Cacatua galerita). By following 411 individuals across three neighbouring roosts, we show that sulphur-crested cockatoos form shallow, but stable, hierarchies that incorporate birds from within and outside the roost. We find that hierarchies are maintained via a two-fold strategy when initiating or reacting to an aggression: initiate and escalate interactions based on rank difference when familiar, and direct and escalate interactions based on weight similarity when unfamiliar. Our results demonstrate the association between complex cognition, social memory, and the maintenance of dominance hierarchies in fission-fusion systems.",

    "abstract": "T cell receptors (TCR) recognize antigens on the surface of T cells, which is the critical event in the adaptive immune response to infection and vaccination. The ability to determine TCR-antigen recognition would benefit research in basic immunology and therapeutics. High-throughput experimental approaches for determining TCR-antigen specificity have produced valuable data, but the TCR-antigen pairing space is astronomically more significant than what can reached by experiments. Here, we describe a computational method for predicting TCR-antigen recognition, SABRE (Self-Attention-based Transformer Model for predicting T-cell Receptor-Epitope specificity). SABRE captures sequence properties of matching TCR and antigen pairs by self-supervised pre-training using known pairs from curated databases and large-scale experiments. It then fine-tunes by supervised learning to predict TCRs that can recognize each antigen. We showed that SABRE's AUROC reaches 0.726 for predicting TCR-epitope recognition. We meticulously designed a training and testing scheme to evaluate the model's performance on unseen TCR species: 60% of the data was allocated for training, 20% for validation, and the remaining 20% exclusively for testing. Notably, this testing set comprised entirely of TCRs not present in the training phase, ensuring a genuine assessment of the model's ability to generalize to novel data.",

    "abstract": "Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has revolutionized the field of structural biology by enabling the precise determination of large protein structures. Picking protein particles in cryo-EM micrographs (images) is a crucial step in the cryo-EM-based structure determination. However, existing methods trained on a limited amount of cryo-EM data still cannot accurately pick protein particles from complex, noisy, and heterogenous cryo-EM images. The general foundational artificial intelligence (AI)-based image segmentation model such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) trained on huge amounts of general image data cannot segment protein particles well because their training data do not include cryo-EM images. In this work, we present a novel approach (CryoSegNet) of integrating the power of the encoder and decoder-based architecture of an attention-gated U-shape network (U-Net) specially designed and trained for cryo-EM particle picking and the SAM. The U-Net is first trained on a large cryo-EM image dataset and then used to generate input from original cryo-EM images for SAM to make particle pickings. CryoSegNet shows both high precision and recall in segmenting protein particles from cryo-EM micrographs, irrespective of protein type, shape, and size. On several independent datasets of various protein types, CryoSegNet outperforms two top machine learning particle pickers crYOLO and Topaz as well as SAM itself. The average resolution of density maps reconstructed from the particles picked by CryoSegNet is 3.05 [A], 15% better than 3.60 [A] of Topaz and 49% better than 5.96 [A] of crYOLO. Therefore, CryoSegNet can be applied to enhance the resolution of protein structures constructed from both existing and new cryo-EM data.",

Methods and results: Male offspring of pigs lacking DMD exon 52 are characterized by heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF, EF 34.5{+/-}1.8% vs. 49.2{+/-}1.0% in control hearts), arrhythmogenesis due to large apical regions of reduced action potential (AP) amplitude and sudden cardiac death with a lifespan of usually less than 4 months. Slow antegrade intracoronary infusion of AAV1.SERCA2a (3x1013 virus genomes (vg) per pig) improved left ventricular ejection fraction (EF 47.3{+/-}2.0%, p<0.05) to a similar extent as germline editing of DMD{Delta}52 to DMD{Delta}51-52, inducing a Becker dystrophy (BMD) genotype (EF 46.7{+/-}3.8%). Moreover, AAV.Serca2a significantly reduced myocardial inflammation and fibrosis and areas of reduced AP amplitude. Conclusions: In DMD pigs, 3x1013vg/heart of GMP-grade AAV1.SERCA2a sufficed to normalize left ventricular function, and improved electrical vulnerability of the heart. Hence, AAV.SERCA2a may serve as a treatment option for DMD cardiomyopathy.",

    "abstract": "In a growing digital landscape, enhancing the discoverability and resonance of scientific articles is essential. Here, we offer ten recommendations to amplify the discoverability of studies in scientific databases. Particularly, we argue that the strategic use and placement of key terms in the title, abstract, and keyword sections can boost indexing and appeal. By surveying 237 journals in ecology and evolutionary biology, we found that current author guidelines may unintentionally limit article discoverability. Our survey of 5842 studies revealed that authors frequently exhaust abstract word limits - particularly those capped under 250 words. This suggests that current guidelines may be overly restrictive and not optimised to increase the dissemination and discoverability of digital publications. Additionally, 91.9% of studies used redundant keywords in the title or abstract, undermining optimal indexing in databases. We encourage adopting structured abstracts to maximise the incorporation of key terms in titles, abstracts, and keywords. In addition, we encourage the relaxation of abstract and keyword limitations in journals with strict guidelines, and the inclusion of multilingual abstracts to broaden global accessibility. These evidence-based recommendations to editors are designed to improve article engagement and facilitate evidence synthesis, thereby aligning scientific publishing with the modern needs of academic research.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the response to cancer immunotherapy remains an unmet challenge in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and other malignancies. T cells, the major target of current checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies, accumulate cholesterol during activation to support proliferation and signaling. The requirement of cholesterol for anti-tumor functions of T cells led us to hypothesize that quantifying cellular accumulation of this molecule could distinguish successful from ineffective checkpoint immunotherapy. To analyze accumulation of cholesterol by T cells in the immune microenvironment of breast cancer, we leveraged a novel positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer, FNP-59. FNP-59 is an analog of cholesterol that our group has validated as an imaging biomarker for cholesterol uptake in pre-clinical models and initial human studies. In immunocompetent mouse models of TNBC, we found that elevated uptake of exogenous labeled cholesterol analogs functions as a marker for T cell activation. When comparing immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) responsive EO771 tumors to non-responsive AT-3 tumors, we found significantly higher uptake of a fluorescent cholesterol analog in T cells of the ICI-responsive tumors both in vitro and in vivo. Using the FNP-59 radiotracer, we discovered that accumulation of cholesterol by T cells increased further in ICI responding tumors that received ant-PD-1 checkpoint immunotherapy. We verified these data by mining single cell sequencing data from patients with TNBC. Patients with tumors containing cycling T cells showed gene expression signatures of cholesterol uptake and trafficking. These results suggest that uptake of exogenous cholesterol analogs by tumor-infiltrating T cells predict T cell activation and success of ICI therapy.",

While Streptococcus agalactiae, also known as group B Streptococcus (GBS) and Escherichia coli are frequent causative pathogens of neonatal sepsis, it is still unclear how the neonatal adaptive immune system responds to these pathogens. In the present study, we find that {gamma}{delta} T cells in neonatal mice rapidly respond to single-organism sepsis infections of GBS and E. coli, and that these infections induce distinct activation and effector functions from IFN-{gamma} and IL-17 producing {gamma}{delta} T cells, respectively. We also report differential reliance on {gamma}{delta}TCR signaling to elicit effector cytokine responses during neonatal sepsis, with IL-17 production during E. coli sepsis being associated with TCR signaling, whereas IFN-{gamma} production during GBS sepsis is TCR-independent. Furthermore, we report that the divergent effector responses of {gamma}{delta} during GBS and E. coli sepsis impart distinctive neuroinflammatory phenotypes on the neonatal brain. The present study sheds light on how the neonatal adaptive immune response responds differentially to bacterial stimuli and how these responses impact neonatal sepsis-associated neuroinflammation.",

    "abstract": "Ticks rely on robust cellular and humoral immune responses to control microbial infection. However, several aspects of the tick's innate immune system remain uncharacterized, most notably that of the immune cells (called hemocytes), which are known to play a significant role in cellular and humoral responses toward microbes. Despite the importance of hemocytes in regulating microbial infection, our understanding of their basic biology and molecular mechanisms remains limited. Therefore, we believe that a more detailed understanding of the role of hemocytes in the interactions between ticks and tick-borne microbes is crucial to illuminate their function in vector competence and to help identify novel targets for developing new strategies to block tick-borne pathogen transmission. This study examined hemocytes from the lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum) at the transcriptomic level using the 10X genomics single-cell RNA sequencing platform to analyze hemocyte populations from unfed, partially blood-fed, and Ehrlichia chaffeensis-infected ticks. Our data exhibit the identification of twelve and nineteen distinct hemocyte populations, respectively, from uninfected and Ehrlichia-infected ticks. Our results show a significant increase of clusters representing granulocyte and oenocytoids populations with Ehrlichia infection. This work opens a new field of tick innate immunobiology to understand the role of hemocytes, particularly in response to prolonged blood-feeding (hematophagy) and tick-microbial interactions.",

As both Flt3L and IL-6 are critical for many aspects of hematopoiesis, we knock-out mouse Flt3 and knock-in human IL6 gene. The resulting mice showed an increase in the availability of mouse Flt3L to human cells, and a dose-dependent production of human IL-6 upon activation. Upon transplantation with low number of human HPCs from adult bone marrow, these humanized mice demonstrated a significantly higher engraftment with multilineage differentiation of human lymphoid and myeloid cells. Furthermore, higher frequencies of human lymphoid and myeloid cells were detected in tissues at one year after adult HPC transplant. Thus, these mice enable studies of human hematopoiesis and tissue colonization over time.",

    "abstract": "As the largest mucosal surface, the gut has built a physical, chemical, microbial and immune barrier to protect the body against pathogen invasion. The disturbance of gut microbiota aggravates pathogenic bacteria invasion and gut barrier injury. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a promising treatment for microbiome-related disorders, where probiotic strain engraftment is a significant factor influencing FMT outcomes. The aim of this research was to explore the effect of FMT on antibiotic-induced microbiome-disordered (AIMD) model infected with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). We used piglet, mouse and intestinal organoid models to explore the protective effects and mechanisms of FMT on ETEC infection. The results showed that FMT regulated gut microbiota and enhanced the protection of AIMD piglets against ETEC K88 challenge, as demonstrated by reduced intestinal pathogen colonization and alleviated gut barrier injury. Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) and Bacteroides fragilis (B. fragilis) were identified as two strains that may play key roles in FMT. We further investigated the alleviatory effects of these two strains on ETEC infection in AIMD mice model, which revealed that A. muciniphila and B. fragilis relieved ETEC-induced intestinal inflammation by maintaining the proportion of Treg/Th17 cells and epithelial damage by moderately activating the Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling pathway, while the effect of A. muciniphila was better than B. fragilis. We therefore identified whether A. muciniphila protected against ETEC infection using basal-out and apical-out intestinal organoid models. A. muciniphila did protect the Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells and stimulate proliferation and differentiation of intestinal epithelium, and the protective effects of A. muciniphila was reversed by Wnt inhibitor. FMT alleviated ETEC-induced gut barrier injury and intestinal inflammation in AIMD model. A. muciniphila was identified as key strain in FMT to promote proliferation and differentiation of intestinal stem cells by mediating the Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Ocean acidification, a decrease in oceanic pH resulting from the uptake of anthropogenic CO2, can be a significant stressor for marine organisms. In this study, we reared red king crab larvae from hatching to the first crab stage in four different pH treatments: current surface ambient, diel fluctuation to mimic larval migration between the surface and mixed layer under current ambient conditions, pH 7.8, and pH 7.5. Larvae were monitored throughout development and the average length of each stage was determined. At each of the zoeal stages, the glaucothoe stage, and the first crab stage, we measured survival, morphometry, dry mass, and carbon, nitrogen, calcium, and magnesium content. Red king crab larvae were highly resilient to ocean acidification. There were no differences among treatments in survival or in average stage length. Although there were clear ontogenetic trends in size, weight, and elemental composition, most of these did not vary with pH treatment. Zoeal morphology did not vary among treatments, although glaucothoe and C1 crabs were slightly smaller in pH 7.8 than in the ambient treatment. Ambient larvae also had a slightly higher mass than pH 7.8 larvae but not pH 7.5. Ambient larvae had higher magnesium contents than pH 7.8 and pH 7.5, but calcium levels were the same. Ambient larvae also had slightly lower carbon and nitrogen content than pH 7.8 and pH 7.5 larvae but only in the 4th zoeal stage. Overall this study suggests that red king crab larvae are well adapted to a wide range of pH conditions and are unlikely to be significantly affected by ocean acidification levels projected for the next two centuries.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic relationships for the genus Calliandra section Androcallis (Fabaceae) were reconstructed, including previously sequenced species from Central and South America and unexamined species from Colombia, one of Calliandra main diversity centers. Here, we generated novel DNA sequences of Calliandra species from Colombia for the nuclear Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) and the chloroplast trnL and trnL-F intergenic spacer. By incorporating a broader taxonomic sampling, the relationships among main clades in Androcallis were clarified, providing a systematics framework in which to test evolutionary hypotheses. Phylogenetic analysis recovered five well-supported clades within Androcallis. Most species within each clade had similar geographical distributions and relationships between the five major clades are strongly supported for the first time. However, core Androcallis relationships, including most species from Colombia sequenced here, remain unclear. A second goal of this study was to determine the taxonomic status of Calliandra medellinensis. This enigmatic taxon emblematic of Medellin, Colombia, is found in limited numbers within the Aburra Valley and has been proposed to be a hybrid taxon. Here, C. medellinensis, C. magdalenae and C. haematocephala were not monophyletic within the core Androcallis clade. This suggests that C. medellinensis could potentially be an interspecific hybrid between C. magdalenae and C. haematocephala, thus challenging the taxonomic status of this species; however, more informative molecular markers should be used in future studies. Specifically, genomic studies should assess interspecific hybridization demographic models. Such insights can illuminate the C. medellinensis origin, guiding conservation strategies and providing valuable evolutionary overviews.",

    "abstract": "Oxygen tension plays a key role in tissue function and pathophysiology. Oxygen-controlled cell culture, in which the oxygen concentration in an incubators gas phase is controlled, is an indispensable tool to study the role of oxygen in vivo. For this technique, it is presumed that the incubator setpoint is equal to the oxygen tension that cells experience (i.e., pericellular oxygen). We discovered that physioxic (5 percent oxygen) and hypoxic (1 percent oxygen) setpoints regularly induce anoxic (0.0 percent oxygen) pericellular tensions in both adherent and suspension cell cultures. Electron transport chain inhibition ablates this effect, indicating that cellular oxygen consumption is the driving factor. RNA-seq revealed that primary human hepatocytes cultured in physioxia experience ischemia-reperfusion injury due to anoxic exposure followed by rapid reoxygenation. To better understand the relationship between incubator gas phase and pericellular oxygen tensions, we developed a reaction-diffusion model that predicts pericellular oxygen tension a priori. This model revealed that the effect of cellular oxygen consumption is greatest in smaller volume culture vessels (e.g., 96-well plate). By controlling pericellular oxygen tension in cell culture, we discovered that MCF7 cells have stronger glycolytic and glutamine metabolism responses in anoxia vs. hypoxia. MCF7 also expressed higher levels of HIF2A, CD73, NDUFA4L2, etc. and lower levels of HIF1A, CA9, VEGFA, etc. in response to hypoxia vs. anoxia. Proteomics revealed that 4T1 cells had an upregulated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) response and downregulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) management, glycolysis, and fatty acid metabolism pathways in hypoxia vs. anoxia. Collectively, these results reveal that breast cancer cells respond non-monotonically to low oxygen, suggesting that anoxic cell culture is not suitable to model hypoxia. We demonstrate that controlling atmospheric oxygen tension in cell culture incubators is insufficient to control oxygen in cell culture and introduce the concept of pericellular oxygen-controlled cell culture.",

However, the mechanisms governing SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism and its effects on long-term behavioral changes remain poorly understood. Using a highly virulent mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain, denoted as SARS2-N501YMA30, we demonstrated that intranasal inoculation of SARS2-N501YMA30 results in viral dissemination to multiple brain regions, including the amygdala and hippocampus. Behavioral assays show a significant increase in anxiety- and depression-like behaviors 14 days following viral infection. Moreover, we observed microglia activation following SARS2-N501YMA30 infection, along with an augmentation in microglia-dependent neuronal activity in the amygdala. Pharmacological inhibition of microglial activity subsequent to viral spike inoculation mitigates microglia-dependent neuronal hyperactivity. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis of infected brains revealed the upregulation of inflammatory and cytokine-related pathways, implicating microglia-driven neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of neuronal hyperactivity and behavioral abnormality. Overall, these data provide critical insights into the neurological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection and underscore microglia as a potential therapeutic target for ameliorating virus-induced neurobehavioral abnormalities.",

    "abstract": "Algal blooms drive global biogeochemical cycles of key nutrients in the oceans and serve as hotspots for biological interactions. The massive spring blooms of the cosmopolitan coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi (E. huxleyi) are often infected by the lytic Emiliania huxleyi specific virus (EhV) which is a major mortality agent triggering bloom demise. Nonetheless, the multi-annual 'boom and bust' pattern of E. huxleyi suggests that mechanisms of coexistence are essential for these host-virus dynamics. To investigate host-virus coexistence, we developed a new model system from an E. huxleyi culture which recovered from viral infection. The recovered population coexists with the virus, as host cells continue to grow in parallel to viral production. By applying a single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) approach to quantify the fraction of infected cells and assessing infection-specific lipid biomarkers, we identified a small subpopulation (5-7% of cells) that was infected and produced new virions, whereas the majority of the host population could resist infection. To further assess population heterogeneity, we generated monoclonal strain collections using single-cell sorting and subsequently phenotyped their susceptibility to EhV infection. This unraveled a substantial cell-to-cell heterogeneity across a continuum of susceptibility to resistance, suggesting that infection outcomes may vary depending on the individual cell. These results add a new dimension to our understanding of the complexity of host-virus interactions that are commonly assessed in bulk and described by binary definitions of resistance or susceptibility. We propose that phenotypic heterogeneity drives E. huxleyi-EhV coexistence and may potentially provide the coexisting strain an ecological advantage by killing competing susceptible strains.",

    "abstract": "Spotted fever group Rickettsia obligately reside in the cytosol where they parasitize over fifty metabolites from their hosts. However, the role for metabolite acquisition in pathogenesis remains unclear. Here, we find that depletion of the abundant low molecular weight thiol glutathione led to an impaired ability of Rickettsia parkeri to form plaques. Super-resolution microscopy revealed that glutathione depletion with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) in endothelial or epithelial cells led to the formation of bacterial chains that increased in length over time. Chained bacteria had fewer actin-tails and were impeded for their ability to spread from cell to cell. Glutathione depletion also caused an increased frequency of colocalization between the bacterial surface and polyubiquitin. R. parkeri was significantly more restricted upon glutathione depletion in primary macrophages than in epithelial cells in a mechanism that avoided activating the inflammasome and the production of type I interferon. Together, these data suggest that host glutathione is critical for rickettsial septation, actin-based motility, avoiding ubiquitylation, and survival in immune cells.",

    "abstract": "H9N2 avian influenza viruses pose a global threat to animal and human health. While vaccination is essential for mitigating disease impact, these viruses evolve to evade vaccine immunity through changes in the haemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein. In this study, we identified immune escape mutation in an H9N2 virus resulting from pressure exerted by homologous chicken antisera. The immune-escape variant acquired an amino acid substitution, replacing glycine (G) with glutamic acid (E) at position 149 in the HA protein. The G149E mutant virus lost the ability to agglutinate chicken erythrocytes, while still maintaining replication comparable to the wild-type virus in chicken embryos and cells. This led to the hypothesis that the G149E substitution, leading to a shift from a neutral to a negative charge polarity at HA position 149, might be crucial for the optimal interaction between the virus and receptors on erythrocytes. Investigation indicated that agglutination could be restored by substituting E to positively charged amino acids histidine (H), arginine (R) or lysine (K). These findings suggest that the H9N2 virus may be likely acquire the G149E mutation under immune pressure in nature. This mutation poses challenges to vaccination and surveillance efforts as it partially evades immune protection and is not easily detectable by conventional haemagglutination assays. This underscores the intricate interplay between antigenic variation and viral traits, emphasising the critical need for ongoing surveillance and research to effectively mitigate the risks associated with avian influenza H9N2 viruses.",

    "abstract": "Acinetobacter baumannii is associated with multidrug resistant (MDR) infections in healthcare settings, with fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin being currently ineffective. Clinical isolates largely harbor mutations in the GyrA and TopoIV fluoroquinolone targets, as well as mutations that increase expression of drug resistance-nodulation-division (RND) efflux pumps. Factors critical for maintaining fitness levels of pump overproducers are uncharacterized despite their prevalence in clinical isolates, so proteins that contribute to fitness of FQR strains overexpressing three known RND systems were identified using high-density insertion mutagenesis. Overproduction of the AdeFGH efflux pump caused hypersensitization to defects in outer membrane homeostatic regulation, including lesions that reduced peptidoglycan recycling and LOS biosynthesis, and interfered with outer membrane lipid asymmetry driven by the Mla system. In contrast, AdeAB pump overproduction, which does not affect the outer membrane pump component, was relatively tolerant to loss of these functions, consistent with outer membrane protein overproduction being the primary disruptive component. Surprisingly, overproduction of proton-transporting efflux pumps had little impact on cytosolic pH, consistent with a compensatory response to pump activity. The most striking transcriptional changes were associated with AdeFGH pump overproduction, resulting in activation of the phenylacetate (PAA) degradation regulon. Disruption of the PAA pathway resulted in cytosolic acidification and defective expression of genes involved in protection from peroxide stress. These results indicate that the RND outer membrane protein overproduction is compensated by cytoplasmic buffering and maintenance of outer membrane integrity in A. baumannii to facilitate fitness of FQR isolates.",

    "abstract": "Salmonella enterica is a globally disseminated pathogen that is the cause of over 100 million infections per year. The resulting diseases caused by S. enterica are dependent upon host susceptibility and the infecting serovar. For example, Typhoid fever is a human exclusive disease caused by S. enterica serovar Typhi. As S. enterica serovar Typhimurium induces a typhoid like disease in mice, this model has been used extensively to illuminate various aspects of Salmonella infection and host responses. However, the infection is so severe that even one infectious bacterium injected intravenously will cause mortality in 100% of animals within one week of infection. Due to this severity, researchers often use strains of mice resistant to infection or attenuated Salmonella strains to understand adaptive immunity and infection dynamics. Despite decades of research, many aspects of Salmonella infection and fundamental biology remain poorly understood. Here, we use a Transposon Insertion Sequencing (TIS) technique to interrogate the essential genomes of widely used isogenic wild-type and attenuated S. Typhimurium strains. We reveal differential essential pathways between strains, provide a direct link between iron starvation, DNA synthesis and bacterial membrane integrity, and show S. Typhi and S.

    "abstract": "Infections caused by multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae remain the leading cause of pneumonia-related deaths in children < 5 years globally, and mutations in penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 2x have been identified as the major cause of resistance in the organism to beta-lactams. Thus, the development of new modulators with enhanced binding of PBP2x is highly encouraged. In this study, phenolics, due to their reported antibacterial activities, were screened against the active site of PBP2x using structure-based pharmacophore and molecular docking techniques, and the ability of the top-hit phenolics to inhibit the active and allosteric sites of PBP2x was refined through 120 ns molecular dynamic simulation. Except for gallocatechin gallate and lysidicichin, respectively, at the active and allosteric sites of PBP2x, the top-hit phenolics had higher negative binding free energy ({Delta}Gbind) than amoxicillin [active site (-19.23 kcal/mol), allosteric site (-33.75 Kcal/mol)]. Although silicristin had the best broad-spectrum effects at the active (-38.41 kcal/mol) and allosteric (-50.54 kcal/mol) sites of PBP2x, the high thermodynamic entropy (4.90 [A]) of the resulting complex might suggest the need for its possible structural refinement for enhanced potency. Interestingly, silicristin had a predicted synthetic feasibility score of < 5 and quantum calculations using the DFT B3LYP/6-31G+ (dp) revealed that silicristin is less stable and more reactive than amoxicillin. These findings point to the possible benefits of the top-hit phenolics, and most especially silicristin, in the direct and synergistic treatment of infections caused by S. pneumoniae. Accordingly, silicristin is currently the subject of further confirmatory in vitro research.",

    "abstract": "Although depolymerization of complex carbohydrates is a growth-limiting bottleneck for microbial decomposers, we still lack understanding about how the production of different types of extracellular enzymes affect individual microbes and in turn the performance of whole decomposer communities. In this work we use a theoretical model to evaluate the potential trade-offs faced by microorganisms in biopolymer decomposition which arise due to the varied biochemistry of different depolymerizing enzyme classes. We specifically consider two broad classes of depolymerizing extracellular enzymes, which are widespread across microbial taxa: exo-enzymes that cleave small units from the ends of polymer chains and endo-enzymes that act at random positions generating degradation products of varied sizes. Our results demonstrate a fundamental trade-off in the production of these enzymes which can be explained by intrinsically different temporal depolymerization dynamics. As a consequence, specialists that produce either exo- or only endo-enzymes limit their growth to high or low substrate conditions, respectively. Conversely, generalists that produce both enzymes in an optimal ratio expand their niche and benefit from the synergy between the two enzymes. Finally, our results show that, in spatially-explicit environments, consortia composed of endo- and exo-specialists can only exist under oligotrophic conditions. In summary, our analysis demonstrates that the (evolutionary or ecological) selection of a depolymerization pathway will affect microbial fitness under low or high substrate conditions, with impacts on the ecological dynamics of microbial communities. It provides a possible explanation why many polysaccharide degraders in nature show the genetic potential to produce both of these enzyme classes.",

Several reports demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 S protein fusogenicity is reportedly closely associated with the intrinsic pathogenicity of the virus determined using hamster models. However, the association between S protein fusogenicity and other virological parameters remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the virological parameters of eleven previous variants of concern (VOCs) and variants of interest (VOIs) correlating with S protein fusogenicity. S protein fusogenicity was found to be strongly correlated with S1/S2 cleavage efficiency and plaque size formed by clinical isolates. However, S protein fusogenicity was less associated with pseudoviral infectivity, pseudovirus entry efficiency, and viral replication kinetics. Taken together, our results suggest that S1/S2 cleavage efficiency and plaque size could be potential indicators to predict the intrinsic pathogenicity of newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

    "abstract": "Neurons are challenged to maintain proteostasis in neuronal projections, particularly with the physiological stress at synapses to support intercellular communication underlying important functions such as memory and movement control. Proteostasis is maintained through regulated protein synthesis and degradation and chaperone-assisted protein folding. Using high-resolution fluorescent microscopy, we discovered that neurons localize a subset of chaperone mRNAs to their dendrites, particularly more proximal regions, and increase this asymmetric localization following proteotoxic stress through microtubule-based transport from the soma. The most abundant chaperone mRNA in dendrites encodes the constitutive heat shock protein 70, HSPA8. Proteotoxic stress in cultured neurons, induced by inhibiting proteasome activity or inducing oxidative stress, enhanced transport of Hspa8 mRNAs to dendrites and the percentage of mRNAs engaged in translation on mono and polyribosomes. Knocking down the ALS-related protein Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) and a dominant mutation in the heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 (HNRNPA2B1) impaired stress-mediated localization of Hspa8 mRNA to dendrites in cultured murine motor neurons and human iPSC-derived neurons, respectively, revealing the importance of these RNA-binding proteins in maintaining proteostasis. These results reveal the increased dendritic localization and translation of the constitutive HSP70 Hspa8 mRNA as a crucial neuronal stress response to uphold proteostasis and prevent neurodegeneration.",

This study is the first to demonstrate how the hypoxic increment of methylated histones cross-talks with other epigenetic changes, such as histone clipping, and heterochromatin redistribution (senescence-associated heterochromatin foci, SAHF) found during oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). Raf activation in primary human fibroblasts IMR90 increased cathepsin L (CTSL)-mediated clipping of histone 3 (H3), H2B and H4 at H3 A21/T22, H2B T19/K20, and H4 G11/K12, respectively. Hypoxia protected H3 from CTSL by increasing histone methylation, especially at H3K23me3 without reducing the activity of CTSL. The maintenance of methylated histones is sufficient for protecting histones from CTSL, not sufficient but necessary for inhibiting SAHFs. Expression of cleaved H3 induces senescence even under hypoxia, suggesting that hypoxia disrupts this positive feedback loop of OIS by increasing histone methylation. Thus, hypoxia protects histones and chromatin from dramatic epigenetic changes by increasing histone methylation.",

Impaired endothelial cell (EC) functions are thought to contribute in AKI to CKD transition, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we identify a critical role for endothelial oxygen sensing prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) enzymes 1-3 in regulating post-ischemic kidney repair. In renal endothelium, we observed compartment-specific differences in the expression of the three PHD isoforms in both mice and humans. We found that post-ischemic concurrent inactivation of endothelial PHD1, PHD2, and PHD3 but not PHD2 alone promoted maladaptive kidney repair characterized by exacerbated tissue injury, fibrosis, and inflammation. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of the post-ischemic endothelial PHD1, PHD2 and PHD3 deficient (PHDTiEC) kidney revealed an endothelial glycolytic transcriptional signature, also observed in human kidneys with severe AKI. This metabolic program was coupled to upregulation of the SLC16A3 gene encoding the lactate exporter monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4). Strikingly, treatment with the MCT4 inhibitor syrosingopine restored adaptive kidney repair in PHDTiEC mice. Mechanistically, MCT4 inhibition suppressed pro-inflammatory EC activation reducing monocyte-endothelial cell interaction. Our findings suggest avenues for halting AKI to CKD transition based on selectively targeting the endothelial hypoxia-driven glycolysis/MCT4 axis.",

Here we investigated whether pharmacological modulation of the BACH1 by hemin impacts on antioxidant responses and reparative angiogenesis in a mouse model of myocardial infarction (MI). Methods and results: In vitro studies on vascular cells showed hemin treatment downregulates BACH1 gene and protein expression and upregulates HMOX1. This axis was confirmed to be modulated in the murine infarcted heart, with BACH1 being upregulated, and HMOX1 downregulated compared to sham. Treatment with hemin every 3 days for 28 days post-MI significantly decreased BACH1 and increased HMOX1 protein expression, though no decrease in oxidative stress markers was detected. Hemin treated mice showed increases in both capillary and arteriole density, and reduced iron accumulation compared with controls. Furthermore, echocardiology measurements showed hemin treatment induced significant improvements in left ventricular wall thickness, and cardiac function as indicated by increased ejection fraction, fractional shortening, and stroke volume measurements. Conclusion: Hemin has therapeutic potential to improve revascularisation and cardiac function in the heart post-MI.",

Here, we investigate the role of Arabidopsis CROWDED NUCLEI lamin analogs during gametophyte and seed development. We observed defects in crwn mutant seeds, including seed abortion and reduced germination rate. Quadruple crwn null genotypes were rarely transmitted through gametophytes. We focused on the crwn1 crwn2 (crwn1/2) endosperm, which exhibited enlarged chalazal cysts and increased expression of stress-related genes and the MADS-box transcription factor PHERES1 and its targets. Previously, it was shown that PHERES1 is regulated by H3K27me3 and that CRWN1 interacts with the PRC2 interactor PWO1. Thus, we tested whether crwn1/2 alters H3K27me3 patterns. We observed a mild loss of H3K27me3 at several hundred loci, which differed between endosperm and leaves. These data indicate that CRWNs are necessary to maintain the H3K27me3 landscape, with tissue-specific chromatin and transcriptional consequences.",

    "abstract": "Mutations of MFSD7c (also known as Flvcr2), which is an orphan transporter, are linked to Fowler syndrome 1, 2. Here, we use Mfsd7c knockout mice and cell-based assays to reveal that MFSD7c is a choline transporter at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We performed comprehensive metabolomics and detected differential changes of metabolites in the brains and livers of Mfsd7c knockout (Mfsd7c-/-) embryos. Particularly, we found that choline-related metabolites were altered in the brains but not in the livers of Mfsd7c-/- embryos. Thus, we hypothesized that MFSD7c regulates the levels of choline in the brain. Indeed, expression of human MFSD7c in cells significantly increased choline uptake. Interestingly, we showed that choline uptake by MFSD7c is greatly increased by choline-metabolizing enzymes, leading us to demonstrate that MFSD7c is a facilitative transporter of choline. Furthermore, single-cell patch-clamp showed that the import of choline by MFSD7c is electrogenic. Choline transport function of MFSD7c is conserved in vertebrates, but not in yeasts. We show that human MFSD7c is a functional ortholog of HNM1, the yeast choline importer. Employing our transport assays, we showed that several missense mutations of human MFSD7c from Fowler patients had abolished or reduced choline transport activity. Mice lacking Mfsd7c in the CNS endothelial cells suppressed the import of exogenous choline from blood but unexpectedly had increased choline levels in the brain. Stable-isotope tracing study revealed that MFSD7c is required for exporting choline derived from lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) in the brain. Collectively, our work identifies MFSD7c as a choline transporter at the BBB. This study suggests that defective export of choline in the brain may be a cause of Fowler syndrome.",

Here, we describe the use of a mtDNA-damaging agent in tandem with CRISPR/Cas9 screening for the genome-wide discovery of factors essential for mtDNA damage response. Using mitochondria-targeted doxorubicin (mtDox) we generate mtDNA double-strand breaks (mtDSBs) specifically in this organelle. Combined with an untargeted Dox screen, we identify genes with significantly greater essentiality during mitochondrial versus nuclear DNA damage. We characterize the essentially of our top hit - WRNIP1 - observed here for the first time to respond to mtDNA damage.

    "abstract": "Transcription factors bind to DNA by recognizing specific bases within their binding motifs. Binding to each DNA mononucleotide within the motif often contributes independently to total binding energy. However, some transcription factors (TFs) can bind to DNA more specifically than predicted by this model, by directly recognizing DNA dinucleotides. To understand this process, we have solved the structures of the basic helix-loop-helix protein MYF5, and the homeodomain protein BARHL2 together with DNA containing a set of dinucleotides that have different affinities to the proteins at high resolution (< 1 Angstrom). We observe that dinucleotides can be recognized either enthalpically by an extensive water network that connects the adjacent bases to the TF, or entropically by formation of a hydrophobic patch that maintains water mobility at the protein-DNA interface. The two distinct thermodynamic signatures of the two equally optimal sites also confer differential temperature sensitivity to the optimal sites, with implications for thermal regulation of gene expression. Our results uncover the enigma of how TFs can recognize more complex local features than mononucleotides, and demonstrate that water-mediated recognition is important in predicting affinities of macromolecules from their sequence.",

    "abstract": "14-3-3{epsilon} is involved in various types of malignancies by increasing cell proliferation, promoting cell invasion or inhibiting apoptosis. In cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), 14-3-3{epsilon} is over expressed and mislocalized from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where it interacts with the cell division cycle 25 A (CDC25A) and suppresses apoptosis. Hence inhibition of the 14-3-3{epsilon} - CDC25A interaction is an attractive target for promoting apoptosis in cSCC. In this work, we optimized the structure of our previously designed inhibitor of 14-3-3{epsilon} - CDC25A interaction, pT, a phosphopeptide fragment corresponding to one of the two binding regions of CDC25A to 14-3-3{epsilon}. Starting from pT, we developed peptide analogs that bind 14-3-3{epsilon} with nanomolar affinities. Peptide analogs were designed by shortening the pT peptide, and introducing modifications at position 510 of the pT(502-510) analog. Both molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and biophysical methods were used to determine peptides binding to 14-3-3{epsilon}. Shortening the pT peptide from 14 to 9 amino acid residues resulted in a peptide (pT(502-510)) that binds 14-3-3{epsilon} with a KD value of 45.2 nM. Gly to Phe substitution in position 510 of pT(502-510) led to further improvement in affinity (KD: 22.0 nM) of the peptide for 14-3-3{epsilon}. Our results suggest that the designed peptide analogs are potential candidates for inhibiting 14-3-3{epsilon} - CDC25A interactions in cSCC cells; thus, inducing their apoptosis.",

Previously, based on the unique features of the structure of OSCA1.2, we postulated the potential involvement of several structural elements in sensing membrane tension1. Interestingly, while OSCA1, 2, and 3 clades are activated by membrane stretch in cell-attached patches (i.e., they are stretch-activated channels), they differ in their ability to transduce membrane deformation induced by a blunt probe (poking). In an effort to understand the domains contributing to mechanical signal transduction, we used cryo-electron microscopy to solve the structure of Arabidopsis thaliana (At) OSCA3.1, which, unlike AtOSCA1.2, only produced stretch- but not poke-activated currents in our initial characterization2. Mutagenesis and electrophysiological assessment of conserved and divergent putative mechanosensitive features of OSCA1.2 reveal a selective disruption of the macroscopic currents elicited by poking without considerable effects on stretch-activated currents (SAC). Our results support the involvement of the amphipathic helix and lipid-interacting residues in the membrane fenestration in the response to poking.

    "abstract": "The cholesterol affinities of many integral plasma membrane proteins have been estimated by molecular simulation techniques. However, these values lack experimental confirmation. We therefore developed a simple mathematical model to extract sterol binding constants and stoichiometries from published isotherms for the dependence of the activity of such proteins on membrane cholesterol concentration. The model assumes competition for cholesterol between the proteins and the phospholipids. This competition makes the binding isotherms of the proteins sigmoidal with strongly-lagged thresholds. Using sterol affinities and stoichiometries for the phospholipids taken from the literature, we matched computed isotherms to experimental curves. Three oligomeric transporters were found to bind cholesterol without cooperativity with association constants of 35 for Kir3.4* and 100 for both Kir2 and a GAT transporter. (The corresponding {Delta}G{degrees} values are -8.8, -11.4 and -11.4 KJ/mol, respectively.) These association constants are significantly lower than those for the phospholipids, which range from ~100 to 6,000. The BK channel, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and the M192I mutant of Kir3.4* appear to bind multiple cholesterol molecules strongly and cooperatively with subunit affinities of 563, 950 and 700, respectively. The model predicts that the three less avid transporters are approximately half-saturated in their native plasma membranes; hence, sensitive to variations in cholesterol in vivo. The more avid proteins would be nearly saturated in vivo. The method can be applied to any integral protein or other ligand in any bilayer of phospholipids for which reasonable estimates of sterol affinities and stoichiometries can be assigned.",

Structure-based data mining failed to identify any Orf63 homolog beyond the family of temperate bacteriophages.

    "abstract": "Epigenetic regulation orchestrates mammalian transcription, but functional links between them remain elusive. To tackle this problem, we here use epigenomic and transcriptomic data from 13 ENCODE cell types to train machine learning models to predict gene expression from histone post-translational modifications (PTMs), achieving transcriptome-wide correlations of ~0.70-0.79 for most samples. In addition to recapitulating known associations between histone PTMs and expression patterns, our models predict that acetylation of histone subunit H3 lysine residue 27 (H3K27ac) near the transcription start site (TSS) significantly increases expression levels. To validate this prediction experimentally and investigate how engineered vs. natural deposition of H3K27ac might differentially affect expression, we apply the synthetic dCas9-p300 histone acetyltransferase system to 8 genes in the HEK293T cell line. Further, to facilitate model building, we perform MNase-seq to map genome-wide nucleosome occupancy levels in HEK293T. We observe that our models perform well in accurately ranking relative fold changes among genes in response to the dCas9-p300 system; however, their ability to rank fold changes within individual genes is noticeably diminished compared to predicting expression across cell types from their native epigenetic signatures. Our findings highlight the need for more comprehensive genome-scale epigenome editing datasets, better understanding of the actual modifications made by epigenome editing tools, and improved causal models that transfer better from endogenous cellular measurements to perturbation experiments. Together these improvements would facilitate the ability to understand and predictably control the dynamic human epigenome with consequences for human health.",

    "abstract": "The metabolic engineering of microbes has broad applications, including in biomanufacturing, bioprocessing, and environmental remediation. The introduction of a complex, multi-step pathway often imposes a substantial metabolic burden on the host cell, restraining the accumulation of productive biomass and limiting pathway efficiency. One strategy to alleviate metabolic burden is division of labor (DOL), in which different subpopulations carry out different parts of the pathway and work together to convert a substrate into a final product. However, the maintenance of different engineered subpopulations is challenging due to competition and convoluted inter-strain population dynamics. Through modeling, we show that dynamic division of labor (DDOL) mediated by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) can overcome these limitations and enable the robust maintenance of burdensome, multi-step pathways. We also use plasmid genomics to uncover evidence that DDOL is a strategy utilized by natural microbial communities. Our work suggests that bioengineers can harness HGT to stabilize synthetic metabolic pathways in microbial communities, enabling the development of robust engineered systems for deployment in a variety of contexts.",

    "abstract": "De novo genes emerge from non-coding regions of genomes via succession of mutations. Among others, such mutations activate transcription and create a new open reading frame (ORF). Although the mechanisms underlying ORFs emergence are well documented, relatively little is known about the mechanisms enabling new transcription events. Yet, in many species a continuum between absent and very prominent transcription has been reported for essentially all regions of the genome. In this study we searched for de novo transcripts by using newly assembled genomes and transcriptomes of seven inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster, originating from six European and one African population. This setup allowed us to detect line specific de novo transcripts, and compare them to their homologous non-transcribed regions in other lines, as well as genic and intergenic control sequences. We studied the association with transposable elements and the enrichment of transcription factor motifs upstream of de novo emerged transcripts and compared them with regulatory elements. We found that de novo transcripts overlap with TEs more often than expected by chance. The emergence of new transcripts correlates with high CpG islands and regions of TEs activity. Moreover, upstream regions of de novo transcripts are highly enriched with regulatory motifs. Such motifs abound in new transcripts overlapping with TEs, particularly DNA TEs, and are more conserved upstream de novo transcripts than upstream their non-transcribed homologs. Overall, our study demonstrates that TEs insertion is important for transcript emergence, partly by introducing new regulatory motifs from DNA TE families.",

In order to analyze this computationally intractable stochastic multidimensional system, we introduce a pair approximation, which allows us to reduce the spine dynamics into a lower dimensional manageable system of closed equations. It is found that the rates of information gain and energy attain their maximal values during an initial period of LTP (i.e. during stimulation), and after that they recover to their baseline low values, as opposed to a memory trace that lasts much longer. This suggests that learning phase is much more energy demanding than the memory phase. We show that positive correlations between neighboring spines increase both a duration of memory trace and energy cost during LTP, but the memory time per invested energy increases dramatically for very strong positive synaptic cooperativity, suggesting a beneficial role of synaptic clustering on memory duration. In contrast, information gain after LTP is the largest for negative correlations, and energy efficiency of that information generally declines with increasing synaptic cooperativity. We also find that dendritic spines can use sparse representations for encoding of long-term information, as both energetic and structural efficiencies of retained information and its lifetime exhibit maxima for low fractions of stimulated synapses during LTP. Moreover, we find that such efficiencies drop significantly with increasing the number of spines. In general, our stochastic thermodynamics approach provides a unifying framework for studying, from first principles, information encoding and its energy cost during learning and memory in stochastic systems of interacting synapses.",

    "abstract": "Brain water homeostasis provides not only physical protection, but also determines the diffusion of chemical molecules key for information processing and metabolic stability. As a major type of glial cell in the brain parenchyma, astrocytes are the dominant cell type expressing aquaporin water channels. However, how astrocyte aquaporin contributes to brain water homeostasis remains to be understood. We report here that astrocyte aquaporin 4 (AQP4) mediates a tonic water efflux in basal conditions. Acute inhibition of astrocyte AQP4 leads to intracellular water accumulation as optically resolved by fluorescence-translated imaging in acute brain slices, and in vivo by fiberphotometry in moving mice. We then show that the tonic aquaporin water efflux maintains astrocyte volume equilibrium, astrocyte and neuron Ca2+ signaling, and extracellular space remodeling during optogenetically induced cortical spreading depression. Using diffusion- weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), we observed that in vivo inhibition of AQP4 water efflux heterogeneously disturbs brain water homeostasis in a region-dependent manner. Our data suggest that astrocyte aquaporin, though bidirectional in nature, mediates a tonic water outflow to sustain cellular and environmental equilibrium in brain parenchyma.",

    "abstract": "Proteins and polypeptides containing extended backbone monomers embody highly desirable structures and functions, but they cannot yet be biosynthesized in cells. There are two challenges at work. First is the ribosome, whose ability to promote rapid bond-forming reactions to and from anything other than an -amino acid or -hydroxy acid is unknown. The second challenge is the absence of orthogonal enzymes that acylate tRNA with extended backbone monomers. Here we describe a general approach to the programmed cellular synthesis of proteins containing extended backbone monomers that circumvents both of these challenges. Rather than relying on direct and uncharacterized reactions of non--amino acid monomers within the ribosomal PTC, we develop a proximity-guided intramolecular rearrangement that effectively edits the protein backbone post-translationally. The method relies on the ability of PylRS-like aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase enzymes to accept diverse -hydroxy acid monomers, including those whose side chains contain masked nucleophiles. Introduction of such an -hydroxy acid monomer into a protein translated in vivo, followed by nucleophile unmasking, sets up a thermodynamically favored and quantitative intramolecular Backbone Extension Acyl Rearrangement (BEAR) reaction that edits the protein backbone to install an extended backbone monomer. In the examples described here, the intramolecular rearrangement converts an -peptide backbone directly into a {beta}-backbone. As far as we know, this report represents the first example in which a much-desired expanded backbone {beta}-amino acid linkage has been introduced site selectively into a protein in a cell.",

    "abstract": "Introduction. Men reportedly experience more severe disease and adverse outcomes from COVID-19, including death. Women report more adverse events (AEs) after vaccination in general. While few studies have addressed sex-specific risk factors or molecular mechanisms behind COVID-19, none have examined sex differences in the response to COVID-19 vaccination. Methods. We searched AE reporting databases to find sex differences specific to COVID-19 vaccines. We analyzed public datasets to identify baseline sex differences in gene expression across cell types and time points, and sex differences in the response to the second BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine dose. Results. Sex differences in AE rates for mRNA vaccines equaled those for other non-mRNA vaccines. T cells and monocytes showed the greatest number of sexually dimorphic genes. Platelet counts in the study population differed significantly before vaccination (3.6% in females vs 1.8% in males) but not after the second BNT162b2 dose (7.2% vs 7.3%). There were no notable sex differences in the expression of key genes induced by the second dose after exclusion of platelets. BNT162b2 dose 2-specific APOBEC3Ahigh monocytes and the dose 2-induced gene signature persisted for longer in women. Glucocorticoid-responsive TSC22D3, CEBPB/D and DDIT4 were specifically induced in females; the voltage-gated potassium channel regulatory subunit KCNE3 was specifically induced in males. Conclusions. This sexual dimorphism in both X-linked and autosomal gene transcriptome in PBMCs after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination might explain fatigue, autoimmune, and neurological AEs reported after vaccination at different rates in women and men.",

    "abstract": "Chronic stress can change how we learn and, thus, how we make decisions by promoting the formation of inflexible, potentially maladaptive, habits. Here we investigated the neuronal circuit mechanisms that enable this. Using a multifaceted approach in male and female mice, we reveal a dual pathway, amygdala-striatal, neuronal circuit architecture by which a recent history of chronic stress shapes learning to disrupt flexible goal-directed behavior in favor of inflexible habits. Chronic stress inhibits activity of basolateral amygdala projections to the dorsomedial striatum to impede the action-outcome learning that supports flexible, goal-directed decisions. Stress also increases activity in direct central amygdala projections to the dorsomedial striatum to promote the formation of rigid, inflexible habits. Thus, stress exerts opposing effects on two amygdala-striatal pathways to promote premature habit formation. These data provide neuronal circuit insights into how chronic stress shapes learning and decision making, and help understand how stress can lead to the disrupted decision making and pathological habits that characterize substance use disorders and other psychiatric conditions.",

    "abstract": "Cyclic AMP controls neuronal ion channel activity. For example hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) and M-type K+ channels are activated by cAMP. These effects have been suggested to be involved in astrocyte control of neuronal activity, for example, by controlling the action potential firing frequency. In cortical neurons, cAMP can induced mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs) consisting of small-amplitude, subthreshold oscillations separating complete action potentials, which lowers the firing frequency greatly. We extend a model of neuronal activity by including HCN and M channels, and show that it can reproduce a series of experimental results under various conditions involving and inferring with cAMP-induced activation of HCN and M channels. In particular, we find that the model can exhibit MMOs as found experimentally, and argue that both HCN and M channels are crucial for reproducing these patterns. To understand how M and HCN channels contribute to produce MMOs, we exploit the fact that the model is a multiple-time scale dynamical system. We show that the MMO mechanism does not rely on the very slow dynamics of HCN and M channel gating variables, since the model is able to produce MMOs even when HCN and M channel activity is kept  constant. In other words, the cAMP-induced increase in the average activity of HCN and M channels allows MMOs to be produced by the fast subsystem alone. We show that the fast-subsystem MMOs are due to a folded node singularity, a geometrical structure well known to be involved in the generation of MMOs in slow-fast systems. Besides raising new mathematical questions for multiple-timescale systems, our work is a starting point for future research on how cAMP signalling, for example resulting from interactions between neurons and glial cells, affects neuronal activity via HCN and M channels.",

Supporting cognitive functions, the caudate receives projections from cortical association regions. Building on recent insights about the details of how multiple cortical networks are specialized for distinct aspects of higher-order cognition, we revisited caudate organization using within-individual precision neuroimaging (n=2, each participant scanned 31 times). Detailed analysis revealed that the caudate has side-by-side zones that are coupled to at least five distinct distributed association networks, paralleling the specialization observed in the cerebral cortex. Examining correlation maps from closely juxtaposed seed regions in the caudate recapitulated the five distinct cerebral networks including their multiple spatially distributed regions. These results extend the general notion of parallel specialized basal ganglia circuits, with the additional discovery that even within the caudate, there is fine-grained separation of multiple distinct higher-order networks.",

    "abstract": "The default mode network (DMN) typically deactivates to external tasks, yet supports semantic cognition. It comprises medial temporal (MT), core, and fronto-temporal (FT) subsystems, but its functional organisation is unclear: the requirement for perceptual coupling versus decoupling, input modality (visual/verbal), type of information (social/spatial) and control demands all potentially affect its recruitment. We examined the effect of these factors on activation and deactivation of DMN subsystems during semantic cognition, across four task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets, and localised these responses in whole-brain state space defined by gradients of intrinsic connectivity. FT showed activation consistent with a central role across domains, tasks and modalities, although it was most responsive to abstract, verbal tasks; this subsystem uniquely showed more 'tuned' states characterised by increases in both activation and deactivation when semantic retrieval demands were higher. MT also activated to both perceptually-coupled (scenes) and decoupled (autobiographical memory) tasks, and showed stronger responses to picture associations, consistent with a role in scene construction. Core DMN consistently showed deactivation, especially to externally-oriented tasks. These diverse contributions of DMN subsystems to semantic cognition were related to their location on intrinsic connectivity gradients: activation was closer to sensory-motor cortex than deactivation, particularly for FT and MT, while activation for core DMN was distant from both visual cortex and cognitive control. These results reveal distinctive yet complementary DMN responses: MT and FT support different memory-based representations that are accessed externally and internally, while deactivation in core DMN is associated with demanding, external semantic tasks.",

To determine the direct role of kinase signaling within the nucleus accumbens, specifically mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (ERK2), in mood- and drug-related behavior, we used a herpes-simplex virus to up- or down-regulate ERK2 in adult male rats. We then exposed rats to a battery of behavioral tasks including the elevated plus-maze, open field test, forced-swim test, conditioned place preference, and finally cocaine self-administration. Herein, we show that viral overexpression or knockdown of ERK2 in the nucleus accumbens induces distinct behavioral phenotypes. Specifically, over expression of ERK2 facilitated depression- and anxiety-like behavior while also increasing sensitivity to cocaine. Conversely, down-regulation of ERK2 attenuated behavioral deficits, while blunting sensitivity to cocaine. Taken together, these data implicate ERK2 signaling, within the nucleus accumbens, in the regulation of affective behaviors and modulating sensitivity to the rewarding properties of cocaine",
