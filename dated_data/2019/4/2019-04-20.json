    "abstract": "Adaptations can be thought of as evolutionary technologies which allow an organism to exploit environments. Among convergent taxa, adaptations may be largely equivalent with the taxa operating in a similar set of environmental conditions, divergent with the taxa operating in different sets of environmental conditions, or superior with one taxon operating within an extended range of environmental conditions than the other. With this framework in mind, we sought to characterize the adaptations of two convergent nectarivorous bird families, the New World hummingbirds (Trochilidae) and Old World sunbirds (Nectariniidae), by comparing their biogeography. Looking at their elevational and latitudinal gradients, hummingbirds not only extend into but also maintain species richness in more extreme environments. We suspect that hummingbirds have a superior key adaptation that sunbirds lack, namely a musculoskeletal architecture that allows for hovering. Through biogeographic comparisons, we have been able to assess and understand adaptations as evolutionary technologies among two convergent bird families, a process that should work for most taxa.",

    "abstract": "Selection on behavioural traits holds a prominent role in the domestication of animals, with reductions in fear behaviour considered to be a key component. Specifically, there is a general assumption that domesticated species express reduced fear and reactivity towards novel stimuli compared to their ancestral species. However, very few studies have explicitly tested this proposed link between domestication and reduced fear responses. Of the limited number of studies experimentally addressing the alterations of fear during domestication, the majority have been done on canids. Previous work in foxes, wolves and dogs has led to the suggestion that decreased expression of fear in domesticated animals is linked to a domestication driven delay in the first onset of fearful behaviour during early ontogeny. Thus, wolves are expected to express exaggerated fearfulness earlier during ontogeny compared to dogs. However, while adult dogs are less fearful towards novelty than adult wolves and wolf-dog hybrids, consensus is lacking on when differences in fear expression arise in wolves and dogs. Here we present the first extended examination of fear development in hand-raised dogs and European grey wolves, using repeated novel object tests from six to 26 weeks of age. Contrary to expectations, we found no evidence in support of an increase in fearfulness in wolves with age or a delayed onset of fear response in dogs compared to wolves. Instead, we found that dogs strongly reduced their fear response in the period between six and 26 weeks of age, resulting in a significant species difference in fear expression towards novelty at 26 weeks. Critically, as wolves did not differ in their fear response towards novelty over time, the detected species difference was caused solely by a progressive reduced fear response in dogs. Our results thereby suggest that species differences in fear of novelty between wolves and dogs are not caused by a domestication driven shift in the first onset of fear response. Instead, we suggest that a loss of sensitivity towards novelty with age in dogs causes the difference in fear expression towards novelty in wolves and dogs.",

    "abstract": "Our study investigates the possible drivers of recombination hotspots in Theobroma cacao using ten genetically differentiated populations. By comparing recombination patterns between multiple populations, we obtain a novel view of recombination at the population-divergence timescale. For each population, a fine-scale recombination map was generated using the coalescent with a standard method based on linkage disequilibrium (LD). These maps revealed higher recombination rates in a domesticated population and a population that has undergone a recent bottleneck. We inferred hotspots of recombination for each population and find that the genomic locations of hotspots correlate with genetic differentiation between populations (FST). We used randomization approaches to generate appropriate null models to understand the association between hotspots of recombination and both DNA sequence motifs and genomic features. We found that hotspot regions contained fewer known retroelement sequences than expected and were overrepresented near transcription start and termination sites. Our findings indicate that recombination hotspots are evolving in a way that is consistent with genetic differentiation but are also preferentially driven to near coding regions. We illustrate that, consistent with predictions in plant domestication, the recombination rate of the domesticated population is orders of magnitude higher than that of other populations. More importantly, we find two fixed mutations in the domesticated populations FIGL1 protein. FIGL1 has been shown to increase recombination rates in Arabidopsis by several orders of magnitude, suggesting a possible mechanism for the observed increased recombination rate in the domesticated population.",

    "abstract": "With seemingly little effort, humans can both identify an object across large changes in orientation and extend category membership to novel exemplars. Although researchers argue that object shape is crucial in these cases, there are open questions as to how shape is represented for object recognition. Here we tested whether the human visual system incorporates a three-dimensional skeletal descriptor of shape to determine an objects identity. Skeletal models not only provide a compact description of an objects global shape structure, but also provide a quantitative metric by which to compare the visual similarity between shapes. Our results showed that a model of skeletal similarity explained the greatest amount of variance in participants object dissimilarity judgments when compared with other computational models of visual similarity (Experiment 1). Moreover, parametric changes to an objects skeleton led to proportional changes in perceived similarity, even when controlling for another model of structure (Experiment 2). Importantly, participants preferentially categorized objects by their skeletons across changes to local shape contours and non-accidental properties (Experiment 3). Our findings highlight the importance of skeletal structure in vision, not only as a shape descriptor, but also as a diagnostic cue of object identity.",

    "abstract": "Faithful segregation of homologous chromosomes at meiosis requires pairing and recombination. In taxa with dimorphic sex chromosomes, pairing between them in the heterogametic sex is limited to a narrow interval of residual sequence homology known as the pseudoautosomal region (PAR). Failure to form the obligate crossover in the PAR is associated with male infertility in house mice (Mus musculus) and humans. Yet despite this apparent functional constraint, the boundary and organization of the PAR is highly variable in mammals, and even between subspecies of mice. Here we estimate the genetic map in a previously-documented expansion of the PAR in the Mus musculus castaneus subspecies and show that the local recombination rate is 100-fold higher than the autosomal background. We identify an independent shift in the PAR boundary in the Mus musculus musculus subspecies and show that it involves a complex rearrangement but still recombines in heterozygous males. Finally, we demonstrate pervasive copy-number variation at the PAR boundary in wild populations of M. m. domesticus, M. m. musculus and M. m. castaneus. Our results suggest that the intensity of recombination activity in the PAR, coupled with relatively weak constraints on its sequence, permit the generation and maintenance in the population of unusual levels of polymorphism of unknown functional significance.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundR-loop is a nucleic acid structure containing an RNA-DNA hybrid and a displaced single-stranded DNA. Recently, accumulated evidence showed that R-loops widely present in various organisms genomes and are involved in many physiological processes, including DNA replication, RNA transcription, and DNA repair. RNase H-like superfamily (RNHLS) domain-containing proteins, such as RNase H enzymes, are essential in restricting R-loop levels. However, little is known about the function and relationship of other RNHLS proteins on R-loop regulation, especially in plants.\n\nResultsIn this study, we characterized 6193 RNHLS proteins from 13 representative plant species and clustered these proteins into 27 clusters, among which reverse transcriptases and exonucleases are the two largest groups. Moreover, we found 691 RNHLS proteins in Arabidopsis with a conserved catalytic alpha-helix and beta-sheet motif. Interestingly, each of the Arabidopsis RNHLS proteins is composed of not only an RNHLS domain but also another different protein domain. Additionally, the RNHLS genes are highly expressed in different meristems and metabolic tissues, which indicate that the RNHLS proteins might play important roles in the development and maintenance of these tissues.\n\nConclusionsIn summary, we systematically analyzed RNHL proteins in plants and found that there are mainly 27 subclusters of them. Most of these proteins might be implicated in DNA replication, RNA transcription, and nucleic acid degradation. We classified and characterized the RNHLS proteins in plants, which may afford new insights into the investigation of novel regulatory mechanisms and functions of R-loops.",

    "abstract": "Electrophysiological analysis has reveals much about the broad coding and neural ensemble dynamics that characterize gustatory cortical (GC) taste processing in awake rats, and about how these dynamics relate to behavior. With regard to mice, meanwhile, data concerning cortical taste coding have largely been restricted to imaging--a technique that reveals average levels of neural responsiveness, but that (currently) lacks the temporal sensitivity necessary for evaluation of fast response dynamics; furthermore, the few extant studies have thus far failed to provide consensus on basic features of coding. We have recorded the spiking activity of ensembles of GC neurons while presenting representatives of the basic taste modalities (sweet, salty, sour and bitter) to awake mice. Our first central result is the identification of similarities between rat and mouse taste processing: most mouse GC neurons (~66%) responded distinctly to multiple (3-4) tastes; temporal coding analyses further reveal, for the first time, that single mouse GC neurons sequentially code taste identity and palatability--the latter responses emerging ~0.5s after the former--with whole GC ensembles transitioning suddenly and coherently from coding taste identity to coding taste palatability. The second finding is that spatial location plays very little role in any aspect of taste responses--neither between- (anterior-posterior) nor within-mouse (dorsal-ventral) mapping revealed anatomical regions with narrow or temporally simple taste responses. These data confirm recent results showing that mouse cortical taste responses are not \\\"gustatopic,\\\" but also go beyond these imaging results to show that mice process tastes through time.",

    "abstract": "There is still a significant gap between our understanding of neural circuits and the behaviours they compute - i.e. the computations performed by these neural networks (Carandini 2012). Learning, behaviour, and memory formation, what used to only be associated with animals with neural systems, have been observed in many unicellular aneural species, namely Physarum, Paramecium, and Stentor (Tang & Marshall 2018). As these are fully functioning organisms, yet being unicellular, there is a much better chance to elucidate the detailed mechanisms underlying these learning processes in these organisms without the complications of highly interconnected neural circuits. An intriguing learning behaviour observed in Stentor roeselii (Jennings 1902) when stimulated with carmine has left scientists puzzled for more than a century. So far, none of the existing learning paradigm can fully encapsulate this particular series of five characteristic avoidant reactions. Although we were able to observe all responses described in literature and in a previous study (Dexter et al. 2019, manuscript in preparation), they do not conform to any particular learning model. We then investigated whether models based on machine learning approaches, including decision tree, random forest, and feed-forward neural networks could infer and predict the behavior of S. roeselii. Our results showed that an artificial neural network with multiple  computational neurons is inefficient at modelling the single-celled ciliates avoidant reactions. This has highlighted the complexity of behaviours in aneural organisms. Additionally, this report will also discuss the significance of elucidating molecular details underlying learning and decision-making processes in these unicellular organisms, which could offer valuable insights that are applicable to higher animals.",

Here, we study the role of tissue-intrinsic regenerative inflammatory signaling in stem cell mitosis of the adult Drosophila midgut at the baseline and the infected state and its impact on intestinal host defense to infection and stem cell-mediated dysplasia. Through a quantitative genetics screen we find that stem cell mitosis is positively linked with the expression of eiger, Delta, upd3 and vein in the midgut, as well as with dysplasia and host defense, but negatively with enterocyte endoreplication. We provide evidence that intertwined trade-offs fine-tune midgut homeostasis, according to which stem cell mitosis through cyclin E in stem cells promotes the optimal host defense to infection, unless dysplasia ensues. However, cyclin E in enteroblasts promotes enterocyte endoreplication and counterbalances stem cell mitosis and dysplasia, providing an alternative but less efficient mechanism to support host defense.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial promoters are usually formed by multiple cis-regulatory elements recognized by a plethora of transcriptional factors (TFs). From those, global regulators are key elements since these TFs are responsible for the regulation of hundreds of genes in the bacterial genome. For instance, Fis and IHF are two global regulators which play a major role in gene expression control in Escherichia coli and usually multiple cis-regulatory elements for these proteins co-occur at target promoters. Here, we investigated the relationship between the architecture of the cis-regulatory elements for Fis and IHF in E. coli. For this, we constructed 42 synthetic promoter variants harboring consensus cis-elements for Fis and IHF at different distances from a core -35/-10 region and in different numbers and combinations. We first demonstrated that although Fis preferentially recognizes its consensus cis-element, it can also recognize, to some extent, the consensus binding site for IHF, and the same was true for IHF, which was also able of recognizing Fis binding sites. However, changing the arrangement of the cis-elements (i.e., the position or the number of sites) can completely abolish unspecific binding of both TFs. More remarkably, we demonstrate that combining cis-elements for both TFs could result in Fis and IHF repressed or activated promoters depending on the final architecture of the promoters in an unpredictable way. Taken together, the data presented here demonstrate how small changes in the architecture of bacterial promoters could result in drastic changes in the final regulatory logic of the system, with important implications for the understanding of natural complex promoters in bacteria and their engineering for novel applications.\\n\\nImportanceThe understanding of the regulatory complex in bacteria is a key issue in modern microbiology. Here, we constructed synthetic bacterial promoters in order to investigate how binding of transcriptional factors to multiple target sites at the promoters can influence gene expression. Our results demonstrate in a systematic way that the arrangement and number of these cis-regulatory elements are crucial for the final expression dynamics of the target promoters. In particular, we show that TF binding specificity or promiscuity can be modulated using different promoter architectures based on consensus cis-regulatory elements, and that transcriptional repression and activation can also be affected by promoter architecture. These results are relevant both for the understanding of natural systems and for the construction of synthetic circuits for biotechnological applications.",

    "abstract": "The three nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) family members synthesize the electron carrier nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and are essential for cellular metabolism. In mammalian axons, NMNAT activity appears to be required for axon survival and is predominantly provided by NMNAT2. NMNAT2 has recently been shown to also function as a chaperone to aid in the refolding of misfolded proteins. Nmnat2 deficiency in mice, or in its ortholog dNmnat in Drosophila, results in axon outgrowth and survival defects. Peripheral nerve axons in NMNAT2-deficient mice fail to extend and innervate targets, and skeletal muscle is severely underdeveloped. In addition, removing NMNAT2 from established axons initiates axon death by Wallerian degeneration. We report here on two stillborn siblings with fetal akinesia deformation sequence (FADS), severely reduced skeletal muscle mass and hydrops fetalis. Clinical exome sequencing identified compound heterozygous NMNAT2 variant alleles in both cases. Both protein variants are incapable of supporting axon survival in mouse primary neuron cultures when overexpressed. In vitro assays demonstrate altered protein stability and/or defects in NAD+ synthesis and chaperone functions. Thus, both patient NMNAT2 alleles are null or severely hypo-morphic. These data indicate a previously unknown role for NMNAT2 in human neurological development and provide the first direct molecular evidence to support the involvement of Wallerian degeneration in a human axonal disorder.",

    "abstract": "Activator protein 1 (AP-1) is one of the largest families of basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors in eukaryotic cells. How AP-1 proteins achieve target DNA binding specificity remains elusive. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the AP-1-like protein (Yap) family comprises eight members (Yap1 to Yap8) that display distinct genomic target sites despite high sequence homology of their DNA binding bZIP domains. In contrast to the other members of the Yap family, which preferentially bind to short (7-8 bp) DNA motifs, Yap8 binds to an unusually long DNA motif (13 bp). It has been unclear what determines this unique specificity of Yap8. In this work, we use molecular and biochemical analysis combined with computer-based structural design and molecular dynamics simulations of Yap8-DNA interactions to better understand the structural basis of DNA binding specificity determinants. We identify specific residues in the N-terminal tail preceding the basic region, which define stable association of Yap8 with the ACR3 promoter. We propose that the N-terminal tail directly interacts with DNA and stabilizes Yap8 binding to the 13 bp motif. Thus, beside the core basic region, the adjacent N-terminal region contributes to alternative DNA binding selectivity within the AP-1 family.",

    "abstract": "Advances in synthetic biology, bioengineering, and computation allow us to rapidly and reliably program cells with increasingly complex and useful functions. However, because the functions we engineer cells to perform are typically unnecessary for cellular survival and burdensome to cell growth, they can be rapidly lost due to the processes of mutation and natural selection. To improve the evolutionary stability of engineered functions in a general manner, we developed an integrase-recombination-based differentiation gene circuit in Escherichia coli. In this system, differentiated cells uniquely carry out burdensome or toxic engineered functions but have limited capacity to grow (terminal differentiation), preventing the propagation of selectively advantageous loss of function mutations that inevitably arise. To experimentally implement terminal differentiation, we co-opted the R6K plasmid system, using differentiation to simultaneously activate T7 RNAP-driven expression of arbitrary engineered functions, and inactivate expression of {pi} protein (an essential factor for R6K plasmid replication), thereby allowing limitation of differentiated cell growth through antibiotic selection. We experimentally demonstrate terminal differentiation increases both duration and magnitude of high-burden T7 RNAP-driven expression, and that its evolutionary stability can be further improved with strategic redundancy. Using burdensome overexpression of a fluorescent protein as a model engineered function, our terminal differentiation circuit results in a ~2.8-fold (single-cassette) and ~4.2-fold (two-cassette) increase of total fluorescent protein produced compared to high-burden naive expression in which all cells inducibly express T7 RNAP. Finally, we demonstrate that differentiation can enable the expression of even toxic functions, a feat not achieved to our knowledge by any other strategy for addressing long-term evolutionary stability. Overall, this study provides an effective generalizable strategy for protecting engineered functions from evolutionary degradation.",

    "abstract": "Ants are famous in the animal kingdom for their amazing load carriage performances. Yet, the mechanisms that allow these insects to maintain their stability when carrying heavy loads have been poorly investigated. Here we present a study of the kinematics of loaded locomotion in the polymorphic seed-harvesting ant Messor barbarus. In this species big ants have larger heads relative to their size than small ants. Hence, their center of mass is shifted forward, and the more so when they are carrying a load in their mandibles. We tested the hypothesis that this could lead to big ants being less statically stable than small ants, thus explaining their lower load carriage performances. When walking unloaded we found that big ants were indeed less statically stable than small ants but that they were nonetheless able to adjust their stepping pattern to partly compensate for this instability. When ants were walking loaded on the other hand, there was no evidence of different locomotor behaviors in individuals of different sizes. Loaded ants, whatever their size, move too slowly to maintain their balance through dynamic stability. Rather, they seem to do so by clinging to the ground with their hind legs during part of a stride. We show through a straightforward model that allometric relationships have a minor role in explaining the differences in load carriage performances between big ants and small ants and that a simple scale effect is sufficient to explain these differences.",

    "abstract": "The function and evolution of eukaryotic cells depends upon direct molecular interactions between gene products encoded in nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes. Understanding how these cytonuclear interactions drive molecular evolution and generate genetic incompatibilities between isolated populations and species is of central importance to eukaryotic biology. Plants are an outstanding system to investigate such effects because of their two different genomic compartments present in the cytoplasm (mitochondria and plastids) and the extensive resources detailing subcellular targeting of nuclear-encoded proteins. However, the field lacks a consistent classification scheme for mitochondrial- and plastid-targeted proteins based on their molecular interactions with cytoplasmic genomes and gene products, which hinders efforts to standardize and compare results across studies. Here, we take advantage of detailed knowledge about the model angiosperm Arabidopsis thaliana to provide a curated database of plant cytonuclear interactions at the molecular level. CyMIRA (Cytonuclear Molecular Interactions Reference for Arabidopsis) is available at http://cymira.colostate.edu/ and https://github.com/dbsloan/cymira and will serve as a resource to aid researchers in partitioning evolutionary genomic data into functional gene classes based on organelle targeting and direct molecular interaction with cytoplasmic genomes and gene products. It includes 11 categories (and 27 subcategories) of different cytonuclear complexes and types of molecular interactions, and it reports residue-level information for cytonuclear contact sites. We hope that this framework will make it easier to standardize, interpret and compare studies testing the functional and evolutionary consequences of cytonuclear interactions.",

We leveraged a new neural processing toolkit to investigate the choice of decoding algorithm, neural preprocessing, audio representation, channel count, and array location on neural decoding performance. The results illuminated a view of the auditory cortex as a spatially distributed network and a general purpose processor of complex sounds.

    "abstract": "The usefulness of Genomic Prediction (GP) in crop and livestock breeding programs has led to efforts to develop new and improved GP approaches including non-linear algorithm, such as artificial neural networks (ANN) (i.e. deep learning) and gradient tree boosting. However, the performance of these algorithms has not been compared in a systematic manner using a wide range of GP datasets and models. Using data of 18 traits across six plant species with different marker densities and training population sizes, we compared the performance of six linear and five non-linear algorithms, including ANNs. First, we found that hyperparameter selection was critical for all non-linear algorithms and that feature selection prior to model training was necessary for ANNs when the markers greatly outnumbered the number of training lines. Across all species and trait combinations, no one algorithm performed best, however predictions based on a combination of results from multiple GP algorithms (i.e. ensemble predictions) performed consistently well. While linear and non-linear algorithms performed best for a similar number of traits, the performance of non-linear algorithms vary more between traits than that of linear algorithms. Although ANNs did not perform best for any trait, we identified strategies (i.e. feature selection, seeded starting weights) that boosted their performance near the level of other algorithms. These results, together with the fact that even small improvements in GP performance could accumulate into large genetic gains over the course of a breeding program, highlights the importance of algorithm selection for the prediction of trait values.",

We assessed ICAs test-retest reliability, its correlation with BICAMS, its sensitivity to discriminate patients with MS from the HC group, and its accuracy in detecting cognitive dysfunction. In substudy 2, we recruited 48 MS patients, and examined the association between the level of serum neurofilament light (NfL) in these patients and their ICA scores.\\n\\nResultsICA demonstrated excellent test-retest reliability (r=0.94), with no learning bias (i.e. no significant practice effect); and had high level of convergent validity with BICAMS. ICA was sensitive in discriminating the MS patients from the HC group, and demonstrated a high accuracy (AUC = 95%) in discriminating cognitively normal from cognitively impaired participants.
