    "abstract": "Predictive models of signaling networks are essential tools for understanding cell population heterogeneity and designing rational interventions in disease. However, using network models to predict signaling dynamics heterogeneity is often challenging due to the extensive variability of signaling parameters across cell populations. Here, we describe a Maximum Entropy-based fRamework for Inference of heterogeneity in Dynamics of sIgAling Networks (MERIDIAN). MERIDIAN allows us to estimate the joint probability distribution over signaling parameters that is consistent with experimentally observed cell-to-cell variability in abundances of network species. We apply the developed approach to investigate the heterogeneity in the signaling network activated by the epidermal growth factor (EGF) and leading to phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt). Using the inferred parameter distribution, we also predict heterogeneity of phosphorylated Akt levels and the distribution of EGF receptor abundance hours after EGF stimulation. We discuss how MERIDIAN can be generalized and applied to problems beyond modeling of heterogeneous signaling dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Chemosensory proteins (CSPs) are small globular proteins with hydrophobic binding pockets that have a role in detection of chemicals, regulation of development and growth and host seeking behaviour and feeding of arthropods. Here, we show that a CSP has evolved to modulate plant immune responses. Firstly, we found that the green peach aphid Myzus persicae CSP Mp10, which is delivered into the cytoplasm of plant cells, suppresses the reactive oxygen species (ROS) bursts to both aphid and bacterial elicitors in Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana benthamiana. Aphid RNA interference studies demonstrated that Mp10 modulates the first layer of the plant defence response, specifically the BAK1 pathway. We identified Mp10 homologs in diverse plant-sucking insect species, including aphids, whiteflies, psyllids and leafhoppers, but not in other insect species, including blood-feeding hemipteran insects. We found that Mp10 homologs from other splant-sucking insect species are also capable of suppressing plant ROS. Together, these data and phylogenetic analyses provides evidence that an ancestral Mp10-like sequence acquired plant ROS suppression activity before the divergence of plant-sucking insect species over 250 million years ago.\\n\\nSignificanceAphids, whiteflies, psyllids, leafhoppers and planthoppers are plant-sucking insects of the order Hemiptera that cause dramatic crop losses via direct feeding damage and vectoring of plant pathogens. Chemosensory proteins (CSPs) regulate behavioural and developmental processes in arthropods. Here we show that the CSP Mp10 of the green peach aphid Myzus persicae is an effector that suppresses plant reactive oxygen species (ROS) bursts and the first layer of plant defence responses. Surprisingly, Mp10 homologs are present in diverse plant-feeding hemipteran species, but not blood-feeding ones. An ancestral Mp10-like sequence most likely acquired ROS suppression activity before the divergence of plant-sucking insect species 250 million years ago.",

    "abstract": "Rapidly evolving RNA viruses continuously produce minority haplotypes that can become dominant if they are drug-resistant or can better evade the immune system. Therefore, early detection and identification of minority viral haplotypes may help to promptly adjust the patient's treatment plan preventing potential disease complications. Minority haplotypes can be identified using next-generation sequencing (NGS), but sequencing noise hinders accurate identification. The elimination of sequencing noise is a non-trivial task that still remains open. Here we propose CliqueSNV based on extracting pairs of statistically linked mutations from noisy reads. This effectively reduces sequencing noise and enables identifying minority haplotypes with the frequency below the sequencing error rate. We comparatively assess the performance of CliqueSNV using an in vitro mixture of nine haplotypes that were derived from the mutation profile of an existing HIV patient. We show that CliqueSNV can accurately assemble viral haplotypes with frequencies as low as 0.1% and maintains consistent performance across short and long bases sequencing platforms.",

    "abstract": "ATP synthase (F1Fo) synthesizes daily our bodys weight in ATP, whose production-rate can be transiently increased several-fold. Using purified mammalian F1Fo-reconstituted proteoliposomes and isolated mitochondria, we show that F1Fo utilizes both H+- and K+-transport (because of >106-fold K+ excess vs H+) to drive ATP synthesis with the H+:K+ permeability of ~106:1. F1Fo can be upregulated by endogenous survival-related proteins (Bcl-xL, Mcl-1) and synthetic molecules (diazoxide, pinacidil) to increase its chemo-mechanical efficiency via IF1. Increasing K+- and H+-driven ATP synthesis enables F1Fo to operate as a primary mitochondrial K+-uniporter regulating energy supply-demand matching, and as the recruitable mitochondrial KATP-channel that can limit ischemia-reperfusion injury. Isolated mitochondria in the presence of K+ can sustain ~3.5-fold higher ATP-synthesis-flux (vs K+ absence) driven by a 2.7:1 K+:H+ stoichiometry with unaltered OxPhos coupling. Excellent agreement between F1Fo single-molecule and intact-mitochondria experiments is consistent with K+-transport through ATP synthase driving a major fraction of ATP synthesis.",

The occurrences of DBM larvae in greenhouses followed their occurrence in the surrounding area: however, some occurrences of DBM in greenhouses took place when the DBM population in the surrounding was rather low. This suggests that the occurrence of DBM in greenhouses cannot always be explained by its seasonal occurrence in the surrounding areas. The occurrence of C. vestalis followed that of DBM larvae in mizuna greenhouses and in the surrounding areas. No C. vestalis were recorded in greenhouses when DBM was not present. Cotesia vestalis females preferred volatiles emitted from DBM-infested mizuna plants to those from uninfested conspecifics under laboratory conditions. Natural HIPVs (herbivory-induced plant volatiles) emitted from DBM-infested mizuna plants in greenhouses probably attracted C. vestalis from the surrounding area to cause their co-occurrence.",

    "abstract": "Intraspecific trait variation is caused by genetic and plastic responses to environment. This intraspecific diversity is captured in immense natural history collections, giving us a window into trait variation across continents and through centuries of environmental shifts. Here we tested if hypotheses based on life history and the leaf economics spectrum explain intraspecific trait changes across global spatiotemporal environmental gradients. We measured phenotypes on a 216-year time series of Arabidopsis thaliana accessions from across the native range and applied spatially varying coefficient models to quantify region-specific trends in trait coordination and trait responses to climate gradients. All traits exhibited significant change across space and/or through time. For example, {delta}15N decreased over time across much of the range and leaf C:N increased, consistent with predictions based on anthropogenic changes in land use and atmosphere. Plants were collected later in the growing season in more recent years in many regions, possibly because populations shifted toward more spring germination and summer flowering as opposed to fall germination and spring flowering. When climate variables were considered, collection dates were earlier in warmer years, while summer rainfall had opposing associations with collection date depending on regions. There was only a modest correlation among traits, indicating a lack of a single life history/physiology axis. Nevertheless, leaf C:N was low for summer- versus spring-collected plants, consistent with a life history-physiology axis from slow-growing winter annuals to fast-growing spring/summer annuals. Regional heterogeneity in phenotype trends indicates complex responses to spatiotemporal environmental gradients potentially due to geographic genetic variation and climate interactions with other aspects of environment. Our study demonstrates how natural history collections can be used to broadly characterize trait responses to environment, revealing heterogeneity in response to anthropogenic change.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRelationships between specific microbes and proper immune system development, composition, and function have been reported in a number of studies. However, researchers have discovered only a fraction of the likely relationships. High-dimensional \\\"omic\\\" methodologies such as 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing and Time-of-flight mass cytometry (CyTOF) immunophenotyping generate data that support generation of hypotheses, with the potential to identify additional relationships at a level of granularity ripe for further experimentation. Pairwise linear regressions between microbial and host immune features is one approach for quantifying relationships between \\\"omes\\\", and the differences in these relationships across study cohorts or arms. This approach yields a top table of candidate results. However, the top table alone lacks the detail that domain experts need to vet candidate results for follow-up experiments.\\n\\nResultsTo support this vetting, we developed VOLARE (Visualization Of LineAr Regression Elements), a web application that integrates a searchable top table, small in-line graphs illustrating the fitted models, a network summarizing the top table, and on-demand detailed regression plots showing full sample-level detail. We applied VOLARE to three case studies--microbiome:cytokine data from fecal samples in HIV, microbiome:cytokine data in inflammatory bowel disease and spondyloarthritis, and microbiome:immune cell data from gut biopsies in HIV. We present both patient-specific phenomena and relationships that differ by disease state. We also analyzed interaction data from system logs to characterize usage scenarios. This log analysis revealed that, in using VOLARE, domain experts frequently generated detailed regression plots, suggesting that this detail aids the vetting of results.\\n\\nConclusionsSystematically integrating microbe:immune cell readouts through pairwise linear regressions and presenting the top table in an interactive environment supports the vetting of results for scientific relevance. VOLARE allows domain experts to control the analysis of their results, screening dozens of candidate relationships with ease. This interactive environment transcends the limitations of a static top table.",

    "abstract": "Making good decisions requires updating beliefs according to new evidence. This is a dynamical process that is prone to biases: in some cases, beliefs become entrenched and resistant to new evidence (leading to primacy effects), while in other cases, beliefs fade over time and rely primarily on later evidence (leading to recency effects). How and why either type of bias dominates in a given context is an important open question. Here, we study this question in classic perceptual decision-making tasks, where, puzzlingly, previous empirical studies differ in the kinds of biases they observe, ranging from primacy to recency, despite seemingly equivalent tasks. We present a new model, based on hierarchical approximate inference and derived from normative principles, that not only explains both primacy and recency effects in existing studies, but also predicts how the type of bias should depend on the statistics of stimuli in a given task. We verify this prediction in a novel visual discrimination task with human observers, finding that each observers temporal bias changed as the result of changing the key stimulus statistics identified by our model. By fitting an extended drift-diffusion model to our data we rule out an alternative explanation for primacy effects due to bounded integration. Taken together, our results resolve a major discrepancy among existing perceptual decision-making studies, and suggest that a key source of bias in human decision-making is approximate hierarchical inference.",

    "abstract": "A number of methods commonly used in landscape genetics use an analogy to electrical resistance on a network to describe and fit barriers to movement across the landscape using genetic distance data. These are motivated by a mathematical equivalence between electrical resistance between two nodes of a network and the \\\"commute time\\\", which is the mean time for a random walk on that network to leave one node, visit the other, and return. However, genetic data are more accurately modeled by a different quantity, the coalescence time. Here, we describe the differences between resistance distance and coalescence time, and explore the consequences for inference. We implement a Bayesian method to infer effective movement rates and population sizes under both these models, and find that inference using commute times can produce misleading results in the presence of biased gene flow. We then use forwards-time simulation with continuous geography to demonstrate that coalescence-based inference remains more accurate than resistance-based methods on realistic data, but difficulties highlight the need for methods that explicitly model continuous, heterogeneous geography.",

The expression of GhNAC4 was upregulated by ABA, cytokinin, JA, GA, auxin, and ethylene. Its expression was also highly induced by drought, osmotic stress, oxidative stress, salinity, high and low-temperature stress, and wounding. To corroborate these observations, we have conducted a spatio-temporal analysis of the promoter of the GhNAC4 gene, by using uidA (GUS) gene in a transcriptional fusion in transgenic tobacco. The GUS expression was mostly localized to the vascular bundles along with shoot apical meristem and guard cells. We also observed intense staining in other cells upon wounding. Sequence analysis of the promoter revealed the presence of several motifs pertaining to phytohormone responsiveness, stress-inducibility, light responsive, sugar-responsive and tissue-specificity. These data suggests that GhNAC4 is a vascular tissue localizing NAC transcription factor, which may act as a node integrating environmental stress signals for modulating plant growth and development with the aid of phytohormonal stimuli.\\n\\nKey messageGhNAC4 transcription factor from cotton, localizes to vascular bundles and is highly upregulated by phytohormones and environmental stresses.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary niche theory is a powerful conceptual framework for understanding how organisms interact with each other and with their shared environment. Here we show that a large segment of niche theory is equivalent to a Minimum Environmental Perturbation Principle (MEPP): ecosystems self-organize into a state that minimizes the impact of organisms on their environment. Different choices of environmental dynamics naturally give rise to distinct dissimilarity measures for quantifying environmental impact. The MEPP allows for the analysis of ecosystems with large numbers of species and environmental factors and provides a new avenue for analyzing ecological invasions. The MEPP also rigorously connects ecological bistability with the existence of multiple minima in a statistical-physics inspired landscapes. We show that the presence of environmental feedbacks where organisms can produce new resources in addition to depleting them violates the global MEPP. However, even in the presence of such feedbacks, a weaker, local version of the MEPP still applies in a limited region of resource space.",

The optical system consists of 96 microscopy units, where each unit is made out of a four element objective, made through a molded injection process, and a low cost CMOS camera chip. By illuminating the sample with angle varying light and applying Fourier Ptychography, we can improve the effective brightfield imaging numerical apertuure of the objectives from 0.23 to 0.3, and extend the depth of field from {+/-}5 m to {+/-}15 m. The use of Fourier Ptychography additionally allows us to computationally correct the objectives aberrations out of the rendered images, and provides us with the ability to render phase images. The 96 Eyes acquires raw data at a rate of 0.7 frame per second (all wells) and the data are processed with 4 cores of graphical processing units (GPUs; GK210, Nvidia Tesla K80, USA). The system is also capable of fluorescence imaging (excitation = 465 nm, emission = 510 nm) at the native resolution of the objectives.

    "abstract": "Genetic variation in host populations may lead to differential viral susceptibilities. Here, we investigate the role of natural genetic variation in the Intracellular Pathogen Response (IPR), an important antiviral pathway in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans against Orsay virus (OrV). The IPR involves transcriptional activity of 80 genes including the pals-genes. We examine the genetic variation in the pals-family for traces of selection and explore the molecular and phenotypic effects of having distinct pals-gene alleles. Genetic analysis of 330 global C. elegans strains reveals that genetic diversity within the IPR-related pals-genes can be categorized in a few haplotypes worldwide. Importantly, two key IPR regulators, pals-22 and pals-25, are in a genomic region carrying signatures of balancing selection, suggesting that different evolutionary strategies exist in IPR regulation. We infected eleven C. elegans strains that represent three distinct pals-22 pals-25 haplotypes with Orsay virus to determine their susceptibility. For two of these strains, N2 and CB4856, the transcriptional response to infection was also measured. The results indicate that pals-22 pals-25 haplotype shapes the defense against OrV and host genetic variation can result in constitutive activation of IPR genes. Our work presents evidence for balancing genetic selection of immunity genes in C. elegans and provides a novel perspective on the functional diversity that can develop within a main antiviral response in natural host populations.",

    "abstract": "Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) can produce percepts that mimic somatic sensation and thus has potential as an approach to sensorize prosthetic limbs. However, it is not known whether ICMS could recreate active texture exploration--the ability to infer information about object texture by using ones fingertips to scan a surface. Here we show that ICMS of S1 can convey information about the spatial frequencies of invisible virtual gratings through a process of active tactile exploration. Two rhesus monkeys scanned pairs of visually identical screen objects with the fingertip of a hand avatar, controlled via a joystick and later via a brain-machine interface, to find the one with denser virtual gratings. The gratings consisted of evenly spaced ridges that were signaled through ICMS pulses generated when the avatars fingertip crossed each ridge. The monkeys learned to interpret these ICMS patterns evoked by the interplay of their voluntary movements and the virtual textures of each object. Discrimination accuracy across a range of grating densities followed Webers law of just-noticeable differences (JND), a finding that matches normal cutaneous sensation. Moreover, one monkey developed an active scanning strategy where avatar velocity was integrated with the ICMS pulses to interpret the texture information. We propose that this approach could equip upper-limb neuroprostheses with direct access to texture features acquired during active exploration of natural objects.",

Here, we present the Northeast Asian Reference Database (NARD), including whole-genome sequencing data of 1,781 individuals from Korea, Mongolia, Japan, China, and Hong Kong. NARD provides the genetic diversities of Korean (n=850) and Mongolian (n=386) ancestries that were not present in the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 (1KGP3). We combined and re-phased the genotypes from NARD and 1KGP3 to construct a union set of haplotypes. This approach established a robust imputation reference panel for the Northeast Asian populations, which yields the greatest imputation accuracy of rare and low-frequency variants compared with the existing panels. Also, we illustrate that NARD can potentially improve disease variant discovery by reducing pathogenic candidates. Overall, this study provides a decent reference panel for the genetic studies in Northeast Asia.",

    "abstract": "Learning can interfere with pre-existing memories that in classical neural networks may lead to catastrophic forgetting. Different from these networks, biological synapses show an early decay of long-term potentiation, combined with a tag & capture mechanism for selective consolidation. We present a 2-component synaptic plasticity model that, by an early decay and a tag & capture mechanism, enables context-dependent fast learning without catastrophic forgetting. For reinforcement learning in multiple contexts, the fast learning combined with an early weight decay maximizes the expected reward while minimizing interferences between subsequent contexts. Fast learning, enabled by a highly plastic weight component, improves performance for a given context. Between contexts this plastic component decays to prevent interference, but selective consolidation into a stable component protects old memories. As a downside of these mechanisms, learning is hampered when consolidation is triggered prematurely by interleaving easy and difficult tasks, consistent with human psychophysical experiments.",

Thus, IM is crucial for developing an efficient adaptive immune response against pathogenic micro-organisms, thereby preventing their colonization and subsequent infection. In the present study, we investigated the immune response to Encephalitozoon intestinalis-caused infection in the IM and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) in C57BL/6 female mice. To mimic an immunosuppressive condition, the mice were treated with cyclophosphamide (Cy). Histopathology revealed lymphoplasmacytic enteritis at 7 and 14 days-post-infection (dpi) in all infected groups; however, inflammation diminished at 21 and 28 dpi. Cy treatment also led to a higher number of E. intestinalis spores and lesions, which reduced at 28 dpi. In addition, flow cytometry analysis demonstrated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to be predominant immune cells, with a significant increase in both Th1 and Th2 cytokines at 7 and 14 dpi, as demonstrated by histopathology. In conclusion, Cy treatment reduced GALT (Peyers plaques and mesenteric lymph nodes) and peritoneum populations but increased the T-cell population in the intestinal mucosa and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which were able to eliminate this opportunistic fungus and reduced the infection.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods are typically unable to quantify the expression levels of all genes in a cell, creating a need for the computational prediction of missing values ( dropout imputation). Most existing dropout imputation methods are limited in the sense that they exclusively use the scRNA-seq dataset at hand and do not exploit external gene-gene relationship information. Further, it is unknown if all genes equally benefit from imputation or which imputation method works best for a given gene.\n\nHere, we show that a transcriptional regulatory network learned from external, independent gene expression data improves dropout imputation. Using a variety of human scRNA-seq datasets we demonstrate that our network-based approach outperforms published state-of-the-art methods. The network-based approach performs particularly well for lowly expressed genes, including cell-type-specific transcriptional regulators. Further, the cell-to-cell variation of 12.6% to 48.2% of the genes could not be adequately imputed by any of the methods that we tested. In those cases gene expression levels were best predicted by the mean expression across all cells, i.e. assuming no measurable expression variation between cells. These findings suggest that different imputation methods are optimal for different genes. We thus implemented an R-package called ADImpute (available via Bioconductor https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ADImpute.html) that automatically determines the best imputation method for each gene in a dataset.\n\nOur work represents a paradigm shift by demonstrating that there is no single best imputation method. Instead, we propose that imputation should maximally exploit external information and be adapted to gene-specific features, such as expression level and expression variation across cells.\n\nAuthor summarySingle-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows for gene expression to be quantified in individual cells and thus plays a critical role in revealing differences between cells within tissues and characterizing them in healthy and pathological conditions. Because scRNA-seq captures the RNA content of individual cells, lowly expressed genes, for which few RNA molecules are present in the cell, are easily missed. These events are called  dropouts and considerably hinder analysis of the resulting data. In this work, we propose to make use of gene-gene relationships, learnt from external and more complete datasets, to estimate the true expression of genes that could not be quantified in a given cell. We show that this approach generally outperforms previously published methods, but also that different genes are better estimated with different methods. To allow the community to use our proposed method and combine it with existing ones, we created the R package ADImpute, available through Bioconductor.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn eusocial ants, aggressive behaviors require a sophisticated ability to detect and discriminate between chemical signatures such as cuticular hydrocarbons that distinguish nestmate friends from non-nestmate foes. It has been suggested that a mismatch between a chemical signature (label) and the internal, neuronal representation of the colony odor (template) leads to the recognition of and subsequent aggression between non-nestmates. While several studies have demonstrated that ant chemosensory systems, most notably olfaction, are largely responsible for the decoding of these chemical signatures, a definitive demonstration that odorant receptors are responsible for the detection and processing of the pheromonal signals that regulate nestmate recognition has thus far been lacking. To address this, we have developed an aggression-based bioassay incorporating a suite of highly selective odorant receptor modulators to characterize the role of olfaction in nestmate recognition in the formicine ant Camponotus floridanus.\\n\\nResultsValidation of our aggression-based behavioral assay was carried out by demonstrating an antennal requirement for nestmate recognition. In order to adapt this bioassay for the volatile delivery of Orco modulators, electroantennography was used to show that both a volatilized Orco antagonist (VUANT1) and an Orco agonist (VUAA4) eliminated or otherwise interfered with the electrophysiological responses to the hydrocarbon decane, respectively. Volatilize administration of these compounds to adult workers significantly reduced aggression between non-nestmates without altering aggression levels between nestmates but did not alter aggressive responses towards a mechanical stimulus.\\n\\nConclusionsOur studies provide direct evidence that the antennae (as olfactory appendages) and odorant receptors (at the molecular level) are necessary for mediating aggression towards non-nestmates. Furthermore, our observations support a hypothesis in which rejection of non-nestmates depends on the precise detection and decoding of chemical signatures present on non-nestmates as opposed to the absence of any information or the active acceptance of familiar signatures. In addition to describing a novel approach to assess olfactory signaling in genetically intractable insect systems, these studies contribute to a long-standing interest in odor coding and the molecular neuroethology of nestmate recognition.",

    "abstract": "The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, transmits several arboviruses of public health importance, including chikungunya and Zika. Since its introduction to the United States in 1985, the species has invaded over forty states, including temperate areas not previously at risk of Aedes-transmitted arboviruses. Mathematical models incorporate climatic variables in predictions of site-specific Ae. albopictus abundances to identify human populations at risk of disease. However, these models rely on coarse resolutions of environmental data that may not accurately represent the climatic profile experienced by mosquitoes in the field, particularly in climatically-heterogeneous urban areas. In this study, we pair field surveys of larval and adult Ae. albopictus mosquitoes with site-specific microclimate data across a range of land use types to investigate the relationships between microclimate, density of larval habitat, and adult mosquito abundance and determine whether these relationships change across an urban gradient. We find no evidence for a difference in larval habitat density or adult abundance between rural, suburban, and urban land classes. Adult abundance increases with increasing larval habitat density, which itself is dependent on microclimate. Adult abundance is strongly explained by microclimate variables, demonstrating that theoretically derived, lab-parameterized relationships in ectotherm physiology apply to the field. Our results provide support for the continued use of temperature-dependent models to predict Ae. albopictus abundance in urban areas.",

    "abstract": "Biological hydrolysis of cellulose above 70{degrees}C involves microorganisms that secrete free enzymes, and deploy separate protein systems to adhere to their substrate. Strongly cellulolytic Caldicellulosiruptor bescii is one such extreme thermophile, which deploys modular, multi-functional carbohydrate acting enzymes to deconstruct plant biomass. Additionally, C. bescii also encodes for non-catalytic carbohydrate binding proteins, which likely evolved as a mechanism to compete against other heterotrophs in carbon limited biotopes that these bacteria inhabit. Analysis of the Caldicellulosiruptor pangenome identified a type IV pilus (T4P) locus encoded upstream of the t[a]pirins, that is encoded for by all Caldicellulosiruptor species. In this study, we sought to determine if the C. bescii T4P plays a role in attachment to plant polysaccharides. The major C. bescii pilin (CbPilA) was identified by the presence of pilin-like protein domains, paired with transcriptomics and proteomics data. Using immuno-dot blots, we determined that the plant polysaccharide, xylan, induced production of CbPilA 10 to 14-fold higher than glucomannan or xylose. Furthermore, we are able to demonstrate that recombinant CbPilA directly interacts with xylan, and cellulose at elevated temperatures. Localization of CbPilA at the cell surface was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Lastly, a direct role for CbPilA in cell adhesion was demonstrated using recombinant CbPilA or anti-CbPilA antibodies to reduce C. bescii cell adhesion to xylan and crystalline cellulose up to 4.5 and 2-fold, respectively. Based on these observations, we propose that CbPilA and by extension, the T4P, plays a role in Caldicellulosiruptor cell attachment to plant biomass.\n\nIMPORTANCEMost microorganisms are capable of attaching to surfaces in part to persist in their environment. Here, we describe that the thermophilic, plant degrading bacterium, Caldicellulosiruptor bescii, uses type IV pili to attach to carbohydrates found in plant biomass. This ability is likely key to survival in environments where carbon sources are limiting, allowing C. bescii to compete against other plant degrading microorganisms. Interestingly, the carbohydrate that induced the highest expression of pilin protein was xylan, a hemicellulose that is not the majority polysaccharide in plant biomass. Not only do we demonstrate a direct interaction of the pilin with the polysaccharides, but also that cell attachment to polysaccharides can be disrupted by the addition of recombinant pilin and notably by antibody neutralization of the native pilin. This mechanism mirrors those recently described in pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria, and further supports the ancient origins of type IV pilus systems.",

    "abstract": "Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is widely used for profiling transcriptomes of individual cells. The droplet-based 10X Genomics Chromium (10X) approach and the plate-based Smart-seq2 full-length method are two frequently-used scRNA-seq platforms, yet there are only a few thorough and systematic comparisons of their advantages and limitations. Here, by directly comparing the scRNA-seq data by the two platforms from the same samples of CD45-cells, we systematically evaluated their features using a wide spectrum of analysis. Smart-seq2 detected more genes in a cell, especially low abundance transcripts as well as alternatively spliced transcripts, but captured higher proportion of mitochondrial genes. The composite of Smart-seq2 data also resembled bulk RNA-seq data better. For 10X-based data, we observed higher noise for mRNA in the low expression level. Despite the poly(A) enrichment, approximately 10-30% of all detected transcripts by both platforms were from non-coding genes, with lncRNA accounting for a higher proportion in 10X. 10X-based data displayed more severe dropout problem, especially for genes with lower expression levels. However, 10X-data can better detect rare cell types given its ability to cover a large number of cells. In addition, each platform detected different sets of differentially expressed genes between cell clusters, indicating the complementary nature of these technologies. Our comprehensive benchmark analysis offers the basis for selecting the optimal scRNA-seq strategy based on the objectives of each study.",

    "abstract": "Identification of the cis-regulatory elements controlling cell-type specific gene expression patterns is essential for understanding the origin of cellular diversity. Conventional assays to map regulatory elements via open chromatin analysis of primary tissues is hindered by heterogeneity of the samples. Single cell analysis of transposase-accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq) can overcome this limitation. However, the high-level noise of each single cell profile and the large volumes of data could pose unique computational challenges. Here, we introduce SnapATAC, a software package for analyzing scATAC-seq datasets. SnapATAC can efficiently dissect cellular heterogeneity in an unbiased manner and map the trajectories of cellular states. Using the Nystrom method, a sampling technique that generates the low rank embedding for large-scale dataset, SnapATAC can process data from up to a million cells. Furthermore, SnapATAC incorporates existing tools into a comprehensive package for analyzing single cell ATAC-seq dataset. As demonstration of its utility, SnapATAC was applied to 55,592 single-nucleus ATAC-seq profiles from the mouse secondary motor cortex. The analysis revealed [~]370,000 candidate regulatory elements in 31 distinct cell populations in this brain region and inferred candidate transcriptional regulators in each of the cell types.",

Three months old C57BL/6 mice were fed with control (AIN93M) or high-fat high sucrose (HFHS) diets for 21 weeks (CEUA/UFF #647/15).

    "abstract": "Shark and ray biodiversity is threatened primarily by overfishing and the globalisation of trade, and Europe has been one of the most documented heavily fished regions for a relatively long time. Yet, we have little idea of the conservation status of the hundreds of Data Deficient shark and ray species. It is important to derive some insight into the status of these species, both to understand global extinction rates and also to ensure that any threatened Data Deficient species are not overlooked in conservation planning. Here, we developed a biological and ecological trait model to predict the categorical conservation status of 26 Northeast Atlantic and 15 Mediterranean Sea Data Deficient sharks and rays. We first developed an explanatory model based on all species evaluated on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened SpeciesTM, using maximum body size, median depth (as a proxy for fisheries exposure), and reproductive mode, and then predicted the status of all Data Deficient species. Almost half of Northeast Atlantic (46%, n=12 of 26), and two-thirds of Mediterranean (67%, n=10 of 15) Data Deficient species are predicted to be in one of the three IUCN threatened categories. Northeast Atlantic Data Deficient species are predicted to be 1.2 times more threatened than evaluated species (38%, n=36 of 94), whereas threat levels in the Mediterranean Sea are relative for each (66%, n=38 of 58). This case study is intended for extrapolation to the global shark and ray dataset upon completion of the global IUCN Red List assessment. Trait-based, categorical prediction of conservation status is a cost-effective approach towards incorporating Data Deficient species into (i) estimates of lineage-wide extinction rates, (ii) revised protected species lists, and (iii) Red List Indices, thus preventing poorly known species from reaching extinction unnoticed.",

    "abstract": "Shifting geographical ranges of crop pests and pathogens in response to climate change pose a threat to food security (1, 2). The orange wheat blossom midge (Sitodiplosis mosellana Gehin) is responsible for significant yield losses in China (3), the worlds largest wheat producer. Here we report that rising temperatures in the North China Plain have resulted in a mean northward range shift of 3.3{degrees} (58.8 km per decade) from the 1950s to 2010s, which accelerated to 91.3 km per decade after 1985 when the highly toxic pesticide hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) was banned (4). Phenological matching between wheat midge adult emergence and wheat heading in this new expanded range has resulted in greater damage to wheat production. Around $286.5 million worth of insecticides were applied to around 19 million hectares in an attempt to minimize wheat midge damage to crops between 1985 and 2016. Despite use of these pesticides, wheat midge caused losses of greater than 0.95 million metric tons of grain during this period. Our results demonstrate the potential for indirect negative impacts of climate change on crop production and food security, and constitute the first large scale example of plant pest range shift due to global warming.",

    "abstract": "Natural microbial communities contain hundreds to thousands of interacting species. For this reason, computational simulations are playing an increasingly important role in microbial ecology. In this manuscript, we present a new open-source, freely available Python package called Community Simulator for simulating microbial population dynamics in a reproducible, transparent and scalable way. The Community Simulator includes five major elements: tools for preparing the initial states and environmental conditions for a set of samples, automatic generation of dynamical equations based on a dictionary of modeling assumptions, random parameter sampling with tunable levels of metabolic and taxonomic structure, parallel integration of the dynamical equations, and support for metacommunity dynamics with migration between samples. To significantly speed up simulations using Community Simulator, our Python package implements a new Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for finding equilibrium states of community dynamics that exploits a recently discovered duality between ecological dynamics and convex optimization. We present data showing that this EM algorithm improves performance by between one and two orders compared to direct numerical integration of the corresponding ordinary differential equations. We conclude by listing several recent applications of the Community Simulator to problems in microbial ecology, and discussing possible extensions of the package for directly analyzing microbiome compositional data.",

Streptomyces species encode paralogous Lsr2 proteins (Lsr2 and Lsr2-like, or LsrL), and we show here that of the two, Lsr2 has greater functional significance. We found that Lsr2 binds AT-rich sequences throughout the chromosome, and broadly represses gene expression. Strikingly, specialized metabolic clusters were over-represented amongst its targets, and the cryptic nature of many of these clusters appears to stem from Lsr2-mediated repression. Manipulating Lsr2 activity in model species and uncharacterized isolates resulted in the production of new metabolites not seen in wild type strains. Our results suggest that the transcriptional silencing of biosynthetic clusters by Lsr2 may protect Streptomyces from the inappropriate expression of specialized metabolites, and provide global control over Streptomyces arsenal of signalling and antagonistic compounds.",

    "abstract": "The cardiac muscle proteins, generating and regulating energy transduction during a heartbeat, assemble in the sarcomere into a cyclical machine repetitively translating actin relative to myosin filaments. Myosin is the motor transducing ATP free energy into actin movement against resisting force. Cardiac myosin binding protein C (mybpc3) regulates shortening velocity probably by transient N-terminus binding to actin while its C-terminus strongly binds the myosin filament. Inheritable heart disease associated mutants frequently modify these proteins involving them in disease mechanisms. Nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) cause single residue substitutions with independent characteristics (sequence location, residue substitution, human demographic, and allele frequency) hypothesized to decide dependent phenotype and pathogenicity characteristics in a feed-forward Neural network model. Trial models train and validate on a dynamic worldwide SNP database for cardiac muscle proteins then predict phenotype and pathogenicity for any single residue substitution in myosin, mybpc3, or actin. A separate Bayesian model formulates conditional probabilities for phenotype or pathogenicity given independent SNP characteristics. Neural/Bayes forecasting tests SNP pathogenicity vs (in)dependent SNP characteristics to assess individualized disease risk and in particular to elucidate gender and human subpopulation bias in disease. Evident subpopulation bias in myosin SNP pathogenicities imply myosin normally engages other sarcomere proteins functionally. Consistent with this observation, mybpc3 forms a third actomyosin interaction competing with myosin essential light chain N-terminus suggesting a novel strain-dependent mechanism adapting myosin force-velocity to load dynamics. The working models, and the integral myosin/mybpc3 motor concept, portends the wider considerations involved in understanding heart disease as a systemic maladaptation.",

    "abstract": "The 1.6 Mbp deletion on chromosome 3q29 is associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia, autism, microcephaly, and intellectual disability. Despite its importance towards neurodevelopment, the role of individual genes, genetic interactions, and disrupted biological mechanisms underlying the deletion have not been thoroughly characterized. Here, we used quantitative methods to assay Drosophila melanogaster and Xenopus laevis models with tissue-specific individual and pairwise knockdown of 14 homologs of genes within the 3q29 region. We identified developmental, cellular, and neuronal phenotypes for multiple homologs of 3q29 genes, potentially due to altered apoptosis and cell cycle mechanisms during development. Using the fly eye, we screened for 314 pairwise knockdowns of homologs of 3q29 genes and identified 44 interactions between pairs of homologs and 34 interactions with other neurodevelopmental genes. Interestingly, NCBP2 homologs in Drosophila (Cbp20) and X. laevis (ncbp2) enhanced the phenotypes of homologs of the other 3q29 genes, leading to significant increases in apoptosis that disrupted cellular organization and brain morphology. These cellular and neuronal defects were rescued with overexpression of the apoptosis inhibitors Diap1 and xiap in both models, suggesting that apoptosis is one of several potential biological mechanisms disrupted by the deletion. NCBP2 was also highly connected to other 3q29 genes in a human brain-specific interaction network, providing support for the relevance of our results towards the human deletion. Overall, our study suggests that NCBP2-mediated genetic interactions within the 3q29 region disrupt apoptosis and cell cycle mechanisms during development.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYRare copy-number variants, or large deletions and duplications in the genome, are associated with a wide range of neurodevelopmental disorders. The 3q29 deletion confers an increased risk for schizophrenia, autism, and microcephaly. To understand the conserved biological mechanisms that are disrupted by this deletion, we systematically tested 14 individual homologs and 314 pairwise interactions of 3q29 genes for neuronal, cellular, and developmental phenotypes in Drosophila melanogaster and Xenopus laevis models. We found that multiple homologs of genes within the deletion region contribute towards developmental defects, such as larval lethality and disrupted cellular organization. Interestingly, we found that NCBP2 acts as a key modifier gene within the region, enhancing the developmental phenotypes of each of the homologs for other 3q29 genes and leading to disruptions in apoptosis and cell cycle pathways. Our results suggest that multiple genes within the 3q29 region interact with each other through shared mechanisms and jointly contribute to neurodevelopmental defects.",

    "abstract": "The skin microbiome is an essential line of host defense against pathogens, yet our understanding of microbial communities and how they change when hosts become infected is limited. We investigated skin microbial composition in three North American bat species (Myotis lucifugus, Eptesicus fuscus, and Perimyotis subflavus) that have been impacted by the infectious disease, white-nose syndrome, caused by an invasive fungal pathogen, Pseudogymnoascus destructans. We compared bacterial and fungal composition from 154 skin swab samples and 70 environmental samples using a targeted 16S rRNA and ITS amplicon approach. We found that for M. lucifugus, a species that experiences high mortality from white-nose syndrome, bacterial microbiome diversity was dramatically lower when P. destructans is present. Key bacterial families--including those potentially involved in pathogen defense--significantly differed in abundance in bats infected with P. destructans compared to uninfected bats. However, skin bacterial diversity was not lower in E. fuscus or P. subflavus when P. destructans was present, despite populations of the latter species declining sharply from white-nose syndrome. The fungal species present on bats substantially overlapped with the fungal taxa present in the environment at the site where the bat was sampled, but fungal community composition was unaffected by the presence of P. destructans for any of the three bat species. This species-specific alteration in bat skin bacterial microbiomes after pathogen invasion may suggest a mechanism for the severity of WNS in M. lucifugus, but not for other bat species impacted by white-nose syndrome.",

Parkinsons disease onset and progression has also been linked with various environmental factors such as physical activity, exposure to pesticides, head injury, nicotine, and dietary factors.\\n\\nObjectivesIn this study, we used a transgenic mouse model overexpressing the complete human SNCA genes modeling familial and sporadic forms of Parkinsons disease to study whether environmental conditions such as standard versus enriched environment changes the gut microbiome and influences disease progression.\\n\\nMethodsWe performed 16S rRNA DNA sequencing on fecal samples for microbiome analysis and studied fecal inflammatory calprotectin from the colon of control and transgenic mice kept under standard environment and enriched environment conditions.\\n\\nResultsThe overall composition of the gut microbiota was not changed in transgenic mice compared with wild-type in enriched environment, however, individual gut bacteria at genus level such as Lactobacillus sp. were significantly changed in transgenic mice. Furthermore, enriched environment significantly reduced colon fecal inflammatory calprotectin protein in wild-type and transgenic enriched environment conditions compared to standard environment.\\n\\nConclusionOur data suggest that enriched social environment has a positive effect on the induction of SNCA mediated inflammation in the intestine by changing anti-inflammatory gut bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Previous evidence suggests different cortical areas naturally oscillate at distinct frequencies, reflecting tuning properties of each region. The concurrent use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) has been used to perturb cortical regions, resulting in an observed post-stimulation response that is maximal at the natural frequency of that region. However, little is known about the spatial extent of TMS-induced activation differences in cortical regions when comparing resting state (passive) versus active task performance. Here, we employed TMS-EEG to directly perturb three cortical areas in the right hemisphere while measuring the resultant changes in maximal evoked frequency in healthy human subjects during a resting state (N=12) and during an active sensorimotor task (N=12). Our results revealed that the brain engages a higher dominant frequency mode when actively engaged in a task, such that the frequency evoked during a task is consistently higher across cortical regions, regardless of the region stimulated. These findings suggest that a distinct characteristic of active performance versus resting state is a higher state of natural cortical frequencies.",

However, most currently available pathway analysis software provide little or no functionalities for analyzing multiple types of -omics data simultaneously. In addition, most tools do not provide sample-specific estimates of pathway activities, which are important for precision medicine. To address these challenges, we present pathwayPCA, a unique R package for integrative pathway analysis that utilizes modern statistical methodology including supervised PCA and adaptive elastic-net PCA for principal component analysis. pathwayPCA can analyze continuous, binary, and survival outcomes in studies with multiple covariate and/or interaction effects. We provide three case studies to illustrate pathway analysis with gene selection, integrative analysis of multi-omics datasets to identify driver genes, estimating and visualizing sample-specific pathway activities in ovarian cancer, and identifying sex-specific pathway effects in kidney cancer. pathwayPCA is an open source R package, freely available to the research community. We expect pathwayPCA to be a useful tool for empowering the wide scientific community on the analyses and interpretation of the wealth of multiomics data recently made available by TCGA, CPTAC and other large consortiums.",

In addition, signaling pathways in breast cancer have been extensively studied as therapeutic targets due to their roles in tumor growth and metastasis. However, it is challenging to put signaling pathways and gene expression profiles together to characterise biological mechanisms of breast cancer subtypes since many signaling events result from post-translational modifications, rather than gene expression differences.\\n\\nWe present a logic-based approach to explain the differences in gene expression profiles among breast cancer subtypes using Pathway Logic and transcriptional network information. Pathway Logic is a rewriting-logic-based formal system for modeling biological pathways including post-translational modifications. Proposed method demonstrated its utility by constructing subtype-specific path from key receptors (TNFR, TGFBR1 and EGFR) to key transcription factor (TF) regulators (RELA, ATF2, SMAD3 and ELK1) and identifying potential pathway crosstalk via TFs in basal-specific paths, which could provide a novel insight on aggressive breast cancer subtypes.\\n\\nAvailabilityAnalysis result is available at http://epigenomics.snu.ac.kr/PL/",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria produce toxic secondary metabolites for reasons hitherto unclear. Using a phylogenetic approach that accounts for the high complexity of biosynthetic gene clusters (full or partial inversions, variable length, different number of genes, non-orthologues), we analyzed the sequences of 76 biosynthetic gene clusters covering 19 cyanotoxins. The phylogenetic tree of biosynthetic gene clusters branches first according to the bioactivity of the toxic metabolite (molecular target in another organism), then according to the chemical class and chemical structure of the secondary metabolite, and finally according to the organism and area of origin. The bioactivity of a toxic metabolite can be deduced directly from the nucleotide sequence of the biosynthetic gene cluster, without needing to examine the enzymes themselves or to measure expression levels. Bioactivity may have been the primary driving force behind the diversity of secondary metabolism in cyanobacteria. This genetic machinery evolved to facilitate three specific survival strategies acting separately or in tandem, with dominant cyanobacteria possessing the genetic machinery to support all three strategies. Transmembrane (direct) toxicity targeting ion channels, intracellular (indirect) toxicity targeting cell-cycle regulation, and digestion inhibition targeting proteases may have provided the survival advantage underpinning the evolutionary success of both cyanobacteria and their early symbiotic hosts.",

Here, we characterized the effects of different types of sugar and lipids on the growth and development of Caenorhabditis elegans. We measured the lifespan, reproductive capacity, and length of nematodes after sugars and lipids treatment alone and co-treatment of sugars and lipids. Furthermore, by using transcriptome sequencing technology, we studied the mechanisms underlying the damaged caused by high-sucrose and high-stearic acid on C. elegans. The results showed that a certain concentration of sugar and lipid promoted the growth and development of nematodes. However, excessive sugars and lipids shortened the lifespan and length of nematodes and destroyed their reproductive capacity. Based on the results of the orthogonal test, we selected 400 mmol/L sucrose and 500 g/mL stearic acid to model a high-sugar and high-lipid diet for C. elegans. High-sugar and high-lipid intake altered the expression of genes involved in biofilm synthesis, genes that catalyze the synthesis and degradation of endogenous substances, and genes involved in innate immunity, resulting in physiological damage.",

    "abstract": "Total brain white matter lesion (WML) volume is the most widely established magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcome measure in studies of multiple sclerosis (MS). To estimate WML volume, there are a number of automatic segmentation methods, yet, manual delineation remains the gold standard approach. These approaches often yield a probability map to which a threshold is applied to create lesion segmentation masks. Unfortunately, few approaches systematically determine the threshold employed; many methods use a manually selected threshold, thus introducing human error and bias into the automated procedure. In this study, we propose and validate an automatic thresholding algorithm, Thresholding Approach for Probability Map Automatic Segmentation in Multiple Sclerosis (TAPAS), to obtain subject-specific threshold estimates for probability map automatic segmentation of T2-weighted (T2) hyperintense WMLs. Using multimodal MRI, the proposed method applies an automatic segmentation algorithm to obtain probability maps. We obtain the true subject-specific threshold that maximizes Sorensen-Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). Then the subject-specific thresholds are modeled on a naive estimate of volume using a general additive model. Applying this model, we predict a subject-specific threshold in data not used for training. We ran a Monte Carlo-resampled split-sample cross-validation (100 validation sets) using two data sets: the first obtained from the Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) on a Philips 3 Tesla (3T) scanner (n = 94) and a second collected at the Brigham and Womens Hospital (BWH) using a Siemens 3T scanner (n = 40). By means of the proposed automated technique, in the JHH data, we found an average reduction in subject-level absolute error of 0.1 mL per one mL increase in manual volume. Using Bland-Altman analysis, we found that volumetric bias associated with group-level thresholding is mitigated when applying TAPAS. The BWH data showed similar absolute error estimates using group-level thresholding or TAPAS likely since Bland-Altman analyses indicate no systematic biases associated with group or TAPAS volume estimates. The current study presents the first validated fully automated method for subject-specific threshold prediction to segment brain lesions.",

Protein glycosylation is ubiquitous in brain tissue and site-specific analysis of N-glycoproteome, which is technically challenging, can advance our understanding of the glycoproteins role in AD. In this study, we profiled the multilayered variations in proteins, N-glycosites, N-glycans, and in particular site-specific N-glycopeptides in the APP/PS1 and wild type mouse brain through combining pGlyco 2.0 strategy with other quantitative N-glycoproteomic strategies. The comprehensive brain N-glycoproteome landscape was constructed, and rich details of the heterogeneous site-specific protein N-glycosylations were exhibited. Quantitative analyses explored generally downregulated N-glycosylation involving proteins such as glutamate receptors, as well as fucosylated and oligo-mannose type glycans in APP/PS1 mice versus wild type mice. Moreover, our preliminary functional study revealed that N-glycosylation was crucial for the membrane localization of NCAM1 and for maintaining the excitability and viability of neuron cells. Our work offered a panoramic view of the N-glycoproteomes in Alzheimers disease and revealed that generally impaired N-glycosylation promotes Alzheimers disease progression.",

Now, coupled with massively-parallel, short-read sequencing, the family of RAD protocols that wields these enzymes has generated vast genetic knowledge from the natural world. Here we describe the first software capable of using paired-end sequencing to derive short contigs from de novo RAD data natively. Stacks version 2 employs a de Bruijn graph assembler to build contigs from paired-end reads and overlap those contigs with the corresponding single-end loci. The new architecture allows all the individuals in a meta population to be considered at the same time as each RAD locus is processed. This enables a Bayesian genotype caller to provide precise SNPs, and a robust algorithm to phase those SNPs into long haplotypes - generating RAD loci that are 400-800bp in length. To prove its recall and precision, we test the software with simulated data and compare reference-aligned and de novo analyses of three empirical datasets. We show that the latest version of Stacks is highly accurate and outperforms other software in assembling and genotyping paired-end de novo datasets.",

Hitherto, therapeutic strategies aiming to garner the efficacies of interferon responses are still limited. Here we show a novel strategy that elicits an interferon signature response while targeting both tumor cells using antineoplastic mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2) inhibitor and the TIME using toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7)-based immune adjuvant. The combination of MEK1/2 inhibitor and TLR7 agonist unlocked an interferon signature response unexpectedly in macrophages, which was otherwise tightly constrained by TLR7 agonist alone. Deficiency of interferon regulatory factor 1 (Irf1) completely abrogated the responses and prevented the reprogramming of activated macrophages, subduing them in an immunosuppressive state. In a murine melanoma model, combination therapy with TLR7 agonist and MEK1/2 inhibitor synergistically extended survival in wild-type but not Irf1-deficient mice. Specifically, we identified interferon response genes as favorable prognosis markers for cutaneous melanoma patients. Our findings demonstrate a novel strategy for combination therapy that targets both tumor cells and the immunosuppressive TIME through additive effects of monotherapies and synergistic interferon responses.",

Artificial neural networks, however, are considered black boxes, because they usually have thousands of parameters, making interpretation of their internal processes challenging. Here we systematically evaluate the use of CNNs for EEG signal decoding and investigate a method for visualizing the CNN model decision process.\\n\\nApproachWe developed a CNN model to decode the covert focus of attention from EEG event-related potentials during object selection. We compared the CNN and the commonly used linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier performance, applied to datasets with different dimensionality, and analyzed transfer learning capacity. Moreover, we validated the impact of single model components by systematically altering the model. Furthermore, we investigated the use of saliency maps as a tool for visualizing the spatial and temporal features driving the model output.\\n\\nMain resultsThe CNN model and the LDA classifier achieved comparable accuracy on the lower-dimensional dataset, but CNN exceeded LDA performance significantly on the higher-dimensional dataset (without hypothesis-driven preprocessing), achieving an average decoding accuracy of 90.7% (chance level = 8.3%). Parallel convolutions, tanh or ELU activation functions, and dropout regularization proved valuable for model performance, whereas the sequential convolutions, ReLU activation function, and batch normalization components, reduced accuracy or yielded no significant difference. Saliency maps revealed meaningful features, displaying the typical spatial distribution and latency of the P300 component expected during this task.\\n\\nSignificanceFollowing systematic evaluation, we provide recommendations for when and how to use CNN models in EEG decoding.

Herein, we are reporting the software GEAN which could lift over the reference gene structure annotation to other individuals belonging to the same or closely related species whose genome sequence was determined by whole-genome resequencing or de novo assembly. We found that inconsistent sequence alignment makes the coordinate lift over between different individual genomes unreliable, thus obscuring the lift over of gene structure annotations and genomic variants functional prediction. We designed a zebraic dynamic programming (ZDP) algorithm by providing different weights to different genetic features to refine the gene structure lift over. Using the lift over gene structure annotation as anchors, a base-pair resolution whole-genome-wide sequence alignment and variant calling pipeline for de novo assembly have been implemented. Taking Arabidopsis thaliana as example, we show that the natural variation alleles expression level of apoptosis death and defence response related genes might could be better quantified using GEAN. And GEAN could be used to refine the functional annotation of genetic variants, annotate de novo assembly genome sequence, detect syntenic blocks, improve the quantification of gene expression levels using RNA-seq data and genomic variants encoding for population genetic analysis.

    "abstract": "BackgroundWe have observed a negative correlation between rapid translation initiation of mRNA and their localization at mitochondria. One potential explanation of this anti-correlation is that mRNA which initiate translation away from mitochondria experience a significant drop in mobility and thus remain there. To explore this possibility, we conducted an initial simulation of diffusion and compared those results to gene-specific experimental measurements of mRNA mitochondrial localization.\\n\\nMethodsHere, we conduct a follow-up simulation study to complement the initial one. In particular we attempt a more quantitative analysis, deriving linear scale estimates of mitochondrial localization probability from sequencing based measurements. We compare this data to simulated mitochondrial localization probabilities under a variety of simulation parameter settings.\\n\\nConclusionsWe conclude that if a change in mRNA mobility after translation initiation is a significant factor in explaining the negative correlation between mRNA localization and translation initiation efficiency, then 1) the effective diffusion coefficient of mRNA must be strongly reduced upon translation initiation (e.g. 20x) and 2) mRNA molecules which have not yet initiated translation when approaching a mitochondrial surface must have a non-zero probability of anchoring there.",

    "abstract": "Selaginellaceae has been repeatedly proved as monophyly by previous studies with only one genus being recognized. However, the subgeneric classification has been debated during the recent decades. Furthermore, phylogenetic position of the newly identified sanguinolenta group has not been resolved, varying depending on the datasets and analysis methods. We carried out the phylogenomic analyses of twenty-six species from Selaginellaceae with ten species being newly sequenced and three species representing the sanguinolenta group. Four of the ten newly sequenced plastomes are assembled into the complete molecules, whereas the other six species are only assembled into five to sixteen contigs owing to high numbers of repeats. The phylogenetic framework from our study is basically congruent with the subgeneric classification of Weststrand and Korall (2016b). The position of sanguinolenta group was resolved as the basal clade in subg. Stachygynandrum, which support the position {beta} proposed by Weststrand and Korall (2016a), also supported by the morphological characters of dimorphic vegetative leaves, monomorphic sporophylls and intermixed sporangial arrangements. Both values of dS, dN and GC content in Selaginellaceae plastomes were significantly higher than those of other lycophytes (Isoetaceae and Lycopodiaceae). The correlation analysis showed that the elevated synonymous substitution rate was significantly correlated with the high GC content in Selaginellaceae. Besides, the values of dS and dN differs significantly between branches in the phylogenetic tree of Selaginellaceae. We propose that both high GC content and the extensive RNA editing sites contributed to the elevated substitution rate in Selaginellaceae, and all of these three factors could influence the stability of phylogenetic topology of Selaginellaceae.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the factors that influence the outcome of crop interactions with microbes is key to managing crop diseases and improving yield. While the composition, structure and functional profile of crop microbial communities are shaped by complex interactions between the host, microbes and the environment, the relative contribution of each of these factors is mostly unknown. Here, we profiled the community composition of bacteria across leaves of 3,024 rice (Oryza sativa) accessions from field trials in China and the Philippines using metagenomics. Despite significant differences in diversity between environments, the structure and metabolic profiles of the microbiome appear to be conserved, suggesting that microbiomes converge onto core functions. Furthermore, co-occurrence analysis identified microbial hubs that regulate the network structure of the microbiome. We identified rice genomic regions controlling the abundance of these hubs, enriched for processes involved in stress responses and carbohydrate metabolism. We functionally validated the importance of these processes, finding that abundance of hub taxa was different in rice mutants with altered cellulose and salicylate accumulation, two major metabolites at the host-microbe interactions interface. By identifying key host genomic regions, host traits and hub microbes that govern microbiome composition, our study opens the door to designing future cropping systems.",

    "abstract": "Nursing home residents are at a greater risk of developing pressure injuries that develop into an open wound. Open wounds can be colonized with bacteria from multiple sources. Emerging evidence suggests the specific composition of the open wound microbial community can result in delayed wound healing and increased infection risk. Understanding the factors that influence microbial colonization of open wounds, can lead to the prevention of infections. The relationship between bacteria found in urine and that of open wounds, is currently unknown. Recent studies have shown that nursing home residents can harbor a urinary microbiota independent of symptoms and frequently experience urinary incontinence. To determine if the colonization of open wounds mirrors urinary colonization, we conducted a pilot study with nursing home residents, comparing bacteria present in open pressure injuries below the umbilicus and urine. To identify microbial species that were present in both urine and open wound at one timepoint, standard bacteriologic culture techniques followed by MALDI-TOF was used as well as16S rRNA-encoding gene amplicon sequencing. In this study we found that some bacteria detected in urine were also detected in open wounds in one individual at one timepoint, using both culture dependent and independent techniques. Bacterial species that were more often detected at both sites included Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Providencia stuartii. This pilot study provides evidence that urinary colonization can mirror open wound colonization. Further studies are needed to investigate if parallel colonization of these anatomical sites affect infection outcomes.",

Here we used longitudinal calcium imaging in mice, multiple large virtual environments, and differing reward contingencies to derive a unified probabilistic model of hippocampal CA1 representations centered on a single feature - the field propensity. Each cells propensity governs how many place fields it has per unit space, predicts its reward-related activity, and is preserved across distinct environments and over months. The propensity is broadly distributed--with many low, and some very high, propensity cells --and thus strongly shapes hippocampal representations. The result is a range of spatial codes, from sparse to dense. Propensity varied ~10-fold between adjacent cells in a salt-and-pepper fashion, indicating substantial functional differences within a presumed cell type. The stability of each cells propensity across conditions suggests this fundamental property has anatomical, transcriptional, and/or developmental origins.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) has phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous characteristics. A simulation study demonstrated that attempts to categorize patients with a complex disease into more homogeneous subgroups could have more power to elucidate hidden heritability.\n\nMethodsWe conducted cluster analyses using the k-means algorithm with a cluster number of 15 based on phenotypic variables from the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC). As a preliminary study, we conducted a conventional genome-wide association study (GWAS) with a dataset of 597 ASD cases and 370 controls. In the second step, we divided cases based on the clustering results and conducted GWAS in each of the subgroups vs controls (cluster-based GWAS). We also conducted cluster-based GWAS on another SSC dataset of 712 probands and 354 controls in the replication stage.\n\nResultsIn the preliminary study, we observed no significant associations. In the second step of cluster-based GWASs, we identified 65 chromosomal loci, which included 30 intragenic loci located in 21 genes and 35 intergenic loci that satisfied the threshold of P<5.0x10-8. Some of these loci were located within or near previously reported candidate genes for ASD: CDH5, CNTN5, CNTNAP5, DNAH17, DPP10, DSCAM, FOXK1, GABBR2, GRIN2A5, ITPR1, NTM, SDK1, SNCA and SRRM4. Of these 65 significant chromosomal loci, rs11064685 located within the SRRM4 gene had a significantly different distribution in the cases vs. controls in the replication cohort.\n\nConclusionsThese findings suggest that clustering may successfully identify subgroups with relatively homogeneous disease etiologies. Further cluster validation and replication studies are warranted in larger cohorts.",

    "abstract": "Neural oscillations are observed ubiquitously in the mammalian brain, but their stability is known to be rather variable. Some oscillations are tonic and last for seconds or even minutes. Other oscillations appear as unstable bursts. Likewise, some oscillations rely on excitatory AMPAergic synapses, but others are GABAergic and inhibitory. Why this diversity exists is not clear. We hypothesized Ca 2+ -dependent homeostasis could be important in finding an explanation. We tested this hypothesis in a highly simplified model of hippocampal neurons. In this model homeostasis profoundly alters the modulatory effect of neural oscillations. Under homeostasis, tonic AMPAergic oscillations actually decrease excitability and desynchronize firing. Tonic oscillations that are synaptically GABAergic-like those in real hippocampus-dont provoke a homeostatic response, however. If our simple model is correct, homeostasis can explain why the theta rhythm in the hippocampus is synaptically inhibitory: GABA has little to no intrinsic homeostatic response, and so can preserve the pyramidal cells natural dynamic range. Based on these results we can also speculate that homeostasis may explain why AMPAergic oscillations in cortex, and hippocampus, often appear as bursts. Bursts do not interact with the slow homeostatic time constant, and so retain their normal excitatory effect.\n\nNO_SCPLOWEWC_SCPLOWO_SCPCAP C_SCPCAPO_SCPLOWANDC_SCPLOW NO_SCPLOWOTEWORTHYC_SCPLOWThe intricate interplay of neuromodulators, like acetylcholine, with homeostasis is well known. The interplay between oscillatory modulation and homeostasis is not. We studied oscillatory modulation and homeostasis for the first time using a simplified model of hippocampus. We report a paradoxical result: Ca-mediated homeostasis causes AMPAergic oscillations to become effectively inhibitory. This result, along with other new observations, means homeostasis might be just as complex and important for oscillations as it is for other neuromodulators.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is characterized by a state of chronic, unresolved inflammation in insulin-targeted tissues. Obesity-induced inflammation accumulates proinflammatory macrophages in adipose tissue and liver. Proinflammatory cytokines released from tissue macrophages inhibits insulin sensitivity. Chromogranin A (CgA) peptide catestatin (CST: hCgA352-372) improves obesity-induced hepatic insulin resistance by reducing inflammation and inhibiting proinflammatory macrophage infiltration. Obesity leads to inflammation-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and insulin resistance. We reasoned that the anti-inflammatory effects of CST would alleviate ER stress. CST decreased obesity-induced ER dilation in hepatocytes and macrophages. CST reduced phosphorylation of UPR signaling molecules and increased phosphorylation of insulin signaling molecules. We developed an in silico state space model mimicking dynamics of integrated ER stress and insulin pathways. Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers helped in checking whether the reduction of phosphorylated PERK resulting in attenuation of ER stress, resembling CST effect, could enhance insulin sensitivity. The simulation results showed CST not only decreased ER stress but also enhanced insulin sensitivity. Simulation results also revealed that enhancement of AKT phosphorylation overcame effects of high ER stress to achieve insulin sensitivity.",

Unfortunately, many neuroscience laboratories lack the computational expertise or resources to work with datasets of this size: computer vision tools are often not portable or scalable, and there is considerable difficulty in reproducing results or extending methods. We developed an ecosystem of neuroimaging data analysis pipelines that utilize open source algorithms to create standardized modules and end-to-end optimized approaches. As exemplars we apply our tools to estimate synapse-level connectomes from electron microscopy data and cell distributions from X-ray microtomography data. To facilitate scientific discovery, we propose a generalized processing framework, that connects and extends existing open-source projects to provide large-scale data storage, reproducible algorithms, and workflow execution engines.

A number of such stress-induced phenotypic switchings have been reported to be based on reactivation of hidden thresholds; under the normal condition, a high barrier separating alternative phenotypes ensures the expression of single discrete phenotype, but a severe perturbation can lower the barrier to a level at which to expose cryptic alternatives. While the importance of such threshold-based switches as the mechanism to generate adaptive novelties under variable environments has been appreciated, it still remains elusive how naturally selected organisms can maintain the phenotypic switching capability when such switching has been disused for a long period of time. Here, through the use of computer simulation, we analyzed adaptive evolution of gene circuits under stabilizing selection. We found that different strategies evolved to acquire reduced levels of gene expression noise around the optimum expression level. To incrementally improve the gene expression stability from a founding population with bistable individuals, the evolution consistently took the direction to raise the height of the potential barrier of bistable systems. Our results demonstrate that hidden phenotypic switches can be stably maintained during environmental stasis, facilitating the release of potentially adaptive phenotypic alternatives in the event of substantial perturbations.",

This breaks the dogma that {beta}-lactams enter Gram-negative bacteria only by passive diffusion through outer membrane porins. By confirming cross-resistance of Smlt0009 mutants with a siderophore-conjugated lactivicin antibiotic, we reveal that attempts to improve penetration of antimicrobials into Gram negative bacteria by conjugating them with TonB substrates is likely to select {beta}-lactam resistance in S. maltophilia, increasing its clinical threat.

Remarkably, therefore, {beta}-lactam use is already eroding the potential utility of currently experimental siderophore-conjugated antimicrobials against this species.",

    "abstract": "In a preliminary DNA-based microbiome studies, diverse culturable and unculturable bacterial taxa were identified in the roots and rhizospheres of different medicinal plants. In this report, culturable endophytic bacteria were isolated from four economically important medicinal plants Dodonaea viscosa, Fagonia indica, Caralluma tuberculata and Calendula arvensis. On the basis of initial antimicrobial screening, nine bacterial species in seven different genera, Streptomyces, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Bacillus, Pantoea, Pseudarthrobacter and Delftia, were selected for further analyses. These bacteria were identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Antimicrobial assays of these selected bacteria revealed that Pseudomonas taiwanensis has strong anti-Phytophthora activity. Volatiles produced by P. taiwanensis inhibited growth of P. parasitica more than 80%. Ethyl acetate extracts of S. alboniger MOSEL-RD3, P. taiwanensis MOSEL-RD23, E. hormaechei MOSEL-FLS1 and B. tequilensis MOSEL-FLS3 and D. lacustris MB322 also displayed high potency against P. parasitica. All these bacterial extracts showed strong inhibition against P. parasitica at different concentrations (4 {micro}g/mL - 400 {micro}g/mL). Bacterial extracts showing higher bioactivity (>80% inhibition in vitro) were selected for detached-leaf assay against P. parasitica on tobacco. In detached-leaf assay, application of 1% ethyl acetate bacterial extract of MOSE L-RD3, MOSEL-RD23, MOSEL-FLS1, MOSEL-FLS3 and MB322 reduced lesion sizes and lesion frequencies caused by P. parasitica by 68 to 81%. Over all P. taiwenensis MOSEL-RD23 showed positive activities for all the assays. Analysing the potential of bacterial endophytes as biological control agents can potentially lead to the formulation of broad-spectrum biopesticides for sustainable production of crops.",

    "abstract": "Post-transcriptional regulation plays important roles to finely tune gene expression in bacteria. In particular, regulation of type I toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems is achieved through sophisticated mechanisms involving toxin mRNA folding. Here, we set up a genetic approach to decipher the molecular underpinnings behind the regulation of a type I TA in Helicobacter pylori. We used the lethality induced by chromosomal inactivation of the antitoxin to select mutations that suppress toxicity. We found that single point mutations are sufficient to allow cell survival. Mutations located either in the 5 untranslated region or within the open reading frame of the toxin hamper its translation by stabilizing stem-loop structures that sequester the Shine-Dalgarno sequence. We propose that these short hairpins correspond to metastable structures that are transiently formed during transcription to avoid premature toxin expression. This work uncovers the co-transcriptional inhibition of translation as an additional layer of TA regulation in bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the gene AK2 are responsible for Reticular Dysgenesis (RD), a rare and severe form of primary immunodeficiency in children. RD patients have a severely shortened life expectancy and without treatment die a few weeks after birth. The only available therapeutic option for RD is bone marrow transplantation. To gain insight into the pathophysiology of RD, we previously created zebrafish models for an AK2 deficiency. One of the clinical features of RD is hearing loss, but its pathology and causes have not been determined. In adult mammals, sensory hair cells of the inner ear do not regenerate; however, their regeneration has been observed in several non-mammalian vertebrates, including zebrafish. Therefore, we use our RD zebrafish models to determine if AK2 deficiency affects sensory organ development and/or hair cell regeneration. Our studies indicated that AK2 is required for the correct development, survival and regeneration of sensory hair cells. Interestingly, AK2 deficiency induces the expression of several oxidative stress markers and it triggers an increased level of cell death in the hair cells. Finally, we show that glutathione treatment can partially rescue hair cell development in the sensory organs in our RD models, pointing to the potential use of antioxidants as a supportive therapeutic modality for RD patients, not only to increase their chances of survival, but to prevent or ameliorate their sensorineural hearing deficits.",

    "abstract": "Some animals respond to injury by inducing new growth to regenerate the lost structures. This regenerative growth must be carefully controlled and constrained to prevent overgrowth and to allow correct organization of the regenerating tissue. However, the factors that restrict regenerative growth have not been identified. Using a genetic ablation system in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc, we have identified one mechanism that constrains regenerative growth, impairment of which also leads to erroneous patterning of the final appendage. Regenerating discs with reduced levels of the RNA-regulator Brain tumor (Brat) exhibit enhanced regeneration, but produce adult wings with disrupted margins that are missing extensive tracts of sensory bristles. In these mutants, aberrantly high expression of the pro-growth factor Myc and its downstream targets likely contributes to this loss of cell-fate specification. Thus, Brat constrains the expression of pro-regeneration genes and ensures that the regenerating tissue forms the proper final structure.\n\nAuthor SummaryWhile much has been published about the signals that stimulate regeneration, the mechanisms that constrain and/or terminate regeneration have not been well characterized. Thus, we do not understand what limits may exist on the rate of regenerative growth, what mechanisms constrain regeneration, and what the consequences might be of enhancing regrowth. Here, we detail our discovery and characterization of a mechanism that constrains regeneration, and the deleterious effects of reducing that constraint. In this manuscript, we describe our identification of the RNA regulator Brat as a factor that constrains regenerative growth. Without this constraint on regenerative growth, patterning mistakes occur leading to a malformed regenerated structure. We demonstrate that the patterning errors are not due to faster growth itself, but are due to the overexpression of the pro-growth transcription factor Myc.",

    "abstract": "Group II introns are particularly plentiful within plant mitochondrial genomes (mtDNAs), where they interrupt the coding-regions of many organellar genes, especialy within complex I (CI) subunits. Their splicing is essential for the biogenesis of the respiratory system and is facilitated by various protein-cofactors that belong to a diverse set of RNA-binding cofactors. These including maturases, which co-evolved with their host-introns, and various trans-acting factors, such as members of the pentatricopeptide-repeat (PPR) protein family. The genomes of angiosperms contain hundreds of PPR-related genes that are postulated to reside within the organelles and affect diverse posttranscriptional steps, such as editing, RNA-stability and processing or translation. Here, we report the characterization of MSP1 (Mitochondria Splicing PPR-factor 1; also denoted as EMB1025), which plays a key role in the processing of nad1 pre-RNAs in Arabidopsis mitochondria. Mutations in MSP1 gene-locus (At4g20090) result in early embryonic arrest. To analyze the putative roles of MSP1 in organellar RNA-metabolism we used a modified embryo-rescue method, which allowed us to obtain sufficient plant tissue for the analysis of the RNA and protein profiles associated with msp1 mutants. Our data indicate that MSP1 is essential for the trans-splicing of nad1 intron 1 in Arabidopsis mitochondria. Accordingly, msp1 mutants show CI biogenesis defects and reduced respiratory-mediated functions. These results provide with important insights into the roles of nuclear-encoded factors during early plant development, and contribute to our limited understanding of the importance of RNA-maturation and splicing in plant mitochondria during early embryogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Dioecy, the presence of male and female individuals, has evolved independently in multiple flowering plant lineages. Although theoretical models for the evolution of dioecy, such as the \\\"two-mutation\\\" model, are well established, little is known about the specific genes determining sex and their evolutionary history. Kiwifruit, a major tree crop consumed worldwide, is a dioecious species. In kiwifruit, we had previously identified a Y-encoded sex-determinant candidate gene acting as the suppressor of feminization (SuF), named Shy Girl (SyGI). Here, we identified a second Y-encoded sex-determinant that we named Friendly boy (FrBy), which exhibits strong expression in tapetal cells. Gene-editing and complementation analyses in Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana tabacum indicated that FrBy acts for the maintenance of male (M) functions, independently of SyGI, and that these functions are conserved across angiosperm species. We further characterized the genomic architecture of the small (< 1 Mb) male specific region of the Y-chromosome (MSY), which harbors only two genes significantly expressed in developing gynoecia and androecia, respectively: SyGI and FrBy. Resequencing of the genome of a natural hermaphrodite kiwifruit revealed that this individual is genetically male but carries deletion(s) of parts of the Y-chromosome, including SyGI. Additionally, expression of FrBy in female kiwifruit resulted in hermaphrodite plants. These results clearly indicate that Y-encoded SyGI and FrBy act independently as the SuF and M factors in kiwifruit, respectively, and provide insight into the evolutionary path leading to a two-factor sex determination system but also a new breeding approach for dioecious species.",

    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), a common inheritable form of intellectual disability, is known to alter neocortical circuits. However, its impact on the diverse synapse types comprising these circuits, or on the involvement of astrocytes, is not well known. We used immunofluorescent array tomography to quantify different synaptic populations and their association with astrocytes in layers 1 through 4 of the adult somatosensory cortex of a FXS mouse model, the FMR1 knockout mouse. The collected multi-channel data contained approximately 1.6 million synapses which were analyzed using a probabilistic synapse detector. Our study reveals complex, synapse-type and layer specific changes in the neocortical circuitry of FMR1 knockout mice. In layers 1 and 2/3, there is a significant decrease in the density of excitatory glutamatergic synapses, both VGluT1 and VGluT2 type, and their association with astrocytes, while the changes in inhibitory GABAergic synapses are less pronounced. Meanwhile in layer 4, there is a significant increase in the density of small VGluT1 synapses, with no changes in the astrocytic association of synapses. The ability to dissect the circuit deficits by synapse type and astrocytic involvement, will be crucial for understanding how these changes affect circuit function, and ultimately define targets for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "The spinal cord contains a diverse array of interneurons that govern motor output. Traditionally, models of spinal circuits have emphasized the role of inhibition in enforcing reciprocal alternation between left and right sides or flexors and extensors. However, recent work has shown that inhibition also increases coincident with excitation during contraction. Here, using larval zebrafish, we investigate the V2b (Gata3+) class of neurons, which contribute to flexor-extensor alternation but are otherwise poorly understood. Using newly generated transgenic lines we define two stable subclasses with distinct neurotransmitter and morphological properties. These two V2b subclasses make direct synapses onto motor neurons with differential targeting to slower and faster circuits. In vivo, optogenetic suppression of V2b activity leads to increases in locomotor speed. We conclude that V2b neurons exert speed-specific influence over axial motor circuits throughout the rostrocaudal axis. Together, these results indicate a new role for ipsilateral inhibition in speed control.",

    "abstract": "A large space of chemicals with broad industrial and consumer applications could be synthesized by engineered microbial biocatalysts. However, the current strain optimization process is prohibitively laborious and costly to produce one target chemical and often requires new engineering efforts to produce new molecules. To tackle this challenge, modular cell design based on a chassis strain that can be combined with different product synthesis pathway modules has been recently proposed. This approach seeks to minimize unexpected failure and avoid task repetition, leading to a more robust and faster strain engineering process. The modular cell design problem was mathematically formulated using a multi-objective optimization framework.[1] In this study, we evaluated a library of the state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) to identify the most effective method to solve the modular cell design problem. Using the best MOEA, we found better solutions for modular cells compatible with many product synthesis modules. Furthermore, the best performing algorithm could provide better and more diverse design options that might help increase the likelihood of successful experimental implementation. We identified key parameter configurations to overcome the difficulty associated with multi-objective optimization problems with many competing design objectives. Interestingly, we found that MOEA performance with a real application problem, e.g., the modular strain design problem, does not always correlate with artificial benchmarks. Overall, MOEAs provide powerful tools to solve the modular cell design problem for novel biocatalysis.",
