    "abstract": "While both innate and adaptive immune system mechanisms have been implicated in resistance against the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatitis, studies on the role of specific MHC haplotypes on Bd infection are rare. Here, we studied latitudinal variation in MHC Class IIB loci along a latitudinal gradient from southern to northern Sweden in common toads, Bufo bufo. Swedish toad populations had fewer MHC Class IIB haplotypes compared to a previous study of populations in Britain. Furthermore, we found MHC diversity to decline from south to the north within Sweden. The low diversity may compromise the ability of northern populations to fight emerging disease, such as the chytrid fungus Bd. In a laboratory experiment, we infected newly metamorphosed toads with two strains of the Global Pandemic Lineage of the fungus (Bd-GPL) and compared survival with sham controls. We found Bd-infected toads had lower survival compared to controls. Survival was dependent on Bd-strain and whether experimental toads where collected in the south or the north of Sweden with lower survival in northern individuals. MHC diversity was lower in toads of northern origin, all northern animals being monomorphic for a single MHC haplotype, whereas we found seven different haplotypes in southern animals. Survival of infected animals was dependent on both Bd-strain and MHC haplotype suggesting differential infection dynamics depending on both Bd-strain and host MHC characteristics.",

    "abstract": "The cochlear nucleus (CN) transforms the spike trains of spiral ganglion cells into a new set of sensory representations that are essential for auditory discriminations and perception. These transformations require the coordinated activity of different classes of neurons that are embryologically derived from distinct sets of precursors. Decades of investigation have shown that the neurons of the CN are differentiated by their ion channel expression and intrinsic excitability. In the present study we have used linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to perform an unbiased analysis of measures of the responses of CN neurons to current injections to mathematically separate cells on the basis of both morphology and physiology. Recordings were made from cells in brain slices from CBA mice and a transgenic mouse line, NF107, crossed against the Ai32 line. For each cell, responses to current injections were analyzed for spike rate, spike shape (action potential height, afterhyperpolarization depth, first spike half-width), input resistance, resting membrane potential, membrane time constant, hyperpolarization-activated sag and time constant. Cells were filled with dye for morphological classification, and visually classified according to published accounts. The different morphological classes of cells were separated with the LDA. Ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) bushy cells, planar multipolar (T-stellate) cells, and radiate multipolar (D-stellate) cells were in separate clusters, and were also separated from all of the neurons from the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN). Within the DCN, the pyramidal cells and tuberculoventral cells were largely separated from a distinct clusters of cartwheel cells. DCN cells fell largely within a plane in the first 3 principal axes, whereas VCN cells were in 3 clouds approximately orthogonal to this plane. VCN neurons from the two mouse strains were slightly separated, indicating either a strain dependence or the differences in slice preparation methods. We conclude that cochlear nucleus neurons can be objectively distinguished based on their intrinsic electrical properties, but that such distinctions are still best aided by morphological identification.",

    "abstract": "Back in 2012, Churchland and his colleagues proposed that \\\"rotational dynamics\\\", uncovered through linear transformations of multidimensional neuronal data, represent a fundamental type of neuronal population processing in a variety of organisms, from the isolated leech central nervous system to the primate motor cortex. Here, we evaluated this claim using Churchlands own data and simple simulations of neuronal responses. We observed that rotational patterns occurred in neuronal populations when (1) there was a temporal shift in peak firing rates exhibited by individual neurons, and (2) the temporal sequence of peak rates remained consistent across different experimental conditions. Provided that such a temporal order of peak firing rates existed, rotational patterns could be easily obtained using a rather arbitrary computer simulation of neural activity; modeling of any realistic properties of motor cortical responses was not needed. Additionally, arbitrary traces, such as Lissajous curves, could be easily obtained from Churchlands data with multiple linear regression. While these observations suggest that temporal sequences of neuronal responses could be visualized as rotations with various methods, we express doubt about Churchland et al.s exaggerated assessment that such rotations are related to \\\"an unexpected yet surprisingly simple structure in the population response\\\", which \\\"explains many of the confusing features of individual neural responses.\\\" Instead, we argue that their approach provides little, if any, insight on the underlying neuronal mechanisms employed by neuronal ensembles to encode motor behaviors in any species.",

    "abstract": "The biology of bacterial cells is, in general, based on the information encoded on circular chromosomes. Regulation of chromosome replication is an essential process which mostly takes place at the origin of replication (oriC). Identification of high numbers of oriC is a prerequisite to enable systematic studies that could lead to insights of oriC functioning as well as novel drug targets for antibiotic development. Current methods for identyfing oriC sequences rely on chromosome-wide nucleotide disparities and are therefore limited to fully sequenced genomes, leaving a superabundance of genomic fragments unstudied. Here, we present{gamma} BOriS (Gammaproteobacterial oriC Searcher), which accurately identifies oriC sequences on gammaproteobacterial chromosomal fragments by employing motif-based DNA classification. Using{gamma} BOriS, we created BOriS DB, which currently contains 25,827 oriC sequences from 1,217 species, thus making it the largest available database for oriC sequences to date.",

    "abstract": "Scent marks are important mediators of territorial behavior and sexual selection in many species, especially among mammals. As such, the evolution of compounds used in scent marks has the potential to inform our understanding of signal evolution in relation to social and sexual selection. A major challenge in studies of chemical communication is that the link between semiochemical compounds and genetic changes is often unclear. The major urinary proteins (MUPs) of house mice are elaborated pheromone blends that provide information on sex, status and individual identity. Importantly, MUPs are a direct protein product of genes, providing a clear link between genotype and phenotype. Here we examine the evolution of urinary pheromone signals among house mice and relatives by examining the sequences and patterns of expression of MUPs in the liver, where urine excreted MUPs are produced. MUP patterns have evolved among mouse species both by gene duplication and variation in expression. Notably, the sex-specificity of pheromone expression that has previously been assumed to be male-specific varies considerably across species. Our data reveal that individual identity signals in MUPs evolved prior to 0.35 million years ago and have rapidly diversified through recombining a modest number of perceptually salient amino acid variants. Amino acid variants are much more common on the exterior of the protein where they could interact with vomeronasal receptors, suggesting that perception have played a major role in shaping MUP diversity. Collectively, these data provide new insights into the diverse processes and pressures shaping pheromone signals, and suggest new avenues for using house mice and their wild relatives to probe the evolution of signals and signal processing.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive control over conflicting sensory input is central to adaptive human behavior. It might therefore not come as a surprise that past research has shown conflict detection in the absence of conscious awareness. This would suggest that the brain may detect conflict fully automatically, and that it can even occur without paying attention. Contrary to this intuition, we show that task-relevance is crucial for conflict detection. Univariate and multivariate analyses on electroencephalographic data from human participants revealed that when auditory stimuli are fully task-irrelevant, the brain disregards conflicting input entirely, whereas the same input elicits strong neural conflict signals when task-relevant. In sharp contrast, stimulus features were still processed, irrespective of task-relevance. These results show that stimulus properties are only integrated to allow conflict to be detected by prefrontal regions when sensory information is task-relevant and therefore suggests an attentional bottleneck at high levels of information analysis.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is characterized by progressive memory loss, and there is a pressing need to identify early pathophysiological alterations that predict subsequent memory impairment. Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) - electrophysiological signatures of memory reactivation in the hippocampus - are a compelling candidate for doing so. Mouse models of AD show reductions in both SWR abundance and associated slow gamma (SG) power during aging, but these alterations have yet to be directly linked to memory impairments. In aged apolipoprotein E4 knock in (apoE4-KI) mice - a model of the major genetic risk factor for AD - we found that reduced SWR abundance and associated CA3 SG power predicted spatial memory impairments measured 1-2 months later. Importantly, SWR-associated CA3 SG power reduction in young apoE4-KI mice also predicted spatial memory deficits measured 10 months later. These results establish features of SWRs as potential functional biomarkers of memory impairment in AD.",
