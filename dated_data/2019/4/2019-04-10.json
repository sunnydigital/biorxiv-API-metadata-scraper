    "abstract": "BackgroundThe sense of touch is a key component of motor function. Severe spinal cord injury (SCI) should essentially eliminate sensory information transmission to the brain, that originates from skin innervated from below the lesion. We assessed the hypothesis that, following SCI, residual hand sensory information is transmitted to the brain, can be decoded amongst competing sensorimotor signals, and used to enhance the sense of touch via an intracortically controlled closed-loop brain-computer interface (BCI) system.\\n\\nMethodsExperiments were performed with a participant who has an AIS-A C5 SCI and an intracortical recording array implanted in left primary motor cortex (M1). Sensory stimulation and standard clinical sensorimotor functional assessments were used throughout a series of several mechanistic experiments.\\n\\nFindingsOur results demonstrate that residual afferent hand sensory signals surprisingly reach human primary motor cortex and can be simultaneously demultiplexed from ongoing efferent motor intention, enabling closed-loop sensory feedback during brain-computer interface (BCI) operation. The closed-loop sensory feedback system was able to detect residual sensory signals from up to the C8 spinal level. Using the closed-loop sensory feedback system enabled significantly enhanced object touch detection, sense of agency, movement speed, and other sensorimotor functions.\\n\\nInterpretationTo our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of simultaneously decoding multiplexed afferent and efferent activity from human cortex to control multiple assistive devices, constituting a  sensorimotor demultiplexing BCI. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that sub-perceptual neural signals can be decoded reliably and transformed to conscious perception, significantly augmenting function.\\n\\nFundingInternal funding was provided for this study from Battelle Memorial Institute and The Ohio State University Center for Neuromodulation.",

    "abstract": "An increasing number of studies are using landscape genomics to investigate local adaptation in wild and domestic populations. The implementation of this approach requires the sampling phase to consider the complexity of environmental settings and the burden of logistic constraints. These important aspects are often underestimated in the literature dedicated to sampling strategies.\\n\\nIn this study, we computed simulated genomic datasets to run against actual environmental data in order to trial landscape genomics experiments under distinct sampling strategies. These strategies differed by design approach (to enhance environmental and/or geographic representativeness at study sites), number of sampling locations and sample sizes. We then evaluated how these elements affected statistical performances (power and false discoveries) under two antithetical demographic scenarios.\\n\\nOur results highlight the importance of selecting an appropriate sample size, which should be modified based on the demographic characteristics of the studied population. For species with limited dispersal, sample sizes above 200 units are generally sufficient to detect most adaptive signals, while in random mating populations this threshold should be increased to 400 units. Furthermore, we describe a design approach that maximizes both environmental and geographical representativeness of sampling sites and show how it systematically outperforms random or regular sampling schemes. Finally, we show that although having more sampling locations (between 40 and 50 sites) increase statistical power and reduce false discovery rate, similar results can be achieved with a moderate number of sites (20 sites). Overall, this study provides valuable guidelines for optimizing sampling strategies for landscape genomics experiments.",

The mechanisms by which impaired MeCP2 induces the pathological abnormalities in the brain are not understood. To understand the molecular mechanisms involved in disease, we used an RTT patient induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based model and applied an in-depth high-resolution quantitative mass spectrometry-based analysis during early stages of neuronal development. Our data provide evidence of proteomic alteration at developmental stages long before the phase that symptoms of RTT syndrome become apparent. Differences in expression profiles became more pronounced from early to late neural stem cell phases, although proteins involved in immunity, metabolic processes and calcium signaling were already affected at initial stages. These results can help development of new biomarkers and therapeutic approaches by selectively target the affected proteins in RTT syndrome.",

    "abstract": "A growing body of evidence highlights the intricate linkage of exteroceptive perception to the rhythmic activity of the visceral body. In parallel, interoceptive inference theories of emotion and self-consciousness are on the rise in cognitive science. However, thus far no formal theory has emerged to integrate these twin domains; instead most extant work is conceptual in nature. Here, we introduce a formal model of cardiac active inference, which explains how ascending cardiac signals entrain exteroceptive sensory perception and confidence. Through simulated psychophysics, we reproduce the defensive startle reflex and commonly reported effects linking the cardiac cycle to fear perception. We further show that simulated  interoceptive lesions blunt fear expectations, induce psychosomatic hallucinations, and exacerbate metacognitive biases. Through synthetic heart-rate variability analyses, we illustrate how the balance of arousal-priors and visceral prediction errors produces idiosyncratic patterns of physiological reactivity. Our model thus offers the possibility to computationally phenotype disordered brain-body interaction.",

    "abstract": "Drought is the most perilous abiotic stress that affects finger millet growth and productivity worldwide. For the successful production of finger millet, selection of drought tolerant varieties is necessary and critical stages under drought stress, germination and early seedling growth, ought to be fully understood. This study investigated the physiological and biochemical responses of six finger millet varieties (GBK043137, GBK043128, GBK043124, GBK043122, GBK043094 and GBK043050) under mannitol-induced drought stress. Seeds were germinated on sterile soil and irrigated with various concentrations of mannitol (200, 400 and 600 mM) for two weeks. Comparative analysis in terms of relative water content (RWC), chlorophyll, proline, and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents were measured the physiological and biochemical characteristics of drought stress. The results showed that increased level of drought stress seriously decreased germination and early seedling growth of finger millet varieties. However, root growth was increased. In addition, exposition to drought stress triggered a significant decrease in relative water content and chlorophyll content reduction the biochemical parameters assay showed less reduction of relative water content. Furthermore, oxidative damage indicating parameters such as proline concentration and MDA content increased. Varieties GBK043137 and GBK043094 were less affected by drought as shown by significant change in the physiological parameters. Our findings reveal the difference and linkage between the physiological responses of finger millet to drought and are vital for breeding and selection of drought tolerant varieties of finger millet. Further investigations on genomic and molecular to deeply insight the detail mechanisms of drought tolerance in finger millet need to explored.",

At the heart of the centromere is the centromere-specific histone H3 variant CENP-A/CENH3. Throughout the cell cycle the constitutive centromere associated network is bound to CENP-A chromatin, but how this protein network modifies CENP-A nucleosome dynamics in vivo is unknown. Here, we purify kinetochore associated native centromeric chromatin and analyze its biochemical features using a combinatorial approach. We report that kinetochore bound chromatin has strongly reduced DNA accessibility and a distinct stabilized nucleosomal configuration. Disrupting the balance between CENP-A and CENP-C result in reduced centromeric occupancy of RNA polymerase 2 and impaired de novo CENP-A loading on the centromeric chromatin fiber, correlating with significant mitotic defects. CENP-A mutants that restore the ratio rescue the mitotic defects. These data support a model in which CENP-C bound centromeric nucleosomes behave as a barrier to the transcriptional machinery and suggest that maintaining the correct ratio between CENP-A and CENP-C levels is critical for centromere homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "To separate replicated sister chromatids during mitosis, eukaryotes and prokaryotes have structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) condensin complexes that were recently shown to organize chromosomes by a process known as DNA loop extrusion. In rapidly dividing bacterial cells, the process of separating sister chromatids occurs concomitantly with ongoing transcription. How transcription interferes with the condensin loop extrusion process is largely unexplored, but recent experiments show that sites of high transcription may directionally affect condensin loop extrusion. We quantitatively investigate different mechanisms of interaction between condensin and elongating RNA polymerases (RNAP) and find that RNAPs are likely steric barriers that can push and interact with condensins. Supported by new Hi-C and ChIP-seq data for cells after transcription inhibition and RNAP degradation, we argue that translocating condensins must bypass transcribing RNAPs within ~2 seconds of an encounter at rRNA genes and within ~10 seconds at protein coding genes. Thus, while individual RNAPs have little effect on the progress of loop extrusion, long, highly transcribed operons can significantly impede the extrusion process. Our data and quantitative models further suggest that bacterial condensin loop extrusion occurs by two independent, uncoupled motor activities; the motors translocate on DNA in opposing directions and function together to enlarge chromosomal loops, each independently bypassing steric barriers in their path. Our study provides a quantitative link between transcription and 3D genome organization and proposes a mechanism of interactions between SMC complexes and elongating transcription machinery relevant from bacteria to higher eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundColorectal cancer (CRC) is still a leading cause of death worldwide. Recent studies have pointed to an important role of microRNAs carcinogenesis. In fact, several microRNAs have been described as aberrantly expressed in CRC tissues and in the serum of patients. More specifically, microRNAs with dual roles in both cancer and stem cell survival represent a potential source of novel molecular targets in CRC due to their described functions in normal and deregulated proliferation. However, the functional outcomes of microRNA aberrant expression still need to be explored at the cellular level. Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of microRNAs involved in the control of pluripotency of stem cells in the proliferation and cell death of a colorectal cancer cell line.\\n\\nMethodsWe performed transfection of 31 microRNA mimics in HCT116 CRC cells. Cell proliferation and cell death were measured after 4 days of treatment using fluorescence staining in a high content screening platform. Total number of live and dead cells were automatically counted and analyzed. To reveal mRNA targets, we used an oligonucleotide microarray. Functional classification of targets was done using DAVID tool. Gene expression of potential mRNA targets was performed by qPCR.\\n\\nResultsTwenty microRNAs altered the proliferation of HCT116 cells in comparison to control. Three microRNAs significantly repressed cell proliferation and induced cell death simultaneously (miR-22-3p, miR-24-3p, and miR-101-3p). Interestingly, all anti-proliferative microRNAs in our study had been previously described as poorly expressed in the CRC samples and were implicated in the disease. Microarray analysis of miR-101-3p targets revealed Wnt and cancer as pathways regulated by this microRNA. Specific repression of anti-apoptotic isoform of MCL-1, a member of the BCL-2 family, was also identified as a possible mechanism for miR-101-3p anti-proliferative/pro-apoptotic effect.\\n\\nConclusionsmicroRNAs described as upregulated in CRC tend to induce proliferation in vitro, whereas microRNAs described as poorly expressed in CRC halt proliferation and induce cell death in vitro. Selective inhibition of anti-apoptotic MCL-1 contributes to anti-tumoral activity of miR-101-3p.",

These interdependencies inspired a new view of multicellular organisms as \\\"metaorganisms\\\". The goal of the Collaborative Research Center \\\"Origin and Function of Metaorganisms\\\" is to understand why and how microbial communities form long-term associations with hosts from diverse taxonomic groups, ranging from sponges to humans in addition to plants.\\n\\nMethodsIn order to optimize the choice of analysis procedures, which may differ according to the host organism and question at hand, we systematically compared the two main technical approaches for profiling microbial communities, 16S rRNA gene amplicon- and metagenomic shotgun sequencing across our panel of ten host taxa. This includes two commonly used 16S rRNA gene regions and two amplification procedures, thus totaling five different microbial profiles per host sample.\\n\\nConclusionWhile 16S rRNA gene-based analyses are subject to much skepticism, we demonstrate that many aspects of bacterial community characterization are consistent across methods and that metagenomic shotgun results are largely dependent on the employed pipeline. The resulting insight facilitates the selection of appropriate methods across a wide range of host taxa. Finally, by contrasting taxonomic and functional profiles and performing phylogenetic analysis, we provide important and novel insight into broad evolutionary patterns among metaorganisms, whereby the transition of animals from an aquatic to a terrestrial habitat marks a major event in the evolution of host-associated microbial composition.",

We introduce a new class of large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LD-DMM) algorithms for generating dense atlas correspondences onto sparse 2D samples by introducing a field of hidden variables which must be estimated representing a large class of target image uncertainties including (i) unknown parameters representing cross stain contrasts, (ii) censoring of tissue due to localized measurements of target subvolumes and (iii) sparse sampling of target tissue sections. For prediction of the hidden fields we introduce the generalized expectation-maximization algorithm (EM) for which the E-step calculates the conditional mean of the hidden variates simultaneously combined with the diffeomorphic correspondences between atlas and target coordinate systems. The algorithm is run to fixed points guaranteeing estimators satisfy the necessary maximizer conditions when interpreted as likelihood estimators.

    "abstract": "Mechanisms that ensure repair of double-stranded DNA breaks play a key role in the integration of foreign DNA into the genome of transgenic organisms. After pronuclear microinjection, exogenous DNA is usually found in the form of concatemer consisting of multiple co-integrated transgene copies. Here we investigated contribution of various DSB repair pathways to the concatemer formation. We injected a pool of linear DNA molecules carrying unique barcodes at both ends into mouse zygotes and obtained 10 transgenic embryos with transgene copy number ranging from 1 to 300 copies. Sequencing of the barcodes allowed us to assign relative positions to the copies in concatemers and to detect recombination events that happened during integration. Cumulative analysis of approximately 1000 integrated copies revealed that more than 80% of copies underwent recombination when their linear ends were processed by SDSA or DSBR. We also observed evidence of double Holliday junction (dHJ) formation and crossing-over during the formation of concatemers. Additionally, sequencing of indels between copies showed that at least 10% of the DNA molecules introduced into the zygote are ligated by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Our barcoding approach documents high activity of homologous recombination after exogenous DNA injection in mouse zygote.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVETo study the accumulation of MS-risk resulting from different combinations of MS-associated conserved-extended-haplotypes of the MHC and three non-MHC risk-loci nearby genes EOMES, ZFP36L1, CLEC16A.\\n\\nBACKGROUNDDefining \\\"genetic-susceptibility\\\" as having a non-zero probability of developing MS, both theoretical considerations and epidemiological observations indicate that only 2.2-4.5% of northern-populations can possibly be \\\"genetically-susceptible\\\" to MS. Nevertheless, many haplotypes (both within the MHC and elsewhere) are unequivocally MS-associated and, yet, have population-frequencies of >20%. Such frequency-disparities underscore the complex-interactions that must occur between these \\\"risk-haplotypes\\\" and MS-susceptibility.\\n\\nDESIGN/MEHTODSThe WTCCC dataset was statistically-phased at the MHC and at three other susceptibility-regions. Haplotypes were stratified by their impact on \\\"MS-risk\\\". MS-associations for different combinations of \\\"risk-haplotypes\\\" were assessed. The appropriateness of both additive and multiplicative risk-accumulation models was determined.\\n\\nRESULTSCombinations of different \\\"risk-haplotypes\\\" produced an MS-risk that was considerably closer to an additive model than a multiplicative model. Nevertheless, neither of these simple probability-models adequately accounted for the accumulation of disease-risk in MS at these four loci.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\\"Genetic-susceptibility\\\" to MS seems to depend upon the exact state at each \\\"risk-locus\\\" and upon specific gene-gene combinations across loci. Moreover, \\\"genetic-susceptibility\\\" is both rare in the population and, yet, is a necessary condition for MS to develop in any individual. In this sense, MS is a \\\"genetic\\\" disease. Nevertheless although, \\\"genetic-susceptibility\\\" is a necessary condition for MS to develop, environmental factors (whatever these may be) and stochastic processes are also necessary determinants of whether a \\\"genetically-susceptible\\\" individual will actually get MS.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryDefining a \\\"genetically-susceptible\\\" individual to be any person in the population who has any chance of developing multiple sclerosis (MS), we demonstrate that, at a theoretical level and using widely-accepted epidemiological observations, only 2.2-4.5% of individuals in northern populations can possibly be \\\"genetically susceptible\\\" to MS. Thus, more than 95.5% of individuals in these populations have no chance of getting MS, regardless of the environmental circumstances that they may experience.\\n\\nNevertheless, certain \\\"susceptibility-haplotypes\\\" (e.g., HLA-DRB1*15:01~DQB1*06:02) have a far greater carrier-frequency than 2.2-4.5%. Consequently, most carriers of these \\\"susceptibility-haplotypes\\\" have no chance of getting MS and, therefore, their \\\"susceptibility\\\" must arise from some combination of these haplotypes with other \\\"susceptibility-haplotypes\\\". By analyzing such combinatorial impacts at four susceptibility-loci, we found significant interactions both within and between the different \\\"susceptibility-haplotypes\\\", thereby confirming the relationship between \\\"genetic-susceptibility\\\" and specific gene-gene combinations.\\n\\nThe nature of \\\"genetic-susceptibility\\\" developed here is applicable to other complex genetic disorders. Indeed, any disease for which the MZ-twin concordance rate is substantially greater than the life-time risk in the general population, only a small fraction of the population can possibly be in the \\\"genetically-susceptible\\\" subset (i.e., have any chance of developing the disease).",

    "abstract": "Presepsin, a glycoprotein produced during bacterial phagocytosis, has attracted attention as a sepsis marker for bacterial infections. However, since presepsin is affected by renal function, there is a need to separate the evaluation criteria for diagnosis of healthy subjects from that of patients with renal disorder. In this study, we analyzed the influence of kidney function on presepsin concentrations and recalculated the reference range based on the findings. For this purpose, EDTA-whole blood from 47 healthy subjects and 85 patients with chronic kidney disease was collected and used for presepsin measurement by PATHFAST. Presepsin was found to be significantly correlated with creatinine (r = 0.834), eGFRcreat (r = 0.837), cystatin-C (r = 0.845) and eGFRcys (r = 0.879).\\n\\nFurthermore, in patients with chronic kidney disease at different glomerular filtration rate stages, the presepsin levels showed a significant increasing trend with advancing glomerular filtration rate stage. The reference range, calculated by nonparametric method using a total of 67 cases of healthy volunteers and patients with chronic kidney disease G1, was found to be 59-153 pg/mL, which was notably lower than the standard reference range currently used. Presepsin concentrations were positively correlated with some biomarkers of renal function, indicating that it is necessary to consider the influence of renal function in patients with renal impairment. Further, the recalculated reference range might be more useful for diagnosis and treatment of sepsis than the standard reference currently in use, which likely includes false high values.",

Using part of Greater Manchester (UK) as a case-study, we present a landscape approach to mapping green infrastructure and variation in social-ecological-environmental conditions as a function of land sparing and sharing. We do so for the landscape as a whole as well as for areas of high and low urbanity. Results imply potential trade-offs between land-sparing-sharing scenarios relevant to characteristics critical to urban resilience such as landscape connectivity and diversity, air quality, surface temperature, and access to green space. These trade-offs may be particularly complex due to the parallel influence of patch attributes such as land-cover and size and imply that both ecological restoration and spatial planning have a role to play in reconciling tensions between land-sparing and sharing strategies.",

    "abstract": "Identifying agricultural practices that enhance water cycling is critical, particularly with increased rainfall variability and greater risks of droughts and floods. Soil infiltration rates offer useful insights to water cycling in farming systems because they affect both yields (through soil water availability) and other ecosystem outcomes (such as pollution and flooding from runoff). For example, conventional agricultural practices that leave soils bare and vulnerable to degradation are believed to limit the capacity of soils to quickly absorb and retain water needed for crop growth. Further, it is widely assumed that farming methods such as no-till and cover crops can improve infiltration rates. Despite interest in the impacts of agricultural practices on infiltration rates, this effect has not been systematically quantified across a range of practices. To evaluate how conventional practices affect infiltration rates relative to select alternative practices (no-till, cover crops, crop rotation, introducing perennials, crop and livestock systems), we performed a meta-analysis that included 89 studies with field trials comparing at least one such alternative practice to conventional management. We found that introducing perennials (grasses, agroforestry, managed forestry) or cover crops led to the largest increases in infiltration rates (mean responses of 59.2 {+/-} 20.9% and 34.8 {+/-} 7.7%, respectively). Also, although the overall effect of no-till was non-significant (5.7 {+/-} 9.7%), the practice led to increases in wetter climates and when combined with residue retention. The effect of crop rotation on infiltration rate was non-significant (18.5 {+/-} 13.2%), and studies evaluating impacts of grazing on croplands indicated that this practice reduced infiltration rates (-21.3 {+/-} 14.9%). Findings suggest that practices promoting ground cover and continuous roots, both of which improve soil structure, were most effective at increasing infiltration rates.",

    "abstract": "Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) is an important member of the CDK family exerting its most important function in the regulation of the cell cycle. It catalyzes the transfer of the gamma phosphate group from an ATP (adenosine triphosphate) molecule to a Serine/Threonine residue of a peptide substrate. Due to the importance of this enzyme, and protein kinases in general, a detailed understanding of the reaction mechanism is desired. Thus, in this work the phosphoryl transfer reaction catalyzed by CDK2 was revisited and studied by means of hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations. Our results show that the base-assisted mechanism is preferred over the substrate-assisted pathway, in agreement with a previous theoretical study. The base-assisted mechanism resulted to be dissociative, with a potential energy barrier of 14.3 kcal/mol, very close to the experimental derived value. An interesting feature of the mechanism is the proton transfer from Lys129 to the phosphoryl group at the second transition state, event that could be helping in neutralizing the charge on the phosphoryl group upon the absence of a second Mg2+ ion. Furthermore, important insights into the mechanisms in terms of bond order and charge analysis were provided. These descriptors helped to characterize the synchronicity of bond forming and breaking events, and to characterize charge transfer effects. Local interactions at the active site are key to modulate the charge distribution on the phosphoryl group and therefore alter its reactivity.",

Bacteriological examination, region of difference (RD) 9 based polymerase chain reaction (PCR), single intradermal comparative tuberculin test (SIDCTT) and questionnaire were used for undertaking this study.\\n\\nResultsCulture positivity in farmers was 59.7% (111/186) and all the culture positive isolates were M. tuberculosis. About 68% (74/111) of culture positive respondents did not know about the transmission of TB from cattle to human or vice versa. The animal and herd prevalence of bovine TB were 1.5% (7/476) and 7.4% (7/95) respectively.

    "abstract": "The complete genome of a new rhabdovirus infecting papaya (Carica papaya L.) was sequenced and characterized. The genome consists of 13,469 nucleotides with six canonical open reading frames (ORFs) predicted from the antigenomic strand. In addition, two overlapping short ORFs were predicted between ORFs 3 and 4. Phylogenetic analyses using amino acid sequences from the nucleocapsid, glycoprotein and polymerase, grouped the virus with members of the genus Cytorhabdovirus, with rice stripe mosaic virus, yerba mate chlorosis-associated virus and Colocasia bobone disease-associated virus as closest relatives. The 3 leader and 5 trailer sequences were 144 and 167 nt long, respectively. Each end contains complementary sequences prone to form panhandle structures. The motif 3-AUUCUUUUUG-5, conserved across rhabdoviruses, was identified in all but one intergenic regions; whereas the motif 3-ACAAAAACACA-5 was found in three intergenic junctions. This is the first complete genome of a cytorhabdovirus infecting papaya. The virus was prevalent in commercial plantings of Los Rios, the most important papaya producing province of Ecuador. During the final stage of this manuscript preparation, the genome of a bean-associated cytorhabdovirus became available. Nucleotide identity (97%) between both genomes indicated that the two viruses are strains of the same species, for which we propose the name papaya cytorhabdovirus E.",

    "abstract": "The Tier 1 select agent Burkholderia pseudomallei is an environmental bacterium that causes melioidosis, a high mortality disease. Variably present genetic markers used to elucidate strain origin, relatedness and virulence in B. pseudomallei include the Burkholderia intracellular motility factor A (bimA) and filamentous hemagglutinin 3 (fhaB3) gene variants. Three lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O-antigen types in B. pseudomallei have been described, which vary in proportion between Australian and Asian isolates. However, it remains unknown if these LPS types can be used as genetic markers for geospatial analysis within a contiguous melioidosis-endemic region. Using a combination of whole-genome sequencing (WGS), statistical analysis and geographical mapping, we examined if the LPS types can be used as geographical markers in the Northern Territory, Australia. The clinical isolates revealed that LPS A prevalence was highest in the Darwin and surrounds (n = 660; 96% being LPS A and 4% LPS B) and LPS B in the Katherine and Katherine remote and East Arnhem regions (n = 79; 60% being LPS A and 40% LPS B). Bivariate logistics regression of 999 clinical B. pseudomallei isolates revealed that the odds of getting a clinical isolate with LPS B was highest in East Arnhem in comparison to Darwin and surrounds (OR 19.5, 95% CI 9.1 - 42.0; p<0.001). This geospatial correlation was subsequently confirmed by geographically mapping the LPS type from 340 environmental Top End strains. We also found that in the Top End, the minority bimA genotype bimABm has a similar remote region geographical footprint to that of LPS B. In addition, correlation of LPS type with multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) was strong, and where multiple LPS types were identified within a single sequence type, WGS confirmed homoplasy of the MLST loci. The clinical, sero-diagnostic and vaccine implications of geographically-based B. pseudomallei LPS types, and their relationships to regional and global dispersal of melioidosis, require global collaborations with further analysis of larger clinically and geospatially-linked datasets.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryBurkholderia pseudomallei is a pathogenic soil bacterium that causes the disease melioidosis, which occurs in many tropical regions globally and in recent years has emerged in non-tropical regions. Melioidosis has been predicted to affect 165,000 people every year resulting in an estimated 89,000 deaths. Person to person transmission is rare with most cases linked to exposure to the bacterium from the environment. The genetic background of B. pseudomallei has been well studied and variably present genes have been linked to distinct melioidosis disease states and geographic regions, however we still need a stronger understanding of the association of genes with geography. Three lipopolysaccharide types exist in B. pseudomallei and the prevalence of the lipopolysaccharide genes vary between melioidosis endemic regions, but it is unknown if the lipopolysaccharide genes can be used as geographical markers in a single melioidosis-endemic region. In this study, we used a combination of whole-genome sequencing, statistics and geographical mapping to elucidate if the three lipopolysaccharide genes can be used as geographical markers within the Northern Territory, Australia. We show that the three LPS types have distinct but overlapping geographical footprints within a single melioidosis region and can be used as geographic markers alongside a number of other important variably present B. pseudomallei genes.",

    "abstract": "Mouse models of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy recapitulate aspects of human epilepsy, which is characterized by neuronal network remodeling in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Observational studies suggest that this remodeling is associated with altered Wnt pathway signaling, although this has not been experimentally examined. We used the well-characterized mouse intrahippocampal kainate model of temporal lobe epilepsy to examine associations between post-seizure hippocampal neurogenesis and altered Wnt signaling. Tissue was analyzed using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy, and transcriptome analysis was performed on RNA extracted from anatomically micro-dissected dentate gyri. Seizures increased neurogenesis and dendritic arborization of newborn hippocampal dentate granule cells in peri-ictal regions, and decreased neurogenesis in the ictal zone, 2-weeks after kainate injection. Interestingly, administration of the novel canonical Wnt pathway inhibitor XAV939 daily for 2-weeks after kainate injection further increased dendritic arborization in peri-ictal regions after seizure, without an effect on baseline neurogenesis in control animals. Transcriptome analysis of dentate gyri demonstrated significant canonical Wnt gene dysregulation in kainate-injected mice across all regions for Wnt3, 5a and 9a. Intriguingly, certain Wnt genes demonstrated differential patterns of dysregulation between the ictal and peri-ictal zones, most notably Wnt5B, 7B and DKK-1. Together, these results demonstrate regional variation in Wnt pathway dysregulation in the early post-ictal period, and surprisingly, suggest that some Wnt-mediated effects might actually temper aberrant neurogenesis after seizures. The Wnt pathway may therefore provide suitable targets for novel therapies that prevent network remodeling and the development of epileptic foci in high-risk patients.",

    "abstract": "Some cancer cells lengthen their telomeres by alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT); these are referred to as ALT cancer cells and do not express telomerase. The ALT mechanism involves the elongation of telomeric DNA repeats by homologous recombination. In interphase nuclei of ALT cancer cells, giant telomeres can be specifically observed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to detect telomeric repeats, and they are co-localized with promyelocytic-leukemia nuclear-bodies (PML-NBs). However, it how large telomeres specific to ALT and how they form a structural relation with PML-NBs. We refer to giant telomeres specific to interphase ALT cancer cells giant-telomeric nuclear-bodies (GT-NBs). To quantitatively define GT-NBs, we performed telomeric FISH of both interphase nuclei and metaphase chromosomes and analyzed telomere sizes by integrated FISH signals. The distributions of telomere sizes in telomerase-positive cells were similar in interphase nuclei and chromosomes. However, the distribution of telomere sizes in ALT cancer cells differed between interphase nuclei and chromosomes. Giant telomeres that were larger than those at chromosomal ends were only observed in interphase nuclei of ALT cancer cells. Accordingly, GT-NBs could be quantitatively defined as larger than the maximum size of telomeres at chromosomal ends. Furthermore, ALT cancer cells demonstrated fewer telomeric signals in interphase nuclei than in chromosomes. These findings indicate that GT-NBs could be formed by the aggregation of two or more telomeres at chromosomal ends. Furthermore, super-resolution microscopy showed that GT-NBs contain one or two PML-NBs. GT-NBs are considered aggregates of telomeres and could contain multiple sites of homologous recombination accompanied by PML-NBs. These findings may contribute to the development of therapeutic approaches for ALT cancer. (251 words)",

    "abstract": "PurposeUsing optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) to characterize the types of collaterals in eyes with retinal vein occlusion (RVO) and further investigate their correlations with vessel densities of the superficial (SCP) and the deep capillary plexus (DCP).\\n\\nMethodsThis cross-sectional study included 25 eyes of 23 patients with RVO. 3 x 3 mm2 OCTA macular scans were used to quantify the parafoveal vessel density (VD) of the SCP and DCP, and to classify the collaterals into one of four types (true superficial, true deep, superficial diving, and foveal collateral). Poisson regression model was used to identify significant associations between parafoveal VD and collaterals. We further compared parafoveal VD between subgroups classified by the presence of specific collateral types based on the results of a clustering algorithm.\\n\\nResults16 of 25 eyes (64%) developed collaterals. Of the 43 collateral vessels analyzed, 12/19 (63%) true superficial collaterals developed in eyes with central RVO, while all 10 superficial diving collaterals (100%) developed in eyes with branch RVO. Located exclusively in the SCP, true superficial collaterals were all arteriovenous (A-V), while diving collaterals were all veno-venular (V-V). We found a significant negative correlation between SCP VD and the total number of collaterals (R2 = 0.648, P < 0.001) for the entire study cohort. Furthermore, BRVO eyes that developed superficial diving collaterals and CRVO eyes that developed true superficial collaterals demonstrated statistically significant decrease in SCP VD (P-value = 0.014) and DCP VD (P-value = 0.030), respectively, as compared to their counterparts.\\n\\nConclusionOur data shows that decreased capillary perfusion in RVO is associated with the development of collaterals, while the RVO type largely dictates the type of collateral that ultimately develops.",

    "abstract": "Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum (CLso) is an economically important plant-pathogen of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) crops in the United States, Mexico, Central America, and New Zealand. Currently, there are no reports of resistance to CLso in tomato cultivars. Identification and development of CLso-resistant cultivars may offer the most efficient way to manage this tomato disease. Resistance of 46 tomato landraces collected in different regions of Mexico, representing a wide range of genetic variability from this country was evaluated. Two assays were done in consecutively years to assess the resistance to CLso under greenhouse conditions. Plants from both tests were inoculated with CLso through 20 Bactericera cockerelli insects per plant. In the first trial, landraces FC22 and FC44 showed a significantly higher proportion of resistant plants, less symptoms severity, and longer incubation time, followed by landraces FC40 and FC33 compared with the rest of the 42 landraces and 2 susceptible cultivars 60 days post inoculation (dpi). In the second assay, only landraces FC22 and FC44 had again significantly higher proportion of resistant plants, less symptoms severity, relative lower CLso titers, and longer incubation time in comparison with landraces FC40 and FC33 and the two susceptible cultivars 60 dpi, corroborating their resistance to CLso. Presence of CLso DNA in all resistant plants from both assays discards scape plants and indicates that the methodology used was adequate to discriminate between resistant and susceptible plants. These results confirm that landraces FC22 and FC44 are promising resistant sources for the development of CLso-resistant cultivars of tomato.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe bacterium \\\"Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum\\\" (CLso) is an important plant-pathogen of tomato crops in the United States, Mexico, Central America, and New Zealand. Tomato growers are lacking of cultivars with resistance to this pathogen and the development of resistant cultivars of this crop would make a sustainable business for these growers and healthy tomato consumption for humans. Tomato landraces from countries that are center of domestication of cultivated crops like Mexico, are potentially sources of resistance to plant-pathogens. Therefore, two tests were done looking for resistance sources to this pathogen and we found two tomato landraces (FC22 and FC44) showing high level of resistance to CLso because they had significantly higher resistant plants, less symptoms severity, lower CLso DNA concentration, and delay of the first symptoms in the inoculated plants in comparison with the two commercial cultivars and 44 tomato landraces collected from Mexico 60 days post infection. These landraces are promising resistant sources for the development of CLso-resistant cultivars of tomato.",

Additionally, the roles of positive and negative perfectionism in workaholism were investigated. The sample consisted of 686 employees. All of them completed the study instruments. The results showed that the mean of workaholism, positive perfectionism, and negative perfectionism were respectively 2.60, 4.04, and 3.53. Additionally, multivariate tests showed that the results of post hoc differences for positive perfectionism were in favor of males, subordinates, those with a bachelors degree, those with less than 5 years of experience, and those aged less than 30 years. Furthermore, the differences for negative perfectionism were in favor of those with a bachelors degree and subordinates. For workaholism, the differences were in favor of subordinates, public sector employees, married persons, and those with a diploma degree. Finally, the results of hierarchical regression analysis found that positive and negative perfectionism and some demographic variables predicted 129% of the variability in workaholism, and the typical hierarchical regression model included positive and negative perfectionism without other demographic variables.",

    "abstract": "We are in the midst of unprecedented change--climate shifts and sustained, widespread habitat degradation have led to dramatic declines in biodiversity rivaling historical extinction events. At the same time, new approaches to publishing and integrating previously disconnected data resources promise to help provide the evidence needed for more efficient and effective conservation and management. Stakeholders have invested considerable resources to contribute to online databases of species occurrences and genetic barcodes. However, estimates suggest that only 10% of biocollections are available in digital form. The biocollections community must therefore continue to promote digitization efforts, which in part requires demonstrating compelling applications of the data. Our overarching goal is therefore to determine trends in use of mobilized species occurrence data since 2010, as online systems have grown and now provide over one billion records. To do this, we characterized 501 papers that use openly accessible biodiversity databases. Our standardized tagging protocol was based on key topics of interest, including: database(s) used, taxa addressed, general uses of data, other data types linked to species occurrence data, and data quality issues addressed. We found that the most common uses of online biodiversity databases have been to estimate species distribution and richness, to outline data compilation and publication, and to assist in developing species checklists or describing new species. Only 69% of papers in our dataset addressed one or more aspects of data quality, which is low considering common errors and biases known to exist in opportunistic datasets. Globally, we find that biodiversity databases are still in the initial stages of data compilation. Novel and integrative applications are restricted to certain taxonomic groups and regions with higher numbers of quality records. Continued data digitization, publication, enhancement, and quality control efforts are necessary to make biodiversity science more efficient and relevant in our fast-changing world.",

    "abstract": "Co-infection between HIV-1 and HCV is common today in certain populations. However, treatment of co-infection is full of challenges with special consideration for potential hepatic safety and drug-drug interactions. Multitarget inhibitors with less toxicity may provide a promising therapeutic strategy for HIV/HCV co-infection. However, identification of one molecule acting on multiple targets simultaneously by experimental evaluation is costly and time-consuming. In silico target prediction tools provide more opportunities for the development of multitarget inhibitors. In this study, by combining naive Bayesian (NB) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms with two types of molecular fingerprints (MACCS and ECFP6), 60 classification models were constructed to predict the active compounds toward 11 HIV-1 targets and 4 HCV targets based on the multitarget-quantitative structure-activity relationships (mt-QSAR). 5-fold cross-validation and test set validation was performed to confirm the performance of 60 classification models. Our results show that 60 mt-QSAR models appeared to have high classification accuracy in terms of ROC-AUC values ranging from 0.83 to 1 with a mean value of 0.97 for HIV-1 models, and ROC-AUC values ranging from 0.84 to 1 with a mean value of 0.96 for HCV. Furthermore, the 60 models were applied to comprehensively predict the potential targets for additional 46 compounds including 27 approved HIV-1 drugs, 10 approved HCV drugs and 9 selected compounds known to be active on one or more targets of HIV-1 or those of HCV. Finally, 18 hits including 7 HIV-1 approved drugs, 4 HCV approved drugs and 7 compounds were predicted to be HIV/HCV co-infection multitarget inhibitors. The reported bioactivity data confirmed that 7 compounds actually interacted with HIV-1 and HCV targets simultaneously with diverse binding affinities. Of those remaining predicted hits and chemical-protein interaction pairs involving the potential ability to suppress HIV/HCV co-infection deserve further investigation by experiments. This investigation shows that the mt-QSAR method is available to predict chemical-protein interaction for discovering multitarget inhibitors and provide a unique perspective on HIV/HCV co-infection treatment.",

However, the explicit effect of particle size on the rumen microbiota remains untested, despite their crucial role in digestion. We evaluated the effects of reduced particle size on rumen microbiota by feeding long-stem (loose) alfalfa hay compared to a ground and pelleted version of the same alfalfa in yearling sheep wethers. In situ digestibility of the pelleted diet was greater at 48 h compared with loose hay; however, distribution of residual fecal particle sizes in sheep did not differ between the dietary treatments at any time point. Both average daily gain and feed efficiency were greater for the wethers consuming the pelleted diet. Observed bacterial richness was very low at the end of the adaptation period and increased over the course of the study, suggesting the rumen bacterial community was still in flux after two weeks of adaptation. The pelleted-hay diet group had a greater increase in bacterial richness, including common fibrolytic rumen inhabitants. The pelleted diet was positively associated with several Succiniclasticum, a Prevotella, and uncultured taxa in the Ruminococcaceae and Rickenellaceae families and Bacteroidales order. Pelleting an alfalfa hay diet for sheep does shift the rumen microbiome, though the interplay of diet particle size, retention and GI transit time, microbial fermentative and hydrolytic activity, and host growth or health is still largely unexplored.",

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common genetic disorders in the Caucasian population. The disease has a progressive course and leads to reduced life quality and life expectancy. Standard diagnostic procedures used in the monitoring of CF patients, include methods exposing patients to the ionizing radiation. With increasing life expectancy in CF the cumulative dose of ionising radiation increases, prompting clinicians search for safer imaging studies. Despite its safety and availability lung ultrasound (LUS) is not routinely used in the diagnostic evaluation of CF patients.\\n\\nThe aim of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of LUS in children with CF compared to chest X-ray, and to assess the diagnostic value of the recently developed LUS score - CF-USS (Cystic Fibrosis Ultrasound Score).\\n\\nLUS was performed in 48 CF children aged from 5 to 18 years (24 girls and 24 boys). LUS consisted in the assessment of the pleura, lung sliding, A-line and B-line artifacts, \\\"lung rockets\\\", alveolar consolidations, air bronchogram and pleural effusion. Chest radiography was performed in all patients and analyzed according to the modified Chrispin-Norman score. LUS was analyzed according to CF-USS.\\n\\nCorrelation between the CF-USS and the modified Chrispin-Norman scores were moderate (R=0.52, p=0.0002) and strong in control studies. In 75% of patients undergoing LUS, small areas of subpleural consolidations were observed, not visible on X-rays. At the same time, LUS was not sensitive enough to visualize bronchial pathology, which plays an important role in assessing the disease progression.\\n\\nConclusionsLUS constitutes an invaluable tool for the diagnosis of subpleural consolidations. CF-USS results correlate with conventional x-ray modified Chrispin-Norman score. LUS should be considered an accessory radiographic examination in the monitoring of CF patients, and CF-USS may provide clinicians with valuable information concerning the disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular calcium (Ca2+) cycling dynamics in cardiac myocytes are spatiotemporally generated by stochastic events arising from a spatially distributed network of coupled Ca2+ release units (CRUs) that interact with an intertwined mitochondrial network. In this study, we developed a spatiotemporal ventricular myocyte model that integrates mitochondria-related Ca2+ cycling components into our previously developed ventricular myocyte model consisting of a 3-dimensional CRU network. Mathematical formulations of mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial Ca2+ cycling, mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) stochastic opening and closing, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling, and oxidized Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) signaling were incorporated into the model. We then used the model to simulate the effects of mitochondrial depolarization on mitochondrial Ca2+ cycling, Ca2+ spark frequency and amplitude, which agree well with experimental data. We also simulated the effects of the strength of mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporters and their spatial localization on intracellular Ca2+ cycling properties, which substantially affected diastolic and systolic Ca2+ levels in the mitochondria but exhibited only a small effect on sarcoplasmic reticulum and cytosolic Ca2+ levels under normal conditions. We show that mitochondrial depolarization can cause Ca2+ waves and Ca2+ alternans, which agrees with previous experimental observations. We propose that this new spatiotemporal ventricular myocyte model, incorporating properties of mitochondrial Ca2+ cycling and ROS-dependent signaling, will be useful for investigating the effects of mitochondria on intracellular Ca2+ cycling and action potential dynamics in ventricular myocytes.",

    "abstract": "Adolescent changes in human brain function are not entirely understood. Here we used multi-echo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure developmental change in functional connectivity (FC) of resting-state oscillations between pairs of 330 cortical regions and 16 subcortical regions in N=298 healthy adolescents. Participants were aged 14-26 years and were scanned on two or more occasions at least 6 months apart. We found two distinct modes of age-related change in FC: \\\"conservative\\\" and \\\"disruptive\\\". Conservative development was characteristic of primary cortex, which was strongly connected at 14 years and became even more connected in the period 14-26 years. Disruptive development was characteristic of association cortex, hippocampus and amygdala, which were not strongly connected at 14 years but became more strongly connected during adolescence. We defined the maturational index (MI) as the signed coefficient of the linear relationship between baseline FC (at 14 years, FC14) and adolescent change in FC ({triangleup}FC14-26). Disruptive systems (with negative MI) were functionally specialised for social cognition and autobiographical memory and were significantly co-located with prior maps of aerobic glycolysis (AG), AG-related gene expression, post-natal expansion of cortical surface area, and adolescent shrinkage of cortical depth. We conclude that human brain organization is disrupted during adolescence by the emergence of strong functional connectivity of subcortical nuclei and association cortical areas, representing metabolically expensive re-modelling of synaptic connectivity between brain regions that were not strongly connected in childhood. We suggest that this re-modelling process may support emergence of social skills and self-awareness during healthy human adolescence.",

    "abstract": "In the 1980s, plant scientists descended on a small weed Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress) and developed it into a powerful model system to study plant biology. The massive advances in genetics and genomics since then has allowed us to obtain incredibly detailed knowledge on specific biological processes of Arabidopsis growth and development, its genome sequence and the function of many of the individual genes. This wealth of information provides immense potential for translation into crops to improve their performance and address issues of global importance such as food security. Here we describe how fundamental insight into the genetic mechanism by which seed dispersal occurs in members of the Brassicaceae family can be exploited to reduce seed loss in oilseed rape (Brassica napus). We demonstrate that by exploiting data on gene function in model species, it is possible to adjust the pod-opening process in oilseed rape thereby significantly increasing yield. Specifically, we identified mutations in multiple paralogues of the INDEHISCENT and GA4 genes in B. napus and have overcome genetic redundancy by combining mutant alleles. Finally, we present novel software for the analysis of pod shatter data that is applicable to any crop for which seed dispersal is a serious problem. These findings highlight the tremendous potential of fundamental research in guiding strategies for crop improvement.\\n\\nKeymessageElucidation of key regulators in Arabidopsis fruit patterning has facilitated knowledge-translation into crop species to address yield loss caused by premature seed dispersal (pod shatter).",

    "abstract": "Green leafy vegetables (GLVs) comprise a significant part of urban South-East Asian (SEA) diets and are intensively farmed in SEA cities, including Singapore. Urban farming practices and urban-adapted vegetable cultivars likely select for specific above- and below-ground microbial communities - microbiomes - that assemble in close proximity to the plant tissues - the exosphere. A healthy exosphere microbiome is important for plant growth and safe human consumption. Using 16S rDNA gene amplicon sequencing compositional analyses, we show here that the exosphere microbiome of two commonly-consumed GLVs - Choy Sum (Brassica oleracea Alboglabra Group) and Gai Lan (Brassica chinensis var. parachinensis) - dominated by Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Bacteroidia and Actinobacteria. Shifts in exosphere microbiome composition were strongly associated with plant developmental stage. Finally, microbial taxa consistently detected in the exosphere comprise a small subset, which are predicted to harbour plant-beneficial traits.\\n\\nSignificanceAmong plant crops, GLVs form an integral part of the Asian diet, especially so in Southeast Asia. Some of these GLVs have short life-cycles ({bsim}30-45 days), which makes them suitable for urban farms in terms of cost advantage as short cycle crops are preferred in urban farms. From a food-security perspective, GLVs forms an important target food group and efforts are being made to increase its productivity to meet the increasing food demands. Current farming practices often place lot of importance on chemical fertilizers and nutrient inputs to improve the fertility of non-arable urban lands to increase the crop productivity. Furthermore, farms in urban settings are also associated with anthropogenic inputs and eutrophic conditions. These together, contribute to negative environmental externalities questioning the sustainability and eco-sustenance of urban farming. Microbial based management systems can not only resolve these challenging issues, but can also enhance plant growth, nutrient use efficiency and disease tolerance. However, their use as microbial adjuncts to agricultural practices is currently limited in urban environments, which could possibly be due to the restricted knowledge-base on these urban phytobiomes.",

    "abstract": "During meiosis, formation of double-strand breaks (DSBs) and repair by homologous recombination between homologs creates crossovers (COs) that facilitate chromosome segregation. CO formation is tightly regulated to ensure the integrity of this process. The DNA damage response kinases, Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and RAD3-related (ATR) have emerged as key regulators of CO formation in yeast, flies, and mice, influencing DSB formation, repair pathway choice, and cell cycle progression. The molecular networks that ATM and ATR influence during meiosis are still being resolved in other organisms. Here we show that Caenorhabditis elegans ATM and ATR homologs, ATM-1 and ATL-1 respectively, act at multiple steps in CO formation to ultimately ensure that COs are formed on all chromosomes. We show a role for ATM-1 in regulating the choice of repair template, biasing use of the homologous chromosome instead of the sister chromatid. Our data suggests a model in which ATM-1 and ATL-1 have antagonistic roles in very early repair processing, but are redundantly required for accumulation of the RAD-51 recombinase at DSB sites. We propose that these features of ATM-1 and ATL-1 ensure both CO formation on all chromosomes and accurate repair of additional DSBs.\\n\\nArticle SummaryCrossovers formed during meiosis connect homologs and properly align them for cell division. The central importance of crossovers is underscored by the existence of extensive regulatory processes that ensures the proper execution of these events. This paper explores the evolutionary conserved roles of the central DNA damage response kinases, ATM and ATR, in crossover formation. The authors show that these kinases function together as rheostats to promote timely formation of crossovers on all chromosomes but to limit extensive DNA damage. This work provides a platform for identifying conserved meiotic targets of ATM and ATR that affect fertility across species.",

    "abstract": "Two recent papers, and an author response to prior commentary, addressing the genetic architecture of human temperament and character claimed that \\\"The identified SNPs explained nearly all the heritability expected\\\". The authors method for estimating heritability may be summarized as: Step 1: Pre-select SNPs on the basis of GWAS p<0.01 in the target sample. Step 2: Enter target sample genotypes (the pre-selected SNPs from Step 1) and phenotypes into an unsupervised machine learning algorithm (Phenotype-Genotype Many-to-Many Relations Analysis, PGMRA) for further reduction of the set of SNPs. Step 3: Test the sum score of the SNPs identified from Step 2, weighted by the GWAS regression weights estimated in Step 1, within the same target sample. The authors interpreted the linear regression model R2 obtained from Step 3 as a measure of successfully identified heritability. Regardless of the method applied to select SNPs in Step 2, the combination of Steps 1 and 3, as described, causes inflation of the estimated effect size. The extent of this inflation is demonstrated here, where random SNP selection and polygenic scoring from simulated random data recovered effect sizes similar to those reported in the original empirical papers.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic currents represent a major contribution to the local field potential (LFP) in brain tissue, but the respective contribution of excitatory and inhibitory synapses is not known. Here, we provide estimates of this contribution by using computational models of hippocampal pyramidal neurons, constrained by in vitro recordings. We focus on the unitary LFP (uLFP) generated by single neurons in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. We first reproduce experimental results for hippocampal basket cells, and in particular how inhibitory uLFP are distributed within hippocampal layers. Next, we calculate the uLFP generated by pyramidal neurons, using morphologically-reconstructed CA3 pyramidal cells. The model shows that the excitatory uLFP is of small amplitude, smaller than inhibitory uLFPs. Indeed, when the two are simulated together, inhibitory uLFPs mask excitatory uLFPs, which might create the illusion that the inhibitory field is generated by pyramidal cells. These results provide an explanation for the observation that excitatory and inhibitory uLFPs are of the same polarity, in vivo and in vitro. These results also show that somatic inhibitory currents are large contributors of the LFP, which is important information to interpret this signal. Finally, the results of our model might form the basis of a simple method to compute the LFP, which could be applied to point neurons for each cell type, thus providing a simple biologically-grounded method to calculate LFPs from neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Species are central to ecology and conservation. However, it is the interactions between species that generate the functions on which ecosystems and humans depend. Despite the importance of interactions, we lack an understanding of the risk that their loss poses to ecological communities. Here, we quantify risk as a function of the vulnerability (likelihood of loss) and importance (contribution to network stability in terms of species coexistence) of 4330 mutualistic interactions from 41 empirical pollination and seed dispersal networks across six continents. Remarkably, we find that more vulnerable interactions are also more important: the interactions that contribute most to network stability are those that are most likely to be lost. Furthermore, most interactions tend to have more similar vulnerability and importance across networks than expected by chance, suggesting that vulnerability and importance may be intrinsic properties of interactions, rather than only a function of ecological context. These results provide a starting point for prioritising interactions for conservation in species interaction networks and, in areas lacking network data, could allow interaction properties to be inferred from taxonomy alone.",

Numerous behavioral studies investigating homing indicate that many animals maintain an online representation of the direction of the home, a home vector. Here we placed the rats home cage in the arena, while recording neurons in the animals parasubiculum and medial entorhinal cortex. From a pellet hoarding paradigm it became evident that the home cage induced locomotion patterns characteristic of homing behaviors. We did not observe home-vector cells. We found that head-direction signals were unaffected by home location. However, grid cells were distorted in the presence of the home cage. While they did not globally remap, single firing fields were translocated towards the home. These effects appeared to be geometrical in nature rather than a home-specific distortion. Our work suggests that medial entorhinal cortex and parasubiculum do not contain an explicit neural representation of the home direction.",

    "abstract": "Over-consumption of high-fat diets (HFDs) is associated with several pathologies. Although the intestine is the organ that comes into direct contact with all diet components, the impact of HFD has mostly been studied in organs that are linked to obesity and obesity related disorders. We used Drosophila as a simple model to disentangle the effects of a HFD on the intestinal structure and physiology from the plethora of other effects caused by this nutritional intervention. Here, we show that a HFD triggers activation of intestinal stem cells in the Drosophila midgut. This stem cell activation was transient and preceded by induction of JNK signaling in enterocytes. JNK (basket) within enterocytes was essential for activation of stem cells in response to a HFD. Moreover, this nutritional intervention leads to upregulation of the cytokine upd3 in enterocytes, a reaction that is known to trigger STAT signaling in intestinal stem cells followed by their activation. We also showed that the indigenous microbiota was essential for HFD-induced stem cell activation because this response was blunted in germ-free flies lacking a microbiota. Moreover, chronic HFD feeding of flies markedly altered both the microbiota composition and bacterial load. Although HFD-induced stem cell activity was transient, long-lasting changes to the cellular composition, including a substantial increase in the number of enteroendocrine cells, were observed. Taken together, a HFD enhances stem cell activity in the Drosophila gut and this effect is completely reliant on the indigenous microbiota and also dependent on JNK signaling within intestinal enterocytes.\\n\\nAuthor summaryHigh-fat diets have been associated with a plethora of morbidities. The major research focus has been on its effects on obesity related disorders, mostly omitting the intestine, although it is the organ that makes the first contact with all diet components. Here, we aimed to understand the direct effects of HFD on the intestine itself. Using Drosophila as a model, we showed that HFD induced a transient activation of intestinal stem cells. This response completely depended on JNK signaling in enterocytes. Mechanistically, we found that HFD induces JNK signaling in enterocytes, which triggers production of the cytokine upd3. This, in turn activates STAT signaling in intestinal stem cells, leading to their activation. Surprisingly, we found that a HFD triggered induced stem cell activation critically depends on the indigenous microbiota, as in germ free flies this reaction was completely abolished. Moreover, HFD changed both, composition and abundance of the microbiota. As fecal transfer experiments failed to recapitulate the HFD phenotype, we assume that the increased bacterial load is the major cause for the HFD triggered stem cell activation in the intestine.",

    "abstract": "Understanding inter-specific variation in social systems is a major goal of behavioural ecology. Previous comparative studies of mammalian social organisation produced inconsistent results, possibly because they ignored intra-specific variation in social organisation (IVSO). The Artiodactyla have been the focus of many comparative studies as they occupy a wide diversity of habitats and exhibit large variation in life history patterns as well as other potential correlates of social organisation. Here we present the first systematic data on IVSO among Artiodactyla, infer their ancestral social organisation, and test whether habitat, sexual dimorphism, seasonal breeding, and body size predict inter- and intraspecific variation in social organisation. We found data on social organisation for 110 of 226 artiodactyl species, of which 74.5% showed IVSO. Using Bayesian phylogenetic multilevel models, the ancestral artiodactyl population was predicted to have a variable social organisation with significantly higher probability (0.77, 95% CI 0.29-1.00) than any non-variable form (i.e. solitary, pair-living, group-living). Greater sexual dimorphism and smaller body size both predicted more IVSO; smaller body size also predicted a higher likelihood of pair-living. Our results challenge the long-held assumption that ancestral Artiodactyla were pair-living and strongly imply that taking IVSO into account is crucial for understanding mammalian social evolution.",

Genome sequence analysis identified the putative pentamycin biosynthetic gene cluster, which shows a high degree of similarity to the gene cluster responsible for filipin III biosynthesis. The ptnJ gene, which is absent from the filipin III biosynthetic gene cluster, was shown to encode a cytochrome P450 capable of converting filipin III to pentamycin. This confirms that the cluster directs pentamycin biosynthesis, paving the way for biosynthetic engineering approaches to the production of pentamycin analogues. Several other Streptomyces genomes were found to contain ptnJ orthologues clustered with genes encoding polyketide synthases that appear to have similar architectures to those responsible for the assembly of filipin III and pentamycin, suggesting pentamycin production may be common in Streptomyces species.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecological malignancy in women, and it is likely to metastasize and has a poor prognosis. The early and reliable diagnosis and monitoring of ovarian cancer is very important. Without a homeostasis mechanism, urine can reflect early systemic changes in the body and has a great potential to be used for the early detection of cancer. This study tested whether early changes could be detected in two ovarian cancer rat models. Two rat models were established by either intraperitoneal (i.p.) or orthotopic (o.t.) injection of NuTu-19 ovarian cancer cells in female Fischer344 rats. Urine samples from ovarian cancer rats were collected at five time points during cancer development, and urinary proteins from the rats were profiled by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Compared with pre-injection samples, 49 differential proteins that have human orthologues were significantly changed in the orthotopically injected model. Among them, 24 of the differential proteins have previously been reported to be associated with ovarian cancer, six of which were reported to be biomarkers of ovarian cancer. On the 7th day after orthotopic injection, four differential proteins (APOA1, OX2G, CHMP5, HEXB) were identified before obvious metastases appeared. In the intraperitoneal injection model, 76 differential proteins were changed during the course of ovarian cancer development. The results show that urine proteins could enable the early detection and monitoring of ovarian cancer progression and could lay a foundation for further exploration of the biomarkers of ovarian cancer.",

Well-known PRFU such as lambda-Red or Rac RecET has been proved to be useful tool in the recombineering of Escherichia coli but had limited efficiency in distant species. Therefore, PRFUs from closely related species were often searched and developed as specific genetic tools. However, there are still many bacteria with few PRFU identified. Here, we hypothesised that the occurrence of PRFU might be related to specific strains. Based on this assumption, we managed to identify 59 unique sets of PRFUs in over 23 species of the genus Corynebacterium, a taxonomic group that were reported to be lacking in such system. The identified PRFUs were then classified to show their similarities and relation to species based on both sequential and structural information. Representative PRFUs were verified to be highly effective in mediating recombineering using ssDNA or dsDNA substrates. Analysis of the functional PRFUs indicated that they share similar local genome contexts, which might suggest their common origin. Our findings reveal the relation of PRFUs, species and strains and provide novel candidate genetic manipulation tools in genus Corynebacterium.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryGenus Corynebacterium is a taxonomic group with highly diversified species that are of medical, veterinary, or biotechnological relevance. However, being lack of genetic tools limits the study of these species. Our new verified phage recombinase function units (PRFUs) in this genus that are highly effective in mediating recombineering will provide new candidate genetic tools in this genus. Besides, reference genomes were often used for genome study and data mining. While for the mobile genetic elements, their transferable characteristic may affect their occurrence among genomes. Here we provide evidence for this idea by showing that the occurrence of PRFU is strain related but not species related.

    "abstract": "Piezo1 is a mechanosensitive cation channel with widespread physiological importance; however its role in the heart is poorly understood. Cardiac fibroblasts are responsible for preserving the structural integrity of the myocardium and play a key role in regulating its repair and remodeling following stress or injury. We investigated expression and function of Piezo1 in cultured human and mouse cardiac fibroblasts. RT-PCR studies confirmed expression of Piezo1 mRNA in cardiac fibroblasts at similar levels to endothelial cells. Fura-2 intracellular Ca2+ measurements validated Piezo1 as a functional ion channel that was activated by the Piezo1 agonist, Yoda1. Yoda1-induced Ca2+ entry was inhibited by Piezo1 blockers (gadolinium, ruthenium red) and the Ca2+ response was reduced proportionally by Piezo1 siRNA knockdown or in cells from Piezo1+/- mice. Investigation of Yoda1 effects on selected remodeling genes indicated that Piezo1 activation opposed cardiac fibroblast differentiation; data confirmed by functional collagen gel contraction assays. Piezo1 activation using Yoda1 or mechanical stretch also increased the expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a mechanosensitive pro-hypertrophic and pro-fibrotic cytokine, in a Piezo1-dependent manner. Multiplex kinase activity profiling combined with kinase inhibitor studies and phospho-specific western blotting, established that Piezo1 activation stimulated IL-6 secretion via a pathway involving p38 MAP kinase, downstream of Ca2+ entry. In summary, this study reveals that cardiac fibroblasts express functional Piezo1 channels coupled to reduced myofibroblast activation and increased secretion of paracrine signaling molecules that can modulate cardiac remodeling.",

Here, we replicate this earlier work and also investigate the neurophysiological correlates of decision-making using EEG.\\n\\nIn a two interval forced choice task, co-actors individually indicated presence of a target stimulus with a higher contrast and then indicated their confidence on a rating scale.

At stimulus onset, ERPs were significantly linearly related to our manipulation of contrast differences, validating our manipulation of task difficulty. For individual and joint responses, we found a significant centro-parietal error-related positivity for correct versus incorrect responses, which suggests that accuracy is already evaluated at the response level. At feedback presentation, we found a significant late positive fronto-central potential elicited by incorrect joint responses, suggesting a stronger emotional response to negative as compared to positive feedback. In sum, these results demonstrate that response- and feedback-related components elicited by an error-monitoring system differentially integrate conflicting information exchanged during the joint decision-making process.",

PCC 7002 (Syn7002), are promising chassis strains for \\\"green\\\" biotechnological applications as they can be grown in seawater using oxygenic photosynthesis to fix carbon dioxide into biomass. Their other major nutritional requirements for efficient growth are sources of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). As these organisms are more economically cultivated in outdoor open systems, there is a need to develop cost-effective approaches to prevent the growth of contaminating organisms, especially as the use of antibiotic selection markers is neither economically feasible nor ecologically desirable due to the risk of horizontal gene transfer. Here we have introduced a synthetic melamine degradation pathway into Syn7002 and evolved the resulting strain to efficiently use the nitrogen-rich xenobiotic compound melamine as the sole N source. We also show that expression of phosphite dehydrogenase in the absence of its cognate phosphite transporter permits growth of Syn7002 on phosphite and can be used as a selectable marker in Syn7002. We combined these two strategies to generate a strain that can grow on melamine and phosphite as sole N and P sources, respectively. This strain is able to resist deliberate contamination in large excess and should be a useful chassis for metabolic engineering and biotechnological applications using cyanobacteria.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundResearchers commonly use online tools such as ToppGene to conduct enrichment analyses on gene expression data. This process does not easily allow multiple gene data sets to be analyzed and compared at once. ToppGene requires the user to manually enter gene symbols or other gene identifiers into a text box and to manually sift through forms with many adjustable parameters in order to obtain a downloadable text file of results. This process makes the analysis of multiple sets of genes tedious, time-consuming, and error prone. To address this problem, we developed Malachite, a Python package that enables researchers to perform gene enrichment analyses on multiple gene lists and concatenate the resulting enrichment statistics. In this way, Malachite enables meta-enrichment analyses across multiple data sets.\\n\\nResultsTo illustrate its use, we applied Malachite to three data sets from the Gene Expression Omnibus comparing gene expression in the large airways of smokers and non-smokers. Biological processes enriched in all three data sets were related to xenobiotic stimulus; molecular functions typically involved nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) activity.\\n\\nConclusionMalachite enables researchers to automate gene enrichment metaanalyses using ToppGene. Malachite also enhances ToppGenes gene set analysis of drug-gene relationships by further filtering for FDA approved drugs.",

    "abstract": "Efficient motility requires polarised cells, with anterior pseudopods and a retracting rear. This polarisation requires that the pseudopod catalyst Rac is restricted to the front. Here we show that the Arp2/3 complex regulator WASP is important for maintaining front-rear polarity, using a mechanism that limits where active Rac localises. Dictyostelium cells lacking WASP inappropriately activate Rac and SCAR/WAVE at their rears, leading to reduced cell speed. WASP facilitates the internalisation of clathrin-coated pits, and its Rac-binding CRIB motif is considered essential for its localisation and activity. However, WASP mutants with deleted CRIB domains, or harbouring a new mutation that prevents Rac binding, localise normally, recruit Arp2/3 complex, and drive actin polymerisation. Similarly, Rac inhibitors do not block WASP localisation or activation. Despite this, WASP CRIB mutants cannot restore polarisation of active Rac. Thus, WASPs interaction with Rac regulates Rac activity and cell polarity, but is dispensable for activating actin polymerization.",

    "abstract": "Insecticide-treated bed nets reduce malaria transmission by limiting contact between mosquito vectors and human hosts when mosquitoes feed during the night. However, malaria vectors can also feed in the early evening and in the morning when people are not protected. Here, we explored how timing of blood feeding interacts with environmental temperature to influence the capacity of Anopheles mosquitoes to transmit the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. We found no effect of biting time itself on the proportion of mosquitoes that became infectious (vector competence) at constant temperature. However, when mosquitoes were maintained under more realistic fluctuating temperatures there was a significant increase in competence for mosquitoes feeding in the evening, and a significant reduction in competence for those feeding in the morning, relative to those feeding at midnight. These effects appear to be due to thermal sensitivity of malaria parasites during the initial stages of parasite development within the mosquito, and the fact that mosquitoes feeding in the evening experience cooling temperatures during the night, whereas mosquitoes feeding in the morning quickly experience warming temperatures that are inhibitory to parasite establishment. A transmission dynamics model illustrates that such differences in competence could have important implications for disease endemicity, the extent of transmission that persists in the presence of bed nets, and the epidemiological impact of behavioural resistance. These results indicate the interaction of temperature and feeding behaviour to be a major ecological determinant of the vectorial capacity of malaria mosquitoes.",

As multiple large-scale screens become available, a formal assessment of the reproducibility of these experiments becomes necessary. We analyzed data from recently published pan-cancer CRISPR-Cas9 screens performed at the Broad and Sanger institutes. Despite significant differences in experimental protocols and reagents, we found that the screen results are highly concordant across multiple metrics with both common and specific dependencies jointly identified across the two studies. Furthermore, robust biomarkers of gene dependency found in one dataset are recovered in the other. Through further analysis and replication experiments at each institute, we found that batch effects are driven principally by two key experimental parameters: the reagent library and the assay length. These results indicate that the Broad and Sanger CRISPR-Cas9 viability screens yield robust and reproducible findings.",

    "abstract": "While the mechanism of CRISPR/Cas9 cleavage is understood, the large variation in mutant recovery for a given target sequence between cell lines is much less clear. We hypothesized that this variation may be due to differences in how the DNA damage response affects cell cycle progression. We used incorporation of EdU as a marker of cell cycle progression to analyze the response of several human cell lines to CRISPR/Cas9 treatment with a single guide directed to a unique locus. Cell lines with functionally wild-type TP53 exhibited higher levels of cell cycle arrest compared to lines without. Chemical inhibition of TP53 protein combined with TP53 and RB1 transcript silencing alleviated induced arrest in TP53+/+ cells. This arrest is driven in part by Cas9 binding to DNA. Additionally, wild-type Cas9 induced fewer 53BP1 foci in TP53+/+ cells compared to TP53-/- cells, suggesting that differences in break sensing are responsible for cell cycle arrest variation. We conclude that CRISPR/Cas9 treatment induces a cell cycle arrest dependent on functional TP53 as well as Cas9 DNA binding and cleavage. Our findings suggest that transient inhibition of TP53 may increase genome editing efficiency in primary and TP53+/+ cell lines.",

    "abstract": "Central to the study of joint inheritance of quantitative traits is the determination of the degree of association between two phenotypic characters, and to quantify the relative contribution of shared genetic and environmental components influencing such relationship. One way to approach this problem builds on classical quantitative genetics theory, where the phenotypic correlation [Formula] between two traits is modelled as the sum of a genetic component called the coheritability (hx,y), which reflects the degree of shared genetics influencing the phenotypic correlation, and an environmental component, namely the coenvironmentability (ex,y) that accounts for all other factors that exert influence on the observed trait-trait association. Here a mathematical and statistical framework is presented on the partition of the phenotypic correlation into these components. I describe visualization tools to analyze [Formula] and ex,y concurrently, in the form of a three-dimensional (3DHER-plane) and a two-dimensional (2DHER-field) plots. A large data set of genetic parameter estimates (heritabilities, genetic and phenotypic correlations) was compiled from an extensive literature review, from which coheritability and coenvironmentability were derived, with the object to observe patterns of distribution, and tendency. Illustrative examples from a diverse set of published studies show the value of applying this partition to generate hypotheses proposing the differential contribution of shared genetics and shared environment to an observed phenotypic relationship between traits.",

TR diversifies the proteome and can modulate protein levels 1-6. Here we report that AGO1x, a conserved TR isoform of Argonaute 1, is generated in highly proliferative breast cancer cells, where it curbs accumulation of double stranded RNAs, the induction of the interferon response and apoptosis. In contrast to other mammalian Argonaute protein family members with primarily cytoplasmic functions, AGO1x localizes to the nucleus, in the vicinity of nucleoli. We identify a novel interaction of AGO1x with the Polyribonucleotide Nucleotidyltransferase 1, depletion of either protein leading to dsRNA accumulation and impaired cell proliferation. Our study thus uncovers a novel function of an Argonaute protein outside of the miRNA effector pathway, in buffering dsRNA-induced interferon responses. As AGO1x expression is tightly linked to breast cancer cell proliferation, our study suggests a new direction for limiting tumor growth.",

Furthermore, we found that TDP-43 modulates the small interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing machinery responsible for RTEs repression. Molecularly, we observed that TDP-43 regulates the expression levels of Dicer-2 by direct protein-mRNA interactions in vivo. Accordingly, the genetic or pharmacological recovery of Dicer-2 activity was sufficient to repress retrotransposons activation and revert the neurodegeneration in TDP-43-null Drosophila motoneurons.

Our analytical and numerical results reveal that social information can rescue populations from extinction and can shift the long-term outcome of competitive interactions from mutual exclusion to coexistence, or vice versa, depending on the relative strengths of intraspecific and interspecific social information and competition.

Genomes and plasmids were closed for three of the isolates using the PacBio(R) system. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome and the structures of MDR plasmids were investigated. Conjugation experiments were performed to determine the transferability of cfr(C) associated MDR plasmids. The spectrum of resistance encoded by the cfr(C) gene was further investigated by agar dilution antimicrobial susceptibility testing.\\n\\nResultsAll 16 FFNR isolates were MDR and exhibited co-resistance to ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, clindamycin and tetracycline. All isolates shared the same resistance genotype, carrying aph(3)-III, hph, {triangleup}aadE (truncated), blaOXA-61, cfr(C), and tet(O) genes plus a mutation of GyrA T86I. The cfr(C), aph(3)-III, hph {triangleup}aadE, and tet(O) genes were co-located on transferable MDR plasmids with size 48-50 kb.

Phylogenetic analysis showed SNP differences ranging from 11-2,248 among the 16 isolates.\\n\\nConclusionsThe results showed that the cfr(C) gene located in the conjugative pTet MDR/virulence plasmid is present in diverse strains, where it confers high levels of resistance to several antimicrobials, including linezolid, a critical drug for treating Gram positive bacterial infections in humans. This study highlights the power of genomic antimicrobial resistance surveillance to uncover the intricacies of transmissible co-resistance and provides information that is needed for accurate risk assessment and mitigation strategies.",

    "abstract": "Colonic bacterial populations are thought to have a role in the development of colorectal cancer with some protecting against inflammation and others exacerbating inflammation. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties and are produced in large quantities by colonic bacteria which produce SCFAs by fermenting fiber. We assessed whether there was an association between fecal SCFA concentrations and the presence of colonic adenomas or carcinomas in a cohort of individuals using 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic shotgun sequence data. We measured the fecal concentrations of acetate, propionate, and butyrate within the cohort and found that there were no significant associations between SCFA concentration and tumor status. When we incorporated these concentrations into random forest classification models trained to differentiate between people with normal colons and those with adenomas or carcinomas, we found that they did not significantly improve the ability of 16S rRNA gene or metagenomic gene sequence-based models to classify individuals. Finally, we generated random forest regression models trained to predict the concentration of each SCFA based on 16S rRNA gene or metagenomic gene sequence data from the same samples. These models performed poorly and were able to explain at most 14% of the observed variation in the SCFA concentrations. These results support the broader epidemiological data that questions the value of fiber consumption for reducing the risks of colorectal cancer. Although other bacterial metabolites may serve as biomarkers to detect adenomas or carcinomas, fecal SCFA concentrations have limited predictive power.\\n\\nImportanceConsidering colorectal cancer is the third leading cancer-related cause of death within the United States, it is important to detect colorectal tumors early and to prevent the formation of tumors. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are often used as a surrogate for measuring gut health and for being anti-carcinogenic because of their anti-inflammatory properties. We evaluated the fecal SCFA concentration of a cohort of individuals with varying colonic tumor burden who were previously analyzed to identify microbiome-based biomarkers of tumors. We were unable to find an association between SCFA concentration and tumor burden or use SCFAs to improve our microbiome-based models of classifying people based on their tumor status. Furthermore, we were unable to find an association between the fecal community structure and SCFA concentrations. Our results indicate that the association between fecal SCFAs, the gut microbiome, and tumor burden is weak.",

    "abstract": "The yeast [PSI+] prion, formed by the Sup35 (eRF3) protein, can exist as multiple structural variants exhibiting phenotypic variation in the strength of nonsense suppression and mitotic stability. Structure of [PSI+] and its variation is only partly characterized. Here, we mapped the Sup35 proteinase K-resistant amyloid cores of 26 [PSI+] prions of different origin, isolated from yeast cells. In all cases the Sup35 amino acid residues 2-32 were fully resistant and the region up to residue 72 was partially resistant. Proteinase K-resistant structures were also found within regions 73-124, 125-153 and 154-221, but their presence differed between [PSI+] isolates. The [PSI+] phenotype depended mainly, if not solely, on the structure in region 2-72. Structures in region 73-221 were in some cases mitotically unstable and heterogenous. Two distinct digestion patterns were observed for the 2-72 fragment, which correlated with the \\\"strong\\\" and \\\"weak\\\" [PSI+] nonsense-suppressor phenotypes. All [PSI+] with a weak pattern were eliminated by multicopy HSP104 gene and were not toxic when combined with multicopy SUP35. [PSI+] with a strong pattern showed opposite properties, being resistant to multicopy HSP104 and lethal in the presence of multicopy SUP35. Thus, our data suggest existence of two distinct and reliably distinguishable structural classes of [PSI+] rather than a continuum of prions with gradually altering phenotype.\\n\\nImportancePrions and amyloids are relatively novel and incompletely characterized structures. To understand them better, we mapped amyloid cores of 26 isolates of the Sup35 yeast prion using proteinase K digestion and mass spectrometry. We found that these cores are composed of up to four proteinase K-resistant elements spanning almost the whole length of Sup35 region inessential for viability. However, only the N-terminal element was present in all structures. There are many variants of the Sup35 prion, and these are usually roughly combined into two groups, \\\"strong\\\" and \\\"weak\\\", based on the strength of their nonsense-suppressor phenotype. However, it was not clear whether such groups could be distinguished by any reliable qualitative criteria. Our data indicate that these groups do exist and can be reliably distinguished based on the N-terminal element digestion pattern and the effects of the multicopy SUP35 and HSP104 genes on these prion variants.",

    "abstract": "Parasite-mediated selection is one of the main drivers of genetic variation in natural populations. The persistence of asexual reproduction and self-fertilization, however, challenges the notion that low genetic variation and inbreeding compromise the hosts ability to respond to pathogens. DNA methylation represents a potential mechanism for generating additional adaptive variation under low genetic diversity. We compared genetic diversity (microsatellites and AFLPs), variation in DNA methylation (MSAFLPs), and parasite loads in three populations of Kryptolebias hermaphroditus, a unique mixed-mating (partially self-fertilising) fish, to analyse the potential adaptive value of DNA methylation in relation to genetic diversity and parasite loads. We found strong genetic population structuring, as well as differences in parasite loads and methylation levels among sampling sites and selfing lineages. Globally, the interaction between parasites and inbreeding with selfing lineages influenced DNA methylation, but parasites seemed more important in determining methylation levels at the local scale.",

    "abstract": "Biomarkers are changes associated with the disease. Without homeostatic control, urine accumulates very early changes and is an ideal biomarker source. Usually, we performed urinary biomarker studies involving at least thousands of tumor cells. But no tumor starts from a thousand tumor cells. Can we observe any urine proteome changes in rats with approximately ten tumor cells subcutaneous inoculation? Here, we serially diluted Walker-256 carcinosarcoma cells to a concentration of 102/mL and subcutaneously inoculated 0.1 mL of these cells into nine rats. Urine proteomes on days 0, 13 and 21 were profiled by LC-MS/MS analysis and studied with unsupervised clustering analysis. Samples at three time points were almost clustered together, indicating a good consistency in these nine rats. Differential proteins on days 13 and 21 were mainly associated with cell adhesion, autophagic cell death, changes in extracellular matrix organization, angiogenesis, and the pentose phosphate pathway. All of these enriched functional processes were reported to contribute to tumor progression and could not be enriched through random allocation analysis. Our results indicated that 1) the urine proteome reflects changes associated with cancer even with approximately ten tumor cells in the body and that 2) the urine proteome reflects pathophysiological changes in the body with extremely high sensitivity and provides potential for a very early screening process of clinical patients.",

    "abstract": "PurposeTo introduce a novel magnetic-resonance fingerprinting (MRF) framework with single-shot echo-planar imaging (EPI) readout to simultaneously estimate tissue T2, T1 and T2*, and integrate B1 correction.\\n\\nMethodsSpin-echo EPI is combined with gradient-echo EPI to achieve T2 estimation as well as T1 and T2* quantification. In the dictionary matching step, the GE-EPI data segment provides estimates of tissue T1 and T2* with additional B1 information, which are then incorporated into the T2-matching step that uses the SE-EPI data segment. In this way, biases in T2 and T2* estimates do not affect each other.\\n\\nResultsAn excellent correspondence was found between our T1, T2, and T2* estimates and results obtained from standard approaches in both phantom and human scans. In the phantom scan, a linear relationship with R2>0.96 was found for all parameter estimates. The maximum error in the T2 estimate was found to be below 6%. In the in-vivo scan, similar contrast was noted between MRF and standard approaches, and values found in a small region of interest (ROI) located in the grey matter (GM) were in line with previous measurements (T2MRF=88{+/-}7ms vs T2Ref=89{+/-}11ms, T1MRF=1153{+/-}154ms vs T1Ref=1122{+/-}52ms, T2*MRF=56{+/-}4ms vs T2*Ref=53{+/-}3ms).\\n\\nConclusionAdding a spin echo data segment to EPI based MRF allows accurate and robust measurements of T2, T1 and T2* relaxation times. This MRF framework is easier to implement than spiral-based MRF. It doesnt suffer from undersampling artifacts and seems to require a smaller dictionary size that can fasten the reconstruction process.",

    "abstract": "Controlled transport of molecules across boundaries for energy exchange, sensing, and communication is an essential step toward cell-like synthetic systems. This communication between the gene expression compartment and the external environment requires reaction chambers that are permeable to molecular species that influence expression. In lipid vesicle reaction chambers, species that support expression - from small ions to amino acids - may diffuse across membranes and amplify protein production. However, vesicle-to-vesicle variation in membrane permeability may lead to low total expression and high variability in this expression. We demonstrate a simple optical treatment method that greatly reduces the variability in membrane permeability. When transport across the membrane was essential for expression, this optical treatment increased mean expression level by ~6-fold and reduced expression variability by nearly two orders of magnitude. These results demonstrate membrane engineering may enable essential steps toward cell-like synthetic systems. The experimental platform described here provides a means of understanding controlled transport motifs in individual cells and groups of cells working cooperatively through cell-to-cell molecular signaling.",

    "abstract": "Cryptic pockets are visible in ligand-bound protein structures but are occluded in unbound structures. Utilizing these pockets in fragment-based drug-design provides an attractive option for proteins not tractable by classical binding sites. However, owing to their hidden nature, they are difficult to identify. Here, we show that small glycols find cryptic pockets on diverse set of proteins. Initial crystallography experiments serendipitously revealed the ability of ethylene glycol, a small glycol, to identify a cryptic pocket on W6A mutant of RBSX protein (RBSX-W6A). Explicit-solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of RBSX-W6A with exposed-state of the cryptic pocket (ethylene glycol removed) revealed closure of the pocket reiterating that cryptic pockets in general prefer to stay in closed-state in absence of the ligands. Also, no change in the pocket was observed for simulations of RBSX-W6A with occluded-state of the cryptic pocket, suggesting that water molecules are not able to open the cryptic pocket. \"Cryptic-pocket finding\" potential of small glycols was then supported and generalized through additional crystallography experiments, explicit-cosolvent MD simulations, protein dataset construction and analysis. The cryptic pocket on RBSX-W6A was found again upon repeating the crystallography experiments with another small glycol, propylene glycol. Use of ethylene glycol as probe molecule in cosolvent MD simulations led to the enhanced sampling of the exposed-state of experimentally observed cryptic sites on test set of two proteins (Niemann-Pick C2, Interleukin-2). Further, analyses of protein structures with validated cryptic sites showed that ethylene glycol molecules binds to sites on proteins (G-actin, Myosin II, Bcl-xL, Glutamate receptor 2) which become apparent upon binding of biologically relevant ligands. Our study thus suggests potential application of the small glycols in experimental and computational fragment-based approaches to identify cryptic pockets in apparently undruggable and/or difficult targets, making these proteins amenable to drug-design strategies.",

    "abstract": "Most bacteria in nature exist in aggregated communities known as biofilms. Bacteria within biofilms are inherently highly resistant to antibiotics. Current understanding of the evolution and mechanisms of antibiotic resistance is largely derived from work from cells in liquid culture and it is unclear whether biofilms adapt and evolve in response to sub-inhibitory concentrations of drugs. Here we used a biofilm evolution model to show that biofilms of a model food borne pathogen, Salmonella Typhimurium rapidly evolve in response to exposure to three clinically important antibiotics. Whilst the model strongly selected for improved biofilm formation in the absence of any drug, once antibiotics were introduced the need to adapt to the drug was more important than the selection for improved biofilm formation. Adaptation to antibiotic stress imposed a marked cost in biofilm formation, particularly evident for populations exposed to cefotaxime and azithromycin. We identified distinct resistance phenotypes in biofilms compared to corresponding planktonic control cultures and characterised new mechanisms of resistance to cefotaxime and azithromycin. Novel substitutions within the multidrug efflux transporter, AcrB were identified and validated as impacting drug export as well as changes in regulators of this efflux system. There were clear fitness costs identified and associated with different evolutionary trajectories. Our results demonstrate that biofilms adapt rapidly to low concentrations of antibiotics and the mechanisms of adaptation are novel. This work will be a starting point for studies to further examine biofilm specific pathways of adaptation which inform future antibiotic use.",

    "abstract": "Glycosomes are peroxisome-related organelles that compartmentalise the glycolytic enzymes in kinetoplastid parasites. These organelles are developmentally regulated in their number and composition, allowing metabolic adaptation to the parasites needs in the blood of mammalian hosts or within their arthropod vector. A protein phosphatase cascade regulates differentiation between parasite developmental forms, comprising a tyrosine phosphatase, TbPTP1, that dephosphorylates and inhibits a serine threonine phosphatase TbPIP39 that promotes differentiation. When TbPTP1 is inactivated, TbPIP39 is activated and during differentiation becomes located in glycosomes. Here we have tracked TbPIP39 recruitment to glycosomes during differentiation from bloodstream stumpy forms to procyclic forms. Detailed microscopy and live cell imaging during the synchronous transition between life cycle stages revealed that in stumpy forms, TbPIP39 is located at a periflagellar pocket site closely associated with TbVAP, that defines the flagellar pocket endoplasmic reticulum. TbPTP1 is also located at the same site in stumpy forms, as is REG9.1, a regulator of stumpy-enriched mRNAs. This site provides a molecular node for the interaction between TbPTP1 and TbPIP39. Within 30 minutes of the initiation of differentiation TbPIP39 relocates to glycosomes whereas TbPTP1 disperses to the cytosol. Overall, the study identifies a  stumpy regulatory nexus (STuRN) that co-ordinates the molecular components of life cycle signalling and glycosomal development during transmission of Trypanosoma brucei.\\n\\nImportanceAfrican trypanosomes are parasites of sub-Saharan Africa responsible for both human and animal disease. The parasites are transmitted by tsetse flies and completion of their life cycle involves progression through several development steps. The initiation of differentiation between blood and tsetse forms is signalled by a phosphatase cascade, ultimately trafficked into peroxisome-related organelles called glycosomes that are unique to this group of organisms. Glycosomes undergo substantial remodelling of their composition and function during the differentiation step but how this is regulated is not understood. Here we identify a cytological site where the signalling molecules controlling differentiation converge before the dispersal of one of them into glycosomes. This coincides with a specialised ER site that may contribute to glycosome developmental biogenesis or regeneration. In combination, the study provides the first insight into the spatial co-ordination of signalling pathway components in trypanosomes as they undergo cell-type differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Endophytic microorganisms are well established for their mutualistic relationship and plant growth promotion through production of different metabolites. Bacteria and fungi are the major group of endophytes which were extensively studied. Virus are badly named for centuries and their symbiotic relationship was vague. Recent development of omics tools especially next generation sequencing has provided a new perspective towards the mutualistic viral relationship. Endogenous virus which has been much studied in animal and are less understood in plants. In this study, we described the endophytic viral population of tea plant root. Viral population (9%) were significantly less while compared to bacterial population (90%). Viral population of tea endophytes were mostly dominated by endogenous pararetroviral sequences (EPRV) derived from Caulimoviridae and Geminiviridae. Subclassification of Caulimoviridae showed the dominance of Badnavirus (42%), Caulimovirus (29%), Soymovirus (3%), Tungrovirus (3%), while Geminviridae was only represented by genus Bagmovirus. Interestingly, the endophytic virome sequence from root also showed the presence of phage virus from order Caudovirales. Identified sequence from Caudovirales were Myoviridae and Siphoviridae. Sequence comparison with viral population of soil and root showed the possibility of horizontal transfer of Caudovirales from soil to root environment. This study will expand the knowledge on endogenous viruses especially for tea plant. This study will also help us to understand the symbiotic integration of viral particle with plant which could be used in broader sense to tackle different agronomic problems.\\n\\nSignificance StatementVirus were badly named for centuries and mostly known for their disease-causing abilities. But recent development of omics tools has focused another facet which is symbiotic. This paper discusses about viral community identified from shotgun sequence of tea root samples which are endogenous in origin. Interestingly, we also identified sequences of phage virus from Caudovirales family which possibly have transmitted from soil. Here we also compared the soil virome community with tea virome to establish the hypothesis. This research will broaden the current knowledge on symbiotic relationship of virus and plant.",

    "abstract": "The SIR complex (Silent Information Regulator) is the building block of heterochromatic structures that silence underlying genes. It is well established that the silenced state is epigenetically inherited but it is not known how the SIR complex is maintained through cell divisions in optimal or variable growth conditions. The biological function of heterochromatin located in subtelomeric regions is also unclear since heterochromatin coverage appears to be limited to a few kbps near chromosome ends and the expression of subtelomeric genes is only marginally affected in the absence of the SIR complex. We use a three pronged approach to address these questions. First, nanopore-MetID, an in vivo foot printing technique similar to DamID that uses nanopore sequencing technology, identified thousands of new transient contacts between Sir3 and euchromatic genes that are not detectable by ChIP-seq and revealed a previously undocumented low-density mode of Sir3 binding to subtelomeric regions that extends 25kbps downstream of subtelomeric SIR nucleation sites. Second, our measurements of genome-wide Sir3 exchange rates after exit from starvation show that heterochromatin is a highly dynamic structure in optimal growth conditions. Third, \"spike-in\" RNA-seq time course experiments in the same conditions reveal that Sir3 modulates global mRNA levels in correlation with fluctuations in nutrient availability. We now propose that subtelomeric regions serve as Sir3 hubs from which Sir3 diffuses down the chromosome arm and transiently contacts euchromatic genes in its path. We hypothesize that contacts between Sir3 and actively transcribed genes facilitate the removal of stalled transcription complexes and allow for optimal genome-wide transcription, which gives wt cells a competitive advantage over sir3{Delta} cells when nutrients are limited.",

    "abstract": "Priming refers to the influence that a previously encountered object exerts on future responses to similar objects. For many years, visual priming has been known as a facilitation and sometimes an inhibition effect that lasts for an extended period of time. It contrasts with the recent finding of an oscillated priming effect where facilitation and inhibition alternate over time periodically. Here we developed a computational model of visual priming that combines rhythmic sampling of the environment (attentional oscillation) with active preparation for future events (temporal expectation). Counterintuitively, it shows both the sustained and oscillated priming effects can emerge from an interaction between attentional oscillation and temporal expectation. The interaction also leads to novel predictions such as the change of visual priming effects with temporal expectation and attentional oscillation. Reanalysis of two published datasets and the results of two new experiments of visual priming tasks with male and female human participants provide support for the models relevance to human behavior. More generally, our model offers a new perspective that may unify the increasing findings of behavioral and neural oscillations with the classic findings in visual perception and attention.\n\nSignificance StatementThere is increasing behavioral and neural evidence that visual attention is a periodic process that sequentially samples different alternatives in the theta frequency range. It contrasts with the classic findings of sustained facilitatory or inhibitory attention effects. How can an oscillatory perceptual process give rise to sustained attention effects? Here we make this connection by proposing a computational model for a \"fruit fly\" visual priming task and showing both the sustained and oscillated priming effects can have the same origin: an interaction between rhythmic sampling of the environment and active preparation for future events. One unique contribution of our model is to predict how temporal contexts affects priming. It also opens up the possibility of reinterpreting other attention-related classic phenomena.",

Of interest, we have found that sEH is upregulated in brains from AD patients. We have evaluated the cognitive impairment and the pathological hallmarks in two models of age-related cognitive decline and AD using three structurally different and potent sEH inhibitors as chemical probes. Our findings supported our expectations on the beneficial effects of central sEH inhibition, regarding of reducing cognitive impairment, tau hyperphosphorylation pathology and the number of amyloid plaques.

    "abstract": "We recently demonstrated that the role of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a ubiquitously expressed enzyme that governs cell-autonomous metabolic homeostasis, has been extended to system-level control of breathing and thus oxygen and energy (ATP) supply to the body. Here we assess the contribution to the hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) of two upstream kinases that govern the activities of AMPK. Lkb1, which activates AMPK in response to metabolic stress and CaMKK2 which mediates the alternative Ca2+-dependent mechanism of AMPK activation. HVRs remained unaffected in mice with global deletion of the CaMKK2 gene. By contrast, HVRs were markedly attenuated in mice with conditional deletion of LKB1 in catecholaminergic cells, including carotid body type I cells and brainstem respiratory networks. In these mice hypoxia evoked hypoventilation, apnoea and Cheyne-Stokes-like breathing, rather than hyperventilation. Attenuation of HVRs, albeit less severe, was also conferred in mice carrying [~]90% knockdown of Lkb1 expression. Carotid body afferent input responses were retained following either [~]90% knockdown of Lkb1 or AMPK deletion. In marked contrast, LKB1 deletion virtually abolished carotid body afferent discharge during normoxia, hypoxia and hypercapnia. We conclude that Lkb1 and AMPK, but not CaMKK2, facilitate HVRs at a site downstream of the carotid bodies.",

This ability to impart left-sided character is lost in parapineal cells lacking Sox1a function, despite the normal specification of the parapineal itself. Precisely timed laser ablation experiments demonstrate that the parapineal influences neurogenesis in the left habenula at early developmental stages as well as neurotransmitter phenotype and efferent connectivity during subsequent stages of habenular differentiation. These studies reveal a tight coordination between the formation of the unilateral parapineal nucleus and emergence of asymmetric habenulae, ensuring that appropriate lateralised character is propagated within left and right-sided circuitry.",

    "abstract": "Polygenic scores are a popular tool for prediction of complex traits. However, prediction estimates in samples of unrelated participants can include effects of population stratification, assortative mating and environmentally mediated parental genetic effects, a form of genotype-environment correlation (rGE). Comparing genome-wide polygenic score (GPS) predictions in unrelated individuals with predictions between siblings in a within-family design is a powerful approach to identify these different sources of prediction. Here, we compared within- to between-family GPS predictions of eight life outcomes (anthropometric, cognitive, personality and health) for eight corresponding GPSs. The outcomes were assessed in up to 2,366 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs from the Twins Early Development Study from age 12 to age 21. To account for family clustering, we used mixed-effects modelling, simultaneously estimating within- and between-family effects for target- and cross-trait GPS prediction of the outcomes. There were three main findings: (1) DZ twin GPS differences predicted DZ differences in height, BMI, intelligence, educational achievement and ADHD symptoms; (2) target and cross-trait analyses indicated that GPS prediction estimates for cognitive traits (intelligence and educational achievement) were on average 60% greater between families than within families, but this was not the case for non-cognitive traits; and (3) this within- and between-family difference for cognitive traits disappeared after controlling for family socio-economic status (SES), suggesting that SES is a source of between-family prediction through rGE mechanisms. These results provide novel insights into the patterns by which rGE contributes to GPS prediction, while ruling out confounding due to population stratification and assortative mating.",

    "abstract": "One of the most influential accounts of central orbitofrontal cortex- that it mediates behavioral flexibility - has been challenged by the finding that discrimination reversal in macaques -the classic test of behavioral flexibility -is unaffected when lesions are made by excitotoxin injection rather than aspiration. This suggests the critical brain circuit mediating behavioral flexibility in reversal tasks lies beyond the central orbitofrontal cortex. To determine its identity a group of nine macaques were taught discrimination reversal learning tasks and its impact on grey matter was measured. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were taken before and after learning and compared with scans from two control groups each comprising ten animals. One control group learned similar discrimination tasks but which lacked any reversal component and the other control group engaged in no learning. Grey matter changes were prominent in posterior orbitofrontal cortex/anterior insula but also were found in three other frontal cortical regions: lateral orbitofrontal cortex (12o), cingulate cortex, and lateral prefrontal cortex. In a second analysis, neural activity in posterior orbitofrontal cortex/anterior insula was measured at rest and its pattern of coupling with the other frontal cortical regions was assessed. Activity coupling increased significantly in the reversal learning group in comparison to controls. In a final set of experiments we used similar structural imaging procedures and analyses to demonstrate that aspiration lesion of central orbitofrontal cortex, of the type known to affect discrimination learning, affected structure and activity in the same frontal cortical circuit. The results identify a distributed frontal cortical circuit associated with behavioral flexibility.",

    "abstract": "Crop models contain a number of genotype-dependent parameters, which need to be estimated for each genotype. This is a major difficulty in crop modeling. We propose a hybrid method for adapting a crop model to new genotypes. The genotype-dependent parameters of the model could be obtained by phenotyping (or gene-based modeling). Then field data for example from variety trials could be used to provide a simple empirical correction to the model, of the form a+b times an environmental variable. This approach combines the advantages of phenotyping, namely that the genotype-specific parameters have a clear meaning and are comparable between genotypes, and the advantages of fitting the model to field data, namely that the corrected model is adapted to a specific target population. It has the advantage of being very simple to apply, and furthermore gives useful information as to which environmental variables are not fully accounted for in the initial model. In this study, this empirical correction is applied to the SUNFLO crop model for sunflower, using field data from a multi-environment trial network. The empirical correction reduced mean squared error (MSE) on the average by 54% for prediction of yield and by 26% for prediction of oil content, compared to the initial model. Most of the improvement came from eliminating bias, with some further improvement from the environmental term in the regression.",

    "abstract": "The microbiota populating the rhizosphere, the interface between roots and soil, can modulate plant growth, development and health. These microbial communities are not stochastically assembled from the surrounding soil but their composition and putative function are controlled, at least partially, by the host plant. Here we use the staple cereal barley as a model to gain novel insights into the impact of differential applications of nitrogen, a rate-limiting step for global crop production, on the host genetic control of the rhizosphere microbiota. Using a high-throughput amplicon sequencing survey, we determined that nitrogen availability for plant uptake is a factor promoting the selective enrichment of individual taxa in the rhizosphere of wild and domesticated barley genotypes. Shotgun sequencing and metagenome-assembled genomes revealed that this taxonomic diversification is mirrored by a functional specialisation, manifested by the differential enrichment of multiple GO-terms, of the microbiota of plants exposed to nitrogen conditions limiting barley growth. Finally, a plant soil feedback experiment revealed that the host control on the barley microbiota underpins the assembly of a phylogenetically diverse group of bacteria putatively required to sustain plant performance under nitrogen-limiting supplies. Taken together, our observations indicate that under nitrogen conditions limiting plant growth, plant-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions fine-tune the host genetic selection of the barley microbiota at both taxonomic and functional levels. The disruption of these recruitment cues negatively impacts plant growth.\n\nImportanceThe microbiota inhabiting the rhizosphere, the thin layer of soil surrounding plant roots, can promote the growth, development, and health of their host plants. Previous research indicated that differences in the genetic composition of the host plant coincide with differences in the composition of the rhizosphere microbiota. This is particularly evident when looking at the microbiota associated to input-demanding modern cultivated varieties and their wild relatives, which have evolved under marginal conditions. However, the functional significance of these differences remains to be fully elucidated. We investigated the rhizosphere microbiota of wild and cultivated genotypes of the global crop barley and determined that nutrient conditions limiting plant growth amplify the host control on microbes at the root-soil interface. This is reflected in a plant- and genotype-dependent functional specialisation of the rhizosphere microbiota which appears required for optimal plant growth. These findings provide novel insights into the significance of the rhizosphere microbiota for plant growth and sustainable agriculture",

By swinging bats in a pendulum, we tested the influence of acoustic playback on the echolocation behavior of Carollia perspicillata. This paradigm evokes reproducible orientation behavior and allows a precise definition of the influence of the acoustic context. Our results show that bats dynamically switch between different adaptations to cope with sound-based navigation in acoustically contaminated environments.

    "abstract": "Plant mitochondrial genomes vary widely in size. Although many plant mitochondrial genomes have been sequenced and assembled, the vast majority are of angiosperms, and few are of gymnosperms. Most plant mitochondrial genomes are smaller than a megabase, with a few notable exceptions. We have sequenced and assembled the 5.5 Mbp mitochondrial genome of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), the largest complete mitochondrial genome of a gymnosperm. We sequenced the whole genome using Oxford Nanopore MinION, and then identified contigs of mitochondrial origin assembled from these long reads. The assembly graph shows a multipartite genome structure, composed of one smaller 168 kbp circular segment of DNA, and a larger 5.4 Mbp component with a branching structure. The assembly graph gives insight into a putative complex physical genome structure, and its branching points may represent active sites of recombination.",

    "abstract": "Morphogenetic movements require tight spatiotemporal control over cell-cell junction lengths. Contractile forces, acting at adherens junctions, alter cell-cell contact lengths in a cyclic fashion as a mechanical ratchet. Pulsatile RhoA activity is thought to drive ratcheting through acute periods of junction contraction followed by stabilization. Currently, we lack a mechanistic understanding of if and how RhoA activity governs junction length and subsequent cell shape within epithelia. In this study we use optogenetics to exogenously control RhoA activity in model Caco-2 epithelium. We find that at short timescales, RhoA activation drives reversible junction contraction. Sustained RhoA activity drives irreversible junction shortening but the amount of shortening saturates for a single pulse. To capture these data, we develop a vertex model modified to include strain-dependent junction length and tension remodeling. We find that, to account for experimental data, tension remodeling requires a strain-dependent threshold. Our model predicts that temporal structuring of RhoA activity allows for subsequent tension remodeling events to overcome the limited shortening within a single pulse and this is confirmed by our experimental data. We find that RhoA-mediated junction remodeling requires activities of formin and dynamin, indicating the closely inter-connected activities of contractility, E-cadherin clustering, and endocytosis. Junction length is therefore regulated by the coordinated action of RhoA-mediated contractility, membrane trafficking, and adhesion receptor remodeling. Altogether these data provide insights into the underlying molecular and biophysical mechanisms of RhoA-mediated regulation of epithelial cell shape.",

    "abstract": "Recent technological advances such as single-cell RNAseq1-3 and CRISPR-CAS9-mediated knock-out4 have allowed an unprecedented access into processes orchestrating human preimplantation development5. However, the sequence of events which occur during human preimplantation development are still unknown. In particular, timing of first human lineage specification, the process by which the morula cells acquire a specific fate, remains elusive. Here, we present a human preimplantation development model based on transcriptomic pseudotime modelling of scRNAseq biologically validated by spatial information and precise time-lapse staging. In contrast to mouse, we show that trophectoderm (TE) / inner cell mass (ICM) lineage specification in human is only detectable at the transcriptomic level at the blastocyst stage, just prior to expansion. We validated the expression profile of novel markers enabling precise staging of human preimplantation embryos, such as IFI16 which highlights establishment of epiblast (EPI) and NR2F2 which appears at the transition from specified to mature TE. Strikingly, mature TE cells arise from the polar side, just after specification, supporting a model of polar TE cells driving TE maturation. Altogether, our study unravels the first lineage specification event in the human embryo and provides a browsable resource for mapping spatio-temporal events underlying human lineage specification.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARYWhile many neuronal membrane-anchored proteins undergo proteolytic cleavage, little is known about the biological significance of neuronal ectodomain shedding. Using mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, we showed that the neuronal sheddome mirrors human cerebrospinal fluid (hCSF). Among shed synaptic proteins in hCSF was the ectodomain of CNTNAP2 (CNTNAP2-ecto), a risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). Using structured-illumination microscopy (SIM), we mapped the spatial organization of neuronal CNTNAP2-ecto shedding. Using affinity chromatography followed by MS, we identified the ATP2B/PMCA Ca2+ extrusion pumps as novel CNTNAP2-ecto binding partners. CNTNAP2-ecto coimmunoprecipitates with PMCA2, a known autism risk factor, and enhances its activity, thereby modulating neuronal Ca2+ levels. Finally, we showed that CNTNAP2-ecto regulates neuronal network synchrony in primary cultures and brain slices. These data provide new insights into the biology of synaptic ectodomain shedding and reveal a novel mechanism of regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis and neuronal network synchrony.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian odorant receptors are a diverse and rapidly evolving set of G protein-coupled receptors expressed in olfactory cilia membranes. Most odorant receptors show little to no cell surface expression in non-olfactory cells due to endoplasmic reticulum retention, which has slowed down biochemical studies. Here, we provide evidence that structural instability and divergence from conserved residues of individual odorant receptors underlie intracellular retention using a combination of large-scale screening of odorant receptors cell surface expression in heterologous cells, point mutations, structural modeling, and machine learning techniques. We demonstrate the importance of conserved residues by synthesizing \"consensus\" odorant receptors that show high levels of cell surface expression similar to conventional G protein-coupled receptors. Furthermore, we associate in silico structural instability with poor cell surface expression using molecular dynamics simulations. We propose an enhanced evolutionary capacitance of olfactory sensory neurons that enable the functional expression of odorant receptors with cryptic mutations.\n\nSignificance StatementOdor detection in mammals depends on the largest family of G protein-coupled receptors, the odorant receptors, which represent [~]2% of our protein-coding genes. The vast majority of odorant receptors are trapped within the cell when expressed in non-olfactory cells. The underlying causes of why odorant receptors cannot be functionally expressed in non-olfactory cells have remained enigmatic for over 20 years. Our study points to divergence from a consensus sequence as a key factor in a receptors inability to function in non-olfactory cells, which in turn, helps explain odorant receptors exceptional functional diversity and rapid evolution. We also show the success of protein engineering strategies for promoting odorant receptor cell surface expression.",

    "abstract": "Aging is associated with progressive and site-specific changes in DNA methylation (DNAm). These global changes are captured by DNAm clocks that accurately predict chronological age in humans but relatively little is known about how clocks perform in vitro. Here we culture primary human fibroblasts across the cellular lifespan ([~]6 months) and use four different DNAm clocks to show that age-related DNAm signatures are conserved and accelerated in vitro. The Skin & Blood clock shows the best linear correlation with chronological time (r=0.90), including during replicative senescence. Although similar in nature, the rate of epigenetic aging is approximately 62x times faster in cultured cells than in the human body. Consistent with in vivo data, cells aged under hyperglycemic conditions exhibit an approximately three years elevation in baseline DNAm age. Moreover, candidate gene-based analyses further corroborate the conserved but accelerated biological aging process in cultured fibroblasts. Fibroblasts mirror the established DNAm topology of the age-related ELOVL2 gene in human blood and the rapid hypermethylation of its promoter cg16867657, which correlates with a linear decrease in ELOVL2 mRNA levels across the lifespan. Using generalized additive modeling on twelve timepoints across the lifespan, we also show how single CpGs exhibit loci-specific, linear and nonlinear trajectories that reach rates up to -47% (hypomethylation) to +23% (hypermethylation) per month. Together, these high temporal resolution global, gene-specific, and single CpG data highlight the conserved and accelerated nature of epigenetic aging in cultured fibroblasts, which may constitute a system to evaluate age-modifying interventions across the lifespan.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/605295_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (60K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@101e4f2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15df049org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4a704dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@112f970_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical Abstract\\n\\nC_FIG",

Similar to how a reference genome sequence revolutionized human genetics, a reference map of the human interactome network is critical to fully understand genotype-phenotype relationships. Here we present the first human \\\"all-by-all\\\" binary reference interactome map, or \\\"HuRI\\\". With ~53,000 high-quality protein-protein interactions (PPIs), HuRI is approximately four times larger than the information curated from small-scale studies available in the literature. Integrating HuRI with genome, transcriptome and proteome data enables the study of cellular function within essentially any physiological or pathological cellular context. We demonstrate the use of HuRI in identifying specific subcellular roles of PPIs and protein function modulation via splicing during brain development. Inferred tissue-specific networks reveal general principles for the formation of cellular context-specific functions and elucidate potential molecular mechanisms underlying tissue-specific phenotypes of Mendelian diseases. HuRI thus represents an unprecedented, systematic reference linking genomic variation to phenotypic outcomes.",

    "abstract": "O_LIunimodally to temperature, i.e., be maximized at intermediate temperatures and constrained at extreme low and high temperatures. However, empirical evidence linking hot temperatures to decreased transmission in nature remains limited.\\nC_LIO_LIWe tested the hypothesis that hot temperatures constrain transmission in a zooplankton-fungus (Daphnia dentifera-Metschnikowia bicuspidata) disease system where autumnal epidemics typically start after lakes cool from their peak summer temperatures. This pattern suggested that maximally hot summer temperatures could be inhibiting disease spread.\\nC_LIO_LIUsing a series of lab experiments, we examined the effects of high temperatures on five mechanistic components of transmission. We found that (1) high temperatures increased exposure to parasites by speeding up foraging rate but (2) did not alter infection success post-exposure. (3) High temperatures lowered parasite production (due to faster host death and an inferred delay in parasite growth). (4) Parasites made in hot conditions were less infectious to the next host (instilling a parasite  rearing or  trans-host effect of temperature during the prior infection). (5) High temperatures in the free-living stage also reduce parasite infectivity, either by killing or harming parasites.\\nC_LIO_LIWe then assembled the five mechanisms into an index of disease spread. The resulting unimodal thermal response was most strongly driven by the rearing effect. Transmission peaked at intermediate-hot temperatures (25-26{degrees}C) and then decreased at maximally hot temperatures (30-32{degrees}C). However, transmission at these maximally hot temperatures only trended slightly lower than the baseline control (20{degrees}C), which easily sustains epidemics in laboratory conditions and in nature. Overall, we conclude that while exposure to hot epilimnetic temperatures does somewhat constrain disease, we lack evidence that this effect fully explains the lack of summer epidemics in this natural system. This work demonstrates the importance of experimentally testing hypothesized mechanisms of thermal constraints on disease transmission. Furthermore, it cautions against drawing conclusions based on field patterns and theory alone.\\nC_LI",
