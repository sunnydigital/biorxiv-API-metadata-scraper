    "abstract": "TH17 cells exhibit great heterogeneity and variable functional states in vivo. However, metabolic reprogramming of TH17 cells in vivo and its regulation during autoimmunity and host defence is unknown. Here we report that TH17 cells derived in vivo show discrete metabolic states. Metabolic states of TH17 cells in vivo were controlled at the epigenetic level, with conserved regulatory region of key metabolic regulators show distinct chromatin accessibility as demonstrated by chromatin landscape profiling. TGF-{beta}1 signaling was further shown to be crucial for remodeling of TH17 cell chromatin states, Ahr and miR-21 were identified as essential metabolic regulators for TH17 cells. Understanding metabolic reprogramming of TH17 cells in vivo may therefore provide more defined therapeutic intervention to TH17 cell mediated autoimmune diseases and insights into TH17 cell mediated host defence.",

    "abstract": "Prior to selecting an action, we often consider other possibilities. How does the brain represent these preliminary plans prior to action selection? Here, we investigated this question in the oculomotor system during self-guided search of natural scenes. We found two classes of neurons in the frontal eye field (FEF): 1) \\\"late selection neurons\\\" that represented the selected action plan not long before the upcoming saccade, and 2) \\\"early selection neurons\\\" that became predictive of the upcoming saccade much earlier, often before the previous saccade had even ended. Crucially, these early selection neurons did not only predict the upcoming saccade direction; they also reflected the probabilities of possible upcoming saccades, even when they did not end up being selected. Our results demonstrate that during naturalistic eye movements, separate populations of neurons code for preliminary and definitive plans.",

    "abstract": "Amphibians have remarkable regenerative capabilities, but the mechanisms they use to regenerate are largely unknown. Identifying these mechanism would be of great interest for applications in medicine. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are continually produced and required during tadpole tail regeneration (1). Production of ROS and tadpole tail regeneration are prevented by NADPH oxidase (Nox) inhibitors, suggesting Nox complexes as the source of ROS. However, the role of ROS and the mechanism of their sustained production throughout regeneration, were not known. NF-{kappa}B is a rapid-acting transcription factor with the potential to dramatically alter the activity and function of a cell (2). NF-{kappa}B is necessary for maintaining the undifferentiated state of human embryonic stem cells (3), human induced pluripotent stem cells (4) and mesenchymal stem cells (5), so may similarly be involved in maintaining the de-differentiated state of regeneration blastema cells. In the absence of an activating signal, NF-{kappa}B is sequestered in the cytoplasm by IkB (inhibitor of NF-{kappa}B), preventing its nuclear localisation and activity. The IkB kinase (IKK) complex inhibits IkB in response to multiple extracellular stimuli, but ROS can also inhibit IkB (6). Nuclear NF-{kappa}B directly activates transcription of several genes encoding Nox proteins (7, 8), so could thereby facilitate ROS production. A positive-feedback loop was hypothesised where ROS inhibit IkB to help maintain continual NF-{kappa}B activity and, in turn, facilitate the continual production of ROS by activating the transcription of Nox-encoding genes. Here we demonstrate the involvement of microorganisms in the initiation of tadpole tail regeneration. Microorganisms offer sources of ligands for toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway activation and consequently, IKK complex activity. It was also suggested that sustained NF-{kappa}B activity allows the continual expression of the genes encoding Nox4 in blastema cells and Nox2 in professional phagocytes. These findings provide potential targets for the activation of regeneration in non-regenerative animals.",

    "abstract": "There are numerous different odorant molecules in nature. Typical odors are sparse mixtures of a few types of odorant molecules each with a wide range of concentrations. However, there are only a relatively small number of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), which respond to odorant concentration nonlinearly (sigmoidal) with a finite sensitivity range. Thus, how to encode a large number of sparse odor mixtures with a relatively small number of nonlinear ORNs - the nonlinear compressed sensing problem - remains a puzzle. Here, by using an information theory approach, we study the optimal coding strategies that enable nonlinear ORNs to best represent olfactory information (both the odorants identities and their concentrations) in sparse odor mixtures. Our extensive numerical simulations and analytical analysis show that the optimal odor-receptor sensitivity matrix is sparse and the nonzero sensitivities follow roughly a log-normal distribution(matching the statistics of the odorants), both of which are consistent with existing experiments. For ORNs with a finite basal activity, our study shows that co-existence of both odor-evoked excitation and inhibition increases coding capacity, which provides a plausible explanation for such co-existence observed in the fly olfactory system. Furthermore, we show that coding the inputs with the optimal sensitivity matrix can enhance accuracy of the downstream decoding and learning tasks. These general statistical properties of the optimal sensitivity matrix for nonlinear compressed sensing may shed light on understanding the peripheral olfactory sensory system and improving performance of artificial neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Stable localization of the Rheb GTPase to lysosomes is thought to be required for activation of mTORC1 signaling. However, the lysosome targeting mechanisms for Rheb remain unclear. We therefore investigated the relationship between Rheb subcellular localization and mTORC1 activation. Surprisingly, we found that although Rheb was prominently enriched at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Rheb was undetectable at lysosomes. Functional assays in knockout human cells revealed that farnesylation of the C-terminal CaaX motif on Rheb was essential for both Rheb enrichment on ER membranes and mTORC1 activation. However, constitutively targeting Rheb to ER membranes did not support mTORC1 activation. Further systematic analysis of the Rheb hypervariable region revealed that weak, non-selective, farnesylation-dependent, membrane interactions confer Rheb function without the need for a specific lysosome targeting motif. Collectively, these results argue against stable interactions of Rheb with lysosomes and instead that transient membrane interactions optimally allow Rheb to activate mTORC1 signaling.",

Using long-term (30 years) individual data on 231 female polar bears (Ursus maritimus), we assessed age- and size-specific variation on litter size. Litter size varied with maternal age, younger females had higher chances of losing a cub during their first months of life. Results suggest an improvement of breeding abilities early in life due to experience with subsequent reproductive senescence. Litter size increased with maternal size, indicating that size may reflect individual quality. Heterogeneity was observed among the largest females, suggesting that large size comes at a cost.

Most commonly used tools in the field rely on high quality genome-wide data with matched normal profiles, limiting their applicability in clinical settings.\n\nMethodsWe propose a workflow, based on the open-source PureCN R/Bioconductor package in conjunction with widely used variant-calling and copy number segmentation algorithms, for allele-specific CNA analysis from whole exome sequencing (WES) without matched normals. We use The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ovarian carcinoma (OV) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) datasets to benchmark its performance against gold standard SNP6 microarray and WES datasets with matched normal samples. Our workflow further classifies SNVs by somatic status and then uses this information to infer somatic mutational signatures and tumor mutational burden (TMB).\n\nResultsApplication of our workflow to tumor-only WES data produces tumor purity and ploidy estimates that are highly concordant with estimates from SNP6 microarray data and matched-normal WES data. The presence of cancer type-specific somatic mutational signatures was inferred with high accuracy. We also demonstrate high concordance of TMB between our tumor-only workflow and matched normal pipelines.\n\nConclusionThe proposed workflow provides, to our knowledge, the only open-source option for comprehensive allele-specific CNA analysis and SNV classification of tumor-only WES with demonstrated high accuracy.",

    "abstract": "The survival of a birds egg depends upon their ability to maintain within strict thermal limits. Avian eggshell colours have long been considered a phenotype that can help them stay within these thermal limits, with dark eggs absorbing heat more rapidly than bright eggs. Although long disputed, evidence suggests that darker eggs do increase in temperature more rapidly than lighter eggs, explaining why dark eggs are often considered as a cost to trade-off against crypsis. Although studies have considered whether eggshell colours can confer an adaptive benefit, no study has demonstrated evidence that eggshell colours have actually adapted for this function. This would require data spanning a wide phylogenetic diversity of birds and a global spatial scale. Here we show evidence that darker and browner eggs have indeed evolved in cold climes, and that the thermoregulatory advantage for avian eggs is a stronger selective pressure in cold climates. Temperature alone predicted more than 80% of the global variation in eggshell colour and luminance. These patterns were directly related to avian nesting strategy, such that all relationships were stronger when eggs were exposed to incident solar radiation. Our data provide strong evidence that sunlight and nesting strategies are important selection pressures driving egg pigment evolution through their role in thermoregulation. Moreover, our study advances understanding of how traits have adapted to local temperatures, which is essential if we are to understand how organisms will be impacted by global climate change.",

Phenotype switching between a proliferative and an invasive state has been suggested as a critical process for metastasis. The mechanisms that regulate these transitions are poorly understood, but are associated with transcriptional changes. Brother of Regulator of Imprinted Sites (BORIS), also known as CCCTC binding factor-Like (CTCFL), is a transcriptional modulator that becomes aberrantly expressed in melanoma. Here, we provide the first evidence that BORIS is involved in phenotype switching in melanoma. Genetic modification of BORIS expression in melanoma cells combined with whole transcriptome analysis indicated that BORIS expression contributes to an invasion-associated transcriptome. In agreement with this finding, inducible BORIS overexpression in melanoma cells reduced proliferation and increased migration and invasion, demonstrating that the transcriptional switch is accompanied by a phenotypic switch. Overall, our study indicates a pro-invasive role for BORIS in melanoma via transcriptional reprogramming.",

We introduce scSplit which utilises genetic differences inferred from scRNA-Seq data alone to demultiplex pooled samples. scSplit also extracts a minimal set of high confidence presence/absence genotypes in each cluster which can be used to map clusters to original samples. Using a range of simulated, merged individual-sample as well as pooled multi-individual scRNA-Seq datasets, we show that scSplit is highly accurate and concordant with demuxlet predictions. Furthermore, scSplit predictions are highly consistent with the known truth in cell-hashing dataset. We also show that multiplexed-scRNA-Seq can be used to reduce batch effects caused by technical biases. scSplit is ideally suited to samples for which external genome-wide genotype data cannot be obtained (for example non-model organisms), or for which it is impossible to obtain unmixed samples directly, such as mixtures of genetically distinct tumour cells, or mixed infections. scSplit is available at: https://github.com/jon-xu/scSplit",

The collective FG nup behaviour has long been conceptualized either as a polymer brush, dominated by entropic and excluded-volume (repulsive) interactions, or as a hydrogel, dominated by cohesive (attractive) interactions between FG nups. Here we compare mesoscale computational simulations with a wide range of experimental data to demonstrate that FG nups are at the crossover point between these two regimes. Specifically, we find that repulsive and attractive interactions are balanced, resulting in morphologies and dynamics that are close to those of ideal polymer chains. We demonstrate that this property of FG nups yields sufficient cohesion to seal the transport barrier, and yet maintains fast dynamics at the molecular scale, permitting the rapid polymer rearrangements needed for transport events.",

Analysis of ATAC-seq data illustrated two distinct transcription factor (TF) clusters that dynamically regulate NK cell differentiation. Moreover, two TFs from the second cluster, FOSL2 and EGR2, were identified as novel essential TFs that control NK cell maturation and function. Knocking down either of these two TFs significantly impacted NK cell transformation. Finally, we constructed a genome-wide transcriptional regulatory network that provides an understanding of the regulatory dynamics during NK cell differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Sequences derived from parvoviruses (family Parvoviridae) are relatively common in animal genomes, but the functional significance of these endogenous parvoviral element (EPV) sequences remains unclear. In this study we use a combination of in silico and molecular biological approaches to investigate a fusion gene encoded by guinea pigs (genus Cavia) that is partially derived from an EPV. This gene, named enRep-Myo9, encodes a predicted polypeptide gene product comprising a partial myosin9 (Myo9)-like gene fused to a 3 truncated, EPV- encoded replicase. We first examined the genomic and phylogenetic characteristics of the EPV locus that encodes the viral portions of enRep-Myo9. We show that this locus, named enRep, is specific to guinea pigs and derives from an ancient representative of the parvoviral genus Dependoparvovirus that integrated into the guinea pig germline 22-35 million years ago. Despite these ancient origins, however, the regions of enRep that are incorporated into the coding sequence of the enRep-Myo9 gene are conserved across multiple species in the family Caviidae (guinea pigs and cavies) consistent with purifying selection. Using molecular biological approaches, we further demonstrate that: (i) enRep-Myo9 mRNA is broadly transcribed in guinea pig cells; (ii) the cloned enRep-Myo9 transcript can express a protein of the expected size in guinea pig cells in vitro, and; (iii) the expressed protein localizes to the cytosol. Our findings demonstrate that, consistent with a functional role, the enRep-Myo9 fusion gene is evolutionarily conserved, broadly transcribed, and capable of expressing protein.\\n\\nImportanceDNA from viruses has been  horizontally transferred to mammalian genomes during evolution, but the impact of this process on mammalian biology remains poorly understood. The findings of our study indicate that in guinea pigs a novel gene has evolved through fusion of host and virus genes.",

    "abstract": "The data in this report summarises the responses gathered from 365 principle investigators of academic laboratories, who started their independent positions in the UK within the last 6 years up to 2018. We find that too many new investigators express frustration and poor optimism for the future. These data also reveal, that many of these individuals lack the support required to make a successful transition to independence and that simple measures could be put in place by both funders and universities in order to better support these early career researchers. We use these data to make both recommendations of good practice and for changes to policies that would make significant improvements to those currently finding independence challenging. We find that some new investigators face significant obstacles when building momentum and hiring a research team. In particular, access to PhD students. We also find some important areas such as starting salaries where significant gender differences persist, which cannot be explained by seniority. Our data also underlines the importance of support networks, within and outside the department, and the positive influence of good mentorship through this difficult career stage.",

Yellow fever, an acute mosquito-borne viral haemorrhagic fever, re-emerged in Nigeria in 2017 after decades of relative control.1 Once a major public health concern in the region,2 the prolonged absence of yellow fever has left a gap in knowledge about circulating virus and lowered clinical suspicion for a disease whose spectrum overlaps with endemic infections (e.g., malaria and Lassa fever).

Sero-prevalence of T. gondii antibodies was 27% (27/100) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 18.6 - 36.8%. Among seropositive population 81% (22/27), 15% (4/27) and 4% (1/27) were seropositive for IgG antibodies, IgM antibodies and both antibodies respectively. Age group 21-30 years old had the highest frequency of detected IgG (10/45) and IgM (3/45). Married women had the highest frequency of detected IgG or IgM, 18/79 and 3/79, respectively. Risk factors analysis showed a total of 37/100 participants were having direct contact with cats and 66/100 have a frequent raw meat consumption, neither direct cats contact nor raw meat consumption had statistically significant association with seropositivity to T. gondii (P. value =0.052 and 0.565, respectively).",

    "abstract": "A detailed understanding of abiotic stress tolerance in plants is essential to provide food security in the face of increasingly harsh climatic conditions. Glucosinolates (GLSs) are secondary metabolites found in the Brassicaceae that protect plants from herbivory and pathogen attack. Here we report that in Arabidopsis, aliphatic GLS levels are regulated by the auxin-sensitive Aux/IAA repressors IAA5, IAA6, and IAA19. These proteins act in a transcriptional cascade that maintains expression of GLS levels when plants are exposed to drought conditions. Loss of IAA5/6/19 results in reduced GLS levels and decreased drought tolerance. Further, we show that this phenotype is associated with a defect in stomatal regulation. Application of GLS to the iaa5,6,19 mutants restores stomatal regulation and normal drought tolerance. GLS action is dependent on the receptor kinase GHR1, suggesting that GLS may signal via reactive oxygen species. These results provide a novel connection between auxin signaling, GLS levels and drought response.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryAux/IAA proteins promote drought tolerance by regulating glucosinolate levels.",
