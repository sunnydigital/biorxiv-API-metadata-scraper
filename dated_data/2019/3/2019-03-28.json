    "abstract": "Monovision corrections are a common treatment for presbyopia. Each eye is fit with a lens that sharply focuses light from a different distance, causing the image in one eye to be blurrier than the other. Millions of people in the United States and Europe have monovision corrections, but little is known about how differential blur affects motion perception. We investigated by measuring the Pulfrich effect, a stereo-motion phenomenon first reported nearly 100 years ago. When a moving target is viewed with unequal retinal illuminance or contrast in the two eyes, the target appears to be closer or further in depth than it actually is, depending on its frontoparallel direction. The effect occurs because the image with lower illuminance or contrast is processed more slowly. The mismatch in processing speed causes a neural disparity, which results in the illusory motion in depth. What happens with differential blur? Remarkably, differential blur causes a reverse Pulfrich effect, an apparent paradox. Blur reduces contrast and should therefore cause processing delays. But the reverse Pulfrich effect implies that the blurry image is processed more quickly. The paradox is resolved by recognizing that: i) blur reduces the contrast of high-frequency image components more than low-frequency image components, and ii) high spatial frequencies are processed more slowly than low spatial frequencies, all else equal. Thus, this new illusion--the reverse Pulfrich effect--can be explained by known properties of the early visual system. A quantitative analysis shows that the associated misperceptions are large enough to impact public safety.",

    "abstract": "AbstractEpicardium, the mesothelium covering the heart, is composed of multipotent cells and is reactivated following myocardial injury in adults. Herein, we provide evidence for activation of atrial epicardium in aged patients with diseased atria and in murine models of atrial remodeling. Epicardial activation contributed to fibro-fatty infiltration of sub-epicardium that contained a number of cells co-expressing markers of epicardial progenitors and fibroblasts. Indeed, using genetic lineage tracing of adult epicardium, we demonstrate the epicardial origin of fibroblasts within fibro-fatty infiltrates. A subpopulation of adult epicardial-derived cells (aEPDCs) expressing PDGFR, niched in the sub-epicardium, were isolated and differentiated into myofibroblast in the presence of angiotensin-II. Furthermore, single cell RNA-seq analysis identified several clusters of aEPDCs and revealed transition from adipogenic to fibrogenic cells. In conclusion, a subset of aEPDCs, pre-programmed towards a specific cell fate, contributes to fibro-fatty infiltration of sub-epicardium of diseased atria.",

However, little is known about the genetic basis of RSA and resource adaptive responses in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Here, a high-throughput germination paper plant phenotyping system was used to identify seedling traits in a wheat doubled haploid mapping population, Savannah x Rialto. Significant genotypic and nitrate-N treatment variation was found across the population for seedling traits with distinct trait grouping for root size-related traits and root distribution-related traits. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis identified a total of 59 seedling trait QTLs. Across two nitrate treatments, 27 root QTLs were specific to the nitrate treatment. Transcriptomic analyses for one of the QTLs on chromosome 2D found under low nitrate conditions was pursued revealing gene enrichment in N-related biological processes and 17 candidate up-regulated genes with possible involvement in a root angle response. Together, these findings provide genetic insight into root system architecture and plant adaptive responses to nitrate and provide targets that could help improve N capture in wheat.",

    "abstract": "Cell growth is well described at the population level, but precisely how nutrient and water uptake and cell wall expansion drive the growth of single cells is poorly understood. Supported by measurements of single-cell growth trajectories and cell wall elasticity, we present a single-cell growth model for yeast. The model links the thermodynamic quantities turgor pressure, osmolarity, cell wall elasto-plasticity, and cell size, using concepts from rheology and thin shell theory. It reproduces cell size dynamics during single-cell growth, budding, and hyper- or hypoosmotic stress. We find that single-cell growth rate and final size are primarily governed by osmolyte uptake and consumption, while bud expansion depends additionally on different cell wall extensibilities of mother and bud. Based on first principles the model provides a more accurate description of size dynamics than previous attempts and its analytical simplification allows for easy combination with models for other cell processes.",

However, there are a number of drugs and human ingestibles approved for a variety of indications/diseases that can be potentially repurposed as new treatments for others, decreasing the time and cost required.\\n\\nMethodsCANDO (Computational Analysis of Novel Drug Opportunities) is a platform for shotgun, multitarget drug discovery and repurposing. The CANDO platform scores interactions between 46,784 proteins structures and 3,733 human use compounds using a bioinformatic docking protocol to generate compound-proteome interaction signatures that are then compared to identify candidates for repurposing. Benchmarking of the platform is accomplished by comparing the compound-proteome interaction signatures and determining whether signatures corresponding to pairs of drugs approved for the same indication fall within particular cutoffs.\\n\\nResultsWe have altered the scoring function of bioinformatic docking protocol in the newest version of our platform (v1.5) to use the best OBscore for each compound-protein interaction, resulting in an increased benchmarking accuracy from 11.7% in v1 to 12.8% in v1.5 for the top10 cutoff, the most stringent one used, and correspondingly from 24.9% to 31.2% for the top100 cutoff.\\n\\nConclusionsThe change in the interaction scoring and other bug fixes in CANDO v1.5 have resulted in improved benchmarking performance, making the platform more effective at predicting novel, therapeutic drug-indication pairs.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the global quality and local (residual-specific) quality of a single protein structural model is important for protein structure prediction and application. In this work, we developed a deep one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN) that predicts the absolute local quality of a single protein model as well as two 1DCNNs to predict both local and global quality simultaneously through a novel multi-task learning framework. The networks accept sequential and structural features (i.e. amino acid sequence, agreement of secondary structure and solvent accessibilities, residual disorder properties and Rosetta energies) of a protein model of any size as input to predict its quality, which is different from existing methods using a fixed number of hand-crafted features as input. Our three methods (InteractQA-net, JointQA-net and LocalQA-net) were trained on the structural models of the single-domain protein targets of CASP8, 9, 10 and evaluated on the models of CASP11 and CASP12 targets. The results show that the performance of our deep learning methods is comparable to the state-of-the-art quality assessment methods. Our study also demonstrates that combining local and global quality predictions together improves the global quality prediction accuracy.

To illustrate the power of this model, we develop an algorithm for estimating the parameters of a phylogenetic network topology under this unified model. The algorithm consists of a set of moves that allow for stochastic search through the parameter space. The challenges with developing such moves stem from the intricate dependencies among the three pieces of the model. We demonstrate the application of the model and the accuracy of the algorithm on simulated as well as biological data.\\n\\nOur work adds to the biologists toolbox of methods for phylogenomic inference by accounting for more complex evolutionary processes.",

    "abstract": "Sex chromosomes have evolved independently multiple times in eukaryotes and are therefore considered a prime example of convergent genome evolution. Sex chromosomes are known to emerge after recombination is halted between a homologous pair of chromosomes and this leads to a range of non-adaptive modifications causing the gradual degeneration and gene loss on the sex-limited chromosome. However, because studies on sex chromosomes have primarily focused on old and highly differentiated sex chromosomes, the causes of recombination suppression and the pace at which degeneration subsequently occurs remain unclear. Here, we use long- and short-read single molecule sequencing approaches to assemble and annotate a draft genome of the basket willow, Salix viminalis, a species with a female heterogametic system at the earliest stages of sex chromosome emergence. Our single-molecule approach allowed us to phase the emerging Z and W haplotypes in a female, and we detected very low levels of Z/W divergence, largely the result of the accumulation of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the non-recombining region. Linked-read sequencing of the same female and an additional male (ZZ) revealed the presence of two evolutionary strata supported by both divergence between the Z and W haplotypes and by haplotype phylogenetic trees. Gene order is still largely conserved between the Z and W homologs, although a few genes present on the Z have already been lost from the W. Furthermore, we use multiple lines of evidence to test for inversions, which have long been assumed to halt recombination between the sex chromosomes. Our data suggest that selection against recombination is a more gradual process at the earliest stages of sex chromosome formation than would be expected from an inversion. Our results present a cohesive understanding of the earliest genomic consequences of recombination suppression as well as valuable insights into the initial stages of sex chromosome formation.",

    "abstract": "Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by age-inappropriate symptoms of inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity that persist into adulthood in the majority of the diagnosed children. Despite several risk factors during childhood predicting the persistence of ADHD symptoms into adulthood, the genetic architecture underlying the trajectory of ADHD over time is still unclear. We set out to study the contribution of common genetic variants to the risk for ADHD across the lifespan by conducting meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies on persistent ADHD in adults and ADHD in childhood separately and comparing the genetic background between them in a total sample of 17,149 cases and 32,411 controls. Our results show nine new independent loci and support a shared contribution of common genetic variants to ADHD in children and adults. No subgroup heterogeneity was observed among children, while this group consists of future remitting and persistent individuals. We report similar patterns of genetic correlation of ADHD with other ADHD-related datasets and different traits and disorders among adults, children and when combining both groups. These findings confirm that persistent ADHD in adults is a neurodevelopmental disorder and extend the existing hypothesis of a shared genetic architecture underlying ADHD and different traits to a lifespan perspective.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHuman gut microbiome profiles have been associated with human health and disease. These profiles have been defined based on microbes taxonomy and more recently, on their functionality. Human groups that still maintain traditional modes of subsistence (hunter-gatherers and rural agriculturalists) represent the groups non-impacted by urban-industrialized lifestyles, and therefore study them provide the basis for understanding the human microbiome evolution. The Yanomami is the largest semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer group of the Americas, exploring different niches of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil and Venezuela. In order to extend the analysis of this unique and diverse group, we focused on the gut microbiome of the Yanomami from Brazil and compared with those from Venezuela, and also with other traditional groups from the Amazon, considering taxonomic and functional profiles.\n\nResultsA diversity of taxonomic biomarkers were identified to each South American traditional group studied, including the two Yanomami groups, despite their overall similarity in the taxonomic gut microbiome profiles. Broader levels of functional categories poorly discriminated traditional and urban-industrialized groups. Interestingly, a diversity was observed with the stratification of these categories, clearly segregating those groups. The Yanomami/Brazil gut microbiome presented unique functional features, such as a higher abundance of gene families involved in regulation/cell signaling, motility/chemotaxis, and virulence, contrasting with the microbiomes from the Yanomami/Venezuela and other groups.\n\nConclusionsOur study revealed biomarkers, taxonomic and functional differences between the gut microbiome of Yanomami/Brazil and Yanomami/Venezuela individuals. This intra-Yanomami group diversity was accessed due to the increase number of individuals and group studied. These differences may reflect their semi-nomadic behavior, as well as, the local and seasonal diversity of the vast rainforest niche they explore, despite their shared cultural and genetic background. Overall, their microbiome profiles are shared with South American and African traditional groups, probably due to their lifestyle. The unique features identified within the Yanomami highlight the bias imposed by underrepresented sampling, and factors such as variations over space and time (seasonality) that impact, mainly, the hunter-gatherers. Therefore, to reach knowledge about human microbiome variations and their implications in human health, it is essential to enlarge data concerning the number of individuals, as well as the groups representing different lifestyles.",

    "abstract": "Genome editing using the CRISPR Cas9 system has been used to manipulate eukaryotic DNA and make precise heritable changes. Although the widely used Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) and its engineered variants have been efficiently harnessed for numerous gene-editing applications across different platforms, concerns remain, regarding their putative off targeting at multiple loci across the genome. Here we report that Francisella novicida Cas9 (FnCas9) shows a very high specificity of binding to its intended targets and negligible binding to off-target loci. The specificity is determined by its minimal binding affinity with DNA when mismatches to the target sgRNA are present in the sgRNA:DNA heteroduplex. FnCas9 produces staggered cleavage, higher HDR rates and very low non-specific genome editing compared to SpCas9. We demonstrate FnCas9 mediated correction of the sickle cell mutation in patient derived iPSCs and propose that it can be used for precise therapeutic genome editing for a wide variety of genetic disorders.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTTherapeutic genome editing has been significantly accentuated by the advent of CRISPR based gene correction. However, genomic off-targeting has been a major setback for clinical translation. Although high fidelity versions of Cas9 have been rationally designed, they recognize and bind to off-targets. In this study, we characterize a naturally occurring Cas9 from Francisella novicida (FnCas9) that shows negligible binding affinity to off targets differing by one or more mismatches, rendering it highly specific in target recognition and editing. We show that FnCas9 can direct both HDR and NHEJ mediated DNA repair, generates higher rate of HDR and negligible off-target editing. Finally we show its potential in therapeutic genome editing by correcting the sickle cell anemia mutation in patient derived iPSCs.",

    "abstract": "The functional organization of human auditory cortex can be probed by characterizing responses to various classes of sound at different anatomical locations. Along with histological studies this approach has revealed a primary field in posteromedial Heschls gyrus (HG) with pronounced induced high-frequency (70-150 Hz) activity and short-latency responses that phase-lock to rapid transient sounds. Low-frequency neural oscillations are also relevant to stimulus processing and information flow, however their distribution within auditory cortex has not been established. Alpha activity (7-14 Hz) in particular has been associated with processes that may differentially engage earlier versus later levels of the cortical hierarchy, including functional inhibition and the communication of sensory predictions. These theories derive largely from the study of occipitoparietal sources readily detectable in scalp electroencephalography. To characterize the anatomical basis and functional significance of less accessible temporal-lobe alpha activity we analyzed responses to sentences in seven human adults (four female) with epilepsy who had been implanted with electrodes in superior temporal cortex. In contrast to primary cortex in posteromedial HG, a non-primary field in anterolateral HG was characterized by high spontaneous alpha activity that was strongly suppressed during auditory stimulation. Alpha-power suppression decreased with distance from anterolateral HG throughout superior temporal cortex, and was more pronounced for clear compared to degraded speech. This suppression could not be accounted for solely by a change in the slope of the power spectrum. The differential manifestation and stimulus-sensitivity of alpha oscillations across auditory fields should be accounted for in theories of their generation and function.\\n\\nSignificance StatementTo understand how auditory cortex is organized in support of perception, we recorded from patients implanted with electrodes for clinical reasons. This allowed measurement of activity in brain regions at different levels of sensory processing. Oscillations in the alpha range (7-14 Hz) have been associated with functions including sensory prediction and inhibition of regions handling irrelevant information, but their distribution within auditory cortex is not known.

    "abstract": "The functional organization of human auditory cortex can be probed by characterizing responses to various classes of sound at different anatomical locations. Along with histological studies this approach has revealed a primary field in posteromedial Heschls gyrus (HG) with pronounced induced high-frequency (70-150 Hz) activity and short-latency responses that phase-lock to rapid transient sounds. Low-frequency neural oscillations are also relevant to stimulus processing and information flow, however their distribution within auditory cortex has not been established. Alpha activity (7-14 Hz) in particular has been associated with processes that may differentially engage earlier versus later levels of the cortical hierarchy, including functional inhibition and the communication of sensory predictions. These theories derive largely from the study of occipitoparietal sources readily detectable in scalp electroencephalography. To characterize the anatomical basis and functional significance of less accessible temporal-lobe alpha activity we analyzed responses to sentences in seven human adults (four female) with epilepsy who had been implanted with electrodes in superior temporal cortex. In contrast to primary cortex in posteromedial HG, a non-primary field in anterolateral HG was characterized by high spontaneous alpha activity that was strongly suppressed during auditory stimulation. Alpha-power suppression decreased with distance from anterolateral HG throughout superior temporal cortex, and was more pronounced for clear compared to degraded speech. This suppression could not be accounted for solely by a change in the slope of the power spectrum. The differential manifestation and stimulus-sensitivity of alpha oscillations across auditory fields should be accounted for in theories of their generation and function.\\n\\nSignificance StatementTo understand how auditory cortex is organized in support of perception, we recorded from patients implanted with electrodes for clinical reasons. This allowed measurement of activity in brain regions at different levels of sensory processing. Oscillations in the alpha range (7-14 Hz) have been associated with functions including sensory prediction and inhibition of regions handling irrelevant information, but their distribution within auditory cortex is not known. A key finding was that these oscillations dominated in one particular non-primary field, anterolateral Heschls gyrus, and were suppressed when subjects listened to sentences. These results build on our knowledge of the functional organization of auditory cortex and provide anatomical constraints on theories of the generation and function of alpha oscillations.",

    "abstract": "Since the introduction of metabolic models and flux balance analysis (FBA) in systems biology, several attempts have been made to add expression data. However, directly accounting for enzyme and mRNA production in the mathematical programming formulation is challenging because of macromolecules, which introduces a bilinear term in the mass-balance equations that become harder to solve than linear formulations like FBA. Furthermore, there have been no attempts to include thermodynamic constraints in these formulations, which would yield an even more complex mixed-integer non-linear problem.\\n\\nWe propose here a new framework, called Expression and Thermodynamics Flux (ETFL), as a new ME-model implementation. ETFL is a top-down model formulation, from metabolism to RNA synthesis, that simulates thermodynamic-compliant intracellular fluxes as well as enzyme and mRNA concentration levels. The formulation results in a mixed-integer linear problem (MILP) that enables both relative and absolute metabolite, protein, and mRNA concentration integration. The proposed formulation is compatible with mainstream MILP solvers and does not require a non-linear solver. It also accounts for growth-dependent parameters, such as relative protein or mRNA content.\\n\\nWe present here the formulation of ETFL along with its validation using results obtained from a well-characterized E. coli model. We show that ETFL is able to reproduce proteome-limited growth, which FBA cannot. We also subject it to different analyses, including the prediction of feasible mRNA and enzyme concentrations in the cell, and propose ETFL-based adaptations of other common FBA-based procedures.\\n\\nThe software is available on our public repository at https://github.com/EPFL-LCSB/etfl.\\n\\nAuthor summaryMetabolic modeling is a useful tool for biochemists who want to tweak biological networks for the direct expression of key products, such as biofuels, specialty chemicals, or drug candidates. To provide more accurate models, several attempts have been made to account for protein expression and growth-dependent parameters, key components of biological networks, though this is computationally challenging, especially when also attempting to include thermodynamics. To the best of our knowledge, there is no published methods integrating these three types of constraints in one model. We propose here a transparent mathematical formulation to model both expression and metabolism of a cell, along with a reformulation that allows a computationally tractable inclusion of growth-dependent parameters and thermodynamics. We demonstrate good performance using community-standard software, and propose ways to adapt classical modeling studies to expression-enabled models. The incorporation of thermodynamics and growth-dependent variables provide a finer modeling of expression because they eliminate thermodynamically unfeasible solutions and consider phenotypic differences in different growth regimens, which are key for accurate modeling.",

    "abstract": "Groups of social predators capture large prey items collectively, and their social interaction patterns may impact how quickly they can respond to time-sensitive predation opportunities. We investigated whether various organizational levels of resting interactions (individual, sub-group, group), observed at different intervals leading up to a collective prey attack, impacted the predation speed of colonies of the social spider Stegodyphus dumicola. We found that in adult spiders overall group connectivity (average degree) increased group attack speed. However, this effect was detected only immediately before the predation event; connectivity two and four days before prey capture had little impact on the collective dynamics. Significantly, lower social proximity of the groups boldest individual to other group members (closeness centrality) immediately prior and two days before prey capture was associated with faster attack speeds. These results suggest that for adult spiders, the long-lasting effects of the boldest individual on the groups attack dynamics are mediated by its role in the social network, and not only by its boldness. This suggests that behavioural traits and social network relationships should be considered together when defining keystone individuals in some contexts. By contrast, for subadult spiders, while the group maximum boldness was negatively correlated with latency to attack, no significant resting network predictors of latency to attack were found. Thus, separate behavioural mechanisms might play distinctive roles in determining collective outcomes at different developmental stages, timescales, and levels of social organization.\\n\\nSignificance statementCertain animals in a group, such as leaders, may have a more important role than other group members in determining their collective behavior. Often these individuals are defined by their behavioral attributes, for example, being bolder than others. We show that in social spiders both the behavioral traits of the influential individual, and its interactions with other group members, shape its role in affecting how quickly the group collectively attacks prey.",

    "abstract": "Optimum health benefits of omega-3 fatty acids ({omega}-3 FAs) require it to be concentrated in its natural sources. Fatty acid selectivity of lipase governs the efficacy of the production of lipase-mediated {omega}-3 FAs concentrates. We attempted to improve the fatty acid selectivity of a lipase from thermophilic bacterium Geobacillus thermoleovorans (GTL) by two approaches. In a semi-rational approach, six amino acid positions of GTL interacting with the substrate, were identified by docking and were subjected to site-saturation mutagenesis. Three best substitutions were incorporated into GTL(CM-GTL). Hydrolysis of oil by lipase was monitored in a pH-Stat and the fatty acids released at various time points were analyzed by GC-MS.CM-GTL showed a significant improvement in discrimination against DHA during hydrolysis. In the second approach based on rational design, the active site was narrowed by incorporating heavier amino acids in the lining of acyl-binding pocket to hinder access to bulky {omega}-3 FAs. For this purpose, two amino acids surrounding the opening of the acyl pocket were replaced with the next heavier amino acids and the affinities were evaluated in silico. The double mutant, thus deigned, was found to be excellent in discriminating the {omega}-3 FAs during hydrolysis of triglycerides. Engineering the binding pocket of a complex substrate, such as a triglyceride, with the supportive information on substrate structure and its binding modes with the enzyme provided by computational methods, has resulted in designing two efficient lipase variants with improved substrate selectivity.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell analysis is a powerful technique used to identify a specific cell population of interest during differentiation, aging, or oncogenesis. Individual cells occupy a particular transient state in the cell cycle, circadian rhythm, or during cell death. An appealing concept of pseudo-time trajectory analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data was proposed in the software Monocle, and several methods of trajectory analysis have since been published to date. These aim to infer the ordering of cells and enable the tracing of gene expression profile trajectories in cell differentiation and reprogramming. However, the methods are restricted in terms of time structure because of the pre-specified structure of trajectories (linear, branched, tree or cyclic) which contrasts with the mixed state of single cells.\\n\\nHere, we propose a technique to extract underlying flows in single-cell data based on the Hodge decomposition (HD). HD is a theorem of vector fields on a manifold which guarantees that any given flow can decompose into three types of orthogonal component: gradient-flow (acyclic), curl-, and harmonic-flow (cyclic). HD is generalized on a simplicial complex (graph) and the discretized HD has only a weak assumption that the graph is directed. Therefore, in principle, HD can extract flows from any mixture of tree and cyclic time flows of observed cells. The decomposed flows provide intuitive interpretations about complex flow because of their linearity and orthogonality. Thus, each extracted flow can be focused on separately with no need to consider crosstalk.\\n\\nWe developed ddhodge software, which aims to model the underlying flow structure that implies unobserved time or causal relations in the hodge-podge collection of data points. We demonstrated that the mathematical framework of HD is suitable to reconstruct a sparse graph representation of diffusion process as a candidate model of differentiation while preserving the divergence of the original fully-connected graph. The preserved divergence can be used as an indicator of the source and sink cells in the observed population. A sparse graph representation of the diffusion process transforms data analysis of the non-linear structure embedded in the high-dimensional space of single-cell data into inspection of the visible flow using graph algorithms. Hence, ddhodge is a suitable toolkit to visualize, inspect, and subsequently interpret large data sets including, but not limited to, high-throughput measurements of biological data.\\n\\nThe beta version of ddhodge R package is available at: https://github.com/kazumits/ddhodge",

    "abstract": "Exocytic transport of transmembrane receptors and secreted ligands provides the basis for cellular communication in animals. The RAB8/RAB3/RAB27 trafficking regulators function in transport processes towards the cell membrane. The small G-proteins recruit a diversity of effectors that mediate transport along microtubule and actin tracks, as well as membrane tethering and fusion. SPIRE actin nucleators organise local actin networks at exocytic vesicle membranes. By complex formation with class-5 myosins, vesicle transport track generation and motor protein activation are coordinated. Our phylogenetic analysis traced the onset of SPIRE function back to the origin of the Holozoa. We have identified SPIRE in the closest unicellular relatives of animals, the choanoflagellates, and the more distantly related ichthyosporeans. The discovery of a SPIRE-like protein encoding a KIND and tandem-WH2 domains in the amoebozoan Physarum polycephalum suggests that the SPIRE-type actin nucleation mechanism originated even earlier. Choanoflagellate SPIRE interacts with RAB8, the sole choanoflagellate representative of the metazoan RAB8/RAB3/RAB27 family. Major interactions including MYO5, FMN-subgroup formins and vesicle membranes are conserved between the choanoflagellate and mammalian SPIRE proteins and the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis SPIRE protein can rescue mouse SPIRE1/2 function in melanosome transport. Genome duplications generated two mammalian SPIRE genes (SPIRE1 and SPIRE2) and allowed for the separation of SPIRE protein function in terms of tissue expression and RAB GTPase binding. SPIRE1 is highest expressed in the nervous system and interacts with RAB27 and RAB8. SPIRE2 shows high expression in the digestive tract and specifically interacts with RAB8. We propose that at the dawn of the animal kingdom a new transport mechanism came into existence, which bridges microtubule tracks, detached vesicles and the cellular actin cytoskeleton by organising actin/myosin forces directly at exocytic vesicle membranes. The new degree of freedom in transport may reflect the increased demands of the sophisticated cellular communications in animals.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOW\"Occasional\" sexuality occurs when a species combines clonal reproduction and genetic mixing. This strategy is predicted to combine the advantages of both asexuality and sexuality, but its actual consequences on the genetic diversity and species longevity are poorly understood. Androgenesis, a reproductive mode in which the offspring inherits its entire nuclear genome from the father, is often reported as a strictly clonal reproductive mode. Androgenesis is the predominant reproductive mode within the hermaphroditic, invasive lineages of the mollusk genus Corbicula. Their ability to reproduce clonally through androgenesis has been determinant in their invasive success, having colonized during the 20th century American and European freshwater systems, where they became notorious invaders with a widespread, global distribution. However, in androgenetic Corbicula clams, occasional genetic mixing between distinct lineages has also been observed when the sperm of one lineage fertilizes the oocyte of another one. Because of these occasional introgressions, the genetic relationships between Corbicula species remained unclear, and the biogeographic origins of the invasive androgenetic lineages have been challenging to identify. To address these issues, we analyzed the patterns of allele sharing for several nuclear and mitochondrial molecular markers among Corbicula individuals collected across both the native and invasive range. Our results show the occurrence of an allelic pool encompassing all Corbicula freshwater species worldwide, including sexual and androgenetic ones, which highlights the substantial genetic mixing within this genus. However, the differences in allele sharing patterns between invasive lineages, and the low diversity within each lineage, suggest recent, distinct biogeographic origins of invasive Corbicula androgenetic lineages. Finally, the polyploidy, high heterozygosity, and hybrid phenotypes and genotypes found in our study probably originated from hybridization events following egg parasitism between distinct Corbicula lineages. This extensive cross-lineage mixing found in Corbicula may generate nuclear diversity in an otherwise asexually reproducing species.",

    "abstract": "Cells in microbial colonies integrate information across multiple spatial and temporal scales while sensing environmental cues. A number of photosynthetic cyanobacteria respond in a directional manner to incident light, resulting in the phototaxis of individual cells. Colonies of such bacteria exhibit large-scale changes in morphology, arising from cell-cell interactions, during phototaxis. These interactions occur through type IV pili-mediated physical contacts between cells, as well as through the secretion of complex polysaccharides ( slime) that facilitates cell motion. Here, we describe a computational model for such collective behaviour in colonies of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis. The model is designed to replicate observations from recent experiments on the emergent response of the colonies to varied light regimes. It predicts the complex colony morphologies that arise as a result. We ask if changes in colony morphology during phototaxis can be used to infer if cells integrate information from multiple light sources simultaneously, or respond to these light sources separately at each instant of time. We find that these two scenarios cannot be distinguished from the shapes of colonies alone. However, we show that tracking the trajectories of individual cyanobacteria provides a way of determining their mode of response. Our model allows us to address the emergent nature of this class of collective bacterial motion, linking individual cell response to the dynamics of colony shape.\\n\\nStatement of SignificanceMicrobial colonies in the wild often consist of large groups of heterogeneous cells that coordi-nate and integrate information across multiple spatio-temporal scales.

We investigated ways to optimize the line intersect method and root depth measurements with respect to data variability and the time spent on counting roots.\\n\\nMethodsRoot intensity was measured with three different grid patterns and different lengths of counting line on 2 m long transparent tube rhizotrons. Rooting depth was recorded by measuring the depth of the deepest root and by measuring the depth below which 5, 10 and 25 roots were observed.\\n\\nResultsFor root intensity the coefficient of variation (CV) was reduced 10-50 percentage points for grids that distributed counting lines equally across the measured area compared to using a restricted centralized area. In addition, the CV approached an asymptote of around 40 % when more than 50 root intersections per grid were observed. Further we show that recordings of the deepest root gave the most variance and least difference between means with a p-value of 0.65 for difference between cultivars. In contrast, a significant difference between cultivar rooting depths (p = 0.01) was found when using the depth below which 25 roots were observed.\\n\\nConclusionWe propose the use of grid designs adapted to different root densities to decrease time spent on counting roots at high root intensities, and minimize data variability at low root intensities. Further on rooting depth measurements including more roots may be a more useful parameter statistically to reveal variety or treatment differences in rooting depth.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA better understanding of malaria transmission at a local scale is essential for developing and implementing effective control strategies. In the frame of a randomized control trial, we aimed to provide an updated description of malaria transmission in the Korhogo area, northern Cote dIvoire, and to get baseline data for the trial.\\n\\nMethodsWe performed Human Landing Collections in 26 villages in the Korhogo area during the rainy season (September-October 2016, April-May 2017) and the dry season (November-December 2016, February-March 2017). We used Polymerase chain reaction techniques to ascertain the species of the An. gambiae complex, Plasmodium sp sporozoite infection and insecticide resistance mechanisms in a subset of Anopheles vectors.\\n\\nResultsAnopheles gambiae s.l. was the predominant malaria vector in the Korhogo area. Overall, more vectors were collected outdoors than indoors (P < 0.001). Of the 774 An. gambiae s.l. tested in the laboratory, 89.65% were An. gambiae s.s. and 10.35% were An. coluzzii. The frequencies of the kdr allele were very high in An. gambiae s.s. but the ace-1 allele was found at moderate frequencies. An unprotected individual living in the Korhogo area received an average of 9.04, 0.63, 0.06 and 0.12 infected bites per night in September-October, November-December, February-March, and April-May, respectively.\\n\\nConclusionsThe intensity of malaria transmission is extremely high in the Korhogo area, especially during the rainy season. Malaria control in highly endemic areas such as Korhogo needs to be strengthened with complementary tools in order to reduce the burden of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Deep sequencing of transposon mutant libraries (or TnSeq) is a powerful method for probing essentiality of genomic loci under different environmental conditions. Various analytical methods have been described for identifying conditionally essential genes whose tolerance for insertions varies between two conditions. However, for large-scale experiments involving many conditions, a method is needed for identifying genes that exhibit significant variability in insertions across multiple conditions. In this paper, we introduce a novel statistical method for identifying genes with significant variability of insertion counts across multiple conditions based on Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) regression. Using likelihood ratio tests, we show that the ZINB fits TnSeq data better than either ANOVA or a Negative Binomial (in a generalized linear model). We use ZINB regression to identify genes required for infection of M. tuberculosis H37Rv in C57BL/6 mice. We also use ZINB to perform a retrospective analysis of genes conditionally essential in H37Rv cultures exposed to multiple antibiotics. Our results show that, not only does ZINB generally identify most of the genes found by pairwise resampling (and vastly out-performs ANOVA), but it also identifies additional genes where variability is detectable only when the magnitudes of insertion counts are treated separately from local differences in saturation, as in the ZINB model.",

Studies suggest that TGP impacts population dynamics and evolution of phenotype, but these impacts will depend on how long an environmental effect can persist across generations and whether multigenerational effects are cumulative. Here we tested the impact of both grand-parental and parental environments on offspring reaction norm in a prey-predator system. We exposed three generations of Physa acuta snails without and with predator-cues according to a full factorial design and measured offspring inducible defenses. We found that both grand-parental and parental exposure to predator cues impacted offspring anti-predator defenses, but their effects were not cumulative and depended on the defenses considered. We also highlighted that grand-parental environment could alter reaction norm of offspring shell thickness, demonstrating an interaction between the grand-parental TGP and the within-generational WGP plasticity. We called for more studies covering the combine effects of multigenerational environments.",

    "abstract": "Gene transcription profiles across tissues are largely defined by the activity of regulatory elements, most of which correspond to regions of accessible chromatin. Regulatory element activity is in turn modulated by genetic variation, resulting in variable transcription rates across individuals. The interplay of these factors, however, is poorly understood. Here we characterize expression and chromatin state dynamics across three tissues--liver, lung, and kidney--in 47 strains of the Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse population, examining the regulation of these dynamics by expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and chromatin QTL (cQTL). QTL whose allelic effects were consistent across tissues were detected for 1,101 genes and 133 chromatin regions. Also detected were eQTL and cQTL whose allelic effects differed across tissues, including local-eQTL for Pik3c2g detected in all three tissues but with distinct allelic effects. Leveraging overlapping measurements of gene expression and chromatin accessibility on the same mice from multiple tissues, we used mediation analysis to identify chromatin and gene expression intermediates of eQTL effects. Based on QTL and mediation analyses over multiple tissues, we propose a causal model for the distal genetic regulation of Akr1e1, a gene involved in glycogen metabolism, through the zinc finger transcription factor Zfp985 and chromatin intermediates. This analysis demonstrates the complexity of transcriptional and chromatin dynamics and their regulation over multiple tissues, as well as the value of the CC and related genetic resource populations for identifying specific regulatory mechanisms within cells and tissues.\\n\\nAuthor summaryGenetic variation can drive alterations in gene expression levels and chromatin accessibility, the latter of which defines gene regulatory elements genome-wide. The same genetic variants may associate with both molecular events, and these may be connected within the same causal path: a variant that reduces promoter region chromatin accessibility, potentially by affecting transcription factor binding, may lead to reduced expression of that gene. Moreover, these causal regulatory paths can differ between tissues depending on functions and cellular activity specific to each tissue. We identify cross-tissue and tissue-selective genetic regulators of gene expression and chromatin accessibility in liver, lung, and kidney tissues using a panel of genetically diverse inbred mouse strains. Further, we identify a number of candidate causal mediators of the genetic regulation of gene expression, including a zinc finger protein that helps silence the Akr1e1 gene. Our analyses are consistent with chromatin accessibility playing a role in the regulation of transcription. Our study demonstrates the power of genetically diverse, multi-parental mouse populations, such as the Collaborative Cross, for large-scale studies of genetic drivers of gene regulation that underlie complex phenotypes, as well as identifying causal intermediates that drive variable activity of specific genes and pathways.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive behavior in even the simplest decision-making tasks requires predicting future events in an environment that is generally nonstationary. As an inductive problem, this prediction requires a commitment to the statistical process underlying environmental change. This challenge can be formalized in a Bayesian framework as a question of choosing a generative model for the task dynamics. Previous learning models assume, implicitly or explicitly, that nonstationarity follows either a continuous diffusion process or a discrete changepoint process. Each approach is slow to adapt when its assumptions are violated. A new mixture of Bayesian experts framework proposes separable brain systems approximating inference under different assumptions regarding the statistical structure of the environment. This model explains data from a laboratory foraging task, in which rats experienced a change in reward contingencies after pharmacological disruption of dorsolateral (DLS) or dorsomedial striatum (DMS). The data and model suggest DLS learns under a diffusion prior whereas DMS learns under a changepoint prior. The combination of these two systems offers a new explanation for how the brain handles inference in an uncertain environment.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryAdaptive foraging behavior can be explained by separable brain systems approximating Bayesian inference under different assumptions about dynamics of the environment.",

    "abstract": "1) Humans exert dramatic influences upon the environment, creating novel selective pressures to which organisms must adapt. On the Galapagos, humans have established a permanent presence and have altered selective pressures through influences such as invasive predators and urbanization, affecting iconic species such as Darwins finches.\\n\\n2) Here, I ask two key questions: (i) does antipredator behaviour (e.g. FID) change depending on whether invasive predators are historically absent, present, or eradicated? and (ii) to what degree does urbanization affect antipredator behaviour? This study is one of the first to quantify antipredator behaviour in endemic species after the eradication of invasive predators. This will help to understand the consequences of invasive predator eradication and inform conservation measures.\\n\\n3) I quantified flight initiation distance (FID), an antipredator behaviour, in Darwins finches, across multiple islands in the Galapagos that varied in the presence, absence, or successful eradication of invasive predators. On islands with human populations, I quantified FID in urban and non-urban populations of finches.\\n\\n4) FID was higher on islands with invasive predators compared to islands with no predators. On islands from which invasive predators were eradicated [~]11 years previously, FID was also higher than on islands with no invasive predators. Within islands that had both urban and non-urban populations of finches, FID was lower in urban finch populations, but only above a threshold human population size. FID in larger urban areas on islands with invasive predators was similar to or lower than FID on islands with no history of invasive predators.\\n\\n5) Overall, these results suggest that invasive predators can have a lasting effect on antipredator behaviour, even after eradication. Furthermore, the effect of urbanization can strongly oppose the effect of invasive predators, reducing antipredator behaviour to levels lower than found on pristine islands with no human influences. These results improve our understanding of human influences on antipredator behaviour which can help inform future conservation and management efforts on islands.",

The first version of CANDO implemented a structure-based pipeline that modeled interactions between compounds and proteins on a large scale, generating compoundproteome interaction signatures used to infer similarity of drug behavior; the new pipelines accomplish this by incorporating molecular fingerprints and the Tanimoto coefficient. We obtain improved benchmarking performance with the new pipelines across all three evaluation metrics used: average indication accuracy, pairwise accuracy, and coverage. The best performing pipeline achieves an average indication accuracy of 19.0% at the top10 cutoff, compared to 11.7% for v1, and 2.2% for a random control. Our results demonstrate that the CANDO drug recovery accuracy is substantially improved by integrating multiple pipelines, thereby enhancing our ability to generate putative therapeutic repurposing candidates, and increasing drug discovery efficiency.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been increased interest in studying cancer by using algorithmic methods to infer the evolutionary tree underlying a tumors developmental history. Quantitative measures that compare such trees are then vital to benchmarking these algorithmic tree inference methods, understanding the structure of the space of possible trees for a given dataset, and clustering together similar trees in order to evaluate inheritance patterns. However, few appropriate distance measures exist, and those that do exist have low resolution for differentiating trees or do not fully account for the complex relationship between tree topology and how the mutations that label that topology are inherited. Here we present two novel distance measures, Common Ancestor Set distance (CASet) and Distinctly Inherited Set Comparison distance (DISC), that are specifically designed to account for the subclonal mutation inheritance patterns characteristic of tumor evolutionary trees. We apply CASet and DISC to two simulated and two breast cancer datasets and show that our distance measures allow for more nuanced and accurate delineation between tumor evolutionary trees than existing distance measures.

    "abstract": "Lipid membrane packing defects are considered as essential parameter that regulates specific membrane binding of several peripheral proteins. In absence of direct experimental characterization, lipid packing defects and their role in the binding of peripheral proteins are generally investigated through computational studies, which have been immensely successful in unraveling the key steps of the membrane-binding process. However, packing defects are calculated using 2-dimensional projections and the crucial information on their depths is generally overlooked. Here we present a simple yet computationally efficient algorithm, which identifies these defects in 3-dimensions. We employ the algorithm to understand the nature of packing defects in flat bilayer membranes exhibiting liquid-ordered (Lo), liquid-disordered (Ld) and co-existing Lo/Ld phases. Our results indicate the presence of shallower and smaller defects in the Lo phase membranes as compared to the defects in Ld and mixed Lo/Ld phase membranes. Such analyses can elucidate the molecular scale mechanisms that drive the preferential localization of certain proteins to either of the liquid phases or their interface. Moreover, on the methodology front, our analyses suggest that the projection based 2-dimensional calculation of packing defects might result in inaccurate quantification of their sizes - a very important feature for membrane association of protein motifs, thus advocating the importance of the 3-dimensional calculations.",

However, such methods have the potential to be confounded by features of demographic history, such as population size and migration, which are considerably varied across natural populations. In this study, we use forward-simulations to investigate and illustrate how several measures of genetic differentiation commonly used in outlier scans (FST, DXY and {Delta}{pi}) are influenced by demographic variation across multiple sampling generations. In a factorial design with 16 treatments, we manipulate the presence/absence of founding bottlenecks (N of founding individuals), protracted bottlenecks (proportional size of diverging population) and migration rate between two populations with ancestral and derived phenotypic optima. Our results illustrate known constraints of individual measures associated with reduced population size and a lack of migration; but notably we demonstrate how relationships between measures are similarly dependent on demography. We find that false-positive signals of convergent evolution (the same simulated outliers detected in independent treatments) are attainable as a product of similar demographic treatment, and that outliers across different measures (particularly FST and DXY) can occur with little influence of selection. Taken together, we show how underappreciated, yet quantifiable measures of demographic history can influence commonly employed methods for detecting selection.",

We had previously observed that infarct volume is inversely correlated with cerebral collateral vessel density in the strains. In this study, we expanded the pool of allelic variation among classical inbred mouse strains by utilizing the eight founder strains of the Collaborative Cross and found a wild-derived strain, WSB/EiJ, that breaks this general rule that collateral vessel density inversely correlates with infarct volume. WSB/EiJ and another wild-derived strain, CAST/EiJ, show the highest collateral vessel densities of any inbred strain, but infarct volume of WSB/EiJ mice is 8.7-fold larger than that of CAST/EiJ mice. QTL mapping between these strains identified four new neuroprotective loci modulating cerebral infarct volume while not affecting collateral vessel phenotypes. To identify causative variants in genes we surveyed non-synonymous coding SNPs between CAST/EiJ and WSB/EiJ and found 96 genes harboring coding SNPs predicted to be damaging and mapping within one of the four intervals. In addition, we performed RNA sequencing for brain tissue of CAST/EiJ and WSB/EiJ mice and identified 79 candidate genes mapping in one of the four intervals showing strain-specific differences in expression. The identification of the genes underlying these neuroprotective loci will provide new understanding of genetic risk factors of ischemic stroke which may provide novel targets for future therapeutic intervention of human ischemic stroke.",

Here, using the fish pathogen Flavobacterium columnare and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), we show that phages infecting the pathogen are capable of binding to primary mucus layers and protecting fish from infections. Furthermore, exposure to mucus changes the bacterial phenotype by increasing bacterial virulence and susceptibility to phage infections. Tests using other phage-bacterium pairs suggest that the relevance of mucus for bacteria and phages may be widespread in the biosphere. Therefore, interactions of bacteria and phages inside the mucus environment may be important for disease and evolution, and this phenomenon has significant potential to be exploited for preventive phage therapy approaches.",

Furthermore, the two motives involve distinct brain networks: the LPFC tracked potential value to self, whereas the rTPJ tracked potential losses to other, and individual differences in motives modulated these neural responses. Finally, activity in the vmPFC represented a balance of the two motives unique to each participant. Taken together, our results suggest that (dis)honest decisions incorporate at least two separate cognitive and neural processes - valuation of potential profits to self and valuation of potential harm to others.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have generated an increasing number of common genetic variants that affect neurological and psychiatric disease risk. Given that many causal variants are likely to operate by regulating gene expression, an improved understanding of the genetic control of gene expression in human brain is vital. However, the difficulties of sampling human brain, and its complexity, has meant that brain-related expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and allele specific expression (ASE) signals have been more limited in their explanatory power than might otherwise be expected. To address this, we use paired genomic and transcriptomic data from putamen and substantia nigra dissected from 117 brains, combined with a comprehensive set of analyses, to interrogate regulation at different stages of RNA processing and uncover novel transcripts. We identify disease-relevant regulatory loci and reveal the types of analyses and regulatory positions yielding the most disease-specific information. We find that splicing eQTLs are enriched for neuron-specific regulatory information; that ASE analyses provide highly cell-specific regulatory information; and that incomplete annotation of the brain transcriptome limits the interpretation of risk loci for neuropsychiatric disease. We release this rich resource of regulatory data through a searchable webserver, http://braineacv2.inf.um.es/.",

Although the core components have been identified, how they cooperate to achieve high fidelity in centriole duplication remains poorly understood. Here, we show that in centriole duplication the accumulation of STIL and HsSAS6, components of the cartwheel structure, provides negative feedback in the centriolar dynamics of Plk4. By live-cell imaging of endogenously tagged proteins in human cells throughout the entire cell cycle, we quantitatively tracked the dynamics of the critical duplication factors: Plk4, STIL, and HsSAS6. Centriolar Plk4 peaks and then starts decreasing during the late G1 phase, which coincides with the accumulation of STIL at centrioles. Shortly thereafter, the HsSAS6 level increases steeply at the procentriole assembly site. We also show that both STIL and HsSAS6 are necessary for attenuating Plk4 levels. Furthermore, our mathematical modeling and simulation convincingly reproduce the dynamics of these three proteins at centrioles, and suggest that the STIL-HsSAS6 complex in the cartwheel has a negative feedback effect on centriolar Plk4. Combined, these findings illustrate how the dynamic behavior of and interactions between the critical duplication factors coordinate the centriole-duplication process.",

    "abstract": "The circadian clock is an endogenous oscillator that controls daily rhythms in metabolism, physiology and behavior. Although the timekeeping components differ among species, a common design principle is a transcription-translation negative feedback loop. However, it is becoming clear that other mechanisms can contribute to the generation of 24 h rhythms. In mammalian adrenal gland, heart and brown adipose tissue, peroxiredoxins (Prx) exhibit 24 h rhythms in their redox state. Such rhythms are generated as a result of an inactivating hyperoxidation reaction that is reduced by coordinated import of the sulfiredoxin (Srx) into the mitochondria. However, a quantitative description of the Prx/Srx oscillating system is still missing. We investigate the basic principles that generate mitochondrial Prx/Srx rhythms using computational modeling. We observe that the previously described delay in mitochondrial Srx import, in combination with an appropriate separation of fast and slow reactions is sufficient to generate robust self-sustained relaxation-like oscillations. We find that our conceptual model can be regarded as a series of three consecutive phases and two temporal switches, highlighting the importance of delayed negative feedback and switches in the generation of oscillations.",

Many neurons in the visual cortex of higher mammals are sensitive to binocular disparity, with distinct disparity tuning properties across primary and higher visual areas. Mouse primary visual cortex (V1) has been shown to contain disparity-tuned neurons, but it is unknown how these signals are processed beyond V1. We find that disparity signals are prominent in higher areas of mouse visual cortex. Preferred disparities markedly differ among visual areas, with area RL encoding visual stimuli very close to the mouse. Moreover, disparity preference is systematically related to visual field elevation, such that neurons with receptive fields in the lower visual field are overall tuned to near disparities, likely reflecting an adaptation to natural image statistics. Our results reveal ecologically relevant areal specializations for binocular disparity processing across mouse visual cortex.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveHigh-throughput electronic phenotyping algorithms can accelerate translational research using data from electronic health record (EHR) systems. The temporal information buried in EHRs are often underutilized in developing computational phenotypic definitions. The objective of this study is to develop a high-throughput phenotyping method, leveraging temporal sequential patterns of discrete events from electronic health records.\n\nMaterials and MethodsWe develop a representation mining algorithm to extract five classes of representations from EHR diagnosis and medication records: the aggregated vector of the records (AVR), the traditional immediate sequential patterns (SPM), the transitive sequential patterns (tSPM), as well as two hybrid classes of SPM+AVR and tSPM+AVR. A final small set of representations were selected from each class using the MSMR dimensionality reduction algorithm. Using EHR data on 10 phenotypes from Mass General Brigham Biobank, we trained regularized logistic regression algorithms, which we validated using labeled data.\n\nResultsPhenotyping with temporal sequences resulted in a superior classification performance across all 10 phenotypes compared with the AVR representations that are conventionally used in electronic phenotyping. Although this study only utilizes the diagnosis and medication records, the high-throughput algorithms classification performance was superior or similar to the performance of previously published electronic phenotyping algorithms. We characterize and evaluate the top transitive sequences of diagnosis records paired with the records of risk factors, symptoms, complications, medications, or vaccinations.\n\nDiscussionThe proposed high-throughput phenotyping approach enables seamless discovery of sequential record combinations that may be difficult to assume from raw EHR data. A transitive sequence can offer a more accurate characterization of the phenotype, compared with its individual components. Additionally, the identified transitive sequences of a given phenotype reflect the actual lived experiences of the patients with that particular disease.\n\nConclusionSequential data representations provide a precise mechanism for incorporating raw EHR records into downstream Machine Learning.",

    "abstract": "Chromosomal aberrations are common features of hematological malignancies, with several recurrent aberrations recognized as important diagnostic or prognostic molecular markers. While genome-wide genotyping and genomic hybridization microarray analyses have been implemented in clinical laboratories for several years the usage of next generation sequencing for detection of acquired copy number alterations has not yet reached full clinical integration. One evident problem is the identification of copy neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LoH), which is not detectable by sequencing read depth correlation or the analogous microarray CGH. We selected 23 paired samples of hematological disorders from 14 individuals, focusing on leukemia and lymphomas, and tested whether a low complexity approach, relying on Fishers exact test or {chi}2, is efficient for the analysis of variant allele frequencies with read-depth ratio correlations in order to resolve both copy-altering and neutral chromosomal aberrations. This combination helped to identify 69 altered chromosomes and offered mutual confirmation. Moreover, six CN-LoHs (>1% AF shifts, p<0.01) were found with one additional suspected low frequency deletion (~10-15% burden) in a case of CLL. We conclude that this simple method is directly clinically applicable for the detection of copy neutral chromosomal loss of single genes from WES with intermediate coverage.\\n\\nAvailabilityMentioned plot software is available at Harvard Dataverse http://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/KFMGNY\\n\\nContactMarcus.celik.hansen@rsyd.dk or marcus@clin.au.dk\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary plots are available",

Weekly surveillance data of MSSA carriage among neonates and cross-sectional screenings of health care workers (HCWs) were available for outbreak tracing. While traditional typing of MSSA isolates by staphylococcal protein A gene (spa typing) and Multiple-Locus Variable number tandem repeat Analysis (MLVA) suggested that nosocomial transmission had contributed to the infections, here they lacked the resolution to draw solid conclusions.\\n\\nMethodsMSSA isolates from neonatal infections, carriage surveillance, and HCWs were subjected to whole-genome sequencing and compared by a series of automated tools including de novo assembly, identification and localization of high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms, and in-depth analysis of subsets of isolates. Outbreaks were defined as isolates that were more closely related than was to be expected from the genetic diversity in background surveillance.\\n\\nResultsGenomic analysis identified isolates that had been unjustly assigned to clusters based on MLVA typing, while spa typing was concordant but of insufficient resolution. Detailing particular subsets of isolates further improved resolution and although it provided evidence that HCWs were involved in multiple outbreaks, it alleviated heavy concerns about one particular HCW. Genomic clustering of isolates based on deviations from background surveillance matched epidemiological patient linkage. Compared to MLVA typing, the genomic analysis demonstrated more, shorter, and re-assorted nosocomial transmission chains during this outbreak.\\n\\nConclusionsIn this study the improved resolution and accuracy of genomic outbreak analyses compared to spa typing and MLVA substantially altered the view on outbreaks, along with apposite outbreak measures.

    "abstract": "Coordinated brain activity reflects underlying cognitive processes and can be modeled as a network of inter-regional functional connections. The most costly connections in the network are long-distance correlations that, in the absence of underlying structural connections, are maintained by sustained energetic inputs. Here, we present a spatial modeling approach that amplifies contributions made by long-distance functional connections to whole-brain network architecture, while simultaneously suppressing contributions made by short-range connections. We use this method to characterize the long-distance architecture of functional networks and to identify aspects of community and hub structure that are driven by long-distance correlations and that, we argue, are of greater functional significance. We find that based only on patterns of long-distance connectivity, primary sensory cortices occupy increasingly central positions and appear more \\\"hub-like\\\". Additionally, we show that the community structure of long-distance connections spans multiple topological levels and differs from the community structure detected in networks that include both short-range and long-distance connections. In summary, these findings highlight the complex relationship between the brains physical layout and its functional architecture. The results presented here inform future analyses of community structure and network hubs in health, across development, and in the case of neuropsychiatric disorders.",

Here, we track neural crest (NC) and ectodermal placode-derived progenitor movements in vivo, for hundreds of cells, implement unbiased algorithmic approaches to extract biologically meaningful information, and discover cell-cell and lineage-lineage coordination between progenitors that form olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) during zebrafish embryogenesis. Our approach discriminates between NC- and placode-derived contributions and segregates ingressing NC cells into two previously unidentified subtypes termed  trend and  dispersed lineages. Our analyses indicate that NC and placodal progenitor migration and intercalation are coordinated by at least two types of collective behavior: spatiotemporal exclusion and elastic tethering, akin to a push-pull mechanism. A stochastic equilibrium model accurately represents the interactions of NC and placode-derived lineages. Our approach provides insights into the coordination of dual-origin lineages during vertebrate olfactory neurogenesis and offers an algorithmic toolkit for probing multicellular coordination in vivo.\\n\\nO_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY Graphical Abstract C_FIG_DISPLAY",

Due to the quantitative limitations of existing methods, colour and pattern are rarely analysed in conjunction with one another, despite a large body of literature and decades of research on the importance of spatiochromatic colour pattern analyses. Furthermore, key physiological limitations of animal visual systems such as spatial acuity, spectral sensitivities, photoreceptor abundances and receptor noise levels are rarely considered together in colour pattern analyses.\\nC_LIO_LIHere, we present a novel analytical framework, called the  Quantitative Colour Pattern Analysis (QCPA). We have overcome many quantitative and qualitative limitations of existing colour pattern analyses by combining calibrated digital photography and visual modelling. We have integrated and updated existing spatiochromatic colour pattern analyses, including adjacency, visual contrast and boundary strength analysis, to be implemented using calibrated digital photography through the  Multispectral Image Analysis and Calibration (MICA) Toolbox.\\nC_LIO_LIThis combination of calibrated photography and spatiochromatic colour pattern analyses is enabled by the inclusion of psychophysical colour and luminance discrimination thresholds for image segmentation, which we call  Receptor Noise Limited Clustering, used here for the first time. Furthermore, QCPA provides a novel psycho-physiological approach to the modelling of spatial acuity using convolution in the spatial or frequency domains, followed by  Receptor Noise Limited Ranked Filtering to eliminate intermediate edge artefacts and recover sharp boundaries following smoothing. We also present a new type of colour pattern analysis, the  Local Edge Intensity Analysis (LEIA) as well as a range of novel psycho-physiological approaches to the visualisation of spatiochromatic data.\\nC_LIO_LIQCPA combines novel and existing pattern analysis frameworks into what we hope is a unified, user-friendly, free and open source toolbox and introduce a range of novel analytical and data-visualisation approaches. These analyses and tools have been seamlessly integrated into the MICA toolbox providing a dynamic and user-friendly workflow.\\nC_LIO_LIQCPA is a framework for the empirical investigation of key theories underlying the design, function and evolution of colour patterns in nature. We believe that it is compatible with, but more thorough than, other existing colour pattern analyses.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "MotivationChromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), initially introduced more than a decade ago, is widely used by the scientific community to detect protein/DNA binding and histone modifications across the genome. Every experiment is prone to noise and bias, and ChIP-seq experiments are no exception. To alleviate bias, the incorporation of control datasets in ChIP-seq analysis is an essential step. The controls are used to account for the background signal, while the remainder of the ChIP-seq signal captures true binding or histone modification. However, a recurrent issue is different types of bias in different ChIP-seq experiments. Depending on which controls are used, different aspects of ChIP-seq bias are better or worse accounted for, and peak calling can produce different results for the same ChIP-seq experiment. Consequently, generating \"smart\" controls, which model the non-signal effect for a specific ChIP-seq experiment, could enhance contrast and increase the reliability and reproducibility of the results.\n\nResultsWe propose a peak calling algorithm, Weighted Analysis of ChIP-seq (WACS), which is an extension of the well-known peak caller MACS2. There are two main steps in WACS: First, weights are estimated for each control using non-negative least squares regression. The goal is to customize controls to model the noise distribution for each ChIP-seq experiment. This is then followed by peak calling. We demonstrate that WACS significantly outperforms MACS2 and AIControl, another recent algorithm for generating smart controls, in the detection of enriched regions along the genome, in terms of motif enrichment and reproducibility analyses.\n\nConclusionThis ultimately improves our understanding of ChIP-seq controls and their biases, and shows that WACS results in a better approximation of the noise distribution in controls.",

    "abstract": "MotivationChromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), initially introduced more than a decade ago, is widely used by the scientific community to detect protein/DNA binding and histone modifications across the genome. Every experiment is prone to noise and bias, and ChIP-seq experiments are no exception. To alleviate bias, the incorporation of control datasets in ChIP-seq analysis is an essential step. The controls are used to account for the background signal, while the remainder of the ChIP-seq signal captures true binding or histone modification. However, a recurrent issue is different types of bias in different ChIP-seq experiments. Depending on which controls are used, different aspects of ChIP-seq bias are better or worse accounted for, and peak calling can produce different results for the same ChIP-seq experiment. Consequently, generating \"smart\" controls, which model the non-signal effect for a specific ChIP-seq experiment, could enhance contrast and increase the reliability and reproducibility of the results.\n\nResultsWe propose a peak calling algorithm, Weighted Analysis of ChIP-seq (WACS), which is an extension of the well-known peak caller MACS2. There are two main steps in WACS: First, weights are estimated for each control using non-negative least squares regression. The goal is to customize controls to model the noise distribution for each ChIP-seq experiment. This is then followed by peak calling. We demonstrate that WACS significantly outperforms MACS2 and AIControl, another recent algorithm for generating smart controls, in the detection of enriched regions along the genome, in terms of motif enrichment and reproducibility analyses.\n\nConclusionThis ultimately improves our understanding of ChIP-seq controls and their biases, and shows that WACS results in a better approximation of the noise distribution in controls.",

    "abstract": "Human stem cell-derived organoids have great potential for modelling physiological and pathological processes. They recapitulate in vitro the organisation and function of a respective organ or part of an organ. Human midbrain organoids (hMOs) have been described to contain midbrain-specific dopaminergic neurons that release the neurotransmitter dopamine. However, the human midbrain contains also additional neuronal cell types, which are functionally interacting with each other. Here, we analysed hMOs at high-resolution by means of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), imaging and electrophysiology to unravel cell heterogeneity. Our findings demonstrate that hMOs show essential neuronal functional properties as spontaneous electrophysiological activity of different neuronal subtypes, including dopaminergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic neurons. Recapitulating these in vivo features makes hMOs an excellent tool for in vitro disease phenotyping and drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Socio-economic disadvantage (SED) increases exposure to life stressors. Animal research suggests early life stressors affect later neurodevelopment, including myelin developmental growth. To determine whether human childhood SED affects myelination in adolescence and early adulthood we measured the developmental increase of a sensitive myelin marker, magnetization transfer (MT), in a longitudinal study. Childhood SED was associated with globally reduced MT, as well as slower intra-cortical MT increase in widespread sensory-motor, cingulate, insular and prefrontal areas and subcortical areas. Parental education partially accounted for the SED effects on MT increase, while positive parenting provided a partial protection against the impact of SED. Thus, early socio-economic disadvantage, a vulnerability factor for a range of ill-health outcomes, is a risk factor for aberrant myelin growth during a critical developmental period that is associated with a high risk of psychiatric disorder.",

    "abstract": "A functional role of the cerebral cortex is to form and hold representations of the sensory world for behavioral purposes. This is achieved by a sheet of neurons, organized in modules called cortical columns, that receives inputs in a peculiar manner, with only a few neurons driven by sensory inputs through thalamic projections, and a vast majority of neurons receiving mainly cortical inputs. How should cortical modules be organized, with respect to sensory inputs, in order for the cortex to efficiently hold sensory representations in memory? To address this question we investigate the memory performance of trees of recurrent networks (TRN) that are composed of recurrent networks, modeling cortical columns, connected with each others through a tree-shaped feed-forward backbone of connections, with sensory stimuli injected at the root of the tree. On these sensory architectures two types of short-term memory (STM) mechanisms can be implemented, STM via transient dynamics on the feed-forward tree, and STM via reverberating activity on the recurrent connectivity inside modules. We derive equations describing the dynamics of such networks, which allow us to thoroughly explore the space of possible architectures and quantify their memory performance. By varying the divergence ratio of the tree, we show that serial architectures, where sensory inputs are successively processed in different modules, are better suited to implement STM via transient dynamics, while parallel architectures, where sensory inputs are simultaneously processed by all modules, are better suited to implement STM via reverberating dynamics.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is responsible for the bulk of protein degradation in eukaryotic cells, but the factors that cause different substrates to be unfolded and degraded to different extents are still poorly understood. We previously showed that polyubiquitinated substrates were degraded with greater processivity (with a higher tendency to be unfolded and degraded than released) than ubiquitin-independent substrates. Thus, even though ubiquitin chains are removed before unfolding and degradation occur, they affect the unfolding of a protein domain. How do ubiquitin chains activate the proteasomes unfolding ability? We investigated the roles of the three intrinsic proteasomal ubiquitin receptors - Rpn1, Rpn10 and Rpn13 - in this activation. We find that these receptors are required for substrate-mediated activation of the proteasomes unfolding ability. Rpn13 plays the largest role, but there is also partial redundancy between receptors. The architecture of substrate ubiquitination determines which receptors are needed for maximal unfolding ability, and, in some cases, simultaneous engagement of ubiquitin by multiple receptors may be required. Our results suggest physical models for how ubiquitin receptors communicate with the proteasomal motor proteins.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic microbial consortia consist of two or more engineered strains that grow together and share the same resources. When intercellular signaling pathways are included in the engineered strains, close proximity of the microbes can generate complex dynamic behaviors that are difficult to obtain using a single strain. However, when a consortium is not cultured in a well-mixed environment the constituent strains passively compete for space as they grow and divide, complicating cell-cell signaling. Here, we explore the temporal dynamics of the spatial distribution of consortia co-cultured in microfluidic devices. To do this, we grew two different strains of Escherichia coli in microfluidic devices with cell-trapping regions (traps) of several different designs. We found that the size and shape of the traps are critical determinants of spatiotemporal dynamics. In small traps, cells can easily signal one another but the relative proportion of each strain within the trap can fluctuate wildly. In large traps, the relative ratio of strains is stabilized, but intercellular signaling can be hindered by distances between cells. This presents a trade-off between the trap size and the effectiveness of intercellular signaling, which can be mitigated by controlling the initial seeding of cells in the large trap. These results show how synthetic microbial consortia behave in microfluidic traps and provide a method to help remedy the spatial heterogeneity inherent to different trap geometries.",

    "abstract": "Worldwide, tea (Camellia sinensis) is the most consumed beverage primarily due to the taste, flavour and aroma of its newly formed leaves; and has been used as an important ingredient in several traditional medicinal systems because of its antioxidant properties. For this medicinally and commercially important plant, design principles of gene-regulatory and protein-protein interaction networks at sub-cellular level are largely un-characterized mainly because neither its reference assembly nor annotated genome is available though plenty of its transcriptomes have been studied. In this work, we report a tea leaf interologous PPI network (TeaLIPIN) consisting of 11,208 nodes and 1,97,820 interactions. A reference transcriptome assembly was first developed from all the 44 samples of 6 publicly available leaf transcriptomes (1,567,288,290 raw reads). By inferring the high-confidence interactions among potential proteins coded by these transcripts using known experimental information about PPIs in 14 plants, an interologous PPI network was constructed and its modular architecture was explored. Comparing this PPI network with 10,000 realisations of corresponding random networks (Erd[o]s-Renyi models) and examining over three network centrality metrics, we predict 2,931 bottleneck proteins (having p-values <0.01). 270 of these are deduced to have transcription factor domains by developing the HMM models of known plant TFs. Final transcripts were also mapped to the draft tea genome in order to search the probable loci of their origin. We believe that the proposed novel methodology can easily be adopted to develop and explore the PPI interactomes in other plant species by making use of the available transcriptomic data.",

Rather, our data show that EPS8 specifically functions during virion uncoating.

    "abstract": "While it has been known for several years that viral RNAs are subject to the addition of several distinct covalent modifications to individual nucleotides, collectively referred to as epitranscriptomic modifications, the effect of these editing events on viral gene expression has been controversial. Here, we report the purification of murine leukemia virus (MLV) genomic RNA to homogeneity and show that this viral RNA contains levels of N6-methyladenosine (m6A), 5-methylcytosine (m5C) and 2O-methylated (Nm) ribonucleotides that are an order of magnitude higher than detected on bulk cellular mRNAs. Mapping of m6A and m5C residues on MLV transcripts identified multiple discrete editing sites and allowed the construction of MLV variants bearing silent mutations that removed a subset of these sites. Analysis of the replication potential of these mutants revealed a modest but significant attenuation in viral replication in 3T3 cells in culture. Consistent with a positive role for m6A and m5C in viral replication, we also demonstrate that overexpression of the key m6A reader protein YTHDF2 enhances MLV replication, while downregulation of the m5C writer NSUN2 inhibits MLV replication.\\n\\nImportanceThe data presented in this manuscript demonstrate that MLV RNAs bear an exceptionally high level of the epitranscriptomic modifications m6A, m5C and Nm, thus suggesting that these each facilitate some aspect of the viral replication cycle. Consistent with this hypothesis, we demonstrate that mutational removal of a subset of these m6A or m5C modifications from MLV transcripts inhibits MLV replication in cis and a similar result was also observed upon manipulation of the level of expression of key cellular epitranscriptomic cofactors in trans. Together, these results argue that the addition of several different epitranscriptomic modifications to viral transcripts stimulates viral gene expression and suggest that MLV has therefore evolved to maximize the level of these modifications that are added to viral RNAs.",

    "abstract": "Leishmania parasite infections, termed the leishmaniases, cause significant global infectious disease burden. The lifecycle of the parasite embodies three main stages that require precise coordination of gene regulation to survive environmental shifts between sandfly and mammalian hosts. Constitutive transcription in kinetoplastid parasites means that gene regulation is overwhelmingly reliant on post-transcriptional mechanisms, yet strikingly few Leishmania trans-regulators are known. Utilizing optimised crosslinking and deep, quantified mass spectrometry, we present a comprehensive analysis of 1,400 mRNA binding proteins (mRBPs) and whole cell proteomes from the three main Leishmania lifecycle stages. Supporting the validity, while the crosslinked RBPome is magnitudes more enriched the protein identities of the crosslinked and non-crosslinked RBPomes were nearly identical. Moreover, multiple candidate RBPs were endogenously tagged and found to associate with discrete mRNA target pools in a stage-specific manner. Results indicate that in L.mexicana parasites, mRNA levels are not a strong predictor of the whole cell expression or RNA binding potential of encoded proteins. Evidence includes a low correlation between transcript and corresponding protein expression and stage-specific variation in protein expression versus RNA binding potential. Unsurprisingly, RNA binding protein enrichment correlates strongly with relative replication efficiency of the specific lifecycle stage. Our study is the first to quantitatively define and compare the mRBPome of multiple stages in kinetoplastid parasites. It provides novel, in-depth insight into the trans-regulatory mRNA:Protein (mRNP) complexes that drive Leishmania parasite lifecycle progression.",

We compared the across-session test-retest reproducibility error from these normalization approaches for FA and MD in white and gray matters.\n\nStatistical TestsReproducibility errors were compared using a repeated-measures analysis of variance with pipeline as within-subject factor.\n\nResultsThe registration of FA data to the FMRIB58 FA atlas using ANTs yielded lower reproducibility errors in white matter (p<0.0001) with respect to FSL. Moreover, using the MNI152 T1 template as the target of registration resulted in lower reproducibility errors for MD (p<0.0001), whereas the FMRIB58 FA template performed better for FA (p<0.0001).

Chromosomal length correlated with the amount of phenotypic variance captured, r[~]0.64 on average, suggesting that at a global scale causal variants are homogeneously distributed across the genome. At a local scale, SNPs within genes ([~]51%) captured [~]1.5 times more genetic variance than the rest; and SNPs with low minor allele frequency (MAF) captured less variance than the rest: the 40% of SNPs with MAF<5% captured <1/4th of the genetic variance. We also observed extensive pleiotropy across regions, with an average genetic correlation of rG[~]0.45. Genetic correlations were similar to phenotypic and environmental correlations, however, genetic correlations were often larger than phenotypic correlations for the left/right volumes of the same region. The heritability of differences in left/right volumes was generally not statistically significant, suggesting an important influence of environmental causes in the variability of brain asymmetry.

    "abstract": "BackgroundCurrent treatments for depression are limited by suboptimal efficacy, delayed response, and frequent side effects. Intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation treatment that is FDA-approved for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Recent methodological advancements suggest iTBS could be improved through 1) treating with multiple sessions per day at optimally-spaced intervals, 2) applying a higher overall pulse-dose of stimulation and 3) precision targeting of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) to subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) circuit. We examined the feasibility, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of an accelerated, high-dose, resting-state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI)-guided iTBS protocol for TRD termed  Stanford Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy (SAINT).\n\nMethodsTwenty-one participants with TRD received open-label SAINT. FcMRI was used to individually target the region of L-DLPFC most anticorrelated with sgACC. Fifty iTBS sessions (1800 pulses per session, 50-minute inter-session interval) were delivered as 10 daily sessions over 5 consecutive days at 90% resting motor threshold (adjusted for cortical depth). Neuropsychological testing was conducted before and after SAINT.\n\nResultsNineteen of 21 participants (90.48%) met criteria for remission ([&le;]10 on the Montgomery-[A]sberg Depression Rating Scale) immediately after SAINT. Neuropsychological testing demonstrated no negative cognitive side-effects. There were no seizures or other severe adverse events.\n\nDiscussionOur accelerated, high-dose, iTBS protocol with fcMRI-guided targeting (SAINT) was well tolerated and safe. Efficacy was strikingly high, especially for this treatment-resistant population. Double-blinded sham-controlled trials are required to confirm the high remission rate found in this initial study.\n\nTrial registrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT03240692",

    "abstract": "IMPORTANCEThe burden of dental caries in remote Indigenous communities in Australia is unacceptably high.\\n\\nOBJECTIVESWe tested the impact of an annual caries preventive intervention, delivered by a fly-in/fly-out professional team, on Indigenous children residing in a remote Australian community, involving selective fissure sealants, topical povidone iodine and fluoride varnish application. The outcome was caries increment at 12- and 24-month follow-up.\\n\\nDESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTSAround 600 Indigenous children aged 5 to 17 years were invited to participate at baseline, of which 408 had caregiver consent provided. Of these, 196 consented to both the study and the treatment arm and comprised the experimental group. Two hundred and twelve consented to the epidemiological examination only, and constituted the comparison group.\\n\\nINTERVENTIONThe  Big Bang intervention, which occurred annually, comprised placement of fissure sealants, and application of povidone-iodine and fluoride varnish, following completion of each childs dental treatment plan. Standard diet and oral hygiene advice was provided.\\n\\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURESCaries increment (number of tooth surfaces with new dental caries) in both primary and permanent dentitions at 12- and 24-month follow-up.\\n\\nRESULTSAt 12-month follow-up, children in the experimental group had, on average, 5.05 ({+/-}5.47) new carious lesions compared to 7.49 ({+/-}6.94) in the comparison group (p=0.001). The preventive fraction was 33%. At 24-month follow-up, children in the experimental group had, on average, 6.47 ({+/-}6.07) new carious lesions compared to 8.43 ({+/-}5.83) in the comparison group (p=0.002). The preventive fraction was 23%.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCEIndigenous children exposed to the  Big Bang caries intervention had significantly less increment in dental disease than those not exposed to the intervention. Benefits were demonstrated at both 12- and 24-month follow-ups, suggesting that the intervention is likely to be sustained if delivered across a childs life. The cost-effectiveness of this approach is being evaluated.\\n\\nQuestionDoes a quick, intensive,  Big Bang program of intervention reduce dental disease among remote Indigenous Australian children?\\n\\nFindingsAt 12- and 24-month follow-ups, children in the experimental group had fewer new caries surfaces. At the 24-month follow-up, the average caries increment was 6.47 ({+/-}6.07) in the experimental group compared to 8.43 ({+/-}5.83) in the comparison group; a preventive fraction of 23%.\\n\\nMeaningAn intensive caries intervention delivered by a peripatetic team of professionals, involving fissure sealants, topical povidone iodine and fluoride varnish application reduces experience of dental disease among this vulnerable population.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionMass deworming against soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) is a hallmark program in the neglected tropical diseases portfolio that is designed to be equitable and \\\"pro-poor\\\". However, the extent to which current deworming treatment programs achieve equitable coverage across wealth class and gender remains unclear, and the current public health metric of national deworming coverage does not include representation of inequity. This study develops a framework to measure both coverage and equity in global deworming to guide future programmatic evaluation, investment, and metric design.\\n\\nMethodsWe used nationally representative, geospatial household survey data that measured mother-reported deworming receipt in pre-school age children (age 1-4 years) in the previous 6 months. We estimated global deworming coverage disaggregated by geography, wealth quintile and gender and computed an equity index. We examined trends in coverage and equity index across countries, within countries, and over time. We used a regression model to compute the household correlates of deworming receipt and ecological correlates of equitable deworming.\\n\\nFindingsOur study included 820,883 pre-school age children living in 50 STH-endemic countries between 2004 and 2017. Globally, the mean global deworming coverage in pre-school children was estimated at 36%. The sub-national coverage ranged from 0.5% to 87.5%, and within-country variation was greater than between-country variation in coverage. The equity index was undesirable (deworming was consistently concentrated in the wealthier populations) in every endemic region of 12 countries. Of the 31 study countries that WHO reported achieving the goal of 75% national coverage, 26 had persistent inequity in deworming as defined by the mean equity index. Deworming equity modestly improved over time, and within-country variation in inequity decreased over time. We did not detect differences in deworming equity by gender. We found the strongest household correlates of deworming to be vitamin A supplementation and receipt of three doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine (DTP3), while the strongest ecological predictors of equitable deworming were regions with higher coverage of health services such as DTP3 and vitamin A supplementation.\\n\\nInterpretationAlthough mass deworming is considered to be \\\"pro-poor\\\", we find substantial inequities by wealth, despite often high reported national coverage. These inequities appear to be geographically heterogeneous, modestly improving over time, and we found no evidence of gender differences in inequity. Future reporting of deworming coverage should consider disaggregation by geography, wealth, and gender with incorporation of an equity index to complement national deworming coverage.\\n\\nFundingBill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Stanford University Medical Scientist Training Program",

    "abstract": "Estimates of the marginal effect of measures of adiposity such as body mass index (BMI) on healthcare costs are important for the formulation and evaluation of policies targeting adverse weight profiles. Many existing estimates of this association are affected by endogeneity bias caused by simultaneity, measurement error and omitted variables. The contribution of this study is to avoid this bias by using a novel identification strategy - random germline genetic variation in an instrumental variable analysis - to identify the presence and magnitude of the causal effect of BMI on inpatient hospital costs. We also use data on genetic variants to undertake much richer testing of the sensitivity of results to potential violations of the instrumental variable assumptions than is possible with existing approaches. Using data on over 300,000 individuals, we found effect sizes for the marginal unit of BMI more than 50% larger than multivariable effect sizes. These effects attenuated under sensitivity analyses, but remained larger than multivariable estimates for all but one estimator. There was little evidence for non-linear effects of BMI on hospital costs. Within-family estimates, intended to address dynastic biases, were null but suffered from low power. This paper is the first to use genetic variants in a Mendelian Randomization framework to estimate the causal effect of BMI (or any other disease/trait) on healthcare costs. This type of analysis can be used to inform the cost-effectiveness of interventions and policies targeting the prevention and treatment of overweight and obesity, and for setting research priorities.",

    "abstract": "Summary paragraphThe epidemiological transition from young to old deaths in high-income countries reduced mortality at all ages, but a major role was played by a decline of infant and child mortality from infectious diseases1,2 that greatly increased life expectancy at birth2,3. Over time, declines in infectious disease continue but chronic and degenerative causes persist4,5, so we might expect under-5 deaths to be concentrated in the first month of life. However, little is known about the age-pattern of this transition in early mortality or its potential limits. Here we first describe the limit using detailed data on Denmark, Japan, France, and the USA-- developed countries with low under-5 mortality. The limiting pattern of under-5 deaths concentrates in the first month, but is surprisingly dispersed over later ages: we call this the early rectangularization of mortality. Then we examine the progress towards this limit of 31 developing countries from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)--the region with the highest under-5 mortality6. In these countries, we find that early deaths have large age-heterogeneities; and that the age patterns of death is an important marker of progress in the mortality transition at early ages. But a negative association between national income and under-5 mortality levels, confirmed here, does not help explain reductions in child mortality during the transition.",

    "abstract": "Non-human animal models have demonstrated that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can enhance plasticity within the mature visual cortex and enable recovery from amblyopia. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the SSRI citalopram combined with part-time patching of the fellow fixing eye would improve amblyopic eye visual acuity in adult humans. Following a cross-over, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled design (pre-registration: ACTRN12611000669998), participants completed two 2-week blocks of fellow fixing eye patching. One block combined patching with citalopram (20 mg/day) and the other with a placebo tablet. The blocks were separated by a 2-week washout period. The primary outcome was change in amblyopic eye visual acuity. Secondary outcomes included stereoacuity and electrophysiological measures of retinal and cortical function. Seven participants were randomized, fewer than our pre-specified sample size of 20. There were no statistically significant differences in amblyopic eye visual acuity change between the active (mean {+/-} SD change = 0.08{+/-}0.16 logMAR) and the placebo (mean change = -0.01{+/-}0.03 logMAR) blocks. No treatment effects were observed for any secondary outcomes. However, 3 of 7 participants experienced a 0.1 logMAR or greater improvement in amblyopic eye visual acuity in the active but not the placebo block. These results from a small sample suggest that larger-scale trials of SSRI treatment for adult amblyopia may be warranted. Considerations for future trials include drug dose, treatment duration and recruitment challenges.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundScabies is a WHO neglected tropical disease common in children in low-and middle-income countries. Excoriation of scabies lesions can lead to secondary pyoderma infection, most commonly by Staphyloccocus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus, GAS), with the latter linked to acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) and potentially rheumatic heart disease (RHD). There is a paucity of data on the prevalence of these skin infections and their bacterial aetiology from Africa.\\n\\nMaterials/methodsA cross-sectional study, conducted over a four-month period that included the dry and rainy season, was conducted to determine the prevalence of common skin infections in Sukuta, a peri-urban settlement in western Gambia, in children <5 years. Swabs from pyoderma lesions were cultured for S. aureus and GAS.\\n\\nResultsOf 1441 children examined, 15.9% had scabies (95% CI 12.2-20.4), 17.4% had pyoderma (95% CI 10.4-27.7) and 9.7% had fungal infections (95% CI 6.6-14.0). Scabies were significantly associated with pyoderma (aOR 2.74, 95% CI 1.61-4.67). Of 250 pyoderma swabs, 80.8% were culture-positive for S. aureus, and 50.8% for GAS. Participants examined after the first rains were significantly more likely to have pyoderma than those examined before (aRR 2.42, 95% CI 1.38-4.23), whereas no difference in scabies prevalence was seen (aRR 1.08, 95% CI 0.70-1.67). Swab positivity was not affected by the season.\\n\\nConclusionsHigh prevalence of scabies and pyoderma were observed. Pyoderma increased significantly during rainy season. Given the high prevalence of GAS pyoderma among children, further research on the association with RHD in West Africa is warranted.\\n\\nSummaryThis cross-sectional study of skin infections in The Gambia revealed prevalence of scabies, pyoderma and fungal infections in children <5 years of 15.9%, 17.4% and 9.7% respectively, with increased bacterial skin infections in the rainy season.",

In the case of life expectancy at younger ages, most countries are moving in the same direction, but we observe significant cross-country variation for older adults and the elderly. Further, we observe increasing variance in life expectancy for older adults and elderly across countries. Increasing global heterogeneity in survival experience of older adults and the elderly population thus has remained a neglected aspect in the discussions on global life expectancy improvements.

We chose dietary macronutrients - carbohydrate, protein, fats, fiber, sugars & physical activity variables - energy expended from mild, moderate and vigorous intensity activity h/wk to predict current body weight either numerically (as kg of body weight) or categorically (as BMI categories). Several machine-learning tools were used for this prediction - k-nearest neighbors (kNN), decision trees, neural networks (NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) regressions and Random Forest. Further, predictive ability was refined using cluster analysis, in an effort to identify putative phenotypes.\\n\\nResultsFor the numerical predictions, kNN performed best (Mean Approximate Error (MAE) of 2.71kg, R2 of 0.92, Root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.96kg). For categorical prediction, ensemble trees (with nearest neighbor learner) performed best (93.8% accuracy). K-means cluster analysis identified 11 clusters suggestive of phenotypes, based on significantly improved predictive accuracy. Within clusters, individual macronutrient gain and loss modeling identified that some clusters were strongly predicted by dietary carbohydrate while others by dietary fat.\\n\\nConclusionsMachine-learning tools in nutritional epidemiology could be used to identify putative phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) has proven its potential to propagate across local and international borders on numerous occasions, but yet details about the directionality of the spread along with the role of the different host in transmission remain unexplored. To elucidate FMDV global spread characteristics, we studied the spatiotemporal phylodynamics of serotypes O, A, Asia1, SAT1, SAT2, and SAT3, based on more than 50 years of phylogenetic and epidemiological information. Our results revealed phylogeographic patterns, dispersal rates, and the role of host species in the dispersal and maintenance of virus circulation. Contrary to previous studies, our results showed that three serotypes were monophyletic (O, A, and Asia1), while all SATs serotypes did not evidence a defined common ancestor. Root state posterior probability (RSPP) analysis suggested Belgium as the country of origin for serotype O (RSPP=0.27). India was the ancestral country for serotypes A (RSPP= 0.28), and Asia-1 (RSPP= 0.34), while Uganda appeared as the most likely origin country of all SAT serotypes (RSPP> 0.45). Furthermore, we identified the key centers of dispersal of the virus, being China, India and Uganda the most important ones. Bayes factor analysis revealed cattle as the major source of the virus for most of the serotypes (RSPP> 0.63), where the most important host-species transition route for serotypes O, A, and Asia1 was from cattle Bos taurus to swine Sus scrofa domesticus (BF>500), while, for SAT serotypes was from B. taurus to African buffalo Syncerus caffer. This study provides significant insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of the global circulation of FMDV serotypes, by characterizing the viral routes of spread at serotype level, especially uncovering the importance of host species for each serotype in the evolution and spread of FMDV which further improve future decisions for more efficient control and eradication.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological models are routinely used to predict the effects of interventions aimed at reducing the impacts of Ebola epidemics. Most models of interventions targeting symptomatic hosts, such as isolation or treatment, assume that all symptomatic hosts are equally likely to be detected. In other words, following an incubation period, the level of symptoms displayed by an individual host is assumed to remain constant throughout an infection. In reality, however, symptoms vary between different stages of infection. During an Ebola infection, individuals progress from initial non-specific symptoms through to more severe phases of infection. Here we compare predictions of a model in which a constant symptoms level is assumed to those generated by a more epidemiologically realistic model that accounts for varying symptoms during infection. Both models can reproduce observed epidemic data, as we show by fitting the models to data from the ongoing epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the 2014-16 epidemic in Liberia. However, for both of these epidemics, when interventions are altered identically in the models with and without levels of symptoms that depend on the time since first infection, predictions from the models differ. Our work highlights the need to consider whether or not varying symptoms should be accounted for in models used by decision makers to assess the likely efficacy of Ebola interventions.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionIndividuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) or the APOL1 high-risk genotype (APOL1) are at increased risk of rapid kidney function decline (RKFD) as compared to the general population. Plasma biomarkers representing inflammatory and kidney injury pathways have been validated as predictive of kidney disease progression in several studies. In addition, routine clinical data in the electronic health record (EHR) may also be utilized for predictive purposes. The application of machine learning to integrate biomarkers with clinical data may lead to improved identification of RKFD.\\n\\nMethodsWe selected two subpopulations of high-risk individuals: T2DM (n=871) and APOL1 high risk genotype of African Ancestry (n=498), with a baseline eGFR [&ge;] 45 ml/min/1.73 m2 from the Mount Sinai BioMe Biobank. Plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor 1/2 (TNFR1/2), and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) were measured and a series of supervised machine learning approaches including random forest (RF) were employed to combine the biomarker data with longitudinal clinical variables. The primary objective was to accurately predict RKFD (eGFR decline of [&ge;] 5 ml/min/1.73 m2/year) based on an algorithm-produced score and probability cutoffs, with results compared to standard of care.\\n\\nResultsIn 871 participants with T2DM, the mean age was 61 years, baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 74 ml/min/1.73 m2, and median UACR was 13 mg/g. The median follow-up was 4.7 years from the baseline specimen collection with additional retrospective data available for a median of 2.3 years prior to plasma collection. In the 498 African Ancestry patients with high-risk APOL1 genotype, the median age was 56 years, median baseline eGFR was 83 ml/min/1.73 m2,and median UACR was 11 mg/g. The median follow-up was 4.7 years and there was additional retrospective data available for 3.1 years prior to plasma collection. Overall, 19% with T2DM, and 9% of the APOL1 high-risk genotype experienced RKFD. After evaluation of three supervised algorithms: random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and Cox survival, the RF model was selected. In the training and test sets respectively, the RF model had an AUC of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.81-0.83) and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.78-0.82) in T2DM, and an AUC of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.84-0.87) and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.73-0.86) for the APOL1 high-risk group. The combined RF model outperformed standard clinical variables in both patient populations. Discrimination was comparable in two sensitivity analyses: 1) Using only data from [&le;] 1 year prior to baseline biomarker measurement and 2) In individuals with eGFR [&le;]60 and/or albuminuria at baseline. The distribution of RFKD probability varied in the two populations. In patients with T2DM, the RKFD score stratified 18%, 49%, and 33% of patients to high-, intermediate-, and low-probability strata, respectively, with a PPV of 53% in the high-probability group and an NPV of 97% in the low-probability group. By comparison, in the APOL1 high-risk genotype, the RKFD score stratified 7%, 23%, and 70% of patients to high-, intermediate-, and low-probability strata, respectively, with a 46% PPV in the high-probability and an NPV of 98% NPV in the low-probability group.\\n\\nConclusionsIn patients with T2DM or of African Ancestry with the high-risk APOL1 genotype, a RF model derived from plasma biomarkers and longitudinal EHR data significantly improved prediction of rapid kidney function decline over standard clinical models. With further validation, this approach may be valuable in aiding clinicians in identifying patients who would benefit most from early and more aggressive follow-up to mitigate kidney disease progression.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo explore factors underpinning discrepancies in reported pooled effect estimates from Cochrane and non-Cochrane systematic reviews answering the same question.\\n\\nStudy Design and SettingWe observed discrepant pooled effects in 23 out of 24 pairs of meta-analyses from Cochrane and non-Cochrane systematic reviews answering the same question. Here we present the results of a systematic assessment of methodological quality and factors that explain the observed quantitative discrepancies. Methodological quality of each review was assessed using AMSTAR (Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews). Matched pairs were contrasted at the macro- (review methodology), meso- (application of methodology) and micro- (data extraction) level and reasons for differences were derived.\\n\\nResultsAll Cochrane reviews had high methodological quality (AMSTAR 8-11), whereas the majority (87.5%) of non-Cochrane reviews were classified as moderate (AMSTAR 4-7). Only one pair included exactly the same studies for their respective meta-analyses but there was still a discrepancy in the pooled estimate due to differences in data extraction. One pair did not include any study of its match and for one pair the same effect estimates were reported despite inclusion of different studies. The remaining pairs included at least one study in their match. Due to insufficient reporting (predominantly affecting non-Cochrane reviews) we were only able to completely ascertain the reasons for discrepancies in all included studies for 9/24 (37.5%) pairs. Across all pairs, differences in pre-defined methods (macro-level) including search strategy, eligibility criteria and performance of dual screening could possibly explain mismatches in included studies. Study selection procedures (meso-level) including disagreements in the interpretation of pre-defined eligibility criteria (14 matches) were identified as reasons underpinning discrepant review findings. Comparison of data extraction from primary studies (micro-level) was not possible in 13/24 pairs as a result of the non-Cochrane review providing insufficient details of the studies included in their meta-analyses. Two out of 24 pairs completely agreed on the numerical data presented for the same studies in their respective meta-analysis. Both review types provided sufficient information to check the accuracy of data extraction for 8 pairs (45 studies) where there were discrepancies. An assessment of 50% (22 studies) of these showed that reasons for differences in extracted data could be identified in 15 studies. We found examples for both types of review where data presented were discrepant from that given in the source study without a plausible explanation.\\n\\nConclusionMethodological and author judgements and performance are key aspects underpinning poor overlap of included studies and discrepancies in reported pooled effect estimates between topic-matched reviews. Though caution must be taken when extrapolating, our findings raise the question as to what extent the entire meta-analysis evidence-base accurately reflects the available primary research both in terms of volume and data. Reinforcing awareness of the application of guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-analyses may help mitigate some of the key issues identified in our analysis.\\n\\nWhat is new?Key findings O_LINon-Cochrane reviews were of a lower overall methodological quality compared with Cochrane reviews. Discrepant results of meta-analyses on the same topic can be attributed to differences in included studies based on review author decision, judgements and performance at different stages of the review process.\\nC_LI\\n\\nWhat this adds to what was known?O_LIThis study provides the most robust analysis to date of the potential methodological factors underpinning discrepant review findings between matched meta-analyses answering the same question. Assessing differences between reviews at the macro-, meso-, and micro-levels is a useful method to identify reasons for discrepant meta-analyses at key stages of the review process.\\nC_LI\\n\\nWhat is the implication and what should change now?O_LIThere is a need for a standardised approach to performing matched-pair analysis of meta-analyses and systematic reviews answering the same question. Our paper provides a base for this that can be refined by replication and expert consensus.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Most current methods for detecting natural selection from DNA sequence data are limited in that they are either based on summary statistics or a composite likelihood, and as a consequence, do not make full use of the information available in DNA sequence data. We here present a new importance sampling approach for approximating the full likelihood function for the selection coefficient. The method treats the ancestral recombination graph (ARG) as a latent variable that is integrated out using previously published Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The method can be used for detecting selection, estimating selection coefficients, testing models of changes in the strength of selection, estimating the time of the start of a selective sweep, and for inferring the allele frequency trajectory of a selected or neutral allele. We perform extensive simulations to evaluate the method and show that it uniformly improves power to detect selection compared to current popular methods such as nSL and SDS, under various demographic models and can provide reliable inferences of allele frequency trajectories under many conditions. We also explore the potential of our method to detect extremely recent changes in the strength of selection. We use the method to infer the past allele frequency trajectory for a lactase persistence SNP (MCM6) in Europeans. We also study a set of 11 pigmentation-associated variants. Several genes show evidence of strong selection particularly within the last 5,000 years, including ASIP, KITLG, and TYR. However, selection on OCA2/HERC2 seems to be much older and, in contrast to previous claims, we find no evidence of selection on TYRP1.\\n\\nAuthor summaryCurrent methods to study natural selection using modern population genomic data are limited in their power and flexibility. Here, we present a new method to infer natural selection that builds on recent methodological advances in estimating genome-wide genealogies. By using importance sampling we are able to efficiently estimate the likelihood function of the selection coefficient. We show our method improves power to test for selection over competing methods across a diverse range of scenarios, and also accurately infers the selection coefficient. We also demonstrate a novel capability of our model, using it to infer the alleles frequency over time. We validate these results with a study of a lactase persistence SNP in Europeans, and also study a set of 11 pigmentation-associated variants.",

    "abstract": "Recently, an alcohol predictor was developed using DNA methylation at 144 CpG sites (DNAm-Alc) as a biomarker for improved clinical or epidemiologic assessment of alcohol-related ill health. We validate the performance and characterize the drivers of this DNAm-Alc for the first time in independent populations. In N=1,049 parents from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) Accessible Resource for Integrated Epigenomic Studies (ARIES) at midlife, we found DNAm-Alc explained 7.6% of the variation in alcohol intake, roughly half of what had been reported previously, and interestingly explained a larger 9.8% of AUDIT score, a scale of alcohol use disorder. Explanatory capacity in participants from the offspring generation of ARIES measured during adolescence was much lower. However, DNAm-Alc explained 14.3% of the variation in replication using the Head and Neck 5000 (HN5000) clinical cohort that had higher average alcohol consumption. To investigate whether this relationship was being driven by genetic and/or earlier environment confounding we examined how earlier vs. concurrent DNAm-Alc measures predicted AUDIT scores. In both ARIES parental and offspring generations, we observed associations between AUDIT and concurrent, but not earlier DNAm-Alc, suggesting independence from genetic and stable environmental contributions. The stronger relationship between DNAm-Alcs and AUDIT in parents at midlife compared to adolescents despite similar levels of consumption suggests that DNAm-Alc likely reflects long-term patterns of alcohol abuse. Such biomarkers may have potential applications for biomonitoring and risk prediction, especially in cases where reporting bias is a concern.",

There is a growing interest in the potential medical benefits of the various chemical constituents produced by the Cannabis plant. Currently, the University of Mississippi, funded through the National Institutes of Health/National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIH/NIDA), is the sole Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) licensed facility to cultivate Cannabis for research purposes. Hence, most federally funded research where participants consume Cannabis for medicinal purposes relies on NIDA-supplied product. Previous research found that cannabinoid levels in research grade marijuana supplied by NIDA did not align with commercially available Cannabis from Colorado, Washington and California. Given NIDA chemotypes were misaligned with commercial Cannabis, we sought to investigate where NIDAs research grade marijuana falls on the genetic spectrum of Cannabis groups. NIDA research grade marijuana was found to genetically group with Hemp samples along with a small subset of commercial drug-type Cannabis. A majority of commercially available drug-type Cannabis was genetically very distinct from NIDA samples.

    "abstract": "A major challenge in medical genetics is to characterize variants of unknown significance (VUS), so as to better understand underlying causes of disease and design customized treatments. Infertility has presented an especially difficult challenge with respect to not only determining if a given patient has a genetic basis, but also to identify the causative genetic factor(s). Though genome sequencing can identify candidate variants, in silico predictions of causation are not always sufficiently reliable so as to be actionable. Thus, experimental validation is crucial. Here, we describe the phenotype of mice containing a nonsynonymous (proline-to-threonine at position 306) change in Spo11, corresponding to human SNP rs185545661. SPO11 is a topoisomerase-like protein that is essential for meiosis because it induces DNA double stranded breaks (DSBs) that stimulate pairing and recombination of homologous chromosomes.\\n\\nAlthough both male and female Spo11P306T/P306T mice were fertile, they had reduced sperm and oocytes, respectively. Spermatocyte chromosomes exhibited synapsis defects (especially between the X and Y chromosomes), elevated apoptotic cells, persistent markers of DSBs, and most importantly, fewer Type 1 crossovers that causes some chromosomes to have none. Spo11P306T/- mice were sterile and made fewer meiotic DSBs than Spo11+/- animals, suggesting that the Spo11P306T allele is a hypomorph and likely is delayed in making sufficient DSBs in a timely fashion. If the consequences are recapitulated in humans, it would predict phenotypes of premature ovarian failure, reduced sperm counts, and possible increased number of aneuploid gametes. These results emphasize the importance of deep phenotyping in order to accurately assess the impact of VUSs in reproduction genes.",

We find that juveniles whose mothers experienced early life adversity exhibit high mortality before age 4, and this effect is independent of the juveniles own experience of early adversity. Furthermore, our results point towards a strong role for classic parental effects in driving these effects: mothers that experienced early life adversity displayed reduced viability in adulthood, which in turn led to reductions in offspring survival. Importantly, these mothers juvenile offspring often preceded them in death by 1 to 2 years, indicating that, for high adversity mothers, the quality of maternal care declines near the end of life. While we cannot exclude direct effects of a parents environment on offspring quality (e.g., transgenerational epigenetic changes), our results are most consistent with a classic parental effect, in which the environment experienced by a parent affects its future phenotype and therefore its offsprings phenotype. Together, our findings demonstrate that adversity experienced by individuals in one generation can have strong effects on the survival of offspring in the next generation, even if those offspring did not themselves experience early adversity.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of genomic regions affecting complex diseases. The next challenge is to elucidate the causal genes and mechanisms involved. One approach is to use statistical colocalization to assess shared genetic aetiology across multiple related traits (e.g. molecular traits, metabolic pathways and complex diseases) to identify causal pathways, prioritize causal variants and evaluate pleiotropy. We propose HyPrColoc (Hypothesis Prioritisation in multi-trait Colocalization), an efficient deterministic Bayesian algorithm using GWAS summary statistics that can detect colocalization across vast numbers of traits simultaneously (e.g. 100 traits can be jointly analysed in around 1 second). We performed a genome-wide multi-trait colocalization analysis of coronary heart disease (CHD) and fourteen related traits. HyPrColoc identified 43 regions in which CHD colocalized with [&ge;]1 trait, including 5 potentially new CHD loci. Across the 43 loci, we further integrated gene and protein expression quantitative trait loci to identify candidate causal genes.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic mechanisms regulate distinct aspects of the inflammatory response in various immune cell types. Despite the central role for microglia, the resident macrophages of the brain, in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration little is known about their epigenetic regulation of the inflammatory response. Here, we show that Ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2) methylcytosine dioxygenase expression is increased in microglia upon stimulation with various inflammogens through a NF-{kappa}B-dependent pathway. We found that TET2 regulates early gene transcriptional changes that lead to early metabolic alterations, as well as a later inflammatory response independently of its 5mC oxidation activity at the affected genes. We further show that TET2 regulates the proinflammatory response in microglia induced by intraperitoneal injection of LPS in vivo. We observed that microglia associated to amyloid {beta} plaques, recently defined as disease-associated microglia, expressed TET2 in brain tissue from individuals with Alzheimers disease (AD) and in 5xFAD mice. Collectively, our findings show that TET2 plays an important role in the microglial inflammatory response, and suggest TET2 as a potential target to combat neurodegenerative brain disorders.",

    "abstract": "DNA unwinding is an important cellular process involved in DNA replication, transcription and repair. In cells, molecular crowding caused by the presence of organelles, proteins, and other molecules affects numerous internal cellular structures. Here, we visualize plasmid DNA unwinding and binding dynamics to an oligonucleotide probe as functions of ionic strength, crowding agent concentration, and crowding agent species using single-molecule CLiC microscopy. We demonstrate increased probe-plasmid interaction over time with increasing concentration of 8 kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG), a crowding agent. We show decreased probe-plasmid interactions as ionic strength is increased without crowding. However, when crowding is introduced via 10% 8 kDa PEG, interactions between plasmids and oligos are enhanced. This is beyond what is expected for normal in vitro conditions, and may be a critically important, but as of yet unknown, factor in DNAs proper biological function in vivo. Our results show that crowding has a strong effect on the initial concentration of unwound plasmids. In the dilute conditions used in these experiments, crowding does not impact probe-plasmid interactions once the site is unwound.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing evidence showing that pleiotropy is a widespread phenomenon in complex diseases for which multiple correlated traits are often measured. Joint analysis of multiple traits could increase statistical power by aggregating multiple weak effects. Existing methods for multiple trait association tests usually study each of the multiple traits separately and then combine the univariate test statistics or combine p-values of the univariate tests for identifying disease associated genetic variants. However, ignoring correlation between phenotypes may cause power loss. Additionally, the genetic variants in one gene (including common and rare variants) are often viewed as a whole that affects the underlying disease since the basic functional unit of inheritance is a gene rather than a genetic variant. Thus, results from gene level association test can be more readily integrated with downstream functional and pathogenic investigation, whereas many existing methods for multiple trait association tests only focus on testing a single common variant rather than a gene. In this article, we propose a statistical method by Testing an Optimally Weighted Combination of Multiple traits (TOW-CM) to test the association between multiple traits and multiple variants in a genomic region (a gene or pathway). We investigate the performance of the proposed method through extensive simulation studies. Our simulation studies show that the proposed method has correct type I error rates and is either the most powerful test or comparable with the most powerful tests. In addition, we illustrate the usefulness of TOW-CM by analyzing a whole-genome genotyping data from a COPDGene study.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, is able to manipulate the phagosome compartment in which it resides in order to establish a permissive replicative compartment called the Mycobacterium-containing vacuole (MCV). Mycobacterium marinum, a fish pathogen and a close relative of the tuberculosis group, is able to infect the free-living amoeba and professional phagocyte Dictyostelium discoideum and to manipulate its phagosome maturation. By using this host-pathogen model system, we have established an innovative process to isolate MCVs. This procedure allowed us to isolate the M. marinum-MCV at 1, 3 and 6 hours post infection to study the early M. marinum-MCV proteome. By using isobaric labelling and mass spectrometry, we quantitatively compared the proteomic composition of those MCVs isolated at different stages of the early infection phase to understand how M. marinum impacts on this compartment to divert it from the normal phagosomal pathway. Furthermore, we also compared the manipulated compartment M. marinum-MCV to non- or less manipulated compartments containing different mycobacteria strains: the non-pathogenic M. smegmatis, the avirulent M. marinum-L1D or the attenuated M. marinum-RD1.",

    "abstract": "In many species of birds, parental care is provided by both parents to maximize offspring survival, and there may be important trade-offs between maximizing food gathering and nest protection during the nesting period. The role of parental care in determining reproductive success was investigated in Wood Storks (Mycteria americana), and specifically how the trade-off between frequency and duration of foraging trips, and nest protection has contributed to the nesting outcome. Parental behavior of 85 pairs of Wood Storks was monitored throughout the nesting season in two breeding colonies in Palm Beach County, Florida. Wood Storks have gradually increased the frequency, but not the duration, of foraging trips as chicks developed. The ratio of hatchlings to fledglings was positively associated with the frequency of foraging trips during late chick development. Intra-specific aggressions resulting in nest takeovers have affected 32 % of the nests under study. Occurrence of nest takeovers have been higher for later-breeding pairs, and was happened primarily in the first few weeks of incubation, but was not affected by the degree of joint nest attendance of both parents. These results establish a functional link between parental effort and reproductive outcome in Wood Storks, and highlight the importance of frequent foraging trips, but not nest attendance, by parents.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",
