    "abstract": "Gene duplication is a major source of genetic novelty and evolutionary adaptation, providing a molecular substrate that can generate biological complexity and diversity (Ohno 1967, Taylor and Raes 2004). Despite an abundance of genomic evidence from extant organisms suggesting the importance of gene duplication, consensus about how they arise and functionally diversify is lacking (Innan and Kondrashov 2010). In the process of studying the adaptation of laboratory strains of C. elegans to new food sources, we identified a recombinant inbred line (RIL) with higher relative fitness and hyperactive exploration behavior compared to either parental strain. Using bulk-segregant analysis and short-read resequencing, we identified a de novo beneficial, complex rearrangement of the rcan-1 gene, which we resolved into five new unique tandem inversion/duplications using Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing. rcan-1 encodes an ortholog to human RCAN1/DSCR1, which has been implicated as a causal gene for Down syndrome (Fuentes, Genesca et al. 2000). The genomic rearrangement in rcan-1 causes two complete and two truncated versions of the rcan-1 coding region, with a variety of modified promoter and 3 regions, which ultimately reduce whole-body gene expression. This rearrangement does not phenocopy a loss-of-function allele, which indicates that the rearrangement was necessary for the observed fitness gains. Our results demonstrate that adaptation can occur through unexpectedly complex genetic changes that can simultaneously duplicate and diversify a gene, providing the molecular substrate for future evolutionary change.",

    "abstract": "We carried out a systematic investigation of supervised learning techniques for biological age modeling. The biological aging acceleration is associated with the remaining health- and life-span. Artificial Deep Neural Networks (DNN) could be used to reduce the error of chronological age predictors, though often at the expense of the ability to distinguish health conditions. Mortality and morbidity hazards models based on survival follow-up data showed the best performance. Alternatively, logistic regression trained to identify chronic diseases was shown to be a good approximation of hazards models when data on survival follow-up times were unavailable. In all models, the biological aging acceleration was associated with disease burden in persons with diagnosed chronic age-related conditions. For healthy individuals, the same quantity was associated with molecular markers of inflammation (such as C-reactive protein), smoking, current physical, and mental health (including sleeping troubles, feeling tired or little interest in doing things). The biological age thus emerged as a universal biomarker of age, frailty and stress for applications involving large scale studies of the effects of longevity drugs on risks of diseases and quality of life.\\n\\nTo be published as Chapter 2 in \\\"Biomarkers of aging\\\", ed.

    "abstract": "Single-molecule fluorescence microscopy probes nanoscale, subcellular biology in real time. Existing methods for analyzing single-particle tracking data provide dynamical information, but can suffer from supervisory biases and high uncertainties. Here, we introduce a new approach to analyzing single-molecule trajectories: the Single-Molecule Analysis by Unsupervised Gibbs sampling (SMAUG) algorithm, which uses nonparametric Bayesian statistics to uncover the whole range of information contained within a single-particle trajectory (SPT) dataset. Even in complex systems where multiple biological states lead to a number of observed mobility states, SMAUG provides the number of mobility states, the average diffusion coefficient of single molecules in that state, the fraction of single molecules in that state, the localization noise, and the probability of transitioning between two different states. In this paper, we provide the theoretical background for the SMAUG analysis and then we validate the method using realistic simulations of SPT datasets as well as experiments on a controlled in vitro system. Finally, we demonstrate SMAUG on real experimental systems in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes to measure the motions of the regulatory protein TcpP in Vibrio cholerae and the dynamics of the B-cell receptor antigen response pathway in lymphocytes. Overall, SMAUG provides a mathematically rigorous approach to measuring the real-time dynamics of molecular interactions in living cells.\\n\\nStatement of SignificanceSuper-resolution microscopy allows researchers access to the motions of individual molecules inside living cells. However, due to experimental constraints and unknown interactions between molecules, rigorous conclusions cannot always be made from the resulting datasets when model fitting is used. SMAUG (Single-Molecule Analysis by Unsupervised Gibbs sampling) is an algorithm that uses Bayesian statistical methods to uncover the underlying behavior masked by noisy datasets. This paper outlines the theory behind the SMAUG approach, discusses its implementation, and then uses simulated data and simple experimental systems to show the efficacy of the SMAUG algorithm. Finally, this paper applies the SMAUG method to two model living cellular systems--one bacterial and one mammalian--and reports the dynamics of important membrane proteins to demonstrate the usefulness of SMAUG to a variety of systems.",

    "abstract": "The Drosophila Fog pathway represents one of the best-understood signaling cascades controlling epithelial morphogenesis. During gastrulation, Fog induces apical cell constrictions that drive the invagination of mesoderm and posterior gut primordia. The cellular mechanisms underlying primordia internalization vary greatly among insects and recent work has suggested that Fog signaling is specific to the fast mode of gastrulation found in some flies. On the contrary, here we show in the beetle Tribolium, whose development is broadly representative for insects, that Fog has multiple morphogenetic functions. It modulates mesoderm internalization and controls a massive posterior infolding involved in gut and extraembryonic development. In addition, Fog signaling affects blastoderm cellularization, primordial germ cell positioning and cuboidal-to-squamous cell shape transitions in the extraembryonic serosa. Comparative analyses with two other distantly related insect species reveals that Fogs role during cellularisation is widely conserved and therefore might represent the ancestral function of the pathway.",

Since primary neutrophils are terminally differentiated and not genetically tractable, leukemia cells such as HL-60 are differentiated into neutrophil-like cells to study mechanisms underlying neutrophil migration. However, constitutive overexpression or inhibition in this cell line does not allow the characterization of the genes that affect the differentiation process. Here we apply the tet-on system to induce the expression of zebrafish miR-722 in differentiated HL-60. Overexpression of miR-722 reduced the mRNA level of genes in the chemotaxis and inflammation pathways, including RAC2. Consistently, cell migration is significantly inhibited upon induced miR-722 overexpression. Together, miR-722 is an evolutionarily conserved suppressor for neutrophil migration and signaling in zebrafish and human.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic tolerance, the ability to temporarily sustain viability in the presence of bactericidal antibiotics, constitutes an understudied, yet likely widespread cause of antibiotic treatment failure. We have previously shown that the Gram-negative pathogen Vibrio cholerae is able to tolerate exposure to the typically bactericidal {beta}-lactam antibiotics by assuming a spherical morphotype devoid of detectable cell wall material. However, it is unclear how widespread tolerance is. Here, we have tested a panel of clinically significant Gram-negative pathogens for their response to the potent, broad-spectrum carbapenem antibiotic meropenem. We show that clinical isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella aerogenes, but not Escherichia coli, exhibit moderate to high levels of tolerance to meropenem, both in laboratory growth medium and in human serum. Importantly, tolerance was mediated by cell wall-deficient spheroplasts, which readily recovered to wild-type morphology and exponential growth upon removal of antibiotic. Our results suggest that carbapenem tolerance is prevalent in clinically significant bacterial species, and we suggest that this could contribute to treatment failure associated with these organisms.",

    "abstract": "Liver X receptors (LXR)  and {beta} serve important roles in cholesterol homeostasis, anti-inflammatory processes and the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). However, the development of therapies for liver fibrosis based on LXR agonists have been hampered due to side-effects such as liver steatosis. In this study, we demonstrated that HSCs expressed high levels of LXR{beta}, but not LXR, and that overexpression of LXR{beta} suppressed fibrosis and HSC activation in a carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced fibrosis mouse model, without resulting in liver steatosis. Furthermore, Hedgehog (Hh)-regulated proteins, markedly increased in the CCl4-affected liver and mainly expressed in activated HSCs, were repressed under conditions of LXR{beta} overexpression. In addition, LXR{beta} knockout led to activation of Hh signaling and triggering of HSC activation, while overexpression of LXR{beta} led to the inhibition of the Hh pathway and suppression of HSC activation. These results suggest that LXR{beta} suppresses the activation mechanism of HSCs by inhibiting Hh signaling. In conclusion, LXR{beta}, by restoring the differentiation of HSCs, may be a promising therapeutic target for liver fibrosis without the adverse side-effects of LXR activation.",

Non-additive interactions between mutations occur extensively and change across conditions, cell types, and species, making genetic prediction a difficult challenge. To understand the reasons for this, we reduced the problem to a minimal system where we combined mutations in a single protein performing a single function (a transcriptional repressor inhibiting a target gene). Even in this minimal system, a change in gene expression altered both the strength and type of genetic interactions. These seemingly complicated changes could, however, be predicted by a mathematical model that propagates the effects of mutations on protein folding to the cellular phenotype. We show that similar changes will be observed for many genes. These results provide fundamental insights into genotype-phenotype maps and illustrate how changes in genetic interactions can be predicted using hierarchical mechanistic models.\\n\\nOne sentence SummaryDeep mutagenesis of the lambda repressor reveals that changes in gene expression will alter the strength and direction of genetic interactions between mutations in many genes.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIDeep mutagenesis of the lambda repressor at two expression levels reveals extensive changes in mutational effects and genetic interactions\\nC_LIO_LIGenetic interactions can switch from positive (suppressive) to negative (enhancing) as the expression of a gene changes\\nC_LIO_LIA mathematical model that propagates the effects of mutations on protein folding to the cellular phenotype accurately predicts changes in mutational effects and interactions\\nC_LIO_LIChanges in expression will alter mutational effects and interactions for many genes\\nC_LIO_LIFor some genes, perfect mechanistic models will never be able to predict how mutations of known effect combine without measurements of intermediate phenotypes\\nC_LI",

We show that pre-DC are uniquely equipped among blood DC populations to promote HIV-1 replication and dissemination. Pre-DC stands out as the most susceptible DC population to infection by both HIV-1 CXCR4- and CCR5-tropic viral particles in a Siglec-1-dependent manner. HIV-1-infected pre-DC produce new viral progeny and transmit the virus to CD4+ T cells. Upon TLR activation, pre-DC become resistant to HIV-1 fusion and thus to infection and switch to a replication-independent mechanism of virus transfer to activated primary T lymphocytes mediated by Siglec-1. Thus, beside their role in DC ontogeny, blood pre-DC possess stage-specific properties that HIV-1 may exploit for viral spreading and modulation of the immune response.",

In large animals and humans, the current benchmark for high spatial and temporal resolution neural interfaces are fixed arrays of wire or silicon electrodes inserted into the parenchyma of the brain. However, probes that are large and stiff enough to penetrate the brain have been shown to cause acute and chronic damage and inflammation, which limits their longevity, stability, and yield. One approach to this problem is to separate the requirements of the insertion device, which should to be as stiff as possible, with the implanted device, which should be as small and flexible as possible. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of this approach with a system incorporating fine and flexible thin-film polymer probes, a fine and stiff insertion needle, and a robotic insertion machine. Together the system permits rapid and precise implantation of probes, each individually targeted to avoid observable vasculature and to attain diverse anatomical targets. As an initial demonstration of this system, we implanted arrays of electrodes in rat somatosensory cortex, recorded extracellular action potentials from them, and obtained histological images of the tissue response. This approach points the way toward a new generation of scaleable, stable, and safe neural interfaces, both for the basic scientific study of brain function and for clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Structural variants (SVs) rearrange large segments of the genome and can have profound consequences for evolution and human diseases. As national biobanks, disease association studies, and clinical genetic testing grow increasingly reliant on genome sequencing, population references such as the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) have become integral for interpreting genetic variation. To date, no large-scale reference maps of SVs exist from high-coverage sequencing comparable to those available for point mutations in protein-coding genes. Here, we constructed a reference atlas of SVs across 14,891 genomes from diverse global populations (54% non-European) as a component of gnomAD. We discovered a rich landscape of 433,371 distinct SVs, including 5,295 multi-breakpoint complex SVs across 11 mutational subclasses, and examples of localized chromosome shattering, as in chromothripsis. The average individual harbored 7,439 SVs, which accounted for 25-29% of all rare protein-truncating events per genome. We found strong correlations between constraint against damaging point mutations and rare SVs that both disrupt and duplicate protein-coding sequence, suggesting intolerance to reciprocal dosage alterations for a subset of tightly regulated genes. We also uncovered modest selection against noncoding SVs in cis-regulatory elements, although selection against protein-truncating SVs was stronger than any effect on noncoding SVs. Finally, we benchmarked carrier rates for medically relevant SVs, finding very large ([&ge;]1Mb) rare SVs in 3.8% of genomes (~1:26 individuals) and clinically reportable incidental SVs in 0.18% of genomes (~1:556 individuals). These data have been integrated directly into the gnomAD browser (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org) and will have broad utility for population genetics, disease association, and diagnostic screening.",

    "abstract": "We often perform actions where we must break through some resistive force, but want to remain in control during this unpredictable transition; for example, when an object we are pushing on transitions from static to dynamic friction and begins to move. We designed a laboratory task to replicate this situation in which participants actively pushed against a robotic manipulandum until they exceeded an unpredictable threshold, at which point the manipulandum moved freely. Human participants were instructed to either stop the movement of the handle following this unloading perturbation, or to continue pushing. We found that participants were able to modulate their reflexes in response to this unpredictable and self-triggered unloading perturbation according to the instruction they were following, and that this reflex modulation could not be explained by pre-perturbation muscle state. However, in a second task, where participants reactively produced force during the pre-unloading phase in response to the robotic manipulandum to maintain a set hand position, they were unable to modulate their reflexes in the same task-dependent way. This occurred even though the forces they produced were matched to the first task and they had more time to prepare for the unloading event. We suggest this disparity occurs because of different neural circuits involved in posture and movement, meaning that participants in the first task did not require additional time to switch from postural to movement control.",

    "abstract": "The computational study of biomolecules has been undermined by the lack of models that accurately represent the structure of big complexes at the atomic level. In this work, we report the development of an algorithm to generate a volumetric mesh of a biomolecule, of any size and shape, based on its atomic structure. Our mesh generation tool leverages the octree algorithm properties with parallel high-performance computing techniques to produce a discretized hexahedral model faster than previous methods. The reported algorithm is memory efficient and generates volumetric meshes suitable to be used directly in Finite Element Analysis. We tested the algorithm by producing mesh models of different biomolecule types and complex size, and also performed numerical simulations for the largest case. The Finite Element results show that our mesh models reproduce experimental data.",

The monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) rodent model of OA is now well established, however the effect of MIA on surrounding tissues post injection has not been investigated and as such the impact on phenotypic development is unknown. The aim of this investigation was to examine the impact of MIA incubation on skeletal muscle cells in vitro, to provide an indication as to the potential influence of MIA administration of skeletal muscle in vivo.\\n\\nMethodsC2C12 skeletal muscle myotubes were treated with either 4.8M MIA or 10M Dexamethasone (DEX, positive atrophic control) up to 72hrs post differentiation and sampled for morphological and mRNA analyses.\\n\\nResultsSignificant morphological effects (fusion index, number of myotubes and myotube width, p<0.05) were evident, demonstrating a hypertrophic phenotype in control (CON) compared to a hyperplasic phenotype in MIA and DEX. Increases in MAFbx mRNA were also evident between conditions, with post-hoc analysis demonstrating significance between CON and DEX (p<0.001), but not between CON and MIA (p>0.05).\\n\\nConclusionsThese data indicate a significant impact of both DEX and MIA on regeneration and hypertrophy in vitro and suggest differential activating mechanisms.

    "abstract": "HCF-2 is a member of the host-cell-factor protein family, which arose in early vertebrate evolution as a result of gene duplication. Whereas its paralog, HCF-1, is known to act as a versatile chromatin-associated protein required for cell proliferation and differentiation, much less is known about HCF-2. Here, we show that HCF-2 is broadly present in human and mouse cells, and possesses activities distinct from HCF-1. Unlike HCF-1, which is excluded from nucleoli, HCF-2 is nucleolar -- an activity conferred by one and a half C-terminal Fibronectin type 3 repeats and inhibited by the HCF-1 nuclear localization signal. Elevated HCF-2 synthesis in HEK-293 cells results in phenotypes reminiscent of HCF-1-depleted cells, including inhibition of cell proliferation and mitotic defects. Furthermore, increased HCF-2 levels in HEK-293 cells lead to inhibition of cell proliferation and metabolism gene-expression programs with parallel activation of differentiation and morphogenesis gene-expression programs. Thus, the HCF ancestor appears to have evolved into a small two-member protein family possessing contrasting nuclear vs. nucleolar localization, and cell proliferation and differentiation functions.",

    "abstract": "Zebrafish dorsal forerunner cells (DFCs) undergo vigorous proliferation during epiboly and then exit cell cycle to generate Kupffers vesicle (KV), a ciliated organ necessary for establishing left-right (L-R) asymmetry. DFC proliferation defects are often accompanied by impaired cilia elongation in KV, but the functional and molecular interaction between cell-cycle progression and cilia formation remains unknown. Here we show that chemokine receptor Cxcr4a is required for L-R laterality by controlling DFC proliferation and KV ciliogenesis. Functional analysis revealed that Cxcr4a accelerates G1/S transition in DFCs and stabilizes Foxj1a, a master regulator of motile cilia, by stimulating Cyclin D1 expression through ERK1/2 signaling. Mechanistically, Cyclin D1-CDK4/6 drives G1/S transition during DFC proliferation and phosphorylates Foxj1a, thereby disrupting its association with Psmd4b, a 19S regulatory subunit. This prevents the ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation of Foxj1a. Our study uncovers a role for Cxcr4 signaling in L-R patterning and provides fundamental insights into the molecular linkage between cell-cycle progression and ciliogenesis.\\n\\nAuthor summaryDuring the organogenesis of zebrafish L-R organizer named KV, DFCs proliferate rapidly during epiboly and then exit the cell cycle to differentiate into ciliated epithelial KV cells. Cell cycle defects in DFCs are often accompanied by an alteration in KV cilia elongation. However, whether the cell cycle and cilia formation are mechanistically linked remains as an open question. In this study, we report that Cxcr4 signaling is required for DFC proliferation and KV ciliogenesis. We reveal that Cxcl12b/Cxcr4a signaling activates ERK1/2, which then promotes Cyclin D1 expression. Cyclin D1-CDK4/6 accelerates the G1/S transition in DFCs, while also facilitates cilia formation via stabilization of Foxj1a. Notably, Foxj1 undergoes proteasomal degradation via Ub-independent pathway during KV organogenesis. Our study further demonstrates that CDK4 phosphorylates and stabilizes Foxj1a by disrupting its association with Psmd4b, a 19S regulatory subunit. In summary, Cxcl12b/Cxcr4a chemokine signaling links cell cycle progression and cilia formation for L-R symmetry breaking via regulating Cyclin D1 expression.",

    "abstract": "Neural progenitors undergo temporal patterning to generate diverse neurons in a chronological order. This process is well-studied in the developing Drosophila brain and conserved in mammals. During larval stages, intermediate neural progenitors (INPs) serially express Dichaete (D), grainyhead (Grh) and eyeless (Ey/Pax6), but how the transitions are regulated is not precisely understood. Here, we developed a method to isolate transcriptomes of INPs in their distinct temporal states to identify a complete set of temporal patterning factors. Our analysis identifies odd-paired (opa), as a key regulator of temporal patterning. Temporal patterning is initiated when the SWI/SNF complex component Osa induces D and its repressor Opa at the same time but with distinct kinetics. Then, high Opa levels repress D to allow Grh transcription and progress to the next temporal state. We propose that Osa and its target genes opa and D form an incoherent feedforward loop (FFL) and a new mechanism allowing the successive expression of temporal identities.",

    "abstract": "The human pathogenic yeast Cryptococcus neoformans silences transposable elements using endo-siRNAs and an Argonaute, Ago1. Endo-siRNAs production requires the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, Rdp1, and two partially redundant Dicer enzymes, Dcr1 and Dcr2, but is independent of histone H3 lysine 9 methylation. We describe here an insertional mutagenesis screen for factors required to suppress the mobilization of the C. neoformans HARBINGER family DNA transposon HAR1. Validation experiments uncovered five novel genes (RDE1-5) required for HAR1 suppression and global production of suppressive endo-siRNAs. Loss of the RDE genes does not impact transcript levels, suggesting the endo-siRNAs do not act by impacting target transcript synthesis or turnover. RDE3 encodes a non-Dicer RNase III related to S. cerevisiae Rnt1, RDE4 encodes a predicted terminal nucleotidyltransferase, while RDE5 has no strongly predicted encoded domains. Affinity purification-mass spectrometry studies reveal that Rde3 and Rde5 are physically associated. RDE1 encodes a G-patch protein homologous to the S. cerevisiae Sqs1/Pfa1, a nucleolar protein that directly activates the essential helicase Prp43 during rRNA biogenesis. Rde1 copurifies Rde2, another novel protein obtained in the screen, as well as Ago1, a homolog of Prp43, and numerous predicted nucleolar proteins. We also describe the isolation of conditional alleles of PRP43, which are defective in RNAi. This work reveals unanticipated requirements for a non-Dicer RNase III and presumptive nucleolar factors for endo-siRNA biogenesis and transposon mobilization suppression in C. neoformans.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe underlying pathophysiology of swallowing and chewing difficulties is multifactorial and evidence clarifying the precise mechanisms are scarce. Dysfunction in dopamine-related and non-dopamine-related pathways, changes in cortical networks related with swallowing and peripheral mechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of swallowing difficulties. We aimed at investigating whether swallowing and chewing difficulties are associated with presynaptic dopaminergic deficits, faster motor symptom progression and cognitive decline in a population of early drug-naive patients with Parkinsons disease.\\n\\nMethodsBy exploring the database of Parkinsons Progression Markers Initiative we identified forty-nine early drug-naive Parkinsons disease patients with swallowing difficulties. Swallowing and chewing impairment was identified with SCOPA-AUT question 1 (answer regularly) and was assessed with MDS-UPDRS Part-II, Item 2.3 (Chewing and Swallowing). We compared Parkinsons disease patients with swallowing and chewing difficulties to Parkinsons disease patients without difficulties, and investigated differences in striatal [123I]FP-CIT single photon emission computed tomography levels. Using Cox proportional hazards analyses, we also evaluated whether swallowing impairment can predict motor deterioration and cognitive dysfunction.\\n\\nResultsPatients with Parkinsons disease, harbored a greater deterioration regarding motor and non-motor symptoms and decreased [123I]FP-CIT binding when compared with patients without swallowing and chewing impairment. Higher burden of swallowing and chewing dysfunction (MDS-UPDRS-II, item 2.3) was correlated with lower [123I]FP-CIT uptakes within the striatum (rs=-0.157; P=0.002) and the caudate (rs=-0.156; P=0.002). The presence of swallowing and chewing difficulties was not a predictor of motor progression (Hazard ratio [HR]: 1.143, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.848-1.541; P=0.379) or cognitive decline (HR: 1.294, 95% CI: 0.616-2.719; P=0.496).\\n\\nConclusionsSwallowing and chewing impairment is associated with decreased presynaptic dopaminergic integrity within caudate and greater motor and non-motor symptoms burden in early drug-naive PD.\\n\\nAuthor contributionsS.P. and M.P. conceived the study, conceptualized the experimental design.

Patients were required to have continuous medical and pharmacy benefits for [&ge;]6 months baseline and [&ge;]12 months follow-up period. Patient demographics, baseline clinical characteristics, the rate of uncomplicated and complicated VOC (VOC with concomitant SCD complications) episodes, and reasons for ER visits and inpatient stays were analyzed descriptively. A total of 8,521 patients were included in the analysis, with a median age of 30 years. The average follow-up period was 2.7 years. The rate of VOC episodes anytime in the follow-up was 3.31 in person-years. During the first-year follow-up period, an average of 2.79 VOC episodes were identified per SCD patients, with 1.06 VOC episodes treated in inpatient setting and 0.90 VOC episodes in ER without admission. A total of 76,154 VOC episodes were identified during the entire follow-up period for the overall SCD patients. Most of the VOC episodes (70.3% [n=53,523]) were uncomplicated episodes, and 29.7% were complicated episodes. Using primary diagnosis claims only, the most frequent complications during the VOC episode were infectious diseases (25.9%), fever (21.8%), and pulmonary disorders (16.2%). Among ER and hospitalizations related to VOC or SCD complication, ~85.0% had VOCs as the primary reason for admission; 15.0% had SCD complications as the primary reason. In summary, SCD and its related comorbidities and complications result in high acute health care utilization. In addition, VOC remains the primary reason for SCD patients ER visits and inpatient admissions.",

Erythrina abyssinica Lam ex DC is an indigenous tree used widely used in traditional medicine, including for the treatment of liver related diseases, and has been shown to possess hypoglycemic, anti-oxidant, antimicrobial and anti-plasmodia effects. The present study is aimed at establishing the effects of E. abyssinica on the development of Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease induced by a high-fat and high-sugar diet in rats, in-vivo model.\\n\\nMethodsForty rats (40) were randomly divided into five groups: positive control (pioglitazone), Negative control (high fat/high sugar diet), low test dose (200 mg/kg), high test dose (400 mg/kg) and normal group (standard chow pellets and fresh water).\\n\\nThe inhibitory effect of the stem bark extract of E. abyssinica on the development of NAFLD was evaluated by chronic administration the herb extracts to rats on a high-fat/high-sugar diet. Biochemical indices of hepatic function including serum lipid profile, serum aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase levels were then determined. Histological analysis of liver samples was carried out to quantify the degree of steato-hepatitis. Liver weights were taken and used to determine the hepatic index. The data was analyzed using one-way ANOVA, and Tukeys post-hoc tests were done in cases of significance.

    "abstract": "Taxonomy for bacterial isolates is commonly assigned via sequence analysis. However, the most common sequence-based approaches (e.g. 16S rRNA gene-based phylogeny or whole genome comparisons) are still labor intensive and subjective to varying degrees. Here we present a set of 33 bacterial genomes, isolated from the canine oral cavity. Taxonomy of these isolates was first assigned by PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene, Sanger sequencing, and taxonomy assignment using BLAST. After genome sequencing, taxonomy was revisited through a manual process using a combination of average nucleotide identity (ANI), concatenated marker gene phylogenies, and 16S rRNA gene phylogenies. This taxonomy was then compared to the automated taxonomic assignment given by the recently proposed Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB). We found the results of all three methods to be similar (25 out of the 33 had matching genera), but the GTDB approach was less subjective, and required far less labor. The primary differences in the remaining taxonomic assignments related to proposed taxonomy changes by the GTDB team.",

    "abstract": "From observations of colloidal tracer particles in fibrin undergoing gelation, we introduce an analytical framework that allows determination of the probability density function (PDF) for a stochastic process beyond fractional Brownian motion. Using passive microrheology via videomicroscopy, mean square displacements (MSD) of tracer particles suspended in fibrin at different ageing times are obtained. The anomalous diffusion is then described by a damped white noise process with memory, with analytical results closely matching experimental plots of MSD and PDF. We further show that the white noise functional stochastic approach applied to passive microrheology reveals the existence of a gelation parameter  which elucidates the dynamics of constrained tracer particles embedded in a time dependent soft material. This study offers experimental insights on the ageing of fibrin gels while presenting a white noise functional stochastic approach that could be applied to other systems exhibiting non-Markovian diffusive behavior.",

    "abstract": "Milk yield is the most important dairy sheep trait and constitutes the key genetic improvement goal via selective breeding. Mastitis is one of the most prevalent diseases, significantly impacting on animal welfare, milk yield and quality, while incurring substantial costs. Our objectives were to determine the feasibility of a concomitant genetic improvement programme for enhanced milk production and resistance to mastitis. Individual records for milk yield and four mastitis-related traits were collected monthly throughout lactation for 609 ewes of the Chios breed. All ewes were genotyped with a mastitis specific custom-made 960 single nucleotide polymorphism array. We performed genomic association studies, (co)variance component estimation and pathway enrichment analysis, and characterised gene expression levels and the extent of allelic expression imbalance. Presence of heritable variation for milk yield was confirmed. There was no significant genetic correlation between milk yield and mastitis. Environmental factors appeared to favour both milk production and udder health. Four Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) affecting milk yield were detected on chromosomes 2, 12, 16 and 19, in locations distinct from those previously identified to affect mastitis resistance. Pathways, networks and functional gene clusters for milk yield were identified. Seven genes (DNAJA1, DNAJC10, FGF10, GHR, HMGCS1, LYPLA1, OXCT1) located within the QTL regions were highly expressed in both the mammary gland and milk transcriptome, suggesting involvement in milk synthesis and production. Furthermore, the expression of four genes (DNAJC10, FGF10, OXCT1, EMB) was enriched in immune tissues implying a favourable pleiotropic effect or likely role in milk production during udder infection. In conclusion, the absence of genetic antagonism between milk yield and mastitis resistance suggests that simultaneous genetic improvement of both traits be achievable. The detection of milk yield QTLs with the mastitis array underpins the latters utility as a breeding tool for the genetic enhancement of both traits.",

    "abstract": "In Myxococcus xanthus, directed movement is controlled by inter-dependent pole-to-pole oscillations of the small GTPase MglA, its GAP MglB and the RomR protein. However, these proteins have strikingly different oscillatory regimes such that MglA is segregated from MglB and RomR at reversal activation. The molecular mechanism whereby information is exchanged between the lagging and leading poles resulting in MglA detachment from the leading pole during reversals has remained unknown. Here, we show that MglA has two GTP-bound forms, one of which is insensitive to MglB (MglA-GTP*) and is re-sensitized to MglB by a feedback mechanism operated by MglA-GDP. By identifying the region of MglB that is critical for its association to the lagging pole, we demonstrate that MglA-GTP* is functional in vivo. These data suggest that MglA-GDP acts as a soluble messenger to convert polar MglA-GTP* into a diffusible MglA-GTP species, explaining MglA re-localization to the opposite pole during reversals.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging studies typically use standard anatomical atlases for identification and analyses of (patho-)physiological effects on specific brain areas; these atlases often fail to incorporate neuroanatomical alterations that may occur with both age and disease. The present study utilizes Parkinsons disease and age-specific anatomical atlases of the subthalamic nucleus for diffusion tractography, assessing tracts that run between the subthalamic nucleus and a-priori defined cortical areas known to be affected by Parkinsons disease. The results show that the strength of white matter fiber tracts appear to remain structurally unaffected by disease. Contrary to that, Fractional Anisotropy values were shown to decrease in Parkinsons disease patients for connections between the subthalamic nucleus and the pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the pre-supplementary motor, collectively involved in preparatory motor control, decision making and task monitoring. While the biological underpinnings of fractional anisotropy alterations remain elusive, they may nonetheless be used as an index of Parkinsons disease. Moreover, we find that failing to account for structural changes occurring in the subthalamic nucleus with age and disease reduce the accuracy and influence the results of tractography, highlighting the importance of using appropriate atlases for tractography.",
