    "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the renopreventive effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), enalapril, and/or vitamin D receptor (VDR) activator, paricalcitol, on streptozotocin (STZ) diabetes-induced nephropathy and to elucidate the mechanisms of action through investigation of the effects on renal oxidative stress, antioxidant defense system and expressions of TNF-, P53, caspase-3, and Bcl-2. Diabetes mellitus was induced in fasting male Wistar rats by single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (45 mg /kg b.w.) dissolved in citrate buffer pH 4.5. Ten days after STZ injection, the diabetic rats were treated with enalapril (25 mg/l of drinking water) and/or paricalcitol (8 {micro}g/kg b.w. per os) dissolved in 5% DMSO daily for 4 weeks. The obtained data revealed that the treatment of diabetic Wistar rats with enalapril and/or paricalcitol led to a significant decrease in the elevated serum urea, uric acid, creatinine and sodium, potassium levels; thereby reflecting improvement of the impaired kidney function. The deteriorated kidney lipid peroxidation, GSH content and GST and catalase activities in diabetic rats were significantly ameliorated as a result of treatment with enalapril and/or paricalcitol. The elevated fasting and post-prandial serum glucose levels and the lowered serum insulin and C-peptide levels were also improved. Moreover, the treatment of diabetic rats successfully prevented the diabetes-induced histopathological deleterious changes of kidney and islets of Langerhans of pancreas. In association, the immunohistochemically detected pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF- and apoptotic mediators P53 and caspase-3 were remarkably decreased in kidney of diabetic rats as a result of treatment, while the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was increased. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that enalapril and paricalcitol can prevent STZ diabetes-induced nephropathy though amelioration of the glycemic state and antioxidant defense system together with the suppression of oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis.",

    "abstract": "Dietary insufficiencies have been well documented to decrease growth rates and survival (and therefore overall production) in fish aquaculture. By contrast, the effects of dietary insufficiencies on the sensory biology of cultured fish remains largely unstudied. Diets based solely on plant protein sources could have advantages over fish-based diets, because of the cost and ecological effects of the latter, but lack the amino acid taurine. Adequate levels of taurine are, however, necessary for the development of a fully functional visual system in mammals. As part of ongoing studies to determine the suitability of plant-based diets, we investigated the effects of normal and reduced taurine dietary levels on retinal anatomy and function in European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). We could not demonstrate any effects of dietary taurine level on retinal anatomy, nor the functional properties of luminous sensitivity or temporal resolution (measured as flicker fusion frequency). We did, however, find an effect on spectral sensitivity. The peak of spectral sensitivity of individuals fed a 5% taurine diet was rightward shifted (i.e., towards longer wavelengths) relative to that of fish fed a 0% or 1.5 % taurine diet. This difference in in spectral sensitivity was due to a relatively lower level of middle wavelength pigment (maximum absorbance {approx}500 nm) in fish fed a 5% taurine diet. Changes in spectral sensitivity resulting from diets containing different taurine levels are unlikely to be detrimental to fish destined for market but could be in fishes that are being reared for stock enhancement programs.",

Furthermore, total N affected clover amino acid profiles from non-essential amino acids at low N doses to the dominance of essential amino acids at increasing N doses. Asn uptake rate in white clover is reduced by increasing inorganic N, but not by increasing organic N concentrations. Furthermore, plant amino acid profiles are likely to be a more sensitive indicator of N supply and descriptor of the N status.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTo be transmitted to vertebrate hosts via the saliva of their vectors, arthropod-borne viruses have to cross several barriers in the mosquito body, including the midgut infection and escape barriers. Yellow fever virus (YFV) belongs to the genus Flavivirus, which includes human viruses transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, such as Dengue and Zika viruses. The live-attenuated YFV-17D vaccine has been used safely and efficiently on a large scale since the end of World War II. Early studies have shown, using viral titration from salivary glands of infected mosquitoes, that YFV-17D can infect Aedes aegypti midgut, but does not disseminate to other tissues.\\n\\nMethodology/Principal FindingsHere, we re-visited this issue using a panel of techniques, such as RT-qPCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence and titration assays. We showed that YFV-17D replication was not efficient in Aedes aegypti midgut, as compared to the clinical isolate YFV-Dakar. Viruses that replicated in the midgut failed to disseminate to secondary organs. When injected into the thorax of mosquitoes, viruses succeeded in replicating into midgut-associated tissues, suggesting that, during natural infection, the block for YFV-17D replication occurs at the basal membrane of the midgut. Our NGS analysis revealed that YFV-Dakar genome exhibited a greater diversity than the vaccine strain; a trait that may contribute to its ability to infect and disseminate efficiently in Ae. aegypti.\\n\\nConclusions/SignificanceThe two barriers associated with Ae. aegypti midgut prevent YFV-17D replication. Our study contributes to our basic understanding of vector-pathogen interactions and may also aid in the development of non-transmissible live virus vaccines.\\n\\nAuthor summaryMost flaviviruses, including yellow fever virus (YFV), are transmitted between hosts by mosquito bites. The yellow fever vaccine (YFV-17D) is one of the safest and most effective live virus vaccine ever developed. It is also used as a platform for engineering vaccines against other health-threatening flaviviruses, such as Japanese encephalitis, West Nile, Dengue and Zika viruses. We studied here the replication and dissemination of YFV-17D in mosquitoes. Our data showed that YFV-17D replicates poorly in mosquito midgut and is unable to disseminate to secondary organs, as compare to a YFV clinical isolate. Our study contributes to our basic understanding of the interactions between viruses and their vectors, which is key for conceiving new approaches in inhibiting virus transmission and designing non-transmissible live virus vaccines.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVEErythropoietin (EPO) is a clinically available hematopoietic cytokine. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of EPO on a rat model of cervical cord compression myelopathy and to explore the possibility of its use as a pharmacological treatment.\\n\\nMETHODSTo produce the chronic cervical cord compression model, thin polyurethane sheets were implanted under the C5-C6 laminae of rats and gradually expanded due to water absorption. In this model, motor functions significantly declined from 7 weeks after surgery. Based on the result, EPO administration was started 8 weeks after surgery. Motor function as seen with rotarod performance and grip strength was measured 16 weeks after surgery, and then motor neurons were stained with H-E and NeuN staining, and counted. Apoptotic cell death was assessed with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. To assess transfer of EPO into spinal cord tissue, the EPO level in spinal cord tissue was measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for each group after subcutaneous injection of EPO.\\n\\nRESULTSHigh-dose EPO (5000 IU/kg) administered from 8 weeks after surgery markedly restored and maintained motor function in the Compression groups (P < 0.01). EPO significantly prevented loss of motor neurons in the anterior horn (P < 0.05) and significantly decreased the number of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells (P < 0.05). The EPO level in spinal cord tissue was significantly higher in the High-dose EPO group than other groups.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSEPO improves motor function in rats with progressive chronic compression myelopathy. EPO protects anterior horn motor neurons and inhibits neuronal cell apoptosis in spinal cord compression. The neuroprotective effects can be produced through transfer of EPO into spinal cord tissue. These findings suggest that EPO has high potential as a treatment for developing compression myelopathy.",

However, in young adults, there are only a few reports that show a correlation between nutrient/food intake and periodontal disease. Moreover, no report has assessed the correlation between dietary habits measured by a self-administered diet history questionnaire (DHQ) and periodontal disease. Therefore, we assessed the correlation between dietary habits, determined using a DHQ, and periodontal disease in young adult women who are likely to develop a periodontal disease.\\n\\nMethodsThe participants were 120 healthy, non-smoking, female college students (mean age, 20.4 {+/-} 1.1 years) from two universities who did not have any systemic disease. The participants were assessed for periodontal disease according to community periodontal index (CPI) and were divided into two groups. Subjects with a CPI code of 0, 1, or 2 were assigned to non-periodontal disease group (non-PD), and subjects with a CPI code of 3 or 4 were assigned to periodontal disease group (PD). Dietary habits were assessed using a DHQ. In addition, physical status, level of difficulty in chewing food (dietary hardness), masticatory performance, and quality of life (QoL) were assessed.\\n\\nResultsThe PD group had a significantly lower nutrient intake of minerals, fat, water-soluble vitamins, and dietary fiber than the non-PD group. In terms of food groups, the PD group consumed significantly lesser amounts of green and yellow vegetables than the non-PD group. In addition, the PD group consumed significantly lesser amounts of hard foods than the non-PD group.\\n\\nConclusionYoung adult women with a periodontal disease had a significantly lower nutrient/food intake than young adult women without a periodontal disease.",

    "abstract": "From the microscopic to the macroscopic level, biological life exhibits directed migration in response to environmental conditions. Chemotaxis enables microbes to sense and move towards nutrient-rich regions or to avoid toxic ones. Socio-economic factors drive human populations from rural to urban areas. However, migration affects the quantity and quality of desirable resources. The effect of collective movement is especially significant when in response to the generation of public goods. Microbial communities can, for instance, alter their environment through the secretion of extracellular substances. Some substances provide antibiotic-resistance, others provide access to nutrients or promote motility. However, in all cases the maintenance of such public goods requires costly cooperation and is consequently susceptible to exploitation. The threat of exploitation becomes even more acute with motile individuals as defectors can avoid the consequences of their cheating.\\n\\nHere, we propose a model to investigate the effects of targeted migration based on the production of ecological public goods and analyze the interplay between social conflicts and migration. In particular, individuals can locate attractive regions by moving towards higher cooperator densities or avoid unattractive regions by moving away from defectors. Both migration patterns not only shape an individuals immediate environment but also affects the population as a whole. For example, defectors hunting cooperators in search of the public good have a homogenizing effect on population densities. They limit the production of the public good and hence inhibit the growth of the population. In contrast, aggregating cooperators promote the spontaneous formation of heterogeneous density distributions. The positive feedback between cooperator aggregation and public goods production, however, poses analytical and numerical challenges due to its tendency to develop discontinuous distributions. Thus, different modes of directed migration bear the potential to enhance or inhibit the emergence of complex and sometimes dynamic spatial arrangements. Interestingly, whenever patterns emerge in the form of heterogeneous density distributions, cooperation is promoted, on average, population densities rise, and the risk of extinction is reduced.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe production and maintenance of shared environmental resources such as access to nutrients in microbial communities or potable water in human societies require the cooperation of groups of individuals. However, cooperation is costly and prone to exploitation. If too many individuals follow selfish interests and spoil their environment, the group and possibly the entire population suffers. Nevertheless, many forms of biological life - from humans to microbes - migrate in response to resource availability. Here, we analyze the interplay of the social conflict in public goods production and targeted migration. In particular, we find that aggregation of cooperators can enhance or trigger the spontaneous formation of heterogeneous spatial distributions, which promote cooperation and result in higher population densities. Conversely, attempts to avoid defectors increases the risk of extinction because it tends to homogenize population distributions and lower population densities.",

    "abstract": "Necrotrophic plant pathogens acquire nutrients from dead plant cells, which requires the disintegration of the plant cell wall and tissue structures by the pathogen. Infected plants lose tissue integrity and functional immunity as a result, exposing the nutrient rich, decayed tissues to the environment. One challenge for the necrotrophs to successfully cause secondary infection (infection spread from an initially infected plant to the nearby uninfected plants) is to effectively utilize nutrients released from hosts towards building up a large population before other saprophytes come. In this study, we observed that the necrotrophic pathogen Dickeya dadantii exhibited heterogeneity in bacterial cell length in an isogenic population during infection of potato tuber. While some cells were regular rod-shape (<10m), the rest elongated into filamentous cells (>10m). Short cells tended to occur at the interface of healthy and diseased tissues, during the early stage of infection when active attacking and killing is occurring, while filamentous cells tended to form when large amount of nutrients were released at a later stage of infection. Short cells expressed all necessary virulence factors and motility, whereas filamentous cells did not engage in virulence, were non-mobile and more sensitive to environmental stress. However, compared to the short cells, the filamentous cells displayed elevated metabolism and faster growth, which may benefit the pathogens to build up a large population necessary for the secondary infection. The segregation of the two subpopulations was dependent on differential expression of the alarmone guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp). When exposed to fresh tuber tissues or freestanding water, filamentous cells quickly transformed to short virulent cells. The pathogen adaptation of cell length heterogeneity identified in this study presents a model for how some necrotrophs balance virulence and vegetative growth to maximize fitness during infection.",

    "abstract": "Herein we report the identification and characterisation of two linear antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), HG2 and HG4, with activity against a wide range of multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria, especially methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains, a highly problematic group of Gram-positive bacteria in the hospital and community environment. To identify the novel AMPs presented here, we employed the classifier model design, a feature extraction method using molecular descriptors for amino acids for the analysis, visualization, and interpretation of AMP activities from a rumen metagenomic dataset. This allowed for the in silico discrimination of active and inactive peptides in order to define a small number of promising novel lead AMP test candidates for chemical synthesis and experimental evaluation. In vitro data suggest that the chosen AMPs are fast acting, show strong biofilm inhibition and dispersal activity and are efficacious in an in vivo model of MRSA USA300 infection, whilst showing little toxicity to human erythrocytes and human primary cell lines ex vivo. Observations from biophysical AMP-lipid-interactions and electron microscopy suggest that the newly identified peptides interact with the cell membrane and may be involved in the inhibition of other cellular processes. Amphiphilic conformations associated with membrane disruption are also observed in 3D molecular modelling of the peptides. HG2 and HG4 both preferentially bind to MRSA total lipids rather than with human cell lipids indicating that HG4 may form superior templates for safer therapeutic candidates for MDR bacterial infections.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryWe are losing our ability to treat multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria, otherwise known as superbugs. This poses a serious global threat to human health as bacteria are increasingly acquiring resistance to antibiotics. There is therefore urgent need to intensify our efforts to develop new safer alternative drug candidates. We emphasise the usefulness of complementing wet-lab and in silico techniques for the rapid identification of new drug candidates from environmental samples, especially antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). HG2 and HG4, the AMPs identified in our study show promise as effective therapies for the treatment of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections both in vitro and in vivo whilst having little cytotoxicity against human primary cells, a step forward in the fight against MDR infections.",

    "abstract": "Background: High epilepsy prevalence and incidence were observed in onchocerciasis-endemic villages in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). We sought to investigate the clinical characteristics of onchocerciasis-associated epilepsy (OAE), and the relationship with microfilarial density. Methods: In October 2017, ivermectin-naive persons with epilepsy (PWE) were recruited from onchocerciasis-endemic areas in the Logo health zone in the DRC. Additional PWE were enrolled in the Aketi health zone, where ivermectin had been distributed annually for 14 years. Past medical history, clinical characteristics and skin snips for Onchocerca volvulus detection were obtained from participants. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were used to investigate associations with microfilarial density. Results: Of the 420 PWE in the Logo health zone, 392 were skin snipped (36.5% positive). Generalized motor seizures were most frequent (392 PWE, 93.3%), and nodding seizures were reported in 32 (7.6%) participants. Twelve PWE (3.1%) presented Nakalanga features. More skin snip-positive participants reported a family history of epilepsy (p=0.027). Eighty-one onchocerciasis-infected PWE were recruited in the Aketi health zone. Positive correlations between seizure frequency and microfilarial density were observed in Logo (Spearman-rho=0.181; p=0.0003) and Aketi (Spearman-rho=0.228; p=0.046). In the multivariable analysis which adjusted for age, gender and previous anti-epileptic drug use, factors associated with high seizure frequency included: high microfilarial density (RR=1.004, 95% CI: 1.002-1.007; p<0.001), history of nodding seizures (RR=3.852, 95% CI: 2.926-5.082; p<0.001) and shorter duration of epilepsy (RR=0.948, 95% CI: 0.928-0.968; p<0.001). In Aketi, previous ivermectin use was associated with reduced seizures (RR=0.69, 95% CI: 0.58-0.83; p<0.001). Conclusion: In onchocerciasis-endemic regions in the DRC, a wide spectrum of seizures was observed. Nodding seizures, Nakalanga features, and a positive association between microfilarial density and seizures suggest a high OAE prevalence in the study villages, requiring a double management strategy: treatment with anti-epileptic drugs and stronger onchocerciasis elimination programs.",

    "abstract": "Combination therapies for various cancers have been shown to increase efficacy, lower toxicity, and circumvent resistance. However, despite the promise of combinatorial therapies, the biological mechanisms behind drug synergy have not been fully characterized, and the systematic testing of all possible synergistic therapies is experimentally infeasible due to the sheer volume of potential combinations. Here we apply a novel big data approach in the evaluation and prediction of drug synergy by using the recently released NCI-ALMANAC. We found that each traditional drug synergy metric (Bliss, Loewe, ZIP, HSA, ALMANAC Score) identified unique synergistic drug pairs with distinct underlying joint mechanisms of action. Leveraging these findings, we developed a suite of context specific drug synergy predictive models for each distinct synergy type and achieved significant predictive performance (AUC = 0.89-0.953). Furthermore, our models accurately identified clinically tested drug pairs and characterized the clinical relevance of each drug synergy metric, with Bliss Independence capturing clinically tested combinations best. Our findings demonstrate that drug synergy can be obtained from numerous unique joint mechanisms of action, captured by different synergy metrics. Additionally, we show that drug synergy, of all kinds, can be predicted with high degrees of accuracy with significant clinical potential. This breakthrough understanding of joint mechanisms of action will allow for the design of rational combinatorial therapeutics on a large scale, across various cancer types.",

    "abstract": "We derived a mouse model in which a mutant form of Nbs1 (Nbs1mid8) exhibits severely impaired binding to the Mre11-Rad50 core of the Mre11 complex. The Nbs1mid8 allele was expressed exclusively in hematopoietic lineages (in Nbs1-/mid8vav mice). Unlike Nbs1flox/floxvav mice, which are Nbs1 deficient in the bone marrow, Nbs1-/mid8vav mice were viable. Nbs1-/mid8vav hematopoiesis was profoundly defective, exhibiting reduced cellularity of thymus and bone marrow, and stage specific blockage of B cell development. Within six months, Nbs1-/mid8 mice developed highly penetrant T cell leukemias. Nbs1-/mid8vav leukemias recapitulated mutational features of human T-ALL, containing mutations in Notch1, Trp53, Bcl6, Bcor, and Ikzf1, suggesting that Nbs1mid8 mice may provide a venue to examine the relationship between the Mre11 complex and oncogene activation in the hematopoietic compartment. Genomic analysis of Nbs1-/mid8vav malignancies showed focal amplification of 9qA2, causing overexpression of MRE11 and CHK1. We propose that overexpression compensates for the meta-stable Mre11-Nbs1mid8 interaction, and that selection pressure for overexpression reflects the essential role of Nbs1 in promoting assembly and activity of the Mre11 complex.",

    "abstract": "Cancer arises through the accumulation of somatic mutations over time. Understanding the sequence of mutation occurrence during cancer progression can assist early and accurate diagnosis and improve clinical decision-making. Here we employ Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), a class of recurrent neural network, to learn the evolution of a tumor through an ordered sequence of mutations. We demonstrate the capacity of LSTMs to learn complex dynamics of the mutational time series governing tumor progression, allowing accurate prediction of the mutational burden and the occurrence of mutations in the sequence. Using the probabilities learned by the LSTM, we simulate mutational data and show that the simulation results are statistically indistinguishable from the empirical data. We identify passenger mutations that are significantly associated with established cancer drivers in the sequence and demonstrate that the genes carrying these mutations are substantially enriched in interactions with the corresponding driver genes. Breaking the network into modules consisting of driver genes and their interactors, we show that these interactions are associated with poor patient prognosis, thus likely conferring growth advantage for tumor progression. Thus, application of LSTM provides for prediction of numerous additional conditional drivers and to reveal hitherto unknown aspects of cancer evolution.\\n\\nSignificanceCancer is caused by the effects of somatic mutations known as drivers. Although a number of major cancer drivers have been identified, it is suspected that many more comparatively rare and conditional drivers exist, and the interactions between different cancer-associated mutations that might be relevant for tumor progression are not well understood. We applied an advanced neural network approach to learn the sequence of mutations and the mutational burden in colon and lung cancers, and to identify mutations that are associated with individual drivers. A significant ordering of driver mutations is demonstrated, and numerous, previously undetected conditional drivers are identified. These findings broaden the existing understanding of the mechanisms of tumor progression and have implications for therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Dual RNA-Seq is the simultaneous transcriptomic analysis of interacting symbionts, for example, in malaria. Potential cross-species interactions identified by correlated gene expression might highlight interlinked signaling, metabolic or gene regulatory pathways in addition to physically interacting proteins. Often, malaria studies address one of the interacting organisms - host or parasite - rendering the other \"contamination\". Here we perform a meta-analysis using such studies for cross-species expression analysis.\n\nWe screened experiments for gene expression from host and Plasmodium. Out of 171 studies in Homo sapiens, Macaca mulatta and Mus musculus, we identified 63 potential studies containing host and parasite data. While 16 studies (1950 samples) explicitly performed dual RNA-Seq, 47 (1398 samples) originally focused on one organism. We found 915 experimental replicates from 20 blood studies to be suitable for co-expression analysis and used orthologs for meta-analysis across different host-parasite systems. Centrality metrics from the derived gene expression networks correlated with gene essentiality in the parasites. We found indications of host immune response to elements of the Plasmodium protein degradation system, an antimalarial drug target. We identified well-studied immune responses in the host with our co-expression networks as our approach recovers known broad processes interlinked between hosts and parasites in addition to individual host and parasite protein associations.\n\nThe set of core interactions represents commonalities between human malaria and its model systems for prioritization in laboratory experiments. Our approach might also allow insights into the transferability of model systems for different pathways in malaria studies.\n\nImportanceMalaria still causes about 400,000 deaths a year and is one the most studied infectious diseases. The disease is studied in mice and monkeys as lab models to derive potential therapeutic intervention in human malaria. Interactions between Plasmodium spp. and its hosts are either conserved across different host-parasite systems or idiosyncratic to those systems. Here we use correlation of gene expression from different RNA-Seq studies to infer common host-parasite interactions across human, mouse and monkey studies. We, firstly, find a set of very conserved interactors, worth further scrutiny in focussed laboratory experiments. Secondly, this work might help assess to which extent experiments and knowledge on different pathways can be transferred from models to humans for potential therapy.",

    "abstract": "Processes of molecular innovation require tinkering and co-option of existing genes. How this occurs in terms of molecular evolution at long evolutionary scales remains poorly understood. Here, we analyse the natural history of a vast group of membrane-associated molecular systems in Bacteria and Archaea - type IV filament super-family (TFF-SF) - that diversified in systems involved in flagellar or twitching motility, adhesion, protein secretion, and DNA natural transformation. We identified such systems in all phyla of the two domains of life, and their phylogeny suggests that they may have been present in the last universal common ancestor. From there, two lineages, a Bacterial and an Archaeal, diversified by multiple gene duplications of the ATPases, gene fission of the integral membrane platform, and accretion of novel components. Surprisingly, we find that the Tad systems originated from the inter-kingdom transfer from Archaea to Bacteria of a system resembling the Epd pilus. The phylogeny and content of ancestral systems suggest that initial bacterial pili were engaged in cell motility and/or DNA transformation. In contrast, specialized protein secretion systems arose much later, and several independent times, in natural history. All these processes of functional diversification were accompanied by genetic rearrangements with implications for genetic regulation and horizontal gene transfer: systems encoded in fewer loci were more frequently exchanged between taxa. Overall, the evolutionary history of the TFF-SF by itself provides an impressive catalogue of the variety of molecular mechanisms involved in the origins of novel functions by tinkering and co-option of cellular machineries.",

    "abstract": "Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) functionally screen thousands of sequences for regulatory activity in parallel. Although MPRAs have been applied to address diverse questions in gene regulation, there has been no systematic comparison of how differences in experimental design influence findings. Here, we screen a library of 2,440 sequences, representing candidate liver enhancers and controls, in HepG2 cells for regulatory activity using nine different approaches (including conventional episomal, STARR-seq, and lentiviral MPRA designs). We identify subtle but significant differences in the resulting measurements that correlate with epigenetic and sequence-level features. We also test this library in both orientations with respect to the promoter, validating en masse that enhancer activity is robustly independent of orientation. Finally, we develop and apply a novel method to assemble and functionally test libraries of the same putative enhancers as 192-mers, 354-mers, and 678-mers, and observe surprisingly large differences in functional activity. This work provides a framework for the experimental design of high-throughput reporter assays, suggesting that the extended sequence context of tested elements, and to a lesser degree the precise assay, influence MPRA results.",
