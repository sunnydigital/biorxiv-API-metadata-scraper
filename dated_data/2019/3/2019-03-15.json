    "abstract": "Anatomical modern humans reached East Asia by >40,000 years ago (kya). However, key questions still remain elusive with regard to the route(s) and the number of wave(s) in the dispersal into East Eurasia. Ancient genomes at the edge of East Eurasia may shed light on the detail picture of peopling to East Eurasia. Here, we analyze the whole-genome sequence of a 2.5 kya individual (IK002) characterized with a typical Jomon culture that started in the Japanese archipelago >16 kya. The phylogenetic analyses support multiple waves of migration, with IK002 forming a lineage basal to the rest of the ancient/present-day East Eurasians examined, likely to represent some of the earliest-wave migrants who went north toward East Asia from Southeast Asia. Furthermore, IK002 has the extra genetic affinity with the indigenous Taiwan aborigines, which may support a coastal route of the Jomon-ancestry migration from Southeast Asia to the Japanese archipelago. This study highlight the power of ancient genomics with the isolated population to provide new insights into complex history in East Eurasia.",

    "abstract": "A growing body of evidence indicates that miRNAs may either drive or suppress oncogenesis. However, little is known about somatic mutations in miRNA genes. To determine the frequency and potential consequences of miRNA gene mutations, we analyzed whole exome sequencing datasets of [~]500 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and [~]500 lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) samples generated in the TCGA. Altogether, we identified >1000 mutations affecting [~]500 different miRNA genes and showed that half of all cancers had at least one such mutation. Mutations occurred in most crucial parts of miRNA precursors, including mature miRNA and seed sequences. We showed that seed mutations strongly affected miRNA:target interactions, drastically changing the pool of predicted targets. Mutations may also affect miRNA biogenesis by changing the structure of miRNA precursors, DROSHA and DICER cleavage sites, and regulatory sequence/structure motifs. We identified 10 significantly overmutated hotspot miRNA genes, including the miR-379 gene in LUAD enriched in mutations in the mature miRNA and regulatory sequences. The occurrence of mutations in the hotspot miRNA genes was also shown experimentally. We present a comprehensive analysis of somatic mutations in miRNA genes and show that some of these genes are mutational hotspots, suggesting their potential role in cancer.",

Synaptic activity is crucial for integrating sensory and effector neural pathways but the role of transcriptional mechanisms as environmental sensors in the nervous system remains unclear. By combining a novel strategy for transcriptomic profiling of enteric neurons with microbiota manipulation, we demonstrate that the transcriptional programs of intestinal neural circuits depend on their anatomical and physiological context. We also identify the ligand-dependent transcription factor Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) is an intrinsic regulator of enteric nervous system output. AhR is instated as a neuronal biosensor in response to microbiota colonization allowing resident enteric neurons to directly monitor and respond to the intestinal microenvironment. We suggest that AhR signaling integrates neuronal activity with host defence mechanisms towards gut homeostasis and health.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryMicrobiota induce expression of AhR in enteric neurons of the distal intestine enabling them to respond to environmental signals.",

Here we used RNA-sequencing, cell imaging and lineage tracing of mouse and human in vitro NSCs to model the generation of cortical neuronal fates. We show that conserved signaling mechanisms regulate the acute transition from proliferative NSCs to committed glutamatergic excitatory neurons. As human telencephalic NSCs developed from pluripotency in vitro, they first transitioned through organizer states that spatially pattern the cortex before generating glutamatergic precursor fates. NSCs derived from multiple human pluripotent lines varied in these early patterning states leading differentially to dorsal or ventral telencephalic fates. This work furthers systematic analysis of the earliest patterning events that generate the major neuronal trajectories of the human telencephalon.",

    "abstract": "Cortical microcircuits exhibit complex recurrent architectures that possess dynamically rich properties. The neurons that make up these microcircuits communicate mainly via discrete spikes, and it is not clear how spikes give rise to dynamics that can be used to perform computationally challenging tasks. In contrast, continuous models of rate-coding neurons can be trained to perform complex tasks. Here, we present a simple framework to construct biologically realistic spiking recurrent neural networks (RNNs) capable of learning a wide range of tasks. Our framework involves training a continuous-variable rate RNN with important biophysical constraints and transferring the learned dynamics and constraints to a spiking RNN in a one-to-one manner. The proposed framework introduces only one additional parameter to establish the equivalence between rate and spiking RNN models. We also study other model parameters related to the rate and spiking networks to optimize the one-to-one mapping. By establishing a close relationship between rate and spiking models, we demonstrate that spiking RNNs could be constructed to achieve similar performance as their counterpart continuous rate networks.",

    "abstract": "Choice behavior is characterized by temporal discounting, i.e., preference for immediate rewards over delayed rewards. Temporal discounting is often dysfunctional in psychiatric disorders, addiction, and eating disorders. However, the underlying neural mechanisms governing temporal discounting are still poorly understood. We found that food deprivation resulted in steep temporal discounting of food rewards, whereas satiation abolished discounting. In addition, optogenetic activation of AgRP-expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus or their axon terminals in the posterior bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) restored temporal discounting in sated mice. Activation of postsynaptic neuropeptide Y receptors (Y1Rs) within the BNST, which is influenced by neuropeptide released by AgRP neurons, was sufficient to restore temporal discounting. These results demonstrate for the first time a profound effect of motivational signals from hypothalamic feeding circuits on temporal discounting and reveal a novel neural circuit that regulates choice behavior.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotes chromosomes are compartmentalized within the nucleus delimited by the double membrane of the nuclear envelope (NE). Defects in the function and structure of the NE are linked to disease1,2. During interphase, the NE organizes the genome and regulates its expression3. As cells enter mitosis, chromosomes are released from the NE, which is then remodelled to form the daughter nuclei at mitotic exit4. Interactions between the NE and chromatin underpinning both interphase and post-mitotic NE functions are executed by inner nuclear membrane (INM) proteins such as members of the evolutionarily conserved chromatin-binding LEM-domain family5-8. How chromatin tethering by these transmembrane proteins is controlled in interphase and if such a regulation contributes to subsequent NE dynamics in mitosis remains unclear. Here we probe these fundamental questions using an emerging model organism, the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces japonicus, which breaks and reforms the NE during mitosis9,10. We show that attachments between heterochromatin and the transmembrane Lem2-Nur1 complex are continuously remodelled in interphase by the ESCRT-III/AAA-ATPase Vps4 machinery. ESCRT-III/Vps4 mediates the release of Lem2-Nur1 from heterochromatin as a prerequisite for the timely progression through mitosis. Failure in this process leads to persistent association of chromosomes with the INM, which prevents Lem2-Nur1 from re-localizing to the sites of NE sealing around the mitotic spindle and severely delays re-establishment of nucleocytoplasmic compartmentalization. Our work establishes the INM transmembrane Lem2-Nur1 complex as a  substrate for ESCRT-III/Vps4 to couple dynamic tethering of chromosomes to the INM with the establishment of nuclear compartmentalization.",

    "abstract": "The autosomal dominant neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL) CLN4 is caused by mutations in the synaptic vesicle (SV) protein CSP, which is a critical co-chaperone of Hsc70 protecting synapses from activity-dependent degeneration. We developed the first animal models of CLN4 by expressing either CLN4 mutant human CSP (hCSP) or Drosophila CSP (dCSP) in fly neurons. Similar to patients, CLN4 mutations induced excessive oligomerization of mutant hCSP and premature lethality in a dose-dependent manner. Instead of being localized to SVs, most CLN4 mutant hCSP abnormally accumulated in axons and somata, and co-localized with ubiquitinated proteins and the prelysosomal markers HRS and LAMP1. Ultrastructurally, abnormal multi-laminar membrane structures were frequently observed in axons and somata next to degenerative abnormalities. The lethality, oligomerization and prelysosomal accumulation induced by CLN4 mutations was attenuated by reducing wild type (WT) dCSP levels and enhanced by increasing WT dCSP or hCSP levels, which indicates that both CLN4 alleles resemble dominant hypermorphic gain of function mutations. Furthermore, reducing the gene dosage of Hsc70 also attenuated CLN4 phenotypes. Taken together, we suggest that CLN4 alleles resemble dominant hypermorphic gain of function mutations that drive excessive oligomerization and impair membrane trafficking.",

Dominant animals showed a clear ocular dominance shift after four days of MD, whereas their submissive cage mates did not. NMDA receptor activation, reduced GABA inhibition, and serotonin transmission were necessary for this plasticity, but not sufficient to explain the difference between dominant and submissive animals. In contrast, prefrontal dopamine concentration was higher in dominant than submissive mice, and systemic manipulation of dopamine transmission bidirectionally changed ocular dominance plasticity. Thus, we could show that a social hierarchical relationship influences ocular dominance plasticity in the visual cortex via higher-order cortices, most likely the medial prefrontal cortex. Further studies will be needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which this regulation takes place.",

However it is not clear how these mechanisms form by trial and error learning. In this paper we present an initial effort to characterize the population activity in monkey prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HPC) during the learning phase of a paired-associate task. To analyze the population data, we introduce the normalized distance, a dimensionless metric that describes the encoding of cognitive variables from the geometrical relationship among neural trajectories in state space. It is found that PFC exhibits a more sustained encoding of task-relevant variables whereas HPC only transiently encodes the identity of the stimuli. We also found partial evidence on the learning-dependent changes for some of the task variables. This study shows the feasibility of using normalized distance as a metric to characterize and compare population level encoding of task variables, and suggests further directions to explore the learning-dependent changes in the population activity.",

Using sub-millimeter-resolution fMRI at 7T we resolved BOLD-response and activation patterns across cortical depth in early sensory cortices to auditory, visual and audiovisual stimuli under auditory or visual attention. In visual cortices, auditory stimulation induced widespread inhibition irrespective of attention, whereas auditory relative to visual attention suppressed mainly central visual field representations. In auditory cortices, visual stimulation suppressed activations, but amplified responses to concurrent auditory stimuli, in a patchy topography. Critically, multisensory interactions in auditory cortices were stronger in deeper laminae, while attentional influences were greatest at the surface. These distinct depth-dependent profiles suggest that multisensory and attentional mechanisms regulate sensory processing via partly distinct circuitries. Our findings are crucial for understanding how the brain regulates information flow across senses to interact with our complex multisensory world.",

Continuous naltrexone treatment (0.0032-0.032 mg/kg/h) effects on heroin, 6-AM, and morphine antinociceptive potency was also determined as a benchmark for minimal vaccine effectiveness.\\n\\nResultsThe heroin-TT vaccine decreased potency of SC heroin (5-fold), IV heroin (3-fold), and IV 6-AM (3-fold) for several weeks without affecting IV morphine or SC and IV fentanyl potency. The control vaccine did not alter potency of any opioid. Naltrexone dose-dependently decreased antinociceptive potency of SC heroin, and treatment with 0.01 mg/kg/h naltrexone produced similar, approximate 8-fold decreases in potencies of SC and IV heroin, IV 6-AM, and IV morphine. The combination of naltrexone and active vaccine was more effective than naltrexone alone to antagonize SC heroin but not IV heroin.\\n\\nConclusionsThe heroin-TT vaccine formulation examined is less effective, but more selective, than chronic naltrexone to attenuate heroin antinociception in rats. Furthermore, these results provide an empirical framework for future preclinical opioid vaccine research to benchmark effectiveness against naltrexone.",

    "abstract": "Recently we have seen a relaxing on the historic restrictions on the use and subsequent research on the cannabis plants, generally classified as Cannabis sativa and Cannabis indica. What research has been performed to date has centered on chemical analysis of plant flower products, namely cannabinoids and various terpenes that directly contribute to phenotypic characteristics of the female flowers. In addition, we have seen many groups recently completing genetic profiles of various plants of commercial value. To date, no comprehensive attempt has been made to profile the proteomes of these plants. In this study we present our initial findings consisting of the identification of 17,269 unique proteins identified from Cannabis plant materials, as well as 6,110 post-translational modifications identified on these proteins. The results presented demonstrate the first steps toward constructing a complete draft map of the Cannabis proteome.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus uses pattern separation and pattern completion in a continuous manner to successfully encode and retrieve memories1,2. However, whether and how cognitive factors might modulate the dynamics between these types of computation is not well understood. Here we examine the role of expectation in shifting the hippocampus to perform pattern separation. Expectation can be built up through multiple contextual exposures leading to prediction (as in a learnt contingency) or through logical deduction based on a previous mnemonic response. Participants first learned a contingency between a cue and an objects category (man-made or natural). Then, at encoding, one third of the cues that preceded the to-be-memorised objects violated the studied rule. At test, participants performed an old/new recognition task with old items (targets) and a set of parametrically manipulated (very similar to dissimilar) new foils for each object. We explored the effects of both contextual expectation, manipulated at initial encoding, and mnemonic-attribution expectation, driven by the mnemonic decisions taken on previous retrieval trials. For example, a target would be unexpected if in a previous trial a similar foil had been erroneously accepted as old. Memory was found to be better for foils of high and mid similarity to contextually unexpected targets at encoding, compared to expected ones. Additionally, violations of mnemonic-attribution expectation also yielded improved memory performance when the level of foil similarity was high. These results suggest that violations of both contextual expectation and mnemonic-attribution expectation engage pattern separation, resulting in better discrimination performance for these items. Importantly, this mechanism is engaged when input differentiation is required in order to make a correct recognition decision.",
