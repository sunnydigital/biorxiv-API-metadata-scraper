    "abstract": "Activity-driven transcription plays an important role in many brain processes, including those underlying memory and epilepsy. Here, we combine the genetic tagging of neuronal nuclei and ribosomes with various sequencing-based techniques to investigate the transcriptional and chromatin changes occurring at hippocampal excitatory neurons upon synchronous activation during status epilepticus and sparse activation during novel context exploration. The transcriptional burst, which affects both nucleus-resident non-coding RNAs and numerous protein-coding genes involved in neuroplasticity, is associated with a dramatic increase in chromatin accessibility of activity-regulated genes and enhancers, de novo binding of activity-regulated transcription factors, augmented promoter-enhancer interactions, and the formation of gene loops that bring together the TSS and TTS of strongly induced genes to sustain the fast re-loading of RNAPII complexes. Remarkably, some chromatin occupancy changes and interactions remain long after neuronal activation and may underlie the changes in neuronal responsiveness and circuit connectivity observed in these neuroplasticity paradigms.",

    "abstract": "Untargeted mass spectrometry is a powerful method for detecting metabolites in biological samples. However, fast and accurate identification of the metabolites structures from MS/MS spectra is still a great challenge. We present a new analysis method, called SF-Matching, that is based on the hypothesis that molecules with similar structural features will exhibit similar fragmentation patterns. We combine information on fragmentation patterns of molecules with shared substructures and then use random forest models to predict whether a given structure can yield a certain fragmentation pattern. These models can then be used to score candidate molecules for a given mass spectrum. For rapid identification, we pre-compute such scores for common biological molecular structure databases. Using benchmarking datasets, we find that our method has similar performance to CSI:FingerID and that very high accuracies can be achieved by combining our method with CSI:FingerID. Rarefaction analysis of the training dataset shows that the performance of our method will increase as more experimental data become available.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of large-scale multi-omics data warrants method development for data integration. Genomic studies from cancer patients have identified epigenetic and genetic regulators - such as methylation marks, somatic mutations, and somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs), among others - as predictive features of cancer outcome. However, identification of \\\"driver genes\\\" associated with a given alteration remains a challenge. To this end, we developed a computational tool, iEDGE, to model cis and trans effects of (epi-)DNA alterations and identify potential cis driver genes, where cis and trans genes denote those genes falling within and outside the genomic boundaries of a given (epi-)genetic alteration, respectively.\\n\\nFirst, iEDGE identifies the cis and trans genes associated with the presence/absence of a particular epi-DNA alteration across samples. Tests of statistical mediation are then performed to determine the cis genes predictive of the trans gene expression. Finally, cis and trans effects are annotated by pathway enrichment analysis to gain insights into the underlying regulatory networks.\\n\\nWe used iEDGE to perform integrative analysis of SCNAs and gene expression data from breast cancer and 18 additional cancer types included in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Notably, cis gene drivers identified by iEDGE were found to be significantly enriched for known driver genes from multiple compendia of validated oncogenes and tumor suppressors, suggesting that the remainder are of equal importance. Furthermore, predicted drivers were enriched for functionally relevant cancer genes with amplification-driven dependencies, which are of potential prognostic and therapeutic value.

    "abstract": "The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) is an important source of neuromodulators in the brain and has been implicated in a wide variety of behavioral and neurological disorders. Although mostly studied as a source of serotonin, the DRN is comprised of multiple cell types that are subdivided into distinct anatomical subregions. However, the complex and incompletely characterized cellular organization of the DRN has impeded efforts to investigate the distinct circuit and behavioral functions of its subdomains. Here we used high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing with in situ hybridization and viral tracing to develop a map of transcriptional and spatial profiles of cells in and around the mouse DRN. Our studies reveal the molecular and spatial organization of multiple neuron subtypes that are the cellular bases of functionally and anatomically distinct serotonergic subsystems, and provide a resource for the design of strategies for further dissection of these subsystems and their diverse functions.",

    "abstract": "Neutrophil migration is essential for inflammatory responses to kill pathogens, however it also causes tissue injury. To discover novel therapeutic targets that modulate neutrophil migration, we performed a neutrophil-specific microRNA overexpression screen in zebrafish, and identified eight microRNAs as potent suppressors of neutrophil migration. Among those, miR-199 decreases neutrophil chemotaxis in zebrafish and human neutrophil-like cells. Intriguingly, in terminally differentiated neutrophils, miR-199 alters the cell cycle-related pathways and directly suppresses cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (cdk2), whose known activity is restricted to cell cycle progression and cell differentiation. Inhibiting CDK2, but not DNA replication, disrupts cell polarity and chemotaxis of zebrafish neutrophils. Chemotaxis of primary human neutrophils are also reduced by CDK2 inhibition. Furthermore, miR-199 overexpression or CDK2 inhibition significantly improves the outcome of lethal systemic inflammation challenges in zebrafish. Together, our results reveal previously unknown functions of miR-199 and CDK2 in regulating neutrophil migration and provide new directions in alleviating systemic inflammation.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummarymiR-199 directly suppresses cdk2 expression, neutrophil chemotaxis and systemic inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Zinc is essential for cellular functions as it is a catalytic and structural component of many proteins. In contrast, cadmium is not required in biological systems and is toxic. Zinc and cadmium levels are closely monitored and regulated as their excess causes cell stress. To maintain homeostasis, organisms induce metal detoxification gene programs through stress responsive transcriptional regulatory complexes. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the MDT-15 subunit of the evolutionarily conserved Mediator transcriptional coregulator is required to induce genes upon exposure to excess zinc and cadmium. However, the regulatory partners of MDT-15 in this response, its role in cellular and physiological stress adaptation, and the putative role mammalian for MED15 in the metal stress responses remain unknown. Here, we show that MDT-15 interacts physically and functionally with the Nuclear Hormone Receptor HIZR-1 to promote molecular, cellular, and organismal adaptation to excess metals. Using gain- and loss-of-function mutants and qPCR and reporter analysis, we find that mdt-15 and hizr-1 cooperate to induce zinc and cadmium responsive genes. Moreover, the two proteins interact physically in yeast-two-hybrid assays and this interaction is enhanced by the addition of zinc or cadmium, the former a known ligand of HIZR-1. Functionally, mdt-15 and hizr-1 mutants show defective storage of excess zinc in the gut, and at the organismal level, mdt-15 mutants are hypersensitive to zinc- and cadmium-induced reductions in egg-laying. Lastly, mammalian MDT-15 orthologs bind genomic regulatory regions of metallothionein and zinc transporter genes in a metal-stimulated fashion, and human MED15 is required to induce a metallothionein gene in lung adenocarcinoma cells exposed to cadmium. Collectively, our data show that mdt-15 and hizr-1 cooperate to regulate metal detoxification and zinc storage and that this mechanism appears to be at least partially conserved in mammals.",

    "abstract": "Pairing of homologous chromosomes represents a critical step of meiosis in nearly all sexually reproducing species. While in some organisms meiotic pairing requires programmed DNA breakage and recombination, in many others it engages homologous chromosomes that remain apparently intact. The mechanistic nature of such recombination-independent pairing represents a fundamental question in molecular genetics. Using  meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA (MSUD) in Neurospora crassa as a model process, we demonstrate the existence of a cardinally different approach to DNA homology recognition in meiosis. The main advantage of MSUD over other experimental systems lies in its ability to identify any relatively short DNA fragment lacking a homologous allelic partner. Here we show that MSUD does not rely on the canonical mechanism of meiotic recombination, yet it is promoted by REC8, a conserved component of the meiotic cohesin complex. We also show that certain patterns of interspersed homology are recognized as pairable during MSUD. Such patterns need to be co-linear and must contain short tracts of sequence identity spaced apart with a periodicity of 21 or 22 base-pairs. By using these values as a guiding parameter in all-atom molecular modeling, we discover that homologous double-stranded DNA molecules can associate by forming quadruplex-based contacts with an interval of 2.5 helical turns, which requires right-handed plectonemic coiling and additional conformational changes in the intervening double-helical segments. These results (i) reconcile genetic and biophysical lines of evidence for the existence of direct homologous dsDNA-dsDNA pairing, (ii) identify a role for this process in initiating post-transcriptional silencing, and (iii) suggest that chromosomes are cross-matched in meiosis by a precise mechanism that operates on intact double-stranded DNA molecules.",

    "abstract": "Age-related hearing loss is associated with cognitive decline and has been proposed as a risk factor for dementia. However, the mechanisms that relate hearing loss to cognitive decline remain elusive. Here, we propose that the impairment of the cochlear amplifier mechanism is associated with structural brain changes and cognitive impairment. Ninety-six subjects aged over 65 years old (63 female and 33 male) were evaluated using brain magnetic resonance imaging, neuropsychological and audiological assessments, including distortion product otoacoustic emissions as a measure of the cochlear amplifier function. All the analyses were adjusted by age, gender and education. The group with cochlear amplifier dysfunction showed greater brain atrophy in the cingulate cortex and in the parahippocampus. In addition, the atrophy of the cingulate cortex was associated with cognitive impairment in episodic and working memories and in language and visuoconstructive abilities. We conclude that the neural abnormalities observed in presbycusis subjects with cochlear amplifier dysfunction extend beyond core auditory network and are associated with cognitive decline in multiple domains. These results suggest that a cochlear amplifier dysfunction in presbycusis is an important mechanism relating hearing impairments to brain atrophy in the extended network of effortful hearing.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing the molecular processes developed by plants to respond to environmental cues is a major task to better understand local adaptation. DNA methylation is a chromatin mark involved in the transcriptional silencing of transposable elements (TEs) and gene expression regulation. While the molecular bases of DNA methylation regulation are now well described, involvement of DNA methylation in plant response to environmental cues remains poorly characterized. Here, using the TE-rich maize genome and analyzing methylome response to prolonged cold at the chromosome and feature scales, we investigate how genomic architecture affects methylome response to stress in a cold-sensitive genotype. Interestingly, we show that cold stress induces a genome-wide methylation increase through the hypermethylation of TE sequences and centromeres. Our work highlights a cytosine context-specific response of TE methylation that depends on TE types, chromosomal location and proximity to genes. The patterns observed can be explained by the parallel transcriptional activation of multiple DNA methylation pathways that methylate TEs in the various chromatin locations where they reside. Our results open new insights into the possible role of genome-wide DNA methylation in phenotypic response to stress.",

However, these algorithms require a user to select a biologically-appropriate latent dimensionality. In practice, most researchers select a single algorithm and latent dimensionality. We sought to determine the extent by which using multiple dimensionalities across ensemble compression models improves biological representations.\\n\\nResultsWe compressed gene expression data from three large datasets consisting of adult normal tissue, adult cancer tissue, and pediatric cancer tissue. We compressed these data into many latent dimensionalities ranging from 2 to 200. We observed various tradeoffs across latent dimensionalities and compression models. For example, we observed high model stability between principal components analysis (PCA), independent components analysis (ICA), and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). We identified more unique biological signatures in ensembles of denoising autoencoder (DAE) and variational autoencoder (VAE) models in intermediate latent dimensionalities. However, we captured the most pathway-associated features using all compressed features across algorithms and dimensionalities. Optimized at different latent dimensionalities, compression models detect generalizable gene expression signatures representing sex, neuroblastoma MYCN amplification, and cell types. In two supervised machine learning tasks, compressed features optimized predictions at different latent dimensionalities.\\n\\nConclusionsThere is no single best latent dimensionality or compression algorithm for analyzing gene expression data.

Using whole genome sequencing data of both affected calves did not show mutations in the candidate regions of ZRS and pZRS or in candidate genes associated with polydactyly, syndactyly and polysyndactyly in other species. Two indels, which are located in XIRP1 within a common haplotype, were highly associated with the two phenotypes. Bioinformatic analyses retrieved an interaction between XIRP1 and FGFR1, CTNNB1 and CTNND1 supporting a link between the XIRP1 variants and embryonic limb patterning. The heterozygous haplotype was highly associated with the present polydactylous phenotypes due to dominant mode of inheritance with an incomplete penetrance in Holstein cattle.",

    "abstract": "Intranasal mucosal vaccines are of interest in that they may induce protective mucosal immune responses. Activation of lung antigen presenting cells (APCs), a phenotyoically and functionally heterogeneous cell population located at distinct mucosal sites, may be key to the immunogenicity of such vaccines. Characterizing responsiveness of newborn lung APCs to adjuvants may inform design of efficacious intranasal vaccines for early life, when most infections occur. We characterized APCs from neonatal (<7 days of life) and adult (6-8 weeks of age) mice. Neonatal mice displayed a relatively high abundance of alveolar macrophages (AMs), with lower percentages of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), CD103+ (cDC1) and CD11b+ (cDC2) DCs. Furthermore, neonatal CD103+ and CD11b+ DC subsets demonstrated an inverse expression of maturation markers as compared to adult mice. Upon stimulation of lung APC subsets with a panel of pattern recognition receptor (PRR), including TLR and STING, agonists, CD11c+ enriched cells from neonatal and adult mice lungs demonstrated distinct maturation profiles. The TLR5 ligand, flagellin, was most effective at activating neonatal lung APCs, inducing significantly higher expression of maturation markers on CD103+ (cDC1) and CD11b+ (cDC2) subsets. Intranasal administration of flagellin induced a distinct migration of CD103+ and CD11b+ DC subsets to the mediastinal lymph nodes (mLNs) of neonatal mice. Overall, these findings highlight age specific differences in the maturation and responsiveness of lung APC subsets to different PRR agonists. The unique efficacy of flagellin in enhancing lung APC activity suggests that it may serve as an effective adjuvant for early life mucosal vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Many fast renewing tissues are characterized by a hierarchical cellular architecture, with tissue specific stem cells at the root of the cellular hierarchy and differentiating into a whole range of specialized cells. There is increasing evidence that tumors are structured in a very similar way, mirroring the hierarchical structure of the host tissue. In some tissues, differentiated cells can also revert to the stem cell phenotype, which increases the risk that cells that have already acquired mutations lead to long lasting clones in the tissue. Recently, the modelling community has paid special attention to the consequences of de-differentiation on cellular hierarchies. However, the adaptive significance of de-differentiation is still poorly understood and thus it is unclear under which circumstances de-differentiating cells will invade a tissue. To address this, we developed mathematical models to investigate how de-differentiation could be selected as an adaptive mechanism in the context of cellular hierarchies. We consider the cases of stepwise and jumpwise de-differentiation in this study. Our results show that the emergence of de-differentiation is driven by the combination of the properties of the cellular hierarchy and the de-differentiation pattern and derive thresholds for which de-differentiation is expected to emerge.",

    "abstract": "The role of the lymphatic system in brain function and/or dysfunction has long been an enigma. However, recent reports that meningeal lymphatic vessels exist within the mouse and human brain, as well as evidence that mouse meningeal lymphatic vessels play a role in clearing the toxic amyloid-beta peptide connected with Alzheimers disease (AD), may herald novel diagnostic and therapeutic avenues. Here, we explore new evidence connecting the lymphatic system of the brain with AD. In particular, we focus on new findings showing that meningeal lymphatic vessels play a role in drainage of cerebrospinal fluid and egress of immune cells from the brain, and that disrupting this vessel system leads to accumulation of amyloid - beta peptide and cognitive dysfunction. We also discuss the hypothesis that apolipoprotein E isoform e4 (APO E4) [boxh] the leading genetic risk for developing AD [boxh] is involved in meningeal lymphatic vessel function. By reanalyzing previously published RNA-Seq data, we show that APO E4 knock-in microglia cells express lower levels of genes representing lymphatic markers (a phenomenon we call \\\"attenuated lymphaticness\\\") and of genes in which functional missense mutations are linked to lymphedema. Accordingly, we propose the hypothesis that APO E4 is involved in the shrinkage of lymphatic vessels. This notion could lead, if verified by additional anatomic and mechanistic data, to the concept that APO E4-related AD (such as in late onset AD or trisomy 21-related AD) is related to lymphosclerosis coupled with lymphedema.",

    "abstract": "A platform for highly parallel direct sequencing of native RNA strands was recently described by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT); in order to assess overall performance in transcript-level investigations, the technology was applied for sequencing sets of synthetic transcripts as well as a yeast transcriptome. However, despite initial efforts it remains crucial to further investigate characteristics of ONT native RNA sequencing when applied to much more complex transcriptomes. Here we thus undertook extensive native RNA sequencing of polyA+ RNA from two human cell lines, and thereby analysed ~5.2 million aligned native RNA reads which consisted of a total of ~4.6 billion bases. To enable informative comparisons, we also performed relevant ONT direct cDNA- and Illumina-sequencing. We find that while native RNA sequencing does enable some of the anticipated advantages, key unexpected aspects hamper its performance, most notably the quite frequent inability to obtain full-length transcripts from single reads, as well as difficulties to unambiguously infer their true transcript of origin. While characterising issues that need to be addressed when investigating more complex transcriptomes, our study highlights that with some defined improvements, native RNA sequencing could be an important addition to the mammalian transcriptomics toolbox.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons. While several inherited pathogenic mutations have been identified as causative, the vast majority of cases are sporadic with no family history of disease. Thus, for the majority of ALS cases, a specific causal abnormality is not known and the disease may be a product of multiple inter-related pathways contributing to varying degrees in different ALS patients. Using unsupervised machine learning algorithms, we stratified the transcriptomes of 148 ALS decedent cortex tissue samples into three distinct and robust molecular subtypes. The largest cluster, identified in 61% of patient samples, displayed hallmarks of oxidative and proteotoxic stress. Another 20% of the ALS patient samples exhibited high levels of retrotransposon expression and other signatures of TDP-43 dysfunction. Finally, a third group showed predominant signatures of glial activation (19%). Together these results demonstrate that at least three distinct molecular signatures contribute to ALS disease. While multiple dysregulated components and pathways comprising these clusters have previously been implicated in ALS pathogenesis, unbiased analysis of this large survey demonstrated that sporadic ALS patient tissues can be segregated into distinct molecular subsets.",

    "abstract": "Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and obesity are frequently comorbid, genetically correlated, and share brain substrates. The biological mechanisms driving this association are unclear, but candidate systems, like dopaminergic neurotransmission and circadian rhythm, have been suggested. Our aim was to identify the biological mechanisms underpinning the genetic link between ADHD and obesity measures and investigate associations of overlapping genes with brain volumes. We tested the association of dopaminergic and circadian rhythm gene sets with ADHD, body mass index (BMI), and obesity (using GWAS data of N=53,293, N=681,275, and N=98,697, respectively). We then conducted genome-wide ADHD-BMI and ADHD-obesity gene-based meta-analyses, followed by pathway enrichment analyses. Finally, we tested the association of ADHD-BMI overlapping genes with brain volumes (primary GWAS data N=10,720-10,928; replication data N=9,428). The dopaminergic gene set was associated with both ADHD (P=5.81x10-3) and BMI (P=1.63x10-5), the circadian rhythm was associated with BMI (P=1.28x10-3). The genome-wide approach also implicated the dopaminergic system, as the Dopamine-DARPP32 Feedback in cAMP Signaling pathway was enriched in both ADHD-BMI and ADHD-obesity results. The ADHD-BMI overlapping genes were associated with putamen volume (P=7.7x10-3; replication data P=3.9x10-2) - a brain region with volumetric reductions in ADHD and BMI and linked to inhibitory control. Our findings suggest that dopaminergic neurotransmission, partially through DARPP-32-dependent signaling and involving the putamen, is a key player underlying the genetic overlap between ADHD and obesity measures. Uncovering shared etiological factors underlying the frequently observed ADHD-obesity comorbidity may have important implications in terms of prevention and/or efficient treatment of these conditions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe incidence of dementia and cognitive decline is increasing with no therapy or cure. One of the reasons treatment remains elusive is because there are various pathologies that contribute to age-related cognitive decline. Specifically, with Alzheimers disease, targeting to reduce amyloid beta plaques and phosphorylated tau aggregates in clinical trials has not yielded results to slow symptomology, suggesting a new approach is needed. Interestingly, exercise has been proposed as a potential therapeutic intervention to improve brain health and reduce the risk for dementia, however the benefits throughout aging are not well understood.\\n\\nResultsTo better understand the effects of exercise, we preformed transcriptional profiling on young (1-2 months) and midlife (12 months) C57BL/6J (B6) male mice after 12 weeks of voluntary running. Data was compared to age-matched sedentary controls. Interestingly, the midlife running group naturally broke into two cohorts based on distance ran - either running a lot and more intensely (high runners) or running less and less intensely (low runners). Midlife high runners had lower LDL cholesterol as well as lower adiposity (%fat) compared to sedentary, than midlife low runners compared to sedentary suggesting more intense running lowered systemic markers of risk for age-related diseases including dementias. Differential gene analysis of transcriptional profiles generated from the cortex and hippocampus showed thousands of differentially expressed (DE) genes when comparing young runners to sedentary controls. However, only a few hundred genes were DE comparing either midlife high runners or midlife low runners to midlife sedentary controls. This indicates that, in our study, the effects of running are reduced through aging. Gene set enrichment analyses identified enrichment of genes involved in extracellular matrix (ECM), vascular remodeling and angiogenesis in young runners but not midlife runners. These genes are known to be expressed in multiple vascular-related cell types including astrocytes, endothelial cells, pericytes and smooth muscle cells.\\n\\nConclusionsTaken together these results suggest running may best serve as a preventative measure to reduce risk for cerebrovascular decline. Ultimately, this work shows that exercise may be more effective to prevent dementia if introduced at younger ages.",

In order to provide some glimpses on the connections between the gut microbiome layout and host behavior, we profiled the phylogenetic composition and structure of the canine gut microbiome of dogs with aggressive (n = 17), phobic (n = 15) and normal behavior (n = 17). According to our findings, aggressive behavioral disorder was found to be characterized by a peculiar gut microbiome structure, with high biodiversity and enrichment in generally subdominant bacterial genera. On the other hand, phobic dogs were enriched in Lactobacillus, a bacterial genus with known probiotic and psychobiotic properties. Although further studies are needed to validate our findings, our work supports the intriguing opportunity that different behavioral phenotypes in dogs may be associated with peculiar gut microbiome layouts, suggesting possible connections between the gut microbiome and the central nervous system and indicating the possible adoption of probiotic interventions aimed at restoring a balanced host-symbiont interplay for mitigating behavioral disorders.",

    "abstract": "We present an unprecedentedly comprehensive characterization of protein dynamics across early development in Xenopus laevis, available immediately via a convenient Web portal. This resource allows interrogation of the protein expression data in conjunction with other data modalities such as genome wide mRNA expression. This study provides detailed data for absolute levels of [~]14K unique Xenopus proteins representing homologues of [~]9K unique human genes - a rich resource for developmental biologists.
