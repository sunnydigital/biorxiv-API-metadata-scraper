    "abstract": "Notch signaling controls proliferation of multipotent pancreatic progenitor cells (MPCs) and their segregation into bipotent progenitors (BPs) and unipotent pro-acinar cells (PACs). Here we uncover fast ultradian oscillations in the ligand Dll1, and the transcriptional effector Hes1, which proved crucial for MPC expansion. Conversely Jag1, a uniformly expressed ligand, curbed MPC growth, but as expression later segregated to PACs it proved critical for specifying all but the most proximal 5% of BPs, while BPs were entirely lost in Jag1, Dll1 double mutants. Moreover, experimentally induced changes in Hes1 oscillation parameters was associated with selective adoption of BP or PAC fates. Anatomically, ductal morphogenesis and organ architecture is minimally perturbed in Jag1 mutants until later stages, when ductal remodeling fails and signs of acinar-to-ductal metaplasia appear. Our study uncovers oscillating Notch activity in the developing pancreas, which along with modulation by Jag1 is required to coordinate MPC growth and fate.",

    "abstract": "The mosquitoes Aedes aegypti (L.) and Ae. albopictus Skuse are the major vectors of dengue, Zika, yellow fever and chikungunya viruses worldwide. Wolbachia, an endosymbiotic bacterium present in many insects, is being utilized in novel vector control strategies to manipulate mosquito life history and vector competence to curb virus transmission. Earlier studies have found that Wolbachia is commonly detected in Ae. albopictus but sporadically detected in Ae. aegypti. In this study, we used a two-step PCR assay to detect Wolbachia in wild-collected samples of Ae. aegypti. The PCR products were sequenced to validate amplicons and identify Wolbachia strains. A Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was developed and used for detecting Wolbachia in selected mosquito specimens as well. We found Wolbachia in 85/148 (57.4%) wild specimens of Ae. aegypti from various cities in New Mexico and in 2/46 (4.3%) wild specimens of Ae. aegypti from St. Augustine, Florida. We did not detect Wolbachia in 94 samples of Ae. aegypti from Deer Park, Harris County, Texas. Wolbachia detected in Ae. aegypti from both New Mexico and Florida was the wAlbB strain of Wolbachia pipientis. A Wolbachia positive colony of Ae. aegypti was established from pupae collected in Las Cruces, New Mexico in 2018.",

    "abstract": "Despite decades of investigation into how antibiotics affect isolated bacteria, it remains highly challenging to predict consequences for communities in complex environments such as the human intestine. Interspecies interactions can impact antibiotic activity through alterations to the extracellular environment that change bacterial physiology. By measuring key metabolites and environmental pH, we determined that metabolic cross-feeding among members of the fruit fly gut microbiota drives changes in antibiotic sensitivity in vitro. Co-culturing of Lactobacillus plantarum with Acetobacter species induced tolerance to rifampin. Mechanistically, we found that acetobacters counter the acidification driven by L. plantarum production of lactate, and that pH shifts during stationary phase were sufficient to drive rifampin tolerance in L. plantarum monocultures. The key Lactobacillus physiological parameter related to tolerance was a reduction in lag time exiting stationary phase, opposite to a previously identified mode of tolerance to ampicillin in E. coli. Lactobacillus tolerance to erythromycin also depended on growth status and pH, suggesting that our findings generalize to other antibiotics. Finally, tolerance of L. plantarum to rifampin varied spatially across the fruit fly gut. This mechanistic understanding of the coupling among interspecies interactions, environmental pH, and antibiotic tolerance enables future predictions of growth and the effects of antibiotics in more complex communities and within hosts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract.An undesirable side effect of drugs are cardiac arrhythmias, in particular a condition called torsades de pointes. Current paradigms for drug safety evaluation are costly, lengthy, and conservative, and impede efficient drug development. Here we combine multiscale experiment and simulation, high-performance computing, and machine learning to create an easy-to-use risk assessment diagram to quickly and reliable stratify the pro-arrhythmic potential of new and existing drugs. We capitalize on recent developments in machine learning and integrate information across ten orders of magnitude in space and time to provide a holistic picture of the effects of drugs, either individually or in combination with other drugs. We show, both experimentally and computationally, that drug-induced arrhythmias are dominated by the interplay of two currents with opposing effects: the rapid delayed rectifier potassium current and the L-type calcium current. Using Gaussian process classification, we create a classifier that stratifies safe and arrhythmic domains for any combinations of these two currents. We demonstrate that our classifier correctly identifies the risk categories of 23 common drugs, exclusively on the basis of their concentrations at 50% current block. Our new risk assessment diagram explains under which conditions blocking the L-type calcium current can delay or even entirely suppress arrhythmogenic events. Using machine learning in drug safety evaluation can provide a more accurate and comprehensive mechanistic assessment of the pro-arrhythmic potential of new drugs. Our study shapes the way towards establishing science-based criteria to accelerate drug development, design safer drugs, and reduce heart rhythm disorders.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal activity is responsible for large energy consumption within the brain. However, the cellular mechanisms draining ATP upon the arrival of a stimulus are yet to be explored systematically at the post-synapse. Here we provide evidence that a significant fraction of ATP is consumed upon glutamate stimulation to energize the mGluR-induced protein synthesis. We find that both mGluR and NMDAR alter protein synthesis and ATP consumption with distinct kinetics at the synaptic-dendritic compartments. While mGluR activation leads to a rapid and sustained reduction in the neuronal ATP level, NMDAR activation has no immediate impact on the same. ATP consumption correlates inversely to the kinetics of protein synthesis for both the receptors. We observe a persistent elevation in protein synthesis within 5 minutes of mGluR activation and robust inhibition of the same within 2 minutes of NMDAR activation, assessed by the phosphorylation status of eEF2 and metabolic labeling. However, a delayed protein synthesis-dependent ATP expenditure ensues after 15 minutes of NMDAR activation. We identify a central role for AMPK in this correlation between protein synthesis and ATP consumption. AMPK is dephosphorylated and inhibited upon mGluR activation while it was rapidly phosphorylated upon NMDAR activation. Perturbing AMPK activity disrupts the receptor-specific modulations of eEF2 phosphorylation and protein synthesis. Therefore, our observations suggest that the glutamate receptors required modulating the AMPK-eEF2 signaling axis to alter neuronal protein synthesis and bioenergetics.\n\nShort SummaryStimulation of glutamate receptors induces robust protein synthesis within cortical neurons and consumes a significantly large fraction of cellular ATP.

    "abstract": "Molecular recognition of the amphiphilic electron carrier ubiquinone (Q) by respiratory complexes is a fundamental part of electron transfer chains in mitochondria and many bacteria. The primary respiratory complex I binds Q in a long and narrow protein chamber to catalyse its reduction. But, the binding mechanism and the role of chamber hydration in substrate selectivity and stability are unclear. Here, large-scale atomistic molecular dynamics simulations and estimated free energy profiles are used to characterize in detail the binding mechanism to complex I of Q with short and with long isoprenoid tails. A highly stable binding site with two different poses near the chamber exit and a secondary reactive site near the N2 iron-sulfur cluster are found which may lead to an alternative Q redox chemistry and help to explain complex I reactivity. The binding energetics depends mainly on polar interactions of the Q-head and on the counterbalanced hydration of Q-tail isoprenoid units and hydrophobic residues inside the protein chamber. Selectivity upon variation of tail length arises by shifting the hydration balance. This internal hydration mechanism may have implications for binding of amphiphilic molecules to cavities in other membrane proteins.",

    "abstract": "Misfolded protein aggregates can disrupt cellular homeostasis and cause toxicity, a hallmark of numerous neurodegenerative diseases. Protein quality control by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy is vital for clearance of aggregates and maintenance of cellular homeostasis1. Autophagy receptor proteins bridge the interaction between ubiquitinated proteins and the autophagy machinery allowing selective elimination of cargo2. Aggrephagy is critical to protein quality control, but how aggregates are recognized and targeted for degradation is not well understood. Here we examine the requirements for 5 autophagy receptor proteins: OPTN, NBR1, p62, NDP52, and TAX1BP1 in proteotoxic stress-induced aggregate clearance. Endogenous TAX1BP1 is both recruited to and required for the clearance of stress-induced aggregates while overexpression of TAX1BP1 increases aggregate clearance through autophagy. Furthermore, TAX1BP1 depletion sensitizes cells to proteotoxic stress and Huntingtons disease-linked polyQ proteins, whereas TAX1BP1 overexpression clears cells of polyQ protein aggregates by autophagy. We propose a broad role for TAX1BP1 in the clearance of cytotoxic proteins, thus identifying a new mode of clearance of protein inclusions.",

    "abstract": "Dead End (DND1) is an RNA-binding protein essential for germline development through its role in post-transcriptional gene regulation. The molecular mechanisms behind selection and regulation of its targets are unknown. Here, we present the solution structure of DND1s tandem RNA Recognition Motifs (RRMs) bound to AU-rich RNA. The structure reveals how an NYAYUNN element is specifically recognized, reconciling seemingly contradictory sequence motifs discovered in recent genome-wide studies. RRM1 acts as a main binding platform, including atypical extensions to the canonical RRM fold. RRM2 acts cooperatively with RRM1, capping the RNA using an unusual binding pocket, leading to an unprecedented mode of tandem RRM-RNA recognition. We show that the consensus motif is sufficient to mediate upregulation of a reporter gene in human cells and that this process depends not only on RNA binding by the RRMs, but also on DND1s double-stranded RNA binding domain (dsRBD), which is dispensable for target binding in cellulo. Our results point to a model where DND1 target selection is mediated by a non-canonical mode of AU-rich RNA recognition by the tandem RRMs and a role for the dsRBD in the recruitment of effector complexes responsible for target regulation.",

    "abstract": "Inhalation of Francisella tularensis (Ft) causes pneumonic tularemia in humans, a severe disease with a 30-60% mortality rate. Reproducible delivery of aerosolized virulent bacteria in relevant animal models is essential for evaluating medical countermeasures. Here we developed optimized protocols for infecting New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits with aerosols containing Ft. We evaluated relative humidity, aerosol exposure technique, and bacterial culture conditions to optimize spray factor (SF), a central metric of aerosolization. This optimization reduced both inter-and intra-daily variability and were applicable to multiple isolates of Ft. Further improvements in the accuracy and precision of the inhaled pathogen dose were achieved through enhanced correlation of bacterial culture OD and CFU. Plethysmograph data collected during exposures found that respiratory function varied considerably between rabbits, was not a function of weight, and did not improve with acclimation to the system. Vaccine Strain (LVS)-vaccinated rabbits were challenged via aerosol with human-virulent Ft SCHU S4 that had been cultivated in either Mueller Hinton Broth (MHB) or Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth. LVS-vaccinated animals challenged with MHB-SCHU S4 experienced short febrile periods (median: 3.2 days), limited weight loss (< 5%), and longer median survival times (~18 d) that were significantly different than unvaccinated controls. In contrast, LVS-vaccinated rabbits challenged with BHI SCHU S4 experienced longer febrile periods (median: 5.5 days), greater weight loss (> 10%), and median survival times that were not significantly different than unvaccinated controls. These studies highlight the importance of careful characterization and optimization of protocols for aerosol challenge with pathogenic agents.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are a major healthcare concern, especially infective endocarditis (IE). Standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) defines most MRSA strains as  resistant to {beta}-lactams, often leading to use of costly and/or toxic treatment regimens. In this investigation, five prototype MRSA strains, representing the range of genotypes in current clinical circulation, were studied. We identified two distinct MRSA phenotypes upon AST using standard media, with or without sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) supplementation: one highly susceptible to the anti-staphylococcal {beta}-lactams, oxacillin and cefazolin ( NaHCO3-responsive) and one resistant to such agents ( NaHCO3-nonresponsive). These phenotypes accurately predicted clearance profiles of MRSA from target tissues in experimental MRSA IE treated with each {beta}-lactam. Mechanistically, NaHCO3 reduced expression of two key genes involved in the MRSA phenotype, mecA and sarA, leading to decreased production of penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 2a (that mediates methicillin resistance), in NaHCO3-responsive (but not in NaHCO3-nonresponsive) strains. Moreover, both cefazolin and oxacillin synergistically killed NaHCO3-responsive strains in the presence of the host defense antimicrobial peptide (LL-37) in NaHCO3-supplemented media. These findings suggest that AST of MRSA strains in NaHCO3-containing media may potentially identify infections caused by NaHCO3-responsive strains that are appropriate for {beta}-lactam therapy.",

    "abstract": "It is generally assumed that translation efficiency is governed by translation initiation. However, the efficiency of protein synthesis is regulated by multiple factors including tRNA abundance, codon composition, mRNA motifs and amino-acid sequence1-4. These factors influence the rate of protein synthesis beyond the initiation phase of translation, typically by modulating the rate of peptide-bond formation and to a lesser extent that of translocation. The slowdown in translation during the early elongation phase, known as the 5 translational ramp, likely contributes to the efficiency of protein synthesis 5-9. Multiple mechanisms, which could explain the molecular basis for this translational ramp, have been proposed that include tRNA abundance bias6,9, the rate of translation initiation10-15, mRNA and ribosome structure 11,12,14,16-18, or retention of initiation factors during early elongation events 19. Here, we show that the amount of synthesized protein (translation efficiency) depends on a short translational ramp that comprises the first 5 codons in mRNA. Using a library of more than 250,000 reporter sequences combined with in vitro and in vivo protein expression assays, we show that differences in the short ramp can lead to 3 to 4 orders of magnitude changes in protein abundance. The observed difference is not dependent on tRNA abundance, efficiency of translation initiation, or overall mRNA structure. Instead, we show that translation is regulated by amino-acid-sequence composition and local mRNA sequence. Single-molecule measurements of translation kinetics indicate substantial pausing of ribosome and abortion of protein synthesis on the 4th or 5th codon for distinct amino acid or nucleotide compositions. Introduction of preferred sequence motifs, only at the exact positions within the mRNA, improves protein synthesis for recombinant proteins, indicating an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for controlling translational efficiency.",

Saccharomyces cerevisiae Tel1 is a homolog of mammalian ATM kinase that plays an auxiliary role in DDC signaling. {gamma}H2A, equivalent to {gamma}H2AX in mammals, is an early chromatin mark induced by DNA damage that is recognized by a group of DDC and DNA repair factors. We find that both Tel1 and {gamma}H2A negatively impact G2/M checkpoint in response to DNA topoisomerase I poison camptothecin independently of each other. {gamma}H2A also negatively regulates DDC induced by DNA alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate. These results, together with prior findings demonstrating positive or no roles of Tel1 and {gamma}H2A in DDC in response to other DNA damaging agents such as phleomycin and ionizing radiation, suggest that Tel1 and {gamma}H2A have DNA damage-specific effects on DDC. We present data indicating that Tel1 acts in the same pathway as Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex to suppress CPT induced DDC possibly by repairing topoisomerase I-DNA crosslink. On the other hand, we find evidence consistent with the notion that {gamma}H2A regulates DDC by mediating the competitive recruitment of DDC mediator Rad9 and DNA repair factor Rtt107 to sites of DNA damage. We propose that {gamma}H2A serves to create a dynamic balance between DDC and DNA repair that is influenced by the nature of DNA damage.",

    "abstract": "The Staphylococcus aureus type VII secretion system (T7SS) exports several proteins that are pivotal for bacterial virulence. The mechanisms underlying T7SS-mediated staphylococcal survival during infection nevertheless remain unclear. Here we show that the absence of EsxC, a small secreted effector implicated in bacterial persistence, results in cell membrane defects in S. aureus. Interestingly, isogenic mutants lacking EsxC, other T7SS effectors EsxA and EsxB, or the membrane-bound ATPase EssC, are more sensitive to killing by the host-derived antimicrobial fatty acid, linoleic acid (LA), compared to the wild-type (WT). LA induces more cell membrane damage in the T7SS mutants compared to the WT. Although WT and mutant strains did not differ in their ability to bind labelled LA, membrane lipid profiles show that T7SS mutants are less able to incorporate LA into their membrane phospholipids. Furthermore, proteomic analyses of WT and mutant cell fractions reveal that, in addition to compromising membranes, T7SS defects induce oxidative stress and hamper their response to LA challenge. Thus, our findings indicate that T7SS is crucial for S. aureus membrane integrity and homeostasis, which is critical when bacteria encounter antimicrobial fatty acids.",

    "abstract": "Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), a non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS), result in a range of diseases, including self-limiting gastroenteritis, bacteremia, enteric fever, and focal infections representing a major disease burden worldwide. There is still a significant portion of Salmonella genes whose functional basis to overcome host innate defense mechanisms, consequently causing disease in host, largely remains unknown. Here, we have applied a high-throughput transposon sequencing (Tn-seq) method to unveil the genetic factors required for the growth or survival of S. Typhimurium under various host stressors simulated in vitro. A highly saturating Tn5 library of S. Typhimurium 14028s was subjected to selection during growth in the presence of short chain fatty acid (100 mM propionate), osmotic stress (3% NaCl) or oxidative stress (1 mM H2O2) or survival in extreme acidic pH (30 min in pH3) or starvation (12 days in 1X PBS). We have identified an overlapping set of 339 conditionally essential genes (CEGs) required by S. Typhimurium to overcome these host insults. Interestingly, entire eight genes encoding F0F1-ATP synthase subunit proteins were required for fitness in all five stresses. Intriguingly, total 88 genes in Salmonella pathogenicity island (SPI), including SPI-1, SPI-2, SPI-3, SPI-5, SPI-6 and SPI-11 are also required for fitness under the in vitro conditions evaluated in this study. Additionally, by comparative analysis of the genes identified in this study and the genes previously shown to be required for in vivo fitness, we identified novel genes (marBCT, envF, barA, hscA, rfaQ, rfbI and putative proteins STM14_1138, STM14_3334, STM14_4825, and STM_5184) that has compelling potential to be exploited as vaccine development and/or drug target to curb the Salmonella infection.",

    "abstract": "Biofilm formation by Bacillus subtilis is a communal process that culminates in the formation of architecturally complex multicellular communities. Here we reveal that the transition of the biofilm into a non-expanding phase constitutes a distinct step in the process of biofilm development. Using genetic analysis we show that B. subtilis strains lacking the ability to synthesize pulcherriminic acid form biofilms that sustain the expansion phase, thereby linking pulcherriminic acid to growth arrest. However, production of pulcherriminic acid is not sufficient to block expansion of the biofilm. It needs to be secreted into the extracellular environment where it chelates Fe3+ from the growth medium in a non-enzymatic reaction. Utilizing mathematical modelling and a series of experimental methodologies we show that when the level of freely available iron in the environment drops below a critical threshold, expansion of the biofilm stops. Bioinformatics analysis allows us to identify the genes required for pulcherriminic acid synthesis in other Firmicutes but the patchwork presence both within and across closely related species suggests loss of these genes through multiple independent recombination events. The seemingly counterintuitive self-restriction of growth led us to explore if there were any benefits associated pulcherriminic acid production. We identified that pulcherriminic acid producers can prevent invasion from neighbouring communities through the generation of an \\\"iron free\\\" zone thereby addressing the paradox of pulcherriminic acid production by B. subtilis.\\n\\nSignificanceUnderstanding the processes that underpin the mechanism of biofilm formation, dispersal, and inhibition are critical to allow exploitation and to understand how microbes thrive in the environment. Here, we reveal that the formation of an extracellular iron chelate restricts the expansion of a biofilm. The countering benefit to self-restriction of growth is protection of an environmental niche. These findings highlight the complex options and outcomes that bacteria need to balance in order to modulate their local environment to maximise colonisation, and therefore survival.",

    "abstract": "The E. coli RND transporter MdtEF-TolC is a tri-partite efflux pump that exports toxic substances. Little is known of the full range of substrate specificity of the anaerobic efflux pump, but MdtF shares similar homology and substrate specificity to the major RND efflux protein AcrB. To determine the substrate range of the anaerobic efflux pump MdtEF-TolC, E. coli mutants were exposed to 210 different biocides, and growth was monitored. This approach was used to validate AcrAB-TolC substrates and discover new chemicals transported by the major antibiotic efflux protein. Results showed that overexpression of MdtEF conferred resistance to the same substrates as AcrAB-TolC, but were limited to cationic amino-based biocides. Alignment of the amino acids lining the distal pocket of MdtF and AcrB revealed a more acidic isoelectric point (pI) of an order of magnitude in MdtF, whereas the proximal pocket and external cleft were homologous and displayed identical pIs. This analysis suggests that pH, which determines acid-base speciation, and the distal pocket surface proteins play a role in MdtF substrate specificity.\\n\\nImportanceHigh-throughput screening of E. coli mutants revealed that the substrates of the anaerobic efflux pump MdtEF-TolC are the same cationic biocides exported by AcrAB-TolC. Comparison of the protein sequences of the distal pocket, proximal pocket, and external cleft of the two RND proteins showed homology in amino acid surface charge and isoelectric point. Residue differences within the distal pocket are responsible for a more acidic pI and greater negative charge of the inner membrane protein MdtF surface, and support the findings of transport of cationic substances.",

Our study investigated the prevalence of genes with expression distributions that are non-Normal in three different tumor types from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Surprisingly, less than 50% of all genes were Normally-distributed, with other distributions including Gamma, Bimodal, Cauchy, and Lognormal were represented. Relevant information about cancer biology was captured by the genes with non-Normal gene expression. When used for classification, the set of non-Normal genes were able to discriminate between cancer patients with poor versus good survival status.

    "abstract": "Background and PurposeAccurate identification of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patient cohorts is essential for a wide range of clinical investigations. Automated phenotyping methods that leverage electronic health records (EHRs) represent a fundamentally new approach cohort identification. Unfortunately, the current generation of these algorithms is laborious to develop, poorly generalize between institutions, and rely on incomplete information. We systematically compared and evaluated the ability of several machine learning algorithms and case-control combinations to phenotype acute ischemic stroke patients using data from an EHR.\\n\\nMethodsUsing structured patient data from the EHR at a tertiary-care hospital system, we built machine learning models to identify patients with AIS based on 75 different case-control and classifier combinations. We then determined the models classification ability for AIS on an internal validation set, and estimated the prevalence of AIS patients across the EHR. Finally, we externally validated the ability of the models to detect self-reported AIS patients without AIS diagnosis codes using the UK Biobank.\\n\\nResultsAcross all models, we found that the mean area under the receiver operating curve for detecting AIS was 0.963{+/-}0.0520 and average precision score 0.790{+/-}0.196 with minimal feature processing. Logistic regression classifiers with L1 penalty gave the best performance. Classifiers trained with cases with AIS diagnosis codes and controls with no cerebrovascular disease diagnosis codes had the best average F1 score (0.832{+/-}0.0383). In the external validation, we found that the top probabilities from a model-predicted AIS cohort were significantly enriched for self-reported AIS patients without AIS diagnosis codes (65-250 fold over expected).\\n\\nConclusionsOur findings support machine learning algorithms as a way to accurately identify AIS patients without relying on diagnosis codes or using process-intensive manual feature curation. When a set of AIS patients is unavailable, diagnosis codes may be used to train classifier models. Our approach is potentially generalizable to other academic institutions and further external validation is needed.",

Here we describe the first tranche of large-scale exome sequence data for 49,960 study participants, revealing approximately 4 million coding variants (of which ~98.4% have frequency < 1%). The data includes 231,631 predicted loss of function variants, a >10-fold increase compared to imputed sequence for the same participants. Nearly all genes (>97%) had [&ge;]1 predicted loss of function carrier, and most genes (>69%) had [&ge;]10 loss of function carriers. We illustrate the power of characterizing loss of function variation in this large population through association analyses across 1,741 phenotypes. In addition to replicating a range of established associations, we discover novel loss of function variants with large effects on disease traits, including PIEZO1 on varicose veins, COL6A1 on corneal resistance, MEPE on bone density, and IQGAP2 and GMPR on blood cell traits. We further demonstrate the value of exome sequencing by surveying the prevalence of pathogenic variants of clinical significance in this population, finding that 2% of the population has a medically actionable variant. Additionally, we leverage the phenotypic data to characterize the relationship between rare BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic variants and cancer risk.

    "abstract": "Quantitative BOLD (qBOLD) is a technique for mapping oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and deoxygenated blood volume (DBV) in the human brain. Recent measurements using an asymmetric spin echo (ASE) based qBOLD approach produced estimates of DBV which were systematically higher than measurements from other techniques. In this study, we investigate two hypotheses for the origin of this DBV overestimation using simulations and consider the implications for experimental measurements. Investigations were performed by combining Monte Carlo simulations of extravascular signal with an analytical model of the intravascular signal.\\n\\nHypothesis 1DBV overestimation is due to the presence of intravascular signal which is not accounted for in the analysis model. Intravascular signal was found to have a weak effect on qBOLD parameter estimates.\\n\\nHypothesis 2DBV overestimation is due to the effects of diffusion which are not accounted for in the analysis model. The effect of diffusion on the extravascular signal was found to result in a vessel radius dependent variation in qBOLD parameter estimates. In particular, DBV overestimation peaks for vessels with radii from 20 to 30 m and is OEF dependent. This results in the systematic underestimation of OEF.\\n\\nImplicationsThe impact on experimental qBOLD measurements was investigated by simulating a more physiologically realistic distribution of vessel sizes with a small number of discrete radii. Overestimation of DBV consistent with previous experiments was observed, which was also found to be OEF dependent. This results in the progressive underestimation of the measured OEF. Furthermore, the relationship between the measured OEF and the true OEF was found to be dependent on echo time and spin echo displacement time.\\n\\nThe results of this study demonstrate the limitations of current ASE based qBOLD measurements and provide a foundation for the optimisation of future acquisition approaches.",

Animal versions have been adapted with nutritional rewards but interspecies data comparisons are still scarce. Our study directly compared physiological decision-making performances between humans and wild-type C57BL/6 mice. Human subjects fulfilled an electronic Iowa Gambling Task version while mice performed a maze-based adaptation with four arms baited in a probabilistic way. Our data show closely matching performances among species with similar patterns of choice behaviors. Moreover, both populations clustered into good, intermediate, and poor decision-making categories with similar proportions. Remarkably, mice good decision-makers behaved as humans of the same category, but slight differences among species have been evidenced for the other two subpopulations.

While neural activity has been shown to induce expression of a variety of genes within several hours of learning, whether this leads to persistent changes in gene expression that lasts for days or weeks remains unclear. We developed a novel mouse line which expresses Cre recombinase in an inducible manner and used it to examine gene expression in learning-activated neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) one month following contextual fear conditioning. The mPFC is not required for the initial retrieval of contextual memory but becomes necessary after one month, suggesting a slowly developing plasticity. We found a variety of changes in gene expression in learning-activated neural ensembles that were specific to the mPFC. One group of transcriptional changes observed was the coordinated upregulation of presynaptic proteins suggesting a potential learning-induced elaboration of presynaptic terminals. We tested this idea by labeling the projections of mPFC neurons active during initial learning and found an increase in the number of terminals in neurons projecting to the basolateral amygdala at 1 month following training. These results suggest a presynaptic growth mechanism that could account for the enhanced role of the mPFC in fear memory retrieval at long time points after learning.",

Intravenous administration of liposomes into mice exposed to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion took place at early (0.5h and 4h) and delayed (24h and 48h) timepoints, covering different phases of BBB disruption after stroke. Using a combination of in vivo real-time imaging and histological analysis we show that selective liposomal brain accumulation coincides with biphasic enhancement in transcellular transport followed by a delayed impairment to the paracellular barrier. This process precedes neurological damage in the acute phase and maintains long-term liposomal co-localisation within the neurovascular unit, which could have great potential for neuroprotection. Levels of liposomal uptake by glial cells are similarly selectively enhanced in the ischaemic region late after experimental stroke (2-3 days), highlighting their potential for blocking delayed inflammatory responses or shifting the polarization of microglia/macrophages towards brain repair.\\n\\nThese findings demonstrate the capability of liposomes to maximise selective translocation into the brain after stroke and identify for the first time two windows for therapeutic manipulation. This emphasizes the benefits of selective drug delivery for efficient tailoring of new stroke treatments.",

AbstractO_ST_ABSBackground.C_ST_ABSDespite their intriguing nature, investigations of the neurophysiology of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-antagonists Xenon (Xe) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are limited and have revealed inconsistent frequency-dependent alterations, in spectral power and functional connectivity. Discrepancies are likely due to using low resolution electroencephalography restricted to sensor level changes, concomitant anesthetic agent administration and dosage. Our intention was to describe the effects of equivalent stepwise levels of Xe and N2O administration on oscillatory source power using a crossover design, to explore universal mechanisms of NMDA-based anesthesia.\\n\\nMethods.22 healthy males participated in a study of simultaneous magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography recordings. In separate sessions, equivalent subanesthetic doses of gaseous anesthetic agents N2O and Xe (0.25, 0.50, 0.75 equi MAC-awake) and 1.30 MAC-awake Xe (for Loss of Responsiveness) were administered. Source power in various frequency bands was computed and statistically assessed relative to a conscious baseline.\\n\\nResults.Delta (l-4Hz) and theta (4-8Hz) band power was significantly increased at the highest Xe concentration (42%, 1.30 MAC-awake) relative to baseline for both magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography source power (p<0.005). A reduction in frontal alpha (8-13 Hz) power was observed upon N2O administration, and shown to be stronger than equivalent Xe dosage reductions (p=0.005). Higher frequency activity increases were observed in magnetoencephalographic but not encephalographic signals for N2O alone with occipital low gamma (30-49Hz) and widespread high gamma (51-99Hz) rise in source power.\\n\\nConclusions.Magnetoencephalography source imaging revealed unequivocal and widespread power changes in dissociative anesthesia, which were divergent to source electroencephalography. Loss of Responsiveness anesthesia at 42% Xe (1.30 MAC-awake) demonstrated, similar to inductive agents, low frequency power increases in frontal delta and global theta. N2O sedation yielded a rise in high frequency power in the gamma range which was primarily occipital for lower gamma bandwidth (3049 Hz) and substantially decreased alpha power, particularly in frontal regions.\\n\\nClinical trial number and Registry URLNot applicable.\\n\\nPrior PresentationsPelentritou Andria, Kuhlmann Levin; Lee Heonsoo; Cormack John; Mcguigan Steven; Woods Will; Sleigh Jamie; Lee UnCheol; Muthukumaraswamy Suresh; Liley David.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Hypoxia Altitude Simulation Test (HAST) is the Gold Standard to evaluate hypoxia in response to altitude and to decide on in-flight requirements for oxygen supplementation. Several equations are available to predict PaO2 in altitude (PaO2alt), but it remains unclear whether their predictive value is equivalent. We aimed to compare the results obtained by the available methods in a population of cystic fibrosis (CF) adults.\\n\\nMethodsEighty-eight adults (58 healthy controls and 30 CF patients) performed a spirometry followed by an HAST. HAST results were compared with the predicted PaO2alt made by five equations: 1st: PaO2alt= 0,410 x PaO2ground + 1,7652; 2nd: PaO2alt= 0,519 x PaO2ground + 11,855 x FEV1 (L) - 1,760; 3rd: PaO2alt= 0,453 x PaO2ground + 0,386 x FEV1 (%) + 2,44; 4th: PaO2alt= 0,88 + 0,68 x PaO2ground; 5th: PaO2alt= PaO2ground - 26,6.\\n\\nResultsNone of the controls required in-flight oxygen neither by HAST or by the five predictive equations. Eleven CF-patients had PaO2alt < 50 mmHg, accessed by HAST. The positive predictive value was 50% (1st), 87.5% (2nd and 3rd), 77.78% (4th) and 58.33% (5th). Areas under the curve were 78.95% (1st), 84.69% (2nd), 88.04% (3rd) and 78.95% (4th and 5th). FEV1 and PaO2ground were correlated with HAST results.\\n\\nConclusionsThe 3rd equation gave the best predictions in comparison with results obtained by HAST. However, because the individual differences found were substantial for all equations, we still recommend performing a HAST whenever possible to confidently access in-flight hypoxia and the need for oxygen.",

    "abstract": "During our daily lives, we often learn about the similarity of the traits and preferences of others to our own and use that information during our social interactions. However, it is unclear how the brain represents similarity between the self and others. One possible mechanism is to track similarity to oneself regardless of the identity of the other (Similarity account); an alternative is to track each confederate in terms of consistency of the similarity to the self, with respect to the choices they have made before (consistency account). Our study combined fMRI and computational modelling of reinforcement learning (RL) to investigate the neural processes that underlie learning about preference similarity. Participants chose which of two pieces of artwork they preferred and saw the choices of one confederate who usually shared their preference and another who usually did not. We modelled neural activation with RL models based on the similarity and consistency accounts. Data showed more brain regions whose activity pattern fits with the consistency account, specifically, areas linked to reward and social cognition. Our findings suggest that impressions of other people can be calculated in a person-specific manner which assumes that each individual behaves consistently with their past choices.",

    "abstract": "In the hindbrain and the adjacent cranial neural crest (NC) cells of jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes), nested and segmentally-restricted domains of Hox gene expression provide a combinatorial Hox-code for specifying regional properties during head development. Extant jawless vertebrates, such as the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), can provide insights into the evolution and diversification of this Hox-code in vertebrates. There is evidence for gnathostome-like spatial patterns of Hox expression in lamprey; however, the expression domains of the majority of lamprey hox genes from paralogy groups (PG) 1-4 are yet to be characterized, so it is unknown whether they are coupled to hindbrain segments (rhombomeres) and NC. In this study, we systematically describe the spatiotemporal expression of all 14 sea lamprey hox genes from PG1-PG4 in the developing hindbrain and pharynx to investigate the extent to which their expression conforms to the archetypal gnathostome hindbrain and pharyngeal hox-codes. We find many similarities in Hox expression between lamprey and gnathostome species, particularly in rhombomeric domains during hindbrain segmentation and in the cranial neural crest, enabling inference of aspects of Hox expression in the ancestral vertebrate embryonic head. These data are consistent with the idea that a Hox regulatory network underlying hindbrain segmentation is a pan vertebrate trait. We also reveal differences in hindbrain domains at later stages, as well as expression in the endostyle and in pharyngeal arch (PA) 1 mesoderm. Our analysis suggests that many Hox expression domains that are observed in extant gnathostomes were present in ancestral vertebrates but have been partitioned differently across Hox clusters in gnathostome and cyclostome lineages after duplication.",

    "abstract": "Coordinated migration of cell collectives is important during embryonic development and relies on cells integrating multiple mechanical and chemical cues. Recently, we described that focal activation of the FGF pathway promotes the migration of the parapineal in the zebrafish epithalamus. How FGF activity is restricted to leading cells in this system is, however, unclear. Here, we address the role of Notch signaling in modulating FGF activity within the parapineal. While Notch loss-of-function results in an increased number of parapineal cells activating the FGF pathway, global activation of Notch signaling decreases it; both contexts result in defects in parapineal migration and specification. Decreasing or increasing FGF signaling in a Notch loss-of-function context respectively rescues or aggravates parapineal migration defects without affecting parapineal cells specification. We propose that Notch signaling controls the migration of the parapineal through its capacity to restrict FGF pathway activation to a few leading cells.",

    "abstract": "Between October 2016 and June 2017, a C57BL/6J mouse colony that was undergoing a pre- and peri-natal methyl-donor supplementation diet intervention to study the impact of parental nutrition on offspring susceptibility to disease was found to suffer from an epizootic of unexpected deaths. Necropsy revealed the presence of severe colitis, and further investigation linked these outbreak deaths to a Clostridium difficile strain of ribotype 027 we term 16N203. C. difficile infection (CDI) is associated with antibiotic use in humans. Current murine models of CDI rely on antibiotic pretreatment to establish clinical phenotypes. In this report, the C. difficile outbreak occurs in F1 mice linked to alterations in the parental diet. The diagnosis of CDI in the affected mice was confirmed by cecal/colonic histopathology, presence of C. difficile bacteria in fecal/colonic culture, and detection of C. difficile toxins. F1 mice from parents fed the methyl-supplementation diet also had significantly reduced survival (p<0.0001) than F1 mice from parents fed the control diet. When we tested the 16N203 outbreak strain in an established mouse model of antibiotic-induced CDI, we confirmed that this strain is pathogenic. Our serendipitous observations from this spontaneous outbreak of C. difficile in association with a pre- and perinatal methyl-donor diet suggest the important role diet may play in host defense and CDI risk factors.\\n\\nImportanceClostridium difficile infection (CDI) has become the leading cause of infectious diarrhea in hospitals worldwide, owing its preeminence to the emergence of hyperendemic strains, such as ribotype 027 (RT027). A major CDI risk factor is antibiotic exposure which alters gut microbiota, resulting in the loss of colonization resistance. Current murine models of CDI also depend on pretreatment of antibiotics of animals to establish disease. The outbreak we report here is unique in that the CDI occurred in mice with no antibiotic exposure and is associated to a pre- and peri-natal methyl-supplementation donor diet intervention study. Our investigation subsequently reveals that the outbreak strain we term 16N203 is an RT027 strain, and this isolated strain is also pathogenic in an established murine model of CDI (with antibiotics). Our report of this spontaneous outbreak offers additional insight into the importance of environmental factors, such as diet, and CDI susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis, one of the oldest recorded human afflictions, is still one of the biggest killers among the infectious diseases, despite the worldwide use of a live attenuated vaccine and several antibiotics. This study was designed to assess the resistance rate distribution of MDR-TB among pulmonary tuberculosis patients attending Nnamdi Azikiewe University Teaching Hospital (NAUTH) Nnewi and St Patricks Hospital Mile 4 Abakaliki in the Southeast Nigeria. Patients with persistent cough for over two weeks were screened by Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) technique for the presence of acid fast bacilli (AFB) in their sputum and a total of 103 patients with AFB positive sputum samples were recruited. The positive sputum samples were subjected to Xpert MTB/RIF assay (GeneXpert(R), Cepheid USA) and culture on Lowestein Jensen medium for 42days at 37{degrees}C. Drug susceptibility testing was done on the isolates using the nitrate reduction assay (NRA). Xpert MTB/RIF assay detected MTB in 83(80.6%) samples out of which 45(67.2%) were rifampicin resistant. Sixty-seven (80.7%) of the isolates were resistant to at least one of the first-line drugs. Primary resistance was 91% while 19.4%, 35.8%, 22.4% and 22.4% of the isolates were resistant to one, two, three and four drugs respectively. Isoniazid had the highest rate of resistance (57.8%) while Ethambutol had the least (34.9%) and 30(44.8%) of the resistant isolates were MDR. Smoking (P=.002), gender (P=.002) and history of TB treatment (P=.012) were significantly associated with drug resistance. Educational status was significantly associated with MDR-TB (P=.020). NAUTH and St Patricks hospital had MDR-TB rates of 38.9% and 46.9% respectively. The findings of this study indicate high prevalence of MDR-TB among patients with pulmonary TB in the study sites and this portrays a menace to adequate TB control. Prompt diagnosis of TB, adequate patient compliance to therapy and increased awareness and mass education is recommended",

Various studies have reported altered structural brain asymmetry in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, findings have been inconsistent, likely due to limited sample sizes and low statistical power.\\n\\nMethodsWe investigated 1,774 subjects with ASD and 1,809 controls, from 54 datasets, for differences in the asymmetry of thickness and surface area of 34 cerebral cortical regions. We also examined global hemispheric measures of cortical thickness and area asymmetry, and volumetric asymmetries of subcortical structures. Data were obtained via the ASD Working Group of the ENIGMA (Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis) consortium. T1-weighted MRI data were processed with a single protocol using FreeSurfer and the Desikan-Killiany atlas.\\n\\nResultsASD was significantly associated with reduced leftward asymmetry of total hemispheric average cortical thickness, compared to controls. Eight regional thickness asymmetries, distributed over the cortex, also showed significant associations with diagnosis after correction for multiple comparisons, for which asymmetry was again generally lower in ASD versus controls. In addition, the medial orbitofrontal surface area was less rightward asymmetric in ASD than controls, and the putamen volume was more leftward asymmetric in ASD than controls. The largest effect size had Cohens d = 0.15. Most effects did not depend on age, sex, IQ, or disorder severity.\\n\\nConclusionAltered lateralized neurodevelopment is suggested in ASD, affecting widespread cortical regions with diverse functions. Large-scale analysis was necessary to reliably detect, and accurately describe, subtle alterations of structural brain asymmetry in this disorder.",

    "abstract": "The reticulospinal tract plays an important role in primate upper limb function, but methods for assessing its activity are limited. One promising approach is to measure rapid visual responses (RVRs) in arm muscle activity during a visually-cued reaching task; these may arise from a tecto-reticulospinal pathway. We investigated whether changes in reticulospinal excitability can be assessed non-invasively using RVRs, by pairing the visual stimuli of the reaching task with electrical stimulation of the median nerve, galvanic vestibular stimulation or loud sounds, all of which are known to activate the reticular formation.\\n\\nSurface electromyogram recordings were made from the right deltoid of healthy human subjects as they performed fast reaching movements towards visual targets. Stimuli were delivered up to 200ms before target appearance and RVR was quantified as the EMG amplitude in a window 75-125ms after visual target onset. Median nerve, vestibular and auditory stimuli all consistently facilitated the RVRs, as well as reducing the latency of responses. We propose that this reflects modulation of tecto-reticulospinal excitability, suggesting that the amplitude of RVRs can be used to assess changes in brainstem excitability non-invasively in humans.\\n\\nNew & NoteworthyShort latency responses in arm muscles evoked during a visually-driven reaching task have previously been proposed to be tecto-reticulospinal in origin. We demonstrate that these responses can be facilitated by pairing the appearance of a visual target with stimuli that activate the reticular formation - median nerve, vestibular and auditory stimuli.

While in exon 8, g.18783-18784AG>TT, g.18803A>C, g.18860A>C, g.18845A>T and g.18863_ 18864 InsT were observed.\\n\\nConclusionwe found a significant association between the overexpression of TP53 protein and mutation in exon 4 and 8. A silent mutation P301P was detected in all of examined cases. Two patients who diagnosed with small cell sarcoma have shared the same mutations in exon8. Further studies with large sample size are required to demonstrate the usefulness of these mutations in the screening of EC especially SCCE.",

    "abstract": "Small fluorescent molecules are widely used as probes of biomembranes. Different probes optically indicate membrane properties such as the lipid phase, thickness, viscosity, and electrical potential. The detailed molecular mechanisms behind probe signals are not well understood, in part due to the lack of tools to determine probe position and orientation in the membrane. Optical measurements on aligned biomembranes and lipid bilayers provide some degree of orientational information based on anisotropy in absorption, fluorescence, or nonlinear optical properties. These methods typically find the polar tilt angle between the membrane normal and the long axis of the molecule. Here we show that solution-phase surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectra of lipid membranes on gold nanorods can be used to determine molecular orientation of molecules within the membrane. The voltage sensitive dye 4-(2-(6-(dibutylamino)-2-naphthalenyl)ethenyl)-1-(3-sulfopropyl)-hydroxide, known as di-4-ANEPPS, is studied. Through the analysis of several peaks in the SERS spectrum, the polar angle from the membrane normal is found to be 63{degrees}, and the roll angle around the long axis of the molecule to be 305{degrees} from the original orientation. This structural analysis method could help elucidate the meaning of fluorescent membrane probe signals, and how they are affected by different lipid compositions.",

    "abstract": "Neuroblastoma is a malignancy of the developing sympathetic nervous system that accounts for 12% of childhood cancer deaths. Like many childhood cancers, neuroblastoma exhibits a relative paucity of somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions and deletions (indels) compared to adult cancers. Here, we assessed the contribution of somatic structural variation (SV) in neuroblastoma using a combination of whole genome sequencing (WGS; n=135) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping (n=914) of matched tumor-normal pairs. Our study design allowed for orthogonal validation and replication across platforms. SV frequency, type, and localization varied significantly among high-risk tumors. MYCN non-amplified high-risk tumors harbored an increased SV burden overall, including a substantial excess of tandem-duplication events across the genome. Genes disrupted by SV breakpoints were enriched in neuronal lineages and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The postsynaptic adapter protein-coding gene SHANK2, located on chromosome 11q13, was disrupted by SVs in 14% of MYCN non-amplified high-risk tumors based on WGS and 10% in the SNP array cohort. Expression of SHANK2 was low across human-derived neuroblastoma cell lines and high-risk neuroblastoma tumors. Forced expression of SHANK2 in neuroblastoma cell models resulted in significant growth inhibition (P=2.62x10-2 to 3.4x10-5) and accelerated neuronal differentiation following treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (P=3.08x10-13 to 2.38x10-30). These data further define the complex landscape of structural variation in neuroblastoma and suggest that events leading to deregulation of neurodevelopmental processes, such as inactivation of SHANK2, are key mediators of tumorigenesis in this childhood cancer.",

We used MCF10A cell lines as a model system in which to investigate the effect of induced oncogene expression on mitotic entry. We find that activation of oncogenic RasV12, for as little as five hours, changes the way cells divide. RasV12-dependent activation of the MEK-ERK signalling cascade alters acto-myosin contractility to enhance mitotic rounding. RasV12 also affects cell mechanics, so that RasV12 expressing cells are softer in interphase but stiffen more upon entry into mitosis. As a consequence, RasV12 expression augments the ability of cells to round up and divide faithfully when confined underneath a stiff hydrogel. Conversely, inhibition of the Ras-ERK pathway reduces mitotic rounding under confinement, resulting in chromosome segregation defects. These data suggest a novel mechanism by which oncogenic Ras-ERK signalling can aid division in stiff environments like those found in tumours.",

    "abstract": "Unfolded protein response is a dynamic signalling pathway, which is involved in the maintenance of proteostasis and cellular homeostasis. IRE1, a transmembrane signalling protein represents the start point of a highly conserved UPR signalling cascade. IRE1 is endowed with kinase and endoribonuclease activities. The activation of the kinase domain of IRE1 by trans-autophosphorylation leads to the activation of its RNAse domain. RNAse domain performs atypical splicing of Xbp1 mRNA and degradation of mRNAs by an effector function known as Regulated IRE1 Dependent Decay (RIDD). The regulation of the distinctive nature of the IRE1 ribonuclease function is potentially mediated by a dynamic protein structure UPRosome that is an assembly of a huge number of proteins on IRE1. Here, we reported that Bid is a novel recruit to UPRosome, which directly interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of IRE1. Bid controls the auto-phosphorylation of IRE1 in a negative manner where Bid overexpression conditions displayed reduced phosphorylation levels of IRE1 and Bid knockdown cells showed slightly enhanced IRE1 phosphorylation. This effect was reciprocated with JNK, a downstream target of IRE1. Our Insilico analysis revealed that Bid binding to IRE1 dimer averts its structural flexibility and thereby preventing its trans-autophosphorylation activity. We found that the effect of Bid is specific to the IRE1 branch of UPR signalling and competitive in nature. The highlighting observation of the study was that Bid stimulated a differential activity of the IRE1 RNAse domain towards Xbp1 splicing and RIDD. These results together establish that Bid is a part of the UPRosome and modulates IRE1 in a way to differentially regulate its RNAse outputs.",

    "abstract": "Whole genome duplications (WGDs) are found in a variety of tumors and are associated with chromosomal instability (CIN) and poor prognosis [1,2]. When induced experimentally, through cytokinesis failure, polyploid cells generate tumors [3]. Cytokinesis failure results in the accumulation of double DNA content, but also of cytoplasmic organelles, such as centrosomes, which are the major microtubule (MT) organizing centers of animal cells. Importantly, even if there is a correlation between polyploidy and CIN [4], the underlying mechanisms generating error-prone mitosis in cells with extra DNA and extra centrosomes are not known. When considering polyploid mitosis, it is essential to take into account the increase in MT nucleation due to the presence of extra centrosomes and extra DNA. The presence of supernumerary centrosomes in a cell, centrosome amplification [5], is associated with mitotic spindle multipolarity and CIN [6-9]. Importantly, additional MTs can be nucleated from the chromatin (chromatin mediated pathway-CMP) or from pre-existing MTs-through the Augmin pathway. We hypothesized that the increase in DNA and centrosome content in a cell could lead to an increased MT mass, which might account for abnormal mitosis described in polyploid cells [4, 10, 11, 12]. Using genetics, live imaging and modeling approaches, we investigated the mechanisms establishing multipolarity in vivo in polyploid cells. We found that MT nucleation from the centrosomes is the major contributor to multipolarity, while other pathways seem to play minor roles. Unexpectedly, we found that even if Ncd/HSET, plays an essential role in promoting centrosome clustering in early mitosis, the increase in chromosome mass associated with cytokinesis failure functions as a barrier to centrosome clustering into two main poles. Our work provides a mechanistic link between polyploidy and the generation of CIN.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWWith current environmental changes, evolution can rescue declining populations, but what happens to their interacting species? Mutualistic interactions can help species sustain each other when their environment worsens. However, mutualism is often costly to maintain, and evolution might counter-select it when not profitable enough. We investigate how evolution of mutualism affects the coexistence of two mutualistic species, e.g. a plant-pollinator or plant-fungi system. Specifically, using eco-evolutionary dynamics, we study the evolution of the focal species investment in the mutualistic interaction of a focal species (e.g. plant attractiveness via flower or nectar production for pollinators or carbon exudate for mycorrhizal fungi), and how it is affected by the decline of the partner population with which it is interacting. We assume an allocation trade-off so that investment in the mutualistic interaction reduces the species intrinsic growth rate. First, we investigate how evolution changes species persistence, biomass production, and the intensity of the mutualistic interaction. We show that concave trade-offs allow evolutionary convergence to stable coexistence. We next assume an external disturbance that decreases the partner population by lowering its intrinsic growth rate. Such declines result in the evolution of lower investment of the focal species in the mutualistic interaction, which eventually leads to the extinction of the partner species. With asymmetric mutualism favouring the partner, the evolutionary disappearance of the mutualistic interaction is delayed. Our results suggest that evolution may account for the current collapse of some mutualistic system like plant-pollinator ones, and that restoration attempts should be enforced early enough to prevent potential negative effects driven by evolution.",

Evaluation of vaccine properties was indicated that our construct is stable and immunogenic enough to induce relevant responses besides not being allergic. After predicting the tertiary structure and energy minimization, protein-protein docking was performed to calculate the free energy of possible interactions between the vaccine and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to assure that simultaneous complementary responses would be activated by our construct.

    "abstract": "Both genome-wide association study and next generation sequencing data analyses are widely employed in order to identify disease susceptible common and/or rare genetic variants in many large scale genetic studies. Rare variants generally have large effects though they are hard to detect due to their low frequency. Currently, many existing statistical methods for rare variants association studies employ a weighted combination scheme, which usually puts subjective weights or suboptimal weights based on some ad hoc assumptions (e.g. ignoring dependence between rare variants). In this study, we analytically derive optimal weights for both common and rare variants and propose a General and novel approach to Test association between an Optimally Weighted combination of variants (G-TOW) in a gene or pathway for a continuous or dichotomous trait while easily adjusting for covariates. We conduct extensive simulation studies to evaluate the performance of G-TOW. Results of the simulation studies show that G-TOW has properly controlled type I error rates and it is the most powerful test among the methods we compared, when testing effects of either both rare and common variants or rare variants only. We also illustrate the effectiveness of G-TOW using the Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 (GAW17) data. In addition, we applied G-TOW and other competitive methods to test association for schizophrenia. The G-TOW have successfully verified genes FYN and VPS39 which are associated with schizophrenia reported in existing publications. Both of these genes are missed by the weighted sum statistic (WSS) and the sequence kernel association test (SKAT). G-TOW also showed much stronger significance (p-value=0.0037) than our previously developed method named Testing the effect of an Optimally Weighted combination of variants (TOW) (p-value=0.0143) on gene FYN. FYN is a member of the protein-tyrosine kinase oncogene family that phosphorylates glutamate metabotropic receptors and ionotropic N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. NMDA modulates trafficking, subcellular distribution and function. It is involved in neuronal apoptosis, brain development and synaptic transmission and lower expression, which has been observed in the platelets of schizophrenic patients compared with controls. The application for schizophrenia indicates that G-TOW is a powerful tool in genome-wide association studies.",

We showed by the amino acid substitutions that the glutamine residues are completely dispensable for 9aaTADs function. We described the 9aaTAD domains origin and evolutionary history. The ancestral Sp2 gene with inactive 9aaTAD has duplicated in early chordates and created new paralogs Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4. We discovered that the accumulation of valines in the 9aaTADs correlated with the domain inactivation. The Sp2 activation domain, whose dormancy have lasted over 100 million years during chordate evolution, enabled later diversification in the Sp1-4 clade, including both repressors and activators. The new paralogs Sp1 and Sp3 activation domains have regained their original activator function by loss of valines in their 9aaTADs.",

Yet, whether mammals can make use of the ensuing temporal structure (Celani et al., 2014; Crimaldi and Koseff, 2001; Murlis et al., 1992; Mylne and Mason, 1991; Schmuker et al., 2016; Vickers, 2000) to extract information about the olfactory environment remains unknown. Here, we use dual-energy photoionisation recording with >300 Hz bandwidth to simultaneously determine odour concentrations of two odours in air. We show that temporal correlation of odour concentrations reliably predicts whether odorants emerge from the same or different sources in normal turbulent environments outside and in laboratory conditions. To replicate natural odour dynamics in a reproducible manner we developed a multichannel odour delivery device allowing presentation of several odours with 10 ms temporal resolution. Integrating this device in an automated operant conditioning system we demonstrate that mice can reliably discriminate the correlation structure of odours at frequencies of up to 40 Hz. Consistent with this finding, output neurons in the olfactory bulb show segregated responses depending on the correlation of odour stimuli with populations of 10s of neurons sufficient to reach behavioural performance. Our work thus demonstrates that mammals can perceive temporal structure in odour stimuli at surprisingly fast timescales. This in turn might be useful for key behavioural challenges (Jacobs, 2012) such as odour source separation (Hopfield, 1991), figure-ground separation (Rokni et al., 2014) or odour localisation (Vergassola et al., 2007; Vickers, 2000).",

    "abstract": "Treating cancer in precision medicine, it is important to identify the personalized combinational drugs under consideration of the individual heterogeneity. Many bioinformatics tools for the personalized driver genes identification have presented promising clues in determining candidate personalized drug targets for the personalized drugs discovery. However, it has not been studied how to fill the gap between personalized driver genes identification and personalized combinational drugs discovery. In this work, we developed a novel algorithm of structure network Controllability-based Personalized driver Genes and combinational Drug identification (CPGD), aiming to mine the personalized driver genes and identify the combinational drugs of an individual cancer patient. On two benchmark cancer datasets, the performance of CPGD for predicting the clinical efficacious combinational drugs is superior to that of other state-of-the-art driver gene-focus algorithms in terms of precision accuracy. In particular, by quantifying and referring the relationships between target genes of pairwise combinatorial drugs and disease module genes on breast cancer data set, CPGD can significantly divide patients into the discriminative high-risk and low-risk groups for risk asessment in combination therapy. In addition, CPGD can further enhance cancer subtyping by providing computationally personalized side effect signatures for individual patients. Collectively, CPGD provided a new and effecient bioinformatics tool from structure network controllability perspective for discovering personalized combinational drugs with personalized side effect consideration, so as to effectively support personalized risk assessement and disease subtyping.\n\nSignificanceIt is quite challenging to predict personalized combinational drugs rather than patient-cohort s drugs based on cancer omics data. In this work, a novel structure network Controllability-based algorithm (CPGD) from feedback vertex sets control perspective was developed, for discovering efficacious combinational drugs of an individual cancer patient by targeting the personalized driver genes. The CPGD contains three methodological advances by exploring more precise mathematical models on high-throughput personalized multi-omics data. The first is that a proper network structure is constructed to characterize the gene regulatory mechanism of an individual patient. The second is that considering the weight information of network edges/relations improves the performance for predicting clinical efficacious combinational drugs compared with other drivers-focus methods. And the third is that proper evaluation metrics for personalized combinational drugs prioritization, personalized risk assessment and disease subtyping are designed when evaluating the performance of CPGD.",

    "abstract": "Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a leading technology for determining protein structures. Recent advances in this field have allowed for atomic resolution. However, predicting the backbone trace of a protein has remained a challenge on all but the most pristine density maps (< 2.5[A] resolution). Here we introduce a deep learning model that uses a set of cascaded convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict C atoms along a proteins backbone structure. The cascaded-CNN (C-CNN) is a novel deep learning architecture comprised of multiple CNNs, each predicting a specific aspect of a proteins structure. This model predicts secondary structure elements (SSEs), backbone structure, and C atoms, combining the results of each to produce a complete prediction map. The cascaded-CNN is a semantic segmentation image classifier and was trained using thousands of simulated density maps. This method is largely automatic and only requires a recommended threshold value for each evaluated protein. A specialized tabu-search path walking algorithm was used to produce an initial backbone trace with C placements. A helix-refinement algorithm made further improvements to the -helix SSEs of the backbone trace. Finally, a novel quality assessment-based combinatorial algorithm was used to effectively map C traces to obtain full-atom protein structures. This method was tested on 50 experimental maps between 2.6[A] and 4.4[A] resolution. It outperformed several state-of-the-art prediction methods including RosettaES, MAINMAST, and a Phenix based method by producing the most complete prediction models, as measured by percentage of found C atoms. This method accurately predicted 88.5% (mean) of the C atoms within 3[A] of a proteins backbone structure surpassing the 66.8% mark achieved by the leading alternate method (Phenix based fully automatic method) on the same set of density maps. The C-CNN also achieved an average RMSD of 1.23[A] for all 50 experimental density maps which is similar to the Phenix based fully automatic method.

    "abstract": "Top predators responses to environmental conditions shape food web architecture and influence ecosystem structure and stability. Yet the impacts of fundamental properties like ecosystem size and morphometry on top predators behaviour are poorly understood. We examined how lake morphometry impacts the behaviour (inferred by depth use) of three key fish top predators--the cold-adapted lake trout, the cool-adapted walleye, and the warm-adapted smallmouth bass-- which can each strongly impact local food web structure. We used catch-per-unit-effort data from nearly 500 boreal lakes of Ontario, Canada to evaluate the role of thermal preference in dictating mean depth of capture and biomass index in response to lake morphometry. We found evidence that thermal preferences influence how species depth use and biomass changed with lake size, proportion of littoral area, and maximum lake depth, although we found no relationship with lake shape. However, found no strong evidence that lake morphology influences these species biomasses, despite theory that predicts such a relationship. Our results suggest that some aspects of lake morphometry can alter habitat accessibility and productivity in ways that influence the behaviour and biomass of these top predator species depending on their thermal preferences. Our results have implications for how lake food webs expand and contract with lake morphometry and other key abiotic factors. We argue that several key abiotic factors likely drive top predator depth use in ways that may shape local food web structure and play an important role in determining the ultimate fate of ecosystems with environmental change.",

    "abstract": "Malaria pathogenesis results from the asexual replication of Plasmodium falciparum within human red blood cells, which relies on a precisely timed cascade of gene expression over a 48-hour life cycle. Although substantial post-transcriptional regulation of this hardwired program has been observed, it remains unclear how these processes are mediated on a transcriptome-wide level. To this end, we identified mRNA modifications in the P. falciparum transcriptome and performed a comprehensive characterization of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) over the course of blood stage development. Using mass spectrometry and m6A RNA sequencing, we demonstrate that m6A is highly developmentally regulated, exceeding m6A levels known in any other eukaryote. We identify an evolutionarily conserved m6A writer complex and show that knockdown of the putative m6A methyltransferase by CRISPR interference leads to increased levels of transcripts that normally contain m6A. In accordance, we find an inverse correlation between m6A status and mRNA stability or translational efficiency. Our data reveal the crucial role of extensive m6A mRNA methylation in dynamically fine-tuning the transcriptional program of a unicellular eukaryote as well as a new  epitranscriptomic layer of gene regulation in malaria parasites.",

    "abstract": "Retinotopic organization is a fundamental feature of visual cortex thought to play a vital role in encoding spatial information. One important aspect of normal retinotopy is the representation of the right and left hemifields in contralateral visual cortex. However, in human albinism, many temporal retinal afferents decussate pathologically at the optic chiasm resulting in partially superimposed representations of opposite hemifields in each hemisphere of visual cortex. Previous fMRI studies in human albinism suggest that the right and left hemifield representations are superimposed in a mirror-symmetric manner. This should produce imaging voxels which respond to two separate regions in visual space mirrored across the vertical meridian. However, it is not yet clear how retino-cortical miswiring in albinism manifests at the level of single voxel population receptive fields. Here we used fMRI retinotopic mapping in conjunction with population receptive field (pRF) modeling to fit both single and dual pRF models to the visual responses of voxels in visual areas V1-V3 of five subjects with albinism. We found that subjects with albinism (but not controls) have sizable clusters of voxels with dual pRFs consistently corresponding to, but not fully coextensive with regions of hemifield overlap. These dual pRFs were typically positioned at roughly mirror image locations across the vertical meridian but were uniquely clustered within the visual field for each subject. We also found that single pRFs are larger in albinism than controls, and that single pRF sizes in the central visual field were anti-correlated with subjects foveal cone densities. Finally, dual pRF and aberrant hemifield representation characteristics varied significantly across subjects with albinism suggesting more central heterogeneity than previously appreciated.",

It has shown to be predictive of overall survival and is composed of two key metrics: qualitative assessment of lymph nodes and the percentage of invasive or in-situ tumour cellularity (TC) in the tumour bed (TB). Currently, TC is assessed through eye-balling of routine histopathology slides estimating the proportion of tumour cells within the TB.

    "abstract": "The development of vision during the first months of life is an active process that comprises the learning of appropriate neural representations and the learning of accurate eye movements. While it has long been suspected that the two learning processes are coupled, there is still no widely accepted theoretical framework describing this joint development. Here we propose a computational model of the development of active binocular vision to fill this gap. The model is based on a new formulation of the Active Efficient Coding theory, which proposes that eye movements, as well as stimulus encoding, are jointly adapted to maximize the overall coding efficiency. Under healthy conditions, the model self-calibrates to perform accurate vergence and accommodation eye movements. It exploits disparity cues to deduce the direction of defocus, which leads to co-ordinated vergence and accommodation responses. In a simulated anisometropic case, where the refraction power of the two eyes differs, an amblyopia-like state develops, in which the foveal region of one eye is suppressed due to inputs from the other eye. After correcting for refractive errors, the model can only reach healthy performance levels if receptive fields are still plastic, in line with findings on a critical period for binocular vision development. Overall, our model offers a unifying conceptual framework for understanding the development of binocular vision.\n\nSignificance StatementBrains must operate in an energy-efficient manner. The efficient coding hypothesis states that sensory systems achieve this by adapting neural representations to the statistics of sensory input signals. Importantly, however, these statistics are shaped by the organisms behavior and how it samples information from the environment. Therefore, optimal performance requires jointly optimizing neural representations and behavior, a theory called Active Efficient Coding. Here we test the plausibility of this theory by proposing a computational model of the development of binocular vision. The model explains the development of accurate binocular vision under healthy conditions. In the case of refractive errors, however, the model develops an amblyopia-like state and suggests conditions for successful treatment.",

    "abstract": "The Lesser Sundas Archipelago is comprised of two parallel chains of islands that extend between the Asian continental shelf (Sundaland) and Australo-Papuan continental shelf (Sahul). These islands have served as stepping-stones for taxa dispersing between the Asian and Australo-Papuan biogeographic realms. While the oceanic barriers have prevented many species from colonizing the archipelago, a number of terrestrial vertebrate species have colonized the islands either by rafting/swimming or human introduction. Here we examine phylogeographic structure within the Lesser Sundas for three snake, two lizard, and two frog species that each have a Sunda Shelf origin. These species are suspected to have recently colonized the archipelago, though all have inhabited the Lesser Sundas for over 100 years. We sequenced mtDNA from 230 samples to test whether there is sufficiently deep genetic structure within any of these taxa to reject human-mediated introduction. Additionally, we tested for genetic signatures of population expansion consistent with recent introduction, and estimated the ages of Lesser Sundas clades, if any exist. Our results show little to no genetic structure between populations on different islands in five species, and moderate structure in two species. Nucleotide diversity is low for all species, and the ages of the most recent common ancestor for species with monophyletic Lesser Sundas lineages date to the Holocene or late Pleistocene. These results support the hypothesis that these species entered the archipelago relatively recently and either naturally colonized or were introduced by humans to most of the islands within the archipelago within a short time span.",

    "abstract": "Although methods for tracking animals underwater exist, they frequently involve costly infrastructure investment, or capture and manipulation of animals to affix or implant tags. These practical concerns limit the taxonomic coverage of aquatic movement ecology studies and implementation in areas where high infrastructure investment is impossible. Here we present a method based on deep-learning and structure-from-motion, with which we can accurately determine the 3D location of animals, the structure of the environment in which they are moving. Further behavioural decomposition of the body position and contour of animals subsequently allow quantifying the behavioural states of each interacting animal. This approach can be used with minimal infrastructure and without confining animals to to a fixed area, or capturing and interfering with them in any way. With this approach, we are able to track single individuals (Conger Eel, Conger oceanus), small heterospecific groups (Mullus surmuletus, Diplodus sp.), and schools of animals (Tanganyikan cichlids Lamprologus callipterus) in freshwater and marine systems, and in habitats ranging in environmental complexity. Positional information was highly accurate, with errors as low as 1.67% of body length. Tracking data was embedded in 3D environmental models that could be used to examine collective decision making, obstacle avoidance, and visual connectivity of groups. By analyzing body contour and position, we were also able to use unsupervised classification to quantify the kinematic behavioural states of each animal. The proposed framework allows us to understand animal behaviour in aquatic systems at an unprecedented resolution and a fraction of the cost of established methodologies, with minimal domain expertise at the data acquisition or analysis phase required. Implementing this method, research can be conducted in a wide range of field contexts to collect laboratory standard data, vastly expanding both the taxonomic and environmental coverage of quantitative animal movement analysis with a low-cost, open-source solution.",

One such testing procedure, called the  optimal discovery procedure (ODP), leverages information across different tests to provide an optimal ranking of genes. This approach can lead to substantial improvements in statistical power compared to other methods. However, current applications of the ODP have only been established for simple study designs using microarray technology. Here we extend this work to the analysis of complex study designs and RNA sequencing studies. We then apply our extended framework to a static RNA sequencing study, a longitudinal and an independent sampling time-series study, and an independent sampling dose-response study. We find that our method shows improved performance compared to other testing procedures, finding more differentially expressed genes and increasing power for enrichment analysis. Thus the extended ODP enables a superior significance analysis of genomic studies. The algorithm is implemented in our freely available R package called edge.",

    "abstract": "Fillet yield (FY) and harvest weight (HW) are economically important traits in Nile tilapia production. Genetic improvement of these traits, especially for FY, are lacking, due to the absence of efficient methods to measure the traits without sacrificing fish and the use of information from relatives to selection. However, genomic information could be used by genomic selection to improve traits that are difficult to measure directly in selection candidates, as in the case of FY. The objectives of this study were: (i) to perform genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to dissect the genetic architecture of FY and HW, (ii) to evaluate the accuracy of genotype imputation and (iii) to assess the accuracy of genomic selection using true and imputed low-density (LD) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panels to determine a cost-effective strategy for practical implementation of genomic information in tilapia breeding programs. The data set consisted of 5,866 phenotyped animals and 1,238 genotyped animals (108 parents and 1,130 offspring) using a 50K SNP panel. The GWAS were performed using all genotyped and phenotyped animals. The genotyped imputation was performed from LD panels (LD0.5K, LD1K and LD3K) to high-density panel (HD), using information from parents and 20% of offspring in the reference set and the remaining 80% in the validation set. In addition, we tested the accuracy of genomic selection using true and imputed genotypes comparing the accuracy obtained from pedigree-based best linear unbiased prediction (PBLUP) and genomic predictions. The results from GWAS supports evidence of the polygenic nature of FY and HW. The accuracy of imputation ranged from 0.90 to 0.98 for LD0.5K and LD3K, respectively. The accuracy of genomic prediction outperformed the estimated breeding value from PBLUP. The use of imputation for genomic selection resulted in an increased relative accuracy independent of the trait and LD panel analyzed. The present results suggest that genotype imputation could be a cost-effective strategy for genomic selection in tilapia breeding programs.",

However, predictably harnessing the microbiota for beneficial outcomes is currently limited by our lack of understanding of the physiology of the constituent bacteria. For instance, the functions of most of their genes are not known. Here, we systematically measure mutant phenotypes for genes from the gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. Using a barcoded transposon mutant library, we measured the fitness of 4,055 B. thetaiotaomicron genes across 492 experiments, including growth on 45 carbon substrates and in the presence of 57 stress-inducing compounds. Our data is in strong agreement with previous studies, and more importantly also uncovers the biological roles of poorly annotated genes. We identified 497 genes with a specific phenotype in only one or a handful of conditions, thus enabling informed predictions of gene function for a subset of these genes. For example, we identified a glycoside hydrolase important for growth on type I rhamnogalacturonan, a DUF4861 protein for glycosaminoglycan utilization, a DUF1080 protein for disaccharide utilization, and a tripartite multidrug resistance system specifically important for bile salt tolerance.

    "abstract": "The bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) is a forebrain region highly sensitive to stress that expresses corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neuropeptide at high levels and regulates negative valence behaviors associated with anxiety. However, how chronic stress modulates CRH signaling and neuronal activity in BNST remains unknown. We subjected C57BL6/J mice to a 6-week chronic variable mild stress (CVMS) paradigm and investigated the effects on behavior, BNST cellular neurophysiology, and BNST CRH signaling. We also utilized pharmacological infusions and optogenetics to decipher and mimic the effects of CVMS on BNST cellular neurophysiology and behavior. CVMS elevated plasma corticosterone levels, induced negative valence behaviors associated with anxiety, diminished M-currents (voltage-gated K+ currents that stabilize membrane potential and regulate neuronal excitability), and increased mEPSC amplitude in ovBNST. Additionally, the number of c-fos+, CRH+, and CRH activator pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP)+ cells were increased while CRH inhibitor striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP)+ cells were decreased in ovBNST. These expression data were confirmed with qPCR. CVMS also activated PKA in BNST and the electrophysiological and behavioral effects of CVMS were reversed by ovBNST infusion of the PKA-selective antagonist H89. Moreover, optogenetic activation of ovBNST directly induced negative valence behaviors associated with anxiety, mimicking the effects of CVMS. CVMS mediates effects on negative valence behaviors associated with anxiety by activating CRH signaling components and cellular excitability in ovBNST Our findings decipher an important CRH-associated stress molecular signature in BNST and advance our understanding of the neural circuitry underlying stress-induced disorders.",

We used linear multi-contact array recordings to analyze the spatial and temporal properties of population activity along the SC dorsoventral axis during delayed saccade tasks. During the visual epoch, information appeared first in dorsal layers and systematically later in ventral layers. In the ensuing delay period, the laminar organization of low-spiking rate activity matched that of the visual epoch. During the pre-saccadic epoch, spiking activity emerged first in a more ventral layer, [~]100ms before saccade onset. This buildup of activity appeared later on nearby neurons situated both dorsally and ventrally, culminating in a synchronous burst across the dorsoventral axis, [~]28ms before saccade onset. Stimulation of individual contacts on the laminar probe produced saccades of similar vectors. Collectively, the results reveal a principled spatiotemporal organization of SC population activity underlying sensorimotor transformation for the control of gaze.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn cardiac ventricular muscle cells, the presence of voltage-gated sodium channels Nav1.5 at the lateral membrane depends in part on the interaction between the dystrophin-syntrophin complex and the Nav1.5 C-terminal PDZ-domain-binding sequence Ser-Ile-Val (SIV motif). 1-Syntrophin, a PDZ-domain adaptor protein, mediates the interaction between Nav1.5 and dystrophin at the lateral membrane of cardiac cells. Using the cell-attached patch-clamp approach on cardiomyocytes expressing Nav1.5 in which the SIV motif is deleted ({Delta}SIV), sodium current (INa) recordings from the lateral membrane revealed an SIV-motif-independent INa. Since immunostainings have suggested that Nav1.5 is expressed in transverse (T-) tubules, this remaining INa might be conducted by channels in the T-tubules. Of note, a recent study using heterologous expression systems showed that 1-syntrophin also interacts with the Nav1.5 N-terminus, which may explain the SIV-motif independent INa at the lateral membrane of cardiomyocytes.\\n\\nAimTo address the role of 1-syntrophin in regulating the INa at the lateral membrane of cardiac cells.\\n\\nMethods and resultsPatch-clamp experiments in cell-attached configuration were performed on the lateral membranes of wild-type, 1-syntrophin knock-down, and {Delta}SIV ventricular mouse cardiomyocytes. Compared to wild-type, a reduction of the lateral INa was observed in myocytes from 1-syntrophin knockdown hearts. However, similar to {Delta}SIV myocytes, a remaining INa was still recorded. In addition, cell-attached INa recordings from lateral membrane did not differ significantly between non-detubulated and detubulated {Delta}SIV cardiomyocytes. Lastly, we obtained evidence suggesting that cell-attached patch-clamp experiments on the lateral membrane cannot record currents conducted by channels in T-tubules such as calcium channels.\\n\\nConclusionAltogether, these results suggest the presence of a sub-pool of sodium channels at the lateral membrane of cardiomyocytes that is independent of 1-syntrophin and the PDZ-binding motif of Na 1.5, located in membrane domains outside of T-tubules. The question of a T-tubular pool of Nav1.5 channels however remains open.",

    "abstract": "Molluscan bivalves rapidly repair the damaged shells to prevent further injury. However, it remains unclear how this process is precisely controlled. In this study, we applied scanning electronic microscopy, transmission electronic microscopy and histochemical analysis to examine the detailed shell regeneration process of the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata. It was found that the shell damage caused the mantle tissue to retract, which resulted in dislocation of the mantle zones to their correspondingly secreted shell layers. However, the secretory repertoires of the different mantle zones remained unchanged. As a result, the dislocation of the mantle tissue dramatically affected the shell morphology, and the unusual presence of the submarginal zone on the nacreous layers caused de novo precipitation of prismatic layers on the nacreous layers. Real-time PCR revealed that the expression of the shell matrix proteins (SMPs) were significantly upregulated, which was confirmed by the thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) of the newly formed shell. The increased matrix secretion accelerated CaCO3 nucleation thus promoting shell deposition. Taken together, our study revealed the close relationship between the physiological activities of the mantle tissue and the morphological change of the regenerated shells.",

    "abstract": "In precision oncology, genomic evidence is used to determine the optimal treatment for each patient. However, identification of somatic mutations from genome sequencing data is often technically difficult and functional significance of somatic mutations is inconclusive in many cases. In this paper, to seek for an alternative approach, we tackle the problem of predicting functional mutations from transcriptome sequencing data. Focusing on SF3B1, a key splicing factor gene, we develop SF3B1ness score for classifying functional mutation status using a combination of Naive Bayes classifier and zero-inflated beta-binomial modeling (R package is available at (https://github.com/friend1WS/SF3B1ness). Using 8,992 TCGA exome and RNA sequencing data for evaluation, we show that the classifier based on SF3B1ness score is able to (1) attain very high precision (>93%) and sensitivity (>95%), (2) rescue several somatic mutations not identified by exome sequence analysis especially due to low variant allele frequencies, and (3) successfully measure functional importance for somatic mutation whose significance has been unknown. Furthermore, to demonstrate that the SF3B1ness score is highly robust and can be extensible to the cohorts outside training data, we performed a functional SF3B1 mutation screening on 51,577 additional transcriptome sequencing data. We have detected 135 samples with putative SF3B1 functional mutations including those that are rarely registered in the somatic mutation database (e.g., G664C, L747W, and R775G). Moreover, we could identify two cases with SF3B1 mutations from normal tissues, implying that SF3B1ness score can be used for detecting clonal hematopoiesis.",

    "abstract": "The probability of single base modifications (mutations and DNA/RNA modifications) is expected to be highly influenced by the flanking nucleotides that surround them, known as the sequence context. This phenomenon may be mainly attributed to the enzyme that modifies or mutates the genetic material, since most enzymes tend to have specific sequence contexts that dictate their activity. Thus, identification of context effects may lead to the discovery of additional editing sites or unknown enzymatic factors. Here, we develop a statistical model that allows for the detection and evaluation of the effects of different sequence contexts on mutation rates from deep population sequencing data. This task is computationally challenging, as the complexity of the model increases exponentially as the context size increases. We established our novel Bayesian method based on sparse model selection methods, with the leading assumption that the number of actual sequence contexts that directly influence mutation rates is minuscule compared to the number of possible sequence contexts. We show that our method is highly accurate on simulated data using pentanucleotide contexts, even when accounting for noisy data. We next analyze empirical population sequencing data from polioviruses and detect a significant enrichment in sequence contexts associated with deamination by the cellular deaminases ADAR 1/2. In the current era, where next generation sequencing data is highly abundant, our approach can be used on any population sequencing data to reveal context-dependent base alterations, and may assist in the discovery of novel mutable sites or editing sites.",

    "abstract": "AimGeneral trends in spatial patterns of macroscopic organisms diversity can be reasonably well predicted from correlative models, using for instance topo-climatic variables for plants and animals allowing inference over large scales. By contrast, soil microorganisms diversity is generally considered as mostly driven by edaphic variables and, therefore, difficult to extrapolate on a large spatial scale based on predictive models. Here, we compared the power of topo-climatic vs. edaphic variables for predicting the diversity of various soil protist groups at the regional scale.\\n\\nLocationSwiss western Alps.\\n\\nTaxaFull protist community and nine clades belonging to three functional groups: parasites (Apicomplexa, Oomycota, Phytomyxea), phagotrophs (Sarcomonadea, Tubulinea, Spirotrichea) and phototrophs (Chlorophyta, Trebouxiophyceae, Bacillariophyta).\\n\\nMethodsWe extracted soil environmental DNA from 178 sites along a wide range of elevations with a random-stratified sampling design. We defined protist Operational Taxonomic Units assemblages by metabarcoding of the V4 region of the ribosomal RNA small sub-unit gene. We assessed and modelled the diversity (Shannon index) patterns of all selected groups as a function of topo-climatic and edaphic variables using Generalized Additive Models.\\n\\nResultsThe respective significance of topo-climatic and edaphic variables varied among taxonomic and - to a certain extent - functional groups: while many variables explained significantly the diversity of phototrophs this was less the case for parasites. Generally, topo-climatic variables had a better predictive power than edaphic variables, yet predictive power varied among taxonomic and functional groups.\\n\\nMain conclusionsTopo-climatic variables are, on average, better predictors of protist diversity at the landscape scale than edaphic variables, which opens the way to wide-scale sampling designs avoiding costly and time-consuming laboratory protocols. However, predictors of diversity differ considerably among taxonomic and functional groups; such relationships may be due to direct and/or indirect, e.g. biotic influences. Future prospects include using such spatial models to predict hotspots of diversity or pathogens outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "Disentangling the mechanisms of phenotypic shifts in response to environmental change is critical, and although studies increasingly disentangle phenotypic plasticity from evolutionary change, few explore the potential role for transgenerational plasticity in this context. Here, we evaluate the potential role that transgenerational plasticity plays in phenotypic divergence of acorn ants in response to urbanization. F2 generation worker ants (offspring of lab-born queens) exhibited similar divergence among urban and rural populations as F1 generation worker ants (offspring of field-born queens) indicating that evolutionary differentiation rather than transgenerational plasticity was responsible for shifts towards higher heat tolerance and diminished cold tolerance in urban acorn ants. Hybrid matings between urban and rural populations provided further insight into the genetic architecture of thermal adaptation. Heat tolerance of hybrids more resembled the urban-urban pure type, whereas cold tolerance of hybrids more resembled the rural-rural pure type. As a consequence, thermal tolerance traits in this system appear to be influenced by dominance rather than being purely additive traits, and heat and cold tolerance might be determined by separate genes. Though transgenerational plasticity does not explain divergence of acorn ant thermal tolerance, its role in divergence of other traits and across other urbanization gradients merits further study.",

    "abstract": "Evolution is at the core of the impending antibiotic crisis. Sustainable therapy must thus account for the adaptive potential of pathogens. One option is to exploit evolutionary trade-offs, like collateral sensitivity, where evolved resistance to one antibiotic causes hypersensitivity to another one. To date, the evolutionary stability and thus clinical utility of this trade-off is unclear. We performed a critical experimental test on this key requirement, using evolution experiments with Pseudomonas aeruginosa combined with genomic and genetic analyses, and identified three main outcomes: (i) bacteria commonly failed to counter hypersensitivity and went extinct; (ii) hypersensitivity sometimes converted into multidrug resistance; and (iii) resistance gains occasionally caused re-sensitization to the previous drug, thereby maintaining the trade-off. Drug order affected the evolutionary outcome, most likely due to variation in fitness costs and epistasis among adaptive mutations. Our finding of robust genetic trade-offs and drug-order effects can guide design of evolution-informed antibiotic therapy.",

    "abstract": "Excessive alcohol intake is associated with 5.9% of global deaths. However, this figure is especially acute in men such that 7.6% of deaths can be attributed to alcohol intake. Previous studies identified a significant interaction between genotypes of the galanin (GAL) gene with anxiety and alcohol abuse in different male populations but were unable to define a mechanism. To address these issues the current study analysed the human UK Biobank cohort and identified a significant interaction (n=115,865; p=0.0007) between allelic variation (GG or CA genotypes) in the highly conserved human GAL5.1 enhancer, alcohol intake (AUDIT questionnaire scores) and anxiety in men that was consistent with these previous studies. Critically, disruption of GAL5.1 in mice using CRISPR genome editing significantly reduced GAL expression in the amygdala and hypothalamus whilst producing a corresponding reduction in ethanol intake in KO mice. Intriguingly, we also found evidence of reduced anxiety-like behaviour in male GAL5.1KO animals mirroring that seen in humans. Using bioinformatic analysis and co-transfection studies we further identified the EGR1 transcription factor, that is co expressed with GAL in amygdala and hypothalamus, as being important in the protein kinase C (PKC) supported activity of the GG genotype of GAL5.1 but less so in the CA genotype. Our unique study uses a novel combination of human association analysis, CRISPR genome editing in mice, animal behavioural analysis and cell culture studies to identify a highly conserved regulatory mechanism linking anxiety and alcohol intake that might contribute to increased susceptibility to anxiety and alcohol abuse in men.",

Faster male development during grow-out phase is considered a major problem that generate heterogeneous sizes of fish at harvest. Identifying genomic regions associated with sex determination in Nile tilapia is a research topic of great interest. The objective of this study was to identify genomic variants associated with sex determination in three commercial populations of Nile tilapia. Whole-genome sequencing of 326 individuals was performed, and a total of 2.4 million high-quality bi-allelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted to identify markers associated with the binary sexual trait (males = 0; females = 1). A mixed logistic regression GWAS model was fitted and a genome-wide significant signal comprising 36 SNPs, located on chromosome 23 spanning a genomic region of 536 kb, was identified. Ten out of these 36 genetic variants, intercept the anti-Mullerian hormone gene. Other significant SNPs were located in the neighboring Amh gene region. This gene has been strongly associated with sex determination in several vertebrate species, playing an essential role in the differentiation of male and female reproductive tissue in early stages of development. This finding provides useful information to better understand the genetic mechanisms underlying sex determination in Nile tilapia.",

The etiology of the effect of exercise on tumour progression is unclear, as are the cellular actors involved. We show here that exercise-induced reduction in tumour growth is dependent on CD8+ T cells and that lactate, which is produced at high levels during exertion, increases proliferative capacity and cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells. We found that at elevated levels lactate is used as a fuel during T cell activation. We further found that injection of lactate into animals can reduce malignant tumour growth in a dose-and CD8+ T cell-dependent manner. These data demonstrate that lactate can act to increase the anti-tumour activity of cytotoxic T cells, and in so doing, reduce cancer progression.",

For antigen targeting to tolerizing antigen presenting cells, we used a recombinant antibody directed to the Dendritic Cells (DC)-Asialoglycoprotein receptor (DC-ASGPR). The intradermal administration of an anti-DC-ASGPR-MOG fusion protein, but not a control anti-DC-ASGPR-PSA (prostate specific antigen) protein, protected monkeys committed to develop EAE. Although effective treatment did not modify anti-MOG IgG production, it prevented the CD4+ T lymphocyte activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Moreover, animals treated with anti-DC-ASGPR-MOG experienced a rise of MOG-specific CD4+CD25+FOXP3+CD39+ regulatory T cells as well as a TGF{beta}1, TGF{beta}2 and IL-8 upsurge after rhMOG re-immunization. Our results indicate that the pathogenicity of autoantibodies directed to MOG is mitigated in the presence of MOG-specific regulatory lymphocytes.

    "abstract": "The applications of fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) are broad covering diagnostic and clinical extents of brain function, which involves the analysis of BOLD (blood oxygen level-dependent) contrast signals. The BOLD signals are sourced from both neural and metabolic functions, and thus to enable a detailed examination of fMRI studies, methods are sought to separate the neural and metabolic functions, such that the neural component, which is often the metric of interest, can be independently examined, especially in relation to neural connectivity. In this work, a modeling approach is developed that separates the neural and metabolic functions from the overall BOLD signal. The newly developed model is initially developed within a linear framework and demonstrates excellent comparison in data fit at 97.4% to the three Gamma function, which has been widely used to characterize fMRI BOLD experimental data. The neural component of the model formulation is comprised of a proper transfer function of two poles and two zeros, and characterizes the salient features of the BOLD signal, including the initial dip, peak, undershoot, and stabilization period. The linear model is extended to characterize nonlinear fMRI BOLD signal responses through the integration of saturation functions to both the leading and trailing edges of the signal. The nonlinear model representation not only explains the muted response in amplitude and oscillations, but also explains nuanced oscillations during the hold and settling phases of fMRI BOLD responses as exemplified in comparison to published data of sensorimotor responses. Further, the newly developed decomposition is derived within a framework for modeling neurovascular coupling environments, and thus lends credibility to the modeling framework. In developing the decomposition of the neural and metabolic transfer functions, it is a conclusion that the BOLD signal correlates very well with the fast dynamics associated with neural response to external stimuli.\\n\\nGraphical Abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=155 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/573006_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (17K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1171945org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17c3c0aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@149eebborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d840e1_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG The normalized impulse response of the BOLD signal and the corresponding neural activity according to the newly developed model.

This process of event segmentation engages working memory (WM) for tracking the flow of events and impacts subsequent memory accuracy. WM is limited in how much information is retained (i.e., WM capacity) and for how long the information is retained (i.e., forgetting rate). It is unclear which aspect of WM limitations affects event segmentation. In two separate experiments with multiple tasks, we estimated participants WM capacity and forgetting rate in a dynamic context and evaluated their relationship to event segmentation. The results across tasks show that individuals who reported more movie segments than others (fine-segmenters) have a faster decaying WM. A separate task assessing long-term memory retrieval reveals that the coarse-segmenters have better recognition of temporal order of events in contrast to the fine-segmenters who performed better at free recall. The findings show that event segmentation employs dissociable memory strategies and depends on how long information is retained in WM.",

In psychological and physiological literature those two systems have been labelled as Pacinian and non-Pacinian channels. However, we present evidence that low-frequency spike trains in Pacinian afferents can readily induce a vibratory percept with the same low frequency attributes as sinusoidal stimuli of the same frequency thus demonstrating a universal frequency decoding system. We achieved this using brief low-amplitude pulsatile mechanical stimuli to selectively activate Pacinian afferents. This indicates that spiking pattern, regardless of receptor type, determines vibrotactile frequency perception. This mechanism may underlie the constancy of vibrotactile frequency perception across different skin regions innervated by distinct afferent types.",

    "abstract": "Micro-architectural characteristics of white matter can be inferred through analysis of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI). The diffusion-dependent signal can be analyzed through several methods, with the tensor model being the most frequently used due to its straightforward interpretation and relaxed acquisition parameters. While valuable information can be gained from the tensor-derived metrics in regions of homogeneous tissue organization, this model does not provide reliable microstructural information at crossing fiber regions, which are pervasive throughout human white matter. Several multiple fiber models have been proposed that seem to overcome the limitations of the tensor, with few providing per-bundle dMRI-derived metrics. However, biological interpretations of such metrics are limited by the lack of histological confirmation. To this end, we developed a straightforward biological validation framework. Unilateral retinal ischemia was induced in ten rats, which resulted in axonal (Wallerian) degeneration of the corresponding optic nerve, while the contralateral was left intact; the intact and injured axonal populations meet at the optic chiasm as they cross the midline, generating a fiber crossing region in which each population has different diffusion properties. Five rats served as controls. High-resolution ex vivo dMRI was acquired five weeks after experimental procedures. We correlated and compared histology to per-bundle descriptors derived from three novel methodologies for dMRI analysis (constrained spherical deconvolution and two multi-tensor representations). We found a tight correlation between axonal density (as evaluated through automatic segmentation of histological sections) with per-bundle apparent fiber density and fractional anisotropy (derived from dMRI). The multi-fiber methods explored were able to correctly identify the damaged fiber populations in a region of fiber crossings (chiasm). Our results provide validation of metrics that bring substantial and clinically useful information about white-matter tissue at crossing fiber regions. Our proposed validation framework is useful to validate other current and future dMRI methods.",

Similarly, the dorsal lateral pallium (DL) is essential for spatial learning in teleost fish. The DL of weakly electric gymnotiform fish receives sensory inputs from the preglomerular nucleus (PG), which has been hypothesized to encode the temporal sequence of electrosensory or visual landmark/food encounters. Here, we show that DL neurons have a hyperpolarized resting membrane potential combined with a high and dynamic spike threshold that increases following each spike. Current-evoked spikes in DL cells are followed by a strong small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (SK) mediated after-hyperpolarizing potential (AHP). Together, these properties prevent high frequency and continuous spiking. The resulting sparseness of discharge and dynamic threshold suggest that DL neurons meet theoretical requirements for generating spatial memory engrams by decoding the landmark/food encounter sequences encoded by PG neurons.",

Here, we applied multiphoton imaging, 3D digital reconstructions and computational simulations to generate spatially-resolved geometrical and functional models of human liver tissue at different stages of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We identified a set of new morphometric cellular parameters correlated with disease progression. Moreover, we found profound topological defects in the 3D bile canaliculi (BC) network. Personalized biliary fluid dynamic simulations predicted an increased pericentral biliary pressure and zonated cholestasis, consistent with elevated cholestatic biomarkers in patients sera. Our spatially-resolved models of human liver tissue can contribute to high-definition medicine by identifying quantitative multi-parametric cellular and tissue signatures to define disease progression and provide new insights into NAFLD pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Directional organ growth allows the plant root system to strategically cover its surroundings. Intercellular auxin transport is aligned with the gravity vector in the primary root tips, facilitating downward organ bending at the lower root flank. Here we show that cytokinin signaling functions as a lateral root specific anti-gravitropic component, promoting the radial distribution of the root system. We performed a genome-wide association study and revealed that signal peptide processing of Cytokinin Oxidase 2 (CKX2) affects its enzymatic activity and, thereby, determines the degradation of cytokinins in natural Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. Cytokinin signaling interferes with growth at the upper lateral root flank and thereby prevents downward bending. Our interdisciplinary approach revealed that two phytohormonal cues at opposite organ flanks counterbalance each others negative impact on growth, suppressing organ growth towards gravity and allow for radial expansion of the root system.",

    "abstract": "Microbial cooperation enables groups of conspecific cells to perform tasks that cannot be performed efficiently by individual cells, such as utilization of various secreted  public-good molecules, communication via quorum-sensing, or the formation of multicellular structures. Cooperation is often costly and therefore susceptible to exploitation by  cheater cells, which enjoy the benefit of cooperation without investing in it. While population structure is key to the maintenance of cooperation, it remains unclear whether other mechanisms help in stabilizing microbial cooperation. Like other microbial traits, cooperation is often governed by complex regulatory networks, and one reoccurring motif is an  intercellular positive-feedback loop, where a secreted molecule, e.g. a public-good or a quorum-sensing signaling molecule, activates its own production in all surrounding cells. Here we investigate the role of intercellular feedbacks in the maintenance of bacterial cooperation. We combine theory with a synthetic-biology approach, using swarming motility of Bacillus subtilis engineered variants, to compare the response of  open-loop and feedback cooperators to the presence of cheaters. We find that positive feedbacks on cooperative behaviors - either directly or through a feedback on quorum-sensing - maintain cooperation in a broader range of environments, relieving the requirement for a strong population structure. Our results directly demonstrate the stabilizing effect of intercellular positive feedbacks on cooperative behaviors, and suggests an explanation for their abundance in regulatory networks of bacterial cooperation.",

    "abstract": "A twelve-month study was conducted on changes in fatty acid composition and pesticide residues in honeybees and beebread. In honeybees, saturated fatty acid and monounsaturated fatty acid gradually increased as summer began then decreased when spring started, and polyunsaturated fatty acid had an opposite seasonal trend. Similar fluctuation was observed in the beebread collected from the same hive as those honeybees through summer to fall, especially in the essential fatty acids omega-6 and omega-3. Honeybees lipid metabolism can be disrupted after being exposed to a sub-lethal level of pesticide. Although three out of sixteen analyzed pesticides were detected in beebread samples summer through fall in our study, we were not able to find any negative affect of those pesticides on the honeybees fatty acid composition. Temporary field-realistic pesticide exposure may weaken honeybees but are unlikely to show any reflection in their fat bodies if the colony was otherwise healthy.",

    "abstract": "Finding key genes which are relative with cancer is the first essential step to understand what has taken place in the tumor cell. At present, the most methods which can discover key genes make a contrast between normal samples and tumor samples and base on the statistical test. However, those methods face on some problems like the insufficient of statistical test in unbalanced samples, defect of only using single data that can not display the holistic situation in tumor cell. For solving those issues, i proposed a innovation method that uses semi-supervised and unsupervised algorithm to discover key genes which are linked with cancer. The genes in the final result list are not only in the double category but with distinct hierarchy and those genes are all detected from diversity data like methylation, gene expression RNA-Seq, exon expression RNA-Seq and so on. At last, for comparing the result of this method and traditional statistical method, i used the conception of information gain ratio to prove the advantage of this deep learning method in mathematical.",
