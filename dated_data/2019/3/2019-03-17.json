    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified thousands of variants associated with complex traits, but their biological interpretation often remains unclear. Most of these variants overlap with expression QTLs (eQTLs), indicating their potential involvement in the regulation of gene expression.\\n\\nHere, we propose an advanced transcriptome-wide summary statistics-based Mendelian Randomization approach (called TWMR) that uses multiple SNPs jointly as instruments and multiple gene expression traits as exposures, simultaneously.\\n\\nWhen applied to 43 human phenotypes it uncovered 2,369 genes whose blood expression is putatively associated with at least one phenotype resulting in 3,913 gene-trait associations; of note, 36% of them had no genome-wide significant SNP nearby in previous GWAS analysis. Using independent association summary statistics (UKBiobank), we confirmed that the majority of these loci were missed by conventional GWAS due to power issues. Noteworthy among these novel links is educational attainment-associated BSCL2, known to carry mutations leading to a mendelian form of encephalopathy. We similarly unraveled novel pleiotropic causal effects suggestive of mechanistic connections, e.g. the shared genetic effects of GSDMB in rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and Crohns disease.\\n\\nOur advanced Mendelian Randomization unlocks hidden value from published GWAS through higher power in detecting associations. It better accounts for pleiotropy and unravels new biological mechanisms underlying complex and clinical traits.",

Although intensive efforts have focused on gene repression and silencing mutations, much less is known about posttranslational control of E-cadherin expression in cancer. SPCA2 is a secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPase that is down-regulated in metastatic breast cancer. We show that SPCA2 is tightly co-expressed with epithelial signature genes and required for E-cadherin biogenesis and cell surface expression. Unexpectedly, this function is uncoupled from Ca2+ pumping and mediated by binding to E-cadherin.

    "abstract": "Cities face rapid changes leading to increasing inequalities and emerging public health issues that require cost-effective interventions. The urban exposome framework constitutes a novel approach in tackling city-wide challenges, such as those of drinking water quality and quality of life. In this proof-of-concept study, we presented part of the urban exposome of Limassol (Cyprus) focusing on chemical and microbial drinking water quality parameters and their association with urban neighborhood indicators. A perceptions study and an urban population study was conducted. We mapped the water quality parameters and participants opinions on city life (i.e. neighborhood life, health care and green space access) using quarters (small administrative areas) as the reference unit of the city. In an exploratory environment-wide association study analysis, we used all variables (questionnaire responses and water quality metrics) to describe correlations between them accounting, also, for self-reported health status. Overall, urban drinking-water quality using conventional indicators of chemical (disinfection byproducts-trihalomethanes) and microbial (coliforms, E. coli, and Enterococci) quality did not raise particular concerns. The general health and chronic health status of the urban participants were significantly (all >FDR corrected p value of 0.1) associated with different health conditions such as hypertension and asthma, or having financial issues in access to dental care. Additionally, correlations between trihalomethanes and participant characteristics (e.g. household cleaning, drinking water habits) were documented. This proof-of-concept study showed the potential of using integrative approaches to develop urban exposomic profiles and identifying within-city differentiated environmental and health indicators. The characterization of the urban exposome of Limassol will be expanded via the inclusion of biomonitoring tools and untargeted metabolomics platforms.",

    "abstract": "Proteins associated with familial neurodegenerative disease often aggregate in patients neurons. Several such proteins, e.g. TDP-43, aggregate and are toxic when expressed in yeast. Deletion of the ATXN2 ortholog, PBP1, reduces yeast TDP-43 toxicity, which led to identification of ATXN2 as an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) risk factor and therapeutic target. Likewise, new yeast neurodegenerative disease models could facilitate identification of other risk factors and targets. Mutations in SS18L1, encoding the calcium-responsive transactivator (CREST) chromatin-remodeling protein, are associated with ALS. We show that CREST is toxic in yeast and forms nuclear and occasionally cytoplasmic foci that stain with Thioflavin-T, a dye indicative of amyloid-like protein. Like the yeast chromatin-remodeling factor SWI1, CREST inhibits silencing of FLO genes. Toxicity of CREST is enhanced by the [PIN+] prion and reduced by deletion of the HSP104 chaperone required for the propagation of many yeast prions. Likewise, deletion of PBP1 reduced CREST toxicity and aggregation. In accord with the yeast data, we show that the Drosophila ortholog of human ATXN2, dAtx2, is a potent enhancer of CREST toxicity. Downregulation of dAtx2 in flies overexpressing CREST in retinal ganglion cells was sufficient to largely rescue the severe degenerative phenotype induced by human CREST. Overexpression caused considerable co-localization of CREST and PBP1/ATXN2 in cytoplasmic foci in both yeast and mammalian cells. Thus, co-aggregation of CREST and PBP1/ATXN2 may serve as one of the mechanisms of PBP1/ATXN2-mediated toxicity. These results extend the spectrum of ALS associated proteins whose toxicity is regulated by PBP1/ATXN2, suggesting that therapies targeting ATXN2 may be effective for a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases.\\n\\nAuthor summaryMutations in the calcium-responsive transactivator (CREST) protein have been shown to cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Here we show that the human CREST protein expressed in yeast forms largely nuclear aggregates and is toxic. We also show that the HSP104 chaperone required for propagation of yeast prions is likewise required for CREST toxicity. Furthermore deletion of HSP104 affects CREST aggregation. ATXN2, previously shown to modify ALS toxicity caused by mutations in the TDP-43 encoding gene, also modifies toxicity of CREST expressed in either yeast or flies. In addition, deletion of the yeast ATXN2 ortholog reduces CREST aggregation. These results extend the spectrum of ALS associated proteins whose toxicity is regulated by ATXN2, suggesting that therapies targeting ATXN2 may be effective for a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "The Collaborative Cross (CC) is a mouse genetic reference population whose range of applications includes quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. The design of a CC QTL mapping study involves multiple decisions, including which and how many strains to use, and how many replicates per strain to phenotype, all viewed within the context of hypothesized QTL architecture. Until now, these decisions have been informed largely by early power analyses that were based on simulated, hypothetical CC genomes. Now that more than 50 CC strains are available and more than 70 CC genomes have been observed, it is possible to characterize power based on realized CC genomes. We report power analyses based on extensive simulations and examine several key considerations: 1) the number of strains and biological replicates, 2) the QTL effect size, 3) the presence of population structure, and 4) the distribution of functionally distinct alleles among the founder strains at the QTL. We also provide general power estimates to aide in the design of future experiments. All analyses were conducted with our R package, SPARCC (Simulated Power Analysis in the Realized Collaborative Cross), developed for performing either large scale power analyses or those tailored to particular CC experiments.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental question in community ecology is the relative influence of niche versus neutral processes in determining ecosystem dynamics. The extent to which these processes structured early animal communities is yet to be explored. Here we use spatial point process analyses (SPPA) to determine the influence of niche versus neutral processes on early total-group metazoan paleocommunities from the Ediacaran Period [~]565 million years in age. Preservation of these sessile organisms in large in-situ populations on exposed bedding planes enables inference of the most likely underlying processes governing their spatial distributions by SPPA. We conducted comprehensive spatial mapping of six of the largest Ediacaran paleocommunities in Newfoundland, Canada and Charnwood Forest, UK using LiDAR, photogrammetry and a laser-line probe. For each paleocommunity we determined the best-fit spatial model for each univariate and bivariate species distribution, comparing four sets of spatial models (complete spatial randomness, dispersal, habitat, and combined dispersal with habitat) using goodness-of-fit tests. Random and dispersal models are considered neutral processes while habitat and combined models are considered niche processes. We find the dynamics of these paleocommunities to be dominated by neutral processes, with limited influence from niche processes. Our findings are consistent with community model predictions of when neutral dynamics dominate, but are in stark contrast to the niche-dominated communities of the modern marine realm. Thus, while the underlying processes determining metazoan community assembly appear to have been in place since the appearance of the first macroscopic, complex animals, the dynamics of these early metazoan communities were fundamentally different to those of extant communities.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe extent to which habitat and dispersal processes structure the earliest animal communities found during the Ediacaran Period [~]565 million years ago, is unknown. In this study we analyse six of the largest and most diverse fossil assemblages from Newfoundland, Canada and Charnwood Forest, UK, using spatial point processes analyses to determine the relative influence of habitat processes (niche) and dispersal processes (neutral) on the spatial distribution of taxa. The vast majority of Ediacaran taxon distributions were controlled by neutral processes, in striking contrast to niche-dominated modern marine ecosystems, but consistent with model predictions of when neutral dynamics dominate communities.

    "abstract": "Species population trends are fundamental to conservation, underpinning lUCN red-list classifications, many national lists of threatened species and are also used globally to convey to policy makers the state of nature. Clearly, its crucial to quantify how much we can trust population trend data. Yet many studies analyzing large numbers of population time series lack a straightforward way to estimate confidence in each trend. Here we artificially degrade 27,930 waterbird population time series to see how often subsets of the data correctly estimate the direction and magnitude of each populations true trend. We find you need to sample many years to be confident that there is no significant trend in a population. Conversely, if a significant trend is detected, even from only a small subset of years, this is likely to be representative of the populations true trend. This means that if a significant decline is detected in a population, it is likely to be correct and conservation action should be taken immediately, but if the trend is insignificant, confidence in this can only be high with many samples. Our full results provide a clear and quantitative way to assign confidence to species trends, and lays the foundation for similar studies of other taxa that can help to add rigor to large-scale population analyses.",

    "abstract": "Traditional views on how humans adapt movements to perturbations of sensory feedback emphasize a fundamental role for automatic, implicit correction of sensory prediction errors. However, it is now clear that adaptive behaviour also involves deliberate, strategic movement corrections. Such strategic processes have recently been argued to underlie the latent retention of sensorimotor adaptation, evident in improved adaptation to previously encountered perturbations; a phenomenon termed \"savings\". It remains unclear, however, whether savings results from prior experience of sensory prediction errors, task errors, or both. Here, we used perturbations of target locations and hand position feedback during reaching to dissociate the contributions of task and sensory prediction errors to latent sensorimotor memory. We show that prior learning to correct for task errors is required to improve adaptation to rotated hand position feedback, whereas a history of sensory prediction errors is neither sufficient nor obligatory for savings. A history of correcting for task errors, induced by experimentally perturbing the target location instead of perturbing sensory feedback of movement, improved adaptation to visuomotor perturbations that were never before encountered. Limiting movement preparation time further showed that this learning consists of two distinct components: 1) a strategic component that is flexible enough to facilitate corrective responses in the opposite direction, but that requires substantial preparation time, and 2) a set of inflexible, cached, stimulus-response associations between targets and reach directions, that can be expressed under time-pressure when similar task conditions are experienced. The results emphasise that adaptive responses to sensorimotor perturbations take multiple forms.",

Furthermore, Zea binds RIG-I, the vertebrate non-self-RNA innate immunity sensor and potentiates RIG-I-signaling leading to interferon {beta} production.

    "abstract": "Invasive species often exhibit rapid evolution in their introduced ranges despite the genetic bottlenecks that are thought to accompany the translocation of small numbers of founders; however, some invasions may not fit this \"genetic paradox.\" The invasive cane toad (Rhinella marina) displays high phenotypic variation across its environmentally heterogeneous introduced Australian range. Here, we used three genome-wide datasets to characterize population structure and genetic diversity in invasive toads: RNA-Seq data generated from spleens sampled from the toads native range in French Guiana, the introduced population in Hawaii that was the source of Australian founders, and Australia; RNA-Seq data generated from brains sampled more extensively in Hawaii and Australia; and previously published RADSeq data from transects across Australia. We found that toads form three genetic clusters: (1) native range toads, (2) toads from the source population in Hawaii and long-established areas near introduction sites in Australia, and (3) toads from more recently established northern Australian sites. In addition to strong divergence between native and invasive populations, we find evidence for a reduction in genetic diversity after introduction. However, we do not see this reduction in loci putatively under selection, suggesting that genetic diversity may have been maintained at ecologically relevant traits, or that mutation rates were high enough to maintain adaptive potential. Nonetheless, cane toads encounter novel environmental challenges in Australia and appear to respond to selection across environmental breaks; the transition between genetic clusters occurs at a point along the invasion transect where temperature rises and rainfall decreases. We identify loci known to be involved in resistance to heat and dehydration that show evidence of selection in Australian toads. Despite well-known predictions regarding genetic drift and spatial sorting during invasion, this study highlights that natural selection occurs rapidly and plays a vital role in shaping the structure of invasive populations.\n\nAuthor SummaryDespite longstanding evidence for the link between genetic diversity and population viability, the \"genetic paradox\" concept reflects the observation that invasive populations are successful in novel environments despite a putative reduction in genetic diversity. However, some recent studies have suggested that successful invasions may often occur due to an absence of obstacles such as genetic diversity loss or novel adaptive challenges. The recent emergence of genome-wide technologies provides us with the tools to study this question comprehensively by assessing both overall genetic diversity, and diversity of loci that underlie ecologically relevant traits. The invasive cane toad is a useful model because there is abundant phenotypic evidence of rapid adaptation during invasion. Our results suggest strong genetic divergence between native and invasive populations, and a reduction in overall genetic diversity; however, we do not see this reduction when solely assessing ecologically relevant loci. This could be for reasons that support or refute the genetic paradox. Further studies may provide perspectives from other systems, allowing us to explore how variables such as propagule size affect the fit of an invasion to the model of the paradox. Studying invasive species remains important due to their largely negative impacts on the environment and economy.",

Here, EEG signals were recorded on humans performing a conscious visual detection task, while they received brief rhythmic or random noninvasive stimulation patterns delivered to the right Frontal Eye Field prior to the onset of a lateralized target. Compared to random patterns, rhythmic high-beta patterns led to greater entrainment of local oscillations (i.e., increased power and phase alignment at the stimulation frequency), and to higher conscious detection of contralateral targets. When stimulation succeeded in enhancing visual detection, the magnitude of oscillation entrainment correlated with visual performance increases.

    "abstract": "Structural information on the interactions of proteins with other molecules is plentiful, and for some proteins and protein families, there may be 100s of available structures. It can be very difficult for a scientist who is not trained in structural bioinformatics to access this information comprehensively. Previously, we developed the Protein Common Interface Database (ProtCID), which provided clusters of the interfaces of full-length protein chains as a means of identifying biological assemblies. Because proteins consist of domains that act as modular functional units, we have extended the analysis in ProtCID to the individual domain level. This has greatly increased the number of large protein-protein clusters in ProtCID, enabling the generation of hypotheses on the structures of biological assemblies of many systems. The analysis of domain families allows us to extend ProtCID to the interactions of domains with peptides, nucleic acids, and ligands. ProtCID provides complete annotations and coordinate sets for every cluster.",

    "abstract": "A progressive loss of protein homeostasis is characteristic of aging and a driver of neurodegeneration. To investigate this process quantitatively, we characterized proteome dynamics during brain aging in the short-lived vertebrate Nothobranchius furzeri combining transcriptomics and proteomics. We detected a progressive reduction in the correlation between protein and mRNA, mainly due to post-transcriptional mechanisms that account for over 40% of the age-regulated proteins. These changes cause a progressive loss of stoichiometry in several protein complexes, including ribosomes, which show impaired assembly / dis-assembly and are enriched in protein aggregates in old brains. Mechanistically, we show that reduction of proteasome activity is an early event during brain aging and is sufficient to induce proteomic signatures of aging and loss of stoichiometry in vivo. Using longitudinal transcriptomic data, we show that the magnitude of early life decline in proteasome levels is the major risk factor for mortality. Our work defines causative events in the aging process that can be targeted to prevent loss of protein homeostasis and delay the onset of age-related neurodegeneration.\n\nHighlightsO_LIProgressive loss of stoichiometry affects multiple protein complexes\nC_LIO_LIRibosomes aggregate in old brains\nC_LIO_LIPartial reduction of proteasome activity is sufficient to induce loss of stoichiometry\nC_LIO_LIReduced proteasome levels are a major risk factor for early death in killifish\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "5-Methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (acronymized as 5-MeO-DMT) is sui generis among the numerous naturally-occurring psychoactive substances due to its unparalleled ego-dissolving effects which can culminate in a state of nondual consciousness (which is phenomenologically similar to transformative peak experiences described in various ancient contemplative traditions, e.g., Advaita Ved[a]nta, Mah[a]y[a]na Buddhism). The enigmatic molecule is endogenous to the human brain and has profound psychological effects which are hitherto only very poorly understood due to the absence of scientifically controlled human experimental trials. Its exact neuronal receptor binding profile is a matter of ongoing scientific research, however, its remarkable psychoactivity is presumably mediated via agonism of the 5-HTO_SCPCAP2AC_SCPCAP (serotonin) receptor subtype. Anthropological/ethnopharmacological evidence indicates that various cultures utilized 5-MeO-DMT containing plants for medicinal, psychological, and spiritual purposes for millennia. In this paper we argue that this naturally occurring serotonergic compound could be fruitfully utilized as a neurochemical research tool which has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the cognitive and neuronal processes which underpin cognition and creativity (downregulation of the default-mode network, increased neuronal functional connectivity, etc.). An eclectic interdisciplinary perspective is adopted, and we present converging evidence from a plurality of sources in support of this conjecture. Specifically, we suggest that 5-MeO-DMT has great potential in this respect due to its incommensurable capacity to completely disintegrate self-referential cognitive/neuronal processes (viz., \\\"ego death\\\"). The importance of unbiased systematic scientific research on naturally occurring endogenous psychoactive compounds is discussed from a Jamesian radical empiricism perspective and potential scenarios of abuse are discussed (particularly in the context of military torture).",

    "abstract": "An underexplored question in evolutionary genetics concerns the extent to which mutational bias in the production of genetic variation influences outcomes and pathways of adaptive molecular evolution. In the genomes of at least some vertebrate taxa, an important form of mutation bias involves changes at CpG dinucleotides: If the DNA nucleotide cytosine (C) is immediately 5 to guanine (G) on the same coding strand, then - depending on methylation status - point mutations at both sites occur at an elevated rate relative to mutations at non-CpG sites. Here we examine experimental data from case studies in which it has been possible to identify the causative substitutions that are responsible for adaptive changes in the functional properties of vertebrate hemoglobin (Hb). Specifically, we examine the molecular basis of convergent increases in Hb-O2 affinity in high-altitude birds. Using a data set of experimentally verified, affinity-enhancing mutations in the Hbs of highland avian taxa, we tested whether causative changes are enriched for mutations at CpG dinucleotides relative to the frequency of CpG mutations among all possible missense mutations. The tests revealed that a disproportionate number of causative amino acid replacements were attributable to CpG mutations, suggesting that mutation bias can influence outcomes of molecular adaptation.",

While many efforts have focused on understanding the role of tau protein in neurodegeneration, there has been little done to systematically analyze and study the structures within taus encoding RNA and their connection to disease pathology. Knowledge of RNA structure can provide insights into disease mechanisms and how to affect protein production for therapeutic benefit. Using computational methods based on thermodynamic stability and evolutionary conservation, we identified structures throughout the tau pre-mRNA, especially at exon-intron junctions and within the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). In particular, structures were identified at twenty exon-intron junctions. The 5' UTR contains one structured region, which lies within a known internal ribosome entry site. The 3' UTR contains eight structured regions, including one that contains a polyadenylation signal. A series of functional experiments were carried out to assess the effects of mutations associated with mis-regulation of alternative splicing of exon 10 and to identify regions of the 3' UTR that contain cis-regulatory elements. These studies defined novel structural regions within the mRNA that affect stability and pre-mRNA splicing and may lead to new therapeutic targets for treating tau-associated diseases.",

Here we report that morphine analgesia and MOR signaling require neuronal Programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1). We found that morphine-induced antinociception following systemic or intrathecal injection was compromised in Pd1-/- mice. Morphine analgesia was also abrogated in wild-type mice after treatment with Nivolumab, a clinically used anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody. Morphine produced analgesia by suppressing calcium currents in DRG neurons and excitatory synaptic transmission in spinal cord neurons, but strikingly, both actions were impaired by PD-1 blockade. In a mouse model of bone cancer, the antinociceptive action of systemic morphine was compromised in Pd1-/- mice. Finally, PD-L1 and morphine produce synergistic analgesia. Our findings demonstrate that PD-1 also acts as a neuro checkpoint inhibitor and mediates opioid-induced analgesia and MOR signaling in neurons.",

Through major genomics sequencing efforts such as the Personal Genome Project, the Vertebrate Genome Project (VGP), the Earth Biogenome Project (EBP) and the Genome in a Bottle project (GIAB), a variety of sequencing datasets from mother-father-child trios of various diploid species are becoming available.\\n\\nCurrent trio assembly approaches are not designed to incorporate long-read sequencing data from parents in a trio, and therefore require relatively high coverages of costly long-read data to produce high-quality assemblies. Thus, building a trio-aware assembler capable of producing accurate and chromosomal-scale diploid genomes in a pedigree, while being cost-effective in terms of sequencing costs, is a pressing need of the genomics community.\\n\\nResultsWe present a novel pedigree-graph-based approach to diploid assembly using accurate Illumina data and long-read Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) data from all related individuals, thereby generalizing our previous work on single individuals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our pedigree approach on a simulated trio of pseudo-diploid yeast genomes with different heterozygosity rates, and real data from Arabidopsis Thaliana. We show that we require as little as 30x coverage Illumina data and 15x PacBio data from each individual in a trio to generate chromosomal-scale phased assemblies.

Sialyation is dependent on a continuous supply of sialic acid into Golgi organelles in the form of CMP-sialic acid. Translocation of CMP-sialic acid into Golgi is carried out by the CMP-sialic acid transporter (CST). Mutations in human CST are linked to glycosylation disorders, and CST is important for glycopathway engineering, as it is critical for sialyation efficiency of therapeutic glycoproteins. The mechanism of how CMP-sialic acid is recognized and translocated across Golgi membranes in exchange for CMP is poorly understood.

In spite of a progress made in general understanding of BBS aetiology, the molecular mechanism of cognitive impairment remains elusive. Here we report that loss of Bardet-Biedl syndrome proteins causes synaptic dysfunction in principal neurons providing possible explanation for cognitive impairment phenotype in BBS patients. Using synaptosomal proteomics and immunocytochemistry we demonstrate the presence of Bbs in postsynaptic density of hippocampal neurons. Loss of Bbs results in the significant reduction of dendritic spines in principal neurons of Bbs mice models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that spine deficiency correlates with events that destabilize spine architecture, such as, impaired spine membrane receptors signalling known to be involved in the maintenance of dendritic spines. Finally, we show that voluntary exercise rescues spine deficiency in the neurons. Based on our data, we propose a model in which Bbs proteins, similar to their function in primary cilia, regulate trafficking of signalling receptors into and out of the membrane of dendritic spines, thus providing the basis for synaptic plasticity.",

The most widely used statistic for quantitative comparisons is the p-value. However, p-values suffer from several shortcomings. The most prominent shortcoming that is relevant for quantitative comparisons is that p-values fail to convey the magnitude of differences. The differences between conditions are best quantified by the determination of effect size. To democratize the calculation of effect size, we have developed a web-based tool. The tool uses bootstrapping to resample mean or median values for each of the conditions and these values are used to calculate the effect size and their compatibility interval. The web tool generates a graphical output, showing the bootstrap distribution of the difference next to the actual data for optimal interpretation. A tabular output with statistics and effect sizes is also generated and the table can be supplemented with p-values that are calculated with a randomization test.

    "abstract": "Exercise-induced increases in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor {gamma} coactivator-1 (PGC-1) and p53 protein content in the nucleus mediate the initial phase of exercise-induced mitochondrial biogenesis. Here we investigated if exercise-induced increases in these and other markers of mitochondrial biogenesis were altered after 40 sessions of twice-daily high-volume high-intensity interval training (HVT) in human skeletal muscle. Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were collected from 10 healthy recreationally active participants before, immediately post, and 3h after a session of HIIE performed at the same absolute exercise intensity before and after HVT (Pre-HVT and Post-HVT, respectively). The protein content of common markers of exercise-induced mitochondrial biogenesis were assessed in nuclear- and cytosolic-enriched fractions by immunoblotting; mRNA contents of key transcription factors and mitochondrial genes were assessed by qPCR. Despite exercise-induced increases in PGC-1, p53, and plant homeodomain finger-containing protein 20 (PHF20) protein content, the phosphorylation of p53 and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (p-p53Ser15 and p-ACCSer79, respectively), and PGC-1 mRNA Pre-HVT, no significant changes were observed Post-HVT. Forty sessions of twice-daily high-intensity interval training blunted all of the measured exercise-induced molecular events associated with mitochondrial biogenesis that were observed Pre-HVT. Future studies should determine if this loss relates to the decrease in relative exercise intensity, habituation to the same exercise stimulus, or a combination of both.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWHumans often simultaneously pursue multiple plans at different time scales. The successful realization of non-immediate plans (e.g., post package after work) requires keeping track of a future plan while accomplishing other intermediate tasks (e.g., write a paper), a capacity known as prospective memory. This capacity requires the integration of noisy evidence from perceptual input with evidence from short-term working memory (WM) and longer-term or episodic memory (LTM/EM). Here we formulate a set of dual-task problems in empirical studies of prospective memory as problems of computational rationality, and ask how a rational model should exploit noisy perception and memory to maximize payoffs. The model combines reinforcement learning (optimal action selection) with evidence accumulation (optimal inference) in order to derive good decision parameters for optimal task performance (i.e., performing an ongoing task while monitoring for a cue that triggers executing a second prospective task). We compare model behavior to key accuracy and reaction time phenomena in human performance. Thus, we offer a normative approach to theorizing and modeling these phenomena without assumptions about mechanisms of attention or retrieval. This approach can be extended to study meta-parameters governing the boundedly rational use of memory in planned action in health, as well as compensatory mnemonic strategies that may be rational responses to disturbances of these mechanisms in neuropsychiatric disorders.",

In this study, we evaluate the performance of machine learning models trained on data from gene expression and phenotypic profiling assays, with models trained on chemical structure descriptors, for prediction of various drug mechanisms of action and target proteins. Models for several hundred mechanisms of actions and targets were trained using data on 1484 compounds characterized in both gene expression using L1000 profiles, and phenotypic profiling with cell painting assay. The results indicate that the accuracy of the three profiling technologies varies for different endpoints, and indicate a clear potential synergistic effect if these methods are combined. We also study the effect of predictive accuracy of data from different cell lines for L1000 profiles, showing that the choice of cell line has a non-negligible effect on the predictive accuracy.

Here, we investigate evidence for pleiotropic mechanisms that may explain the comorbidity between Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). These complex neurodevelopmental conditions often co-occur, but differ in their polygenetic association patterns, especially with educational attainment (EA), showing discordant association effects. Using multivariable regression analyses and existing genome-wide summary statistics based on 10,610 to 766,345 individuals, we demonstrate that EA-related polygenic variation is shared between ASD and ADHD. We show that different combinations of the same ASD and ADHD risk-increasing alleles can simultaneously re-capture known ASD-related positive and ADHD-related negative associations with EA. Such patterns, although to a lesser degree, were also present for combinations of other psychiatric disorders. These findings suggest pleiotropic mechanisms, where the same polygenic sites can encode multiple independent, even discordant, association patterns without involving distinct loci, and have implications for cross-disorder investigations.",

Here, we show that the intestinal microbiota programs diurnal metabolic rhythms in the mouse small intestine through histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3). The microbiota induced expression of intestinal epithelial HDAC3, which was recruited rhythmically to chromatin and produced synchronized diurnal oscillations in histone acetylation, metabolic gene expression, and nutrient uptake. HDAC3 also functioned non-canonically to coactivate estrogen related receptor  (ERR), inducing microbiota-dependent rhythmic transcription of the lipid transporter gene Cd36 and promoting lipid absorption and diet-and jet lag-induced obesity. Our findings reveal that HDAC3 integrates microbial and circadian cues to regulate diurnal metabolic rhythms, and pinpoint a key mechanism by which the microbiota controls host metabolism.\n\nOne sentence summaryThe intestinal microbiota induces daily metabolic rhythms and controls lipid uptake through the enzyme histone deacetylase 3.",

    "abstract": "Sequential neural activity has been observed in many parts of the brain and has been proposed as a neural mechanism for memory. The natural world expresses temporal relationships at a wide range of scales. Because we cannot know the relevant scales a priori it is desirable that memory, and thus the generated sequences, are scale-invariant. Although recurrent neural network models have been proposed as a mechanism for generating sequences, the requirements for scale-invariant sequences are not known. This paper reports the constraints that enable a linear recurrent neural network model to generate scale-invariant sequential activity. A straightforward eigendecomposition analysis results in two independent conditions that are required for scaleinvariance for connectivity matrices with real, distinct eigenvalues. First, the eigenvalues of the network must be geometrically spaced. Second, the eigenvectors must be related to one another via translation. These constraints are easily generalizable for matrices that have complex and distinct eigenvalues. Analogous albeit less compact constraints hold for matrices with degenerate eigenvalues. These constraints, along with considerations on initial conditions, provide a general recipe to build linear recurrent neural networks that support scale-invariant sequential activity.",

    "abstract": "One proposed factor contributing to the increased opioid overdose deaths is the increased frequency of synthetic opioids, including fentanyl and fentanyl analogs. A treatment strategy currently under development to address the ongoing opioid crisis is immunopharmacotherapies or opioid-targeted vaccines. The present study determined the effectiveness and selectivity of a fentanyl-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine to alter the behavioral effects of fentanyl and a structurally dissimilar mu-opioid agonist oxycodone in male rhesus monkeys (n=3-4). Fentanyl and oxycodone produced dose-dependent suppression of behavior in an assay of schedule-controlled responding and antinociception in an assay of thermal nociception (50{degrees}C). Acute naltrexone (0.032 mg/kg) produced an approximate 10-fold potency shift for fentanyl to decrease operant responding. The fentanyl vaccine was administered at weeks 0, 2, 4, 9, 19, and 44 and fentanyl or oxycodone potencies in both behavioral assays were redetermined over the course of 49 weeks. The vaccine significantly and selectively shifted fentanyl potency at least 10-fold in both assays at several time points over the entire experimental period. Mid-point titer levels were significantly correlated with fentanyl antinociceptive potency shifts. Antibody affinity for fentanyl as measured by a competitive binding assay increased over time to around 3-4 nM. The fentanyl vaccine also significantly increased fentanyl plasma levels approximately 6-fold consistent with the hypothesis that the vaccine sequesters fentanyl in the blood. Overall, these results support the continued development and evaluation of this fentanyl vaccine to address the ongoing opioid crisis.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIVaccine blunted fentanyl rate-suppression potency [~] 10-fold\\nC_LIO_LIVaccine blunted fentanyl antinociceptive potency [~]25-fold\\nC_LIO_LIFentanyl vaccine was as effective as acute 0.032 mg/kg naltrexone\\nC_LIO_LIVaccine was selective for fentanyl and not oxycodone\\nC_LIO_LIAntibody immune response [~] 3 nM affinity for fentanyl\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Microbes live in ever-changing environments where they need to adapt their metabolism to different nutrient conditions. Many studies have characterized the response of genetically identical cells to nutrient switches in homogenous cultures, however in nature microbes often live in spatially structured groups such as biofilms where cells can create metabolic gradients by consuming and releasing nutrients. Consequently, cells experience different local microenvironments and vary in their phenotype. How does this phenotypic variation affect the ability of cells to cope with nutrient switches? Here we address this question by growing dense populations of Escherichia coli in microfluidic chambers and studying a switch from glucose to acetate at the single cell level. Before the switch, cells vary in their metabolic activity: some grow on glucose while others cross-feed on acetate. After the switch, only few cells can resume growth after a period of lag. The probability to resume growth depends on a cells phenotype prior to the switch: it is highest for cells crossfeeding on acetate, while it depends in a non-monotonic way on growth rate for cells growing on glucose. Our results suggest that the strong phenotypic variation in spatially structured populations might enhance their ability to cope with fluctuating environments.",

    "abstract": "Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) has become a commonly-used tool for generating remotely-sensed forest inventories. However, LiDAR-derived forest inventories have remained uncommon at a regional scale due to varying parameters between LiDAR datasets, such as pulse density. Here we develop a regional model using a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN), a form of deep learning capable of scanning a LiDAR point cloud as well as coincident satellite data, identifying features useful for predicting forest attributes, and then making a series of predictions. We compare this to the standard modeling approach for making forest predictions from LiDAR data, and find that the CNN outperformed the standard approach by a large margin in many cases. We then apply our model to publicly available data over New England, generating maps of fourteen forest attributes at a 10 m resolution over 85 % of the region. Our estimates of attributes that quantified tree size were most successful. In assessing aboveground biomass for example, we achieved a root mean square error of 36 Mg/ha (44 %). Our county-level mapped estimates of biomass were in good agreement with federal estimates. Estimates of attributes quantifying stem density and percent conifer were moderately successful, with a tendency to underestimate of extreme values and banding in low density LiDAR acquisitions. Estimate of attributes quantifying detailed species groupings were less successful. Ultimately we believe these maps will be useful to forest managers, wildlife ecologists, and climate modelers in the region.",

    "abstract": "The disruption of the serotonergic (5HT) system has been implicated in causing major depression and the standard view is that a lack of serotonin is to blame for the resulting symptoms. Consequently, pharmacological interventions aim to increase serotonin concentration in its target areas or stimulating excitatory 5HT receptors. A standard approach is to use serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) which cause a higher accumulation of serotonin. Another approach is to stimulate excitatory serotonin receptors with psychedelic drugs. This paper compares these two approaches by first setting up a system level limbic system model of the relevant brain areas and then modelling a delayed reward paradigm which is known to be disrupted by a lack of 5HT. Central to our model is how serotonin changes the response characteristics of decision making neurons where low levels of 5HT allows small signals to pass through whereas high levels of 5HT create a barrier for smaller signals but amplifying larger ones. We show with both standard behavioural simulations and model checking that SSRIs perform significantly better against interventions with psychedelics. However, psychedelics might work better in other paradigms where a high level of exploration is beneficial to obtain rewards.",

The role of mTORC1 is well-characterized in excitatory principal cells but remains largely unaddressed in inhibitory interneurons. Here we used cell type-specific conditional knockout strategies to alter mTORC1 function selectively in somatostatin (SOM) inhibitory interneurons (SOM-INs). We found that up- and down-regulation of SOM-IN mTORC1 activity bi-directionally regulates contextual fear and spatial memory consolidation. Moreover, contextual fear learning induced a metabotropic glutamate receptor type 1 (mGluR1) mediated long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory input synapses onto hippocampal SOM-INs, that was dependent on mTORC1. Finally, the induction protocol for mTORC1-mediated late-LTP in SOM-INs regulated Schaffer collateral pathway LTP in pyramidal neurons. Thus, mTORC1 activity in somatostatin interneurons contributes to learning-induced persistent plasticity of their excitatory synaptic inputs and hippocampal memory consolidation, uncovering a role of mTORC1 in inhibitory circuits for memory.",

Like the Membrane Attack Complex and perforin, MPEG-1 has been postulated to form pores in target membranes, however, its mode of action remains to be established. We used single particle cryo-Electron Microscopy to determine the 2.4 [A] structure of a hexadecameric assembly of MPEG-1 that displays the expected features of a soluble pre-pore complex. We further discovered that the MPEG-1 pre-pore-like assemblies can be induced to perforate membranes through mild acidification, such as would occur within maturing phagolysosomes. We next solved the 3.6 [A] cryo-EM structure of MPEG-1 in complex with liposomes. Remarkably these data revealed that a C-terminal Multi-vesicular body of 12 kDa (MVB12)-associated {beta}-prism (MABP) domain interacts with target membranes in a mode that positions the pore forming machinery of MPEG-1 to point away from the bound membrane. This unexpected mechanism of membrane interaction raises the intriguing possibility that MPEG-1 may be able to remain bound to the phagolysosome membrane while simultaneously forming pores in engulfed bacterial targets.",

Platelet function through surface receptor activation was examined in healthy subjects, in patients with MI, and in age- and strain-matched mice before and after MI. Multivariate regression analyses revealed clinical variables associated with platelet receptor sensitivity at the time of MI.\\n\\nRESULTSPlatelets from healthy women are dose-dependently more active compared to men, particularly through the platelet thromboxane signaling pathway (7.8-fold increase in women vs. 3.0-fold in men, P=0.02). At the time of MI, platelet activation through surface protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) was less in women than men (3.5-fold vs. 8.5-fold, respectively, P=0.0001). Multivariate regression analyses revealed male sex (P=0.04) and NSTEMI (P=0.003) as independent predictors of enhanced platelet PAR1 signaling at the time of MI. Similar to humans, healthy female mice showed preferential thrombin-mediated platelet activation compared to male mice (8.7-fold vs. 4.8-fold, respectively; P<0.001). In the immediate post-MI environment, male mice showed preferential thrombin-mediated platelet activation compared to female mice (12.4-fold vs. 5.5-fold, respectively; P<0.001).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSThese results outline a previously unrecognized sex-dependent platelet phenotype where inhibition of thrombin signaling in the peri-MI environment--particularly in males--may be an important consideration.\\n\\nCONDENSED ABSTRACTPreclinical studies evaluating anti-platelet drugs are generally conducted in platelets isolated from healthy individuals. Growing evidence suggests changes in platelet signaling properties in certain disease conditions compared to healthy platelets may alter the response to anti-platelet medications. This investigation revealed that platelets from men and women who are healthy and following MI signal differently, particularly through thromboxane and PAR1 receptors. This effect was especially noted in patients with NSTEMI compared to STEMI. These observations raise the possibility of considering a sex-specific anti-platelet regimen for males and females in atheroembolic vascular diseases such as NSTEMI.",

    "abstract": "Metabarcoding is often presented as an alternative identification tool to compensate for coarse taxonomic resolution and misidentification encountered with traditional morphological approaches. However, metabarcoding comes with two major impediments which slow down its adoption. First, the picking and destruction of organisms for DNA extraction are time and cost consuming and do not allow organism conservation for further evaluations. Second, current metabarcoding protocols include a PCR enrichment step which induces errors in the estimation of species diversity and relative biomasses. In this study, we first evaluated the capacity of capture enrichment to replace PCR enrichment using controlled freshwater macrozoobenthos mock communities. Then, we tested if DNA extracted from the fixative ethanol (etDNA) of the same mock communities can be used as an alternative to DNA extracted from pools of whole organisms (bulk DNA). We show that capture enrichment provides more reliable and accurate representation of species occurrences and relative biomasses in comparison with PCR enrichment for bulk DNA. While etDNA does not permit to estimate relative biomasses, etDNA and bulk DNA provide equivalent species detection rates. Thanks to its robustness to mismatches, capture enrichment is already an efficient alternative to PCR enrichment for metabarcoding and, if coupled to etDNA, is a time-saver option in studies where presence information only is sufficient.",

    "abstract": "The human brain, as a finely-tuned system, needs a constant flow of oxygen to function properly. To accomplish this, the cerebrovascular system ensures a steady stream of oxygenation to brain cells. One tool that the cerebrovascular system uses is cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), which is the systems ability to react to vasoactive stimuli. Understanding CVR can provide unique information about cerebrovascular diseases and general brain function. CVR can be evaluated by scanning subjects with blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while they periodically inhale room air and CO2-enriched gas, a powerful and widely-used vasodilator. Our goal is to understand the effect of vasodilation on individual intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs), as well as how functional network connectivity (FNC) adapts to the same vasodilation. To achieve this goal, we first developed an innovative metric to measure the effect of CVR on ICNs, which contrasts to the commonly used voxel-wise CVR. Furthermore, for the first time, we studied static (sFNC) and dynamic (dFNC) FNC in the context of CVR. Our results show that network connectivity is generally weaker during vascular dilation, and these results are more pronounced in dFNC analysis. dFNC analysis reveals that participants did not return to the pre-CO2 inhalation state, suggesting that the one-minute period of room-air inhalation is not enough for the CO2 effect to fully dissipate in humans. Overall, we see new relationships between CVR and ICNs, as well as how FNC adapts to vascular system changes.",

    "abstract": "Dissection of the genetic basis of ionome is crucial for the understanding of the physiological and biochemical processes underlying mineral accumulation in seeds, as well as for efficient crop breeding. Most of the elements essential for plants are metals stored in seeds as chelate complexes with phytic acid or sulfur-containing compounds. We assume that the involvement of phosphorus and sulfur in metal chelation is the reason for strong phenotypic associations within ionome. Thus, we adjusted element concentrations for the effect of variation in phosphorus and sulfur seed content. The genetic architecture of wheat grain ionome was characterize by QTL analysis using a cross between durum and wild emmer wheat. Adjustment for variation in P and S drastically changed phenotypic associations within ionome and considerably improved QTL detection power and accuracy, resulting in identification of 105 QTLs and 437 QTL effects for 11 elements. A search for candidate genes revealed some strong functional associations of genes involved in transport and metabolism of ions and elements. Thus, we have shown that accounting for variation in P and S is crucial for understanding of the physiological and genetic regulation of mineral composition of wheat grain ionome and can be implemented for other plants.",

    "abstract": "Initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in early compared with chronic HIV infection is associated with a smaller HIV reservoir. This longitudinal analysis of 63 individuals who commenced ART during primary HIV infection (PHI) investigates which pre-and post-therapy factors associate most closely with reservoir size (HIV DNA) following treatment initiation during PHI. The best predictor of reservoir size at one-year was pre-ART HIV DNA which was in turn significantly associated with CD8 memory differentiation (effector memory, naive and T-betnegEomesneg subsets), CD8 T cell activation (CD38 expression) and PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on memory CD4 T cells. No associations were found for any immunological variables following one-year of ART. HIV reservoir size is determined around the time of ART initiation in individuals treated during PHI. CD8 T cell activation and memory expansion are linked to HIV reservoir size, suggesting the importance of the initial host-viral interplay in eventual reservoir size.",

Despite their singular phylogenetic position at the base of the eukaryotic tree of life, the morphology of these bewildering organisms remains a mystery. In order to visualize this elusive group, we applied a combination of CARD-FISH and epifluorescence microscopy on coastal hypersaline sediment samples, using specifically designed CARD-FISH probes for Heimdallarchaeia and Lokiarchaeia lineages and provide the first visual evidence for both these groups. Here, we show that while Heimdallarchaeia are characterized by a uniform cellular morphology typified by central DNA localization, Lokiarchaeia display a plethora of shapes and sizes that likely reflect their broad phylogenetic diversity and ecological distribution.",

    "abstract": "Histological atlases of the cerebral cortex, such as those made famous by Brodmann and von Economo, are invaluable for understanding human brain microstructure and its relationship with functional organization in the brain. However, these existing atlases are limited to small numbers of manually annotated samples from a single cerebral hemisphere, measured from 2D histological sections. We present the first whole-brain quantitative 3D laminar atlas of the human cerebral cortex. This atlas was derived from a 3D histological model of the human brain at 20 micron isotropic resolution (BigBrain), using a convolutional neural network to segment, automatically, the cortical layers in both hemispheres. Our approach overcomes many of the historical challenges with measurement of histological thickness in 2D and the resultant laminar atlas provides an unprecedented level of precision and detail.\n\nWe utilized this BigBrain cortical atlas to test whether previously reported thickness gradients, as measured by MRI in sensory and motor processing cortices, were present in a histological atlas of cortical thickness, and which cortical layers were contributing to these gradients. Cortical thickness increased across sensory processing hierarchies, primarily driven by layers III, V and VI. In contrast, fronto-motor cortices showed the opposite pattern, with decreases in total and pyramidal layer thickness. These findings illustrate how this laminar atlas will provide a link between single-neuron morphology, mesoscale cortical layering, macroscopic cortical thickness and, ultimately, functional neuroanatomy.",
