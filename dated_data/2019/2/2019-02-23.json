    "abstract": "The emergence of multicellularity requires the coexistence of diverse cellular populations displaying cooperative relationships. This enables long-term persistence of cellular consortia, particularly under environmental constraints that challenge cell survival. Toxic environments are known to trigger the formation of multicellular consortia capable of dealing with waste while promoting cell diversity as a way to overcome selection barriers. In this context, recent theoretical studies suggest that an environment containing both resources and toxic waste can promote the emergence of complex, spatially distributed proto-organisms exhibiting division of labor and higher-scale features beyond the cell-cell pairwise interactions. Some previous non-spatial models suggest that the presence of a growth inhibitor can trigger the coexistence of competitive species in an antibiotic-resistance context. In this paper we further explore this idea using both mathematical and computational models taking the most fundamental features of the proto-organisms interactions. It is shown that this resource-waste environmental context, in which both species are lethally affected by the toxic waste and metabolic tradeoffs are present, favours the maintenance of diverse populations. A spatial, stochastic extension confirms our basic results. The evolutionary and ecological implications of these results are outlined.",

    "abstract": "Alternative Splicing produces multiple mRNA isoforms of genes which have important diverse roles such as regulation of gene expression, human heritable diseases, and response to environmental stresses. However, little has been done to assign functions at the mRNA isoform level. Functional networks, where the interactions are quantified by their probability of being involved in the same biological process are typically generated at the gene level. We use a diverse array of tissue-specific RNA-seq datasets and sequence information to train random forest models that predict the functional networks. Since there is no mRNA isoform-level gold standard, we use single isoform genes co-annotated to Gene Ontology biological process annotations, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways, BioCyc pathways and protein-protein interactions as functionally related (positive pair). To generate the non-functional pairs (negative pair), we use the Gene Ontology annotations tagged with \"NOT\" qualifier. We describe 17 Tissue-spEcific mrNa iSoform functIOnal Networks (TENSION) following a leave-one-tissue-out strategy in addition to an organism level reference functional network for mouse. We validate our predictions by comparing its performance with previous methods, randomized positive and negative class labels, updated Gene Ontology annotations, and by literature evidence. We demonstrate the ability of our networks to reveal tissue-specific functional differences of the isoforms of the same genes.",

    "abstract": "Many Candida species that cause infection have diploid genomes, and do not undergo classical meiosis. The application of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing systems have therefore greatly facilitated the generation of gene disruptions, and the introduction of specific polymorphisms. However, CRISPR methods are not yet available for all Candida species. We describe here an adaption of a previously developed CRISPR system in Candida parapsilosis that uses an autonomously replicating plasmid. Guide RNAs can be introduced in a single cloning step, and are released by cleavage between a tRNA and a ribozyme. The plasmid also contains CAS9 and a selectable nourseothricin SAT1 marker. It can be used for markerless editing in C. parapsilosis, C. orthopsilosis and C. metapsilosis. We also show that CRISPR can easily be used to introduce molecular barcodes, and to reintroduce wild type sequences into edited strains. Heterozygous mutations can be generated, either by careful selection of the distance between the polymorphism and the Cas9 cut site, or by providing two different repair templates at the same time. In addition, we have constructed a different autonomously replicating plasmid for CRISPR-Cas9 editing in Candida tropicalis. We show that editing can easily be carried out in multiple C. tropicalis isolates. NHEJ repair occurs at a high level in C. metapsilosis and C. tropicalis.\n\nIMPORTANCECandida species are a major cause of infection worldwide. The species associated with infection vary with geographical location, and patient population. Infection with Candida tropicalis is particularly common in South America and Asia, and Candida parapsilosis infections are more common in the very young. Molecular methods for manipulating the genomes of these species are still lacking. We describe a simple and efficient CRISPR-based gene editing system that can be applied in the C. parapsilosis species group, including the sister species Candida orthopsilosis and Candida metapsilosis. We have also constructed a separate system for gene editing in C. tropicalis.",

    "abstract": "Acinetobacter baumannii, an opportunistic gram negative bacterium, is known to emerge as a major health threat in Eastern Africa. Clinical isolates exhibit resistance to carbapenems and most or all available antibiotics. This review is intended to present concerns about resistance and therapeutic challenges of multi drug resistance Acinetobacter baumannii in Eastern Africa. Data was obtained from PubMed and Google scholar, and from free goggle access and web Medline for facts about Acinetobacter baumannii and its resistance pattern. Moreover, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) flow chart was used to guide the selection of study materials. Total of 98 articles identified, 13 fit the criteria and were included for the final analysis. In East Africa the overall prevalence of Acinetobacter baumannii was 4.95%, while the overall rate of multi drug resistance, carbapenem and pan resistance was 87.3%, 64.8% and 25.2% respectively. Colistin resurges as potential therapeutic options to overcome the lack of new antibiotic treatment of Acinetobacter baumannii. There needs a collaborative effort in researches targeted for Acinetobacter baumannii treatment and respond for call of \"Research and Development of new antibiotics\" to control its damning impact.",

    "abstract": "The thermodimorphic pathogenic fungi Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and Paracoccioidioides lutzii are the etiologic causes of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), the most prevalent systemic mycosis in Latin America. Galectin-3 (Gal-3), an animal {beta}-galactoside-binding protein, modulates important roles during microbial infections, such as triggering a Th2-polarized immune response in PCM. Herein, we demonstrate that Gal-3 also plays other important roles in P. brasiliensis infection. We verified Gal-3 levels are upregulated in human and mice infections and establish that Gal-3 inhibits P. brasiliensis growth by inhibiting budding. Furthermore, Gal-3 affects disruption and internalization of extracellular vesicles (EV) from P. brasiliensis by macrophages. Our results suggest important roles for Gal-3 in P. brasiliensis infection, indicating that increased Gal-3 production during P. brasiliensis infection may account for affecting the fungal growth and EV stability, promoting a benefic course of experimental PCM.\n\nIMPORTANCEParacoccidiodomycosis (PCM) is the most prevalent systemic mycosis in Latin America. Although the immune mechanisms to control PCM are still not fully understood, several events of the host innate and adaptive immunity are crucial to determine the progress of the infection. Mammalian {beta}-galactoside-binding protein Galectin-3 (Gal-3) plays significant roles during microbial infections, and has been studied for its immunomodulatory roles but it can also have direct antimicrobial effects. We asked whether this protein plays a role in P. brasiliensis. We report herein that Gal-3 indeed has direct effects on fungal pathogen, inhibiting fungal growth and reducing extracellular vesicles stability. Our results suggest a direct role for Gal-3 in P. brasiliensis infection, with beneficial effects for the mammalian host.",

    "abstract": "In cancer tumors, lactate accumulation was initially attributed to high glucose consumption associated with the Warburg Effect. Now it is evident that lactate can also serve as an energy source in cancer cell metabolism. Additionally, lactate has been shown to promote metastasis, generate gene expression patterns in cancer cells consistent with \"cancer stem cell\" phenotypes, and result in treatment resistant tumors. Therefore, the goal of this work was to quantify the impact of lactate on metabolism in three breast cell lines (one normal and two breast cancer cell lines - MCF 10A, MCF7, and MDA-MB-231), in order to better understand the role lactate may have in different disease cell types. Parallel labeling metabolic flux analysis (13C-MFA) was used to quantify the intracellular fluxes under normal and high extracellular lactate culture conditions. Additionally, high extracellular lactate cultures were labelled in parallel with [U-13C] lactate, which provided qualitative information regarding the lactate uptake and metabolism. The 13C-MFA model, which incorporated the measured extracellular fluxes and the parallel labeling mass isotopomer distributions (MIDs) for five glycolysis, four tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), and three intracellular amino acid metabolites, predicted lower glycolysis fluxes in the high lactate cultures. All three cell lines experienced increased reductive carboxylation of glutamine to citrate in the TCA cycle as a result of high extracellular lactate. Increased reductive carboxylation previously has been observed under hypoxia and other mitochondrial stresses, whereas these cultures were grown aerobically. In addition, this is the first study to investigate the intracellular metabolic responses of different stages of breast cancer progression to high lactate exposure. These results provide insight into the role lactate accumulation has on metabolic reaction distributions in the different disease cell types while the cells are still proliferating in lactate concentrations that do not significantly decrease exponential growth rates.",
