    "abstract": "BackgroundLiving in a sanitary environment and taking Western-style diet in early life are both risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease and important factors for shaping host gut microbiota. Here, we aimed to establish whether different dietary composition fed during the early period after weaning would associate the susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis with different gut microbiota shifts.\n\nMethodsEighty weaned Balb/c mice were fed with high sugar, fat, protein, fiber, and standard diet for 8weeks respectively. Inflammation was induced by administration of 2.5% (wt/vol) dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for 7 days, and the microbiota characterized by 16s rRNA based pyrosequencing. Analyzed the inflammatory factors and toll-like receptors by Real-time PCR\n\nResultsThe high protein and high fiber+protein group exacerbated severity of DSS-induced colitis, the high fiber and high protein+fiber groups had the effect of reducing colitis, and the high sugar, fat and standard group show the similar disease phenotype of colitis. The diversity and richness of the microflora were significantly decreased in the high fiber group, while only decreased richness of flora was observed in the high protein group. The abundance of Firmicutes was decreased and the abundance of Bacteroides was increased in the high fat, high sugar, high protein and high fiber groups, especially in the high protein and high fiber group. The microbial community structure was slightly different at the species/genus level. The microbial community structure of high protein-fiber group and high fiber-protein group was still similar.\n\nConclusionsMice were fed with different dietary compositions of high sugar, fat, protein and fiber diets since weaning, and similar gut microbiota of high-abundance Bacteroides and low-abundance Firmicutes are formed in adult mice. These microbiota do not cause colonic mucosal damage directly. Only high protein diet aggravated DSS-induced colitis, while high fiber diet alleviated the colitis.",

    "abstract": "The genus Lactobacillus is known to be extremely diverse and consists of different phylogenetic groups that show a diversity roughly equal to the expected diversity of a typical bacterial genus. One of the most prominent phylogenetic groups within this genus is the Lactobacillus plantarum group which contains the understudied Lactobacillus mudanjiangensis species. Before this study, only one L. mudanjiangensis strain, DSM 28402T, was described but without whole-genome analysis. In this study, three strains classified as L. mudanjiangensis, were isolated from three different carrot juice fermentations and their whole-genome sequence was determined, together with the genome sequence of the type strain. The genomes of all four strains were compared with publicly available L. plantarum group genome sequences. This analysis showed that L. mudanjiangensis harbored the second largest genome size and gene count of the whole L. plantarum group. In addition, all members of this species showed the presence of a gene coding for a putative cellulose-degrading enzyme. Finally, three of the four L. mudanjiangensis strains studied showed the presence of pili on scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, which were linked to conjugative gene regions, coded on plasmids in at least two of the strains studied.\n\nAuthor summaryLactobacillus mudanjiangensis is an understudied species within the Lactobacillus plantarum group. Since its first description, no other studies have reported its isolation. Here, we present the first four genome sequences of this species, which include the genome sequence of the type strain and three new L. mudanjiangensis strains isolated from fermented carrot juice. The genomes of all four strains were compared with publicly available L. plantarum group genome sequences. We found that this species harbored the second largest genome size and gene count of the whole L. plantarum group. Furthermore, we present the first scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of L. mudanjiangensis, which showed the formation of pili in three strains that we linked to genes related to conjugation. Finally, we found the presence of a unique putative cellulose-degrading enzyme, opening the door for different industrial applications of these Lactobacillus strains.",

    "abstract": "A central issue in the study of the neural generation of respiratory rhythms is the role of the intrinsic pacemaking capabilities that some respiratory neurons exhibit. The debate on this issue has occurred in parallel to investigations of interactions among respiratory network neurons and how these contribute to respiratory behavior. In this computational study, we demonstrate how these two issues are inextricably linked. We use simulations and dynamical systems analysis to show that once a conditional respiratory pacemaker, which can be tuned across oscillatory and non-oscillatory dynamic regimes in isolation, is embedded into a respiratory network, its dynamics become masked: the network exhibits similar dynamic properties regardless of the conditional pacemaker nodes tuning, and that nodes outputs are dominated by network influences. Furthermore, the outputs of the respiratory central pattern generator as a whole are invariant to these changes of dynamical properties, which ensures flexible and robust performance over a wide dynamic range.\n\nAuthor summaryBreathing movements in mammals are generated by brainstem respiratory central pattern generator (CPG) networks, which incorporate an excitatory oscillator located in the pre-Botzinger Complex (preBotC) that can exhibit autorhythmic behavior. To understand how these autorhythmic properties impact CPG network dynamical performance, we performed computational studies with an established modeling framework to systematically analyze network behavior when the preBotC excitatory neurons intrinsic dynamics are tuned to operate in autorhythmic versus non-autorhythmic regimes. Both of these regimes enable rhythmic activity of the CPG network, and we show that the rhythm and its responses to various manipulations are preserved across the tunings of intrinsic properties of the preBotC component. Correspondingly, the emergence of behaviorally appropriate rhythmic patterns of network activity is maintained across preBotC regimes, accompanied by an expansion of the ranges of network output frequencies and amplitudes beyond those attainable with either preBotC regime alone. These results lead to the novel conclusion and concept that the dynamical operation of the CPG is functionally highly robust with respect to the rhythmogenic state of the preBotC excitatory circuits, which could represent a key property for preserved respiratory function across varying conditions and demands on network performance.",

    "abstract": "Strongyloidiasis is caused by the human infective nematodes Strongyloides stercoralis, Strongyloides fuelleborni subsp. fuelleborni and Strongyloides fuelleborni subsp. kellyi. The zoonotic potential of S. stercoralis and the potential role of dogs in the maintenance of strongyloidiasis transmission has been a topic of interest and discussion for many years. In Australia, strongyloidiasis is prevalent in remote socioeconomically disadvantaged communities in the north of the continent. Being an isolated continent that has been separated from other regions for a long geological period, description of the diversity of Australian Strongyloides genotypes adds to our understanding of the genetic diversity within the genus. Using PCR enrichment combined with Illumina sequencing technology, we sequenced the Strongyloides SSU 18S rDNA hyper-variable I and hyper-variable IV regions using Strongyloides-specific primers, and a fragment of the mtDNA cox1 gene using primers that are broadly specific for Strongyloides sp. and hookworms. These loci were amplified from DNA extracted from Australian human and dog faeces, and one human sputum sample. Using this approach, we confirm for the first time that potentially zoonotic S. stercoralis genotypes are present in Australia, suggesting that dogs represent a potential reservoir of human strongyloidiasis in remote Australian communities.\n\nAuthor summaryStrongyloides stercoralis is a soil-transmitted nematode that causes the disease strongyloidiasis. Due to the autoinfective nature of this parasite, it can re-infect a host causing chronic infection. If not diagnosed and treated it can be highly detrimental to human health and has a high mortality rate. Strongyloidiasis is common in remote communities in the north of Australia and has been an issue for decades. Despite various successful intervention programs to treat human strongyloidiasis, the disease remains endemic in those communities. Here for the first time we looked at the Australian dogs potential to infect humans and found that they carry two genetically distinct strains of Strongyloides spp., one of which also infects humans. This supports the hypothesis that dogs are a potential source for human strongyloidiasis. We also found that dogs in Australia might be carrying unique haplotypes. Whether these new haplotypes are also human infective is to be confirmed by further research.",

    "abstract": "Teleost fishes, thanks to their rapid evolution of sex determination mechanisms, provide remarkable opportunities to study the formation of sex chromosomes and the mechanisms driving the birth of new master sex determining (MSD) genes. However, the evolutionary interplay between the sex chromosomes and the MSD genes they harbor is rather unexplored. We characterized a male-specific duplicate of the anti-Mullerian hormone (amh) as the MSD gene in Northern Pike (Esox lucius), using genomic and expression evidences as well as by loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments. Using RAD-Sequencing from a family panel, we identified Linkage Group (LG) 24 as the sex chromosome and positioned the sex locus in its sub-telomeric region. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this MSD originated from an ancient duplication of the autosomal amh gene, which was subsequently translocated to LG24. Using sex-specific pooled genome sequencing and a new male genome sequence assembled using Nanopore long reads, we also characterized the differentiation of the X and Y chromosomes, revealing a small male-specific insertion containing the MSD gene and a limited region with reduced recombination. Our study depicts an unexpected level of limited differentiation within a pair of sex chromosomes harboring an old MSD gene in a wild population of teleost fish, highlights the pivotal role of genes from the amh pathway in sex determination, as well as the importance of gene duplication as a mechanism driving the turnover of sex chromosomes in this clade.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn stark contrast to mammals and birds, teleosts have predominantly homomorphic sex chromosomes and display a high diversity of sex determining genes. Yet, population level knowledge of both the sex chromosome and the master sex determining gene is only available for the Japanese medaka, a model species. Here we identified and provided functional proofs of an old duplicate of anti-Mullerian hormone (Amh), a member of the Tgf-{beta} family, as the male master sex determining gene in the Northern pike, Esox lucius. We found that this duplicate, named amhby (Y-chromosome-specific anti-Mullerian hormone paralog b), was translocated to the sub-telomeric region of the new sex chromosome, and now amhby shows strong sequence divergence as well as substantial expression pattern differences from its autosomal paralog, amha. We assembled a male genome sequence using Nanopore long reads and identified a restricted region of differentiation within the sex chromosome pair in a wild population. Our results provide insight on the conserved players in sex determination pathways, the mechanisms of sex chromosome turnover, and the diversity of levels of differentiation between homomorphic sex chromosomes in teleosts.",

    "abstract": "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are currently approving Medicaid demonstration projects involving work and community engagement requirements. The fear among public health professionals and policymakers is that these work requirements will disproportionately limit access to health insurance for African-Americans. To investigate these new work requirements for Medicaid, we conducted a systematic review of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, the last major welfare program to have such work requirements. We used the ProQuest database and selected scholarly journal studies in English and published between January 1991-August 2018. Our selection strategy yielded 14 eligible studies, eight of which focused on caseload movements and six focused on sanctions. We found that African-Americans entered TANF at a higher rate than Whites, remained on TANF longer, and were subject to sanctions more frequently and stringently than Whites were. These results suggest that African-Americans may disproportionately experience reduced access to care through sanctioning such as lockout periods. Recommended policy changes include prohibiting work activities as a condition of Medicaid coverage, strengthening Medicaid in other ways, combating discriminatory hiring practices, and easing burdensome reporting requirements.",

    "abstract": "Control of astrocytes via modulation of Ca2+ oscillations using techniques like optogenetics can prove to be crucial in therapeutic intervention of a variety of neurological disorders. However, a systematic study quantifying the effect of optogenetic stimulation in astrocytes is yet to be performed. Here, we propose a novel stochastic Ca2+dynamics model that incorporates the light sensitive component - channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2). Utilizing this model, we studied the effect of various pulsed light stimulation paradigms on astrocytes for select variants of ChR2 (wild type, ChETA, and ChRET/TC) in both an individual and a network of cells. Our results exhibited a consistent pattern of Ca2+ activity among individual cells in response to optogenetic stimulation, i.e., showing steady state regimes with increased Ca2+ basal level and Ca2+ spiking probability. Furthermore, we performed a global sensitivity analysis to assess the effect of stochasticity and variation of model parameters on astrocytic Ca2+ dynamics in the presence and absence of light stimulation, respectively. Results indicated that directing variants towards the first open state of the photo-cycle of ChR2 (o1) enhances spiking activity in astrocytes during optical stimulation. Evaluation of the effect of astrocytic ChR2 expression (heterogeneity) on Ca2+ signaling revealed that the optimal stimulation paradigm of a network does not necessarily coincide with that of an individual cell. Simulation for ChETA-incorporated astrocytes suggest that maximal activity of a single cell reduced the spiking probability of the network of astrocytes at higher degrees of ChR2 expression efficiency due to an elevation of basal Ca2+ beyond physiological levels. Collectively, the framework presented in this study provides valuable information for the selection of light stimulation paradigms that elicit optimal astrocytic activity using existing ChR2 constructs, as well as aids in the engineering of future optogenetic constructs.\n\nAuthor summaryOptogenetics - an avant-garde technique involves targeted delivery of light sensitive ion channels to cells. Channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2), an algal derived light sensitive ion channel has extensively been used in neuroscience to manipulate various cell types in a guided and controlled manner. Despite being predominantly used in neurons, recent advancements have led to the expansion of the application of optogenetics in non-neuronal cell types, like astrocytes. These cells play a key role in various aspects of the central nervous system and alteration of their signaling is associated with various disorders, including epilepsy, stroke and Alzheimers disease. Hence, invaluable information for therapeutic intervention can be obtained from using optogenetics to regulate astrocytic activity in a strategic manner. Here, we propose a novel computational model to assess astrocytic response to optogenetic stimulation which implicitly accounts for the stochastic character of Ca2+ signaling in this cell type. We identified light stimulation paradigms suitable for eliciting astrocytic Ca2+ response within physiological levels in widely-used ChR2 variants and identified highly sensitive parameters in ChR2 kinetics conducive for higher probability in Ca2+ spiking. Overall, the results of this model can be used to boost astrocyte light-induced behavior prediction and the development of improved future optogenetic constructs.",

    "abstract": "In natural environments, mammals can efficiently select actions based on noisy sensory signals and quickly adapt to unexpected outcomes to better exploit opportunities that arise in the future. Such feedback-based changes in behavior rely on long term plasticity within cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamic networks, driven by dopaminergic modulation of cortical inputs to the direct and indirect pathway neurons of the striatum. While the firing rates of corticostriatal neurons have been shown to adapt across a range of feedback conditions, it remains difficult to directly assess the corticostriatal synaptic weight changes that contribute to these adaptive firing rates. In this work, we simulate a computational model for the evolution of corticostriatal synaptic weights based on a spike timing-dependent plasticity rule driven by dopamine signaling that is induced by outcomes of actions in the context of a two-alternative forced choice task. Results show that plasticity predominantly impacts direct pathway weights, which evolve to drive action selection toward a more-rewarded action in settings with deterministic reward outcomes. After the model is tuned based on such fixed reward scenarios, its performance agrees with the results of behavioral experiments carried out with probabilistic reward paradigms.",

The 96 Eyes acquires raw data at a rate of 0.7 frame per second (all wells) and the data are processed with 4 cores of graphical processing units (GPUs; GK210, Nvidia Tesla K80, USA).

    "abstract": "MotivationDiscovery of genetic variants by whole genome sequencing has proven a powerful approach to study the etiology of complex genetic disorders. Elucidation of all variants is a necessary step in identifying causative variants and disease genes. In particular, there is an increased interest in detection of de novo variation and investigation of its role in various disorders. State-of-the-art methods for variant discovery rely on mapping reads from each individual to a reference genome and predicting variants from difference observed between the mapped reads and the reference genome. This process typically results in millions of variant predictions, most of which are inherited and irrelevant to the phenotype of interest. To distinguish between inherited variation and novel variation resulting from de novo germline mutation, whole-genome sequencing of close relatives (especially parents and siblings) is commonly used. However, standard mapping-based approaches tend to have a high false-discovery rate for de novo variant prediction, which in many cases arises from problems with read mapping. This is a particular challenge in predicting de novo indels and structural variants.\n\nResultsWe have developed a mapping-free method, Kevlar, for de novo variant discovery based on direct comparison of sequence content between related individuals. Kevlar identifies high-abundance k-mers unique to the individual of interest and retrieves the reads containing these k-mers. These reads are easily partitioned into disjoint sets by shared k-mer content for subsequent locus-by-locus processing and variant calling. Kevlar also utilizes a novel probabilistic approach to score and rank the variant predictions to identify the most likely de novo variants. We evaluated Kevlar on simulated and real pedigrees, and demonstrate its ability to detect both de novo SNVs and indels with high sensitivity and specificity.\n\nAvailability: https://github.com/dib-lab/kevlar",

    "abstract": "The three-dimensional (3D) structure of the genome plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression. Chromatin conformation capture technologies (Hi-C) have revealed that the genome is organized in a hierarchy of topologically associated domains (TADs), the fundamental building blocks of the genome. Identifying such hierarchical structures is a critical step in understanding regulatory interactions within the genome. Existing tools for TAD calling frequently require tunable parameters, are sensitive to biases such as sequencing depth, resolution, and sparsity of Hi-C data, and are computationally inefficient. Furthermore, the choice of TAD callers within the R/Bioconductor ecosystem is limited. To address these challenges, we frame the problem of TAD detection in a spectral clustering framework. Our SpectralTAD R package has automatic parameter selection, robust to sequencing depth, resolution and sparsity of Hi-C data, and detects hierarchical, biologically relevant TAD structure. Using simulated and real-life Hi-C data, we show that SpectralTAD outperforms rGMAP and TopDom, two state-of-the-art R-based TAD callers. TAD boundaries that are shared among multiple levels of the hierarchy were more enriched in relevant genomic annotations, e.g., CTCF binding sites, suggesting their higher biological importance. In contrast, boundaries of primary TADs, defined as TADs which cannot be split into sub-TADs, were found to be less enriched in genomic annotations, suggesting their more dynamic role in genome regulation. In summary, we present a simple, fast, and user-friendly R package for robust detection of TAD hierarchies supported by biological evidence. SpectralTAD is available on https://github.com/dozmorovlab/SpectralTAD and Bioconductor (submitted).",

The non-equilibrium nature of this system presents considerable challenges to developing a general theory describing its behavior; however, studies have demonstrated that when studied at appropriate spatiotemporal scales, the behavior of ensembles of non-equilibrium systems can resemble that of system at equilibrium. Here we apply this principle to a population of cells within a cytomorphological state space and demonstrate that cellular transition dynamics within this space can be suitably described using equilibrium dynamics formalisms. We use this framework to map the effective energy landscape underlying the cytomorphological state space of a population of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and identify topographical non-uniformity in this space, indicating non-uniform occupation of cytomorphological states within an isogenic population. The introduction of exogenous apoptotic agents altered this energy landscape, inducing formation of additional energy minima that correlated directly with changes in sensitivity to apoptotic induction. The measured application of equilibrium dynamics formalism allows us to accurately capture and these findings suggest that though cells are complex non-equilibrium systems, the application of formalisms derived from equilibrium thermodynamics can provide insight into the basis of non-genetic heterogeneities as well as the relationship between morphological and functional heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "The microRNA MIR211 is an important regulator of melanoma tumor cell behavior. Previous studies suggested that in certain tumors, MIR211 acted as a tumor suppressor while in others it behaved as an oncogenic regulator. When MIR211 is expressed in BRAFV600E-mutant A375 melanoma cells in mouse xenografts, it promotes aggressive tumor growth accompanied by increased cellular proliferation and angiogenesis. We demonstrate that MIR211 is transferred to adjacent cells in the tumor micro-environment via exosomes. Cross-species genome-wide transcriptomic analysis showed that human tumor-derived MIR211 interacts with the mouse transcriptome in the tumor microenvironment, and activates ERK5 signaling in human tumor cells via the modulation of a feedback loop. Human miR211 directly inhibits human DUSP6 protein phosphatase at the post-transcriptional level. We provide support for the hypothesis that DUSP6 inhibition conferred resistance of the human tumor cells to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib and to the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib, with associated increases in ERK5 phosphorylation. These findings are consistent with a model in which MIR211 regulates melanoma tumor proliferation and BRAF inhibitor resistance by inducing ERK5 signaling within the complex tumor microenvironment. We propose that the MIR211-ERK5 axis represents an important and sensitive regulatory arm in melanoma with potential theranostic applications.",

We previously showed BCP-ALL cells display unique and clonally heritable DNA-replication timing (RT) programs; i.e., programs describing the variable order of replication of megabase-scale chromosomal units of DNA in different cell types. To determine the extent to which BCP-ALL RT programs mirror or deviate from specific stages of normal human B-cell differentiation, we transplanted immunodeficient mice with quiescent normal human CD34+ cord blood cells and obtained RT signatures of the regenerating B-lineage populations. We then compared these with RT signatures for leukemic cells from a large cohort of BCP-ALL patients. The results identify BCP-ALL subtype-specific features that resemble specific stages of B-cell differentiation and features that appear associated with relapse. These results suggest the genesis of BCP-ALL involves alterations in RT that reflect clinically relevant leukemia-specific genetic and/or epigenetic changes.\n\nSUMMARYGenome-wide DNA replication timing profiles of >100 pediatric leukemic samples and normally differentiating human B-lineage cells isolated from xenografted immunodeficient mice were generated.

    "abstract": "Rationale-Adult human cardiomyocytes (CMs) do not complete cytokinesis despite passing through the S-phase of the cell cycle. As a result polyploidization and multinucleation occur. In order to get a deeper understanding of the mechanisms surrounding division of CMs there is a crucial need for a technique to isolate CMs that complete cell division/cytokinesis.\n\nObjective-Markers of cell cycle progression based on DNA content cannot distinguish between mitotic CMs that fail to complete cytokinesis from those cells that undergo true cell division. With the use of molecular beacons (MB) targeting specific mRNAs we aimed to identify truly proliferative CMs derived from hiPSCs.\n\nMethods and Results-Fluorescence activated cell-sorting combined with molecular beacons was performed to sort CM populations enriched for mitotic cells. Expressions of cell-cycle specific genes were confirmed by means of RT-qPCR, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). We further characterized the sorted groups by proliferation assays and time-lapse microscopy which confirmed the proliferative advantage of MB-positive cell populations relative to MB-negative and G2/M populations. Gene expression analysis revealed that the MB-positive CM subpopulation exhibited patterns consistent with the biological processes of nuclear division, chromosome segregation, and transition from M to G1 phase. The use of dual-MBs targeting CDC20 and SPG20 mRNAs (CDC20+SPG20+) enabled the enrichment of cytokinetic events. Interestingly, cells that did not complete cytokinesis and remained binucleated were found to be CDC20-SPG20+ while polyploid CMs that replicated DNA but failed to complete karyokinesis were found to be CDC20-SPG20-.\n\nConclusions-This study demonstrates a novel alternative to existing DNA content-based approaches for sorting CMs with true mitotic potential that can be used to study in detail the unique dynamics of CM nuclei during mitosis. Together with high-throughput scRNA-seq, our technique for sorting live CMs undergoing cytokinesis would provide a basis for future studies to uncover mechanisms underlying the development and regeneration of heart tissue.",

Here, by using steady and live imaging approaches in mouse skin, we show that lymphatic capillaries distribute to the anterior permanent region of individual HF and interconnect neighboring HF at the level of the HF bulge, in a hair follicle stem cell (HFSC)-dependent manner. LV further connect individual HF in triads and dynamically flow across the skin. Interestingly, at the onset of the physiological HFSC activation, or upon pharmacological or genetic induction of HF growth, LV transiently expand their caliber suggesting an increased tissue drainage capacity. Interestingly, the physiological LV caliber increase is associated with a distinct gene expression correlated to ECM and cytoskeletal reorganization. Using mouse genetics, we show that the depletion of LV blocks the pharmacological induction of HF growth. Our findings define LV as components of the HFSC niche, coordinating HF connections at tissue-level, and provide insight into their functional contribution to HF regeneration.",

Historically, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has provided a powerful system for studying and identifying conserved regulators of BH3-only proteins. In C. elegans, the BH3-only protein EGL-1 is expressed during development to cell-autonomously trigger most developmental cell deaths. Here we provide evidence that egl-1 is also transcribed after development in the sensory neuron pair URX without inducing apoptosis. We used genetic screening and epistasis analysis to determine that its transcription is regulated in URX by neuronal activity and/or in parallel by orthologs of Protein Kinase G and the Salt-Inducible Kinase family. Because several BH3-only family proteins are also expressed in the adult nervous system of mammals, we suggest that studying egl-1 expression in URX may shed light on mechanisms that regulate conserved family members in higher organisms.",

Microinjection of an empirically determined amount of Gam1 mRNA into one-cell Xenopus embryos can reduce SUMOylation activity to undetectable, but nonlethal, levels, enabling an examination of the role of this post-translational modification during early vertebrate development.\n\nResultsWe find that SUMOylation-deficient embryos consistently exhibit defects in neural tube and heart development. We have measured differences in gene expression between control and embryos injected with Gam1 mRNA at three developmental stages: early gastrula (immediately following the initiation of zygotic transcription), late gastrula (completion of the formation of the three primary germ layers), and early neurula (appearance of the neural plate). Although changes in gene expression are widespread and can be linked to many biological processes, three pathways, non-canonical Wnt/PCP, snail/twist, and Ets-1, are especially sensitive to the loss of SUMOylation activity and can largely account for the predominant phenotypes of Gam1 embryos. SUMOylation appears to generate different pools of a given transcription factor having different specificities with this post-translational modification involved in the regulation of more complex, as opposed to housekeeping, processes.\n\nConclusionsWe have identified changes in gene expression that underlie the neural tube and heart phenotypes resulting from depressed SUMOylation activity. Notably, these developmental defects correspond to the two most frequently occurring congenital birth defects in humans, strongly suggesting that perturbation of SUMOylation, either globally or of a specific protein, may frequently be the origin of these pathologies.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A streptococcus, GAS) is an important human pathogen responsible for a wide variety of diseases from uncomplicated tonsillitis to life-threatening invasive infections. GAS secretes EndoS, an endoglycosidase able to specifically cleave the conserved N-glycan on human IgG antibodies. In vitro, removal of this glycan impairs IgG effector functions but its relevance to GAS infection in vivo is unclear. Using targeted mass spectrometry, we were able to characterize the effects of EndoS on host IgG glycosylation during the course of natural infections in human patients. We found substantial IgG glycan hydrolysis locally at site of infection as well as systemically in the most severe cases. Using these findings we were able to set up appropriate model systems to demonstrate decreased resistance to phagocytic killing of GAS lacking EndoS in vitro, as well as decreased virulence in a mouse model of invasive infection. This study represents the first described example of specific bacterial IgG glycan hydrolysis during infection and highlights the importance of IgG glycan hydrolysis for streptococcal pathogenesis. We thereby offer new insights into the mechanism of immune evasion employed by this pathogen with clear implications for treatment of severe GAS infections and future efforts at vaccine development.",

The blood-feeding behavior of Anopheles females delivers essential nutrients for egg development and drives transmission from one human host to another. Plasmodium growth is adapted to the vector reproductive cycle, but how changes in the reproductive cycle impact parasite development is poorly understood. Here, we show that the blood meal-induced miR-276-5p fine-tunes the duration of the mosquito reproductive cycle. Silencing of miR-276 prolonged amino acid catabolism and increased female fertility rates, suggesting that timely termination of the reproductive cycle restricts mosquito investment into reproduction. Prolongation of the reproductive period in P. falciparum-infected females compromised the development of the transmissible parasite form called sporozoite.

    "abstract": "Collective cell migration is fundamental for the development of organisms and in the adult, for tissue regeneration and in pathological conditions such as cancer. Migration as a coherent group requires the maintenance of cell-cell interactions, while contact-inhibition-of-locomotion (CIL), a local repulsive force, propels the group forward. Here we show that the cell-cell interaction molecule, N-cadherin, regulates both adhesion and repulsion processes during Schwann cell collective migration, which is required for peripheral nerve regeneration. However, distinct from its role in cell-cell adhesion, the repulsion process is independent of N-cadherin trans-homodimerisation and the associated adherens junction complex. Rather, the extracellular domain of N-cadherin acts to traffic a repulsive Slit2/Slit3 signal to the cell-surface. Inhibiting Slit2/Slit3 signalling inhibits CIL and subsequently collective SC migration, resulting in adherent, non-migratory cell clusters. These findings provide insight into how opposing signals can mediate collective cell migration and how CIL pathways are promising targets for inhibiting pathological cell migration.",

For all neurodegenerative conditions, we lack longitudinal gene expression (GE) data covering their large temporal evolution, which hinders the fully understanding of the underlying dynamic molecular mechanisms. Here, we aimed to overcome this limitation by introducing a novel GE contrastive trajectory inference (GE-cTI) method that reveals enriched temporal patterns in a diseased population. Evaluated on 1969 subjects in the spectrum of late-onset Alzheimers and Huntingtons diseases (from ROSMAP, HBTRC and ADNI studies), this unsupervised machine learning algorithm strongly predicts neuropathological severity (e.g. Braak, Amyloid and Vonsattel stages). Furthermore, when applied to in-vivo blood samples (ADNI), it predicts 97% of the variance in memory deterioration and its future declining rate, supporting the identification of a powerful and minimally invasive (blood-based) tool for early clinical screening and disease prevention. This technique also allows the discovery of genes and molecular pathways, in both peripheral and brain tissues, that are highly predictive of disease evolution. Eighty percent of the most predictive molecular pathways identified in the brain were also top predictors in the blood. The GE-cTI is a promising tool for revealing complex neuropathological mechanisms, with direct implications for implementing personalized dynamic treatments in neurology.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS- Unsupervised learning detects enriched gene expression (GE) trajectories in disease\n- These plasma and brain GE trajectories predict neuropathology and future cognitive impairment\n- Most predictive molecular functions/pathways in the brain are also top predictors in the plasma\n- By identifying plasma GE trajectories, patients can be easily screened and follow dynamic treatments",

Studies investigating this ability have repeatedly found that the simultaneous acquisition of different transformations appears inextricably tied to distinct states associated with movement, such as different postures or action plans, whereas abstract contextual associations can be leveraged by explicit aiming strategies. It still remains unclear how different transformations are remembered implicitly when target postures are similar. We investigated if features of planning to manipulate a visual tool, such as its visual identity or the intended effect enable implicit learning of opposing visuomotor rotations. Both cues only affected implicit aftereffects indirectly through generalization around explicit strategies. In contrast, practicing transformations with different hands resulted in separate aftereffects. It appears that different (intended) body states are necessary to separate aftereffects, supporting the idea that underlying implicit adaptation is limited to the recalibration of a body model.",

    "abstract": "Global signal regression (GSR) is one of the most debated preprocessing strategies for resting-state functional MRI. GSR effectively removes global artifacts driven by motion and respiration, but also discards globally distributed neural information and introduces negative correlations between certain brain regions. The vast majority of previous studies have focused on the effectiveness of GSR in removing imaging artifacts, as well as its potential biases. Given the growing interest in functional connectivity fingerprinting, here we considered the utilitarian question of whether GSR strengthens or weakens associations between resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and multiple behavioral measures across cognition, personality and emotion.\n\nBy applying the variance component model to the Brain Genomics Superstruct Project (GSP), we found that behavioral variance explained by whole-brain RSFC increased by an average of 47% across 23 behavioral measures after GSR. In the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we found that behavioral variance explained by whole-brain RSFC increased by an average of 40% across 58 behavioral measures, when GSR was applied after ICA-FIX de-noising. To ensure generalizability, we repeated our analyses using kernel regression. GSR improved behavioral prediction accuracies by an average of 64% and 12% in the GSP and HCP datasets respectively. Importantly, the results were consistent across methods. A behavioral measure with greater RSFC-explained variance (using the variance component model) also exhibited greater prediction accuracy (using kernel regression). A behavioral measure with greater improvement in behavioral variance explained after GSR (using the variance component model) also enjoyed greater improvement in prediction accuracy after GSR (using kernel regression). Furthermore, GSR appeared to benefit task performance measures more than self-reported measures.\n\nSince GSR was more effective at removing motion-related and respiratory-related artifacts, GSR-related increases in variance explained and prediction accuracies were unlikely the result of motion-related or respiratory-related artifacts. However, it is worth emphasizing that the current study focused on whole-brain RSFC, so it remains unclear whether GSR improves RSFC-behavioral associations for specific connections or networks. Overall, our results suggest that at least in the case for young healthy adults, GSR strengthens the associations between RSFC and most (although not all) behavioral measures.

Here by using sensory axon and optic nerve regeneration as model systems, we revealed an unexpected role of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) in regulation of axon regeneration. We also provided strong evidence that TERT and p53 acted downstream of c-Myc to control sensory axon regeneration. More importantly, overexpression of p53 in sensory neurons and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) was sufficient to promote sensory axon and optic never regeneration, respectively.

HEXOKINASE1 (HXK1), which is also implicated in seedling establishment, can operate as a glycolytic enzyme or as a glucose-activated sensor signalling molecule. Under light and nutrient limiting conditions, the HXK1 sensor-signalling has been shown to control hypocotyl elongation. Little is known of whether HXK1 glycolytic function, or HXK1 and PIF cross-talk, is required to control hypocotyl growth.\nC_LIO_LIWe demonstrate HXK1 glycolytic activity is critical for cell expansion, and hypocotyl growth, post-germination. Notably, application of glucose-6-phosphate, the HXK1 enzymatic product, can restore short gin2-1/hxk1-1 mutant hypocotyls to wild-type length. Further, HXK1 sensor-signalling complex components, VHA-B1 and RPT5B, do not contribute to this response, for unlike gin2-1/hxk1-1, the vha-B1 and rpt5b alleles only disrupt hypocotyl growth following exogenous glucose application.\nC_LIO_LImRNA-seq analysis illustrates that HXK1 and PIF signalling converge at genes with known roles in light signalling. HXK1 imposes strong regulation on chloroplast and mitochondrial encoded genes, also branched chain amino acid catabolism pathway genes, which can provide a source of respiratory substrates in starvation conditions.\nC_LIO_LIOur study establishes the importance of HXK1 enzymatic function in supporting cell expansion and hypocotyl growth.

    "abstract": "The dynamic translocation of transcription factors (TFs) in and out of the nucleus is thought to encode information, such as the identity of a stimulus. A corollary is the idea that gene promoters can decode different dynamic TF translocation patterns. Testing this TF encoding/promoter decoding hypothesis requires tools that allow direct control of TF dynamics without the pleiotropic effects associated with general perturbations. In this work, we present CLASP (Controllable Light Activated Shuttling and Plasma membrane sequestration), a tool that enables precise, modular, and reversible control of TF localization using a combination of two optimized LOV2 optogenetic constructs. The first sequesters the cargo in the dark at the plasma membrane and releases it upon exposure to blue light, while light exposure of the second reveals a nuclear localization sequence that shuttles the released cargo to the nucleus. CLASP achieves minute-level resolution, reversible translocation of many TF cargos, large dynamic range, and tunable target gene expression. Using CLASP, we investigate the relationship between Crz1, a naturally pulsatile TF, and its cognate promoters. We establish that some Crz1 target genes respond more efficiently to pulsatile TF inputs than to continuous inputs, while others exhibit the opposite behavior. We show using computational modeling that efficient gene expression in response to short pulsing requires fast promoter activation and slow inactivation and that the opposite phenotype can ensue from a multi-stage promoter activation, where a transition in the first stage is thresholded. These data directly demonstrate differential interpretation of TF pulsing dynamics by different genes, and provide plausible models that can achieve these phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) encode information in both their primary sequence and their higher order structure. The independent contributions of factors like codon usage and secondary structure to regulating protein expression are difficult to establish as they are often highly correlated in endogenous sequences. Here, we used two approaches, global inclusion of modified nucleotides and rational sequence design of exogenously delivered constructs to understand the role of mRNA secondary structure independent from codon usage. Unexpectedly, highly-expressed mRNAs contained a highly-structured coding sequence (CDS). Modified nucleotides that stabilize mRNA secondary structure enabled high expression across a wide-variety of primary sequences. Using a set of eGFP mRNAs that independently altered codon usage and CDS structure, we find that the structure of the CDS regulates protein expression through changes in functional mRNA half-life (i.e. mRNA being actively translated).

    "abstract": "A wealth of experimental data relating to the emergence of collective cell migration as one proceeds from the behavioral dynamics of small cohorts of cells to the coordinated migratory response of cells in extended tissues is now available. Integrating these findings into a mechanistic picture of cell migration that is applicable across such a broad range of system sizes constitutes a crucial step towards a better understanding of the basic factors that determine the emergence of collective cell motion. Here we present a cellular-automaton-based modeling framework, which focuses on the integration of high-level cell functions and their concerted effect on cellular migration patterns. In particular, we adopt a top-down approach to incorporate a coarse-grained description of cell polarity and its response to mechanical cues, and address the impact of cell adhesion on collective migration in cell groups. We demonstrate that the model faithfully reproduces typical cell shapes and movements down to the level of single cells, yet is computationally efficient enough to allow for the simulation of (currently) up to [O](104) cells. To develop a mechanistic picture that illuminates the relationship between cell functions and collective migration, we present a detailed study of small groups of cells in confined circular geometries, and discuss the emerging patterns of collective motion in terms of specific cellular properties. Finally, we apply our computational model at the level of extended tissues, and investigate stress and velocity distributions, as well as front morphologies, in expanding cellular sheets.",

    "abstract": "Viruses are one of the major causes of various acute and chronic infectious diseases and thus a major contributor to the global burden of disease. Several studies have shown how viruses have evolved to hijack basic cellular pathways and evade innate immune response by modulating key host factors and signalling pathways. A collective view of these multiple studies could advance our understanding of viral evasion mechanisms and provide new therapeutic perspectives for the treatment of viral diseases. Here, we performed an integrative meta-analysis to elucidate the 17 different host-virus interactomes. Network and bioinformatics analyses showed how viruses with small genomes efficiently achieve the maximal effect by targeting multifunctional and highly connected host proteins with a high occurrence of disordered regions. We also identified the core cellular process subnetworks that are targeted by all the viruses. Integration with functional RNA interference (RNAi) datasets showed that a large proportion of the targets are required for viral replication. Furthermore, we performed an interactome-informed drug re-purposing screen and identified novel activities for broad-spectrum antiviral agents against hepatitis C virus and human metapneumovirus. Altogether, these orthogonal datasets could serve as a platform for hypothesis generation and follow-up studies to broaden our understanding of the viral evasion landscape.",

    "abstract": "It is common to look for signatures of local adaptation in genomes by identifying loci with extreme levels of allele frequency divergence among populations. This approach to finding genes associated with local adaptation often assumes antagonistic pleiotropy, wherein alternative alleles are strongly favoured in alternative environments. Conditional neutrality has been proposed as an alternative to antagonistic pleiotropy, but conditionally neutral polymorphisms are transient and it is unclear how much outlier signal would be maintained under different forms of conditional neutrality. Here, we use individual-based simulations and a simple analytical heuristic to show that a pattern that mimics local adaptation at the phenotypic level, where each genotype has the highest fitness in its home environment, can be produced by the accumulation of mutations that are neutral in their home environment and deleterious in non-local environments. Because conditionally deleterious mutations likely arise at a rate many times higher than conditionally beneficial mutations, they can have a significant cumulative effect on fitness even when individual effect sizes are small. We show that conditionally deleterious mutations driving non-local maladaptation may be undetectable by even the most powerful genome scans, as differences in allele frequency between populations are typically small. We also explore the evolutionary effects of conditionally-beneficial mutations and find that they can maintain significant signals of local adaptation, and they would be more readily detectable than conditionally deleterious mutations using conventional genome scan approaches. We discuss implications for interpreting outcomes of transplant experiments and genome scans that are used to study the genetic basis of local adaptation.",

The model is predictive and was experimentally validated against novel media compositions. Moreover, the model was further validated against larger culture volumes at 100 mL and 1 L volumes and found to correlate well.

These changes are associated with remodeling of the redox sensitive promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies (PML NBs), an important constituent of nuclear architecture and a marker of HIV-1 latency. We found that PML is depleted in productively infected cells and restored by ART.

We used transgenic mice harbouring human tau (rTg4510) and amyloid precursor protein (J20) mutations to investigate transcriptional changes associated with the development of both tau and amyloid pathology. Using highly-parallel RNA sequencing we profiled transcriptional variation in the entorhinal cortex at four time points identifying robust genotype-associated differences in entorhinal cortex gene expression in both models. We quantified neuropathological burden across multiple brain regions in the same individual mice, identifying widespread changes in gene expression paralleling the development of tau pathology in rTg4510 mice. Differentially expressed transcripts included genes associated with familial AD from genetic studies of human patients, and genes annotated to both common and rare variants identified in GWAS and exome-sequencing studies of late-onset sporadic AD. Systems-level analyses identified discrete co-expression networks associated with the progressive accumulation of tau, with these enriched for genes and pathways previously implicated in the neuro-immunological and neurodegenerative processes driving AD pathology. Finally, we report considerable overlap between tau-associated networks and AD-associated co-expression modules identified in the human cortex.

When these variants are common in the population, these non-constitutive transcripts are sufficiently frequent so as to resemble naturally occurring, alternative mRNA splicing. Prediction of the effects of such variants has been shown to be accurate using information theory-based methods. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) predicted to significantly alter natural and/or cryptic splice site strength were shown to affect gene expression. Splicing changes for known SNP genotypes were confirmed in HapMap lymphoblastoid cell lines with gene expression microarrays and custom designed q-RT-PCR or TaqMan assays. The majority of these SNPs (15 of 22) as well as an independent set of 24 variants were then subjected to RNAseq analysis using the ValidSpliceMut web beacon (http://validsplicemut.cytognomix.com), which is based on data from the Cancer Genome Atlas and International Cancer Genome Consortium. SNPs from different genes analyzed with gene expression microarray and q-RT-PCR exhibited significant changes in affected splice site use. Thirteen SNPs directly affected exon inclusion and 10 altered cryptic site use. Homozygous SNP genotypes resulting in stronger splice sites exhibited higher levels of processed mRNA than alleles associated with weaker sites. Four SNPs exhibited variable expression among individuals with the same genotypes, masking statistically significant expression differences between alleles. Genome-wide information theory and expression analyses (RNAseq) in tumour exomes and genomes confirmed splicing effects for 7 of the HapMap SNP and 14 SNPs identified from tumour genomes. q-RT-PCR resolved rare splice isoforms with read abundance too low for statistical significance in ValidSpliceMut. Nevertheless, the web-beacon provides evidence of unanticipated splicing outcomes, for example, intron retention due to compromised recognition of constitutive splice sites. Thus, ValidSpliceMut and q-RT-PCR represent complementary resources for identification of allele-specific, alternative splicing.",
