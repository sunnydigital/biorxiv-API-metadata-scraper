    "abstract": "Genetic contributions of Neanderthals to the modern human genome have been evidenced by comparative analyses of present-day human genomes and paleogenomes. Current data indicate that Neanderthal introgression is higher in Asians and Europeans and lower in African lines of descent. Neanderthal signatures in extant human genomes are attributed to intercrosses between Neanderthals and ancient Homo sapiens lineages, or archaic Anatomically Modern Humans (AMH) that migrated from Africa into the Middle East and Europe in the last 50,000 years. It has been proposed however that there is no contribution of Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA to contemporary human genomes. Here we show that the modern human mitochondrial genome might contains potential 66 Neanderthal signatures, or Neanderthal single nucleotide variants (N-SNVs) being 36 in coding regions (7 nonsynonymous), 5 in SSU rRNA, 4 in LSU rRNA, 3 in tRNAs and 18 in the D-loop. Also, 7 N-SNVs are associated with traits such as cycling vomiting syndrome and Alzheimers and Parkinsons diseases and 2 N-SNVs associated with intelligence quotient. Based on our results with bootscan recombination tests, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the complete absence of these N-SNVs in 41 archaic AMH mitogenomes recombination events cannot explain the presence of N-SNVs in present-day human mitogenomes. These results suggest that homoplasies alone and convergent evolution can explain N-SNVs. Our data also shows that African mtDNAs have Neanderthal SNVs as has been suggested for nuclear genome. Based on our data we conclude that most intercrosses might have occurred between Neanderthal males and archaic AMH females, crosses between archaic AMH males and Neanderthal females would be extremely rare and recombination was negligible, which explains the few Neanderthal marks (66 out of 16,569bp) in present day mitochondrial genomes of human populations. These 66 signatures are probably the result of homoplasies and convergent evolution.",

    "abstract": "Recently, there has been significant amount of effort in developing space-efficient and succinct data structures for storing and building the traditional de Bruijn graph and its variants, including the colored de Bruijn graph. However, a problem not yet considered is developing a means to merge succinct representations of the de Bruijn graph--a challenge is necessary for constructing the de Bruijn graph on very-large datasets. We create VO_SCPLOWARIC_SCPLOWMO_SCPLOWERGEC_SCPLOW, for building the colored de Bruijn graph on a very-large dataset through partitioning the data into smaller subsets, building the colored de Bruijn graph using a FM-index based representation, and merging these representations in an iterative format. This last step is an algorithmic challenge for which we present an algorithm in this paper. Lastly, we demonstrate the utility of VO_SCPLOWARIC_SCPLOWMO_SCPLOWERGEC_SCPLOW by demonstrating: a four-fold reduction in working space when constructing an 8,000 color dataset, and the construction of population graph two orders of magnitude larger than previous reported methods.",

Recent developments in deep learning can yield superior accuracy, but typical evaluation metrics for nucleus segmentation do not satisfactorily capture error modes that are relevant in cellular images. Besides, large image data sets with ground truth for evaluation have been limiting. We present an evaluation framework to measure accuracy, types of errors, and computational efficiency; and use it to compare two deep learning strategies (U-Net and DeepCell) alongside a classical approach implemented in CellProfiler. We publicly release a set of 23,165 manually annotated nuclei and source code to reproduce experiments. Our results show that U-Net outperforms both pixel-wise classification networks and classical algorithms. Also, our evaluation framework shows that deep learning improves accuracy and reduces the number of biologically relevant errors by half.",

    "abstract": "Perturbations in mitochondrial function and homeostasis are pervasive in lysosomal storage diseases, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we report a transcriptional program that represses mitochondrial biogenesis and function in lysosomal storage diseases Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) and acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASM), in patient cells and mouse tissues. This mechanism is mediated by the transcription factors KLF2 and ETV1, which are both induced in NPC and ASM patient cells. Mitochondrial biogenesis and function defects in these cells are rescued by the silencing of KLF2 or ETV1. Increased ETV1 expression is regulated by KLF2, while the increase of KLF2 protein levels in NPC and ASM stems from impaired signaling downstream sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1), which normally represses KLF2. In patient cells, S1PR1 is undetectable at the plasma membrane and thus unable to repress KLF2. This manuscript provides a mechanistic pathway for the prevalent mitochondrial defects in lysosomal storage diseases.",

    "abstract": "Many clades that span the marine-freshwater boundary are disproportionately more diverse in the younger, shorter-lived, and scarcer freshwater environments than they are in the marine realm. This disparity is thought to be related to differences in diversification rates between marine and freshwater lineages. However, marine and freshwaters are not ecologically homogeneous, so the study of diversification across the salinity divide should also account for other potentially interacting variables. In diatoms, freshwater and substrate-associated (benthic) lineages are several-fold more diverse than their marine and suspended (planktonic) counterparts. These imbalances provide an excellent system to understand whether these variables interact with diversification. Using multistate hidden-state speciation and extinction models we found that freshwater lineages diversify faster than marine lineages regardless of whether they inhabit the plankton or the benthos. Freshwater lineages also had higher turnover rates (speciation + extinction), suggesting that habitat transitions impact speciation and extinction rates jointly. The plankton-benthos contrast was also consistent with state-dependent diversification, but with modest differences in diversification and turnover rates. Asymmetric, and bidirectional transitions rejected hypotheses about the plankton and freshwaters as absorbing, inescapable habitats. Our results further suggest that the high turnover rate of freshwater diatoms is related to high turnover of freshwater systems themselves.",

    "abstract": "Inferior olivary activity causes both short-term and long-term changes in cerebellar output underlying motor adaptation and motor learning, respectively. Many of its neurons engage in coherent subthreshold oscillations and are extensively coupled via gap junctions. Studies in reduced preparations suggest that these properties promote rhythmic, synchronized output. However, how these properties interact with synaptic inputs controlling inferior olivary output in intact, awake behaving animals is poorly understood. Here we combine electrophysiological recordings in awake mice with a novel and realistic tissue-scale computational model of the inferior olive to study the relative impact of intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms governing its activity. Our data and model suggest that oscillations are present in the awake state, but that the period of subthreshold oscillations is variable, resulting in semi-periodic activity, which result in the high unpredictability of sensory-triggered complex spikes occurring in windows of opportunity lasting a few tens of milliseconds. To test the resonant properties of complex spike firing we used different temporal patterns of sensory stimulation in awake mice. Resonance was found to be limited to short intervals no more than a few hundred milliseconds, which could be explained by our network model to be a result of synaptic input to the inferior olive. The model also shows how gap junctional coupling stiffens the olivary network response to sensory modulation of complex spike rhythmicity. Interactions between intrinsic properties and extrinsic inputs can explain short-lasting semi- periodic variations of the spiking rhythms of olivary neurons even though their long-term average firing rate is stable, providing a conceptual framework for the creation of both the short-term and long-term changes in cerebellar output.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYActivity of the inferior olive, transmitted via climbing fibers to the cerebellum, regulates initiation and amplitude of movements, signals unexpected sensory feedback, and directs cerebellar learning. It is characterized by widespread subthreshold oscillations and synchronization promoted by strong electrotonic coupling. In brain slices, subthreshold oscillations set a temporal framework determining which inputs can be transmitted by inferior olivary neurons and which will not - dependent on the phase of the oscillation. In our study, we tested whether the subthreshold oscillations had any impact on temporal patterning of climbing fiber activity in intact, awake mice. We did so by recording neural activity of the postsynaptic Purkinje cells, in which complex spike firing faithfully represents climbing fiber activity. For short intervals (<300 ms), we found that many Purkinje cells indeed showed spontaneously rhythmic complex spike activity. However, our experiments designed to evoke resonant responses clearly indicated that complex spikes are not predicated on stimulus history. Our realistic network model of the inferior olive explains the experimental findings via continuous phase modulations of the subthreshold oscillations. We conclude that inferior olivary activity is emerging from an aperiodic rhythm, stabilized by electrotonic coupling, and dependent on the behavioral context transmitted via synaptic input.",

SIT can occur with Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD). However, most people with SIT do not have PCD, and the etiology of their condition remains poorly studied. Those without PCD may have an elevated rate of left-handedness, implying developmental mechanisms linking brain and body laterality. We sequenced the genomes of 15 people with SIT, of which six had PCD, and 15 controls. The SIT subjects with PCD all had likely recessive mutations in genes already known to cause PCD. Two non-PCD SIT cases also had recessive mutations in known PCD genes, suggesting reduced penetrance for PCD in some SIT cases. One non-PCD SIT case had a recessive mutation in PKD1L1, which has previously been linked to SIT without PCD. However, six of the nine non-PCD SIT cases, including most of the left-handers in this dataset, had no obvious candidate genes or significant pathways affected by the mutations that they carried. While we cannot exclude a monogenic basis, more complex genetic models must also be considered, as well as environmental influences or random effects in early development.",

    "abstract": "Protected areas currently cover about 15% of the global land area and constitute one of the main tools in biodiversity conservation. Quantifying their effectiveness at protecting species from decline and local extinction involves comparing protected with counterfactual unprotected sites representing \\\"what would have happened to protected sites if they had not been protected\\\". Most studies are based on pairwise comparisons, using as counterfactuals neighbour sites to protected areas, but this choice is often subjective and may be prone to biases. An alternative is to use large-scale biodiversity monitoring datasets, which whereby the effect of protected areas is analysed statistically by controlling for landscape differences between protected and unprotected sites, allowing a more targeted and clearly defined measure of protected areas effect. Here we use the North American Breeding Bird Survey dataset as a case study to investigate protected areas effectiveness in conserving bird assemblages. We analysed the effect of protected areas on species richness, assemblage-level abundance and abundance of individual species by modelling how these metrics relate to the proportion of each site that is protected, while controlling for site habitat, altitude, productivity and spatial autocorrelation. At the assemblage level, we found no relationship between protection and species richness or overall abundance. At the species level, we found that species that avoid human activities tend to be favoured by protected areas are the one avoiding human activities. Moreover, we found that forest protected areas presented higher abundances of forest species, making the assemblage more typical of this habitat. We did not find that declining species were particularly favoured by protected areas. Our results highlight the complexity of answering the question of protected areas effectiveness, and the necessity to define clearly metrics measured and the controls used.",

In this manuscript, previous work on characterizing target inhibition at steady state using the AFIR metric [1] is extended to include a \\\"target-tissue\\\" compartment and the shedding of membrane-bound targets. A new potency metric AFTIR (Averarge Free Tissue target to Initial target ratio at steady state) is derived, and it depends on only four key quantities: the equilibrium binding constant, the fold-change in target expression at steady state after binding to drug, the biodistribution of target from circulation to target tissue, and the average drug concentration in circulation. The AFTIR metric is useful for guiding dose selection, for efficiently performing sensitivity analyses, and for building intuition for more complex target mediated drug disposition models. In particular, reducing the complex, physiological model to four key parameters needed to predict target inhibition helps to highlight specific parameters that are the most important to estimate in future experiments to guide drug development.\\n\\nGraphical Abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=145 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/432500_fig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (30K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6895d7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4566e0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6515e8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8168ea_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFig. 1C_FLOATNO Graphical Abstract\\n\\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Aboveground plant efficiency has improved significantly in recent years, and the improvement has led to a steady increase in global food production. The improvement of belowground plant efficiency has potential to further increase food production. However, belowground plant roots are harder to study, due to inherent challenges presented by root phenotyping. Several tools for identifying root anatomical features in root cross-section images have been proposed. However, the existing tools are not fully automated and require significant human effort to produce accurate results. To address this limitation, we use a fully automated approach, specifically, the Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), to identify anatomical traits in root cross-section images. By training Faster R-CNN models on root cross-section images, we can detect objects such as root, stele and late metaxylem, and predict rectangular bounding boxes around such objects. Subsequently, the bounding boxes can be used to estimate the root diameter, stele diameter, late metaxylem number, and average diameter. Experimental evaluation using standard object detection metrics, such as intersection-over-union and mean average precision, has shown that the Faster R-CNN models trained on rice root cross-section images can accurately detect root, stele and late metaxylem objects. Furthermore, the results have shown that the measurements estimated based on predicted bounding boxes have small root mean square error when compared with the corresponding ground truth values, suggesting that Faster R-CNN can be used to accurately detect anatomical features. A webserver for performing root anatomy using the Faster R-CNN models trained on rice images is available at https://rootanatomy.org, together with a link to a GitHub repository that contains a copy of the Faster R-CNN code. The labeled images used for training and evaluating the Faster R-CNN models are also available from the GitHub repository.",

    "abstract": "Crop residues are a crucial ecological niche with a major biological impact on agricultural ecosystems. In this study we used a combined diachronic and synchronic field experiment based on wheat-oilseed rape rotations to test the hypothesis that plant is a structuring factor of microbial communities in crop residues, and that this effect decreases over time with their likely progressive degradation and colonization by other microorganisms. We characterized an entire fungal and bacterial community associated with 150 wheat and oilseed rape residue samples at a plurennial scale by metabarcoding. The impact of plant species on the residue microbiota decreased over time and our data revealed turnover, with the replacement of oligotrophs, often plant-specific genera (such as pathogens) by copiotrophs, belonging to more generalist genera. Within a single cropping season, the plant-specific genera and species were gradually replaced by taxa that are likely to originate from the soil. These changes occurred more rapidly for bacteria than for fungi, known to degrade complex compounds. Overall, our findings suggest that crop residues constitute a key fully-fledged microbial ecosystem. Taking into account this ecosystem, that has been neglected for too long, is essential, not only to improve the quantitative management of residues, the presence of which can be detrimental to crop health, but also to identify groups of beneficial micro-organisms. Our findings are of particular importance, because the wheat-oilseed rape rotation, in which no-till practices are frequent, is particularly widespread in the European arable cropping systems.",

Our previous studies have shown asymmetric projections between the primary visual and somatosensory cortices in mice. Binocular enucleation produces a relative reduction of the projections from the somatosensory cortex to the visual cortex in mice. The purpose of this study is to compare the direct reciprocal cross-modal connections between the primary visual (V1) and somatosensory (S1) cortices in intact and enucleated C57Bl/6 mice, and to determine quantitative differences in the proportion and laminar distribution of neurons and terminals in these projections. CTB labeled neurons were used to estimate the relative importance of projections between V1 and S1, and their laminar distribution used to classify them as feedback, feedforward or lateral projections. The size of axonal swellings was measured and frequency distribution determined for each cortical layer. Axon diameters were also sampled in these connections. Injections in V1 resulted in a reduced proportion of labeled cells in S1 of enucleated mice. There was a relative decrease of the projection from the somatosensory cortex to the visual cortex in enucleated mice due to a greater relative reduction of supragranular layers neurons. Enucleation otherwise had no effect on the connectivity of the somatosensory cortex with other motor and somatosensory cortices. In the projection from the visual to the somatosensory cortex in enucleated mice, the size of axonal swellings was reduced in all layers. Conversely, in the projection from the somatosensory cortex to the visual cortex, some larger swellings appeared in the supragranular layers. This shows pathway and laminar specific changes in cortical circuitry following loss of sensory afferent activity that results in changes in the relationship between visual and somatosensory cortices in the enucleated mice.",

    "abstract": "Unliganded nuclear receptors have been implicated in ligand-dependent gene regulation. However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we demonstrate that unliganded ER binds to specific sites in the genome thereby pre-marking them as future functional enhancers. Upon ligand exposure, ER binds to several EREs relatively proximal to the pre-marked, or persistent, ER-bound sites. Interestingly, the persistent sites interact extensively, via chromatin looping, with the proximal transiently bound sites forming ER clustered enhancers in 3D. CRISPR-based deletion of TFF1 persistent site disrupts the formation of its clustered enhancer resulting in the loss of E2-dependent induced expression of TFF1 and its neighboring genes within the same cluster. The clustered enhancers overlap with nuclear ER puncta that coalesce in a ligand-dependent manner. Furthermore, formation of clustered enhancers, as well as puncta, coincide with the active phase of signaling and their later disappearance results in the loss of gene expression even though persistent sites remain bound by ER. Our results establish the role of persistent unliganded ER binding in priming enhancer clusters in 3D that drive transient, but robust, gene expression in a ligand-dependent fashion.",

As an alternative to a protective vaccine we developed a genetic engineering strategy in which CRISPR/Cas9 was utilized to replace endogenously-encoded antibodies with antibodies protective against RSV, HIV, influenza or EBV in primary human or murine B cells. The engineered antibodies were expressed in up to 59% of primary B cells under the control of endogenous regulatory elements, which maintained normal antibody expression and secretion. Importantly, a single transfer of murine B cells engineered to express an antibody protective against RSV resulted in potent and durable protection against RSV infection in immunocompromised hosts. This approach offers the opportunity to achieve sterilizing immunity against pathogens for which traditional vaccination has failed to induce or maintain protective antibody responses.",

Factors influencing host evolution might affect symbionts in similar ways, potentially leading to correlations between the molecular evolutionary rates of hosts and symbionts. Although there is evidence of rate correlations between mitochondrial and nuclear genes, similar investigations of hosts and symbionts are lacking. Here we demonstrate a correlation in molecular rates between the genomes of an endosymbiont (Blattabacterium cuenoti) and the mitochondrial genomes of their hosts (cockroaches). We used partial genome data for multiple strains of B. cuenoti to compare phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary rates for 55 cockroach/symbiont pairs. The phylogenies inferred for B. cuenoti and the mitochondrial genomes of their hosts were largely congruent, as expected from their identical maternal and cytoplasmic mode of inheritance. We found a correlation between evolutionary rates of the two genomes, based on comparisons of root-to-tip distances and on comparisons of the branch lengths of phylogenetically independent species pairs. Our results underscore the profound effects that long-term symbiosis can have on the biology of each symbiotic partner.",

These abnormal light chains misfold and accumulate as amyloid fibrils in healthy tissues causing devastating multi-organ dysfunction that is rapidly fatal. Current treatment regimens, which include proteasome inhibitors, alkylating agents, and immunomodulatory agents, were developed for the treatment of the more common plasma cell disease, multiple myeloma, and have limited efficacy in AL amyloidosis as demonstrated by the median survival of 2-3 years. The recent development of novel small-molecule inhibitors of the major pro-survival proteins from the apoptosis-regulating BCL-2 family has created an opportunity to therapeutically target abnormal cell populations, yet identifying the extent of these dependencies and how to target them clinically has thus far been challenging. Using bone marrow-derived plasma cells from 45 patients with AL amyloidosis, we find that clonal plasma cells are highly primed to undergo apoptosis and exhibit strong dependencies on pro-survival BCL-2 family proteins. Specifically, we find that clonal plasma cells in a majority of patients are highly dependent on the pro-survival protein MCL-1 and undergo apoptosis when treated with an MCL-1 inhibitor as a single agent. In addition, BCL-2 inhibition sensitizes clonal plasma cells to several current standard of care therapies. Our results suggest that BH3 mimetics, when deployed rationally, may be highly effective therapies for AL amyloidosis.",

They safeguard genome integrity by resolving chromosome multimers, as well as mobilize transposons, phages and integrons, driving dissemination of genetic traits and antibiotic resistance. Despite their abundance and genetic impact, tyrosine recombinase diversity and evolution has not been thoroughly characterized, which greatly hampers their functional classification.\n\nResultsHere, we conducted a comprehensive search and comparative analysis of diverse tyrosine recombinases from bacterial, archaeal and phage genomes. We characterized their major phylogenetic groups and show that recombinases of integrons and insertion sequences are closely related to the chromosomal Xer proteins, while integrases of integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) and phages are more distant. We find that proteins in distinct phylogenetic groups share specific structural features and have characteristic taxonomic distribution. We further trace tyrosine recombinase evolution and propose that phage and ICE integrases originated by acquisition of an N-terminal arm-binding domain. Based on this phylogeny, we classify numerous known ICEs and predict new ones.\n\nConclusionsThis work provides a new resource for comparative analysis and functional annotation of tyrosine recombinases. We reconstitute protein evolution and show that adaptation for a role in gene transfer involved acquisition of a specific protein domain, which allows precise regulation of excision and integration.",

Total of 36,847,092 raw reads (3.68 GB) were generated for all samples and 3,329,625 of high-quality reads were aligned uniquely to the reference tomato genome. Using stringent filtering, a total of 1,165 SNPs and 69 INDELs were found in genic regions, along with the unique variants to each cultivar was observed. Similarly, 7 and 33 variants were identified in chloroplast and mitochondrial genome of tomato. In addition, the population structure and genetic relationship among these cultivars suggested 4 well-differentiated sub-populations. Functional annotation of SNP/INDLEs associated with flanking sequences along with gene ontology and pathway analysis was performed. Identified SNPs/INDELs could be useful as markers for variety identification for genetic purity analysis.

    "abstract": "Somatic evolution of cancer involves a series of mutations, and attendant changes, in one or more clones of cells. A \\\"bad luck\\\" type model assumes chance accumulation of mutations. The clonal expansion model assumes, on the other hand, that any mutation leading to partial loss of regulation of cell proliferation will give a selective advantage to the mutant. However, a number of experiments show that an intermediate pre-cancer mutant has only a conditional selective advantage. Given that tissue microenvironmental conditions differ across individual organisms, this selective advantage to a mutant could be widely distributed over the population of organisms. We evaluate three models, namely \\\"bad luck\\\", context-independent, and -dependent selection, in a comparative framework, on their ability to predict patterns in total incidence, age-specific incidence, and their ability to explain Peto's paradox. Results show that context dependence is necessary and sufficient to explain observed epidemiological patterns, and that cancer incidence is largely selection-limited, rather than mutation-limited. A wide range of physiological, genetic and behavioural factors influence the tissue micro-environment, and could therefore be the source of this context dependence in somatic evolution of cancer. The identification and targeting of these micro-environmental factors that influence the dynamics of selection offer new possibilities for cancer prevention.",

    "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a disorder with no clear FDA-approved treatments that reduce symptoms in the majority of patients. PTSD individuals possess an impaired capacity for extinguishing fear memory associations. As such, considerable focus has been given to the development of extinction-enhancing pharmacological agents to be used in combination with PTSD treatments. Here we use a predator-threat animal model of PTSD to test the ability of two compounds to enhance contextual fear extinction and reduce anxiety. Mirroring the heterogeneity observed in human response to trauma, an exposure to predator threat, including the fox odor TMT, have been shown to induce long-term changes in anxiety behavior in only subsets of susceptible rats. Here, two weeks following a ten-minute exposure to a predator odor, rats were classified into stress-Susceptible (Sus) and stress-Resilient (Res) phenotypes using cut-off behavioral criteria for elevated plus maze and acoustic startle response performance. One week following classification, Sus rats underwent three days of context fear extinction. We found that Sus rats increased freezing from day one to day two. Treatment with the mGlu5 positive allosteric modulator CDPPB, but not the phytocannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD), prior to sessions resulted in reduced freezing. CDPPB administration resulted in an increase of Fos immunoreactive cells in the medial prefrontal cortex, indicative of increased neuronal activity. Finally, we used the light-dark box test to measure phenotypic differences and the effects of CDPPB and CBD on unconditioned anxiety two weeks after classification. We found that Res rats showed less anxiety compared to Sus rats, and that CBD, but not CDPPB, administered prior to testing was anxiolytic in Sus rats. Taken together, the present data indicate that mGlu5 PAMs such as CDPPB hold promise for treating human PTSD patients as they enhance extinction of fear without increasing general anxiety. Polytherapy with medications such as CBD may be necessary in order to attenuate general anxiety and future directions will explore this hypothesis.",

Understanding these relationships is central to demographic inference, correction of population structure in GWAS, identifying signals of selection etc. The data structure containing the full information about sample genealogy is called the ancestral recombination graph (ARG).

In this work we describe a new approach for fast and scalable generation of local tree topologies relating large numbers of haplotypes. Our method is closely related to the estimation of ARG, and captures both local and global properties of an ARG. It is based on a data structure which we call tree consistent PBWT, a modification of PBWT data structure introduced by R. Durbin (2014). We also explore some methods to estimate the quality of the generated tree topologies and to make inferences based on them. At the end we discuss a probabilistic model which could potentially lead to the estimation of ARG node times.",

However, CLA consumption is limited to meats and milk products as CLA is generated in ruminants. This study aimed to replace vegetable fat by goat cream enriched with CLA. Four cookie recipes were developed with only the fat source being different: CVF - vegetable fat; CB - butter; CGC - goat cream without CLA; CGCLA - goat cream with CLA. Cookies were evaluated according to physical (color and texture) and physical-chemical parameters (lipids, proteins, total sugars, fiber, ash, moisture and Aw), Consumer Testing (n = 123) and lipid profile. The CGCLA presented higher values in the color parameters, and the higher and the lower scores in relation to hardness were 5.54 (CB) and 2.21 (CVF), respectively. Lipids and total sugars varied inversely, and the highest percentages of lipids were in the CVF and CG samples, which obtained lower total sugar content. There was no difference in the acceptance and preference of the four formulations, and the formulations with the goat creams (CG and CGCLA) were as accepted as CFV. The lipid profile of the cookies presented CFV with the highest percentage of trans fatty acids (TFA) with 16.76 %. CGCLA presented 70 % more CLA in relation to CB and CGC, thus certifying that CLA was present in relevant quantities in the CGCLA, even after cooking. The CGCLA is a biscuit with higher levels of CLA, and in this study it was possible to verify that the goat milk cream enriched with CLA can be used in producing cookies which adds functional and nutritional properties to them and offers other alternatives to produce food from goat's milk cream.",

It is then important to understand how internal and external stresses can modify them. To study the mechanical response of the nucleus at different timescales, a hybrid viscoelastic model integrating both continuum mechanics and soft glass matter theory is developed. It indeed accounts for the instantaneous viscoelastic response of the structural components of the nucleus as well as the active response of the nuclear envelope and the dynamic reorganization of the cytoskeleton at different timescales. This model can describe adequately the nuclear deformation caused by substrate stiffness in primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells in culture up to 5 days. It also reveals that the increase of nuclear strain in the long term implies nuclear softening (a phenomenon intensified on stiffer substrates), simultaneously with an increase of the dissipative properties of the nucleus, offering stability. Finally, in the context of soft glassy theory, the model suggests that processes of aging and mechanical memory of the cell may be originated by the dissipative capacity of the nuclei.",

    "abstract": "To prevent or ameliorate Alzheimer's disease (AD) we must understand its molecular basis. AD develops over decades but detailed molecular analysis of AD brains is limited to postmortem tissue where the stresses initiating the disease may be obscured by compensatory responses and neurodegenerative processes. Rare, dominant mutations in a small number of genes, but particularly the gene PRESENILIN 1 (PSEN1), drive early onset of familial AD (EOfAD). Numerous transgenic models of AD have been constructed in mouse and other organisms, but transcriptomic analysis of these models has raised serious doubts regarding their representation of the disease state. Since we lack clarity regarding the molecular mechanism(s) underlying AD, we posit that the most valid approach is to model the human EOfAD genetic state as closely as possible. Therefore, we sought to analyse brains from zebrafish heterozygous for a single, EOfAD-like mutation in their PSEN1-orthologous gene, psen1. We previously introduced an EOfAD-like mutation (Q96_K97del) into the endogenous psen1 gene of zebrafish. Here, we analysed transcriptomes of young adult (6-month-old) entire brains from a family of heterozygous mutant and wild type sibling fish. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed effects on mitochondria, particularly ATP synthesis, and on ATP-dependent processes including vacuolar acidification.",

    "abstract": "Gametogenesis is dependent on intercellular communication facilitated by stable intercellular bridges connecting developing germ cells. During Drosophila oogenesis, intercellular bridges (referred to as ring canals) have a dynamic actin cytoskeleton that drives their expansion to a diameter of 10m. While multiple proteins have been identified as components of ring canals (RCs), we lack a basic understanding of how RC proteins interact together to form and regulate the RC cytoskeleton. We optimized a procedure for proximity-dependent biotinylation in live tissue using the APEX enzyme to interrogate the RC interactome. APEX was fused to four different RC components (RC-APEX baits) and 55 unique high-confidence preys were identified. The RC-APEX baits produced almost entirely distinct interactomes that included both known RC proteins as well as uncharacterized proteins. The proximity ligation assay was used to validate close-proximity interactions between the RC-APEX baits and their respective preys. Further, an RNAi screen revealed functional roles for several high-confidence prey genes in RC biology. These findings highlight the utility of enzyme-catalyzed proximity labeling for protein interactome analysis in live tissue and expand our understanding of RC biology.",

    "abstract": "Trypanosoma cruzi, causative agent of Chagas disease, and T. rangeli are kinetoplastid parasites endemic to Latin America. Although closely-related to T. cruzi and capable of infecting humans, T. rangeli is non-pathogenic. Both parasite species are transmitted by triatomine bugs, and the presence of T. rangeli constitutes a confounding factor in the study of Chagas prevalence and transmission dynamics. T. cruzi possesses high molecular heterogeneity: six discrete typing units (DTUs) are currently recognized. In Ecuador, TcI predominates while other DTUs are seldom reported. Here, infection by T. cruzi and/or T. rangeli in triatomine bugs from two communities of southern Ecuador was evaluated via PCR product size polymorphism of kinetoplast-minicircle sequences and the non-transcribed spacer region of the mini-exon gene. Additionally, mini-exon amplicons were deep-sequenced to analyze single nucleotide polymorphisms and mixed infections. As a control, mini-exon products from several monoclonal reference strains were included. T. cruzi genetic diversity was significantly greater in adult vectors than in nymphal stage V vectors. Among infected triatomines, deep sequencing revealed one T. rangeli infection (3%), 9 T. cruzi infections (27.3%) and 23 T. cruzi / T. rangeli mixed infections (69.7%), suggesting that T. rangeli prevalence has been largely underestimated in the region. Furthermore, deep-sequencing detected TcIV sequences in six samples (first TcIV record in southern Ecuador). Our data indicate that amplicon size analysis alone is not reliable for parasite identification/typing in mixed infections containing both T. cruzi and T. rangeli, or when multiple T. cruzi DTUs are present. Additionally, our analysis showed extensive overlap among the parasite populations present in the two studied localities (ca. 28 km apart); suggesting active parasite dispersal over the study area. Our results highlight the value of amplicon sequencing methodologies to clarify the population dynamics of kinetoplastid parasites in endemic regions and inform control campaigns in southern Ecuador.",

Macrophages serve as viral reservoirs due to their resistance to apoptosis and HIV-cytopathic effects. We have previously shown that inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) confer resistance to HIV-Vpr-induced apoptosis in normal macrophages. Herein, we show that second mitochondrial activator of caspases (SMAC)-mimetics (SM) specifically induce apoptosis of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) infected in vitro with a R5-tropic laboratory strain expressing heat stable antigen, and GFP-expressing HIV, chronically infected U1 cells, and ex-vivo derived MDMs from naive and ART-treated HIV patients. SM-induced cell death was found to be mediated by IAPs using IAP siRNAs, was independent of endogenously produced TNF and was attributed to the concomitant downregulation of IAP-1/2 and the receptor interacting protein kinase-1 degradation following HIV infection. Altogether, modulation of the IAP pathways may be a potential strategy for selective killing of HIV-infected macrophages in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Membrane-potential dynamics mediate bacterial electrical signaling at both intra- and inter- cellular levels. Membrane potential is also central to cellular proliferation. It is unclear whether the cellular response to external electrical stimuli is influenced by the cell proliferative capacity. A new strategy enabling electrical stimulation of bacteria with simultaneous monitoring of single-cell membrane potential dynamics would allow bridging this knowledge gap and further extend electrophysiological studies into the field of microbiology. Here we report that an identical electrical stimulus can cause opposite polarization dynamics depending on cellular proliferation capacity. This was demonstrated using two model organisms, namely B. subtilis and E. coli, and by developing an apparatus enabling exogenous electrical stimulation and single-cell time-lapse microscopy. Using this bespoke apparatus, we show that a 2.5 sec electrical stimulation causes hyperpolarization in unperturbed cells. Measurements of intracellular K+ and the deletion of the K+ channel suggested that the hyperpolarization response is caused by the K+ efflux through the channel. When cells are pre-exposed to UV-violet light, the same electrical stimulation depolarizes cells instead of causing hyperpolarization. A mathematical model extended from the FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron model suggested that the opposite response dynamics are due to the shift in resting membrane potential. As predicted by the model, electrical stimulation only induced depolarization when cells are treated with antibiotics, protonophore or alcohol. Therefore, electrically induced membrane potential dynamics offer a novel and reliable approach for rapid detection of proliferative bacteria and determination of their sensitivity to antimicrobial agents at the single-cell level.",

    "abstract": "A well-defined set of regulatory pathways control entry into the reproductive phase in flowering plants [1]. Conversely, little is known about the mechanisms that control the end of the reproductive phase ( floral arrest), despite this being a critical process for optimising fruit and seed production. Complete fruit removal or lack of fertile fruit-set in male sterile mutants, for example male sterile1 (ms1), prevents timely floral arrest in the model plant Arabidopsis [2]. These observations formed the basis for Hensel and colleagues model in which end-of-flowering was proposed to result from a cumulative fruit/seed-derived signal that caused simultaneous  global proliferative arrest (GPA) in all inflorescences [2]. Recent studies have suggested that end-of-flowering involves gene expression changes at the floral meristem which are at least in part controlled by the FRUITFULL-APETELA2 pathway [3,4], however there is limited understanding of how this process is controlled and the communication needed at the whole plant level. Here, we provide new information providing a framework for the fruit-to-meristem (F-M) communication implied by the GPA model [5]. We show that floral arrest in Arabidopsis is not  global and does not occur synchronously between branches, but rather that the arrest of each inflorescence is a local process, driven by auxin export from fruit proximal to the inflorescence meristem (IM). Furthermore, we show that inflorescence meristems are only competent for floral arrest once they reach a certain developmental age. Understanding the regulation of floral arrest is of major importance for the future manipulation of flowering to extend and maximise crop yields.",

Since proteostasis can modulate mutational buffering, if change in metabolism has the ability to change proteostasis, arguably, it should also alter mutational buffering. Building on this, we find that altered cellular metabolic states in E. coli buffer distinct mutations. Buffered-mutants had folding problems in vivo and were differently chaperoned in different metabolic states. Notably, this assistance was dependent upon the metabolites and not on the increase in canonical chaperone machineries. Additionally, we were able to reconstitute the folding assistance afforded by metabolites in vitro and propose that changes in metabolite concentrations have the potential to alter proteostasis. Collectively, we unravel that the metabolite pools are bona fide members of proteostasis and aid in mutational buffering. Given the plasticity in cellular metabolism, we posit that metabolic alterations may play an important role in the positive or negative regulation of proteostasis.",

Here we performed a systems-based analysis of nitrogen metabolism in intracellullar Mtb and developed 15N-Flux Spectral Ratio Analysis (FSRA) to probe the metabolic cross-talk between the host cell and Mtb. We demonstrate that intracellular Mtb acquires nitrogen from multiple amino acids in the macrophage including glutamate, glutamine, aspartate, alanine, glycine and valine, with glutamine being the predominant nitrogen donor. Each nitrogen source is uniquely assimilated into specific intracellular pools indicating compartmentalised metabolism. This was not observed for in vitro-grown Mtb indicating that there is a switch in nitrogen metabolism when the pathogen enters the intracellular environment.

It was reported that four genes from this cluster bmpD-bmpC-bmpA-bmpB are expressed in vitro as monocistronic and polycistronic messages. Evidence is presented in this report that bmpA mRNA contains two ribosome binding sites (SD) separated by 90 bases pairs. The SD1 precedes a small 32 amino acid ORF - leader peptide (BmpAL). The SD2 is the RBS for 342 amino acids BmpA. The bmpAL and bmpA ORFs in B.burgdorferi 297 overlap by eight base pairs suggesting that two proteins can be co-regulated. First five codons in the leader peptide and -GGG- in SD2 are rarely used in Borrelia, suggesting that they can regulate BmpAL and BmpA expression. Deletion of SD1 in the leader sequence, or introducing a stop codon immediately before SD2 leads to increased BmpA::GFP expression in B.burgdorferi 297 that contains bmpA::gfp translational fusion on the plasmid. In B. garinii G25 and B. afzelii IP3 the leader sequence is in frame with bmpA, and a result, in B. afzelii IP3 BmpA are expressed as the higher molecular weight protein compared to BmpA of B. burgdorferi 297 and B. afzelii DK7.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are a dynamic eukaryotic innovation that play diverse roles in biology and disease. The mitochondrial genome is remarkably conserved in all vertebrates, encoding the same 37 gene set and overall genomic structure ranging from 16,596 base pairs (bp) in the teleost zebrafish (Danio rerio) to 16,569 bp in humans. Mitochondrial disorders are amongst the most prevalent inherited diseases affecting roughly 1 in every 5000 individuals. Currently, few effective treatments exist for those with mitochondrial ailments, representing a major unmet patient need. Mitochondrial dysfunction is also implicated to be a common component of a wide variety of other human illnesses ranging from neurodegenerative disorders like Huntingtons disease and Parkinsons disease to autoimmune illnesses such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. The electron transport chain (ETC) component of mitochondria is critical for mitochondrial biology and defects can lead to many mitochondrial disease symptoms. Here we present a publicly available collection of genetic mutants created in highly conserved, nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes in Danio rerio. The zebrafish system represents a potentially powerful new opportunity for the study of mitochondrial biology and disease due to the large number of orthologous genes shared with humans and the many advanced features of this model system from genetics to imaging. This collection includes 22 mutant lines in 18 different genes created by locus-specific gene editing to induce frameshift or splice acceptor mutations leading to predicted protein truncation during translation. Also included are 6 lines created by the random insertion of the gene-breaking transposon (GBT) protein trap cassette. All of these targeted mutant alleles truncate conserved domains of genes critical to the proper function of the ETC or genes that have been implicated in human mitochondrial disease. This collection is designed to accelerate the use of zebrafish to study of many different aspects of mitochondrial function with the goal of widening our understanding of their role in biology and human disease.",

    "abstract": "SNAP-25 is essential in activity-dependent vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release in the nervous system. During development and adulthood, SNAP-25 appears to have differential influences on long- and short-term synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. The involvement of SNAP-25 in this process may be altered by two different splice variants expressed in adolescences versus adulthood in hippocampal neurons. This study suggests that the adolescent isoform, SNAP-25a can contribute to developmental regulation of the expression of LTD and LTP. In mice deficient in SNAP-25b, the adult isoform, Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses showed slower release kinetics, reduced initial release probabilities, decreased LTP and enhanced LTD at 1 month. By 4 months of age, when mice have fully developed in the absence of SNAP-25b, the gene targeted mice appear to have compensated for the lack of the adult SNAP-25b isoform. Moreover, hippocampal-dependent training reversed reductions in LTP, but not LTD, seen at 1 month. In 4 month old adult mice, training prevented the compensatory reversal of LTD that had been observed prior to training. These findings support the hypothesis that immature SNAP-25a plays a strong role in the expression of plasticity at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses in adolescent mice, but compensatory mechanisms that reverse alterations in synaptic plasticity once mice reach adulthood.",

    "abstract": "Aging and fertility are two interconnected processes. From invertebrates to mammals, absence of the germline increases longevity by a still not fully understood mechanism. We find that loss of function of sul-2, the Caenorhabditis elegans steroid sulfatase (STS), raises the pool of sulfated steroid hormones and increases longevity. This increased longevity requires factors involved in germline-mediated longevity (daf-16, daf-12, kri-1, tcer-1 and daf-36 genes) and is not additive to the longevity of germline-less mutants. Noteworthy, sul-2 mutations do not affect fertility. Thus, STS inactivation affects the germline signalling process regulating longevity. Interestingly, sul-2 is only expressed in sensory neurons, suggesting a regulation of germline longevity by environmental cues. We also demonstrate that treatment with the specific STS inhibitor STX64, reproduces the longevity phenotype of sul-2 mutants. Remarkably, STS inhibition by either mutation or drug treatment ameliorates protein aggregation diseases in C. elegans models of Parkinson, Huntington and Alzheimer, as well as Alzheimer disease in a mammalian model. These results open the possibility of reallocating steroid sulfatase inhibitors for the treatment of aging and aging related diseases.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCompulsive behaviors, one of the core symptoms of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), are defined as repetitive behaviors performed through rigid rituals. The lack of behavioral flexibility has been as being one of the primary causes of compulsions, but studies exploring this dimension have shown inconsistencies in different tasks performed in human and animal models of compulsive behavior. The aim of this study was so to assess the involvement of behavioral flexibility in compulsion, with a similar approach across different species sharing a common symptom of compulsivity.\\n\\nMethods40 OCD patients, 40 healthy individually matched control subjects, 26 C57BL/6J Sapap3 KO mice and 26 matched wildtype littermates were included in this study. A similar reversal learning task was designed to assess behavioral flexibility in parallel in these two species.\\n\\nResultsWhen considered as homogeneous groups, OCD patients and KO mice expressing compulsive behaviors did not significantly differ from their controls regarding behavioral flexibility. When clinical subtypes were considered, only patients exhibiting checking compulsions were impaired with more trials needed to reach the reversal criterion. In KO mice, a similarly impaired subgroup was identified. For both species, this impairment did not result in a greater perseveration after reversal, but in a greater lability in their responses in the reversal condition. Moreover, this impairment did not correlate with the severity of compulsive behaviors.\\n\\nConclusionsIn our cross-species study, we found no consistent link between compulsive behaviors and a lack of behavioral flexibility. However, we showed in both species that the compulsive group was heterogeneous in term of performance in our reversal learning task. Among the compulsive subjects, we identified a subgroup with impaired performance not due to perseverative and rigid behaviors as commonly hypothesized, but rather to an increase in response lability.",

Acetylation of -tubulin by the acetyl-transferase ATAT1 modulates microtubule dynamics and functions in neurons. However, it remains unclear how and why this enzyme acetylates microtubules over long distances in axons. Here, we show that loss of ATAT1 impairs axonal transport in neurons and cell free motility assays confirm a requirement of tubulin acetylation for proper bidirectional vesicular transport. Moreover, we demonstrate that the main cellular pool of ATAT1 is transported at the cytosolic side of neuronal vesicles that are moving along axons. Altogether, our data suggest that axonal transport of ATAT1-enriched vesicles is the predominant driver of -tubulin acetylation in axons.",

Characterized by exocrine insufficiency of the pancreas, bone marrow hypoplasia resulting in cytopenias, especially neutropenia, variable degree of skeletal abnormalities, failure to thrive, and increasing risk of developing myelodysplasia or transformation to leukemia. SDS is mainly caused by Shwachman Bodian Diamond Syndrome gene (MIM ID 607444). SBDS gene is 14899 bp in length, located in chromosome seven in the eleventh region of the long arm, and is composed of five exons. It's a ribosomal maturation factor which encodes a highly conservative protein that has widely unknown functions despite of its abundance in the nucleolus. A total number of 53 SNPs of homo sapiens SBDS gene were obtained from the national center for biotechnology information (NCBI) analyzed using translational tools, 7 of which were deleterious according to SIFT server and were further analyzed using several softwares (Polyhen-2, SNPs&Go, I-Mutant 2.0, Mutpred2, structural analysis soft wares and multiple sequence alignment tool). Four SNPs (rs11557408 (V17M), rs11557409 (R11H), rs367842164 (A66T), and rs376960114 (F57S)) were predicted to be disease causing, localized at highly conservative regions of the SBDS protein and were not reported in any previous study. In addition, the study predicts new functions of the SBDS protein DNA related, and suggests explanations for Patients developing cytopenias and failure to thrive through genetic coexpression and physical interaction with RBF1 and EXOSC3, respectively.",

In contrast, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) do not reveal any signs of cellular aging while in the pluripotency state, whereas little is known how they senesce upon differentiation. Furthermore, it is largely unclear how the metabolome of cells changes during replicative senescence and if such changes are consistent across different cell types. In this study, we have directly compared culture expansion of primary mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and iPSC-derived MSCs (iMSCs) until they reached growth arrest after a mean of 21 and 17 cumulative population doublings, respectively. Both cell types acquired similar changes in morphology, in vitro differentiation potential, up-regulation of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase, and senescence-associated DNA methylation changes. Furthermore, MSCs and iMSCs revealed overlapping gene expression changes during culture expansion, particularly in functional categories related to metabolic processes. We subsequently compared the metabolome of MSCs and iMSCs at early and senescent passages and observed various significant and overlapping senescence-associated changes in both cell types, including down-regulation of nicotinamide ribonucleotide and up-regulation of orotic acid. Replicative senescence of both cell types was consistently reflected by the metabolic switch from oxidative to glycolytic pathways. Taken together, long-term culture of iPSC-derived MSCs evokes very similar molecular and functional changes as observed in primary MSCs. Replicative senescence is associated with a highly reproducible senescence-associated metabolomics phenotype, which may be used to monitor the state of cellular aging.",

    "abstract": "Control of protein intake is essential for numerous biological processes as several amino acids cannot be synthesized de novo, however, its neurobiological substrates are still poorly understood. In the present study, we combined in vivo fiber photometry with nutrient-conditioned flavor in a rat model of protein appetite to record neuronal activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a central brain region for the control of food-related processes. In adult male rats, protein restriction increased preference for casein (protein) over maltodextrin (carbohydrate). Moreover, protein consumption was associated with a greater VTA response relative to carbohydrate. After initial nutrient preference, a switch from a normal balanced diet to protein restriction induced rapid development of protein preference but required extensive exposure to macronutrient solutions to induce greater VTA responses to casein. Furthermore, prior protein restriction induced long-lasting food preference and VTA responses. This study reveals that VTA circuits are involved in protein appetite in times of need, a crucial process for all animals to acquire an adequate amount of protein in their diet.\n\nSignificance StatementAcquiring insufficient protein in ones diet has severe consequences for health and ultimately will lead to death. In addition, a low level of dietary protein has been proposed as a driver of obesity as it can leverage up intake of fat and carbohydrate. However, much remains unknown about the role of the brain in ensuring adequate intake of protein. Here, we show that in a state of protein restriction a key node in brain reward circuitry, the ventral tegmental area, is activated more strongly during consumption of protein than carbohydrate. Moreover, although rats behavior changed to reflect new protein status, patterns of neural activity were more persistent and only loosely linked to protein status.",

    "abstract": "Synapse-associated protein 1 (Syap1) is the mammalian homologue of synapse-associated protein of 47 kDa (Sap47) in Drosophila. Genetic deletion of Sap47 leads to deficiencies in short-term plasticity and associative memory processing in flies. In mice, Syap1 is prominently expressed in the nervous system, but its function is still unclear. We have generated Syap1 knockout mice and tested motor behaviour and memory. These mice are viable and fertile but display distinct deficiencies in motor behaviour. Locomotor activity specifically appears to be reduced in early phases when voluntary movement is initiated. On the rotarod, a more demanding motor test involving control by sensory feedback, Syap1-deficient mice dramatically fail to adapt to accelerated speed or to a change in rotation direction. Syap1 is highly expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells and cerebellar nuclei. Thus, this distinct motor phenotype could be due to a so far unknown function of Syap1 in cerebellar sensorimotor control. The observed motor defects are highly specific since other tests in the modified SHIRPA test, as well as cognitive tasks like novel object recognition, Pavlovian fear conditioning, and anxiety-like behaviour in open field, dark-light transition, and elevated plus maze, do not appear to be strongly affected in Syap1 knockout mice.",

    "abstract": "New tools are needed to match pancreatic cancer patients with effective treatments. Patient-derived organoids offer a high-throughput platform to personalize treatments and discover novel therapies. Currently, methods to evaluate drug response in organoids are limited because they cannot be completed in a clinically relevant time frame, only evaluate response at one time point, and most importantly, overlook cellular heterogeneity. In this study, non-invasive optical metabolic imaging (OMI) of cellular heterogeneity in organoids was evaluated as a predictor of clinical treatment response. Organoids were generated from fresh patient tissue samples acquired during surgery and treated with the same drugs as the patient's prescribed adjuvant treatment. OMI measurements of heterogeneity in response to this treatment were compared to later patient response, specifically to the time to recurrence following surgery. OMI was sensitive to patient-specific treatment response in as little as 24 hours. OMI distinguished subpopulations of cells with divergent and dynamic responses to treatment in living organoids without the use of labels or dyes. OMI of organoids agreed with long-term therapeutic response in patients. With these capabilities, OMI could serve as a sensitive high-throughput tool to identify optimal therapies for individual pancreatic cancer patients, and to develop new effective therapies that address cellular heterogeneity in pancreatic cancer.",

    "abstract": "The ability of adherent cells to form adhesions is critical to several phases of their physiology. The assembly of adhesions is mediated by several types of integrins. These integrins differ in physical properties, including rate of diffusion on the plasma membrane, rapidity of changing conformation from bent to extended, affinity for extracellular matrix ligands, and lifetimes of their ligand-bound states. However, the way in which nanoscale physical properties of integrins ensure proper adhesion assembly remains elusive. We observe experimentally that both beta-1 and beta-3 integrins localize in nascent adhesions at the cell leading edge. In order to understand how different nanoscale parameters of beta-1 and beta-3 integrins mediate proper adhesion assembly, we therefore develop a coarse-grained computational model. Results from the model demonstrate that morphology and distribution of nascent adhesions depend on ligand binding affinity and strength of pairwise interactions. Organization of nascent adhesions depends on the relative amounts of integrins with different bond kinetics. Moreover, the model shows that the architecture of an actin filament network does not perturb the total amount of integrin clustering and ligand binding; however, only bundled actin architectures favor adhesion stability and ultimately maturation. Together, our results support the view that cells can finely tune the expression of different integrin types to determine both structural and dynamic properties of adhesions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMicrocosms such as pitcher plants, or patches of mosses on a rock surface, have been used worldwide to allow for manipulative experiments that test hypotheses for patterns observed at larger extents, such as dispersal or community assemblage. Such microcosms can also be applied to questions in landscape ecology, but are limited by their binary (patch/non-patch structure). Here we examine a more realistic model landscape system that shares the patch-mosaic structure common to kilometres-extent landscapes. This system of lichen thalli on tree trunks has been shown to have consistent spatial patterns across replicate microcosms, but only when sampling within a limited area. To be relevant for experimentation across scales, it is necessary to determine whether previously observed patterns are consistent when sampling across a broader region and when using different tree species. Here, we test for consistent landscape patch pattern in both maco- and micro-lichens across 21 balsam fir (Abies balsamea) and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis) trees.\\n\\nMethodsWe measured spatial pattern of lichen thalli along the trunks of two species of trees, at two spatial resolutions; trees within a single stand ([~]100 x 50 m) and trees dispersed across a larger region (500 km2). We used a \\\"lichen ladder\\\" comprised of 5 10 x 10 cm sampling blocks to quantify number of species and individuals in a 50 cm section of the tree trunk. We tested for similar patterns along the trunk and between the north and south sides at both sampling intensities using perMANOVA.\\n\\nResultsWe find that lichen patches on tree trunks can function as replicate microscoms for landscape ecology. Patterns of thalli along the trunks of trees and between the north and south aspects of the trunk are statistically significantly consistent, although there is variation between tree species, and groups of lichens included. Our microcosm could be used as a model system for landscape ecology research; but researchers should test for consistent patterns first.",

    "abstract": "Slow-wave rhythms characteristic of deep sleep oscillate in the delta band (0.5-4 Hz) and can be found across various brain regions in vertebrates. Across systems it is however unclear how oscillations arise and whether they are the causal functional unit steering behavior. Here, for the first time in any invertebrate, we discover sleep-relevant delta oscillations in Drosophila. We find that slow-wave oscillations in the sleep-regulating R2 network increase with sleep need. Optical multi-unit voltage recordings reveal that single R2 neurons get synchronized by sensory and circadian input pathways. We show that this synchronization depends on NMDA receptor (NMDARs) coincidence detector function and on an interplay of cholinergic and glutamatergic inputs setting a resonance frequency. Genetically targeting the coincidence detector function of NMDARs in R2, and thus the uncovered mechanism underlying synchronization, abolished network-specific slow-wave oscillations. It also disrupted sleep and facilitated light-induced wakening, directly establishing a causal role for slow-wave oscillations in regulating sleep and sensory gating. We therefore propose that the synchronization-based increase in oscillatory power likely represents an evolutionarily conserved, potentially optimal, strategy for constructing sleep-regulating sensory gates.",

Existing segmentation algorithms underperform due to variations in image quality and shape of the breast region. In this paper, we propose to segment breast region by combining data-driven clustering with deformable image registration. In the first phase of the approach, we identify atlas images from a dataset of mammograms using data-driven clustering. Then, we segment these atlas images and use in the next phase of the algorithm. The second phase is atlas-based registration. For a candidate image, we find the most similar atlas image from the set of atlases identified in phase one. We deform the selected atlas image to match the given test image using the Demon's registration algorithm. Then, the segmentation mask of the deformed atlas is transferred to the mammogram in consideration. Finally, we refine the segmentation mask with some morphological operations in order to obtain accurate breast region boundary. We evaluated the performance of our method using ground-truth segmentation masks verified by an expert radiologist. We compared the proposed method with three existing state-of-the-art algorithms for breast region segmentation and the proposed approach outperformed all three in most of the cases.",

    "abstract": "The dynamics of neuronal firing during natural vision are poorly understood. Surprisingly, mean firing rates of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) of freely behaving rodents are similar during prolonged periods of light and darkness, but it is unknown whether this reflects a slow adaptation to changes in natural visual input, or insensitivity to rapid changes in visual drive. Here we use chronic electrophysiology in freely behaving rats of either sex to follow individual V1 neurons across many dark-light (D-L) and light-dark (L-D) transitions. We show that, even on rapid timescales (1s to 10 min), neuronal activity was only weakly modulated by transitions that coincided with the expected 12h/12h light-dark cycle. In contrast, a larger subset of V1 neurons consistently responded to unexpected L-D and D-L transitions, and disruption of the regular L-D cycle with 60 hours of complete darkness induced a robust increase in V1 firing upon re-introduction of visual input. Thus, V1 neurons fire at similar rates in the presence or absence of natural stimuli, and significant changes in activity arise only transiently in response to unexpected changes in the visual environment. Further, although mean rates were similar in L and D, pairwise correlations were significantly stronger during natural vision, suggesting that information about natural scenes in V1 is more readily extractable from correlations than from individual firing rates. Together, our findings show that V1 firing rates are rapidly and actively stabilized during expected changes in visual input, and are remarkably stable at both short and long timescales.",

    "abstract": "The South African ragwort (Senecio inaequidens DC.) is one of the fastest exotic plant invaders in Central Europe but, despite its large distribution area, it is still not commonly found in European grasslands. In order to better understand the mechanisms behind invasion resistance of grassland communities to S. inaequidens, we determined (1) to what extent the timing of arrival of S. inaequidens in the community affected its invasiveness as well as the performance of the native species, and (2) how the direction and strength of priority effects were affected by the composition of the native community being invaded, particularly with regard to the presence of N2-fixing species (legumes). In a greenhouse experiment, we manipulated the timing of arrival of the exotic species in the community and the composition of the native background community to test the influence of these factors on the productivity and N content of exotic and native species. Using a set of interaction indices, we also investigated if the plant species origin (native or exotic) and the native community composition affected the benefit of arriving early and the cost of arriving late (i.e., priority effects) in the community. We showed that both exotic and native species created inhibitory priority effects for late-arriving species. The establishment success of S. inaequidens strongly depended on its timing of arrival in a grassland community. On average, S. inaequidens benefited more from arriving early than the natives. We did not find any evidence to support that the presence of legumes in the background community would favour invasion by S. inaequidens. When natives arrived later than S. inaequidens, however, priority effects were weaker when legumes were present in the native community. Synthesis: we showed that priority effects created by natives can lower the risk of invasion by S. inaequidens and are an important mechanism to explain why this exotic species is not commonly found in European grasslands yet. Our results suggest that an early arrival of this species at a site with low native species abundance (e.g., following a disturbance) is a scenario that could favour invasion by S. inaequidens.",

The contributions, weighting and balancing between the multiple feedback loops remain debated. Dissociated, free-running dynamics in the expression of distinct clock genes has been described in recent experimental studies that applied various perturbations such as slice preparations, light pulses, jet-lag, and culture medium exchange. In this paper, we provide evidence that this \\\"presumably transient\\\" dissociation of circadian gene expression oscillations may occur at the single-cell level. Conceptual and detailed mechanistic mathematical modeling suggests that such dissociation is due to a weak interaction between multiple feedback loops present within a single cell. The dissociable loops provide insights into underlying mechanisms and general design principles of the molecular circadian clock.",

    "abstract": "Background: Mass Spectrometry (MS) is a widely used technique in biology research, and has become key in proteomics and metabolomics analyses. As a result, the amount of MS data has significantly increased in recent years. For example, the MS repository MassIVE contains more than 123TB of data. Somehow surprisingly, these data are stored uncompressed, hence incurring a significant storage cost. Efficient representation of these data is therefore paramount to lessen the burden of storage and facilitate its dissemination. Results We present MassComp, a lossless compressor optimized for the numerical (m/z)-intensity pairs that account for most of the MS data. We tested MassComp on several MS data and show that it delivers on average a 46% reduction on the size of the numerical data, and up to 89%. These results correspond to an average improvement of more than 27% when compared to the general compressor gzip and of 40% when compared to the state-of-the-art numerical compressor FPC. When tested on entire files retrieved from the MassIVE repository, MassComp achieves on average a 59% size reduction. MassComp is written in C++ and freely available at https://github.com/iochoa/MassComp. Conclusions: The compression performance of MassComp demonstrates its potential to significantly reduce the footprint of MS data, and shows the benefits of designing specialized compression algorithms tailored to MS data. MassComp is an addition to the family of omics compression algorithms designed to lessen the storage burden and facilitate the exchange and dissemination of omics data.",

    "abstract": "Affective disorders such as major depression are common but serious illnesses characterized by altered processing of emotional information. Although the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms increase dramatically over the course of childhood and adolescence, much of our understanding of their neurobiological bases comes from work characterizing adults responses to static emotional information. As a consequence, relationships between depressive brain phenotypes and naturalistic emotional processing, as well as the manner in which these associations emerge over the lifespan, remain poorly understood. Here, we apply static and dynamic inter-subject correlation analyses to examine how brain function is associated with clinical and non-clinical depressive symptom severity in 112 children and adolescents (7-21 years old) who viewed an emotionally evocative clip from the film Despicable Me during functional MRI. Our results reveal that adolescents with greater depressive symptom severity exhibit atypical fMRI responses during movie viewing, and that this effect is stronger during less emotional moments of the movie. Furthermore, adolescents with more similar item-level depressive symptom profiles showed more similar brain responses during movie viewing. In contrast, childrens depressive symptom severity and profiles were unrelated to their brain response typicality or similarity. Together, these results indicate a developmental change in the relationships between brain function and depressive symptoms from childhood through adolescence. Our findings suggest that depressive symptoms may shape how the brain responds to complex emotional information in a dynamic manner sensitive to both developmental stage and affective context.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been proposed as signaling molecules mediating exercise training adaptation, but the ROS source has remained unclear. This study aimed to investigate the requirement for NADPH oxidase (NOX)2-dependent redox changes induced by acute and long-term high-intensity interval training (HIIT) in skeletal muscle in a mouse model lacking functional NOX2 complex due to deficient p47phox (Ncf1) subunit expression (ncf1* mutation). Methods: HIIT was investigated after an acute bout of exercise and after a chronic intervention (3x week for 6 weeks) in wildtype (WT) vs. NOX2 activity-deficient (ncf1*) mice. NOX2 activation during HIIT was measured using a genetically-encoded biosensor. Immunoblotting and single-fiber staining were performed to measure classical exercise-training responsive endpoints in skeletal muscle. Results: A single bout of HIIT increased NOX2 activity measured using electroporated p47roGFP oxidation immediately after exercise but not 1h after exercise. After a 6-week of HIIT regime, improvements in maximal running capacity and some muscle training-markers responded less to HIIT in the ncf1* mice compared to WT, including superoxide dismutase (SOD)2, catalase, hexokinase II (HK II), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and protein markers of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complexes. Strikingly, HIIT-training increased mitochondrial network area and decreased fragmentation in WT mice only. Conclusion: This study provided evidence that HIIT exercise activates NOX2 complex in skeletal muscle and that the presence of functional NOX2 is required for specific skeletal muscle adaptations to HIIT relating to antioxidant defense, glucose metabolism, and mitochondria.",

    "abstract": "This paper aims at presenting HydroShoot, a functional-structural plant model (FSPM) that is developed to simulate gas-exchange rates of complex plant canopies under water deficit conditions, by scaling up gas-exchange rates from the leaf to the canopy levels. The main hypothesis is that simulating both the hydraulic structure of the shoot together with the energy budget of individual leaves is the asset for successfully achieving this up-scaling task. HydroShoot was hence built as the ensemble of three interacting modules: hydraulic which calculates the distribution of xylem water potential across shoot hydraulic segments, energy which calculates the complete energy budget of individual leaves, and exchange which calculates net assimilation and transpiration rates of individual leaves. HydroShoot was coupled with irradiance interception and soil water balance models, and was evaluated on virtual and real grapevines having strongly contrasted canopies, under well-watered and water-deficit conditions. HydroShoot captured accurately the impact of canopy architecture and the varying soil water deficit conditions on plant-scale gas-exchange rates and leaf-scale temperature and water potential distributions. Both shoot hydraulic structure and leaf energy budget simulations were, as postulated, required to adequately scaling-up leaf to canopy gas-exchange rates. Notwithstanding, simulating the hydraulic structure of the shoot was found far more necessary to adequately performing this scaling task than simulating leaf energy balance. That is, the intra-canopy variability of leaf water potential was a better predictor of the reduction of whole plant gas-exchange rates under water deficit than the intra-canopy variability of leaf temperature. We conclude therefore that simulating the shoot hydraulic structure is a prerequisite if FSPM's are to be used to assess gas-exchange rates of complex plant canopies as those of grapevines. Finally HydroShoot is available through the OpenAlea platform (https://github.com/openalea/hydroshoot) as a set of reusable modules.",

In this model, a decision variable keeps track of the integrated difference in sensory evidence for two competing alternatives. Here I extend the notion of a drift-diffusion process to multiple alternatives. The competition between n alternatives takes place in a linear subspace of n-1 dimensions; that is, there are n-1 decision variables, which are coupled through correlated noise sources. I derive the multiple-alternative DDM starting from a system of coupled, linear firing rate equations. If the original neuronal system is nonlinear, one can once again derive a model describing a lower dimensional diffusion process. The dynamics of the nonlinear DDM can be recast as the motion of a particle on a potential, the general form of which is given analytically for an arbitrary number of alternatives.",

Furthermore, the theory takes into account correlations in the in-degree and out-degree of neurons, which would arise e.g. in the case of networks with hub-like neurons. Finally, we show that networks with broad and postively correlated degrees can generate a large-amplitude sustained response to transient stimuli which does not occur in more homogeneous networks.",

    "abstract": "CD81 plays a central role in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. Recent structural analysis of CD81 indicates that it contains an intramembrane cholesterol-binding pocket and that interaction with cholesterol may regulate a conformational opening of the large extracellular domain of CD81. Therefore, CD81 possesses a potential cholesterol sensing mechanism; however, the relevance of this for protein function is thus far unknown. In this study we investigate CD81 cholesterol sensing in the context of its activity as a receptor for hepatitis C virus (HCV). Structure-led mutagenesis of the cholesterol-binding pocket reduced CD81-cholesterol association, but had disparate effects on HCV entry, both reducing and enhancing CD81 receptor activity. We reasoned that this could be explained by alterations in the consequences of cholesterol binding. To investigate this further we performed molecular dynamic simulations of CD81 with and without cholesterol; this identified a potential allosteric mechanism by which cholesterol binding regulates the conformation of CD81. To test this, we designed further mutations to force CD81 into either the open (cholesterol unbound) or closed (cholesterol bound) conformation. The open mutant of CD81 exhibited reduced receptor activity whereas the closed mutant enhanced activity. These data are consistent with CD81 cholesterol sensing resulting in a switch between a receptor active and inactive state. CD81 interactome analysis also suggests that conformational switching may modulate the assembly of CD81-partner protein networks. This work furthers our understanding of the molecular mechanism of CD81 cholesterol sensing, how this relates to HCV entry and CD81s function as a molecular scaffold; these insights are relevant to CD81s varied roles in both health and disease.",

    "abstract": "We have previously described hypomorphic reelin (Reln) mutant mice, RelnCTRdel, in which the morphology of the dentate gyrus is distinct from that seen in reeler mice. In the RelnCTRdel mutant the infrapyramidal blade of the dentate gyrus fails to extend, while the suprapyramidal blade forms with a relatively compact granule neuron layer. The distribution of Cajal-Retzius cells in the dentate gyrus was aberrant; Cajal-Retzius neurons were increased in the suprapyramidal blade, but were greatly reduced along the subpial surface of the prospective infrapyramidal blade. We also observed multiple abnormalities of the fimbriodentate junction. Firstly, progenitor cells were distributed abnormally; the neurogenic cluster at the fimbriodentate junction was absent, lacking the normal accumulation of Tbr2-positive intermediate progenitors. However, the number of dividing cells in the dentate gyrus was not generally decreased. Secondly, a defect of secondary glial scaffold formation, limited to the infrapyramidal blade, was observed. The densely radiating glial fibers characteristic of the normal fimbriodentate junction were absent in mutants. These fibers might be required for migration of progenitors, which may account for the failure of neurogenic cluster formation. These findings suggest the importance of the secondary scaffold and neurogenic cluster of the fimbriodentate junction in morphogenesis of the mammalian dentate gyrus. Our study provides direct genetic evidence showing that normal RELN function is required for Cajal-Retzius cell positioning in the dentate gyrus, and for formation of the fimbriodentate junction to promote infrapyramidal blade extension.",

While R-CHOP cures 60% of the patients with DLBCL, those who do not respond or relapse have dismal prognosis, and effective treatment strategies are needed. Due to the plastic nature of the epigenome and its fundamental role in regulating cell identity, we hypothesized that reprogramming the epigenome can overcome resistance to R-CHOP. We developed a novel drug screening protocol to identify epigenetic modifiers that sensitize DLBCL cell lines to immunochemotherapy. Of the herein tested 60 epigenetic compounds, we identified several histone deacetylase (HDAC) and histone methyltransferase (HMT) inhibitors that acted synergistically with immunochemotherapy. We show that sensitization through HDAC and HMT inhibitors is achieved by dysregulating homologous recombination, a central DNA repair pathway, as well as by disrupting the cell cycle and affecting the apoptotic pathway. Epigenetic inhibitors are well-tolerated, which together with our findings support their use in combination with immunochemotherapy in patients with primary refractory and relapsed DLBCL.",

While C. albicans is predominatly diploid, it can tolerate aneuploidy as a survival strategy under stress. Aurora kinase B homolog Ipl1 is a critical ploidy regulator that controls microtubule dynamics and chromosome segregation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this study, we show that Ipl1 in C. albicans has a longer activation loop than that of the well-studied ascomycete S. cerevisiae. Ipl1 localizes to the kinetochores during the G1/S phase and associates with the spindle during mitosis. Ipl1 regulates cell morphogenesis and is required for cell viability. Ipl1 monitors microtubule dynamics which is mediated by separation of spindle pole bodies. While Ipl1 is dispensable for maintaining structural integrity and clustering of kinetochores in C. albicans, it is required for the maintenance of kinetochore geometry to form bilobed structures along the mitotic spindle, a feature of Ipl1 that was not observed in other yeasts. Depletion of Ipl1 results in erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachments leading to aneuploidy-associated resistance to fluconazole, the most common anti-fungal drug used to treat Candida infections. Taking together, we suggest that Ipl1 spatiotemporally ensures kinetochore geometry to facilitate bipolar spindle assembly crucial for ploidy maintenance in C. albicans.",

Treatments included slash only (SO), slash +burn (SB), slash+ ridge (SR) and herbicide (glyphosate) application (HA) at the recommended rate of 2 L/ha-1. Results from the statistical analysis of data from this study showed inconsistent trends of tillage treatments on soil physical properties. However, slash +burn (SB) tillage significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced chemical properties such as the soil pH, available P, exchangeable K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ compared to their respective values before treatment application in the two years under study. Amongst the treatments, slash + burn (SB) tillage further exerted the most significant (P [&le;] 0.05) effect on urease, L-asparaginase, L-glutaminase, dehydrogenase, acid and alkaline phosphatase activities, but recorded the least values for amidase and {beta}-glucosidase activities in soil. Results from this study therefore, suggest that SB tillage treatment was beneficial to the soil environment as it has proven to be more promising and effective for enhancing the selected soil quality indicators on the soil type due to quick mineralization and release of bound nutrients present in the soil and litter.",

    "abstract": "The Ngorongoro Crater is an intact caldera with an area of approximately 310 km2. Long term records on herbivore populations, vegetation and rainfall made it possible to analyze historic and project future herbivore population dynamics. In 1974 there was a perturbation in that resident Maasai and their livestock were removed from the Crater. Vegetation structure changed in 1967 from predominately short grassland to mid and tall grasses dominating in 1995. Even with a change in grassland structure, total herbivore biomass remained relatively stable from 1963 to 2012, implying that the crater has a stable multi-herbivore community. However, in 1974, Maasai pastoralists were removed from the Ngorongoro Crater and there were significant changes in population trends for some herbivore species. Buffalo, elephant and ostrich numbers increased significantly during 1974-2012. The zebra population was stable from 1963 to 2012 whereas numbers of other eight species declined substantially between 1974 and 2012 relative to their peak numbers during 1974-1976. Numbers of Grants and Thomsons gazelles, eland, kongoni, waterbuck (wet season only) declined significantly in the Crater in both seasons after 1974. Wildebeest numbers decreased in the Crater between 1974 and 2012 but this decrease was not statistically significant. In addition, some herbivore species were consistently more abundant inside the Crater during the wet than the dry season. This pattern was most evident for the large herbivore species requiring bulk forage, comprising buffalo, eland, and elephant. Analyses of rainfall indicated that there was a persistent annual cycle of 4.83 years. Herbivore population size was correlated with rainfall in both the wet and dry seasons. The relationships established between the time series of historic animal counts in the wet and dry seasons and lagged wet and dry season rainfall series were used to forecast the likely future trajectories of the wet and dry season population size for each species under three alternative climate change scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Background Worldwide, snakebite envenomations total ~2.7 million reported cases annually with ~100,000 fatalities. Since 2009, snakebite envenomation has been classified as a very important  neglected tropical disease by the World Health Organisation. Despite this emerging awareness, limited efforts have been geared towards addressing the serious public health implications of snakebites, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where baseline epidemiological data remain incomplete. Due to poverty as well as limited infrastructure and public health facilities, people in rural Africa, including Ghana, often have no other choice than to seek treatment from traditional medical practitioners (TMP). The African  snakebite crisis is highlighted here using extensive complementary data from a community-based epidemiological study conducted by snake ecologists in the savanna zone of northern Ghana. Methodology and findings Our cross-sectional study included 1,000 residents and 24 TMPs in the Savelugu-Nanton District in northern Ghana between December 2008 and May 2009, and a 10-year (1999-2008) retrospective snakebite data from the district hospital. Variables tested included demography, human activity patterns, seasonality, snake ecology and clinical reports. Complementary data showed higher snakebite prevalence during the rainy season, and a hump-shaped correlation between rainfall intensity and snakebite incidences. Almost 6% of respondents had experienced a personal snakebite, whereas ~60% of respondents had witnessed a total of 799 snakebite cases. Out of a total of 857 reported snakebite cases, 24 (~2.8%) died. Highest snakebite prevalence was recorded for males in the age group 15-44 years during farming activities, with most bites occurring in the leg/foot region. Highest snakebite rate was within farmlands, most frequently caused by the Carpet viper (Echis ocellatus). Conclusion The relatively high community-based prevalence rate of ~6%, and fatality rate of ~3%, indicate that snakebites represent an important public health risk in northern Ghana. Based on the high number of respondents and long recording period, we believe these data truly reflect the general situation in rural Ghana and West Africa at large. We recommend increased efforts from both local and international health authorities to address the current snakebite health crisis generally compromising livelihoods and productivity of rural farming communities in West Africa.",

    "abstract": "Mathematical reasoning is central to everyday life. Lesion data and functional MRI studies suggest that even simple arithmetic involves the coordination of multiple spatially diverse brain regions, but to date, math processing has not been well characterized using direct brain recordings, especially outside of the parietal cortex. To address this, we utilized an unparalleled data set of 310 subjects implanted with intracranial electrodes to investigate the spatial and temporal dynamics of arithmetic reasoning. Our data support the importance of regions previously implicated in numerosity such as the superior parietal lobule and intraparietal sulcus. However, we also identify contributions to arithmetic processing from regions such as the entorhinal cortex and temporal pole. Using the excellent bihemispheric coverage afforded by our data set and the precise temporal resolution of intracranial recordings, we characterize in detail the spatial and temporal characteristics of an arithmetic processing network, quantifying subtle hemispheric differences for selected regions. We also examine how activity in these regions predicts arithmetic ability and look for gender differences in the pattern of network activation. Our findings further define the complex network of regions involved in human arithmetical reasoning.",

    "abstract": "Physical activity (PA) has preventive and possibly restorative effects in aging-related cognitive decline, which relate to intrinsic functional interactions (functional connectivity, FC) in large-scale brain networks. Preventive and ameliorative effects of PA on cognitive decline have also been documented in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the neural substrates that mediate the association between PA and cognitive performance under such neurological conditions remain unknown. Here we set out to examine if the association between PA and cognitive performance in PD is mediated by FC in large-scale sensorimotor and association brain networks. Data from 51 PD patients were analyzed. Connectome-level analysis based on a whole-brain parcellation showed that self-reported levels of PA were associated with increased FC between, but not within the default mode (DMN) and salience networks (SAL) (p < .05, false discovery rate corrected). Additionally, multiple parallel mediation analysis further demonstrated that FC between left lateral parietal nodes in the DMN and rostral prefrontal nodes in the SAL mediated the association between PA and executive function performance. These findings are in line with previous studies linking FC in large-scale association networks with the effects of PA on cognition in healthy aging. Our results extend these previous results by demonstrating that the association between PA and cognitive performance in neurodegenerative diseases such as PD is mediated by integrative functional interactions in large-scale association networks.",

    "abstract": "During mitosis, the centrosome expands its capacity to nucleate microtubules. Understanding the mechanisms of centrosomal microtubule nucleation is, however, constrained by a lack of knowledge of the amount of soluble and polymer tubulin at mitotic centrosomes. Here we combined light microscopy and serial-section electron tomography to measure the amount of dimer and polymer at mitotic centrosomes in early C. elegans embryos. We show that a C. elegans one-cell stage centrosome at metaphase contains more than ten thousand microtubules with a total polymer concentration of 230 M. Centrosomes concentrate soluble /{beta} tubulin by about tenfold over the cytoplasm, reaching peak values of 470 M, giving a combined total monomer and polymer tubulin concentration at centrosomes of up to 660 M. These findings support in vitro data suggesting that microtubule nucleation in C. elegans centrosomes is driven in part by concentrating soluble tubulin.",

    "abstract": "F1Fo-ATP synthases play a central role in cellular metabolism, making the energy of the proton-motive force across a membrane available for a large number of energy-consuming processes. We determined the single-particle cryo-EM structure of active dimeric ATP synthase from mitochondria of Polytomella sp. at 2.7- 2.8 [A] resolution. Separation of 13 well-defined rotary substates by 3D classification provides a detailed picture of the molecular motions that accompany c-ring rotation and result in ATP synthesis. Crucially, the F1 head rotates along with the central stalk and c-ring rotor for the first ~30{degrees} of each 120{degrees} primary rotary step. The joint movement facilitates flexible coupling of the stoichiometrically mismatched F1 and Fo subcomplexes. Flexibility is mediated primarily by the interdomain hinge of the conserved OSCP subunit, a well-established target of physiologically important inhibitors. Our maps provide atomic detail of the c-ring/a-subunit interface in the membrane, where protonation and deprotonation of c-ring cGlu111 drives rotary catalysis. An essential histidine residue in the lumenal proton access channel binds a strong non-peptide density assigned to a metal ion that may facilitate c-ring protonation, as its coordination geometry changes with c-ring rotation. We resolve ordered water molecules in the proton access and release channels and at the gating aArg239 that is critical in all rotary ATPases. We identify the previously unknown ASA10 subunit and present complete de novo atomic models of subunits ASA1-10, which make up the two interlinked peripheral stalks that stabilize the Polytomella ATP synthase dimer.",
