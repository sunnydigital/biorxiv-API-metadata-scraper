    "abstract": "Prenatal Alcohol exposure (PAE), like other pregnancy complications, can result in placental insufficiency and fetal growth restriction, though the linking causal mechanisms are unclear. We previously identified 11 gestationally-elevated maternal circulating miRNAs that predicted infant growth deficits following PAE. Here, we investigated whether these HEamiRNAs contribute to the pathology of PAE, by inhibiting trophoblast epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a pathway critical for placental development. We now report for the first time, that PAE inhibits expression of placental pro-EMT pathway members in both rodents and primates, and that HEamiRNAs collectively, but not individually, mediate placental EMT inhibition. HEamiRNAs collectively, but not individually, also inhibited cell proliferation and the EMT pathway in cultured trophoblasts, while inducing cell stress, and following trophoblast syncytialization, aberrant endocrine maturation. Moreover, a single intra-vascular administration of the pooled murine-expressed HEamiRNAs, to pregnant mice, decreased placental and fetal growth and inhibited expression of pro-EMT transcripts in placenta. Our data suggests that HEamiRNAs collectively interfere with placental development, contributing to the pathology of PAE, and perhaps also, to other causes of fetal growth restriction.\n\nSummaryMaternal gestational circulating microRNAs, predictive of adverse infant outcomes including growth deficits, following prenatal alcohol exposure, contribute to placental pathology by impairing the EMT pathway in trophoblasts.",

    "abstract": "Although the cellular and molecular responses to exposure to relatively high temperatures (acute thermal stress or heat shock) have been studied previously, only sparse empirical evidence of how it affects cold-water species is available. As climate change becomes more pronounced in areas such as the Western Antarctic Peninsula, it has become crucial to understand the capacity of these species to respond to thermal stress.\n\nHere we use the Antarctic sponge Isodictya sp. to investigate how sessile organisms (particularly Porifera) can adjust to acute short-term heat stress, by exposing this species to 3 and 5 {degrees}C for 4 hours, corresponding to predicted temperatures under high-end 2080 IPCC-SRES scenarios. Assembling a de novo reference transcriptome (90,188 contigs, >93.7% metazoan BUSCO genes) we have begun to discern the molecular componentry employed by Isodictya to adjust to environmental insult.\n\nOur initial analyses suggest that TGF-{beta}, ubiquitin and hedgehog cascades are involved, alongside other genes. However, the degree and type of response changed little from 3 to 5 {degrees}C, suggesting that even moderate rises in temperature could cause stress at the limits of this organisms capacity. Given the importance of sponges to Antarctic ecosystems, our findings are vital for discerning the consequences of increases in Antarctic ocean temperature on these and other species.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) lack well-defined three-dimensional structures, thus challenging the archetypal notion of structure-function relationships. Determining the ensemble of conformations that IDPs explore under physiological conditions is the first step towards understanding their diverse cellular functions. Here, we quantitatively characterize the structural features of IDPs as a function of sequence and length using coarse-grained simulations. For diverse IDP sequences, with the number of residues (NT) ranging from 24 to 441, our simulations not only reproduce the radii of gyration (Rg) obtained from experiments, but also predict the full scattering intensity profiles in very good agreement with Small Angle X-ray Scattering experiments. The Rg values are well-described by the standard Flory scaling law, [Formula], with v {approx} 0.588, making it tempting to assert that IDPs behave as polymers in a good solvent. However, clustering analysis reveals that the menagerie of structures explored by IDPs is diverse, with the extent of heterogeneity being highly sequence-dependent, even though ensemble-averaged properties, such as the dependence of Rg on chain length, may suggest synthetic polymer-like behavior in a good solvent. For example, we show that for the highly charged Prothymosin-, a substantial fraction of conformations is highly compact. Even if the sequence compositions are similar, as is the case for -Synuclein and a truncated construct from the Tau protein, there are substantial differences in the conformational heterogeneity. Taken together, these observations imply that metrics based on net charge or related quantities alone, cannot be used to anticipate the phases of IDPs, either in isolation or in complex with partner IDPs or RNA. Our work sets the stage for probing the interactions of IDPs with each other, with folded protein domains, or with partner RNAs, which are critical for describing the structures of stress granules and biomolecular condensates with important cellular functions.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=82 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/427476v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (12K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b50bd9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11cf542org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@29ebb5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@31e965_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical TOC Entry C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Genomic identification of driver mutations and genes in cancer cells are critical for precision medicine. Due to difficulty in modeling distribution of background mutations, existing statistical methods are often underpowered to discriminate driver genes from passenger genes. Here we propose a novel statistical approach, weighted iterative zero-truncated negative-binomial regression (WITER), to detect cancer-driver genes showing an excess of somatic mutations. By solving the problem of inaccurately modeling background mutations, this approach works even in small or moderate samples. Compared to alternative methods, it detected more significant and cancer-consensus genes in all tested cancers. Applying this approach, we estimated 178 driver genes in 26 different cancers types. In silico validation confirmed 90.5% of predicted genes as likely known drivers and 7 genes unique for individual cancers as likely new drivers. The technical advances of WITER enable the detection of driver genes in TCGA datasets as small as 30 subjects, rescuing more genes missed by alternative tools.",

    "abstract": "Species delimitation is at the core of biological sciences. During the last decade, molecular-based approaches have advanced the field by providing additional sources of evidence to classical, morphology-based taxonomy. However, taxonomy has not yet fully embraced molecular species delimitation beyond threshold-based, single-gene approaches, and taxonomic knowledge is not commonly integrated to multi-locus species delimitation models. Here we aim to bridge empirical data (taxonomic and genetic) with recently developed coalescent-based species delimitation approaches. We use the multispecies coalescent model as implemented in two Bayesian methods (DISSECT/STACEY and BP&P) to infer species hypotheses. In both cases, we account for phylogenetic uncertainty (by not using any guide tree) and taxonomic uncertainty (by measuring the impact of using or not a priori taxonomic assignment to specimens). We focus on an entire Neotropical tribe of butterflies, the Haeterini (Nymphalidae: Satyrinae). We contrast divergent taxonomic opinion--splitting, lumping and misclassifying species--in the light of different phenotypic classifications proposed to date. Our results provide a solid background for the recognition of 22 species. The synergistic approach presented here overcomes limitations in both traditional taxonomy (e.g. by recognizing cryptic species) and molecular-based methods (e.g. by recognizing structured populations, and not raise them to species). Our framework provides a step forward towards standardization and increasing reproducibility of species delimitations.",

The data from scATAC-seq are unique sparse, binary, and highly variable even within the same cell type. As such, neither methods developed for bulk ATAC-seq nor single-cell RNA-seq data are appropriate. Here, we present Destin, a bioinformatic and statistical framework for comprehensive scATAC-seq data analysis. Destin performs cell-type clustering via weighted principle component analysis, weighting accessible chromatin regions by existing genomic annotations and publicly available regulomic data sets. The weights and additional tuning parameters are determined via model-based likelihood. We evaluated the performance of Destin using downsampled bulk ATAC-seq data of purified samples and scATAC-seq data from seven diverse experiments. Compared to existing methods, Destin was shown to outperform across all data sets and platforms. For demonstration, we further applied Destin to 2,088 adult mouse forebrain cells and identified cell type-specific association of previously reported schizophrenia GWAS loci.\n\nAvailabilityDestin toolkit is freely available as an R package at https://github.com/urrutiag/destin.\n\nContactyuchaoj@email.unc.edu.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAbout 74% of the Sri Lankan population use biomass in the form of unprocessed wood as the primary cooking fuel. A growing body of evidence from meta-analyses and individual studies although limited by few prospective studies, report that prenatal exposure to particulate matter of size 2.5 {micro}m (PM2.5) emissions from biomass fuel burning may be associated with low birth weight (LBW) (<2500 grams). We present results examining the association between PM2.5 and LBW in context of a birth cohort study in Sri Lanka.\n\nMethodsWe followed 545 pregnant women from their first trimester until delivery and assessed outcomes at birth. Exposure to household air pollution (HAP) from biomass smoke was assessed using detailed questionnaire about fuel type, kitchen characteristics and cooking practices; two-hour measurements of kitchen PM2.5 were collected in a subset of households (n=304, 56%). Data from questionnaires and measured PM2.5 were used to estimate two-hour kitchen PM2.5 concentrations in unmeasured households. Data on covariates related to household characteristics, socio-demographic, maternal health and lifestyle factors were collected from baseline interviews. We performed linear and logistic regression analysis to evaluate the association between HAP exposure, and birth weight and LBW.\n\nResultsOf the total, 78% of the households used wood as primary or secondary fuel (n=425); households using wood had four-fold higher PM2.5 levels compared to those using LPG. In linear regression models, we found an inverse association between a 10-unit increase in PM2.5 and birth weight ({beta},-0.03; SE, 0.02; p, 0.06) adjusted for covariates. Similarly, categorical HAP exposure (>50% wood use) was significantly associated with birth weight as compared to LPG users ({beta}, -0.13; SE, 0.06; p, 0.0331). In logistic regression models, a 10-unit increase in PM2.5 was associated with increased odds for LBW (OR, 1.26; 95%CI, 1.02-1.55; p, 0.0355), while the prevalence of LBW was highest among >50% wood users (OR, 2.82; 95%CI, 1.18-6.73; p, 0.0124), as compared to those using >50% LPG with wood and only LPG users. The association between HAP exposure and birth weight/LBW were consistent among term births (n=486).\n\nConclusionsThe finding of a significant association between prenatal PM2.5 exposure and LBW in a low-middle income country (LMIC) setting where competing risk factors are minimal fills a gap in the body of evidence linking HAP from biomass smoke to LBW. These results underscore the crucial need to implement prevention and reduction of HAP exposure in LMICs where the HAP burden is high.",

When these features change, the listener should recalibrate its internal model by appropriately weighing new versus old evidence in a volatility dependent manner. Models of speech recalibration have classically ignored volatility. Those that explicitly consider volatility have been designed to describe human behavior in tasks where sensory cues are associated with arbitrary experimenter-defined categories or rewards. In such settings, a model that maintains a single representation of the category but continuously adapts the learning rate works well. Using neurocomputational modelling we show that recalibration of existing \"natural\" categories is better described when sound categories are represented at different time scales. We illustrate our proposal by modeling the rapid recalibration of speech categories (Luttke et al. 2016).",

We used a custom-built  cell squasher to apply uniaxial pressure to Dictyostelium cells migrating under soft agarose. Within 10 seconds of application, loads of as little as 100 Pa cause cells to move using blebs instead of pseudopods. Cells lose volume and surface area under pressure and their actin dynamics are perturbed. Myosin-II is recruited to the cortex, potentially increasing contractility and so driving blebbing. The blebbing response depends on extra-cellular calcium, is accompanied by increased cytosolic calcium and largely abrogated in null mutants of the Piezo stretch-operated channel. We propose that migrating cells sense mechanical force through mechano-sensitive channels, leading to an influx of calcium and cortical recruitment of myosin, thus re-directing the motile apparatus to produce blebs rather than pseudopods.",

Here, using zebrafish tnfa:GFP transgenic lines as in vivo readouts of M1 macrophages, we show that hypoxia and stabilisation of Hif-1 polarises macrophages to a tnfa expressing phenotype. We demonstrate a novel mechanism of Hif-1 mediated macrophage tnfa upregulation via a cyclooxygenase/prostaglandin E2 axis, a mechanism that is conserved in human primary macrophages. These findings uncover a novel macrophage HIF/COX/TNF axis that links microenvironmental cues to macrophage phenotype that may have implications in inflammation, infection and cancer, where hypoxia is a common microenvironmental feature and where cyclooxygenase and Tnfa are major mechanistic players.",

    "abstract": "Strigolactones (SLs) are endogenous signalling molecules that play important roles in controlling plant development. SL perception is closely related to that of karrikins, smoke-derived compounds presumed to mimic endogenous signalling molecules (KLs). SLs have been suggested to regulate root development. However, perception of both molecules requires the F-box protein MAX2 and the use of max2 mutants has hampered defining the exact role of SLs in roots. Here we dissect the role of SL and KL signalling in Arabidopsis root development using mutants defective in the /{beta} hydrolase receptors D14 and KAI2, which specifically perceive SLs and KLs, respectively. Both pathways together regulate lateral root density (LRD), but contrary to previous reports, KL signalling alone controls root hair density, root hair length and additionally root skewing, straightness and diameter. Members of the SMXL protein family are downstream targets of SL (SMXL6, 7, 8) and KL (SMAX1, SMXL2) signalling. We identified distinct and overlapping roles of these proteins in the regulation of root development. Both SMAX1/SMXL2 and SMXL6/SMXL7/SMXL8 regulate LRD, confirming that SL and KL signalling act together to regulate this trait, while the KL-signalling specific SMAX1 and SMXL2 regulate all other investigated root traits. Finally, we show that KL signalling regulates root hair development by modulating auxin distribution within the root.",

    "abstract": "Microbial production of biofuels and bioproducts offers a sustainable and economic alternative to petroleum-based fuels and chemicals. The basidiomycete yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides is a promising platform organism for generating bioproducts due to its ability to consume a broad spectrum of carbon sources (including those derived from lignocellulosic biomass) and to naturally accumulate high levels of lipids and carotenoids, two biosynthetic pathways that can be leveraged to produce a wide range of bioproducts. While R. toruloides has great potential, it has a more limited set of tools for genetic engineering relative to more advanced yeast platform organisms such as Yarrowia lipolytica and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Significant advancements in the past few years have bolstered R. toruloides engineering capacity. Here we expand this capacity by demonstrating the first use of CRISPR-Cas9 based gene disruption in R. toruloides. Stably integrating a Cas9 expression cassette into the genome brought about successful targeted disruption of the native URA3 gene. While editing efficiencies were initially low (0.002%), optimization of the cassette increased efficiencies 364-fold (to 0.6%). Applying these optimized design conditions enabled disruption of another native gene involved in carotenoid biosynthesis, CAR2, with much greater success; editing efficiencies of CAR2 deletion reached roughly 50%. Finally, we demonstrated efficient multiplexed genome editing by disrupting both CAR2 and URA3 in a single transformation. Together, our results provide a framework for applying CRISPR-Cas9 to R. toruloides that will facilitate rapid and high throughput genome engineering in this industrially relevant organism.\n\nIMPORTANCEMicrobial biofuel and bioproduct platforms provide access to clean and renewable carbon sources that are more sustainable and environmentally friendly than petroleum-based carbon sources. Furthermore, they can serve as useful conduits for the synthesis of advanced molecules that are difficult to produce through strictly chemical means. R. toruloides has emerged as a promising potential host for converting renewable lignocellulosic material into valuable fuels and chemicals. However, engineering efforts to improve the yeasts production capabilities have been impeded by a lack of advanced tools for genome engineering. While this is rapidly changing, one key tool remains unexplored in R. toruloides; CRISPR-Cas9. The results outlined here demonstrate for the first time how effective multiplexed CRISPR-Cas9 gene disruption provides a framework for other researchers to utilize this revolutionary genome-editing tool effectively in R. toruloides.",

    "abstract": "SummaryGenome rearrangements occur in bacteria between repeat sequences and impact growth and gene expression. Homologous recombination can occur between ribosomal operons, which are found in multiple copies in many bacteria. Inversion between indirect repeats and excision/translocation between direct repeats enable structural genome rearrangement. To identify what these rearrangements are by sequencing, reads of several thousand bases are required to span the ribosomal operons. With long read sequencing aiding the routine generation of complete bacterial assemblies, we have developed socru, a typing method for the order and orientation of genome fragments between ribosomal operons, defined against species-specific baselines. It allows for a single identifier to convey the order and orientation of genome level structure and 434 of the most common bacterial species are supported. Additionally, socru can be used to identify large scale misassemblies.\n\nAvailability and implementationSocru is written in Python 3, runs on Linux and OSX systems and is available under the open source license GNU GPL 3 from https://github.com/quadram-institute-bioscience/socru.\n\nContactgemma.langridge@quadram.ac.uk",

    "abstract": "The biological roles of the intestinal microbiome and how it is impacted by environmental factors are yet to be determined in wild marine fish species. Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) is an ecologically important species with a wide-spread distribution in the North Atlantic Ocean. 16S rRNA-based amplicon analyses found no geographical differentiation between the intestinal microbiome of Atlantic cod from different locations. Nevertheless, it is unclear if this lack of differentiation results from an insufficient resolution of this method to resolve fine-scaled biological complexity. Here, we take advantage of the increased resolution provided by metagenomic shotgun sequencing to investigate the intestinal microbiome of 19 adult Atlantic cod individuals from two coastal populations in Norway - located 470 km apart. Our results show that the intestinal microbiome is dominated by the Vibrionales order, consisting of varying abundances of Photobacterium, Aliivibrio and Vibrio species. Moreover, resolving the species community to unprecedented resolution, we identify two abundant species, P. iliopiscarium and P. kishitanii, which comprise over 50% of the classified reads. Interestingly, genomic data shows that the intestinal P. kishitanii strains have functionally intact lux genes, and its high abundance suggests that fish intestines form an important part of its ecological niche. These observations support a hypothesis that bioluminescence plays an ecological role in the marine food web. Despite our improved taxonomical resolution, we identify no geographical differences in bacterial community structure, indicating that the intestinal microbiome of these coastal cod is colonized by a limited number of closely related bacterial species with a broad geographical distribution that are well suited to thrive in this host-associated environment.",

Whenever the protein target of a given disease is not known, it becomes fundamental to have accurate methods for ligand-based Virtual Screening, which compare known active molecules against vast libraries of candidate compounds. Recently, 3D-based similarity methods have been developed that are capable of scaffold-hopping and to superimpose matching molecules. Here, we present InterLig, a new method for the comparison and superposition of small molecules based on 3D, topologically-independent alignments of atoms.

Here, we describe an imaging method for measuring the conformational changes of the voltage sensors of endogenous ion channel proteins within live tissue, without genetic modification. We synthesized GxTX-594, a variant of the peptidyl tarantula toxin guangxitoxin-1E, conjugated to a fluorophore optimal for two-photon excitation imaging through light-scattering tissue. GxTX-594 targets the voltage sensors of Kv2 proteins, which form potassium channels and plasma membrane-endoplasmic reticulum junctions. GxTX-594 dynamically labels Kv2 proteins on cell surfaces in response to voltage stimulation. To interpret dynamic changes in labeling intensity, we developed a statistical thermodynamic model that relates the conformational changes of Kv2 voltage sensors to labeling intensity. We used two-photon excitation imaging of rat brain slices to image Kv2 proteins in neurons. This imaging method enabled identification of conformational changes of endogenous Kv2 voltage sensors in tissue.",

    "abstract": "Larger populations generally adapt faster to their existing environment. However, it is unknown if the population size experienced during evolution influences the ability to face sudden environmental changes. To investigate this issue, we subjected replicate Escherichia coli populations of different sizes to experimental evolution in an environment containing a cocktail of three antibiotics. In this environment, the ability to actively efflux molecules outside the cell is expected to be a major fitness-affecting trait. We found that all the populations eventually reached similar fitness in the antibiotic cocktail despite adapting at different speeds, with the larger populations adapting faster. Surprisingly, whereas efflux activity enhanced in the smaller populations, it decayed in the larger ones. The evolution of efflux activity was largely shaped by pleiotropic responses to selection and not by drift. This demonstrates that quantitative differences in population size can lead to qualitative differences (decay/enhancement) in the fate of a character during adaptation to identical environments. Furthermore, the larger populations showed inferior fitness upon sudden exposure to several alternative stressful environments. These observations provide a novel link between population size and vulnerability to environmental changes. Counter-intuitively, adapting in larger numbers can render bacterial populations more vulnerable to abrupt environmental changes.",

    "abstract": "The availability of completed and draft genome assemblies of tiger, leopard, and other felids provides an opportunity to gain comparative insights on their unique evolutionary adaptations. However, genome-wide comparative analyses are very sensitive to errors in genome sequences and thus require accurate genomic assemblies for reliable evolutionary insights. In this study, while analyzing the tiger genome, we found almost one million erroneous substitutions in the coding and non-coding region of the genome affecting 4,472 genes, hence, biasing the current understanding of tiger evolution. Moreover, these errors produced several misleading observations in previous studies. Thus, to gain insights into the tiger evolution, we corrected the erroneous bases in the genome assembly and gene set of tiger, which was also validated by resequencing of a Bengal tiger genome and transcriptome. A comprehensive evolutionary analysis was performed using 10,920 orthologs from nine mammalian species including the corrected gene sets of tiger and leopard, and using five different methods at three hierarchical levels i.e. felids, Panthera, and tiger. The unique genetic changes in tiger revealed that the genes showing the signatures of adaptation in tiger were enriched in development and neuronal functioning. Specifically, the genes belonging to Notch signalling pathway, which is among the most conserved pathways involved in embryonic and neuronal development, were found to be significantly diverged in tiger in comparison to the other mammals. Our findings suggest the role of adaptive evolution in neuronal functions and development processes, which correlates well with the presence of exceptional traits such as sensory perception, strong neuro-muscular coordination, and hypercarnivorous behavior in tiger.",

However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that control the rate of such clocks. Here, we have examined the human epigenetic clock in patients with a variety of developmental disorders, harbouring mutations in proteins of the epigenetic machinery.\n\nResultsUsing the Horvath epigenetic clock, we performed an unbiased screen for epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) in the blood of these patients. We demonstrate that loss-of-function mutations in the H3K36 histone methyltransferase NSD1, which cause Sotos syndrome, substantially accelerate epigenetic ageing. Furthermore, we show that the normal ageing process and Sotos syndrome share methylation changes and the genomic context in which they occur. Finally, we found that the Horvath clock CpG sites are characterised by a higher Shannon methylation entropy when compared with the rest of the genome, which is dramatically decreased in Sotos syndrome patients.\n\nConclusionsThese results suggest that the H3K36 methylation machinery is a key component of the epigenetic maintenance system in humans, which controls the rate of epigenetic ageing, and this role seems to be conserved in model organisms. Our observations provide novel insights into the mechanisms behind the epigenetic ageing clock and we expect will shed light on the different processes that erode the human epigenetic landscape during ageing.",

    "abstract": "The genetic material of tailed dsDNA bacteriophages, herpesviruses and adenoviruses is packaged into a precursor capsid through a 12-mer ring-shaped protein complex called the portal protein, located at a unique 5-fold vertex. In several phages and viruses, including T4, {Phi}29, and HSV-1, the dodecameric portal protein forms a nucleation complex with scaffolding proteins to initiate procapsid assembly, thereby ensuring incorporation of only one portal complex per capsid. However, for bacteriophage P22, the role of its portal protein in initiation of procapsid assembly is unclear. We recently developed an in vitro P22 assembly assay where portal protein is co-assembled into procapsid-like particles. We also showed that scaffolding protein catalyzes oligomerization of monomeric portal protein into 12-mer rings, and possibly forming a scaffolding-protein nucleation complex that results in one portal complex per P22 procapsid. Here, we present evidence substantiating that P22 portal protein, similar to the other dsDNA viruses, can act as an assembly nucleator. We find that the presence of P22 portal protein is able to increase the rate of particle assembly. Additionally, we show that P22 portal protein proper contributes to proper morphology of the assembled particles. Our results highlight a key function of portal protein as an assembly initiator, a feature likely conserved among these classes of dsDNA viruses.",

The enzymatic erasure of histone modifications is widely assumed to be the primary mechanism that resets epigenetic states during and after DNA replication. Here, we demonstrate that a putative histone-demethylase Epe1 in fission yeast, regulates epigenetic inheritance through a non-enzymatic process. Mutations that map to its putative catalytic domain disrupt its interaction with Swi6HP1 and heterochromatin specific pattern of localization without any requirement for enzymatic activity. Epe1 and Swi6HP1 form an inhibitory complex which displaces histone deacetylases from sites of heterochromatin formation. Sequence-specific recruitment of a histone deacetylase, Clr3 renders heterochromatin refractory to the anti-silencing functions of Epe1 and licenses the inheritance of epigenetic states in cis. Epigenetic inheritance solely depends on the read-write activity of the H3K9 methyltransferase Clr4 which competes with genome-wide nucleosome turnover processes in the absence of enzymatic erasure.",

    "abstract": "Dimensionality reduction is an important task in bioinformatics studies. Common unsupervised methods like principal components analysis (PCA) extract axes of variation that are high-variance but do not necessarily differentiate experimental conditions. Methods of supervised discriminant analysis such as partial least squares (PLS-DA) effectively separate conditions, but are hamstrung by inflexibility and overfit to sample labels. We would like a simple method which repurposes the rich literature of component estimation for supervised dimensionality reduction.\n\nWe propose to address this problem by estimating principal components from a set of difference vectors rather than from the samples. Our method directly utilizes the PCA algorithm as a module, so we can incorporate any PCA variant for improved components estimation. Specifically, Robust PCA, which ameliorates the deleterious effects of noisy samples, improves recovery of components in this framework. We name the resulting method Differential Robust PCA (drPCA). We apply drPCA to several cancer gene expression datasets and find that it more accurately summarizes oncogenic processes than do standard methods such as PCA and PLS-DA.

    "abstract": "Determining where transcription factors (TF) bind in genomes provides insights into which transcriptional programs are active across organs, tissue types, and environmental conditions. Recent advances in high-throughput profiling of regulatory DNA have yielded large amounts of information about chromatin accessibility. Interpreting the functional significance of these datasets requires knowledge of which regulators are likely to bind these regions. This can be achieved by using information about TF binding preferences, or motifs, to identify TF binding events that are likely to be functional. Although different approaches exist to map motifs to DNA sequences, a systematic evaluation of these tools in plants is missing. Here we compare four motif mapping tools widely used in the Arabidopsis research community and evaluate their performance using chromatin immunoprecipitation datasets for 40 TFs. Downstream gene regulatory network (GRN) reconstruction was found to be sensitive to the motif mapper used. We further show that the low recall of FIMO, one of the most frequently used motif mapping tools, can be overcome by using an Ensemble approach, which combines results from different mapping tools. Several examples are provided demonstrating how the Ensemble approach extends our view on transcriptional control for TFs active in different biological processes. Finally, a new protocol is presented to efficiently derive more complete cell type-specific GRNs through the integrative analysis of open chromatin regions, known binding site information, and expression datasets.",

Capturing interindividual variability is essential to increase the statistical power necessary for building more accurate predictive models. However, available approaches have difficulty coping with incomplete datasets which is often the case when combining studies. Additionally, there are hundreds of algorithms available and no simple way to find the optimal one. Here, we developed Sequential Iterative Modelling \"OverNight\" or SIMON, an automated machine learning system that compares results from 128 different algorithms and is particularly suitable for datasets containing many missing values. We applied SIMON to data from five clinical studies of seasonal influenza vaccination. The results reveal previously unrecognized CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets strongly associated with a robust antibody response to influenza antigens. These results demonstrate that SIMON can greatly speed up the choice of analysis modalities. Hence, it is a highly useful approach for data-driven hypothesis generation from disparate clinical datasets.

    "abstract": "Metabolism of energy reserves are essential for bacterial functions such as pathogenicity, metabolic adaptation, and environmental persistence, etc. Previous bioinformatics studies have linked gain or loss of energy reserves such as glycogen and polyphosphate (polyP) with host-pathogen interactions and bacterial virulence based on a comparatively small number of bacterial genomes or proteomes. Thus, understanding the distribution patterns of energy reserves metabolism across bacterial species provides a shortcut route to look into bacterial lifestyle and physiology theoretically. So far, five major energy reserves have been identified in bacteria due to their effective capacity to support bacterial persistence under nutrient deprivation conditions, which include wax ester (WE), triacylglycerol (TAG), polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), polyphosphate, and glycogen. Although unknown pathways directly involved in energy reserves keep being discovered with the continuous endeavour of molecular microbiologists and it is currently rather clear about the enzymes related with the metabolism of energy reserves, there is a lack of systematic study of the pathway or key enzyme distributions of the five energy reserves in bacteria from an evolutionary point of view. With the fast development of sequencing technology, abundant bacterial proteomes are available in public database now. In this study, we sourced 8214 manually reviewed bacterial reference proteomes from UniProt database and used statistical models to search homologous sequences of key enzymes related with energy reserves. The distribution patterns of the pathways for energy reserves metabolism are visualized in taxonomy-based phylogenetic trees. According to the study, it was revealed that specific pathways and enzymes are associated with certain types of bacterial groups, which provides evolutionary insights into the understanding of their origins and functions. In addition, the study also confirmed that loss of energy reserves is correlated with bacterial genome reduction. Through this analysis, a much clearer picture about energy reserves metabolism in bacteria is present, which could serve a guide for further theoretical and experimental analyses of energy reserves metabolism in bacteria.",

Through a combination of molecular, anatomic and functional approaches, we characterized the influence of the microbiota on EAN. We found that intrinsic EAN are functionally adapted to the specific intestinal region they occupy in a microbiota-dependent manner. Furthermore, we observed that gut-extrinsic sympathetic neurons are hyperactivated in the absence of microbes, while the production of butyrate is sufficient to suppress sympathetic activity. Finally, retrograde polysynaptic neuronal tracing from the intestinal wall revealed that brainstem GABAergic neurons are a potential central hub for modulation of gut-specific sympathetic neurons.

    "abstract": "Cancer has been hypothesized to be a caricature of the renewal process of the tissue of origin: arising from (and maintained by) small subpopulations capable of continuous growth1. The strong influence of the tissue structure has been convincingly demonstrated in intestinal cancers where adenomas grow by the fission of stem-cell-maintained glands influenced by early expression of abnormal cell mobility in cancer progenitors2, 3. So-called \"born to be bad\" tumors arise from progenitors which may already possess the necessary driver mutations for malignancy4, 5 and metastasis6. These tumors subsequently evolve neutrally, thereby maximizing intratumoral heterogeneity and increasing the probability of therapeutic resistance. These findings have been nuanced by the advent of multi-region sequencing, which uses spatial and temporal patterns of genetic variation among competing tumor cell populations to shed light on the mode of tumor evolution (neutral or Darwinian) and also the tempo4, 7-11. Using a classic, well-studied model of tumor evolution (a passenger-driver mutation model12-16) we systematically alter spatial constraints and cell mixing rates to show how tissue structure influences functional (driver) mutations and genetic heterogeneity over time. This model approach explores a key mechanism behind both inter-patient and intratumoral tumor heterogeneity: competition for space. Initial spatial constraints determine the emergent mode of evolution (neutral to Darwinian) without a change in cell-specific mutation rate or fitness effects. Transition from early Darwinian to late neutral evolution is accelerated by the combination of two factors: spatial constraints and well-timed dispersal events.",

    "abstract": "In plants, Cryptochromes are photoreceptors that negatively regulate CRL4Cop1(Cul4-RING ubiquitin ligase and its substrate receptor Cop1). In mammals, Cryptochromes are core components of the circadian clock and repressors of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Moreover, mammalian Cryptochromes lost their ability to interact with Cop1, suggesting that they are unable to inhibit CRL4Cop1. Contrary to this assumption, we found that mammalian Cryptochromes are also negative regulators of CRL4Cop1and through this mechanism they repress the GR transcriptional network both in cultured cells and in mouse liver. Mechanistically, Cryptochromes inactivate Cop1 by interacting with Det1, a specific subunit of the mammalian CRL4Cop1complex. Through this interaction, the ability of Cop1 to join the CRL4 complex is inhibited; therefore, its substrates accumulate. Thus, the interaction between Cryptochromes and Det1 in mammals mirrors the interaction between Cryptochromes and Cop1 in planta, pointing to a common ancestor in which the cryptochrome-Cop1 axis originated.",

We probed the behavior of male and female fruit flies in a circular arena as individuals and within all possible pairings. By combining measurements of the animals position in the arena with an unsupervised analysis of their behaviors, we fully define the effects of position in the environment and the presence of a partner on locomotion, grooming, singing, and other behaviors that make up an animals repertoire.

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an increasing threat to public health. Current methods of determining AMR rely on inefficient phenotypic approaches, and there remains incomplete understanding of AMR mechanisms for many pathogen-antimicrobial combinations. Given the rapid, ongoing increase in availability of high density genomic data for a diverse array of bacteria, development of algorithms that could utilize genomic information to predict phenotype could both be useful clinically and assist with discovery of heretofore unrecognized AMR pathways. To facilitate understanding of the connections between DNA variation and phenotypic AMR, we developed a new bioinformatics tool, variant mapping and prediction of antibiotic resistance (VAMPr), to (1) derive gene ortholog-based sequence features for variants; (2) interrogate these explainable gene-level variants for their known or novel associations with AMR; and (3) build accurate models to predict AMR based on whole genome sequencing data. Following the Clinical & Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines, we curated the publicly available sequencing data for 3,393 bacterial isolates from 9 species along with AMR phenotypes for 29 antibiotics. We detected 14,615 variant genotypes and built 93 association and prediction models. The association models confirmed known genetic antibiotic resistance mechanisms, such as blaKPC and carbapenem resistance consistent with the accurate nature of our approach. The prediction models achieved high accuracies (mean accuracy of 91.1% for all antibiotic-pathogen combinations) internally through nested cross validation and were also validated using external clinical datasets. The VAMPr variant detection method, association and prediction models will be valuable tools for AMR research for basic scientists with potential for clinical applicability.",

    "abstract": "The Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia is an autosomal recessive genetic osteochondrodysplasia characterized by dysmorphism, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, nephrotic syndrome and frequently T cell immunodeficiency. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain pathophysiology of the disease, however, the mechanism by which SMARCAL1 mutations cause the syndrome is elusive. Indeed, animal models of the disease are absent or useless to provide insight into the disease mechanism, since they do not recapitulate the phenotype. We generated a conditional knockdown model of SMARCAL1 in iPSCs to mimic conditions of cells with severe form the disease. Here, we characterize this model for the presence of phenotype linked to the replication caretaker role of SMARCAL1 using multiple cellular endpoints. Our data show that conditional knockdown of SMARCAL1 in human iPSCs induces replication-dependent and chronic accumulation of DNA damage triggering the DNA damage response. Furthermore, they indicate that accumulation of DNA damage and activation of the DNA damage response correlates with increased levels of R-loops and replication-transcription interference. Finally, we provide data showing that, in SMARCAL1-deficient iPSCs, DNA damage response can be maintained active also after differentiation, possibly contributing to the observed altered expression of a subset of germ layer-specific master genes. In conclusion, our conditional SMARCAL1 iPSCs may represent a powerful model where studying pathogenetic mechanisms of severe Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia, thus overcoming the reported inability of different model systems to recapitulate the disease.",

The dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) is necessary for multiple types of contextual learning and the place-specific activity of CA1 place cells map out space in a given environment. Here we examined the neuronal representation of context as animals developed morphine-paired environmental associations using a conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm. To investigate changes in the hippocampal encoding before, during, and after drug-pairing, we developed a virtual reality (VR) morphine CPP (Mor-CPP) paradigm and used in vivo two-photon calcium imaging to record the activity of CA1 pyramidal neurons. We found increased activity in rewarded contexts following real-time operant conditioning with water rewards, but not after Mor-CPP training, suggesting different neural encoding mechanisms for natural reinforcers and morphine.",

Here, we elucidate how the translation Initiation Factor 2 (IF2) senses the cellular ppGpp to GTP ratio and regulates the progression towards protein synthesis. Our results show that the affinity of GTP and the inhibitory concentration of ppGpp for 30S-bound IF2 vary depending on the programmed mRNA. Highly translated mRNAs enhanced GTP affinity for 30S complexes, resulting in fast transitions to elongation of protein synthesis. Less demanded mRNAs allowed ppGpp to compete with GTP for IF2, stalling 30S complexes until exchange of the mRNA enhances the affinity for GTP. Altogether, our data unveil a novel regulatory mechanism at the onset of protein synthesis that tolerates physiological concentrations of ppGpp, and that bacteria can exploit to modulate its proteome as a function of the nutritional shift happening during infection.",

    "abstract": "During meiosis, induction of DNA double strand breaks (DSB) leads to recombination between homologous chromosomes, resulting in crossovers (CO) and non-crossovers (NCO). Only 10% DSBs resolve as COs, mostly through a class I pathway dependent on MutS{gamma} (MSH4/ MSH5). Class II CO events represent a minor proportion of the total CO count and also arise from DSBs, but are not thought to involve MutS{gamma}. However, loading of MutS{gamma} occurs very early in prophase I at a frequency that far exceeds the final number of class I COs found in late prophase I. Moreover, loss of MutS{gamma} in mouse results in apoptosis before CO formation, preventing analysis of its CO function. We generated a mutation in the ATP binding domain of Msh5 (Msh5GA). While this mutation was not expected to affect MutS{gamma} complex formation, MutS{gamma} foci do not accumulate during prophase I. Nevertheless, while some spermatocytes from Msh5-/- animals progress into pachynema, most spermatocytes from Msh5GA/GA mice progress to late pachynema and beyond. Some spermatocytes from Msh5GA/GA mice complete prophase I entirely, allowing for the first time an assessment of MSH5 function in CO formation. At pachynema, Msh5GA/GA spermatocytes show persistent DSBs, incomplete homolog pairing, and fail to accumulate MutL{gamma} (MLH1/MLH3). Unexpectedly, Msh5GA/GA diakinesis-staged spermatocytes have no chiasmata at all from any CO pathway, indicating that a functional MutS{gamma} complex in early prophase I is a pre-requisite for all COs.\n\nARTICLE SUMMARYMSH4/MSH5 are critical components of the class I crossover (CO) machinery, which is responsible for >90% of the COs that arise in mammalian meiosis. We generated a point mutation in the ATP binding motif of Msh5, and found that mutant spermatocytes lose all COs, not just those arising from the class I pathway.",

Sex determination evolves fast, often due to changes in the master regulators at the top of the pathway. In addition, some species are polymorphic for multiple different master regulators within natural populations. Understanding the forces that maintain this polygenic sex determination can be informative of the factors that drive the evolution of sex determination. The house fly, Musca domestica, is a well-suited model to those ends because natural populations harbor male-determining loci on each of the six chromosomes and a bi-allelic female-determiner. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that natural selection maintains polygenic sex determination in house fly. However, previous work found that there are very few sequence differences between proto-Y chromosomes and their homologous X chromosomes. This suggests that there is not much genetic variation upon which natural selection could act to maintain polygenic sex determination in house fly. To address this paradox, we performed RNA-seq experiments that examine the effects of the two most common proto-Y chromosomes on gene expression. We find that the proto-Y chromosomes do indeed have a relatively minor effect on gene expression, as expected based on the minimal X-Y sequence differences. Despite these minimal gene expression differences, we identify some patterns that are consistent with sex-specific selection acting on phenotypic effects of proto-Y chromosomes. Our results suggest that, if natural selection maintains polygenic sex determination in house fly, the phenotypic differences under selection are minor and possibly depend on ecological contexts that were not tested in our experimental design.",

We show that the helical centerline pitch and radius of wild-type H. pylori cells dictate surface curvatures of considerably higher positive and negative Gaussian curvatures than those present in straight- or curved-rod bacteria. Quantitative 3D microscopy analysis of short pulses with either N-acetylmuramic acid or D-alanine metabolic probes showed that cell wall growth is enhanced at both sidewall curvature extremes. Immunofluorescence revealed MreB is most abundant at negative Gaussian curvature, while the bactofilin CcmA is most abundant at positive Gaussian curvature. Strains expressing CcmA variants with altered polymerization properties lose helical shape and associated positive Gaussian curvatures. We thus propose a model where CcmA and MreB promote PG synthesis at positive and negative Gaussian curvatures, respectively, and that this patterning is one mechanism necessary for maintaining helical shape.",

    "abstract": "Multiple statistical approaches have been proposed to validate reference genes in qPCR assays. However, conflicting results from these statistical methods pose a major hurdle in the choice of the best reference genes. Indeed, as their respective approaches to calculating reference gene stability is different, their suitability has to be tested for a given experimental setting. In this study, the stability of 10 candidate reference genes (Actb, Gapdh, Tbp, Sdha, Pgk1, Ppia, Rpl13a, Hsp60, Mrpl10, Rps26) was assessed using four common statistical approaches (GeNorm, NormFinder, Coefficient of Variation analysis and Pairwise {Delta}Ct method) in a longitudinal setting. We used the development of the cerebellum and the spinal cord of mice as a model to assess the suitability of these statistical methods for reference gene validation. GeNorm and the Pairwise {Delta}Ct were found to be ill suited due to a fundamental assumption in their stability calculations. Whereas, NormFinder and Coefficient of Variation analysis fare better provided they are used complementarily. We therefore devised a workflow combining these two methods for validating reference genes in developmental studies. This workflow proves to be more robust than any of the methods used individually.",

However, the entry, dispersal, and detection of terrestrial species DNA within waterbodies is understudied.\nC_LIO_LIWe evaluated eDNA metabarcoding of pond water for monitoring semi-aquatic, ground-dwelling, and arboreal mammals, and examined spatiotemporal variation in mammal eDNA signals using experiments in captive and wild conditions.\nC_LIO_LIWe selected nine focal species of conservation and management concern: European water vole, European otter, Eurasian beaver, European hedgehog, European badger, red deer, Eurasian lynx, red squirrel, and European pine marten. We hypothesised that eDNA signals (i.e. proportional read counts) would be stronger for semi-aquatic than terrestrial species, and at sites where mammals exhibited behaviours (e.g. swimming, urination). We tested this by sampling waterbodies in enclosures of captive focal species at specific sites where behaviours had been observed ( directed sampling) and at equidistant intervals along the shoreline ( stratified sampling). We then surveyed natural ponds (N = 6) where focal species were present using stratified water sampling, camera traps, and field signs. eDNA samples were metabarcoded using vertebrate-specific primers.\nC_LIO_LIAll focal species were detected in captivity. eDNA signal strength did not differ between directed and stratified samples across or within species, between species lifestyles (i.e. semi-aquatic, ground-dwelling, arboreal), or according to behaviours. Therefore, eDNA was evenly distributed within artificial waterbodies. Conversely, eDNA was unevenly distributed in natural ponds. eDNA metabarcoding, camera trapping, and field signs detected beaver, red deer, and roe deer. Badger and red fox were recorded with cameras and field signs, but not eDNA metabarcoding. However, eDNA metabarcoding detected small mammals missed by cameras and field signs, e.g. water vole.

Each patient underwent a clinical MRI protocol, which included diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). All DWIs were registered to a template on which rich-club regions have been defined. Using manual outlines of stroke lesions, we automatically counted the number of affected rich-club regions and assessed its effect on the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS; obtained at 90 days post-stroke) scores through ordinal regression.\n\nResultsOf 344 patients (median age 65, inter-quartile range 54-76 years) with a median DWI lesion volume (DWIv) of 3cc, 64% were male. We established that an increase in number of rich-club regions affected by a stroke increases the odds of poor stroke outcome, measured by NIHSS (OR: 1.77, 95%CI 1.41-2.21) and mRS (OR: 1.38, 95%CI 1.11-1.73). Additionally, we demonstrated that the OR exceeds traditional markers, such as DWIv (ORNIHSS 1.08, 95%CI 1.06-1.11; ORmRs 1.05, 95%CI 1.03-1.07) and age (ORNIHSS 1.03, 95%CI 1.01-1.05; ORmRs 1.05, 95%CI 1.03-1.07).\n\nConclusionIn this proof-of-concept study, the number of rich-club nodes affected by a stroke lesion presents a translational biomarker of stroke outcome, which can be readily assessed using standard clinical AIS imaging protocols and considered in functional outcome prediction models beyond traditional factors.",

    "abstract": "Reliable sequential activity of neurons in the entorhinal cortex is necessary to encode spatially guided behavior and memory. In a realistic computational model of a medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) microcircuit, with stellate cells coupled via a network of inhibitory interneurons, we show how intrinsic and network mechanisms interact with theta oscillations to generate reliable outputs. Sensory inputs activate interneurons near their most excitable phase during each theta cycle. As the inputs change, different groups of interneurons are recruited and postsynaptic stellate cells are released from inhibition causing a sequence of rebound spikes. Since the rebound time scale of stellate cells matches theta oscillations, its spikes get relegated to the least excitable phase of theta ensuring that the network encodes only the external drive and ignores recurrent excitation by rebound spikes. In the absence of theta, rebound spikes compete with external inputs and disrupt the sequence that follows. Our simulations concur with experimental data that show, subduing theta oscillations disrupts the spatial periodicity of grid cell receptive fields. Further, the same mechanism where theta modulates the gain of incoming inputs may be used to select between competing sources of input and create transient functionally connected networks.",

These episodes are among other symptoms characterized by altered reward processing and negative symptoms (NS), in particular apathy. However, the neural correlates of these deficits are not well understood.\n\nMethodsWe first assessed the severity of negative symptoms in 25 euthymic BD-I patients compared to 25 healthy controls (HC) and 27 patients with schizophrenia (SZ). Then, we investigated ventral and dorsal striatal activation during reward anticipation in a Monetary Incentive Delayed Task and its association with NS.\n\nResultsIn BD-I patients NS were clearly present and the severity of apathy was comparable to SZ patients. Apathy scores in the BD-I group but not in the SZ group correlated with sub-syndromal depression scores. At the neural level, we found significant ventral and dorsal striatal activation in BD-I patients and no group differences with HC or SZ patients. In contrast to patients with SZ, apathy did not correlate with striatal activation during reward anticipation. Explorative whole brain analyses revealed reduced extra-striatal activation in BD-I patients compared to HC and an association between reduced activation of the inferior frontal gyrus and apathy.\n\nConclusionThis study found that in BD-I patients apathy is present to an extent comparable to schizophrenia, but is more strongly related to sub-syndromal depressive symptoms. The findings support the view of different pathophysiological mechanisms underlying apathy in the two disorders and suggest that extra-striatal dysfunction may contribute to impaired reward processing and apathy in BD-I.",

Yet, all of the discussion on heredity has been based on non-DNA evidence. It is largely neglected that DNA and environmental data at individual level are indispensable for understanding the development of cognitive ability. In this article, we report findings from a study that uses both ability-related polygenic scores (PGSs) and a rich set of socioeconomic measures from Add Health. In an all-ethnicity sample excluding blacks, a social-science model predicts verbal ability well yielding an R2 of 17.5%. Adding two ability-related PGSs increases this R2 by 1.7%. Such models yield more accurate estimates of the effects of the PGSs and those of SES context, and provide an estimated degree to which SES context is influenced by parental genomes. Schooling and neighborhood remain important to verbal ability even after an early measure of verbal ability is adjusted in the model. Although the influence from the genome is evident, the influences of SES context are critical and cannot be dismissed.",

    "abstract": "Trauma exposure is an important risk factor for several psychiatric disorders; however, the mechanisms that underlie emotional and behavioral responses to traumatic stress are unclear. To understand these mechanisms, this study investigated the genetic overlap and causal relationship between blood metabolites and traits related to trauma response using genome-wide data. Five traits related to trauma response \"in the past month\" ascertained in the UK Biobank (52 816<N<117 900 individuals) were considered: i) \"Avoided activities or situations because of previous stressful experience\" (Avoidance); ii) \"Felt distant from other people\" (Distant); iii) \"Felt irritable or had angry outbursts\" (Irritable); iv) \"Felt very upset when reminded of stressful experience\" (Upset); v) \"Repeated disturbing thoughts of stressful experience\" (Repeated Thoughts). These were investigated with respect to 52 metabolites assessed using nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics in a previous genome-wide association study (up to 24,925 individuals of European descent). Applying linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC), polygenic risk scoring (PRS), and Mendelian randomization (MR), we observed that 14 metabolites were significantly correlated with trauma response traits (p<0.05); PRS of 4 metabolites (citrate (CIT); glycoprotein acetyls (GP); concentration of large very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) particles (LVLDLP); total cholesterol in medium particles of VLDL (MVLDLC)) were associated with traits related to trauma response (false discovery rate Q<10%). These associations were partially due to causal relationships (CIT[-&gt;]Upset {beta}=-0.058, p=9.1x10-4; GP[-&gt;]Avoidance {beta}=0.008, p=0.003; LVLDLP[-&gt;]Distant {beta}=0.008, p=0.022; MVLDLC[-&gt;]Avoidance {beta}=0.019, p=3x10-4).

The molecular mass of the plant proteins ranged from 0.54 to 2236.8 kDa. A putative Type-I polyketide synthase (22244 amino acids) in Volvox carteri was found to be the largest protein in the plant kingdom and was not found in higher plant species. Titin (806.46 kDa) and misin/midasin (730.02 kDa) were the largest proteins identified in higher plant species. The pI and molecular weight of the plant proteome exhibited a trimodal distribution. An acidic pI (56.44% of proteins) was found to be predominant over a basic pI (43.34% of proteins) and the abundance of acidic pI proteins was higher in unicellular algae species relative to multicellular higher plants. In contrast, the seaweed, Porphyra umbilicalis, possesses a higher proportion of basic pI proteins (70.09%). Plant proteomes were also found to contain the amino acid, selenocysteine (Sec), which is the first report of the presence of this amino acid in plants. Additionally, plant proteomes also possess ambiguous amino acids Xaa (unknown), Asx (asparagine or aspartic acid), Glx (glutamine or glutamic acid), and Xle (leucine or isoleucine) as well.",

    "abstract": "Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Brazil is a neglected vector-borne tropical parasitic disease that is responsible for several thousand human deaths every year. The numbers of cases more than doubled between 1990 and 2016. Transmission occurs when sand flies become infected after feeding on infected dogs (the reservoir host) and then subsequently on humans. A major component of the VL control effort is the identification and euthanasia of infected dogs to remove them as a source of infection. Rapid, accurate identification of infected dogs would be key to this strategy.\n\nHere we demonstrate the potential of a volatile organic chemical analyser (eNose) to rapidly and accurately identify dogs infected with Leishmania infantum parasites. The eNose could discriminate between the odours present in the hair of infected and uninfected dogs with greater than 95% sensitivity and 95% specificity. The device was sufficiently sensitive to be able to identify infected dogs even when parasite loads in the circulating blood were very low.\n\nFuture improvements to VOC analyser technology, portability and ease of use suggest that this methodology could significantly improve the diagnosis of VL infected dogs in Brazil and elsewhere and with other parasitic diseases such as Malaria, Chagas Disease and Leishmania in humans.",

    "abstract": "Superresolution Optical Fluctuation Imaging (SOFI) offers a simple and affordable alternative to the more sophisticated (and expensive) super-resolution imaging techniques such as STED, PALM, STORM, structured illumination, and other derivative methods. In SOFI, the calculation of high order cumulants provides higher resolution but drastically expands the dynamic range of the resulting image. In this study, we have identified another type of artifact for high order SOFI cumulants, dubbed as  cusp artifacts. A series of realistic simulations are performed to study the cusp artifacts under the influences of various factors, including the blinking statistics, the spatial distribution of photophysical properties of the sample, the total number of frames processed per dataset, photobleaching, and noise. Experiments, simulations, and theory all show that high order cumulants and odd-order moments could suffer from cusp artifacts. These cusp artifacts also degrade the fidelity of bSOFI that has been proposed to solve the dynamic range expansion of image pixel intensities. Alternatively, cusp-artifacts could be altogether eliminated by utilizing even-order moments constructed directly or from cumulants for image reconstruction. Together with dynamic range compression, these approaches yield improved SOFI images. Our study provides new insight into the nature of high order SOFI images, outlines guidelines for developing and screening SOFI-optimized fluorescence probes, and suggests improved strategies for SOFI data acquisition.",

    "abstract": "The role of infectious disease in regulating host populations is increasingly recognized, but how environmental conditions affect pathogen communities and infection levels remains poorly understood. Over three years, we compared foliar disease burden, fungal pathogen community composition, and foliar chemistry in the perennial bunchgrass Stipa pulchra occurring in adjacent serpentine and nonserpentine grassland habitats with distinct soil types and plant communities. We found that serpentine and nonserpentine S. pulchra experienced consistent, low disease pressure associated with distinct fungal pathogen communities with high interannual species turnover. Additionally, plant chemistry differed with habitat type. The results indicate that this species experiences minimal foliar disease associated with diverse fungal communities that are structured across landscapes by spatially and temporally variable conditions. Distinct fungal communities associated with different growing conditions may shield S. pulchra from large disease outbreaks, contributing to the low disease burden observed on this and other Mediterranean grassland species.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

Using the Ion Torrent platform, we developed a low-cost next generation sequencing (NGS) gene panel that has been transferred into clinical practice, replacing single disease gene analyses for the early diagnosis of individuals with ID/ASD. The gene panel was designed using an innovative in silico approach based on disease networks and mining data from public resources to score disease-gene associations. We analyzed 150 unrelated individuals with ID and/or ASD and a confident diagnosis has been reached in 26 cases (17%). Likely pathogenic mutations have been identified in another 15 patients, reaching a total diagnostic yield of 27%. Our data also support the pathogenic role of genes recently proposed to be involved in ASD. Although many of the identified variants need further investigation to be considered disease-causing, our results indicate the efficiency of the targeted gene panel on the identification of novel and rare variants in patients with ID and ASD.",

Compared to multi-class logistic regression, a representative multi-class classifier, our kernelized WSR improves the performance for the ENIGMA Challenge set from 0.72 to 0.97 in binary AUC (Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve) and from 0.64 to 0.80 in ordinal multi-class AUC. WSR model interpretation and protein structural interpretation reach consensus in corroborating the most probable molecular mechanisms by which some pathogenic BRCA1 variants confer clinical significance, namely metal-binding disruption for C44F and C47Y, protein-binding disruption for M18T, and structure destabilization for S1715N.",

    "abstract": "Abstract.An undesirable side effect of drugs are cardiac arrhythmias, in particular a condition called torsades de pointes. Current paradigms for drug safety evaluation are costly, lengthy, and conservative, and impede efficient drug development. Here we combine multiscale experiment and simulation, high-performance computing, and machine learning to create an easy-to-use risk assessment diagram to quickly and reliable stratify the pro-arrhythmic potential of new and existing drugs. We capitalize on recent developments in machine learning and integrate information across ten orders of magnitude in space and time to provide a holistic picture of the effects of drugs, either individually or in combination with other drugs. We show, both experimentally and computationally, that drug-induced arrhythmias are dominated by the interplay of two currents with opposing effects: the rapid delayed rectifier potassium current and the L-type calcium current. Using Gaussian process classification, we create a classifier that stratifies safe and arrhythmic domains for any combinations of these two currents. We demonstrate that our classifier correctly identifies the risk categories of 23 common drugs, exclusively on the basis of their concentrations at 50% current block. Our new risk assessment diagram explains under which conditions blocking the L-type calcium current can delay or even entirely suppress arrhythmogenic events. Using machine learning in drug safety evaluation can provide a more accurate and comprehensive mechanistic assessment of the pro-arrhythmic potential of new drugs. Our study shapes the way towards establishing science-based criteria to accelerate drug development, design safer drugs, and reduce heart rhythm disorders.",

    "abstract": "The first molecular model of modern human origins published in 1983 had the mtDNA phylogenetic tree rooted in Asia. This model was subsequently overlooked and superseded by the African Eve model in 1987 that was premised on the unrealistic infinite site assumption and the now failed molecular clock hypothesis. We have recently developed a new framework of molecular evolution, the maximum genetic diversity (MGD) hypothesis, which has in turn led us to discover a new model of modern human origins with the roots of uniparental DNAs placed in East Asia. While the African mtDNA Eve model has haplotype N as ancestral to R, our Asia model places R as the ancestor of all. We here examined ancient mtDNAs from the literature focusing on the relationship between N and R. The data showed that all three oldest mtDNAs were R with the 45000 year old Ust-Ishim a basal type and the two ~40000 year old samples sub-branch of R. Among the numerous mtDNAs of 39500-30000 year old, most were R subtype U and only two were N samples, the 39500 year old Oase1 and the 34425 year old Salkhit. These N types are basal and hence likely close to the root of N. These ancient DNA findings suggest that basal R is ~5000 years older than basal N, thereby confirming the East Asia model and invalidating the African Eve model.",

While the mechanisms behind the sequential nature of the underlying brain activity are likely multifarious and multi-scale, in this work we attempt to characterize to what degree some of this properties can be explained as a consequence of simple associative learning. To this end, we employ a parsimonious firing-rate attractor network equipped with the Hebbian-like Bayesian Confidence Propagating Neural Network (BCPNN) learning rule relying on synaptic traces with asymmetric temporal characteristics. The proposed network model is able to encode and reproduce temporal aspects of the input, and offers internal control of the recall dynamics by gain modulation. We provide an analytical characterisation of the relationship between the structure of the weight matrix, the dynamical network parameters and the temporal aspects of sequence recall. We also present a computational study of the performance of the system under the effects of noise for an extensive region of the parameter space. Finally, we show how the inclusion of modularity in our network structure facilitates the learning and recall of multiple overlapping sequences even in a noisy regime.",

Here we argue against this assumption by showing that an extremely open-ended, high level cognitive task-loosely defined as \"abstract thinking\" leads to a precise, and highly consistent activation maps. Thus we show that activation maps generated during such cognitive process were precisely located relative to borders of well-known networks such as internal speech, visual and motor imagery. The activation patterns allowed decoding the thought condition at >95%. Surprisingly, the activated networks remained the same regardless of changes in thought content. Finally, we found a remarkably consistent activation map across individuals engaged in abstract thinking. The activation to abstract thinking bordered, but strictly avoided visual and motor networks. On the other hand, it partly overlapped with left lateralized language networks. These observations were supported by a quantitative neuronal distance metric analysis. Our results reveal that despite its high level, and varied content nature-abstract thinking activates surprisingly precise and consistent networks in the participants brains.\n\nThinker refers to: The agent of thought; Intellectual, one who tries to use his or her intellect to work, study, reflect, speculate on, or ask and answer questions with regard to a variety of different ideas\" (Wikipedia).",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the use of a large number of object concepts and naturalistic object images has been growing enormously in cognitive neuroscience research. Classical databases of object concepts are based mostly on a manually-curated set of concepts. Further, databases of naturalistic object images typically consist of single images of objects cropped from their background, or a large number of uncontrolled naturalistic images of varying quality, requiring elaborate manual image curation. Here we provide a set of 1,854 diverse object concepts sampled systematically from concrete picturable and nameable nouns in the American English language. Using these object concepts, we conducted a large-scale web image search to compile a database of 26,107 high-quality naturalistic images of those objects, with 12 or more object images per concept and all images cropped to square size. Using crowdsourcing, we provide higher-level category membership for the 27 most common categories and validate them by relating them to representations in a semantic embedding derived from large text corpora. Finally, by feeding images through a deep convolutional neural network, we demonstrate that they exhibit high selectivity for different object concepts, while at the same time preserving variability of different object images within each concept. Together, the THINGS database provides a rich resource of object concepts and object images and offers a tool for both systematic and large-scale naturalistic research in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and computer science.",

    "abstract": "Cell-type-specific chromosome conformation is correlated with differential gene regulation. Broad compartmentalization into two compartments (A & B) is proposed to be the main driver of cell-specific chromosome organization. However it is unclear what fraction of chromosome conformation changes between cell types and conditions is independent of changes in compartmentalization and whether any such compartment-independent reorganization is functionally important. We developed MultiMDS to jointly infer and align 3D chromosomal structures, thereby enabling a quantitative comparison of locus-specific changes across Hi-C datasets. We compared Hi-C datasets from yeast, which lack compartmentalization, grown with and without galactose. These comparisons confirmed known relocalizations as well as identifying additional examples. We also compared mammalian datasets across a variety of cell lines. We found a consistent enrichment for changes along the A/B compartment (nuclear interior/nuclear periphery) axis, even when comparing the same cell type from different individuals. Despite the prevalence of compartment changes, we consistently find compartment-independent relocalizations of loci that are within the A compartment in both compared cell types. Some such intra-compartment relocalizations involve loci that display enhancer-associated histone marks in one cell type and polycomb-associated histone marks in the other. MultiMDS thus enables a new way to compare chromosome conformations across two Hi-C datasets.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/seqcode/multimds",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance is rapidly expanding, in a large part due to mobile genetic elements. We screened 94 fecal fluoroquinolone-resistant Escherichia coli isolates from Nigeria for six plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes. Sixteen isolates harbored at least one of the PMQR genes and four were positive for aac-6-Ib-cr. In one strain, aac-6-Ib-cr was mapped to a 125 Kb self-transmissible IncFII plasmid, pMB2, which also bears blaCTX-M-15, seven other functional resistance genes and multiple resistance pseudogenes. We hypothesized that pMB2 had been selected by antimicrobials and that its large size would confer a growth disadvantage. However, laboratory strains carrying pMB2 grew at least as fast as isogenic strains lacking the plasmid in both rich and minimal media. We excised a 32 Kb fragment containing the sitABCD and another putative transporter, pefB, a papB homolog, and several open-reading frames of unknown function. The resulting 93 Kb mini-plasmid conferred slower growth rates and lower fitness than wildtype pMB2. Trans-complementing the deletion with the cloned sitABCD genes confirmed that they accounted for the growth advantage conferred by pMB2 in iron-depleted media. The mini-plasmid additionally conferred autoaggregation and was less transmissible and both phenotypes could be complemented with a pefB clone. pMB2 is a large plasmid with a flexible resistance region that contains multiple loci that can account for evolutionary success in the absence of antimicrobials. Ancillary functions conferred by resistance plasmids can mediate their retention and transmissibility, worsening the trajectory for antimicrobial resistance and potentially circumventing efforts to contain resistance through restricted use.",

Nonetheless, acutely recording electrical activity from these structures in head-fixed awake rodents has been very challenging due to the fact that head-fixed preparations are not designed for stereotactic accuracy. We overcome this issue by designing the DeepTarget, a system for stereotactic head-fixation and recording, which allows for accurately directing recording electrodes or other probes into any desired location in the brain. We then validated it by performing intracellular recordings from optogenetically-tagged amygdalar neurons followed by histological reconstruction, which revealed that it is accurate and precise to within [~]100 m. Moreover, in another group of mice we were able to target both the mammillothalamic tract and subthalamic nucleus.

    "abstract": "Touch is a fundamental aspect of mammalian social, parental and sexual behavior. Human affective touch is critical for healthy child development and shows great promise as a novel therapeutic strategy for mental disorders characterized by social dysfunction, such as anxiety, depression and autism spectrum disorder. However, despite our detailed knowledge about cortical processing of non-social touch, we still know very little about how social touch modulates cortical circuits. We investigated the activity patterns of single neurons (N = 1156) across five sensory and frontal cortical areas in both male and female rats (N = 28) engaging in naturalistic social facial touch with male and female conspecifics. We found that information about social touch is widely available across cortex. Besides touch, the sex of the interaction partner (a biologically significant feature) is a major determinant of single neuron activity, and across cortex we observed 25.7%  touch and 11.9%  sex-touch responses. Although all areas investigated had access to social touch and partner sex information, social touch modulated different cortical areas in different ways. Finally, we found that network activity patterns during social touch depend on both subject sex and partner sex. Interestingly, these sex-differences in network activity patterns were differences in response magnitude and would not be evident without single cell resolution. Our observations suggest that socio-sexual characteristics of touch (subject and partner sex) widely modulate cortical activity and need to be investigated with cellular resolution.",

    "abstract": "Expectations and prior knowledge strongly affect and even shape our visual perception. Specifically, valid expectations speed up perceptual decisions, and determine what we see in a noisy stimulus. Bayesian models have been remarkably successful to capture the behavioral effects of expectation. On the other hand several more mechanistic neural models have also been put forward, which will be referred as \"predictive computation models\" here. Both Bayesian and predictive computation models treat perception as a probabilistic inference process, and combine prior information and sensory input. Despite the well-established effects of expectation on recognition or decision-making, its effects on low-level visual processing, and the computational mechanisms underlying those effects remain elusive. Here we investigate how expectations affect early visual processing at the threshold level. Specifically, we measured temporal thresholds (shortest duration of presentation to achieve a certain success level) for detecting the spatial location of an intact image, which could be either a house or a face image. Task-irrelevant cues provided prior information, thus forming an expectation, about the category of the upcoming intact image. The validity of the cue was set to 100, 75 and 50% in different experimental sessions. In a separate session the cue was neutral and provided no information about the category of the upcoming intact image. Our behavioral results showed that valid expectations do not reduce temporal thresholds, rather violation of expectation increases the thresholds specifically when the expectation validity is high. Next, we implemented a recursive Bayesian model, in which the prior is first set using the validity of the specific experimental condition, but in subsequent iterations it is updated using the posterior of the previous iteration. Simulations using the model showed that the observed increase of the temporal thresholds in the unexpected trials is not due to a change in the internal parameters of the system (e.g. decision threshold or internal uncertainty). Rather, further processing is required for a successful detection when the expectation and actual input disagree. These results reveal some surprising behavioral effects of expectation at the threshold level, and show that a simple parsimonious computational model can successfully predict those effects.",
