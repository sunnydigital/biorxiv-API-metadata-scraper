    "abstract": "ObjectivesTo investigate the relationship between visual acuity (VA), total area of geographic atrophy (GA) and percentage of foveal GA.\n\nMethodsMulticenter, retrospective cross-sectional study of patients with GA due to age-related macular degeneration. Demographics, VA, fundus autofluorescence (FAF) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images were collected. Using FAF images aided by OCT, foveal sparing status, GA pattern, total GA size, and percentage of GA covering the foveal area - area within a 1.5 mm diameter circle centered on the fovea centralis - were assessed. Univariable and multiple linear regression analyses were performed.\n\nResults54 eyes (mean age 78.7 {+/-}7.7 (SD), 60.0% female) were studied. Mean VA was 0.8 {+/-} 0.6 logMAR, mean total GA 8.8 {+/-} 6.7 mm2 and mean percentage of foveal GA was 71.5 {+/-} 30.9%. Of all assessed eyes, 48.2% (n = 26) presented with multifocal GA, and 18.5% (n = 10) had foveal sparing. Multiple regression analysis revealed that, controlling for age and GA pattern, the percentage of foveal GA presented a statistically significant association with VA ({beta} = 0.41, P = 0.004). No significant associations were observed with mean total GA size, while controlling for the same variables ({beta} = 0.010, P = 0.440).\n\nConclusionPercentage of foveal GA was significantly associated with VA impairment, while the same was not verified for total GA area. These findings suggest that percentage of foveal GA may represent a more useful tool for assessing the impact of GA on VA. Further validation is needed in larger cohorts.",

Here, we establish an approach for selectively targeting fan cells in layer 2 (L2) of LEC. Whereas complete lesions of the LEC were previously found to abolish associative recognition memory, we find that after selective suppression of synaptic output from fan cells mice still recognise novel object-context configurations, but are impaired in recognition of novel object-place-context associations. Our experiments suggest a segregation of memory functions within LEC networks and indicate that specific inactivation of fan cells leads to behavioural deficits reminiscent of early stages of Alzheimers disease.",

    "abstract": "Isolated growth hormone deficiency type II (IGHD2) is mainly caused by heterozygous splice-site mutations in intron 3 of the GH1 gene. A dominant negative effect of the mutant growth hormone (GH) lacking exon 3 on wild-type GH secretion has been proposed; however, the molecular mechanisms involved are elusive. To uncover the molecular systems underlying GH deficiency in IGHD2, we established IGHD2 model mice, which carry both wild-type and mutant copies of the human GH1 gene, replacing each of the endogenous mouse Gh loci. Our IGHD2 model mice exhibited growth retardation associated with intact cellular architecture and mildly activated ER stress in the pituitary gland, caused by decreases in the growth hormone releasing hormone receptor (Ghrhr) and Gh gene promoter activities. Decreases in Ghrhr and Gh promoter activities were likely caused by reduced levels of nuclear CREB3L2, which was demonstrated to stimulate the activity of the Ghrhr and Gh promoters. This is the first in vivo study revealing a novel molecular mechanism of GH deficiency in IGHD2, representing a new paradigm, differing from widely accepted models.",

    "abstract": "Ciguatera fish poisoning is an illness contracted through the ingestion of seafood containing ciguatoxins. It is prevalent in tropical regions worldwide, including in Australia. Ciguatoxins are produced by some species of Gambierdiscus. Therefore, screening of Gambierdiscus species identification through quantitative PCR (qPCR), along with the determination of species toxicity, can be useful in monitoring potential ciguatera risk in these regions. In Australia, the identity, distribution and abundance of ciguatoxin producing Gambierdiscus spp. is largely unknown. In this study we developed a rapid qPCR assay to quantify the presence and abundance of Gambierdiscus lapillus, a likely ciguatoxic species. We assessed the specificity and efficiency of the qPCR assay. The assay was tested on 25 environmental samples from the Heron Island reef in the southern Great Barrier Reef, a ciguatera endemic region, in triplicate to determine the presence and patchiness of these species across samples from Chnoospora sp., Padina sp. and Sargassum macroalgal hosts.\n\nAuthors summaryCiguatera fish poisoning is a human disease contracted by ingesting seafood contaminated with a group of neurotoxins. The group of neurotoxins, named ciguatoxins, are synthesised by species of single celled marine algae from the genus Gambierdiscus.\n\nCiguatera fish poisoning occurs worldwide, particularly in tropical nations. Pacific Island nations are disproportionately impacted, and this impact is predicted to increase as the effects of climate change unfold. Few effective monitoring and mitigation strategies exist for ciguatera fish poisoning, and reporting rates of the disease are estimated to be approximately 20% at best. A global ciguatera strategy was developed by a group of researchers coordinated by UNESCOs Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission to characterise the cause and mode of action of ciguatera fish poisoning, as a matter of urgency.\n\nIn this study, we designed a qPCR assay to detect a species of microalgae, Gambierdiscus lapillus. Gambierdiscus lapillus produces compounds with ciguatoxin-like properties, which may lead to ciguatoxin uptake in fish in the Australian region. This assay was sensitive and able to detect the presence of Gambierdiscus lapillus in a range of environmental samples from the Great Barrier Reef region, Australia.",

    "abstract": "Recent self-report and behavioral studies have demonstrated that pubertal testosterone is related to an increase in risky and impulsive behavior. Yet, the mechanisms underlying such a relationship are poorly understood. Findings from both human and rodent studies point towards distinct striatal pathways including the ventral and dorsal striatum as key target regions for pubertal hormones. In this study we investigated task-related impatience of boys between 10 and 15 years of age (N = 75), using an intertemporal choice task combined with measures of functional magnetic resonance imaging and hormonal assessment. Increased levels of testosterone were associated with a greater response bias towards choosing the smaller sooner option. Furthermore, our results show that testosterone specifically modulates the dorsal, not ventral, striatal pathway. These results provide novel insights into our understanding of adolescent impulsive and risky behaviors and how pubertal hormones are related to neural processes.",

Recent reports on tetrameric PSI raised questions regarding its structural basis, physiological role, phylogenetic distribution and evolutionary significance. In this study, by examining PSI in 61 cyanobacteria, we show that tetrameric PSI, correlating with a unique psaL gene and genomic structure, is widespread in the heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria and their close relatives. Physiological studies on these cyanobacteria revealed that tetrameric PSI is favored under high light, with an increased content of novel PSI-bound carotenoids (myxoxanthophyll, canthaxanthan and echinenone). Together this work suggests that tetrameric PSI is an adaptation to high light, along with results showing that change in PsaL leads to trimeric PSI monomerization, supporting the hypothesis of tetrameric PSI being the evolutionary intermediate in the transition from cyanobacterial trimeric PSI to monomeric PSI in plants and algae.",

    "abstract": "Tracer-based metabolism is becoming increasingly important to study metabolic mechanisms in cells. NMR offers several approaches to measure label incorporation in metabolites, including 13C and 1H-detected spectra. The latter are generally more sensitive but quantification depends on the proton carbon 1JCH coupling constant which varies significantly between different metabolites. It is therefore not possible to have one experiment optimised for all metabolites and quantification of 1H-edited spectra such as HSQCs requires precise knowledge of coupling constants. Increasing interest in tracer-based and metabolic flux analysis requires robust analyses with reasonably small acquisition times. Here we compare 13C-filtered and 13C-edited methods for quantification with a special focus towards application in real-time NMR of cancer cells under near-physiological conditions. We find an approach using a double-filter most suitable and sufficiently robust to reliably obtain 13C-incorporations from difference spectra. This is demonstrated for JJN3 multiple myeloma cells processing glucose over 24h.",

    "abstract": "The transient build-up of DNA supercoiling during the translocation of replication forks threatens genome stability and is controlled by DNA topoisomerases (TOPs). This crucial process has been exploited with TOP poisons for cancer chemotherapy. However, pinpointing cellular determinants of the best clinical response to TOP poisons still remains enigmatic. Here, we present an integrated approach and demonstrate that endogenous and exogenous expression of the oncofetal high-mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) protein exhibited broad protection against the formation of hydroxyurea-induced DNA breaks in various cancer cells, thus corroborating our previously proposed model in which HMGA2 functions as a replication fork chaperone that forms a protective DNA scaffold at or close to stalled replication forks. We now further demonstrate that high levels of HMGA2 also protected cancer cells against DNA breaks triggered by the clinically important TOP1 poison irinotecan. This protection is most likely due to the recently identified DNA supercoil constraining function of HMGA2 in combination with exclusion of TOP1 from binding to supercoiled substrate DNA. In contrast, low to moderate HMGA2 protein levels surprisingly potentiated the formation of irinotecan-induced genotoxic covalent TOP1-DNA cleavage complexes. Our data from cell-based and several in vitro assays indicate that, mechanistically, this potentiating role involves enhanced drug-target interactions mediated by HMGA2 in ternary complexes with supercoiled DNA. Subtelomeric regions were found to be extraordinarily vulnerable to these genotoxic challenges induced by TOP1 poisoning, pointing at strong DNA topological barriers located at human telomeres. These findings were corroborated by an increased irinotecan sensitivity of patient-derived xenografts of colorectal cancers exhibiting low to moderate HMGA2 levels. Collectively, we uncovered a therapeutically important control mechanism of transient changes in chromosomal DNA topology that ultimately leads to enhanced human subtelomere stability.\n\nAuthor SummaryDNA replication fork stability in rapidly dividing cancer cells is of utmost importance for the maintenance of genome stability and cancer cell viability. Cancer cells efficiently prevent fork collapse into lethal double strand breaks as a first line of defense during replication stress, but the corresponding protective mechanisms often remain elusive.\n\nUncontrolled high levels of DNA supercoiling that are generally regulated by topoisomerases can cause replication stress and are major threats to fork stability. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we identified a possible regulatory mechanism of replication stress, which appears to involve mitigating the consequences of DNA topological changes by the oncofetal replication fork chaperone HMGA2.\n\nOur work provides mechanistic insights into the control of DNA damage triggered by clinically important anti-cancer drugs, which is mediated by the replication fork chaperone HMGA2. We thereby also identify HMGA2 expression as a predictive therapeutic marker, which could allow clinicians to take informed decisions to prevent tumor recurrence and improve survival.",

Here we set up the targeted deletion of cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) controlling the transcription of Drosophila muscle identity transcription factors (iTF) to generate larval muscle identity mutants. By focusing on one muscle transcription and morphology, we show that selection of muscle attachment sites and the precision of muscle/muscle matching is intrinsic to muscle identity. It involves propagation of the iTF expression code from a founder myoblast to the other syncytial nuclei after fusion. Live imaging indicates that the precise staggered muscle attachment pattern involves attraction to tendon cells and homotypic repulsion.

We found no difference in responses between carriers and non-carriers when PBMCs were stimulated with a panel of TLR ligands. However, PBMCs stimulated with live S. aureus elicited a significantly different response that also differed from the response elicited following stimulation with dead S. aureus. Furthermore, we observed a distinct stimulation profile for PBMCs isolated from persistent carriers stimulated with their respective live or dead carriage strains compared to responses observed for PBMCs isolated from non-carriers that were similar regardless of whether or not the bacteria were alive or not.

    "abstract": "During infection, pathogens secrete effectors, key elements of pathogenesis. In several phytopathogenic fungi, synchronous waves of effector genes are expressed during plant infection to manipulate and silence plant defenses. In Zymoseptoria tritici, causing septoria leaf blotch of wheat, at least two waves of effector genes are expressed, during the asymptomatic phase and at the switch to necrotrophy. The underlying factors responsible for the fine-tuned regulation of effector gene expression in this pathogen are unknown. Previously, a detailed map of the chromatin structure in vitro of Z. tritici was generated by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) targeting histone modifications typical for euchromatin (di-methylation of the lysine 4 of the histone H3, H3K4me2) or heterochromatin (tri-methylation of the lysine 9 and 27 of the histone H3, H3K9me3 and H3K27me3). Based on the hypothesis that changes in the histone modifications contribute to the transcriptional control of pathogenicity-related genes, we tested whether different sets of genes are associated with different histone modifications in vitro. We correlated the in vitro histone maps with in planta transcriptome data and show that genes located in heterochromatic domains in vitro are highly up-regulated at the switch toward necrotrophy. We combined our integrated analyses of genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic data with ChIP-qPCR in planta and thereby provide further evidence for the involvement of histone modifications in the transcriptional dynamic of putative pathogenicity-related genes of Z. tritici.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus, GBS) normally colonizes healthy adults but can cause invasive disease, such as meningitis, in the newborn. To gain access to the central nervous system, GBS must interact with and penetrate brain or meningeal blood vessels; however, the exact mechanisms are still being elucidated. Here, we investigate the contribution of BspC, an antigen I/II family adhesin, to the pathogenesis of GBS meningitis. Disruption of the bspC gene reduced GBS adherence to human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC), while heterologous expression of BspC in non-adherent Lactococcus lactis conferred bacterial attachment. In a murine model of hematogenous meningitis, mice infected with {Delta}bspC mutants exhibited lower mortality as well as decreased brain bacterial counts and inflammatory infiltrate compared with mice infected with WT GBS strains. Further, BspC was both necessary and sufficient to induce neutrophil chemokine expression. We determined that BspC interacts with the host cytoskeleton component vimentin, and confirmed this interaction using a bacterial two-hybrid assay, immunofluorescent staining, and imaging flow cytometry. Vimentin null mice were protected from WT GBS infection and also exhibited less inflammatory cytokine production in brain tissue. These results suggest that BspC and the vimentin interaction is critical for the pathogenesis of GBS meningitis.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYGroup B Streptococcus (GBS) typically colonizes healthy adults but can cause severe disease in immune compromised individuals, including newborns. Despite wide-spread intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis given to pregnant women, GBS remains a leading cause of neonatal meningitis. To cause meningitis, GBS must interact with and penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which separates bacteria and immune cells in the blood from the brain. In order to develop targeted therapies to treat GBS meningitis, it is important to understand the mechanisms of BBB crossing. Here, we describe the role of the GBS surface factor, BspC, in promoting meningitis and discover the host ligand for BspC, vimentin, which is an intermediate filament protein that is constitutively expressed by endothelial cells. We determined that BspC interacts with the C-terminal domain of cell-surface vimentin to promote bacterial attachment to brain endothelial cells and that purified BspC protein can induce immune signaling pathways. In a mouse model of hematogenous meningitis, we observed that a GBS mutant lacking BspC was less virulent compared to WT GBS and resulted in less inflammatory disease. We also observed that mice lacking vimentin were protected from GBS infection. These results reveal the importance of the BspC-vimentin interaction in the progression of GBS meningitis disease.",

While mutation bias partially explains this variation, prokaryotes near-universally have a higher GC content than predicted solely by this bias. Debate surrounds the relative importance of the remaining explanations of selection versus biased gene conversion favoring GC alleles. Some environments (e.g. soils) are associated with a high genomic GC content of their inhabitants, which implies that this content may be a selective adaptation to particular habitats. Here, we report a novel association between the presence of the non-homologous end joining DNA doublestrand break repair pathway and GC content; this observation suggests that high GC content may be an adaptation to facilitate repair of double strand breaks when homologous recombination is not possible. We discuss potential mechanisms accounting for the observed association, and provide preliminary evidence that sites experiencing higher rates of doublestrand breaks are under selection for increased GC content relative to the genomic background.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDFrequent de-novo somatic mutations in major components (PI3KCA, AKT3, TSC1, TSC2, mTOR, BRAF) of molecular pathways crucial for cell differentiation, proliferation, growth and migration (mTOR, MAPK) has been previously implicated in malformations of cortical development (MCDs) and low-grade neuroepithelial tumors (LNETs) 1-7. LNETs are the most frequent tumors found in patients undergoing resective surgery for refractory epilepsy treatment. BRAFV600E is found in up to 70% of LNETs. Previous studies suggest a causal relationship between those de-novo somatic mutations in mTOR, MAPK pathways and seizures occurrence, even without presence of malformation or a tumor 2, 3, 8-13. Recently Koh and colleagues 14 showed that BRAFV600E mutation may cause seizures through activation of RE1-silecing transcription factor (REST). Additionally, they showed a significant downregulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity pathways and decreased expression of multiple ion channels subunits including HCN1, KCNQ3, SCN2A and SCN3B. The downregulation of those genes including GABA receptors subunits and protein expression specific to interneurons subpopulations (SST, VIP) suggests that a dysregulated inhibitory circuits are responsible for seizures in GGs. The experimental manipulation - In-Utero electroporation of episomal activating Cre plasmids that they used to test their hypothesis in mice however activated mutant BRAFV637 only in excitatory neurons. And the downregulated genes in mice were confirmed by qRT-PCR in the whole tissue samples. The question of how electrophysiological properties of the affected and surrounding neurons are changed were not addressed. The changes in ion conductances and neuronal circuits responsible for seizures could be only inferred from gene expression profiles. Purpose of the current work was to investigate how overactive human BRAFV600E mutated protein incorporated into the mouse genome through piggyBase transposition increase neuronal excitability in ex-vivo mouse cortical slices and whether it induces histopathological features and gene expression profile alteration observed in low-grade neuroepithelial tumors (LNETs).\n\nMETHODSUsing In-Utero Electroporation we have introduced human BRAFV600E protein into radial glia progenitors in mouse embryonic cortex on the background of piggyBac transposon system that allows incorporation of the DNA sequence of interest into the genome. Immunohistochemistry was used for examination of known markers in LNETs. RNA sequencing on Illumina NextSeq 500 was used to examine alterations in gene expression profiles. Whole-cell current- and voltage-clamp was used to examine changes in electrophysiological properties. Unsupervised Hierarchical Clustering Analysis was used to examine grouping of different conditions based on their gene expression profile and electrophysiological properties. Video electrocorticographic recordings were used to test whether BRAFV600E transgenic mice have spontaneous seizures.\n\nRESULTSUnder GLAST driving promoter BRAFV600E induced astrogenesis, caused morphological alterations in transgenic cells akin to balloon-like cells, and delayed neuronal migration. Under NESTIN driver promoter BRAFV600E increased neurogenesis, induced balloon-like cells and caused some cells to remain close to the lateral ventricle displaying large soma size compared to neurons in the upper cortical layers. Some of the balloon-like cells were immunopositive for astroglial marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and for both upper and lower cortical layers markers (Cux1 and Ctip2). Gene ontology analysis for BRAFV600E gene expression profile showed that there is a tissue-wide increased inflammatory immune response, complement pathway activation, microglia recruitment and astrocytes activation, which supported increased immunoreactivity to microglial marker iba1, and to GFAP respectively. In current clamp BRAFV600E neurons have increased excitability properties including more depolarized resting membrane potential, increased input resistance, low capacitance, low rheobase, low action potential (AP) voltage threshold, and increased AP firing frequency. Additionally, BRAFV600E neurons have increased SAG and rebound excitation, indicative of increased hyperpolarization activated depolarizing conductance (IH), which is confirmed in voltage-clamp. The sustained potassium current sensitive to tetraethylammonium was decreased in BRAFV600E neurons.. In 4 out of 59 cells, we have also observed a post-action potential depolarizing waves, frequencies of which increased in potassium current recording when Ca2+ was substituted to Co2+ in the extracellular solution (5/24). We show that using 20 electrophysiological properties BRAFV600E neurons segregate separately from other conditions. Comparison of electrophysiological properties of those neurons with neurons bearing somatic mutations in mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) pathway regulatory components, overactivation of which is been shown in malformations of cortical development (MCDs), showed that expression of PIK3CAE545K under GLAST+ promoter and TSC1 knockdown (KD) with CRISPR-Cas9 have different effects on neuronal excitability.",

    "abstract": "Gastropods are known to secrete mucus for a variety of purposes, including locomotion, reproduction, adhesion to surfaces, and lubrication. A less commonly known function of mucus secretion in this group involves its use as a defence against predation. Among the terrestrial slugs, mucus that serves this particular purpose has been studied for only a handful of species under laboratory conditions, where it is thought to be produced for self-fouling or to make individuals difficult to consume. However, the mechanisms of how these defensive secretions operate and their effectiveness in deterring predation in the natural world have not be described in much detail. In this study, we provide evidence of adhesive mucus secretions in the red triangle slug (Triboniophorus graeffei) as an adaptation against predation. Field observations of a large red-eyed green tree frog (Litoria chloris) trapped in the mucus secretions of a nearby T. graeffei revealed that this mucus serves to incapacitate predators rather than just simply as an overall deterrence. Mechanical stimulation of T. graeffei under laboratory conditions revealed that adhesive secretions were produced from discrete sections of the dorsal surface when disturbed, leading to the production of a highly sticky and elastic mucus that was unlike the thin and slippery mucus used during locomotion. The adhesiveness of the defensive secretions was strengthened and reactivated when in contact with water. This appears to not only be the first description of defensive mucus production in this slug species but one of the first natural observations of the use of adhesive defence secretions to incapacitate a predator. The biomechanical properties of this mucus and its ability to maintain and strengthen its hold under wet conditions make it potentially useful in the development of new adhesive materials.",

We explored the regulation of the vesicular transporters ClC-3, ClC-4, and ClC-5 by the adenylic system components ATP, ADP, and AMP. Using heterologous expression and whole-cell electrophysiology, we demonstrated that cytosolic ATP and ADP but not AMP and Mg2+-free ADP enhance CLC ion transport via binding to the protein C-terminal CBS domains. Biophysical investigations revealed that the effects depend on the delivery of intracellular protons into the CLC transport machinery and result from modified voltage-dependence and altered probability that CLC proteins undergo silent non-transporting cycles. Our findings demonstrate that the CLC CBS domains are able to serve as energy sensors by detecting changes in the cytosolic ATP/ADP/AMP equilibrium. The adenine nucleotide regulation of vesicular Cl-/H+ exchange creates a link between the activity of the endolysosomal system and the cellular metabolic state.",

    "abstract": "MotivationSingle-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables high throughput measurement of RNA expression in individual cells. Due to technical limitations, scRNA-seq data often contain zero counts for many transcripts in individual cells. These zero counts, or dropout events, complicate the analysis of scRNA-seq data using standard analysis methods developed for bulk RNA-seq data. Current scRNA-seq analysis methods typically overcome dropout by combining information across cells, leveraging the observation that cells generally occupy a small number of RNA expression states.\n\nResultsWe introduce netNMF-sc, an algorithm for scRNA-seq analysis that leverages information across both cells and genes. netNMF-sc combines network-regularized non-negative matrix factorization with a procedure for handling zero inflation in transcript count matrices. The matrix factorization results in a low-dimensional representation of the transcript count matrix, which imputes gene abundance for both zero and non-zero entries and can be used to cluster cells. The network regularization leverages prior knowledge of gene-gene interactions, encouraging pairs of genes with known interactions to be close in the low-dimensional representation. We show that netNMF-sc outperforms existing methods on simulated and real scRNA-seq data, with increasing advantage at higher dropout rates (e.g. above 60%). Furthermore, we show that the results from netNMF-sc - including estimation of gene-gene covariance - are robust to choice of network, with more representative networks leading to greater performance gains.\n\nAvailabilitynetNMF-sc is available at github.com/raphael-group/netNMF-sc.\n\nContactbraphael@princeton.edu",

    "abstract": "Many antibiotics target the assembly of cell wall peptidoglycan, an essential, heteropolymeric mesh that encases most bacteria. Different species have characteristic subcellular sites of peptidoglycan synthesis that they must carefully maintain for surface integrity and, ultimately, viability. In rod-shaped bacteria, cell wall elongation is spatially precise yet relies on a limited pool of lipid-linked precursors that generate and are attracted to membrane disorder. By tracking enzymes, substrates and products of peptidoglycan biosynthesis in Mycobacterium smegmatis, we show that precursors are made in plasma membrane domains that are laterally and biochemically distinct from sites of cell wall assembly. Membrane partitioning is required for robust, orderly peptidoglycan synthesis, indicating that these domains help template peptidoglycan synthesis. The cell wall-organizing protein DivIVA and the cell wall itself are essential for domain homeostasis. Thus, the peptidoglycan polymer feeds back on its membrane template to maintain an environment conducive to directional synthesis. We further show that our findings are applicable to rod-shaped bacteria that are phylogenetically distant from M. smegmatis, demonstrating that horizontal compartmentalization of precursors is a general feature of bacillary cell wall biogenesis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

Pelagibacter) there were notable differences in the global isoelectric point (pI) of proteins. We have analysed global metagenomic proteomes and have added more prokaryotes to extend the pI comparison. Without exception, in a set that included archaea and multiple bacterial phyla, the proteome pI distribution varied, with more acidic values in marine and neutral/basic in freshwater microbes. Four pairs of highly related prokaryotes of marine and freshwater origin revealed marked differences manifested mostly in the residues located at the protein surface. This study has also shown that the magnitude of the change depended on protein location (secreted > cytoplasmic > transmembrane) and affected proteins encoded at both core and flexible genome. Our results point to a very extensive variation taking place in microbes when they move from marine (salt-rich) to freshwater habitats. These adaptations would require long evolutionary times to produce changes involving many genes in the core genome.

Here, we show that AMG modulates primary fibroblast migration and accelerates skin re-epithelialization without affecting cell proliferation. We demonstrate that AMG is enriched in a pool of WH-associated growth factors that may provide the initiation signal for a faster endogenous wound healing response. This, in turn leads to increased cell migration rate by elevating activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway and subsequent activation of matrix metalloproteinase expression and their extracellular enzymatic activity. Moreover, AMG-treated wounds showed increased granulation tissue formation and organized collagen content.

    "abstract": "BackgroundLongitudinal studies of cortical morphology are best facilitated by parcellation schemes that are compatible across all life stages. Until recently, neonatal atlases derived strictly from neonatal data, rather than warping brain labels from an adult atlas, did not exist. The Melbourne Childrens Regional Infant Brain (M-CRIB) and M-CRIB 2.0 atlases now provide voxel-based parcellations of the cerebral cortex within T2-weighted neonatal images. These atlases are compatible with the Desikan-Killiany (DK) and the Desikan-Killiany-Tourville (DKT) cortical labelling schemes commonly used for older children and adults. However, there is still a need for a surface-based approach for parcellating neonatal images using these atlases.\n\nAimsWe aimed to introduce surface-based versions of the M-CRIB and M-CRIB 2.0 atlases, termed M-CRIB-S(DK) and M-CRIB-S(DKT), along with a pipeline for automated parcellation with FreeSurfer tools. We also aimed to evaluate the automated parcellation accuracy of our M-CRIB-S atlases using cross-validation with manually labelled data; and to evaluate accuracy of the proposed automated parcellation pipeline for the M-CRIB-S labels against the publicly available surface-based University of North Carolina (UNC) 4D neonatal atlas, which has labels derived from the DK adult atlas.\n\nMethodsUsing datasets of 10 M-CRIB or M-CRIB 2.0 manually labelled ground truth images and 48 unlabelled T2-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI) of healthy neonates, cortical surfaces were extracted using the Deformable module within MIRTK. Cortical regions from the labelled images were encoded into a spherical template space using FreeSurfer tools wherein M-CRIB-S(DK) and M-CRIB-S(DKT) atlases were constructed. Automatic parcellation of the labelled and unlabelled (L+U) images (n=58) using the M-CRIB-S(DK) and M-CRIB-S(DKT) atlases were computed with Bayesian labelling using FreeSurfer tools. Accuracy was assessed by comparison with manually labelled ground truth data (n=10) using Dice coefficients and within a Leave-One-Out (LOO) cross-validation framework. Agreement of the UNC atlas parcellations with manual M-CRIB labelling was also evaluated using Dice coefficients.\n\nResultsWhen comparing automated parcellations from the M-CRIB-S atlases to manual labels, disagreements were mostly closely confined to region boundaries, suggesting high overlap overall. Quantitatively, average regional Dice coefficients were 0.88 (L+U) and 0.83 (LOO) for the M-CRIB 2.0 labels and 0.87 (L+U), 0.80 (LOO) for the M-CRIB labels, and 0.67 for the UNC atlas.\n\nConclusionsThe M-CRIB-S atlases and automatic pipeline described in this paper allow infant cortical surfaces to be accurately parcellated according to the DK or DKT parcellation schemes. This will help facilitate surface-based investigations of brain function at the neonatal time point, and potentially longitudinally across the lifespan. The use of M-CRIB-S outperformed a technique that relies on an adult-derived atlas. The atlases, averaged white, inflated, pial and spherical surfaces, along with customised scripts for segmentation, cortical surface extraction and parcellation, are available for public download.",

    "abstract": "While numerous studies have explored single-word naming, few have evaluated the behavioral and neural correlates of more naturalistic language, like connected speech, which we produce every day. Here, in a retrospective analysis of 120 participants at least six months following left hemisphere stroke, we evaluated the distribution of word errors (paraphasias) and associated brain damage during connected speech (picture description) and object naming. While paraphasias in connected speech and naming shared underlying neural substrates, analysis of the distribution of paraphasias suggested that lexical-semantic load is likely reduced during connected speech. Using voxelwise lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM), we demonstrated that verbal (real word: semantically related and unrelated) and sound (phonemic and neologistic) paraphasias during both connected speech and naming loaded onto the left hemisphere ventral and dorsal streams of language, respectively. Furthermore, for the first time using both connected speech and naming data, we localized semantically related paraphasias to more anterior left hemisphere temporal cortex and unrelated paraphasias to more posterior left temporal and temporoparietal cortex. The connected speech results, in particular, highlight a gradient of specificity as one translates visual recognition from left temporo-occipital cortex to posterior and subsequently anterior temporal cortex. The robustness of VLSM results for sound paraphasias derived during connected speech was notable, in that analyses performed on sound paraphasias from the connected speech task, and not the naming task, demonstrated significant results following removal of lesion volume variance and related apraxia of speech variance. Therefore, connected speech may be a particularly sensitive task on which to evaluate further lexical-phonological processing in the brain. The results presented here demonstrate the related, though different, distribution of paraphasias during connected speech, confirm that paraphasias arising in connected speech and single-word naming likely share neural origins, and endorse the need for continued evaluation of the neural substrates of connected speech processes.",

    "abstract": "Beta-lactam antibiotics comprise one of the earliest known classes of antibiotic therapies. These molsecules covalently inhibit enzymes from the family of penicillin-binding proteins, which are essential to the construction of the bacterial cell wall. As a result, beta-lactams have long been known to cause striking changes to cellular morphology. The exact nature of the changes tend to vary by the precise PBPs engaged in the cell since beta-lactams exhibit a range of PBP enzyme specificity. The traditional method for exploring beta-lactam polyspecificity is a gel-based binding assay which is low-throughput and typically run ex situ in cell extracts. Here, we describe a medium-throughput, image-based assay combined with machine learning methods to automatically profile the activity of beta-lactams in E. coli cells. By testing for morphological change across a panel of strains with perturbations to individual PBP enzymes, our approach automatically and quantifiably relates different beta-lactam antibiotics according to their preferences for individual PBPs in cells. We show the potential of our approach for guiding the design of novel inhibitors towards different PBP-binding profiles by recapitulating the activity of two recently-reported PBP inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile is a ubiquitous, diarrheagenic pathogen often associated with healthcare-acquired infections that can cause a range of symptoms from mild, self-limiting disease to toxic megacolon and death. Since the early 2000s, a large proportion of C. difficile cases have been attributed to the ribotype 027 (RT027) lineage, which is associated with sequence type 1 (ST1) in the C. difficile multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme. The spread of ST1 has been attributed, in part, to resistance to fluoroquinolones used to treat un-related infections, which creates conditions ideal for C. difficile colonization and proliferation. In this study, we analyzed 27 isolates from a healthcare network in northern Arizona, USA, and 1,352 public ST1 genomes to place locally-sampled isolates into a global context. Core genome, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis demonstrated that at least 6 separate introductions of ST1 were observed in healthcare facilities in northern Arizona over an 18-month sampling period. A reconstruction of transmission networks identified potential nosocomial transmission of isolates following two of these introductions, which were only identified via whole genome sequence analysis. Antibiotic resistance heterogeneity was observed among ST1 genomes, including variability in resistance profiles among locally sampled ST1 isolates. To investigate why ST1 genomes are so common globally, we compared all high-quality C. difficile genomes and identified that ST1 genomes have gained and lost a number of genomic regions compared to all other C. difficile genomes; analyses of other toxigenic C. difficile sequence types demonstrates that this loss may be anomalous and could be related to niche specialization. These results suggest that a combination of antimicrobial resistance and gain and loss of specific genes may explain the prominent association of this sequence type with C. difficile infection cases worldwide. The degree of genetic variability in ST1 suggests that classifying all ST1 genomes into a quinolone-resistant hypervirulent clone category may not be appropriate. Whole genome sequencing of clinical C. difficile isolates provides a high-resolution surveillance strategy for monitoring persistence and transmission of C. difficile and for assessing the performance of infection prevention and control strategies.",

Usually, multiple timeconsuming assessments are required to define a holistic sensorimotor profile of proximal (shoulder-elbow) and distal (wrist-hand) impairments and their impact on the capacity to perform activities. We propose and evaluate a novel physiologically-motivated computational framework for objectively assessing sensorimotor profiles in neurological patients using a single, rapid technology-based assessment involving goal-directed arm and hand movements.\n\nMethodsThe Virtual Peg Insertion Test (VPIT) was administered to 121 healthy and 80 neurological subjects. The framework provides 25 kinematic and kinetic metrics expected to describe 12 sensorimotor components representative of ataxia and paresis and their influence on task performance, as well as one overall disability measure. The feasibility (protocol duration), structural validity (factor analysis and correlations{rho} between sensorimotor components), concurrent validity (correlation with Action Research Arm Test; ARAT), and discriminant validity (comparing healthy controls and patients, and patients with different disability levels) were evaluated.\n\nResultsThe median VPIT protocol duration was 16.5min in neurological patients. The sensor-based metrics could unambiguously be grouped into 12 mostly independent (median |{rho}|=0.14) components. Ten components showed significant differences between healthy and impaired subjects and nine components indicated clear trends across disability levels, without any ceiling effects. The VPIT overall disability measure and ARAT were moderately correlated ({rho}=-0.53, p<0.001).\n\nConclusionsThis work demonstrates the possibility to rapidly, holistically, and objectively assess proximal and distal sensorimotor impairments and their influence on the capacity to perform activities with a single assessment.",

    "abstract": "Quantification of the effect of spatial tumour sampling on the patterns of mutations detected in next-generation sequencing data is largely lacking. Here we use a spatial stochastic cellular automaton model of tumour growth that accounts for somatic mutations, selection, drift and spatial constrains, to simulate multi-region sequencing data derived from spatial sampling of a neoplasm. We show that the spatial structure of a solid cancer has a major impact on the detection of clonal selection and genetic drift from bulk sequencing data and single-cell sequencing data. Our results indicate that spatial constrains can introduce significant sampling biases when performing multi-region bulk sampling and that such bias becomes a major confounding factor for the measurement of the evolutionary dynamics of human tumours. We present a statistical inference framework that takes into account the spatial effects of a growing tumour and allows inferring the evolutionary dynamics from patient genomic data. Our analysis shows that measuring cancer evolution using next-generation sequencing while accounting for the numerous confounding factors requires a mechanistic model-based approach that captures the sources of noise in the data.\n\nSummarySequencing the DNA of cancer cells from human tumours has become one of the main tools to study cancer biology. However, sequencing data are complex and often difficult to interpret. In particular, the way in which the tissue is sampled and the data are collected, impact the interpretation of the results significantly. We argue that understanding cancer genomic data requires mathematical models and computer simulations that tell us what we expect the data to look like, with the aim of understanding the impact of confounding factors and biases in the data generation step. In this study, we develop a spatial simulation of tumour growth that also simulates the data generation process, and demonstrate that biases in the sampling step and current technological limitations severely impact the interpretation of the results. We then provide a statistical framework that can be used to overcome these biases and more robustly measure aspects of the biology of tumours from the data.",

We benchmark two leading object detection algorithms across multiple challenging 2-D microscopy datasets as well as develop and demonstrate an algorithm which can localize and image cells in 3-D, in real-time. Furthermore, we exploit the fast processing of these algorithms and develop a simple and effective Augmented Reality (AR) system for fluorescence microscopy systems. Object detection networks are well-known high performance networks famously applied to the task of identifying and localizing objects in photography images. Here we show their application and efficiency for localizing cells in fluorescence microscopy images. Object detection algorithms are typically trained on many thousands of images, which can be prohibitive within the biological sciences due to the cost of imaging and annotating large amounts of data. Through taking different cell types and assays as an example, we show that with some careful considerations it is possible to achieve very high performance with datasets with as few as 26 images present. Using our approach, it is possible for relatively non-skilled users to automate detection of cell classes with a variety of appearances and enable new avenues for automation of conventionally manual fluorescence microscopy acquisition pipelines.",

We have developed such a method. We vary the elastic moduli of millimeter-sized abiotic gels that contain fluorescent beads to act as tracers for phagocytosis. We isolate human neutrophils, expose them to gels for one hour, and then measure what percentage of neutrophils contain beads - this is our metric for successful phagocytosis. Both increased polymer concentration in agarose gels and increased crosslinking density in alginate gels are associated with decreased success of phagocytosis. When we plot the percentage of neutrophils containing beads as a function of the gel elastic modulus, we find that data from both alginate and agarose gels collapse onto the same curve. This demonstrates the utility of our method as a way of measuring how the viscoelastic mechanics of a large target impact the success of phagocytosis.",

In doing so, we quantified among-individual variation in vulnerability to cause-specific mortality resulting from differences in body size and spawning location relative to a hydropower dam.\nC_LIO_LIWe constructed a multistate mark-recapture model to estimate harvest and background mortality hazard rates as functions of a discrete state (spawning location) and an individual time-varying covariate (body size). We further accounted for among-year variation in mortality and migratory behavior and fit the model to a unique 50-year time-series of mark-recapture-recovery data on brown trout (Salmo trutta) in Norway.\nC_LIO_LIHarvest mortality was highest for intermediate-sized trout, and outweighed background mortality for most of the observed size range. Background mortality decreased with body size for trout spawning below the dam and increased for those spawning above.

    "abstract": "Cannabinoid receptor-1 (CB1) represents a potential drug target against conditions that include obesity and substance abuse. However, drug trials targeting CB1 (encoded by the CNR1 gene) have been compromised by differences in patient response. Towards addressing the hypothesis that genetic and epigenetic changes within the regulatory regions controlling CNR1 expression contribute to these differences, we isolated the human CNR1 promotor (CNR1prom) and demonstrate its activity in primary cells and transgenic mice. We also provide evidence of CNR1prom in CB1 autoregulation and its repression by DNA-methylation. We further characterised a conserved regulatory sequence (ECR1) in CNR1 intron 2 that contained a polymorphism in linkage disequilibrium with disease associated SNPs. Deletion of ECR1 from mice using CRISPR genome editing significantly reduced CNR1 expression in the hippocampus. These mice also displayed reduced ethanol intake and hypothermia response to CB1 agonism. Moreover, human specific C-allele variants of ECR1 (ECR1(C)) drove higher levels of CNR1prom activity in hippocampal cells than did the ancestral T-allele. We further demonstrate a role for the AP-1 transcription factor in driving higher ECR1(C) activity. In the context of the known roles of CB1 the current study suggests a mechanism through which ECR1(C) may be neuroprotective in the hippocampus against stress. The cell-specific approaches used in our study to determine the functional effects of genetic and epigenetic changes on the activity of tissue-specific regulatory elements at the CNR1 locus represent an important step in gaining a mechanistic understanding of cannabinoid pharmacogenetics.",

    "abstract": "Colonic spirochaetosis, diagnosed based on the striking appearance in histological sections, still has an obscure clinical relevance and only few bacterial isolates from this condition have been characterized to date. In a randomized, population-based study in Stockholm, Sweden, 745 healthy individuals underwent colonoscopy with biopsy sampling. In these individuals, 17 (2.3 %) had colonic spirochaetosis, which was associated with eosinophilic infiltration and a three-fold increased risk for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We aimed to culture the bacteria and perform whole genome sequencing of the isolates from this unique representative population sample. From 14 out of 17 individuals with spirochaetosis we successfully isolated, cultured and performed whole genome sequencing of in total 17 isolates including the Brachyspira aalborgi type strain 513AT. Also, 16S analysis of the mucosa-associated microbiota was performed in the cases and non-spirochaetosis controls.\n\nThis is the first report of whole genome analysis of clinical isolates from individuals with colonic spirochaetosis. We found one isolate to be of the species Brachyspira pilosicoli and all remaining isolates were of the species Brachyspira aalborgi. Besides displaying extensive genetic heterogeneity, the isolates harboured several mucin-degrading enzymes and other virulence-associated genes that could confer a pathogenic potential in the human colon. We also showed that 16S amplicon sequencing using standard primers for human microbiota studies fail to detect Brachyspira due to primer incompatibility. This failure to detect colonic spirochaetosis should be taken into consideration in project design and interpretation of gastrointestinal tract microbiota in population-based and clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Shigellosis is a highly infectious disease that are mainly transmitted via faecal-oral contact of the bacteria Shigella. Four species have been identified in Shigella genus, among which S. flexneri is used to be the most prevalent species globally and commonly isolated from developing countries. However, it is being replaced by S. sonnei that is currently the main causative agent for dysentery pandemic in many emerging industrialized countries such as Asia and the Middle East with unclear reasons. For a better understanding of S. sonnei virulence and antibiotic resistance, we sequenced 12 clinical S. sonnei strains with varied antibiotic-resistance profiles collected from four cities in Jiangsu Province, China. Phylogenomic analysis clustered antibiotic sensitive and resistant S. sonnei into two distinct groups while pangenome analysis reveals the presence and absence of featured genes in each group. Screening of 31 classes of virulence factors found out that type 2 secretion system is doubled in resistant strains. Further principle component analysis based on the interactions between virulence and resistance indicated that abundant virulence factors are associated with higher resistant phenotypes. The result present here is based on statistical analysis of a small sample size and serves basically as a guidance for further experimental and theoretical studies.",

    "abstract": "Our sensory systems actively predict sensory information based on previously learnt patterns. An inability to accurately predict forthcoming information results in prediction errors. Individuals with schizophrenia consistently show reduced auditory prediction errors as well as reduced microstructure in auditory white matter pathways. However, it is not clear if also healthy individuals with psychotic experiences demonstrate such deficits. Participants underwent electroencephalography (EEG) recordings while listening to a simple two-tone duration deviant oddball paradigm (N=103) and a stochastic oddball paradigm (N=89). A subset of participants (N=89) also underwent diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), from which fractional anisotropy (FA), a measure of overall white matter microstructure, was obtained for auditory pathways namely the auditory interhemispheric pathway, as well as the left and right arcuate fasciculi. We investigated both structural and functional predictors of positive psychotic experiences in healthy participants as measured by the Community Assessment for Psychic Experiences positive dimension (CAPE+) scores. Prediction errors evoked by the classical oddball paradigm failed to reveal significant effects, whereas the stochastic oddball paradigm revealed significant clusters at typical mismatch negativity periods predictive of CAPE+ scores. Furthermore, we show that white matter microstructure from auditory pathways in addition to mismatches significantly predict CAPE+ scores. We suggest that structural and functional prediction error measures together may have potential in predicting psychotic experiences in the healthy population.",

    "abstract": "When exposed to fluctuating light intensity, chloroplasts move towards weak light (accumulation response), and away from strong light (avoidance response). In addition, cold treatment (5{degrees}C) induces the avoidance response even under weak light conditions (cold-avoidance response). These three responses are mediated by the phototropin (phot), which is a blue-light photoreceptor and has also been found to act as a thermosensory protein that perceives temperature variation. Our previous report indicated that cold-induced changes in phot biochemical activity initiate the cold-avoidance response. In this study, we further explored the induction mechanism of the cold-avoidance response in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha and examined the relationship between changes in the amount of phot and the induction of the cold-avoidance response. The switch between the accumulation and avoidance responses occurs at a so-called  transitional light intensity. Our physiological experiments revealed that a cold-mediated decrease in the transitional light intensity leads to the induction of the cold-avoidance response. While artificial overexpression of phot decreased the transitional light intensity as much as cold treatment did, the amount of endogenous phot remained unchanged by cold treatment in wild-type M. polymorpha. Taken together, these findings show that the cold-avoidance response is initiated by a cold-mediated reduction of the transitional light intensity, independent of the amount of endogenous phot. This study provides a clue to understand the mechanism underlying the switch in direction of chloroplast relocation in response to light and temperature.",

Here we investigate the unbinding of the iperoxo agonist to its target human neuroreceptor M2, embedded in a neuronal membrane. By feeding out-of-equilibrium molecular simulations data in a classification analysis, we identify the few essential reaction coordinates of the process. The full landscape is then reconstructed using an exact enhanced sampling method, well-tempered metadynamics in its funnel variant. The calculations reproduce well the measured affinity, provide a rationale for mutagenesis data and show that the ligand can escape via two different routes. The allosteric modulator LY2119620 turns out to hamper both escapes routes, thus slowing down the unbinding process, as experimentally observed. This computationally affordable protocol is totally general and it can be easily applied to determine the full free energy landscape of membrane receptors/drug interactions.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=81 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/544577v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cfc6b2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fde50corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c8a893org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b36a12_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical TOC Entry\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Membrane tethering is a highly regulated event that occurs during the initial physical contact between membrane-bounded transport carriers and their target subcellular membrane compartments, thereby ensuring the spatiotemporal specificity of intracellular membrane trafficking. Although Rab-family small GTPases and specific Rab-interacting effectors, such as coiled-coil tethering proteins and multisubunit tethering complexes, are known to be involved in membrane tethering, how these protein components directly act upon the tethering event remains enigmatic. Here, we investigated the molecular basis of membrane tethering by comprehensively and quantitatively evaluating the intrinsic capacities of 10 representative human Rab-family proteins (Rab1a, 3a, 4a, 5a, 6a, 7a, 9a, 11a, 27a, and 33b) to physically tether two distinct membranes via homotypic and heterotypic Rab-Rab assembly in a chemically defined reconstitution system. All of the Rabs tested, except Rab27a, specifically caused homotypic membrane tethering at physiologically relevant Rab densities on membrane surfaces (e.g., Rab-to-lipid molar ratios of 1:100-1:3,000). Notably, endosomal Rab5a retained its intrinsic potency to drive efficient homotypic tethering even at concentrations below the Rab-to-lipid ratio of 1:3,000. Comprehensive reconstitution studies further uncovered that heterotypic combinations of human Rab-family isoforms, including Rab1a/6a, Rab1a/9a, and Rab1a/33b, can directly and selectively mediate membrane tethering. Rab1a and Rab9a, in particular, synergistically triggered very rapid and efficient membrane tethering reactions through their heterotypic trans-assembly on two opposing membranes. Thus, our findings establish that, in the physiological context, homotypic and heterotypic trans-assembly of Rab-family small GTPases can provide the essential molecular machinery necessary to drive membrane tethering in eukaryotic endomembrane systems.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLong-term data from marked animals provide a wealth of opportunities for studies with high relevance to both basic ecological understanding and successful management in a changing world. The key strength of such data is that they allow to quantify individual variation in vital rates (e.g. survival, growth, reproduction) and then link it mechanistically to dynamics at the population level. However, maintaining the collection of individual-based data over long time periods comes with large logistic efforts and costs, and studies spanning over decades are therefore rare. This is the case particularly for migratory aquatic species, many of which are in decline despite their high ecological, cultural, and economical value.\n\nNew informationThis paper describes two unique publicly available time series of individual-based data originating from a 51-year mark-recapture study of a land-locked population of large-sized migratory brown trout (Salmo trutta) in Norway: the Hunder trout. In the period 1966-2015, nearly 14,000 adult Hunder trout have been captured and individually marked during their spawning migration from Lake Mjosa to the river Gubrandsdalsl[a]gen. Almost a third of those individuals were later recaptured alive during a later spawning run and/or captured by fishermen and reported dead or alive. This has resulted in the first data series: a mark-recapture-recovery dataset spanning half a century and more than 18,000 capture records. The second data series consists of additional data on juvenile and adult growth and life-history schedules from half of the marked individuals, obtained by means of scale sample analysis. The two datasets offer a rare long-term perspective on individuals and population dynamics and provide unique opportunities to gain insights into questions surrounding management, conservation, and restoration of migratory salmonid populations and freshwater ecosystems.",

Meta-analysis identified a total of 8 loci significantly associated with the cytokine network, of which two (PDGFRB and ABO) had not been detected previously. Bayesian colocalisation analysis revealed shared causal variants between the eight cytokine loci and other traits; in particular, cytokine network variants at the ABO, SERPINE2, and ZFPM2 loci showed pleiotropic effects on the production of immune-related proteins; on metabolic traits such as lipoprotein and lipid levels; on blood-cell related traits such as platelet count; and on disease traits such as coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes.",

We investigated the association of age, sex and gut bacterial alpha diversity in three large cohorts of adults from four geographical regions: US and UK cohorts in the American Gut Project, and two independent cohorts of Colombians and Chinese. In three of the four cohorts, we observed a strong positive association between age and alpha diversity in young adults that plateaued after age 40. We also found pronounced sex-dependent differences in younger but not middle-aged adults, and women had higher alpha diversity than men. In contrast, no association of alpha diversity with age or sex was observed in the Chinese cohort. These associations were maintained after adjusting for cardiometabolic parameters in the Colombian cohort and antibiotic usage in the AGP cohort, suggesting that these factors do not affect the association of alpha diversity with age and sex. We also used a machine learning approach to predict individual age based on the gut microbiome. Consistent with our alpha diversity-based findings, women had significantly higher predicted age than men in the US and UK cohort, with a reduced difference above age 40. This was not observed in the Colombian cohort and only in the group of middle-age adults in the Chinese cohort. Together, our results provide new insights into the influence of age and sex on biodiversity of the human gut microbiota during adulthood while highlighting similarities and differences across diverse cohorts.",

Under-standing and quantifying how uncertainties in the fiducial locations affect the locations of cortical sources is important for interpreting EEG analyses. We systematically shifted fiducial locations to investigate the relationship between variations of fiducial locations and the corresponding estimations of the source locations. We quantified the uncertainty of the dipole locations using the enclosing volume of the dipole locations and the maximum width of the dipole cluster. Shifting fiducial locations 1.5 cm increased the uncertainty of the dipole locations to span a volume >1 cm3 and about 2.5 cm wide. Results suggest that the fiducials need to be digitized accurately within at least 0.5 cm of the absolute actual fiducial location to limit the uncertainty of a dipole location to <1 cm. Additionally, we used random fiducial shift combinations to estimate the effects of combinations of the fiducial shifts on dipole location estimation. This analysis showed that dipole locations were within the bounds of our dipole estimation uncertainty volumes. Based on the outcomes, we suggest marking fiducials carefully before placement of the cap and to use a digitization method with an accuracy of <0.5 cm.",

    "abstract": "Recent work has highlighted the scale and ubiquity of subject variability in observations from functional MRI data (fMRI). Furthermore, it is highly likely that errors in the estimation of either the spatial presentation of, or the coupling between, functional regions can confound cross-subject analyses, making accurate and unbiased representations of functional data essential for interpreting any downstream analyses.\n\nHere, we extend the framework of probabilistic functional modes (PFMs) [Harrison et al. 2015] to capture cross-subject variability not only in the mode spatial maps, but also in the functional coupling between modes and in mode amplitudes. A new implementation of the inference now also allows for the analysis of modern, large-scale data sets, and the combined inference and analysis package, PROFUMO, is available from git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/samh/profumo. Using simulated data, resting-state data from 1,000 subjects collected as part of the Human Connectome Project [Van Essen et al. 2013], and an analysis of 14 subjects in a variety of continuous task-states [Kieliba et al. 2019], we demonstrate how PFMs are able to capture, within a single model, a rich description of how the spatio-temporal structure of resting-state fMRI activity varies across subjects.\n\nWe also compare the new PFM model to the well established independent component analysis with dual regression (ICA-DR) pipeline. This reveals that, under PFM assumptions, much more of the (behaviorally relevant) cross-subject variability in fMRI activity should be attributed to the variability in spatial maps, and that, after accounting for this, functional coupling between modes primarily reflects current cognitive state. This has fundamental implications for the interpretation of cross-sectional studies of functional connectivity that do not capture cross-subject variability to the same extent as PFMs.",
