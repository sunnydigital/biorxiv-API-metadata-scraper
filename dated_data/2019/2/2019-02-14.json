    "abstract": "The mammalian neocortex is subdivided into a series of  cortical areas that are functionally and anatomically distinct, and are often distinguished in brain sections using histochemical stains and other markers of protein expression. We searched the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas, a database of gene expression, for novel markers of cortical areas. We employed a random forest algorithm to screen for genes that change expression at area borders. We found novel genetic markers for 19 of 39 areas and provide code that quickly and efficiently searches the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas.",

    "abstract": "Hsp90 is an essential chaperone that requires large allosteric changes to determine its ATPase activity and client binding. Because of the inherent low ATPase activity of human Hsp90, the co-chaperone Aha1, which is the only known ATPase stimulator in eukaryotes, is important for regulation of Hsp90s allosteric timing. Little is known, however, about the structure of the Hsp90/Aha1 full-length complex. Here, we characterize the solution structure of unmodified human Hsp90 in complex with Aha1 using NMR spectroscopy. We show that the 214 kDa complex adopts multiple conformations in the absence of nucleotide. Interaction with Aha1 induces structural changes near the nucleotide-binding site in Hsp90s N-terminal domain, providing a basis for its ATPase-enhancing activity. Moreover, the E67K mutation in Aha1 strongly diminishes the interaction, supporting a two-step binding mechanism. Our data reveal important aspects of this pivotal chaperone/co-chaperone interaction and emphasize the relevance of characterizing dynamic chaperone structures in solution.",
