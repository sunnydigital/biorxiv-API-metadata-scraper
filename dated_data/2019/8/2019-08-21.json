    "abstract": "ContextPre-exercise nutrient availability alters acute metabolic responses to exercise, which could modulate training responsiveness. We hypothesised that in men with overweight/obesity, acute exercise before versus after nutrient ingestion would increase whole-body and intramuscular lipid utilization, translating into greater increases in oral glucose insulin sensitivity over 6-weeks of training.\\n\\nDesign and ParticipantsWe showed in men with overweight/obesity (mean{+/-}SD for BMI: 30.2{+/-}3.5 kgxm-2 for acute, crossover study, 30.9{+/-}4.5 kgxm-2 for randomized, controlled, training study) a single exercise bout before versus after nutrient provision increased lipid utilisation at the whole-body level, but also in both type I (p<0.01) and type II muscle fibres (p=0.02). We then used a 6-week training intervention to show sustained, 2-fold increases in lipid utilisation with exercise before versus after nutrient provision (p<0.01).\\n\\nMain Outcome MeasuresPostprandial glycemia was not differentially affected by exercise training before vs after nutrient provision (p>0.05), yet plasma was reduced with exercise training before, but not after nutrient provision (p=0.03), resulting in increased oral glucose insulin sensitivity when training was performed before versus after nutrient provision (25{+/-}38 vs -21{+/-}32 mLxmin-1xm-2; p=0.01) and this was associated with increased lipid utilisation during exercise (r=0.50, p=0.02). Regular exercise prior to nutrient provision augmented remodelling of skeletal muscle phospholipids and protein content of the glucose transport protein GLUT4 (p<0.05).\\n\\nConclusionsExperiments investigating exercise training and metabolic health should consider nutrient-exercise timing, and exercise performed before versus after nutrient intake (i.e., in the fasted state) may exert beneficial effects on lipid utilisation and reduce postprandial insulinemia.\\n\\nPrecisExercise in the fasted-versus fed-state increased intramuscular and whole-body lipid use, translating into increased muscle adaptation and insulin sensitivity when regularly performed over 6 weeks.",

    "abstract": "Adaptation of the islet {beta}-cell insulin secretory response to changing insulin demand is critical for blood glucose homeostasis, yet the mechanisms underlying this adaptation are unknown. Here, we show that nutrient-stimulated histone acetylation plays a key role in adapting insulin secretion through regulation of genes involved in {beta}-cell nutrient sensing and metabolism. Nutrient regulation of the epigenome occurs at sites occupied by the chromatin-modifying enzyme Lsd1 in islets. We demonstrate that {beta}-cell-specific deletion of Lsd1 leads to insulin hypersecretion, aberrant expression of nutrient response genes, and histone hyperacetylation. Islets from mice adapted to chronically increased insulin demand exhibited similar epigenetic and transcriptional changes. Moreover, genetic variants associated with fasting glucose and type 2 diabetes are enriched at LSD1-bound sites in human islets, suggesting that interpretation of nutrient signals is genetically determined. Our findings reveal that adaptive insulin secretion involves Lsd1-mediated coupling of nutrient state to regulation of the islet epigenome.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial respiration generates an electrochemical proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane called the protonmotive force (PMF) to drive diverse functions and make ATP. Current techniques to manipulate the PMF are limited to its dissipation; there is no precise, reversible method to increase the PMF. To address this issue, we used an optogenetic approach and engineered a mitochondria-targeted light-activated proton pumping protein we called mitochondria-ON (mtON) to selectively increase the PMF. Here, mtON increased the PMF light dose-dependently, supported ATP synthesis, increased resistance to mitochondrial toxins, and modulated energy-sensing behavior in Caenorhabditis elegans. Moreover, transient mtON activation during hypoxia prevented the well-characterized adaptive response of hypoxic preconditioning. Our novel optogenetic approach demonstrated that a decreased PMF is both necessary and sufficient for hypoxia-stimulated stress resistance. Our results show that optogenetic manipulation of the PMF is a powerful tool to modulate metabolic and cell signaling outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Bread wheat is one of the most important crops for human diet but the increasing soil salinization is causing yield reductions worldwide. Physiological, genetic, transcriptomics and bioinformatics analyses were integrated to study the salt stress adaptation response in bread wheat. A comparative analysis to uncover the dynamic transcriptomic response of contrasting genotypes from two wheat populations was performed at both osmotic and ionic phases in time points defined by physiologic measurements. The differential stress effect on the expression of photosynthesis, calcium binding and oxidative stress response genes in the contrasting genotypes supported the greater photosynthesis inhibition observed in the susceptible genotype at the osmotic phase. At the ionic phase genes involved in metal ion binding and transporter activity were up-regulated and down-regulated in the tolerant and susceptible genotypes, respectively. The stress effect on mechanisms related with protein synthesis and breakdown was identified at both stress phases. Based on the linkage disequilibrium blocks it was possible to select salt-responsive genes as potential components operating in the salt stress response pathways leading to salt stress resilience specific traits. Therefore, the implementation of a systemic approach provided insights into the adaptation response mechanisms of contrasting bread wheat genotypes at both salt stress phases.\\n\\nHighlightThe implementation of a systemic approach provided insights into salt stress adaptation response mechanisms of contrasting bread wheat genotypes from two mapping populations at both osmotic and ionic phases.",

However, no preclinical studies have identified deficits in rewarded executive function in the commonly used APP/PS1 mouse model. To address this, we assessed 12-26 month old APP/PS1 mice on rewarded reversal and/or extinction tasks. 16-month-old, but not 13- or 26-month-old, APP/PS1 mice showed an attenuated rate of extinction. Reversal deficits were seen in 22-month-old, but not 13-month-old APP/PS1 animals. We then confirmed that impairments in reversal were unrelated to previously reported visual impairments in both AD mouse models and humans. Age, but not genotype, had a significant effect on markers of retinal health, indicating the deficits seen in APP/PS1 mice were directly related to cognition. This is the first characterisation of rewarded executive function in APP/PS1 mice, and has great potential to facilitate translation from preclinical models to the clinic.",

    "abstract": "Most predictions on the evolution of adaptive parental effects and phenotypic memory exclusively focus on the role of the abiotic environment. How parental effects are affected by population demography and life history is less well understood. To overcome this, we use an analytical model to assess whether selection acting on fecundity versus viability affects the evolution of parental effects in a viscous population experiencing a spatiotemporally varying environment. We find that parental effects commonly evolve in regimes of viability selection, but are less likely to evolve in regimes of fecundity selection. In regimes of viability selection, an individuals phenotype becomes correlated with its local environment during its lifetime, as those individuals with a locally adapted phenotype are more likely to survive until parenthood. Hence, a parental phenotype rapidly becomes an informative cue about its local environment, favoring the evolution of parental effects. By contrast, in regimes of fecundity selection, locally maladapted and adapted parents survive at equal rates, so that the parental phenotype, by itself, is not informative about the local environment. Correlations between phenotype and environment still arise, but only when more fecund, locally adapted individuals leave more successfully established offspring to the local patch. Hence, correlations take at least two generations to develop, making them more sensitive to distortion by environmental change or competition with immigrant offspring. Hence, we conclude that viability selection is most conducive to the evolution of adaptive parental effects in spatially structured populations.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWMouse lemurs (Microcebus) are a radiation of morphologically cryptic primates distributed throughout Madagascar for which the number of recognized species has exploded in the past two decades. This taxonomic explosion has prompted understandable concern that there has been substantial oversplitting in the mouse lemur clade. Here, we take an integrative approach to investigate species diversity in two pairs of sister lineages that occur in a region in northeastern Madagascar with high levels of microendemism and predicted habitat loss. We analyzed RADseq data with multispecies coalescent (MSC) species delimitation methods for three named species and an undescribed lineage previously identified to have divergent mtDNA. Marked differences in effective population sizes, levels of gene flow, patterns of isolation-by-distance, and species delimitation results were found among them. Whereas all tests support the recognition of the presently undescribed lineage as a separate species, the species-level distinction of two previously described species, M. mittermeieri and M. lehilahytsara is not supported - a result that is particularly striking when using the genealogical discordance index (gdi). Non-sister lineages occur sympatrically in two of the localities sampled for this study, despite an estimated divergence time of less than 1 Ma. This suggests rapid evolution of reproductive isolation in the focal lineages, and in the mouse lemur clade generally. The divergence time estimates reported here are based on the MSC and calibrated with pedigree-based mutation rates and are considerably more recent than previously published fossil-calibrated concatenated likelihood estimates, however. We discuss the possible explanations for this discrepancy, noting that there are theoretical justifications for preferring the MSC estimates in this case.",

    "abstract": "The superb fairy-wren, Malurus cyaneus, is one of the most iconic Australian passerine species. This species belongs to an endemic Australasian clade, Meliphagides, which diversified early in the evolution of the oscine passerines. Today, the oscine passerines comprise almost half of all avian species diversity. Despite the rapid increase of available bird genome assemblies, this part of the avian tree has not yet been represented by a high-quality reference. To rectify that, we present the first chromosome-scale genome assembly of a Meliphagides representative: the superb fairy-wren. We combined Illumina shotgun and mate-pair sequences, PacBio long-reads, and a genetic linkage map from an intensively sampled pedigree of a wild population to generate this genome assembly. Of the final assembled 1.07Gb genome, 894Mb (84.8%) was anchored onto 25 chromosomes resulting in a final scaffold N50 of 68.11 Mb. This high-quality bird genome assembly is also one of only a handful which is also accompanied by a genetic map and recombination landscape. In comparison to other pedigree-based bird genetic maps, we find that the zebrafinch (Taeniopygia) genetic map more closely resembles the fairy-wren map rather than the map from the more closely-related Ficedula flycatcher. Lastly, we also provide a predictive gene and repeat annotation of the genome assembly. This new high quality, annotated genome assembly will be an invaluable resource not only to the superb fairy-wren species and relatives but also broadly across the avian tree by providing a new reference point for comparative genomic analyses.",

Although there is still no clear main function of circRNAs, several studies have revealed that circRNAs are expressed in a variety of eukaryotic organisms, demonstrate conservation across species, and are expressed in a regulated manner often independent of their parental linear isoforms. circNFATC3, an abundant and uncharacterized circular isoform of NFATC3 gene (which is formed form backsplicing of exon 2 and 3) in solid tumors was identified from transcriptomic data. Here we show that circNFATC3 gain of and loss of function experiments using RNAi mediated circRNA silencing and circular mini vector-mediated overexpression of circularized constructs in breast and ovarian cancer cell lines affects molecular phenotypes. Knockdown of circNFATC3 induces a reduction in cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and oxidative phosphorylation. Gain of function of circNFATc3 in MDA-MB -231 cells and SKOV3 cells shows a significant increase in cell proliferation, migration, and respiration. The above results suggest that circNFATC3 is a functionally relevant circular RNA in cancer",

For part 1, evidence of entrainment or any influence of the embedding rhythm were examined on the stability or attractor location. The estimations from the dynamics of the relative phase between the two oscillations show that while (i) circadian effects under the artificially perturbed manipulation were not straightforward along the day-night temperature cycle, (ii) the circadian effect divided by the ordinary circadian seems to be constant along the day-night cycle. Corresponding to this evidence related to performance consequences depending on the organism and environmental interaction, the part 2 determined the impact of circadian (mis)alignment on biological functions and raised the possibility that the disruption of circadian systems may contribute to physical complications. The observations entail rules that self-attunement of current performance may develop not at a single component but across many nested, inter-connected scales. These inter-dependencies from different object phase may allow a potential context-dependent explanation for goal-oriented movements and the emergent assumption of a principle of organisms embedded into their environmental contexts.",

    "abstract": "RUNX3 is one of three mammalian Runt-domain transcription factors (TFs) that regulate gene expression in several types of immune cells. Runx3-deficiency in mice is associated with a multitude of defects in the adaptive and innate immunity systems, including the development of early onset colitis. Our study reveals that conditional deletion of Runx3 specifically in mononuclear phagocytes (MNP) (MNPRunx3-/-) but not in T cells, recapitulates the early onset spontaneous colitis seen in Runx3-/- mice.\\n\\nWe show that Runx3 is expressed in colonic MNP, including resident macrophages (RM) and the dendritic cell cDC2 subsets and its loss results in impaired differentiation/maturation of both cell types. At the transcriptome level, loss of Runx3 in RM and cDC2 was associated with upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes similar to those in the early onset IBD murine model of RMIl10r-/-. The impaired RM maturation in the absence of Runx3 was associated with a marked decrease in expression of anti-inflammatory and TGF{beta}-regulated genes. Similarly, the decreased expression of {beta}-catenin signaling associated genes in Runx3-deficient cDC2 indicates their impaired differentiation/maturation. Analysis of ChIP-seq data suggests that in both MNP cell types a significant fraction of these differentially expressed genes are high confidence Runx3 directly regulated genes. Interestingly, several of these putative Runx3 target genes harbor SNPs associated with IBD susceptibility in humans. Remarkably, the impaired maturation and pro-inflammatory phenotype of MNP lacking Runx3 was associated with a substantial reduction in the prevalence of colonic lamina propria Foxp3+ regulatory T cells and an increase in IFN{gamma}-producing CD4+ T cells, underscoring Runx3 critical role in establishing tolerogenic MNP.\\n\\nTogether, these data emphasize the dual role of Runx3 in colonic MNP, as a transcriptional repressor of pro-inflammatory genes and an activator of maturation-associated genes including anti-inflammatory genes. Our study highlights the significance of the current MNPRunx3-/- model for understanding of human MNP-associated colitis. It provides new insights into the crucial involvement of Runx3 in intestinal immune tolerance by regulating colonic MNP maturation through TGF{beta}R signaling and anti-inflammatory functions by Il10R signaling, befitting the identification of RUNX3 as a genome-wide associated risk gene for various immune-related diseases in humans including gastrointestinal tract diseases such as celiac and Crohns disease.",

    "abstract": "Hearing loss is a problem that impacts a significant proportion of the adult population. Cochlear hair cell loss due to loud noise, chemotherapy and aging is the major underlying cause. A significant proportion of these individuals are dissatisfied with available treatment options which include hearing aids and cochlear implants. An alternative approach to restore hearing would be to regenerate hair cells. Such therapy would require recapitulation of the complex architecture of the organ of Corti, necessitating regeneration of both mature hair cells and supporting cells. Transcriptional profiles of the mature cell types in the cochlea are necessary to can provide a metric for eventual regeneration therapies. To assist in this effort, we sought to provide the first single-cell characterization of the adult cochlear supporting cell transcriptome. We performed single-cell RNA-Seq on FACS-purified adult cochlear supporting cells from the LfngEGFP adult mouse, in which supporting cells express GFP. We demonstrate that adult cochlear supporting cells are transcriptionally distinct from their perinatal counterparts. We establish cell type-specific adult cochlear supporting cell transcriptome profiles, and we validate these expression profiles through a combination of both fluorescent immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization co-localization and qPCR of adult cochlear supporting cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate the relevance of these profiles to the adult human cochlea through immunofluorescent human temporal bone histopathology. Finally, we demonstrate cell cycle regulator expression in adult supporting cells and perform pathway analyses to identify potential mechanisms for facilitating mitotic regeneration (cell proliferation, differentiation, and eventually regeneration) in the adult mammalian cochlea. Our findings demonstrate the importance of characterizing mature as opposed to perinatal supporting cells.",

    "abstract": "The signals feeding into bacterial S-phase transcription are poorly understood. Cellular cycling in the alpha-proteobacterium Caulobacter crescentus is driven by a complex circuit of at least three transcriptional modules that direct sequential promoter firing during the G1, early and late S cell cycle phases. In alpha-proteobacteria, the transcriptional regulator GcrA and the CcrM methyltransferase epigenetically activate promoters of cell division and polarity genes that fire in S-phase. By evolving Caulobacter crescentus cells to cycle and differentiate in the absence of the GcrA/CcrM module, we discovered that phosphate deprivation and (p)ppGpp alarmone stress signals converge on S-phase transcriptional activation. The cell cycle oscillations of the CtrA protein, the transcriptional regulator that implements G1 and late S-phase transcription, are essential in our evolved mutants, but not in wild-type cells, showing that the periodicity in CtrA abundance alone can sustain cellular cycling without GcrA/CcrM. While similar nutritional sensing occurs in other alpha-proteobacteria, GcrA and CcrM are not encoded in the reduced genomes of obligate intracellular relatives. We thus propose that the nutritional stress response induced during intracellular growth obviated the need for an S-phase transcriptional regulator.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTThe self-produced biofilm provides beneficial protection for the enclosed cells, but the costly production of matrix components makes producer cells susceptible to cheating by non-producing individuals. Despite detrimental effects of non-producers, biofilms can be heterogeneous, with isogenic non-producers being a natural consequence of phenotypic differentiation processes. For instance, in Bacillus subtilis biofilm cells differ in the two major matrix components production, the amyloid fiber protein TasA and exopolysaccharides (EPS), demonstrating different expression levels of corresponding matrix genes. This raises questions regarding matrix gene expression dynamics during biofilm development and the impact of phenotypic non-producers on biofilm robustness. Here, we show that biofilms are structurally heterogeneous and can be separated into strongly and weakly associated clusters. We reveal that spatiotemporal changes in structural heterogeneity correlate with matrix gene expression, with TasA playing a key role in biofilm integrity and timing of development. We show that the matrix remains partially privatized by the producer subpopulation, where cells tightly stick together even when exposed to shear stress. Our results support previous findings on the existence of \u2018weak points\u2019 in seemingly robust biofilms as well as on the key role of linkage proteins in biofilm formation. Furthermore, we provide a starting point for investigating the privatization of common goods within isogenic populations.IMPORTANCE Biofilms are communities of bacteria protected by a self-produced extracellular matrix. The detrimental effects of non-producing individuals on biofilm development raises questions about the dynamics between community members, especially when isogenic non-producers exist within wild-type populations. We asked ourselves whether phenotypic non-producers impact biofilm robustness, and where and when this heterogeneity of matrix gene expression occurs. Based on our results we propose that the matrix remains partly privatized by the producing subpopulation, since producing cells stick together when exposed to shear stress. The important role of linkage proteins in robustness and development of the structurally heterogeneous biofilm provides an entry into studying the privatization of common goods within isogenic populations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

Most of them also share homologous packaging ATPases of the FtsK/HerA superfamily P-loop ATPases. Remarkably, members of this lineage infect hosts from the three domains of life, suggesting that viruses from this lineage could be very ancient and share a common ancestor. Here we analyzed the evolutionary history of these cosmopolitan viruses by inferring phylogenies based on single or concatenated genes. These viruses can be divided into two supergroups infecting either eukaryotes or prokaryotes. The latter can be further divided into two groups of bacterioviruses and one group of archaeoviruses. This viral tree is thus incongruent with the cellular tree of life in which Archaea are closer to Eukarya and more divergent from Bacteria.

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that mitochondria play a critical role in driving innate immune responses against bacteria and viruses. However, it is unclear if differential reprogramming of mitochondrial function contributes to the fine tuning of pathogen specific immune responses. Here, we found that TLR3 and TLR4 engagement on murine bone marrow derived macrophages was associated with differential remodeling of electron transport chain complex expression. This remodeling was associated with differential accumulation of mitochondrial and cytosolic ROS, which were required to support ligand specific inflammatory and antiviral cytokine production. We also found that the magnitude of TLR3, but not TLR4, responses were modulated by glucose availability. Under conditions of low glucose conditions, TLR3 engagement was associated with increased ETC complex III expression, increased mitochondrial and cytosolic ROS and increased inflammatory and antiviral cytokine production. This amplification was selectively reversed by targeting superoxide production from the outer Q-binding site of the ETC complex III. These results suggest that ligand specific modulation of the ETC may act as a rheostat that fine-tunes innate immune responses via mitochondrial ROS production. Modulation of these processes may represent a novel mechanism to modulate the nature as well as the magnitude of antiviral versus inflammatory immune responses.",

    "abstract": "Oenocytes are an insect cell type having diverse physiological functions ranging from cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) production to insecticide detoxification that may impact their capacity to transmit pathogens. To develop functional genetic tools to study Anopheles gambiae oenocytes, we have trapped an oenocyte enhancer to create a transgenic mosquito Gal4 driver line that mediates tissue-specific expression. After crossing with UAS-reporter lines, An. gambiae oenocytes are fluorescently tagged through all life stages and demonstrate clearly the two characteristic oenocyte cell-types arising during development. The driver was then used to characterise the function of two oenocyte expressed An. gambiae cyp4g genes through tissue-specific expression of UAS-RNAi constructs. Silencing of cyp4g16 or cyp4g17 caused lethality in pupae of differing timing and penetrance. Surviving cyp4g16 knockdown adults showed increased sensitivity to desiccation. Total cuticular hydrocarbon levels were reduced by approximately 80% or 50% in both single gene knockdowns when assayed in young pupa or surviving adults respectively, indicating both genes are required for complete CHC production in An. gambiae and demonstrate synergistic activity in young pupae. Comparative CHC profiles were very similar for the two knockdowns, indicating overlapping substrate specificities of the two enzymes. Differences were observed for example with reduced abundance of shorter chain CHCs in CYP4G16 knockdowns, and reduction in longer, branched chained CHCs in CYP4G17 knockdown adults. This is the first time that two cyp4gs have both been shown to be required for complete CHC production in an insect. Moreover, the generation of tagged cells and identification of an enhancer region can expediate oenocyte specific transcriptomics. The novel driver line can also be used to explore oenocyte roles in pheromone production, mating behaviour and longevity in the malaria mosquito.",

    "abstract": "Biological nitrogen fixation emerging from the symbiosis between bacteria and crop plants holds a significant promise to increase the sustainability of agriculture. One of the biggest hurdles for the engineering of nitrogen-fixing organisms is to identify the metabolic blueprint for symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Here, we report on the CATCH-N cycle, a novel metabolic network based on co-catabolism of plant-provided arginine and succinate to drive the energy-demanding process of symbiotic nitrogen fixation in endosymbiotic rhizobia. Using systems biology, isotope labeling studies and transposon sequencing in conjunction with biochemical characterization, we uncovered highly redundant network components of the CATCH-N cycle including transaminases that interlink the co-catabolism of arginine and succinate. The CATCH-N cycle shares aspects with plant mitochondrial arginine degradation path-way. However, it uses N2 as an additional sink for reductant and therefore delivers up to 25% higher yields of nitrogen than classical arginine catabolism -- two alanines and three ammonium ions are secreted for each input of arginine and succinate. We argue that the CATCH-N cycle has evolved as part of a specific mechanism to sustain bacterial metabolism in the microoxic and acid environment of symbiosomes. In sum, our systems-level findings provide the theoretical framework and enzymatic blueprint for the rational design of plants and plant-associated organisms with new properties for improved nitrogen fixation.\\n\\nSignificance StatementSymbiotic bacteria assimilate nitrogen from the air and fix it into a form that can be used by plants in a process known as biological nitrogen fixation. In agricultural systems, this process is restricted mainly to legumes, yet there is considerable interest in exploring whether similar symbioses can be developed in non-legumes including cereals and other important crop plants. Here we present systems-level findings on the minimal metabolic function set for biological nitrogen fixation that provides the theoretical framework for rational engineering of novel organisms with improved nitrogen-fixing capabilities.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundChest pain is one of the most common complaints among patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). Causes of chest pain can be benign or life threatening, making accurate risk stratification a critical issue in the ED. In addition to the use of established clinical scores, prior studies have attempted to create predictive models with heart rate variability (HRV). In this study, we proposed heart rate n-variability (HRnV), an alternative representation of beat-to-beat variation in electrocardiogram (ECG) and investigated its association with major adverse cardiac events (MACE) for ED patients with chest pain.\n\nMethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis of data collected from the ED of a tertiary hospital in Singapore between September 2010 and July 2015. Patients >20 years old who presented to the ED with chief complaint of chest pain were conveniently recruited. Five to six-minute single-lead ECGs, demographics, medical history, troponin, and other required variables were collected. We developed the HRnV-Calc software to calculate HRnV parameters. The primary outcome was 30-day MACE, which included all-cause death, acute myocardial infarction, and revascularization. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to investigate the association between individual risk factors and the outcome. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to compare the HRnV model (based on leave-one-out cross-validation) against other clinical scores in predicting 30-day MACE.\n\nResultsA total of 795 patients were included in the analysis, of which 247 (31%) had MACE within 30 days. The MACE group was older and had a higher proportion of male patients. Twenty-one conventional HRV and 115 HRnV parameters were calculated. In univariable analysis, eleven HRV parameters and 48 HRnV parameters were significantly associated with 30-day MACE. The multivariable stepwise logistic regression identified 16 predictors that were strongly associated with the MACE outcome; these predictors consisted of one HRV, seven HRnV parameters, troponin, ST segment changes, and several other factors. The HRnV model outperformed several clinical scores in the ROC analysis.\n\nConclusionsThe novel HRnV representation demonstrated its value of augmenting HRV and traditional risk factors in designing a robust risk stratification tool for patients with chest pain at the ED.",

    "abstract": "The last decade has witnessed a swiftly increasing interest in the design and production of novel multivalent molecules as powerful alternatives for conventional antibodies in the fight against cancer and infectious diseases. However, while it is widely accepted that large-scale flexibility (10 - 100 nm) and free/constrained dynamics (100 ns - {micro}s) control the activity of such novel molecules, computational strategies at the mesoscale still lag behind experiments in optimizing the design of crucial features, such as the binding cooperativity (a.k.a. avidity).\\n\\nIn this study, we introduced different coarse-grained models of a polymer-linked, two-nanobody composite molecule, with the aim of laying down the physical bases of a thorough computational drug design protocol at the mesoscale. We show that the calculation of suitable potentials of mean force allows one to apprehend the nature, range and strength of the thermodynamic forces that govern the motion of free and wall-tethered molecules. Furthermore, we develop a simple computational strategy to quantify the encounter/dissociation dynamics between the free end of a wall-tethered molecule and the surface, at the roots of binding cooperativity. This procedure allows one to pinpoint the role of internal flexibility and weak non-specific interactions on the kinetic constants of the NB-wall encounter and dissociation. Finally, we quantify the role and weight of rare events, which are expected to play a major role in real-life situations, such as in the immune synapse, where the binding kinetics is likely dominated by fluctuations.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEMultivalent and multispecific molecules composed of polymer-linked nanobodies have gained interest as engineered alternatives to conventional antibodies. These therapeutic molecules have a larger reach due to their smaller size and promise substantial and tunable gains in avidity.

    "abstract": "MotivationIdentifying structural variants (SVs) is of critical importance in health and disease, however, detecting them remains a scientific and computing challenge. Several linked-read sequencing technologies, including 10X linked-read, TELL-Seq, and single tube long fragment read (stLFR), have been recently developed as cost-effective approaches to reconstruct multi-megabase haplotypes (phase blocks) from sequence data of a single sample. These technologies provide an optimal sequencing platform to characterize SVs, though few computational algorithms can utilize them. Thus, we developed Aquila_stLFR, an approach that resolves SVs through haplotype-based assembly of stLFR linked-reads.\n\nResultsAquila_stLFR first partitions LFRs into two haplotype-specific blocks, by taking advantage of the potential phasing ability of the linked-read itself. Each haplotype is then assembled independently, to achieve a complete diploid assembly to finally reconstruct the genome-wide SVs. We benchmarked Aquila_stLFR on a well-studied sample, NA24385, and showed Aquila_stLFR can detect medium to large size (50bp - 10kb) deletions with a high sensitivity and insertions with a high specificity.\n\nAvailabilitySource code and documentation are available on https://github.com/maiziex/Aquila_stLFR.\n\nContactmaizie.zhou@vanderbilt.edu\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "Point scanning imaging systems (e.g. scanning electron or laser scanning confocal microscopes) are perhaps the most widely used tools for high resolution cellular and tissue imaging. Like all other imaging modalities, the resolution, speed, sample preservation, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of point scanning systems are difficult to optimize simultaneously. In particular, point scanning systems are uniquely constrained by an inverse relationship between imaging speed and pixel resolution. Here we show these limitations can be mitigated via the use of deep learning-based super-sampling of undersampled images acquired on a point-scanning system, which we termed point-scanning super-resolution (PSSR) imaging. Oversampled, high SNR ground truth images acquired on scanning electron or Airyscan laser scanning confocal microscopes were  crappified to generate semi-synthetic training data for PSSR models that were then used to restore real-world undersampled images. Remarkably, our EM PSSR model could restore undersampled images acquired with different optics, detectors, samples, or sample preparation methods in other labs. PSSR enabled previously unattainable 2 nm resolution images with our serial block face scanning electron microscope system. For fluorescence, we show that undersampled confocal images combined with a multiframe PSSR model trained on Airyscan timelapses facilitates Airyscan-equivalent spatial resolution and SNR with [~]100x lower laser dose and 16x higher frame rates than corresponding high-resolution acquisitions. In conclusion, PSSR facilitates point-scanning image acquisition with otherwise unattainable resolution, speed, and sensitivity.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=116 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/740548v8_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (90K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fbf19aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b2cc88org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@921e1corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f6c5af_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) receptor protein (Crp) is an important transcriptional regulator of Yersinia pestis. Expression of crp increases during pneumonic plague as the pathogen depletes glucose and forms large biofilms within lungs. To better understand control of Y. pestis Crp, we determined a 1.8 [A] crystal structure of the protein-cAMP complex. We found that compared to Escherichia coli Crp, C helix amino acid substitutions in Y. pestis Crp did not impact cAMP dependency of Crp to bind DNA promoters. To investigate Y. pestis Crp-regulated genes during plague pneumonia, we performed RNA-sequencing on both wild-type and {Delta}crp mutant bacteria growing in planktonic and biofilm states in minimal media with glucose or glycerol. Y. pestis Crp is found to dramatically alter expression of hundreds of genes dependent upon carbon source and growth state. Gel shift assays confirmed direct regulation of the malT and ptsG promoters and Crp was then linked to Y. pestis growth on maltose as a sole carbon source. Iron-regulation genes ybtA and fyuA were found to be indirectly regulated by Crp. A new connection between carbon source and quorum sensing was revealed as Crp was found to regulate production of acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) through direct and indirect regulation of genes for AHL synthetases and receptors. AHLs were subsequently identified in the lungs of Y. pestis infected mice when crp expression is highest in Y. pestis biofilms. Thus, in addition to well-studied pla, other Crp-regulated genes likely have important functions during plague infection.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEBacterial pathogens have evolved extensive signaling pathways to translate environmental signals into changes in gene expression. While Crp has long been appreciated for its role in regulating metabolism of carbon sources in many bacterial species, transcriptional profiling has revealed that this protein regulates many other aspects of bacterial physiology. The plague pathogen, Y. pestis, requires this global regulator to survive in blood, skin, and lungs. During disease progression, this organism adapts to changes within these niches. In addition to regulating genes for metabolism of non-glucose sugars, we find the Crp regulates genes for virulence, metal acquisition and quorum sensing by direct or indirect mechanisms. Thus, this single transcriptional regulator, that responds to changes in available carbon sources, can regulate multiple critical behaviors for causing disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMicrobial contamination impedes successful biological and biomedical research. Computational approaches utilizing next-generation sequencing (NGS) data offer promising diagnostics to assess the presence of contaminants. However, as host cells are often contaminated by multiple microorganisms, these approaches require careful attention to intra- and interspecies sequence similarities, which have not yet been fully addressed.\\n\\nResultsWe present a computational approach that rigorously investigates the genomic origins of sequenced reads, including those mapped to multiple species that have been discarded in previous studies. Through the analysis of large-scale synthetic and public NGS samples, we approximated that 1,000-100,000 microbial reads prevail when one million host reads are sequenced by RNA-seq. The microbe catalog we established included Cutibacterium as a prevalent contaminant, suggesting that contamination mostly originates from the laboratory environment. Importantly, by applying a systematic method to infer the functional impact of contamination, we revealed that host-contaminant interactions cause profound changes in the host molecular landscapes, as exemplified by changes in inflammatory and apoptotic pathways during Mycoplasma infection.\\n\\nConclusionsThese findings reinforce the concept that precise determination of the origins and functional impacts of contamination is imperative for quality research and illustrate the usefulness of the proposed approach to comprehensively characterize contamination landscapes.",

    "abstract": "Uveal melanoma (UM) is a rare form of melanoma with a genetics and immunology that is different from skin melanoma. Previous studies have identified genetic driver events of early stage disease when the tumor is confined to the eye. However due to lack of a clinical rationale to biopsy metastatic disease, access to tumor material to perform molecular profiling of metastases has been limited. In this study, we have characterized genomic events in UM metastases using whole-genome sequencing of fresh frozen biopsies from thirty-two patients and profiled the transcriptomes of individual tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in eight patients by single-cell sequencing. We find that 91% of the patients have metastases carrying inactivating events in the tumor suppressor BAP1 and this coincided with somatic alterations in GNAQ, GNA11, CYSLTR2, PLCB4, SF3B1 and/or CDKN2A. Mutational signature analysis revealed a rare subset of tumors with prominent signs of UV damage, associated with outlier mutational burden. We study copy number variations (CNV) and find overrepresented events, some of which were not altered in matched primary eye tumors. A focused siRNA screen identified functionally significant genes of some of the segments recurrently gained. We reintroduced a functional copy of BAP1 into a patient-derived BAP1 deficient tumor cell line and found broad transcriptomic changes of genes associated with subtype distinction and prognosis in primary UM. Lastly, our analysis of the immune microenvironments of metastases revealed a presence of tumor-reactive T cells. However, a majority expressed the immune checkpoint receptors TIM-3, LAG3 and TIGIT, and to a lesser extent PD-1. These results provide an updated view of genomic events represented in metastatic UM and immune interactions in advanced lesions.",

    "abstract": "Seminal fluid proteins (SFPs) exert potent effects on male and female fitness. Rapidly evolving and molecularly diverse, they derive from multiple male secretory cells and tissues. In Drosophila melanogaster, most SFPs are produced in the accessory glands, which are composed of [~]1000 fertility-enhancing  main cells and [~]40, more functionally cryptic,  secondary cells. Inhibition of BMP-signalling in secondary cells suppresses secretion, leading to a unique uncoupling of normal female post-mating responses to the ejaculate: refractoriness stimulation is impaired, but offspring production is not. Secondary cell secretions might therefore make a highly specific contribution to the seminal proteome and ejaculate function; alternatively, they might regulate more global - but hitherto-undiscovered - SFP functions and proteome composition. Here, we present data that supports the latter model. We show that in addition to previously reported phenotypes, secondary cell-specific BMP-signalling inhibition compromises sperm storage and increases female sperm use efficiency. It also impacts second male sperm, tending to slow entry into storage and delay ejection. First male paternity is enhanced, which suggests a novel constraint on ejaculate evolution whereby high female refractoriness and sperm competitiveness are mutually exclusive. Using quantitative proteomics, we reveal a mix of specific and widespread changes to the seminal proteome that surprisingly encompass alterations to main cell-derived proteins, indicating important cross-talk between classes of SFP-secreting cells. Our results demonstrate that ejaculate composition and function emerge from the integrated action of multiple secretory cell-types suggesting that modification to the cellular make-up of seminal fluid-producing tissues is an important factor in ejaculate evolution.",

    "abstract": "Many plants emit diverse floral scents that mediate plant-environment interactions and attain reproductive success. However, how plants evolve novel adaptive floral volatiles remains unclear. Here, we show that in the wild tobacco, Nicotiana attenuata, a dominant species-specific floral volatile (benzyl acetone, BA) that attracts pollinators and deters florivore is synthesized by phenylalanine ammonia-lyase 4 (NaPAL4), isoflavone reductase 3 (NaIFR3), and chalcone synthase 3 (NaCHAL3). Transient expression of NaFIR3 alone in N. attenuata leaves is sufficient and necessary for ectopic foliar BA emissions, and the BA emission level is increased by co-expressing NaIFR3 with NaPAL4 and NaCHAL3. Independent changes in transcription in all three genes contributed to intraspecific variations of floral BA emission. However, among species, the gain-of-expression in NaIFR3 resulted in the biosynthesis of BA that was only found in N. attenuata. This study suggests that novel metabolic pathways associated with adaptation can arise via re-configurations of gene expression.",

    "abstract": "As witnessed by various population-scale cancer genome sequencing projects, accurate discovery of somatic variants has become of central importance in modern cancer research. However, count statistics on somatic insertions and deletions (indels) discovered so far point out that large amounts of discoveries must have been missed. The reason is that the combination of uncertainties relating to, for example, gap and alignment ambiguities, twilight zone indels, cancer heterogeneity, sample purity, sampling and strand bias are hard to accurately quantify. Here, a unifying statistical model is provided whose dependency structures enable to accurately quantify all inherent uncertainties in short time. As major consequence, false discovery rate (FDR) in somatic indel discovery can now be controlled at utmost accuracy. As demonstrated on simulated and real data, this enables to dramatically increase the amount of true discoveries while safely suppressing the FDR. Specifically supported by workflow design, our approach can be integrated as a post-processing step in large-scale projects.\\n\\nThe software is publicly available at https://varlociraptor.github.io and can be easily installed via Bioconda1 [Gruning et al., 2018].",

Most of the research in past decades have focused on particular brain region function, but the interaction between these has a major role in human cognition.

The connectivity between brain regions is estimated from scalp electroencephalography signals that were recorded from twenty-three healthy subject participated in recognition memory task to correctly classify old/new words. Multivariate autoregressive models (MVAR) are used for the determination of Granger causality to estimate the effective connectivity in the time-frequency domain. We use GPDC and dDTF methods because they have almost resolved the previous problems in estimations. Results show that brain regions in the old condition have greater global connectivity in the theta and gamma band compared to the new words retrieval. Connectivity within and between the brains hemisphere may be related to correct rejection. The left frontal has a crucial role in recollection. theta and gamma specific connectivity pattern between temporal, parietal and frontal cortex may disclose the retrieval mechanism. old/new comparison resulted in the different patterns of network connection.

In particular, adenosine A1 receptor (A1AR) is an important therapeutic target for treating cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injuries, neuropathic pain and renal diseases. As a prototypical GPCR, the A1AR is located within a phospholipid membrane bilayer and transmits cellular signals by changing between different conformational states. It is important to elucidate the lipid-protein interactions in order to understand the functional mechanism of GPCRs. Here, all-atom simulations using a robust Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD) method were performed on both the inactive (antagonist bound) and active (agonist and G protein bound) A1AR, which was embedded in a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) lipid bilayer. In the GaMD simulations, the membrane lipids played a key role in stabilizing different conformational states of the A1AR. Our simulations further identified important regions of the receptor that interacted distinctly with the lipids in highly correlated manner. Activation of the A1AR led to differential dynamics in the upper and lower leaflets of the lipid bilayer. In summary, GaMD enhanced simulations have revealed strongly coupled dynamics of the GPCR and lipids that depend on the receptor activation state.",

Mass spectrometry coupled with liquid chromatography is a powerful and sensitive approach but its application to complex biological samples remains challenging.\\n\\nThe aim of this work was to develop improved methods for detection of OxPLs, specifically by using targeted mass spectrometry approaches (precursor ion [PIS] and neutral loss [NL] scanning), high resolution mass spectrometry and alternative chromatographic approaches. Initial experiments were carried out using oxidation products generated in vitro from a commercially available phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) mixture in order to optimise the chromatography separation parameters and mass spectrometry parameters. The chromatographic separation of oxidised phosphatidylcholines (OxPCs) and oxidised phosphatidylethanolamines (OXPEs) was evaluated using C8, C18 and C30 reverse phase, polystyrene - divinylbenzene based monolithic and mixed - mode hydrophilic interaction (HILIC) columns, interfaced with mass spectrometry. Our results suggest that the divinylbenzene based reverse phase monolithic column gave best separation of short chain OxPCs and OxPEs from long chain oxidised and native PCs and PEs.\\n\\nTargeted mass spectrometric approaches for the selective identification of short chain OxPCs using PIS for m/z 184 Da and NL for m/z 34 Da for identification of hydroperoxides were tested on OxPC mixture, it enabled identification of low abundant oxidation products such as: {gamma}-hydroxy alkenals and alkenoates and saturated aldehydes collectively termed as \\\"short - chain oxidation products\\\" such as PONPC, POVPC and HOOA-PC. The combination of these chromatographic and MS methods allowed identification of several oxidised molecular species in plasma of diabetic patients. Quantitative differences in oxidised products were observed in diabetic samples and the trend showed high abundance of oxidised phosphatidylcholine species in diabetic samples, compared to healthy plasma samples. However, the difference in abundance was statistically not significant when the samples were analysed using Progenesis QI software, performing global normalisation and ANOVA analysis because of inherent biological variability observed for OxPC species in samples.",

    "abstract": "PurposeCurrent sequencing strategies can genetically solve 55-60% of inherited retinal degeneration (IRD) cases, despite recent progress in sequencing. This can partially be attributed to elusive pathogenic variants (PVs) in known IRD genes, including copy number variations (CNVs), which we believe are a major contributor to unsolved IRD cases.\\n\\nMethodsFive hundred IRD patients were analyzed with targeted next generation sequencing (NGS). The NGS data was used to detect CNVs with ExomeDepth and gCNV and the results were compared to CNV detection with a SNP-Array. Likely causal CNV predictions were validated by quantitative (q)PCR.\\n\\nResultsLikely disease-causing single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small indels were found in 55.8% of subjects. PVs in USH2A (11.6%), RPGR (4%) and EYS (4%) were the most common. Likely causal CNVs were found in an additional 8.8% of patients. Of the three CNV detection methods, gCNV showed the highest accuracy. Approximately 30% of unsolved subjects had a single likely PV in a recessive IRD gene.\\n\\nConclusionsCNV detection using NGS-based algorithms is a reliable method that greatly increases the genetic diagnostic rate of IRDs. Experimentally validating CNVs helps estimate the rate at which IRDs might be solved by a CNV plus a more elusive variant.",

    "abstract": "Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) is an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin. Regulation of monoamine neurotransmitter abundance through MAOA activity strongly affects motor control, emotion, and cognitive function. Mutations in MAOA cause Brunner Syndrome, which is characterized by impulsive aggressive behavior and mild intellectual disability (ID). The impaired MAOA activity in Brunner Syndrome patients results in bioamine aberration, but it is currently unknown how this affects neuronal function. MAOA is highly expressed in serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons, and dysfunction of both neurotransmission systems is associated with aggressive behavior in mice and humans. Research has so far mainly focused on the serotonergic system. Here, we generated human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived induced dopaminergic neurons (iDANs) from individuals with known MAOA mutations, to investigate MAOA-dependent effects on dopamine neuronal function in the context of Brunner Syndrome. We assessed iDAN lines from three patients and combined data from morphological analysis, gene expression, single-cell electrophysiology, and network analysis using micro-electrode arrays (MEAs). We observed mutation-dependent functional effects as well as overlapping changes in iDAN morphology. The most striking effect was a clear increase in N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor mRNA expression in all patient lines. A marked increase was also seen in coordinated network activity (network bursts) on the MEA in all patient lines, while single-cell intrinsic properties and spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents activity appeared normal. Together, our data indicate that dysfunction of MAOA leads to increased coordinated network activity in iDANs, possibly caused by increased synaptic NMDA receptor expression.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial cancer therapy (BCT) shows great promise for treatment of solid tumors, yet basic mechanisms of bacterial-induced tumor suppression remain undefined. The intestinal epithelium is the natural route of infection for Salmonella and thus harbors innate immune defenses which protect against infection. Attenuated strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm) have commonly been used in mouse models of BCT, largely with the use of xenograft and orthotopic transplant cancer models. We aimed to better understand the tumor epithelium-targeted mechanisms of BCT by using mouse models of intestinal tumorigenesis and tumor organoid cultures to assess the effectiveness and mechanisms of treatment with aromatase A-deficient STm (STm{Delta}aroA). STm{Delta}aroA delivered by oral gavage could significantly reduce tumor burden and tumor load in both a colitis-associated colon cancer model (CAC) and in a spontaneous intestinal cancer model, Apcmin/+ mice. STm{Delta}aroA colonization of tumors caused alterations in transcription of mRNAs associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition as well as metabolic and cell cycle-related transcripts. Metabolomic analysis of tumors demonstrated alteration in the metabolic environment of STm{Delta}aroA-treated tumors, suggesting STm{Delta}aroA imposes metabolic competition on the tumor. Use of tumor organoid cultures in vitro demonstrated that STm{Delta}aroA can directly affect the tumor epithelium with alterations in transcripts and metabolites similar to in vivo-treated tumors. Thereby, we demonstrate that bacterial cancer therapy is efficacious in autochthonous intestinal cancer models, that BCT imposes metabolic competition, and that BCT has direct effects on the tumor epithelium, which have not previously been appreciated.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryAttenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium can home to gastrointestinal tumors and directly affect the tumor epithelium, inducing transcriptional and metabolic changes that lead to reduced tumor burden in mice.",

    "abstract": "Neural mechanisms of ongoing nociceptive processing in the human brain remain largely obscured by the dual challenge of accessing neural dynamics and safely applying sustained painful stimuli. Recently, pain-related neural processing has been measured using fMRI resting state functional connectivity (FC) in chronic pain patients. However, ongoing pain-related processing in normally pain-free humans remains incompletely understood. Therefore, differences between chronic pain patients and controls may be due to comorbidities with chronic pain. Decreased FC among regions of the descending pain modulation network (DPMN) are associated with presence and severity of chronic pain disorders. We aimed to determine if the presence of prolonged tonic pain would lead to disruption of the DPMN. High (10%) concentration topical capsaicin was combined with a warm thermode applied to the leg to create a flexible, prolonged tonic pain model to study the FC of brain networks in otherwise healthy, pain-free subjects in two separate cohorts (n=18; n=32). We contrasted seed-based FC during prolonged tonic pain with a pain-free passive task. In seed-based FC analysis prolonged tonic pain led to enhanced FC between the anterior middle cingulate cortex (aMCC) and the somatosensory leg representation. Additionally, FC was enhanced between the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC), right mediodorsal thalamus and the posterior parietal cortex bilaterally. Further, in the seed-driven PAG network, positive FC with the left DLPFC became negative FC during prolonged tonic pain. These data suggest that some altered DPMN FC findings in chronic pain could partially be explained by the presence of ongoing pain.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPTSD and depression commonly co-occur and have been associated with smaller hippocampal volumes compared to healthy and trauma-exposed controls. However, the hippocampus is heterogeneous, with subregions that may be uniquely affected in individuals with PTSD and depression.\\n\\nMethodsWe used random effects regressions and a harmonized neuroimaging protocol based on FreeSurfer (v6.0) to identify sub-structural hippocampal markers of current PTSD (C-PTSD), depression, and the interaction of these conditions across 31 cohorts worldwide (N=3,115; Mage=38.9{+/-}13.9 years). Secondary analyses tested these associations by sex and after modeling the simultaneous effects of remitted PTSD, childhood trauma, mild traumatic brain injury, and alcohol use disorder.\\n\\nResultsA significant negative main effect of depression (n=800, vs. no depression, n=1456) was observed in the hippocampal tail ({beta}=-0.13) and CA1 ({beta}=-0.09) after adjusting for covariates and multiple testing (adjusted ps (q)=0.028). A main effect of C-PTSD (n=1042 vs. control, n=1359) was not significant, but an interaction between C-PTSD and depression was significant in the CA1 ({beta}=-0.24, q=0.044). Pairwise comparisons revealed significantly smaller CA1 volumes in individuals with C-PTSD+Depression than controls ({beta}=-0.12, q=0.012), C-PTSD-only ({beta}=-0.17, q=0.001), and Depression-only ({beta}=-0.18, q=0.023). Follow-up analyses revealed sex effects in the hippocampal tail of depressed females, and an interaction effect of C-PTSD and depression in the fimbria of males.\\n\\nConclusionsCollectively our results suggest that depression is a stronger predictor of hippocampal volumetry than PTSD, particularly in the CA1, and provide compelling evidence of more pronounced hippocampal phenotypes in comorbid PTSD and depression compared to either condition alone.",

To understand the genetic basis of early social behaviour, we studied the different responses to familiar/unfamiliar individuals and social reinstatement in 4-day-old domestic chicks (Gallus gallus) in three genetically isolated breeds: Padovana, Polverara and Robusta. All breeds showed a similar ability to discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar individuals, staying closer to familiar individuals. Social reinstatement motivation measured as the average distance between subjects, latency to the first step and exploration of the arena (a proxy for the lack of fear), differed between breeds. More socially motivated chicks that stayed in closer proximity, were also less fearful and explored the environment more extensively. These results suggest that modulation of social behaviour shows larger genetic variability than the ability to recognise social partners, which appears to be an adaptive ability widespread at the species level even for very young animals.",

    "abstract": "Gram positive bacteria colonize mucosal tissues against large mechanical perturbations, such as coughing, which generate large shear forces that exceed the ability of non-covalent bonds to remain attached. To overcome these challenges, the pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes utilizes the protein Cpa, a pilus tip-end adhesin equipped with a Cys-Gln thioester bond. The reactivity of this bond towards host surface ligands enables covalent anchoring of the bacterium, allowing it to resist large mechanical shocks; however, colonization also requires cell migration and spreading over surfaces. The molecular mechanisms underlying these seemingly incompatible requirements remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate a magnetic tweezers force spectroscopy assay that resolves the dynamics of Cpa thioester bond under force. While folded at forces < 6 pN, Cpa thioester bond reacts reversibly with amine ligands, of common occurrence in inflammation sites; however, mechanical unfolding and exposure to forces higher than 35 pN blocks thioester reactivity entirely. We propose that this folding-coupled thioester reactivity switch allows the adhesin to hop and sample host surface ligands at low force (nomadic mobility phase), and yet gets covalently anchored in place while under mechanical stress (locked phase). We dub such bonds \\\"smart covalent bonds\\\", adding a novel class to the known repertoire of non-covalent adhesion strategies that include slip bonds, and catch bonds.",

    "abstract": "Populations whose mating pairs have levels of similarity in phenotypes or genotypes that differ systematically from the level expected under random mating are described as experiencing assortative mating. Excess similarity in mating pairs is termed positive assortative mating, and excess dissimilarity is negative assortative mating. In humans, empirical studies suggest that mating pairs from various admixed populations--whose ancestry derives from two or more source populations--possess correlated ancestry components that indicate the occurrence of positive assortative mating on the basis of ancestry. Generalizing a two-sex mechanistic admixture model, we devise a model of one form of ancestry-assortative mating that occurs through preferential mating based on source population. Under the model, we study the moments of the admixture fraction distribution for different assumptions about mating preferences, including both positive and negative assortative mating by population. We consider the special cases of assortative mating by population that involve a single admixture event and that consider a model of constant contributions to the admixed population over time. We demonstrate that whereas the mean admixture under assortative mating is equivalent to that of a corresponding randomly mating population, the variance of admixture depends on the level and direction of assortative mating. In contrast to standard settings in which positive assortment increases variation within a population, certain assortative mating scenarios allow the variance of admixture to decrease relative to a corresponding randomly mating population: with the three populations we consider, the variance-increasing effect of positive assortative mating within a population might be overwhelmed by a variance-decreasing effect emerging from mating preferences involving other pairs of populations. The effect of assortative mating is smaller on the X chromosome than the autosomes because inheritance of the X in males depends only on the mothers ancestry, not on the mating pair. Because the variance of admixture is informative about the timing of admixture and possibly about sex-biased admixture contributions, the effects of assortative mating are important to consider in inferring features of population history from distributions of admixture values. Our model provides a framework to quantitatively study assortative mating under flexible scenarios of admixture over time.",

    "abstract": "Paclitaxel is a chemotherapeutic agent that causes peripheral neuropathy (PIPN) as a side effect of cancer treatment. Severely affected patients need to terminate chemotherapy, diminishing their chance of survival. The underlying causes of PIPN are unclear, but epidermal, unmyelinated axons have been shown to be the first to degenerate. We previously utilized a zebrafish in vivo model to show that the epidermal matrix-metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13) induces degeneration of unmyelinated axons, whereas pharmacological inhibition of MMP-13 prevented axon degeneration. The precise functions by which MMP-13 is regulated and affects axons, however, remained elusive. In this study, we assessed mitochondrial damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation as possible inducers of MMP-13, and we analyzed MMP-13-dependent damage. We show that the small ROS, H2O2, is increased in keratinocytes following treatment with paclitaxel. Epidermal mitochondrial damage appears to be a source of ROS leading to cytoplasmic H2O2 elevation, upregulation of MMP-13, and increased matrix degradation. Intriguingly, although axonal mitochondria also show aberrant morphologies and are vacuolized, as shown in other neuropathies, these axonal mitochondria do not produce increased H2O2 levels. We suggest that mitochondrial vacuolization occurs independently of axonal damage given that MMP-13 inhibition prevents axon degeneration, though vacuoles persist. We further show that MMP-13 dysregulation also underlies PIPN in rodent paclitaxel models, and that this function appears to be DRG neuron-extrinsic. These findings suggest that vacuolization is not a cause of paclitaxel-induced neuropathy, and that epidermal MMP-13 is a strong candidate for therapeutic interventions in cancer patients with neuropathy.",

    "abstract": "Many studies show that keeping cats and dogs has a positive impact on humans physical and mental health and quality of life. The existence of this \\\"pet phenomenon\\\" is now widely discussed because other studies performed recently have demonstrated a negative impact of owning pets or no impact at all. The main problem of many studies was the autoselection - participants were informed about the aims of the study during recruitment and later likely described their health and wellbeing according to their personal beliefs and wishes, not according to their real status. To avoid this source of bias, we did not mention pets during participant recruitment and hid the pet-related questions among many hundreds of questions in an 80-minute Internet questionnaire. Results of our study performed on a sample of on 10,858 subjects showed that liking cats and dogs has a weak positive association with quality of life. However, keeping pets, especially cats, and even more being injured by pets, were strongly negatively associated with many facets of quality of life. Our data also confirmed that infection by the cat parasite Toxoplasma had a very strong negative effect on quality of life, especially on mental health. However, the infection was not responsible for the observed negative effects of keeping pets, as these effects were much stronger in 1,527 Toxoplasma-free subjects than in the whole population. Any cross-sectional study cannot discriminate between a cause and an effect. However, because of the large and still growing popularity of keeping pets, the existence and nature of the reverse pet phenomenon deserve the outmost attention.",

    "abstract": "An important step in metagenomics studies is to identify which species are present in a sample as well as to compare samples from different environments. Here we introduce MicroWineBar, a graphical tool for analyzing and comparing metagenomics samples. MicroWineBar can visualize the abundances of metagenomics samples in line and bar graphs, as well as analyse the richness and diversity. For a PCA as well as a differential abundance analysis, the abundance data is treated as compositional data and center log-ratio transformed. We use MicroWineBar to analyse two different years of wine fermentation as well as data from a human microbiome study of colorectal cancer. Importantly, MicroWineBar does not require any programming skills, is intuitive and user friendly. MicroWineBar is available at https://github.com/klincke/MicroWineBar and as a python package from the Python Package Index.",

    "abstract": "For rodents, olfaction is essential for locating food, recognizing mates and competitors, avoiding predators, and navigating their environment. It is thought that rodents may have expanded olfactory receptor repertoires in order to specialize in olfactory behavior. Despite being the largest clade of mammals and depending on olfaction relatively little work has documented olfactory repertoires outside of the conventional laboratory mice and rats. Here we report the olfactory receptor repertoire of the African giant pouched rat (Cricetomys ansorgei), a Muroid rodent distantly related to mice and rats. The African giant pouched rat is notable for its large cortex and olfactory bulbs relative to its body size compared to other sympatric rodents, which suggests anatomical elaboration of olfactory capabilities. We hypothesized that in addition to anatomical elaboration for olfaction, these pouched rats might also have an expanded olfactory receptor repertoire to enable their olfactory behavior. We examined the composition of the olfactory receptor repertoire to better understand how their sensory capabilities have evolved. We identified 1145 functional olfactory genes, and 260 additional pseudogenes within 301 subfamilies from the African giant pouched rat genome. This repertoire is similar to mice and rats in terms of size, pseudogene percentage and number of subfamilies. Analyses of olfactory receptor gene trees revealed that the pouched rat has 6 expansions in different subfamilies compared to mice, rats and squirrels. We identified 99 orthologous genes conserved among 4 rodent species and an additional 167 conserved genes within the Muroid rodents. The orthologous genes shared within Muroidea suggests that there may be a conserved Muroid-specific olfactory receptor repertoire. We also note that the description of this repertoire can serve as a complement to other studies of rodent olfaction, as the pouched rat is an outgroup within Muroidea. Thus, our data suggest that African giant pouched rats are capable of both natural and trained olfactory behaviors with a typical Muriod olfactory receptor repertoire.",

However, while platelets are known participate in immune responses and play significant roles during infections, the role of MKs within the immune system has not been explored. Here we utilize in vitro techniques to show that both cord blood-derived MKs (CB MKs) and MKs from a human megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line (Meg-01) chemotax towards pathogenic stimuli, phagocytose bacteria, and release chromatin webs in response to bacteria. Moreover, in patients with sepsis, we found that MK counts were significantly higher in the peripheral blood, and CD61+ staining was increased in the kidneys and lungs, correlated with the development of organ dysfunction. Overall, our study suggests that MK cells display basic innate immune cell functions and respond during infections and sepsis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundStudents go through a transition when they enter university, which involves major individual and contextual changes in every domain of life that may lead to several behavioral and health problems. This paper describes a wide range of health behaviors among male and female university students in Cambodia.\\n\\nMethodsA cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2015 among students randomly selected from the Royal University of Phnom Penh and University of Battambang. Health-related behaviors in different domains were collected using a structured questionnaire. Chi-square test, Fishers exact test, or independent Students t-test was used as appropriate to describe and compare the variables among male and female students.\\n\\nResultsThis study included 1359 students, of whom 50.8% were male, and the mean age was 21.3 years (SD= 2.3). Of the total, 79.5% reported not having any vigorous-intensity activities, 25.9% not having moderate-intensity activities, and 33.5% not having walked continuously for 10 minutes during the past seven days. The prevalence of substance use was low with 38.3% currently drinking alcohol, 1.1% smoking tobacco, and 0.4% using an illicit drug during the past 12 months. About one in ten (10.6%) reported having sexual intercourse, with a mean number of partners of 2.1 (SD= 2.4) during the past 12 months, and 42.4% not using a condom in the last intercourse. Only 7.1% reported having been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection in the past 12 months; of whom, 60% sought for treatment. About one-third (33.6%) reported eating fast food once or twice, and 5.3% having it three times or more over the last week. More than half (55.6%) had one to two servings of fruits and vegetables daily, and 9.9% did not eat any fruits and vegetables over the last week.\\n\\nConclusionsWe found that the prevalence of sexual risk behaviors and substance use was plausibly low among university students in this study. However, the rates of inactive lifestyle and unhealthy food consumption were concerning. Public policy and universities should promote healthy behaviors among the students. The interventions may take advantage of and expend upon the good health behaviors and consider gender differences.",

    "abstract": "To regenerate tissue engineered cartilage as a source for the restoration of cartilage defects, we used a human fetal cartilage progenitor cell (hFCPC) pellet for improve the chondrogenesis and modulation the immune response with a In vivo (IV) bioreactor system, that was buried subcutaneously in the host and then implanted into a cartilage defect. In vivo bioreactor (IVB) was composed of silicone tube and cellulose nanopore-size membrane. FCPC pellets were first cultured in vitro for 3 days, and then cultured in vitro, subcutaneous and IV bioreactor for 3 weeks. First evaluated the IV bioreactor fluid appearance, component and liquidity, and then evaluate chondrogenesis and immunogenicity of the pellets using gross observation, cell viability, histology, biochemical analysis, RT-PCR, and Western Blot, finally evaluates the cartilage repair and synovial inflammation using histology. The fluid color and transparency of IV bioreactor were similar to synovial fluid (SF) and the component was also close to SF compared to the serum. IV bioreactor system not only promotes the synthesis of cartilage matrix and maintains cartilage phenotype, but also delays the occurrence of calcification compared with subcutaneous. A IV bioreactor, which has been predominantly adopted to study cell differentiation, was effective in preventing host immune rejection.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundStudies have suggested associations between self-reported engagement in health behaviors and reduced risk of cognitive decline. Most studies explore these relationships using one health behavior, often cross-sectionally or with dementia as the outcome. In this study, we explored whether several individual self-reported health behaviors were associated with cognitive decline when considered simultaneously, using data from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimers Prevention (WRAP), an Alzheimers disease risk-enriched cohort who were non-demented and in late midlife at baseline.\\n\\nMethodWe analyzed longitudinal cognitive data from 828 participants in WRAP, with a mean age at baseline cognitive assessment of 57 (range = 36-78, sd = 6.8) and an average of 6.3 years (standard deviation = 1.9, range = 2-10) of follow-up. The primary outcome was a multi-domain cognitive composite, and secondary outcomes were immediate/delayed memory and executive function composites. Predictors of interest were self-reported measures of physical activity, cognitive activity, adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet (MIND), and interactions with each other and age. We conducted linear mixed effects analyses within an Information-theoretic (IT) model averaging (MA) approach on a set of models including covariates and combinations of these 2- and 3-way interactions. The IT approach was selected due to the large number of interactions of interest and to avoid pitfalls of traditional model selection approaches.\\n\\nResultsModel-averaged results identified no significant modifiable behavior*age interactions in relationship to the primary composite outcome. In secondary outcomes, higher MIND diet scores associated with slower decline in executive function. Men showed faster decline than women on delayed memory, independent of health behaviors. There were no other significant interactions among any other health behaviors and cognitive trajectories.\\n\\nConclusionsWhen multiple covariates and health behaviors were considered simultaneously, there were limited weak associations with cognitive decline in this age range. These results may be explained alone or in combination by three alternative explanations: 1) the range of cognitive decline is in middle age is too small to observe relationships with health behaviors, 2) the putative associations of these health behaviors on cognition may not be robust in this age range, or 3) the self-reported measures of the health behaviors may not be optimal for predicting cognitive decline. More study may be needed that incorporates sensitive measures of health behaviors, AD biomarker profiles, and/or other disease comorbidities.",
