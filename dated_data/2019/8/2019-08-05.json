    "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) genome sequencing is routinely done for drug resistance monitoring in hospitals worldwide. Subtyping these extensive datasets of HIV-1 sequences is a critical first step in molecular epidemiology and surveillance studies. The clinical relevance of HIV-1 subtypes is increasingly recognized. Several studies suggest subtype-related differences in disease progression, transmission route efficiency, immune evasion, and even therapeutic outcomes. HIV-1 subtyping is mainly done using web servers. These tools have limitations in scalability and potential noncompliance with data protection legislation. Thus, the aim of this work was to develop an efficient method for local and high-throughput HIV-1 subtyping. We designed SNAPPy: a snakemake pipeline for scalable HIV-1 subtyping by phylogenetic pairing. It contains several tasks of phylogenetic inference and BLAST queries, which can be executed sequentially or in parallel, taking advantage of multiple-core processing units. Although it was built for subtyping, SNAPPy is also useful to perform extensive HIV-1 alignments. This tool facilitates large-scale sequence-based HIV-1 research by providing a local, resource efficient and scalable alternative for HIV-1 subtyping. It is capable of analysing full-length genomes or partial HIV-1 genomic regions (GAG, POL, ENV) and recognizes more than 90 circulating recombinant forms.

    "abstract": "BackgroundHeat shock A1B, also known as HSP70kDa protein 1B, encodes a 70kDa heat shock protein which is a member of the heat shock protein 70 family. HspA1B is a critical gene which related to many type of diseases by involving in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. However, the correlations of HspA1B to prognosis and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in different cancers remain unclear.\\n\\nMethodsHspA1B expression was evaluated on the Oncomine database and Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) site. We analyzed the influence of HspA1B on clinical prognosis using Kaplan-Meier plotter, the PrognoScan database and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA). The correlations between HspA1B and cancer immune infiltrates was investigated via TIMER. In addition, correlations between HspA1B expression and gene marker sets of immune infiltrates were analyzed by TIMER and GEPIA.\\n\\nResultsThree cohorts (GSE9195, GSE9893, GSE3494-GPL96)) of breast cancer patients showed that high HspA1B expression was associated with poorer overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and disease-free survival (DFS). In addition, high HspA1B expression was significantly correlated with poor OS and progression-free survival (PFS) in bladder cancer, brain cancer and skin cancer. Moreover, HspA1B significantly impacts the prognosis of diverse cancers via The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). HspA1B expression was positively correlated with infiltrating levels of CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells (DCs) indifferent subtypes of Breast cancer. HspA1B expression showed strong correlations with diverse immune marker sets in BRCA-Luminal.\\n\\nConclusionsOur findings suggest that HspA1B is correlated with prognosis and immune infiltrating levels of, including those of CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and DCs in multiple cancers, especially in colon and gastric cancer patients. In addition, HspA1B expression potentially contributes to regulation of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), DCs, T cell exhaustion and Tregs in colon and gastric cancer. These findings suggest that HspA1B can be used as a prognostic biomarker for determining prognosis and immune infiltration in BRCA-Luminal subtype.",

    "abstract": "Recently, dysregulated circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been associated with the progression of numerous malignant tumors. However, the mechanism through which circRNAs participate in breast cancer (BC) remains unclear. This study was designed to illustrate the role of hsa_circ_0068033 in BC. A series of functional experiments were conducted to assess the function of hsa_circ_0068033 in the development of BC and the underlying mechanisms. The results suggested that the expression of hsa_circ_0068033 was downregulated in BC tissues, and markedly correlated with tumor size (P=0.021) and the Tumor, Node, and Metastasis stage (P=0.023). Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that hsa_circ_0068033 testing yielded an area under the curve value of 0.8480 in discriminating BC from non-tumor controls. Functionally, overexpression of hsa_circ_0068033 could inhibit the growth, clone formation, invasion, and migration of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, while activating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway to induce apoptosis. The xenograft experiment revealed that exogenous hsa_circ_0068033 is able to reduce the tumorigenic ability of MDA-MB-231 cells in nude mice. Rescue assays further proved that hsa_circ_0068033 exerts biological functions by sponging miR-659. This study revealed for the first time that hsa_circ_0068033 acts as a tumor suppressor gene in BC, and the hsa_circ_0068033/miR-659 axis participates in the progression of BC.",

    "abstract": "Establishment of the ocular anterior segment (AS) is a critical event during development of the vertebrate visual system. Failure in this process leads to Anterior Segment Dysgenesis (ASD), which is characterized by congenital blindness and predisposition to glaucoma. The anterior segment is largely formed via a neural crest-derived population, the Periocular Mesenchyme (POM). In this study, we aimed to characterize POM behaviors and identities during zebrafish AS development. POM distributions and migratory dynamics were analyzed using transgenic zebrafish embryos (Tg[foxC1b:GFP], Tg[foxD3:GFP], Tg[pitx2:GFP], Tg[lmx1b.1:GFP], and Tg[sox10:GFP] throughout the course of early AS development (24-72hpf). In vivo imaging analysis revealed unique AS distribution and migratory behavior among the reporter lines, suggesting AS mesenchyme (ASM) is a heterogenous population. This was confirmed using double in situ hybridization. Furthermore, we generated ASM transcriptomic profiles from our reporter lines and using a four-way comparison analysis uncovered unique ASM subpopulation expression patterns. Taken together, our data reveal for the first time that AS-associated POM is not homogeneous but rather comprised of several unique subpopulations identifiable by their distributions, behaviors, and transcriptomic profiles.",

    "abstract": "Population dynamics of marine species that are sessile as adults are driven by oceanographic dispersal of larvae from spawning to nursery grounds. This is mediated by life-history traits such as the timing and frequency of spawning, larval behaviour and duration, and settlement success. Here, we use 1725 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to study the fine scale spatial genetic structure in the commercially important cockle species Cerastoderma edule and compare it to environmental variables and current-mediated larval dispersal within a modelling framework. Hydrodynamic modelling employing the NEMO Atlantic Margin Model (AMM15) was used to simulate larval transport and estimate connectivity between populations during spawning months (April - September), factoring in larval duration and seasonal variability of ocean currents. Results at neutral loci reveal the existence of three separate genetic clusters (mean FST=0.021) within a relatively fine spatial scale in the northwest Atlantic. Environmental association (EA) analysis indicates that oceanographic currents and geographical distance between the populations explain over 20% of the variance observed at neutral loci, while genetic variance (71%) at outlier loci was explained by sea surface temperatures extremes. These results fill an important knowledge gap in the management of a commercially important, overexploited species, and bring us closer to understanding the role of larval dispersal in connecting populations at a fine geographical scale.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous germline mutations are the raw material on which evolution acts, and knowledge of their frequency and genomic distribution is crucial for understanding how evolution operates at both long and short timescales. At present, the rate and spectrum of de novo mutations have been directly characterized in only a few lineages. It is therefore critical to expand the phylogenetic scope of these studies to gain a more general understanding of observed mutation rate patterns. Our study provides the first direct mutation rate estimate for a strepsirrhine (i.e., the lemurs and lorises), which comprise nearly half of the primate clade. Using high-coverage linked-read sequencing for a focal quartet of gray mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus), we estimated the mutation rate to be 1.64 x 10-8 (95% credible interval: 1.41 x 10-8 to 1.98 x 10-8) mutations/site/generation. This estimate is higher than those measured for most previously characterized mammals. Further, we found an unexpectedly low count of paternal mutations, and only a modest overrepresentation of mutations at CpG-sites. Given the surprising nature of these observations, we conducted an independent analysis of context-dependent substitution types for gray mouse lemur and five additional primate species. This analysis yielded patterns consistent with the mutation spectrum from the pedigree mutation-rate analysis, which provides confidence in our ability to accurately identify de novo mutations with our data and bioinformatic filters.",

When applied for major psychiatric disorders and autoimmune diseases, neural and immune features, respectively, exhibited high explanatory power while reflecting the pathophysiology of the relevant disease. The predicted causal variants were concentrated in active regulatory regions of relevant cell types and tended to be in physical contact with transcription factors while residing in evolutionarily conserved regions and resulting in expression changes of genes related to the given disease. We demonstrate some examples of novel candidate causal variants and associated genes. Our method is expected to contribute to the identification and functional interpretation of causal noncoding variants in post-GWAS analyses.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOver the past three decades, Nile tilapia industry has grown into a significant aquaculture industry spread over 120 tropical and sub-tropical countries around the world accounting for 7.4% of global aquaculture production in 2015. Across species, genomic selection has been shown to increase predictive ability and genetic gain, also extending into aquaculture. Hence, the aim of this paper is to compare the predictive abilities of pedigree- and genomic-based models in univariate and multivariate approaches, with the aim to utilize genomic selection in a Nile tilapia breeding program. A total of 1444 fish were genotyped (48,960 SNP loci) and phenotyped for body weight at harvest (BW), fillet weight (FW) and fillet yield (FY). The pedigree-based analysis utilized a deep pedigree, including 14 generations. Estimated breeding values (EBVs and GEBVs) were obtained with traditional pedigree-based (PBLUP) and genomic (GBLUP) models, using both univariate and multivariate approaches. Prediction accuracy and bias were evaluated using 5 replicates of 10-fold cross-validation with three different cross-validation approaches. Further, impact of these models and approaches on the genetic evaluation was assessed based on the ranking of the selection candidates.\\n\\nResultsGBLUP univariate models were found to increase the prediction accuracy and reduce bias of prediction compared to other PBLUP and multivariate approaches. Relative to pedigree-based models, prediction accuracy increased by [~]20% for FY, >75% for FW and >43% for BW. GBLUP models caused major re-ranking of the selection candidates, with no significant difference in the ranking due to univariate or multivariate GBLUP approaches. The heritabilities using multivariate GBLUP models for BW, FW and FY were 0.19 {+/-} 0.04, 0.17 {+/-} 0.04 and 0.23 {+/-} 0.04 respectively. BW showed very high genetic correlation with FW (0.96 {+/-} 0.01) and a slightly negative genetic correlation with FY (-0.11 {+/-} 0.15).\\n\\nConclusionPredictive ability of genomic prediction models is substantially higher than for classical pedigree-based models. Genomic selection is therefore beneficial to the Nile tilapia breeding program, and it is recommended in routine genetic evaluations of commercial traits in the Nile tilapia breeding nucleus.",

ILC3 and neuronal cells were shown to interact at discrete mucosal locations to steer mucosal defence2,3. Nevertheless, whether neuroimmune circuits operate at an organismal level, integrating extrinsic environmental signals to orchestrate ILC3 responses remains elusive. Here we show that light-entrained and brain-tuned circadian circuits regulate enteric ILC3, intestinal homeostasis, gut defence and the host lipid metabolism. We found that enteric ILC3 display circadian expression of clock genes and ILC3-related transcription factors. ILC3-autonomous ablation of the circadian regulator Arntl led to disrupted gut ILC3 homeostasis, impaired epithelial reactivity, deregulated microbiome, increased susceptibility to bowel infection and disrupted lipid metabolism. Loss of ILC3-intrinsic Arntl shaped the gut postcode receptors of ILC3. Strikingly, light-dark cycles, feeding rhythms and microbial cues differentially regulated ILC3 clocks, with light signals as major entraining cues of ILC3. Accordingly, surgical- and genetically-induced deregulation of brain rhythmicity led to disrupted circadian ILC3 oscillations, deregulated microbiome and altered lipid metabolism. Our work reveals a circadian circuitry that translates environmental light cues into enteric ILC3, shaping intestinal health, metabolism and organismal homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Functional constraints on viral proteins are often assessed by examining sequence conservation among natural strains, but this approach is relatively ineffective for Zika virus because all known sequences are highly similar. Here we take an alternative approach to map functional constraints on Zika viruss envelope (E) protein by using deep mutational scanning to measure how all amino-acid mutations to the protein affect viral growth in cell culture. The resulting sequence-function map is consistent with existing knowledge about E protein structure and function, but also provides insight into mutation-level constraints in many regions of the protein that have not been well characterized in prior functional work. In addition, we extend our approach to completely map how mutations affect viral neutralization by two monoclonal antibodies, thereby precisely defining their functional epitopes. Overall, our study provides a valuable resource for understanding the effects of mutations to this important viral protein, and also offers a roadmap for future work to map functional and antigenic selection to Zika virus at high resolution.\\n\\nImportanceZika virus has recently been shown to be associated with severe birth defects. The viruss E protein mediates its ability to infect cells, and is also the primary target of the antibodies that are elicited by natural infection and vaccines that are being developed against the virus. Therefore, determining the effects of mutations to this protein is important for understanding its function, its susceptibility to vaccine-mediated immunity, and its potential for future evolution. We completely mapped how amino-acid mutations to E protein affected the viruss ability to grow in cells in the lab and escape from several antibodies. The resulting maps relate changes in the E proteins sequence to changes in viral function, and therefore provide a valuable complement to existing maps of the physical structure of the protein.",

While aromatase inhibitors role on mPTP has been previously studied, the role of anastrazole on mPTP is not completely elucidated.\\n\\nMethodsThe role of anastrozole in modulating the mPTP was evaluated by docking and molecular dynamics using human cyclophillin D data. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs] of patients with mitochondrial disorders and healthy controls were treated with anastrazole and evaluated for mean fluorescence by flow cytometer. Spectrophotometry was employed for total ATP level estimation.\\n\\nFindingsAnastrozole - cyclophillin D complex is more stable when compared to cyclosporine A - cyclophillin D. Anastrozole performed better than cyclosporine in inhibiting mPTP pore. Additional effects included reduction in mitochondrial swelling and mitochondrial membrane depolarization, decreased super oxide generations, caspase 3 intrinsic activity and cellular apoptosis levels and increase in ATP levels.\\n\\nInterpretationThese results highlights the potency of anastrozole as a promising agent in ameliorating the phenotype by inhibiting the opening of mPTP pore. However, larger functional studies are required to validate the efficacy of this molecule as a therapeutic agent in mitochondrial disorders.",

    "abstract": "Using fMRI as a clinical tool, for example for lateralizing language, requires that it provides accurate results on the individual level. However, using a single voxel-wise activity map per patient limits how well the uncertainty associated with a decision can be estimated. Here, we explored how using a \"volume-wise\" analysis, where the lateralization of each time point of a patients fMRI session is evaluated independently, could support clinical decision making. Ninety-six patients with epilepsy who performed a language fMRI were analyzed retrospectively. Results from Wada testing were used as an indication of true language lateralization. Each patients 200 fMRI volumes were correlated with an independent template of prototypical lateralization. Depending on the strength of correlation with the template, each volume was classified as indicating either left-lateralized, bilateral or right-lateralized language. A decision about the patients language lateralization was then made based on how most volumes were classified. The results show that, using a simple majority vote, accuracies of 84% were reached in a sample of 63 patients with high-quality data. When 33 patients with datasets previously deemed inconclusive were added, the same accuracy was reached when more than 43% of a patients volumes were in agreement with each other. Increasing this cutoff to 51% volumes with agreeing classifications allowed for excluding all inconclusive cases and reaching accuracies over 90% for the remaining cases. Further increasing the cutoff to 65% agreeing volumes resulted in correct predictions for all remaining patients. The study confirms the usefulness of fMRI for language lateralization in patients with epilepsy, by demonstrating high accuracies. Furthermore, it illustrates how the diagnostic yield of individual volumes of fMRI data can be increased using simple similarity measures. The accuracy of our approach increased with the number of agreeing volumes, and thus allowed estimating the uncertainty associated with each individual diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are characterized by a range of aberrations in the processing of and response to threat, but there is little clarity what core pathogenesis might underlie these symptoms. Here we propose that a particular set of unrealistically pessimistic assumptions can distort an agents behavior and underlie a host of seemingly disparate anxiety symptoms. We formalize this hypothesis in a decision theoretic analysis of maladaptive avoidance and a reinforcement learning model, which shows how a localized bias in beliefs can formally explain a range of phenomena related to anxiety. The core observation, implicit in standard decision theoretic accounts of sequential evaluation, is that the potential for avoidance should be protective: if danger can be avoided later, it poses less threat now. We show how a violation of this assumption -- via a pessimistic, false belief that later avoidance will be unsuccessful -- leads to a characteristic, excessive propagation of fear and avoidance to situations far antecedent of threat. This single deviation can explain a range of features of anxious behavior, including exaggerated threat appraisals, fear generalization, and persistent avoidance. Simulations of the model reproduce laboratory demonstrations of abnormal decision making in anxiety, including in situations of approach-avoid conflict and planning to avoid losses. The model also ties together a number of other seemingly disjoint phenomena in anxious disorders. For instance, learning under the pessimistic bias captures a hypothesis about the role of anxiety in the later development of depression. The bias itself offers a new formalization of classic insights from the psychiatric literature about the central role of maladaptive beliefs about control and self-efficacy in anxiety. This perspective also extends previous computational accounts of beliefs about control in mood disorders, which neglected the sequential aspects of choice.",

    "abstract": "Platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) increases the survival of patients with organ-confined urothelial bladder cancer (UBC). Because not all patients benefit from treatment, NAC has not been widely applied in the clinical setting. There is strong evidence, based on retrospective studies, that patients with Basal/Squamous (BASQ)-like tumours present with more advanced disease and have worse prognosis; global transcriptomics can identify tumour subtypes associated with response to NAC. We aimed to investigate whether tumour immunohistochemical (IHC) subtyping predicts NAC response. Patients with muscle-invasive UBC having received platinum-based NAC were identified in two hospitals in Spain. Tissue microarrays were constructed; RNA and DNA were extracted from full sections. Nanostring analysis and immunohistochemistry to identify BASQ-like tumours and mutational analysis of UBC oncogenes. We used hierarchical clustering to classify 126 tumours and adjusted logistic regression to assess association with treatment response. Outcomes were progression-free survival and disease-specific survival; univariable and multivariate Cox regression models were applied. We found very high concordance between mRNA and protein for the 4 markers analyzed. We identified three main subgroups: BASQ-like (FOXA1/GATA3 low; KRT5/6/14 high), Luminal-like (FOXA1/GATA3 high; KRT5/6/14 low), and mixed-cluster (FOXA1/GATA3 high; KRT5/6 high; KRT14 low). Patients with BASQ-like tumours were more likely to achieve a pathological response to NAC, displaying a disease-specific survival similar to that of the remaining patients. In conclusion, patients with BASQ-like tumours - identified through simple and robust immunohistochemistry - have a higher likelihood of undergoing a pathological complete response to NAC. Prospective validation in independent series is required.\\n\\nNovelty and impactNeoadjuvant chemotherapy is an important component of the management of patietns with muscle-invasive bladder cancer but improved stratification is necessary. This retrospective study shows that patients with BASQ-like tumors can be identified using immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded tissue and are 4-fold more likely to achieve a pathological complete response to platinum-based NAC. The disease-specific survival of patients with BASQ-like tumours treated with NAC was not different from that of other tumour subtypes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAssigning every human gene to specific functions, diseases, and traits is a grand challenge in modern genetics. Key to addressing this challenge are computational methods such as supervised-learning and label-propagation that can leverage molecular interaction networks to predict gene attributes. In spite of being a popular machine learning technique across fields, supervised-learning has been applied only in a few network-based studies for predicting pathway-, phenotype-, or disease-associated genes. It is unknown how supervised-learning broadly performs across different networks and diverse gene classification tasks, and how it compares to label-propagation, the widely-benchmarked canonical approach for this problem.\\n\\nResultsIn this study, we present a comprehensive benchmarking of supervised-learning for network-based gene classification, evaluating this approach and a state-of-the-art label-propagation technique on hundreds of diverse prediction tasks and multiple networks using stringent evaluation schemes. We demonstrate that supervised-learning on a genes full network connectivity outperforms label-propagation and achieves high prediction accuracy by efficiently capturing local network properties, rivaling label-propagations appeal for naturally using network topology. We further show that supervised-learning on the full network is also superior to learning on node-embeddings (derived using node2vec), an increasingly popular approach for concisely representing network connectivity.\\n\\nConclusionThese results show that supervised-learning is an accurate approach for prioritizing genes associated with diverse functions, diseases, and traits and should be considered a staple of network-based gene classification workflows. The datasets and the code used to reproduce the results and add new gene classification methods have been made freely available.\\n\\nContactarjun@msu.edu",

    "abstract": "Biological filaments driven by molecular motors tend to experience tangential propulsive forces also known as active follower forces. When such a filament encounters an obstacle, it deforms, which reorients its follower forces and alters its entire motion. If the filament pushes a cargo, the friction on the cargo can be enough to deform the filament, thus affecting the transport properties of the cargo. Motivated by cytoskeletal filament motility assays, we study the dynamic buckling instabilities of a two-dimensional slender elastic filament driven through a dissipative medium by tangential propulsive forces in the presence of obstacles or cargo. We observe two distinct instabilities. When the filaments head is pinned or experiences significant translational but little rotational drag from its cargo, it buckles into a steadily rotating coiled state. When it is clamped or experiences both significant translational and rotational drag from its cargo, it buckles into a periodically beating, overall translating state. Using minimal analytically tractable models, linear stability theory, and fully non-linear computations, we study the onset of each buckling instability, characterize each buckled state, and map out the phase diagram of the system. Finally, we use particle-based Brownian dynamics simulations to show our main results are robust to moderate noise and steric repulsion. Overall, our results provide a unified framework to understand the dynamics of tangentially propelled filaments and filament-cargo assemblies.",

A mechanistic basis for such a functional divergence of {beta}arr isoforms is still lacking. Using a set of complementary approaches including antibody fragment based conformational sensors, we discover structural differences between {beta}arr1 and 2 upon their interaction with activated and phosphorylated receptors.

A critical requirement imposed on such models is clone consistency: If the individuals from two populations are indistinguishable, joining these populations into one shall not affect the outcome of the model. Otherwise a model produces different outcomes for the same scenario. Using functional analysis, we comprehensively characterize all clone-consistent models: We prove that they are necessarily composed from basic building blocks, namely linear combinations of parameters and abundances. These strong constraints enable a straightforward validation of model consistency or reveal implicit assumptions required to achieve it. We show that such implicit assumptions can considerably limit the applicability of models and the generality of results obtained with them. Moreover, our insights facilitate building new clone-consistent models, which we illustrate for a data-driven model of microbial communities. Finally, our insights point to new relevant forms of general models for theoretical ecology. Our framework thus provides a systematic way of comprehending ecological models, which can guide a wide range of studies.",

However, contrasting changes in trait variances also suggested differences between traits in mediating assembly under oligotrophic versus copiotrophic conditions.

Here, we consider the possibility that peaks can move more rapidly than populations can adapt, resulting in extinction. We model peak movement with explicit population dynamics, parameterized with published microevolutionary parameters. Allowing extinction greatly increases the parameter space of peak movements that yield the appearance of stasis observed in real data through deep time. Our work highlights population ecology as an important contributor to macroevolutionary dynamics, presenting an alternative perspective on the paradox of stasis where apparent constraint on phenotypic evolution in deep time reflects our restricted view of the subset of earths lineages that were fortunate enough to reside on relatively stable peaks.",

    "abstract": "Admixture is increasingly being recognized as an important factor in evolutionary genetics. The distribution of genomic admixture tracts, and the resulting effects on admixture linkage disequilibrium, can be used to date the timing of admixture between species or populations. However, the theory used for such prediction assumes selective neutrality despite the fact that many famous examples of admixture involve natural selection acting for or against admixture. In this paper, we investigate the effects of positive selection on the distribution of tract lengths. We develop a theoretical framework that relies on approximating the trajectory of the selected allele using a logistic function. By numerically calculating the expected allele trajectory, we also show that the approach can be extended to cases where the logistic approximation is poor due to the effects of genetic drift. Using simulations, we show that the model is highly accurate under most scenarios. We use the model to show that positive selection on average will tend to increase the admixture tract length. However, perhaps counter-intuitively, conditional on the allele frequency at the time of sampling, positive selection will actually produce shorter expected tract lengths. We discuss the consequences of our results in interpreting the timing of the introgression of EPAS1 from Denisovans into the ancestors of Tibetans.",

However, in mouse models of colitis, we can investigate at preclinical timepoints. We sought to validate murine Trichuris muris infection as a model for identification of factors that promote development of chronic colitis.\\n\\nMethodsWe compared preclinical changes in mice with a resolving immune response to T. muris (resistant) versus mice that fail to expel the worms and develop chronic colitis (susceptible). Findings were then validated in healthy controls and patients with suspected or confirmed IBD.\\n\\nResultsThe Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products (Rage) was highly dysregulated between resistant and susceptible mice prior to the onset of any pathological signs. Increased soluble RAGE (sRAGE) in the serum and faeces of resistant mice correlated with reduced colitis scores. Mouse model findings were validated in a preliminary clinical study: faecal sRAGE was differentially expressed in patients with active IBD compared with IBD in remission, patients with IBD excluded or healthy controls.\\n\\nConclusionPre-clinical changes in mouse models can identify early pathways in the development of chronic inflammation that human studies cannot. We identified the decoy receptor sRAGE as a potential mechanism for protection against chronic inflammation in colitis in mice and humans. We propose that the RAGE pathway is clinically relevant in the onset of chronic colitis, and that further study of sRAGE in IBD may provide a novel diagnostic and therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance is a global threat for public health. It is widely acknowledged that antibiotics at sub-inhibitory concentrations are important in disseminating antibiotic resistance via horizontal gene transfer. While there is high use of non-antibiotic human-targeted pharmaceuticals in our societies, the potential contribution of these on the spread of antibiotic resistance has been overlooked so far. Here, we report that commonly consumed non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac), a lipid-lowering drug (gemfibrozil), and a {beta}-blocker (propanolol), at clinically and environmentally relevant concentrations, significantly accelerated the conjugation of plasmid-borne antibiotic resistance genes. We looked at the response to these drugs by the bacteria involved in the gene transfer through various analyses that included monitoring reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell membrane permeability by flow cytometry, cell arrangement, and whole-genome RNA and protein sequencing. We found the enhanced conjugation correlated well with increased production of ROS and cell membrane permeability. We also detected closer cell-to-cell contact and upregulated conjugal genes. Additionally, these non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals caused the bacteria to have responses similar to those detected when exposed to antibiotics, such as inducing the SOS response, and enhancing efflux pumps. The findings advance our understanding of the bacterial transfer of antibiotic resistance genes, and importantly emphasize concerns of non-antibiotic human-targeted pharmaceuticals for enhancing the spread of antibiotic resistance.",

Recent advances started to investigate the biodiversity and community composition in these microbial ecosystems but the metabolic activity of the metacommunity has never been investigated to date. In this study, we explored the stress-response, spreading in two different sites of the same location, subjected to increasing environmental pressure due to opposite sun exposure, to verify the effect of sunlight on settlement and adaptation strategies. Results indicated that the metabolic responses are shaped according to external conditions; in the overall 252 altered metabolites (56 and 196 unique for north and south, respectively), distinguished the two differently exposed communities.

    "abstract": "Deep-rooting perennial grasses are promising feedstock for biofuel production, especially in marginal soils lacking organic material, nutrients, and/or that experience significant water stress. Perennial grass roots can alter surrounding soil conditions and influence microbial activities, particularly the production of extracellular polymeric substances composed primarily of extracellular polysaccharides (EPS). These polymers can alleviate cellular moisture and nutrient stress, and enhance soil characteristics through improved water retention and aggregate stability, the latter of which may in turn enhance carbon persistence. In this study we used a 13CO2 tracer greenhouse experiment to examine the effect of switchgrass cultivation on the production and origin of EPS in a marginal soil with five fertilization/water treatments (control, +N, +NP, +P, low water). Soils with both added nitrogen and phosphorus had the highest root biomass, EPS and percentage of water-stable soil aggregates. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed root biomass was the most important determinant for soil EPS production, potentially by controlling carbon supply and diurnal changes in soil water potential. Path analysis highlighted the role of soil water potential were and EPS on with water-stable soil aggregates, indicating that EPS concentration and soil aggregation have similar drivers in this soil. High mannose content confirmed the microbial origin of EPS. 13CO2 labeling indicated that 0.18% of newly fixed plant carbon was incorporated into EPS. Analysis of field samples suggests that EPS is significantly enhanced under long-term switchgrass cultivation. Our results demonstrate that switchgrass cultivation can promote microbial production of EPS, providing a mechanism to enhance sustainability of marginal soils.",

    "abstract": "Fucose is a common component of eukaryotic cell-surface glycoconjugates, generally added by Golgi-resident fucosyltransferases. Whereas fucosylated glycoconjugates are rare in kinetoplastids, the biosynthesis of the nucleotide sugar GDP-Fuc has been shown to be essential in Trypanosoma brucei. Here we show that the single identifiable T. brucei fucosyltransferase (TbFUT1) is a GDP-Fuc: {beta}-D-galactose -1,2-fucosyltransferase with an apparent preference for a Gal{beta}1,3GlcNAc{beta}1-O-R acceptor motif. Conditional null mutants of TbFUT1 demonstrated that it is essential for both the mammalian-infective bloodstream form and the insect vector-dwelling procyclic form. Unexpectedly, TbFUT1 was localized in the mitochondrion of T. brucei and found to be required for mitochondrial function in bloodstream form trypanosomes. Finally, the TbFUT1 gene was able to complement a Leishmania major mutant lacking the homologous fucosyltransferase gene (Guo et al., 2021). Together these results suggest that kinetoplastids possess an unusual, conserved and essential mitochondrial fucosyltransferase activity that may have therapeutic potential across trypanosomatids.",

    "abstract": "Astrocytes play an important role in cardiovascular reflex integration at the level of the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS). Existing reports from brainstem slice preparations suggest that astrocytes here respond to input from the solitary tract by increasing intracellular calcium. However, the physiological significance of this neuron-astrocyte signaling in vivo remains unknown. Here, we report that stimulation of the vagus nerve in an anesthetized rat induced rapid [Ca2+]i increases in astrocytes transduced to express calcium sensor GCaMP6. The receptors involved were determined using brainstem-derived astroglial cell cultures were loaded with [Ca2+] indicator Fura-2. 5-HT (10 {micro}M) caused robust increases in [Ca2+]i, and pharmacological interrogation revealed the expression of functional 5-HT2A receptors. This observation was confirmed in vivo: intravenous administration of ketanserin decreased the magnitude of [Ca2+]i responses, induced by vagal afferent simulation, by [~]50%. However, the response was completely blocked by topical application of the AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX alone. To investigate the role of astrocyte-neuron communication, the vesicular release in the NTS astrocytes was blocked by virally driven expression of a dominant-negative SNARE protein in vivo. This increased baroreflex sensitivity in awake animals, which was also observed in anesthetized animals after topical application of the P2Y1 receptor antagonist MDS-2500 to the NTS. We hypothesize that NTS astrocytes respond to incoming afferent release of glutamate and this response is modulated by 5-HT originating from vagal afferents or other sources. ATP is then released, which acts on inhibitory interneurons via P2Y1 receptors and thus modulates the expression of cardiovascular reflexes.\\n\\nSignificance statementCardiorespiratory nuclei in the brainstem integrate cardiovascular sensory information to optimise tissue perfusion and blood gas concentrations. We describe experimental evidence that NTS astrocytes participate in setting the baroreflex sensitivity by release of ATP acting on P2Y1 receptors on inhibitory interneurons. Activation of astrocytes is partly under control of 5-HT co-released with glutamate from vagal afferents, which allows modulation of autonomic response to high frequency/duration of afferent stimulation by monitoring extra-synaptic 5-HT acting on glial 5-HT2A receptors. This could represent a signaling pathway that is activated under pathological conditions and is responsible for baroreflex impairment in conditions that result in astrogliosis, for example from systemic inflammatory response or chronic hypoxia/hypercapnia.",

    "abstract": "Visuomotor rotations are learned through a combination of explicit strategy and implicit recalibration. However, measuring the relative contribution of each remains a challenge and the possibility of multiple explicit and implicit components complicates the issue. Recent interest has focused on the possibility that eye movements reflect explicit strategy. Here we compared eye movements during adaptation to two accepted measures of explicit learning - verbal report and the exclusion test. We found that while reporting, all subjects showed a match between all three measures. However, when subjects did not report their intention, the eye movements of some subjects suggested less explicit adaptation than what was measured in an exclusion test. Interestingly, subjects whose eye movements did match their exclusion could be clustered into two subgroups: fully implicit learners showing no evidence of explicit adaptation and explicit learners with little implicit adaptation. Subjects showing a mix of both explicit and implicit adaptation were also those where eye movements showed less explicit adaptation than did exclusion. Thus, our results support the idea of multiple components of explicit learning as only part of the explicit learning is reflected in the eye movements. Individual subjects may use explicit components that are reflected in the eyes or those that are not or some mixture of the two. Analysis of reaction times suggests that the explicit components reflected in the eye-movements involve longer reaction times. This component, according to recent literature, may be related to mental rotation.\\n\\nSignificance StatementVisuomotor adaptation involves both explicit and implicit components: aware re-aiming and unaware error correction. Recent studies suggest that eye movements could be used to capture the explicit component, a method that would have significant advantages over other approaches. We show that eye movements capture only one component of explicit adaptation. This component scales with reaction time while the component unrelated to eye movements does not. Our finding has obvious practical implications for the use of eye movements as a proxy for explicit learning. However, our results also corroborate recent findings suggesting the existence of multiple explicit components, and, specifically, their decomposition into components correlated with reaction time and components that are not.",

Vision models based on standard dynamic range luminance contrast ratios below 100 to 1 have limited ability to generalize to real-world scenes with contrast ratios over 10,000 to 1 (high dynamic range [HDR]). Understanding and modeling brain mechanisms of HDR luminance normalization is thus important for military applications, including automatic target recognition, display tone mapping, and camouflage. Yet, computer display of HDR stimuli was until recently unavailable or impractical for research. Here we describe procedures for setup, calibration, and precision check of an HDR display system with over 100,000 to 1 luminance dynamic range (650-0.0065 cd/m^2), pseudo 11-bit grayscale precision, and 3-ms temporal precision in the MATLAB/Psychtoolbox software environment. The setup is synchronized with electroencephalography and IR eye-tracking measurements. We report measures of HDR visual acuity and the discovery of a novel phenomenon--that abrupt darkening (from 400 to 4 cd/m^2) engages contextual facilitation, distorting the perceived orientation of a high-contrast central target. Surprisingly, the facilitation effect depended on luminance similarity, contradicting both classic divisive and subtractive models of contextual normalization.",

The objective of this experiment was to study adaptive regulatory mechanisms present during subsequent feeding transition periods and the inherent lipolytic activity of the adipose tissue in individuals with contrasted BR. Three diets containing different levels of energy were offered to 36 mature, dry, non-pregnant Merinos dArles ewes in an experiment lasting 122 days. Ewes were selected with similar body weight (BW), body condition score (BCS) and were allocated into three equivalent treatments according to the plane of nutrition: normally fed (Control); underfed (Under) or overfed (Over). The BW, BCS and individual energy metabolism were monitored. At the end of the experiment, lipolytic activity of adipose tissue was studied through a {beta}-adrenergic challenge to the same ewes, with body conditions according to the offered diet (Normal, Leans and Fat, respectively).\\n\\nResultsAnabolic or catabolic responses to energy dietary manipulation were accompanied by synchronised metabolic regulation, leading to contrasting metabolic and BR profiles. Average BW and BCS were higher and lower in Over and Under ewes, respectively. The higher and lower BR variations were observed for Under and Over ewes. Higher plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) concentrations were accompanied by lower insulin, leptin and glucose. Differences in leptin were consistent with the dietary energy load (Over > Control > Under). After refeeding, a rebound in BW and BCS was observed for the three groups whereas NEFA was drastically reduced in Under ewes. No differences among treatments were detected in NEFA profiles at the end of the study but lipolytic activity responses to the {beta} - adrenergic challenge were different and coherent with the adipose tissue mass (Fat > Normal > Lean) and, importantly, was also different between ewes from the same group or BR status, thus evidencing diversity among individual adaptive capacities.\\n\\nConclusionsThe ability of ewes to quickly overcome undernutrition situations by efficiently using their BR was confirmed. There is potential for a simplified {beta}-adrenergic challenge protocol helping to identify differences in adaptive capacity among individuals.",

Primiparous lactating ewes (n=43; 57.7{+/-}0.91 kg body weight [BW] at lambing), representative of a French Lacaune dairy flock, were allocated in an equilibrated 2 x 2 factorial design experiment, lasting for 63 days during mid-lactation and combining 2 litter sizes (singletons, SING or twins, TWIN) and 2 daily milking frequencies (once, ONE or twice, TWO). Ewes were individually fed a diet based on ryegrass silage, local hay and supplements. Individual DMI was recorded daily and further used to evaluate (and compare) differences in RFI between ewes at 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91 and 98 days relative to lambing (DIM). Total (BW) and metabolic (BW0.75) body weight, BCS, milk yield and plasma NEFA were monitored weekly. Differences in DMI were mainly due to the lactation stage and litter size and were 11% higher in ewes with TWIN compared to SING. This was positively correlated to milk yield and consistent with differences in RFI which varied due to litter size and to the milking frequency x lactation stage interaction. Ewes that lambed SING showed higher feed efficiency ({square}0.13{+/-}0.020 vs. 0.08{+/-}0.015 kg DM/ewe/d of RFI in SING vs. TWIN, respectively), whereas there was no differences in BW or BCS. Milking frequency did not affect DMI but milk yields were higher in TWO, which was related to a higher feed efficiency in this group (0.04{+/-}0.017 vs. {square}0.10{+/-}0.018 kg DM/ewe/d of RFI in ONE vs. TWO, respectively). Average RFI was affected (P <0.0001) by the ewe, thus allowing a ranking among individuals to be established. High (n=22) or low (n=21) feed efficiency ewes averaged {square}0.17{+/-}0.09 or 0.18{+/-}0.09 kg DM/d RFI, respectively. Estimates of RFI were not correlated to the individual milk production potential. Even if no differences in BW, BW0.75 or BCS were detected, high efficiency ewes mobilised almost two-fold their body reserves when compared to the low efficiency group. The observed intraflock variability in feed efficiency of this dairy ewes flock was affected by litter size and milking frequency but also by evident differences between individuals physiologies.",

    "abstract": "The transcription factor ERF109 acts as a crosstalk node between jasmonic acid signaling and auxin biosynthesis by directly regulating YUC2 and ASA1 during lateral root formation in Arabidopsis. However, whether ERF109 regulates the auxin transport remains unclear. Here we report a mechanism of ERF109-mediated auxin transport in root system. Through root transcriptome comparison between erf109, wild type, and 35S:ERF109, we found that the genes PIN2 and PIN4, encoding the major membrane-based efflux carriers of auxin, were enriched in the overexpression line. In the promoters of these auxin transport genes, GCC-box cis elements were found and potentially bound by ERF109. Moreover, PID, encoding a key regulator in polar auxin transport, was found upregulated in 35S:ERF109 and down regulated in erf109. Yeast-one-hybrid and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that ERF109 directly bound to the GCC-box of PIN2, PIN4, and PID. Genetic analyses with double mutants confirmed the function of ERF109 in the regulation of auxin transport in Arabidopsis roots. Taken together, our results show that ERF109 modulates auxin transport by directly regulating PIN2, PIN4 and PID. This ERF109-mediated auxin transport likely works together with ERF109-mediated auxin synthesis to establish auxin maxima for lateral root initiation.",

    "abstract": "Salinity is among the most severe and widespread environmental constrains to global crop production, especially in arid and semi-arid climates and negatively affecting productivity of salt sensitive crop species. Breeding and selection of salt tolerant crop varieties is therefore necessary for sustainable plant productivity. Given that germination and seeding phases are the most critical phase in the plant life cycle, this study aimed to evaluate seed germination potential and associated traits under salt stress conditions as a simple approach to identify salt tolerant Sorghum varieties. There Sorghum varieties whose adaptation to various agroclimatic conditions is not well elucidated. Salinity stress was applied by addition of NaCl at three different levels of stress (100, 200 and 300 mM NaCl), while plants irrigated with water were used as controls. Evaluation of tolerance was performed on the basis of germination percentage, shoot and seed water absorbance, shoot and root length, leave water content, seedling total chlorophyll content and morphologic abnormality. Our results showed that salinity stress significantly impacts all features associated with germination and early development of seedlings. Our results indicated that that salinity stress substantially affects all traits associated with germination and early seedling growth, with the effect of salinity being dependent on the variety used and level of salinity stress applied. Among the tested Sorghum varieties, Gadam was established to the most salt tolerant variety, suggesting its potential use for cultivation under salinity stress conditions as well as its suitability for use as germplasm material in future Sorghum breeding programmes. For a greater insight into comprehensive mechanisms of salinity tolerance in Sorghum, we suggest further research on genomic and molecular analysis.",

Here we combined lineage tracing, continuous monitoring of tumor mass, proliferation assays and transcriptomics with mathematical modeling and statistical inference to dissect the growth of glioblastoma in mice. We found that tumors grow exponentially at the rate of symmetric divisions of brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs). Spatial modeling predicts, and data show, that BTSCs accumulate at the tumor rim rather than in the core. The physiological differentiation hierarchy downstream of BTSCs is preserved in mice and humans: transit amplifying progenitors give rise to terminally differentiated cells. Consistent with our quantification of the mechanisms underlying tumor growth, molecular data show elevated expression of cell cycle-and migration-related genes in BTSCs. Our systematic approach reveals fundamental properties of glioblastoma and may be transferable to the study of other animal models of cancer.",

Many proteins implicated in ALS associate with stress granules, which are examples of liquid-like compartments formed by phase separation. Aberrant phase transition of stress granules has been implicated in disease, suggesting that modulation of phase transitions could be a possible therapeutic route. Here, we combine cell-based and protein-based screens to show that lipoamide, and its related compound lipoic acid, reduce the propensity of stress granule proteins to aggregate in vitro. More significantly, they also prevented aggregation of proteins over the life time of Caenorhabditis elegans. Observations that they prevent dieback of ALS patient-derived (FUS mutant) motor neuron axons in culture and recover motor defects in Drosophila melanogaster expressing FUS mutants suggest plausibility as effective therapeutics. Our results suggest that altering phase behaviour of stress granule proteins in the cytoplasm could be a novel route to treat ALS.",

Although it has been hypothesized that hybridization and diversification are correlated, this idea remains largely untested empirically. Here, we use a hybridization database on 195 plant families, life history information, and a time-calibrated family-level phylogeny to test for phylogenetically-corrected associations between hybridization and diversification rates, while also taking into account life-history traits that may be correlated with both processes. We show that diversification and hybridization are positively correlated using three different methods to estimate diversification rates and two different metrics of hybridization. Moreover, the relationship remains detectable when incorporating the correlations between diversification and two other life history characteristics, perenniality and woodiness. We further provide potential mechanisms for this association under three different scenarios: hybridization may drive diversification, diversification may drive hybridization, or both hybridization and diversification may jointly be driven by other factors.

    "abstract": "The environmental conditions of microorganisms habitats may fluctuate in unpredictable ways, such as changes in temperature, carbon source, pH, and salinity to name a few. Environmental heterogeneity presents a challenge to microorganisms, as they have to adapt not only to be fit under a specific condition, but they must also be robust across many conditions and be able to deal with the switch between conditions itself. While experimental evolution has been used to gain insight into the adaptive process, this has largely been in either unvarying or consistently varying conditions. In cases where changing environments have been investigated, relatively little is known about how such environments influence the dynamics of the adaptive process itself, as well as the genetic and phenotypic outcomes. We designed a systematic series of evolution experiments where we used two growth conditions that have differing timescales of adaptation and varied the rate of switching between them. We used lineage tracking to follow adaptation, and whole genome sequenced adaptive clones from each of the experiments. We find that both the switch rate and the order of the conditions influences adaptation, and that switching can both speed up and slow down adaptation, depending on those parameters. We also find different adaptive outcomes, at both the genetic and phenotypic levels, even when populations spent the same amount of total time in the two different conditions, but the order and/or switch rate differed. Thus, in a variable environment adaptation depends not only on the nature of the conditions and phenotypes under selection, but also on the complexity of the manner in which those conditions are combined to result in a given dynamic environment.",

    "abstract": "The origin and evolution of genes that have common base pairs (overlapping genes) are of particular interest due to their influencing each other. Especially intriguing are gene pairs with long overlaps. In prokaryotes, co-directional overlaps longer than 60 bp were shown to be nonexistent except for some instances. A few antiparallel prokaryotic genes with long overlaps were described in the literature. We have analyzed putative long antiparallel overlapping genes to determine whether open reading frames (ORFs) located opposite to genes (antiparallel ORFs) can be protein-coding genes.\\n\\nWe have confirmed that long antiparallel ORFs (AORFs) are observed reliably to be more frequent than expected. There are 10 472 000 AORFs in 929 analyzed genomes with overlap length more than 180 bp. Stop codons on the opposite to the coding strand are avoided in 2 898 cases with Benjamini-Hochberg threshold 0.01.\\n\\nUsing Ka/Ks ratio calculations, we have revealed that long AORFs do not affect the type of selection acting on genes in a vast majority of cases. This observation indicates that long AORFs translations commonly are not under negative selection.\\n\\nThe demonstrative example is 282 longer than 1 800 bp AORFs found opposite to extremely conserved dnaK genes. Translations of these AORFs were annotated \\\"glutamate dehydrogenases\\\" and were included into Pfam database as third protein family of glutamate dehydrogenases, PF10712. Ka/Ks analysis has demonstrated that if these translations correspond to proteins, they are not subjected by negative selection while dnaK genes are under strong stabilizing selection. Moreover, we have found other arguments against the hypothesis that these AORFs encode essential proteins, proteins indispensable for cellular machinery.\\n\\nHowever, some AORFs, in particular, dnaK related, have been found slightly resisting to synonymous changes in genes. It indicates the possibility of their translation. We speculate that translations of certain AORFs might have a functional role other than encoding essential proteins.\\n\\nEssential genes are unlikely to be encoded by AORFs in prokaryotic genomes. Nevertheless, some AORFs might have biological significance associated with their translations.\\n\\nAuthor summaryGenes that have common base pairs are called overlapping genes. We have examined the most intriguing case: if gene pairs encoded on opposite DNA strands exist in prokaryotes. An intersection length threshold 180 bp has been used. A few such pairs of genes were experimentally confirmed.\\n\\nWe have detected all long antiparallel ORFs in 929 prokaryotic genomes and have found that the number of open reading frames, located opposite to annotated genes, is much more than expected according to statistical model. We have developed a measure of stop codon avoidance on the opposite strand. The lengths of found antiparallel ORFs with stop codon avoidance are typical for prokaryotic genes.\\n\\nComparative genomics analysis shows that long antiparallel ORFs (AORFs) are unlikely to be essential protein-coding genes. We have analyzed distributions of features typical for essential proteins among formal translations of all long AORFs: prevalence of negative selection, non-uniformity of a conserved positions distribution in a multiple alignment of homologous proteins, the character of homologs distribution in phylogenetic tree of prokaryotes. All of them have not been observed for the majority of long AORFs. Particularly, the same results have been obtained for some experimentally confirmed AOGs.\\n\\nThus, pairs of antiparallel overlapping essential genes are unlikely to exist. On the other hand, some antiparallel ORFs affect the evolution of genes opposite that they are located. Consequently, translations of some antiparallel ORFs might have yet unknown biological significance.",

To further investigate the secondary metabolite repertoire of underexploited bacterial families, we chose to analyze a novel representative of the yet untapped bacterial phylum Planctomycetes for the production of secondary metabolites under laboratory culture conditions. Development of a planctomycetal high density cultivation technique in combination with high resolution mass spectrometric analysis revealed Planctomycetales strain 10988 to produce the plant toxin 3,5 dibromo p-anisic acid. This molecule represents the first secondary metabolite reported from any planctomycete. Genome mining revealed the biosynthetic origin of this doubly brominated secondary metabolite and a biosynthesis model for the com-pound was devised. Comparison of the biosynthetic route to biosynthetic gene clusters responsible for formation of polybrominated small aromatic compounds reveals evidence for an evolutionary link, while the compounds herbicidal activity points towards an ambivalent role of the metabolite in the planctomycetal ecosystem.",

The sensitivity of the diagnostic approaches for the dominant P. falciparum were comparable, detecting approx. 80% infection, but not so for non-falciparum species - 3% and 10% infection for P. malariae; 0% and 3% infection for P. ovale by microscopy and qPCR respectively, across communities. P. ovale prevalence was less than 5%. Infection rates for P. malariae varied between age groups, with the highest rates in individuals > 5 years. P. malariae specific seroprevalence rates fluctuated in those < 10 years but generally reached the peak around 20 years of age for all peptides. The heterogeneity and rates of these non-falciparum species calls for increased specific diagnosis and targeting by elimination strategies.",

    "abstract": "Activity dependent and independent functions for some enzymes are indispensable as significant biological regulators. Deacylase SIRT6 is well-known to improve stress resistance and promote lifespan extension through enzymatic activity-dependent gene silencing. However, whether and how SIRT6 non-enzymatically actives the transcriptional output hasnt been characterized. Here, we revealed SIRT6 as a coactivator of GATA4, an essential transcription factor for postnatal cardiomyocyte survival, promoting the expression of anti-apoptotic gene. Chemotherapeutic drug, doxorubicin (DOX), remarkably and rapidly decreased SIRT6 expression, leading to transcriptional repression of GATA4 and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Interestingly, SIRT6 interacted with GATA4 yet enhanced GATA4 acetylation independent of its deacylase activity, by recruiting the acetyltransferase Tip60 to form a trimeric complex. Nonacyl-mimetic mutation of GATA4 thoroughly blocked its ability against DOX cardiotoxicity. Moreover, Sirt6 transgenic mice exhibited preserved cardiac function with attenuated GATA4 activity in response to DOX. Thus, our studies uncover a previously unrecognized role of SIRT6 in cardioprotection independently of deacylase activity, providing the molecular basis to prevent chemotherapeutic side effects.",

    "abstract": "Prediction of clinical drug response (CDR) of cancer patients, based on their clinical and molecular profiles obtained prior to administration of the drug, can play a significant role in individualized medicine. Machine learning models have the potential to address this issue, but training them requires data from a large number of patients treated with each drug, limiting their feasibility. While large databases of drug response and molecular profiles of preclinical in-vitro cancer cell lines (CCLs) exist for many drugs, it is unclear whether preclinical samples can be used to predict CDR of real patients.\\n\\nWe designed a systematic approach to evaluate how well different algorithms, trained on gene expression and drug response of CCLs, can predict CDR of patients. Using data from two large databases, we evaluated various linear and non-linear algorithms, some of which utilized information on gene interactions. Then, we developed a new algorithm called TG-LASSO that explicitly integrates information on samples tissue of origin with gene expression profiles to improve prediction performance. Our results showed that regularized regression methods provide significantly accurate prediction. However, including the network information or common methods of including information on the tissue of origin did not improve the results. On the other hand, TG-LASSO improved the predictions and distinguished resistant and sensitive patients for 7 out of 13 drugs. Additionally, TG-LASSO identified genes associated with the drug response, including known targets and pathways involved in the drugs mechanism of action. Moreover, genes identified by TG-LASSO for multiple drugs in a tissue were associated with patient survival. In summary, our analysis suggests that preclinical samples can be used to predict CDR of patients and identify biomarkers of drug sensitivity and survival.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYCancer is among the leading causes of death globally and perdition of the drug response of patients to different treatments based on their clinical and molecular profiles can enable individualized cancer medicine. Machine learning algorithms have the potential to play a significant role in this task; but, these algorithms are designed based the premise that a large number of labeled training samples are available, and these samples are accurate representation of the profiles of real tumors. However, due to ethical and technical reasons, it is not possible to screen humans for many drugs, significantly limiting the size of training data. To overcome this data scarcity problem, machine learning models can be trained using large databases of preclinical samples (e.g. cancer cell line cultures). However, due to the major differences between preclinical samples and real tumors, it is unclear how accurately such preclinical-to-clinical computational models can predict the clinical drug response of cancer patients.\\n\\nHere, first we systematically evaluate a variety of different linear and nonlinear machine learning algorithms for this particular task using two large databases of preclinical (GDSC) and tumor samples (TCGA). Then, we present a novel method called TG-LASSO that utilizes a new approach for explicitly incorporating the tissue of origin of samples in the prediction task. Our results show that TG-LASSO outperforms all other algorithms and can accurately distinguish resistant and sensitive patients for the majority of the tested drugs. Follow-up analysis reveal that this method can also identify biomarkers of drug sensitivity in each cancer type.",

HOTAIR emerged as one of the most renowned long noncoding RNAs promoting EMT mostly as a scaffold for PRC2 and repressive histone H3 Lys27 methylation at gene promoters. In addition to PRC2, HOTAIR interacts with the Lsd1 lysine demethylase, a known epigenetic regulator of cell fate during development and differentiation. However, Lsd1 role in HOTAIR function is still poorly understood. Here, through expression of truncated variants of HOTAIR, we revealed that, in contrast to PRC2, its Lsd1-interacting domain is essential for acquisition of migratory properties by epithelial cells. HOTAIR induces Lsd1 relocation from its inherent genomic loci hence reprogramming the epithelial transcriptome. Our results uncovered an unexpected role of HOTAIR in EMT as an Lsd1 effector and pointed to the importance of Lsd1 as a guardian of the epithelial identity.",

Although different in vitro or in vivo models have been described, further comprehensive approaches are needed to study specific parts of the disease. This study aimed to combine in vitro and in silico modeling to describe cellular and matrix-related changes during the early phase of OA. We developed an in vitro OA model based on scaffold-free cartilage-like constructs (SFCCs), which was mathematically modeled using a partial differential equation (PDE) system to resemble the processes during the onset of OA.\\n\\nDesignSFCCs were produced from mesenchymal stromal cells and analyzed weekly by histology and qPCR to characterize the cellular and matrix-related composition. To simulate the early phase of OA, SFCCs were treated with interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}), tumor necrosis factor  (TNF) and examined after 3 weeks or cultivated another 3 weeks without inflammatory cytokines to validate the regeneration potential. Mathematical modeling was performed in parallel to the in vitro experiments.\\n\\nResultsSFCCs expressed cartilage-specific markers, and after stimulation an increased expression of inflammatory markers, matrix degrading enzymes, a loss of collagen II (Col-2) and a reduced cell density was observed which could be partially reversed by retraction of stimulation. Based on the PDEs, the distribution processes within the SFCCs, including those of IL-1{beta}, Col-2 degradation and cell number reduction was simulated.\\n\\nConclusionsBy combining in vitro and in silico methods, we aimed to develop a valid, efficient alternative approach to examine and predict disease progression and new therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "There is mounting evidence that mosquitoes harbour an extensive diversity of  insect-specific RNA viruses in addition to those important to human and animal health. However, because most studies of the mosquito virome have been conducted at lower latitudes there is a major knowledge gap on the genetic diversity, evolutionary history, and spread of RNA viruses sampled from mosquitoes in northern latitudes. Here, we determined and compared the RNA virome of two common northern Culex mosquito species, Cx. pipiens and Cx. torrentium, known vectors of West Nile virus and Sindbis virus, respectively, collected in south-central Sweden. Following bulk RNA-sequencing (meta-transcriptomics) of 12 libraries, comprising 120 specimens of Cx. pipiens and 150 specimens of Cx. torrentium, we identified 40 viruses (representing 14 virus families) of which 28 were novel based on phylogenetic analysis of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein. Hence, we found similar levels of virome diversity as in mosquitoes sampled from the more biodiverse lower latitudes. Four libraries, all from Cx. torrentium, had a significantly higher abundance of viral reads, spanning [~]7- 36% of the total amount of reads. Many of these viruses were also related to those sampled on other continents, indicative of widespread global movement and/or long host-virus co-evolution. Importantly, although the two mosquito species investigated have overlapping geographical distributions and share many viruses, approximately one quarter of the viruses were only found at a specific location, such that geography must play an important role in shaping the diversity of RNA viruses in Culex mosquitoes.\\n\\nImportanceRNA viruses are found in all domains of life and all global habitats. However, the factors that determine virome composition and structure within and between organisms are largely unknown. Herein, we characterised RNA virus diversity in two common mosquito vector species, Culex pipiens and Culex torrentium, sampled from northern Europe. Our analysis revealed extensive viral diversity, including 28 novel viruses, and was comparable to the levels of diversity found in other temperate and tropical regions globally. Importantly, as well as harbouring RNA viruses that are closely related to other mosquito-derived viruses sampled in diverse global locations, we also described a number of viruses that are unique to specific sampling locations in Sweden. Hence, these data showed that geographical factors can play an important role in shaping virome structure even at local scales.",

To date, 16 ARVC causative genes have been identified from human genetic studies, accounting for about 60% of ARVC probands. Genetic basis for the remaining 40% ARVC probands remain elusive.\\n\\nMETHODSPrompted by a zebrafish mutagenesis screen that suggested the Sorbin and SH3 domain-containing 2 (SORBS2) ortholog as a candidate cardiomyopathy gene, we conducted detailed expressionl analysis of Sorbs2 in mice, as well as phenotypic characterization in the Sorbs2 knock-out (KO) mice. The intercalated disc (ICD) expression pattern and ARVC-like phenotypes further prompted us to conduct targeted sequencing of human patients with ARVC to search for rare variants in the SORBS2 gene.\\n\\nRESULTSSorbs2 is robustly expressed in the mouse heart, encoding an adhesion junction/desmosome protein that is mainly localized to the ICD. A mutation with near complete depletion of the Sorbs2 protein in mouse results in phenotypes characteristic of human ARVC, such as dilated right ventricle (RV), RV dysfunction, spontaneous ventricular tachycardia (VT), and premature death. Sorbs2 is required to maintain the structural integrity of ICD. Its absence resulted in profound cardiac electrical remodeling with impaired impulse conduction and action potential derangements. Five rare variants were identified from a cohort of 59 ARVC patients, among which two variants affect splicing.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSSorbs2 KO mouse is an ARVC model and SORBS2 is a new ARVC susceptibility gene.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWhilst much sequencing effort has focused on key mammalian model organisms such as mouse and human, little is known about the correlation between genome sequencing techniques for non-model mammals and genome assembly quality. This is especially relevant to non-model mammals, where the samples to be sequenced are often degraded and low quality. A key aspect when planning a genome project is the choice of sequencing data to generate. This decision is driven by several factors, including the biological questions being asked, the quality of DNA available, and the availability of funds. Cutting-edge sequencing technologies now make it possible to achieve highly contiguous, chromosome-level genome assemblies, but relies on good quality high-molecular-weight DNA. The funds to generate and combining these data are often only available within large consortiums and sequencing initiatives, and are often not affordable for many independent research groups. For many researchers, value-for-money is a key factor when considering the generation of genomic sequencing data. Here we use a range of different genomic technologies generated from a roadkill European Polecat (Mustela putorius) to assess various assembly techniques on this low-quality sample. We evaluated different approaches for de novo assemblies and discuss their value in relation to biological analyses.\\n\\nResultsGenerally, assemblies containing more data types achieved better scores in our ranking system. However, when accounting for misassemblies, this was not always the case for Bionano and low-coverage 10x Genomics (for scaffolding only). We also find that the extra cost associated with combining multiple data types is not necessarily associated with better genome assemblies.\\n\\nConclusionsThe high degree of variability between each de novo assembly method (assessed from the seven key metrics) highlights the importance of carefully devising the sequencing strategy to be able to carry out the desired analysis. Adding more data to genome assemblies not always results in better assemblies so it is important to understand the nuances of genomic data integration explained here, in order to obtain cost-effective value-for-money when sequencing genomes.",

However, the molecular basis for this transformation and its distribution among gut microorganisms are poorly understood.

Our findings suggest that this activity enables E. lenta to use dopamine as an electron acceptor under anaerobic conditions. In addition to characterizing catecholamine dehydroxylation, we identify candidate molybdenum-dependent enzymes that dehydroxylate additional host-and plant-derived small molecules. These gut bacterial catechol dehydroxylases are specific in their substrate scope and transcriptional regulation and belong to a distinct group of largely uncharacterized molybdenum-dependent enzymes that likely mediate both primary and secondary metabolism in multiple environments. Finally, we observe catechol dehydroxylation in the gut microbiotas of diverse mammals, suggesting that this chemistry is present in habitats beyond the human gut. Altogether, our data reveal the molecular basis of catechol dehydroxylation among gut bacteria and suggest that the chemical strategies that mediate metabolism and interactions in the human gut are relevant to a broad range of species and habitats.",

    "abstract": "Striatal oscillatory activity is associated with movement, reward, and decision-making, and observed in several interacting frequency bands. Local field potential recordings in rodent striatum show dopamine- and reward-dependent transitions between two states: a \"spontaneous\" state involving {beta} (~15-30 Hz) and low{gamma} (~40-60 Hz), and a state involving{theta} (~4-8 Hz) and high{gamma} (~60-100 Hz) in response to dopaminergic agonism and reward. The mechanisms underlying these rhythmic dynamics, their interactions, and their functional consequences are not well understood. In this paper, we propose a biophysical model of striatal microcircuits that comprehensively describes the generation and interaction of these rhythms, as well as their modulation by dopamine. Building on previous modeling and experimental work suggesting that striatal projection neurons (SPNs) are capable of generating {beta} oscillations, we show that networks of striatal fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) are capable of generating{delta} /{theta} (ie, 2 to 6 Hz) and{gamma} rhythms. Under simulated low dopaminergic tone our model FSI network produces low{gamma} band oscillations, while under high dopaminergic tone the FSI network produces high{gamma} band activity nested within a{delta} /{theta} oscillation. SPN networks produce {beta} rhythms in both conditions, but under high dopaminergic tone, this {beta} oscillation is interrupted by{delta} /{theta}-periodic bursts of{gamma} -frequency FSI inhibition. Thus, in the high dopamine state, packets of FSI{gamma} and SPN {beta} alternate at a{delta} /{theta} timescale. In addition to a mechanistic explanation for previously observed rhythmic interactions and transitions, our model suggests a hypothesis as to how the relationship between dopamine and rhythmicity impacts motor function. We hypothesize that high dopamine-induced periodic FSI{gamma} -rhythmic inhibition enables switching between {beta}-rhythmic SPN cell assemblies representing the currently active motor program, and thus that dopamine facilitates movement in part by allowing for rapid, periodic shifts in motor program execution.\n\nAuthor summaryStriatal oscillatory activity is associated with movement, reward, and decision-making, and observed in several interacting frequency bands.

    "abstract": "Soil salinity is one of the most important abiotic stresses affecting plant growth. In legumes, symbiotic nitrogen fixation in nodules is affected by salt stress, and salinity tolerance is variable among species. Genes from the High affinity K+ Transporter (HKT) family are known to play crucial roles in salt stress tolerance in different plant species. In legumes these transporters are still very poorly characterized.. Here we study the HKT transporter family from the model legume Medicago trunacatula, which is moderately tolerant to salinity. The genome of this species comprises five HKT genes, hereafter named MtHKT1;1 to MtHKT1;5. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the MtHKT polypeptides belong to HKT subfamily 1. Three members (MtHKT1;2, MtHKT1;4 and MtHKT1;5) of the Medicago truncatula family were cloned and expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Their electrophysiological properties revealed a permeability 10 times higher for Na+ than for K+ and varying rectification properties. Expression analyses of the three MtHKT genes under different biotic and abiotic conditions suggested that MtHKT1;5 is the main transporter from this family in the root, the three genes sharing a decrease of expression in drought and salt stress conditions in non inoculated plants as well as plants inoculated with rhizobia. In the shoot, the three MtHKT would be present at similar levels independently on the applied stresses. Based on biomass and ion content analysis, the nodule appeared as the most sensitive organ to the applied salt and drought stresses. The level of expression of the three MtHKT genes was strongly decreased by both stresses in the nodule.",

    "abstract": "Intra-tumoral heterogeneity (ITH) is the fundamental property of cancer, however, the origin of ITH remains poorly understood. Here we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) from 20 patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC), constructed a transcriptome map of 45,048 PC cells, determined the cell-of-origin of each tumor cell, and incisively explored ITH of PC tumor cells at single-cell resolution. The links between cell-of-origin and ITH was illustrated at transcriptomic, genotypic, molecular, and phenotypic levels. This study characterized the origins of PC tumor cells that populate and thrive in the peritoneal cavity, uncovered the diversity in tumor cell-of-origins and defined it as a key determinant of ITH. Furthermore, cell-of-origin-based analysis classified PC into two cellular subtypes that were prognostic independent of clinical variables, and a 12-gene prognostic signature was then derived and validated in multiple large-scale GAC cohorts. The prognostic signature appears fundamental to GAC carcinogenesis/progression and could be practical for patient stratification.",

Here we suggest a novel and generic synthesis of stochasticity-induced stabilization (SIS) phenomena. The storage effect in the lottery model, together with other well-known examples drawn from population genetics, microbiology and ecology, are placed together, reviewed, and explained within a clear, coherent and transparent theoretical framework. Implementing the diffusion approximation we show that in all these systems (including discrete and continuous dynamics, with overlapping and non-overlapping generations) the ratio between the expected growth and its variance governs both qualitative and quantitative features of persistence and invasibility. We further clarify the relationships between bet-hedging strategies, generation time and SIS, study the dynamics of extinction when SIS fails and the explain effects of species richness and asymmetric competition on the stabilizing mechanism.",

    "abstract": "A large body of research shows that biodiversity loss can reduce ecosystem functioning, thus providing support for the conservation of biological diversity1-4. Much of the evidence for this relationship is drawn from biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiments (hereafter: biodiversity experiments), in which biodiversity loss is simulated by randomly assembling communities of varying species diversity, and ecosystem functions are measured5-9. This random assembly has led some ecologists to question the relevance of biodiversity experiments to real-world ecosystems, where community assembly may often be non-random and influenced by external drivers, such as climate or land-use intensification10-18. Despite these repeated criticisms, there has been no comprehensive, quantitative assessment of how experimental and real-world plant communities really differ, and whether these differences invalidate the experimental results. Here, we compare data from two of the largest and longest-running grassland biodiversity experiments globally (Jena Experiment, Germany; BioDIV, USA) to related real-world grassland plant communities in terms of their taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity and functional-trait composition. We found that plant communities of biodiversity experiments have greater variance in these compositional features than their real-world counterparts, covering almost all of the variation of the real-world communities (82-96%) while also containing community types that are not currently observed in the real world. We then re-analysed a subset of experimental data that included only ecologically-realistic communities, i.e. those comparable to real-world communities. For ten out of twelve biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships, biodiversity effects did not differ significantly between the full dataset of biodiversity experiments and the ecologically-realistic subset of experimental communities. This demonstrates that the results of biodiversity experiments are largely insensitive to the inclusion/exclusion of unrealistic communities. By bridging the gap between experimental and real-world studies, these results demonstrate the validity of inferences from biodiversity experiments, a key step in translating their results into specific recommendations for real-world biodiversity management.",

Differentiating between closely related species could therefore utilise an  average p-dist of 2.5%. Despite the smaller B. tabaci mtCOI dataset, six putative new species were identified.

    "abstract": "The complex aetiology of schizophrenia is postulated to share factors with other psychiatric disorders. Recently, this has been supported by genome-wide association studies, with several psychiatric phenotypes displaying high genomic correlation with schizophrenia. We sought to investigate pleiotropy amongst the common variant genomics of schizophrenia and seven other psychiatric disorders using a multimarker test of association. Gene-based analysis of common variation revealed over 50 schizophrenia-associated genes shared with other psychiatric phenotypes; including bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, ADHD, and autism spectrum disorder. In addition, we uncovered 78 genes significantly enriched with common variant associations for schizophrenia that were not linked to any of these seven disorders (P > 0.05). Transcriptomic imputation was then leveraged to investigate the functional significance of variation mapped to these genes, prioritising several interesting functional candidates. Pairwise meta-analysis of schizophrenia and each psychiatric phenotype further revealed 330 significantly associated genes (PMeta < 2.7 x 10-6) that were only nominally associated with each disorder individually (P < 0.05). Multivariable gene-set association suggested that common variation enrichment within biologically constrained genes observed for schizophrenia also occurs across several psychiatric phenotypes. These analyses consolidate the overlap between the genomic architecture of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders and uncovered several pleiotropic genes which warrant further investigation.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYSchizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders have many similarities, and this includes features of their overall genetic risk. Here, we investigate genes which may play a role in schizophrenia as well one or more of seven other psychiatric phenotypes and demonstrate that a number of them are pleiotropic and influence at least one other disorder. We also identify genes amongst the psychiatric disorders studied here which only show association with schizophrenia. Furthermore, we find a number of genes which were only significant when combining genetic association data from schizophrenia and one of the other seven disorders, suggesting there are shared genetic influences that are revealed through the power of joint analysis. This study identifies interesting novel shared (pleiotropic) genes in psychiatry which warrant future study.",

    "abstract": "Imprinted genes are expressed from a single parental allele. In mammals, this unusual mode of transcription generally depends on the epigenetic silencing of one allele by DNA methylation (DNAme) established in the germline. While many species-specific imprinted orthologues have been documented in eutherians, the molecular mechanisms underlying the evolutionary switch from biallelic to imprinted expression are currently unknown. During mouse oogenesis, gametic differentially methylated regions (gDMRs) acquire DNAme in a process guided by transcription. Here we show that transcription initiating in proximal lineage-specific endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) is likely responsible for DNAme established in oocytes at 4/6 mouse-specific and 17/110 human-specific maternal imprinted gDMRs (igDMRs). The latter can be further divided into Catarrhini (Old World monkeys and apes)- or Hominoidea (ape)-specific igDMRs, which are embedded within transcription units initiating in ERVs specific to these primate lineages. Using CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis, we deleted the relevant murine-specific ERVs upstream of the maternally methylated genes Impact and Slc38a4. Strikingly, imprinting at these genes was lost in the offspring of females harboring these deletions and biallelic expression was observed. Our work reveals a novel evolutionary mechanism whereby maternally silenced genes arise from biallelically expressed progenitors.",

    "abstract": "HLA, the coding genes of human major histocompatibility (MHC) proteins, play a crucial role in the human adaptive immune system by presenting antigenic peptides to T cell receptors on T cells. HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C, these 3 Class I HLA genes are one of the most polymorphic loci in the human genome. For decades, HLA typing has been performed prior to tissue and stem cell transplantation. However, beyond the role in tissue matching, HLA has also been implicated in a wide array of autoimmune diseases and HLA genotypes and expression levels are closely associated with cancer patients prognosis as recent studies have revealed. Recently methods have been developed to perform HLA typing and HLA expression quantification together by using RNA-seq techniques. However, these bulk RNA-seq experiments are measuring an averaged signal of cell populations. Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) has regained its popularity due to its power to reliably resolve single RNA transcriptomes at large scales. In our present study, we did HLA typing using three independent scRNA-seq datasets. Interestingly, we found that single cells from the same donor could be classified into different groups where each group has a distinct expressed HLA genotype (e.g., HLA-A, heterozygous or homozygous); in other words, HLA class I genes show abundant allele specific expression in single cells. This phenomenon has been repeatedly observed in a total of 14 donors from 3 independent datasets (one is breast epithelium, another two are multiple myeloma). Our systematic analysis of HLA class I gene expression using multiple scRNA-seq datasets has uncovered a putative mechanism, where by fine tuning HLA class I expressions both at the quantity and allele levels, our immune system is able to handle various internal challenges through single cells equipped with extraordinary diverse HLA expression patterns.",

Importantly, by comparing laboratory-reared and wild-caught animals we identified responses specifically associated with healing outcome. Fibrotic repair showed a greater local release of IL-6, CCL2 and CXCL1. Conversely, regeneration showed decreased circulating IL-5, IL-6, IL-17, CCL3 and CXCL1 and increased local IL-12 and IL-17. The differential IL-6 response was substantiated by increased pSTAT3 during the inflammatory phase of fibrotic repair and with blastema formation and tissue morphogenesis in Acomys. COX-2 inhibition was not sufficient to induce regeneration. Interestingly, a unique influx of lymphocytes was coupled with regeneration and RNA-expression analysis suggested they were regulatory T cells.

Contemporary explorations are founded upon neuropsychological investigations of semantic dementia (SD) that describe the patients selective semantic impairment and the variations in their language, behavioural and face recognition abilities. The purpose of this investigation was to generate a single unified model which captures the known cognitive-behavioural variations in SD, and integrates with the considerable database on healthy semantic function and other patient groups. A new analytical approach was able to capture the graded neuropsychological differences and map these to the patients distribution of frontotemporal atrophy. Multiple regression and principal component analyses confirmed that the degree of generalised semantic impairment was related to the patients total, bilateral ATL atrophy. Verbal production and word-finding abilities were related to total ATL atrophy as well as to the balance of left>right ATL atrophy. Behavioural apathy was found to relate positively to the degree of orbitofrontal atrophy and negatively to total temporal volumes. Disinhibited behaviour was related to right ATL and orbitofrontal atrophy and face recognition to right ATL volumes. Rather than positing mutually-exclusive sub-categories, the data-driven model repositions semantics, language, social behaviour and face recognition into a continuous frontotemporal neurocognitive space.",

Here, we demonstrate that current stimulation paradigms fail to reproduce the stochastic and asynchronous properties of natural patterns of neural activity, and introduce a novel biomimetic stimulation (BioS) strategy that overcomes these limitations. We hypothesized that high-frequency amplitude-modulated bursts of stimulation could induce asynchronous neural firings by distributing recruitment over the duration of a burst, without sacrificing the ability to precisely control neural activity. We tested this hypothesis using computer simulations and ex vivo experiments. We found that BioS bursts induce asynchronous, stochastic, yet controllable, neural activity. We established that varying the amplitude, duration, and repetition frequency of a BioS burst enables graded modulation of the number of recruited fibers, their firing rate, and the synchronicity of the responses. These results demonstrate an unprecedented level of control over artificially induced neural activity, enabling the design of next-generation biomimetic stimulation paradigms with potentially profound consequences for the field of neurostimulation.",

Singers produce two pitches simultaneously: a booming low-frequency rumble alongside a hovering high-pitched whistle-like tone. The biomechanics of this biphonation are not well-understood. Here, we use sound analysis, dynamic magnetic resonance imaging, and vocal tract modeling to demonstrate how biphonation is achieved by modulating vocal tract morphology. Tuvan singers show remarkable control in shaping their vocal tract to narrowly focus the harmonics (or overtones) emanating from their vocal cords. The biphonic sound is a combination of the fundamental pitch and a focused filter state, which is at the higher pitch (1-2 kHz) and formed by merging two formants, thereby greatly enhancing sound-production in a very narrow frequency range. Most importantly, we demonstrate that this biphonation is a phenomenon arising from linear filtering rather than a nonlinear source.",

    "abstract": "Prairies, once spanning the Upper Midwest, have now largely been replaced by agriculture. The lack of resources available to pollinators in agricultural fields and practices commonly employed has led to a decline in insect diversity. To enhance sustainable practices, we must better understand how ecosystem services such as pest control and pollination services provided by a diverse insect and pollinator community scale to current farming practices as related to crop yield and how landscape features may positively contribute to insect and pollinator diversity. We examined how landscape heterogeneity relates to insect and pollinator diversity, as well as how insect and pollinator diversity relates to crop yield across common farming practices. We planted 35 single acre sites of Brassica carinata, a generalist flower possibly capable of supporting a diverse insect community. We randomly assigned each site with a combination of three common farming practices: tilling (yes/no), added honey bee hives (yes/no), and treatment with systemic neonicotinoids (yes/no). Insect and pollinator diversity and the surrounding landscape at multiple spatial scales were calculated. We observed a significant positive relationship between insect (and pollinator) diversity with yield in the absence of any farming practice. All farming practices will increase yield. However, farming practices alter the relationship between yield and diversity. The addition of seed treatment or tillage negates the relationship between insect (and pollinator) diversity with yield. Seed treatment alone results in a flat relationship between diversity and yield for all insects and a negative relationship for pollinators. Increased landscape heterogeneity results in a positive relationship between insect diversity at the 1000 m scale and pollinator diversity at the 3000 m scale, suggesting large-scale heterogeneity contributes to overall insect diversity. Our results show that increasing large-scale landscape heterogeneity increases diversity serving as a substitute for common farming practices such as application of pesticides, tilling, or bee hives. Increased heterogeneity could save farmers from the input cost of treatment or tillage, by way of increased insect diversity, while still providing similar yields.",

    "abstract": "Habitat loss and fragmentation causes decline of insect populations. Odonata (both dragonflies and damselflies) are especially threatened, because they are notably influenced by both aquatic and terrestrial environment. We explored the relative importance of local and landscape variables for Odonata assemblages (species richness, assemblage composition, population abundance) revealing differences in the sensitivity of Zygoptera and Anisoptera on the selected variables. Our study took two years and was placed along 11 lowland watercourses. We sampled the specimens using 500 m long transects from May to September. Landscape variables (length of watercourses, forest patch proportion, and farmland patch size) were calculated at three scales to better account for fragmentation. Our findings show that local variables influence damselflies, but dragonflies are more sensitive to landscape variables. Damselflys diversity decreased with the increasing macrovegetation cover, while dragonflys diversity decreased with the increasing degree of land use intensification, but increased with the length of watercourses. Our findings, both on local and landscape scales demonstrated the importance of terrestrial environment on Odonata. Based on our findings we stress the importance of partial watercourse clearing, and maintenance of traditional farm management based on small parcel farming near watercourses to maintain diverse and healthy Odonata assemblages.",

    "abstract": "Chromothripsis and kataegis are frequently observed in cancer and can arise from telomere crisis, a period of genome instability during tumorigenesis when depletion of the telomere reserve generates unstable dicentric chromosomes1-5. Here we report on the mechanism underlying chromothripsis and kataegis using an in vitro telomere crisis model. We show that the cytoplasmic exonuclease TREX1, which promotes the resolution of dicentric chromosomes4, plays a prominent role in chromothriptic fragmentation. In absence of TREX1, the genome alterations induced by telomere crisis primarily involve Breakage-Fusion-Bridge cycles and simple genome rearrangements rather than chromothripsis. Furthermore, we show that the kataegis observed at chromothriptic breakpoints is the consequence of cytosine deamination by APOBEC3B. In addition, APOBEC3B increased the frequency of chromothriptic fragmentation, possibly due to strand breakage after cytosine deamination. These data reveal that chromothripsis and kataegis arise from a combination of nucleolytic processing by TREX1 and cytosine editing by APOBEC3B.",

    "abstract": "Inositol pyrophosphates (PP-InsPs) are an emerging class of \\\"high-energy\\\" intracellular signaling molecules containing one or two diphosphate groups attached to an inositol ring, with suggested roles in bioenergetic homeostasis and inorganic phosphate (Pi) sensing. Information regarding the biosynthesis of these unique class of signaling molecules in plants is scarce, however the enzymes responsible for their biosynthesis in other eukaryotes have been well described. Here we report the characterization of the two Arabidopsis VIP kinase domains, a newly discovered activity of the Arabidopsis ITPK1 and ITPK2 enzymes, and the subcellular localization of the enzymes involved in the synthesis of InsP6 and PP-InsPs. Our data indicate that AtVIP1-KD and AtVIP2-KD act primarily as 1PP-specific Diphosphoinositol Pentakisphosphate Kinases (PPIP5) Kinases. The AtITPK enzymes, in contrast, can function as InsP6 kinases, and thus are the missing enzyme in the plant PP-InsP synthesis pathway. Together, these enzyme classes can function in plants to produce PP-InsPs, which have been implicated in signal transduction and Pi sensing pathways. We measured a higher InsP7 level (increased InsP7/InsP8 ratio) in vip1/vip2 double loss-of-function mutants, and an accumulation of InsP8 (decreased InsP7/InsP8 ratio) in the 35S:VIP2 overexpression line relative to wild-type plants. We also report that enzymes involved in the synthesis of InsPs and PP-InsPs accumulate within the nucleus and cytoplasm of plant cells. Our work defines a molecular basis for understanding how plants synthesize PP-InsPs which is crucial for determining the roles of these signaling molecules in processes such as Pi sensing.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTInositol pyrophosphate signaling molecules are of agronomic importance as they can control complex responses to the limited nutrient, phosphate. This work fills in the missing steps in the inositol pyrophosphate synthesis pathway and points to a role for these molecules in the plant cell nucleus. This is an important advance that can help us design future strategies to increase phosphate efficiency in plants.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional Interference (TI) has been shown to regulate gene expression at the DNA level via different molecular mechanisms. The obstacles present on the DNA that a transcribing RNA Polymerase might encounter, e.g. a DNA-bound protein or another RNA Polymerase, can result in TI causing termination of transcription, thus reducing gene expression. However, the potential of TI as a new strategy to engineer complex gene expression modules has not been fully explored yet. Here we created a series of two-input devices using the presence of a roadblocking protein using both experimental and mathematical modeling approaches. We explore how multiple characteristics affect the response of genetic devices engineered to act like either AND, OR, or Single Input logic gates. We show that the dissociation constant of the roadblocking protein, inducer activation of promoter and operator sites, and distance between tandem promoters tune gate behavior. This work highlights the potential of rationally creating different types of genetic responses using the same transcription factors in subtly different genetic architectures.",

    "abstract": "The prototypic henipaviruses (HNV), Hendra (HeV) and Nipah (NiV), are emergent zoonotic pathogens responsible for frequent and fatal outbreaks of severe disease in domestic animals and humans. The HNV attachment glycoprotein (G) is a critical determinant of host-species and cell-type tropism. Utilization of highly conserved B-type ephrin ligands as functional entry receptors engenders HNVs with a broad permissive host range, accounts for zoonotic spillover, and is closely aligned with observed disease pathologies. Recent studies have uncovered numerous divergent clades of HNVs globally. Cedar virus (CedV), the closest relative of HeV and NiV identified to date, can establish experimental infections, yet has not been observed to cause overt disease. While the apathogenic phenotype may be attributed to a lack of P-gene derived interferon antagonists, the V and W accessory proteins, additional determinants of differential HNV pathobiology could be involved. Here, through comparative functional and structural analysis of CedV-G, we characterize molecular interactions critical to viral entry. We demonstrate that CedV possesses a unique cellular entry receptor repertoire which, in addition to functional utilization of the common HNV receptor, ephrin-B2, includes the hitherto uncharacterized interaction with ephrin-B1. Crystal structures reveal a conserved recognition mode between diverse HNV-G proteins and their distinct ephrin receptors and identify a region of molecular specificity within CedV-G that is a key determinant of ephrin selectivity. This work provides a platform for understanding the functional diversity and varied receptor tropism characteristics of HNV glycoproteins that will facilitate assessment of the pathogenic potential and transmissibility of newly discovered and uncharacterized HNVs.",

    "abstract": "Crocodylomorpha, which includes living crocodylians and their extinct relatives, has a rich fossil record, extending back for more than 200 million years. Unlike modern semi-aquatic crocodylians, extinct crocodylomorphs exhibited more varied lifestyles, ranging from marine to fully terrestrial forms. This ecological diversity was mirrored by a remarkable morphological disparity, particularly in terms of cranial morphology, which seems to be closely associated with ecological roles in the group. Here, I use geometric morphometrics to comprehensively investigate cranial shape variation and disparity in Crocodylomorpha. I quantitatively assess the relationship between cranial shape and ecology (i.e. terrestrial, aquatic, and semi-aquatic lifestyles), as well as possible allometric shape changes. I also characterise patterns of cranial shape evolution and identify regime shifts. I found a strong link between shape and size, and a significant influence of ecology on the observed shape variation. Terrestrial taxa, particularly notosuchians, have significantly higher disparity, and shifts to more longirostrine regimes are associated with large-bodied aquatic or semi-aquatic species. This demonstrates an intricate relationship between cranial shape, body size and lifestyle in crocodylomorph evolutionary history. Additionally, disparity-through-time analyses were highly sensitive to different phylogenetic hypotheses, suggesting the description of overall patterns among distinct trees. For crocodylomorphs, most results agree in an early peak during the Early Jurassic and another in the middle of the Cretaceous, followed by nearly continuous decline until today. Since only crown-group members survived through the Cenozoic, this decrease in disparity was likely the result of habitat loss, which narrowed down the range of crocodylomorph lifestyles.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Bio-electrochemical systems can generate electricity by virtue of mature microbial consortia that gradually and spontaneously optimize performance. To evaluate selective enrichment of these electrogenic microbial communities, five, 3-electrode reactors were inoculated with microbes derived from rice wash wastewater and incubated under a range of applied potentials. Reactors were sampled over a 12-week period and DNA extracted from anodal, cathodal, and planktonic bacterial communities was interrogated using a custom-made bioinformatics pipeline that combined 16S and metagenomic samples to monitor temporal changes in community composition. Some genera that constituted a minor proportion of the initial inoculum dominated within weeks following inoculation and correlated with applied potential. For instance, the abundance of Geobacter increased from 423-fold to 766-fold between -350 mV and -50 mV, respectively. Full metagenomic profiles of bacterial communities were obtained from reactors operating for 12 weeks. Functional analyses of metagenomes revealed metabolic changes between different species of the dominant genus, Geobacter, suggesting that optimal nutrient utilization at the lowest electrode potential is achieved via genome rearrangements and a strong inter-strain selection, as well as adjustment of the characteristic syntrophic relationships. These results reveal a certain degree of metabolic plasticity of electrochemically active bacteria and their communities in adaptation to adverse anodic and cathodic environments.",

    "abstract": "Paternal care is an evolutionary mystery. Despite extensive research, both theoretical and experimental, the reasons for its ubiquity remain unclear. Common explanations include kin selection and limited accuracy in parentage assessment. However, these explanations do not cover the breadth of circumstances in which paternal care has been observed, particularly in cases of uncertain paternity. Here we propose that microbes may play a key role in the evolution of paternal care among their hosts. Using computational models, we demonstrate that microbes associated with increased paternal care could be favoured by natural selection. We find that microbe-induced paternal care could evolve under wider conditions than suggested by genetic models. Moreover, we show that microbe-induced paternal care is more likely to evolve when considering paternal care interactions that increase microbial transmission, such as feeding and grooming. Our results imply that factors affecting the composition of host microbiome may also alter paternal behaviour.",

Conditional Crif1 deletion in bone marrow cells causes decreases in RANKL expression and the RANKL/OPG ratio, and relieves bone loss after radiation in mice. We further demonstrated in vitro that Crif1 promotes RANKL secretion via the cAMP/PKA pathway. Moreover, protein-protein docking screening identified five compounds as Crif1 inhibitors; these compounds dramatically suppressed RANKL secretion and CREB phosphorylation when cells were exposed to forskolin. This study enriches current knowledge of the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and provides insights into potential therapeutic strategies for osteoporosis treatment.",

At many genes, Pol II pauses stably in early elongation, remaining engaged with the 25-60 nucleotide-long nascent RNA for many minutes while awaiting signals for release into the gene body. However, a number of genes display highly unstable promoter Pol II, suggesting that paused polymerase might dissociate from template DNA at these promoters and release a short, non-productive mRNA. Here, we report that paused Pol II can be actively destabilized by the Integrator complex. Specifically, Integrator utilizes its RNA endonuclease activity to cleave nascent RNA and drive termination of paused Pol II.

    "abstract": "During meiosis, chromosomes adopt a specialized organization involving assembly of a cohesin-based axis along their lengths, with DNA loops emanating from this axis. We applied novel, quantitative and widely applicable cytogenetic strategies to elucidate the molecular bases of this organization using C. elegans. Analyses of WT chromosomes and de novo circular mini-chromosomes revealed that meiosis-specific HORMA-domain proteins assemble into cohorts in defined numbers and co-organize the axis together with two functionally-distinct cohesin complexes (REC-8 and COH-3/4) in defined stoichiometry. We further found that REC-8 cohesins, which load during S phase and mediate sister chromatid cohesion, usually occur as individual complexes, supporting a model wherein sister cohesion is mediated locally by a single cohesin ring. REC-8 complexes are interspersed in an alternating pattern with cohorts of axis-organizing COH-3/4 complexes (averaging three per cohort), which are insufficient to confer cohesion but can bind to individual chromatids, suggesting a mechanism to enable formation of asymmetric sister chromatid loops. Indeed, immuno-FISH assays demonstrate frequent asymmetry in genomic content between the loops formed on sister chromatids. We discuss how features of chromosome axis/loop architecture inferred from our data can help to explain enigmatic, yet essential, aspects of the meiotic program.",

Fungal spores, for example, remain quiescent for long periods until nourished, although the mechanisms by which dormancy is broken remain enigmatic. Transcriptome analysis could provide a clue, but methods to synchronously germinate large numbers of spores are lacking, and thus it remains a challenge to analyse gene expression upon germination. Hence, we developed methods to assemble transcriptomes from individual, asynchronous spore cells of fission yeast undergoing germination to assess transcriptomic changes over time. The virtual time-lapse analyses highlighted one of three copies of histone H3 genes for which transcription fluctuates during the initial stage of germination. Disruption of this temporal fluctuation caused defects in spore germination despite no visible defects in other stages of the life cycle. We conclude that modulation of histone H3 expression is a crucial  wake-up trigger at dormancy breaking.",

    "abstract": "Our previous work revealed that Nrf1 exerts a tumor-repressing effect because its genomic loss (to yield Nrf1-/-) results in oncogenic activation of Nrf2 and target genes. Interestingly, {beta}-catenin is concurrently activated by loss of Nrf1 in a way similar to {beta}-catenin-driven liver tumor. However, a presumable relationship between Nrf1 and {beta}-catenin is not as yet established. Here, we demonstrate that Nrf1 enhanced ubiquitination of {beta}-catenin for targeting to proteasomal degradation. Conversely, knockdown of Nrf1 by its short-hairpin RNA (shNrf1) caused accumulation of {beta}-catenin so as to translocate the nucleus, allowing activation of a subset of Wnt-{beta}-catenin signaling responsive genes, which leads to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and related cellular processes. Such silencing of Nrf1 resulted in malgrowth of human hepatocellular carcinoma, along with malignant invasion and metastasis to the lung and liver in xenograft model mice. Further transcriptomic sequencing unraveled significant differences in the expression of both Wnt/{beta}-catenin-dependent and -independent responsive genes implicated in the cell process, shape and behavior of the shNrf1-expressing tumor. Notably, we identified that {beta}-catenin is not a target gene of Nrf1, but this CNC-bZIP factor contributes to differential or opposing expression of other critical genes, such as CDH1, Wnt5A, Wnt11A, FZD10, LEF, TCF4, SMAD4, MMP9, PTEN, PI3K, JUN and p53, each of which depends on the positioning of distinct cis-regulatory sequences (e.g., ARE and/or AP-1 binding sites) in the gene promoter contexts. In addition, altered expression profiles of some Wnt-{beta}-catenin signaling proteins were context-dependent, as accompanied by decreased abundances of Nrf1 in the clinic human hepatomas with distinct differentiation. Together, these results corroborate the rationale that Nrf1 acts as a bona fide dominant tumor-repressor, by its intrinsic inhibition of Wnt-{beta}-catenin signaling and relevant independent networks in cancer development and malignant progression.",

    "abstract": "The Cyclin B:CDK1 kinase complex is the master regulator of mitosis that phosphorylates hundreds of proteins to coordinate mitotic progression. We show here that, in addition to these kinase functions, Cyclin B also scaffolds a localised signalling pathway to help preserve genome stability. Cyclin B1 localises to an expanded region of the outer kinetochore, known as the corona, where it scaffolds the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) machinery by binding directly to MAD1. In vitro reconstitutions map the key binding interface to a few acidic residues in the N-terminus of MAD1, and point mutations in this region remove corona MAD1 and weaken the SAC. Therefore, Cyclin B1 is the long-sought-after scaffold that links MAD1 to the corona and this specific pool of MAD1 is needed to generate a robust SAC response. Robustness, in this context, arises because Cyclin B1-MAD1 localisation becomes MPS1-independent after the corona has been established. We demonstrate that this allows corona-MAD1 to persist at kinetochores when MPS1 activity falls, ensuring that it can still be phosphorylated on a key C-terminal catalytic site by MPS1. Therefore, this study explains how corona MAD1 generates a robust SAC signal and why stripping of this pool by dynein is essential for SAC silencing. It also reveals that the key mitotic kinase, Cyclin B1-Cdk1, scaffolds the pathway that inhibits its own degradation.",

    "abstract": "Cell behavior is controlled through spatio-temporally localized protein activity. Despite unique and often contradictory roles played by Src-family-kinases (SFKs) in regulating cell physiology, activity patterns of individual SFKs have remained elusive. Here, we report a biosensor for specifically visualizing active conformation of SFK-Fyn in live cells. We deployed combinatorial library screening to isolate a binding-protein (F29) targeting activated Fyn. Nuclear-magnetic-resonance (NMR) analysis provides the structural basis of F29 specificity for Fyn over homologous SFKs. Using F29, we engineered a sensitive, minimally-perturbing fluorescence-resonance-energy-transfer (FRET) biosensor (FynSensor) that reveals cellular Fyn activity to be spatially localized, pulsatile and sensitive to adhesion/integrin signaling. Strikingly, growth factor stimulation further enhanced Fyn activity in pre-activated intracellular zones. However, inhibition of focal-adhesion-kinase activity not only attenuates Fyn activity, but abolishes growth-factor modulation. FynSensor imaging uncovers spatially-organized, sensitized signaling clusters, direct crosstalk between integrin and growth-factor-signaling, and clarifies how compartmentalized Src-kinase activity may drive cell fate.",

    "abstract": "Vertebrate cranial neural crest cells (CNCC) are multipotent. Proximal to the source CNCC form the cranial ganglia. Distally, in the pharyngeal arches, they give rise to the craniofacial skeleton and connective tissues. Fate choices are made as CNCC pattern into distinct destination compartments. In spite of this importance, the mechanism patterning CNCC is poorly defined. Here, we report that a novel {beta}-catenin-controlled switch in the cell arrangement is critical in patterning CNCC. In mouse embryos, at the first pharyngeal arch axial level, membrane {beta}-catenin levels correlate with the extent of cell-cell adhesion and thus, with a collective or a dispersed state of CNCC. Using in vitro human neural crest model and chemical modulators of {beta}-catenin levels, we show a requirement for down-modulating {beta}-catenin for the collective-to-dispersed switch. Similarly, in {beta}-catenin gain of function mutant mouse embryos, CNCC fail to disperse, which may underlie their failure to populate first pharyngeal arch. Thus, we show that {beta}-catenin-mediated regulation of CNCC tissue architecture, a previously underappreciated mechanism, underlies the patterning of CNCC into fate-specific compartments.\\n\\nSummary statementThe report shows a crucial step in cranial neural crest patterning. Neural crest cells invading the pharyngeal arches transition from a collective to a dispersed state. This transition in cell arrangement is dependent on membrane {beta}-catenin levels.",
