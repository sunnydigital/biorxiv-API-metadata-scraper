    "abstract": "Calcium ion concentration modulates the function of pyruvate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and -ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Previous studies have shown that despite its ability to affect the function of these dehydrogenases, [Ca2+] does not substantially alter mitochondrial ATP synthesis in vitro under physiological sub-strate conditions. We hypothesize that, rather than contributing to respiratory control, [Ca2+] governs fuel selection. Specifically, cardiac mitochondria are able to use different primary carbon substrates to synthesize ATP aerobically. To determine if and how [Ca2+] affects the relative use of carbohydrates versus fatty acids we measured oxygen consumption and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate concentrations in suspensions of cardiac mitochondria with different combinations of pyruvate and palmitoyl-L-carnitine in the media at various [Ca2+] and ADP infusion rates. Results reveal that when both fatty acid and carbohydrate substrates are available, fuel selection is sensitive to both calcium and ATP synthesis rate. When no Ca2+ is added under low ATP-demand conditions, {beta}-oxidation provides roughly half of acetyl-CoA for the citrate synthase reaction with the rest coming from the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction. Under low demand conditions with increasing [Ca2+], the fuel utilization ratio shifts to increased fractional consumption of pyruvate, with 83{+/-}10% of acetyl-CoA derived from pyruvate at the highest [Ca2+] evaluated. With high ATP demand, the majority of acetyl-CoA is derived from pyruvate, regardless of the Ca2+ level. Our results suggest that changes in work rate alone are enough to effect a switch to carbohydrate use while in vivo the rate at which this switch happens may depend on mitochondrial calcium.\\n\\nKey PointsO_LIDespite its effects on activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenases, Ca2+ does not substantially alter mitochondrial ATP synthesis in vitro under physiological substrate conditions.

    "abstract": "A key assumption of models of infectious disease is that population-scale spread is driven by transmission between host individuals at small scales. This assumption, however, is rarely tested, likely because observing disease transmission between host individuals is non-trivial in many infectious diseases. Quantifying the transmission of insect baculoviruses at a small scale is in contrast straightforward. We fit a disease model to data from baculovirus epizootics (= epidemics in animals) at the scale of whole forests, while using prior parameter distributions constructed from branch-scale experiments. Our experimentally-constrained model fits the large-scale data very well, supporting the role of small-scale transmission mechanisms in baculovirus epizootics. We further compared our experimentally-based model to an unconstrained model that ignores our experimental data, serving as a proxy for models that include large-scale mechanisms. This analysis supports our hypothesis that small-scale mechanisms are important, especially individual variability in host susceptibility to the virus. Comparison of transmission rates in the two models, however, suggests that large-scale mechanisms increase transmission compared to our experimental estimates. Our study shows that small-scale and large-scale mechanisms drive forest-wide epizootics of baculoviruses, and that synthesizing mathematical models with data collected across scales is key to understanding the spread of infectious disease.",

    "abstract": "PurposeTo identify therapeutic a bacteriophage that kills diarrheagenic enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) while leaving the human microbiome intact.\\n\\nMethodologyPhages from wastewater in Portland, OR, were screened for bacteriolytic activity using an overlay assay, and isolated in a sequential procedure to enrich for the recognition of core bacterial antigens. Electron microscopy and genome sequencing were performed to classify the isolated phage, and the host range was determined by spot tests and plaque assays. One-step growth curves and time-kill assays were conducted to characterize the life cycle of the phage, and to interrogate the multiplicity of infection (MOI) necessary for killing. A mouse model of infection was used to determine whether the phage could be used therapeutically against EAEC in vivo. Anaerobic culture in the presence of human fecal bacteria determined whether the phage could kill EAEC in vitro, and to assess whether the microbiome had been altered.\\n\\nResultsThe isolated phage, termed Escherichia virus PDX, is a member of the strictly lytic Myoviridae family of viruses. Phage PDX killed EAEC isolate EN1E-0227, a case-associated isolate from a child in rural Tennessee, in a dose-dependent manner, and also formed plaques on case-associated clinical EAEC isolates from Columbian children suffering from diarrhea. A single dose of PDX, at a MOI of 100, one day post infection, reduced the population of recovered EAEC isolate EN1E-0227 bacteria in fecal pellets in a mouse model of colonization, over a five-day period. Phage PDX also killed EAEC EN1E-0227 when cultured anaerobically in vitro in the presence of human fecal bacteria. While the addition of EAEC EN1E-0227 reduced the -diversity of the human microbiota, that of the cultures with either feces alone, feces with EAEC and PDX, or with just the PDX phage were not different statistically, as measured by Chao1 and Shannon diversity indices. Additionally, {beta}-diversity and differential abundance analyses show that conditions with PDX added were not different from feces alone, but all groups were significantly different from feces + EAEC.\\n\\nConclusionsThe strictly bacteriolytic, Myoviridae Escherichia virus PDX killed EAEC isolate EN1E-0227 bacteria both in vivo and in vitro, while simultaneously not altering the diversity of normal human microbiota in anaerobic culture. Thus, the PDX phage could be part of an effective therapeutic intervention for children in developing countries who suffer from acute, or persistent EAEC-mediated diarrhea, and to help reduce the serious effects of environmental enteropathy. Because the emerging pathogen EAEC is now the second leading cause of travelers diarrhea, PDX could also provide therapeutic relief for these individuals, particularly in light of the growing crisis of antibiotic resistances.",

    "abstract": "Many models of classical conditioning fail to describe important phenomena, notably the rapid return of fear after extinction. To address this shortfall, evidence converged on the idea that learning agents rely on latent-state inferences, i.e. an ability to index disparate associations from cues to rewards (or penalties) and infer which index (i.e. latent state) is presently active. Our goal was to develop a model of latent-state inferences that uses latent states to predict rewards from cues efficiently and that can describe behavior in a diverse set of experiments. The resulting model combines a Rescorla-Wagner rule, for which updates to associations are proportional to prediction error, with an approximate Bayesian rule, for which beliefs in latent states are proportional to prior beliefs and an approximate likelihood based on current associations. In simulation, we demonstrate the models ability to reproduce learning effects both famously explained and not explained by the Rescorla-Wagner model, including rapid return of fear after extinction, the Hall-Pearce effect, partial reinforcement extinction effect, backwards blocking, and memory modification. Lastly, we derive our model as an online algorithm to maximum likelihood estimation, demonstrating it is an efficient approach to outcome prediction. Establishing such a framework is a key step towards quantifying normative and pathological ranges of latent-state inferences in various contexts.\\n\\nAuthor summaryComputational researchers are increasingly interested in a structured form of learning known as latent-state inferences. Latent-state inferences is a type of learning that involves categorizing, generalizing, and recalling disparate associations between observations in ones environment and is used in situations when the correct association is latent or unknown. This type of learning has been used to explain overgeneralization of a fear memory and the cognitive role of certain brain regions important to cognitive neuroscience and psychiatry. Accordingly, latent-state inferences are an important area of inquiry. Through simulation and theory, we establish a new model of latent-state inferences. Moving forward, we aim to use this framework to measure latent-state inferences in healthy and psychiatric populations.",

    "abstract": "The temporal and spatial neural processing of faces have been studied rigorously, but few studies have unified these dimensions to reveal the spatio-temporal dynamics postulated by the models of face processing. We used support vector machine decoding and representational similarity analysis to combine information from different locations (fMRI), timepoints (EEG), and theoretical models. By correlating information matrices derived from pair-wise decodings of neural responses to different facial expressions (neutral, happy, fearful, angry), we found early EEG timepoints (110-150 ms) to match fMRI data from early visual cortex (EVC), and later timepoints (170 - 250 ms) to match data from occipital and fusiform face areas (OFA/FFA) and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). The earliest correlations were driven by information from happy faces, and the later by more accurate decoding of fearful and angry faces. Model comparisons revealed systematic changes along the processing hierarchy, from emotional distance and visual feature coding in EVC to coding of intensity of expressions in right pSTS. The results highlight the importance of multimodal approach for understanding functional roles of different brain regions.",

    "abstract": "Hyperinsulinemia is commonly viewed as a compensatory response to insulin resistance, yet studies have suggested that chronically elevated insulin may also drive insulin resistance. The molecular mechanisms underpinning this potentially cyclic process remain poorly defined, especially on a transcriptome-wide level. To study the direct effects of prolonged exposure to excess insulin in muscle cells, we incubated C2C12 myotubes with elevated insulin for 16 hours, followed by 6 hours of serum starvation, and established that acute AKT and ERK signaling were attenuated in this model of in vitro hyperinsulinemia. Global RNA-sequencing of cells both before and after nutrient withdrawal highlighted genes in the insulin signaling, FOXO signaling, and glucose metabolism pathways indicative of  hyperinsulinemia and  starvation programs. We observed that hyperinsulinemia led to a substantial reduction in insulin receptor (Insr) gene expression, and subsequently a reduced surface INSR and total INSR protein, both in vitro and in vivo. Transcriptomic meta-analysis in >450 human samples demonstrated that fasting insulin reliably and negatively correlated with insulin receptor (INSR) mRNA in skeletal muscle. Bioinformatic modeling combined with RNAi, identified SIN3A as a negative regulator of Insr mRNA (and JUND, MAX, and MXI as positive regulators of Irs2 mRNA). Together, our analysis identifies novel mechanisms which may explain the cyclic processes underlying hyperinsulinemia-induced insulin resistance in muscle, a process directly relevant to the etiology and disease progression of type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "As the use of functional trait approaches is growing in fungal ecology, there is a corresponding need to understand trait variation. Much of trait theory and statistical techniques are built on the assumption that interspecific variation is larger than intraspecific variation. This allows the use of mean trait values for species, which the vast majority of trait studies adopt. We examined the size of intra- vs. inter-specific variation in two wood fungal fruit body traits: size and density. Both coefficients of variation (CV) and Trait Probability Density analyses were used to quantify trait variation. We found that intraspecific variation in fruit body density was more than twice as variable as interspecific variation, and fruit body size was hugely variable (CVs averaged 190%), although interspecific variation was larger. Further, there was a very high degree of overlap in the trait space of species, indicating that there may be little niche partitioning at the species level. These findings show that intraspecific variation is highly important and should be accounted for when using trait approaches to understand fungal ecology. More data on variation of other fungal traits is also desperately needed to ascertain whether the high level of variation found here is typical for fungi. While the need to measure individuals does reduce the ability to generalise at the species level, it does not negate the usefulness of fungal trait measurements. There are two reasons for this: first, the ecology of most fungal species remains poorly known and trait measurements address this gap; and secondly, if trait overlap between species more generally is as much as we found here, then individual measurements may be more helpful than species identity for untangling fungal community dynamics.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMicrobiome research is providing important new insights into the metabolic interactions of complex microbial ecosystems involved in fields as diverse as the pathogenesis of human diseases, agriculture and climate change. Poor correlations typically observed between RNA and protein expression datasets make it hard to accurately infer microbial protein synthesis from metagenomic data. Additionally, mass spectrometry-based metaproteomic analyses typically rely on focussed search libraries based on prior knowledge for protein identification that may not represent all the proteins present in a set of samples. Metagenomic 16S rRNA sequencing will only target the bacterial component, while whole genome sequencing is at best an indirect measure of expressed proteomes. We describe a novel approach, MetaNovo, that combines existing open-source software tools to perform scalable de novo sequence tag matching with a novel algorithm for probabilistic optimization of the entire UniProt knowledgebase to create tailored databases for target-decoy searches directly at the proteome level, enabling analyses without prior expectation of sample composition or metagenomic data generation, and compatible with standard downstream analysis pipelines.\n\nResultsWe compared MetaNovo to published results from the MetaPro-IQ pipeline on 8 human mucosal-luminal interface samples, with comparable numbers of peptide and protein identifications, many shared peptide sequences and a similar bacterial taxonomic distribution compared to that found using a matched metagenome database - but simultaneously identified many more non-bacterial peptides than the previous approaches. MetaNovo was also benchmarked on samples of known microbial composition against matched metagenomic and whole genomic database workflows, yielding many more MS/MS identifications for the expected taxa, with improved taxonomic representation, while also highlighting previously described genome sequencing quality concerns for one of the organisms, and identifying a known sample contaminant without prior expectation.\n\nConclusionsBy estimating taxonomic and peptide level information directly on microbiome samples from tandem mass spectrometry data, MetaNovo enables the simultaneous identification of peptides from all domains of life in metaproteome samples, bypassing the need for curated sequence search databases. We show that the MetaNovo approach to mass spectrometry metaproteomics is more accurate than current gold standard approaches of tailored or matched genomic database searches, can identify sample contaminants without prior expectation and yields insights into previously unidentified metaproteomic signals, building on the potential for complex mass spectrometry metaproteomic data to speak for itself.

Our results show that a subsequent DENV infection in animals with early- and middle-convalescent periods to ZIKV do not promote an increase in DENV viremia nor pro-inflammatory status. Previous ZIKV exposure increases the magnitude of the antibody and T cell responses against DENV, and different time intervals between infections alter the magnitude and durability of such responses--more after longer ZIKV pre-exposure.

Here I simulate secondary contact between two populations ( species) to examine effects of pre- and postzygotic isolation in preventing blending. A small reduction in hybrid fitness (e.g., 10%) produces a narrower hybrid zone than a strong but imperfect mating preference (e.g., 10x stronger preference for conspecific over heterospecific mates). This is because, in the latter case, rare F1 hybrids find each other attractive (due to assortative mating), leading to the gradual buildup of a full continuum of intermediates between the two species. The cline is narrower than would result from purely neutral diffusion over the same number of generations, largely due to the frequency-dependent mating disadvantage of individuals of rare mating types. Hybrids tend to pay this cost of rarity more than pure individuals, meaning there is an induced postzygotic isolation effect of assortative mating. These results prompt a questioning of the concept of partial prezygotic isolation, since it is not very isolating unless there is also postzygotic isolation.",

This synergy between language and extralinguistic cognition is pivotal to language comprehension in general, but especially prominent in demonstratives.\\n\\nIn this study, we aimed to elucidate which neural architectures enable this intertwining between language and extralinguistic cognition using a naturalistic fMRI paradigm. In our experiment, 28 participants listened to a specially crafted dialogical narrative with a controlled number of spatial demonstratives. A fast multiband-EPI acquisition sequence (TR = 388ms) combined with finite impulse response (FIR) modelling of the hemodynamic response was used to capture signal changes at word-level resolution.\\n\\nWe found that spatial demonstratives bilaterally engage a network of parietal areas, including the supramarginal gyrus, the angular gyrus, and precuneus, implicated in information integration and visuospatial processing. Moreover, demonstratives recruit frontal regions, including the right FEF, implicated in attentional orienting and reference frames shifts. Finally, using multivariate similarity analyses, we provide evidence for a general involvement of the dorsal (\\\"where\\\") stream in the processing of spatial expressions, as opposed to ventral pathways encoding object semantics.\\n\\nOverall, our results suggest that language processing relies on a distributed architecture, recruiting neural resources for perception, attention, and extra-linguistic aspects of cognition in a dynamic and context-dependent fashion.",

    "abstract": "Life expectancy and obesity rates have drastically increased in recent years. An unhealthy weight is related to long-lasting biological deregulations that might compromise the normal course of aging. The aim of the current study was to test whether the network composition of young adults with obesity would show signs of premature aging. To this end, subjects with obesity (N = 30, mean age 32.8 {+/-} 5.68), healthy-weight controls (N = 33, mean age 30.9 {+/-} 6.24) as well as non-demented seniors (N = 30, mean age 67.1 {+/-} 6.65) all underwent a resting-state MRI acquisition. Functional connectivity was studied by means of graph-theory measurements (i.e., small-world index, clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, and mean degree). Contrary to what expected, obesity in adults was related to disruptions in small-world properties driven by increases in network segregation (i.e., clustering coefficient) as compared to elders. Also, this group showed alterations in global and regional centrality metrics (i.e., degree) relative to controls and seniors. Despite not mimicking what was here shown by seniors, the topological organization linked to an obesity status may represent a flaw for cognitive functions depending on the rapid combination between different modular communities.",

    "abstract": "Ancient environmental DNA has been established as a viable biomolecular proxy for tracking taxonomic presence through time in a local environment, even in the total absence of primary tissues. It is thought that sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) survives through mineral binding. And while these organo-mineral complexes likely facilitate long-term preservation, they also challenge our ability to release and isolate target molecules. Two limitations in sedaDNA extraction impede many palaeoenvironmental reconstructions: the post-extraction carryover of enzymatic inhibitors, and sedaDNA loss when attempting to reduce inhibitor co-elution. Here, we present an optimised eDNA targeted enrichment approach for reconstructing past environments. Our new extraction protocol with targeted enrichment averages a 14.6-fold increase in on-target plant and animal DNA compared to a commercial soil extraction kit, and a 22.6-fold increase compared to a PCR metabarcoding approach. To illustrate the effectiveness of the PalaeoChip Arctic1.0 protocol, we present results of plant and animal presence from permafrost samples and discuss new potential evidence for the late survival (ca. 9685 BP) of mammoth (Mammuthus sp.) and horse (Equus sp.) in the Klondike Region of Yukon, Canada.

    "abstract": "Oxford Nanopore sequencing of DNA molecules is fast gaining popularity for generating longer reads, albeit with higher error rates, in much lesser time, and without the error introduced by PCR-amplification. Recently, CRISPR-Cas9 has been used to enrich genomic regions (nCATS [1]). This was applied on 10 genomic loci (median length=18kb). Here, using the sequencing data (Accid:PRJNA531320), it is shown that the same flow can be used to identify CRISPR-Cas9 off-target edits (OTE). OTEs are an important, but unfortunately underestimated, aspect of CRISPR-Cas gene-editing. An OTE in the mitochondrial genome is shown having 7 mismatches with one of the 10 gRNAs used (GPX1), having as much enrichment as the targeted genomic loci in some samples. Previous study has shown that Cas9 bind to off-targets having as many as 10 mismatches in the PAM-distal region. This OTE has not been reported in the original study (still a pre-print), which states that sequences from parts other than the target locations arise  from ligation of nanopore adaptors to random breakage points, with no clear evidence of off-target cleavage by Cas9 [1], Furthermore, a lot of reads aligning to the mitochondrial genome (sometimes full length) are inverted after the edit. It remains to be seen if these are bona fide translocations after the Cas9 edit, or ONP sequencing artifacts. This also raises the question whether the mitochondrial genome is more prone to off-targets by virtue of being non-nuclear. Another locus in ChrX (13121412) has only 1 mismatch with the second BRAF gRNA (GACCAAGGATTTCGTGGTGA). Although the number of reads for this OTE is less, its very unlikely this is random since it happens 8 out of 11 samples. With the increasing use of (TALEN/ZFN/CRISPR-Cas9) on human subjects, this provides a fast method to quickly query gRNAs for off-targets in cells obtained from the patient, which will have their own unique off-targets due to single nucleotide polymorphism or other variants.",

Although there is still no clear main function of circRNAs, several studies have revealed that circRNAs are expressed in a variety of eukaryotic organisms, demonstrate conservation across species, and are expressed in a regulated manner often independent of their parental linear isoforms. circNFATC3, an abundant and uncharacterized circular isoform of NFATC3 gene (which is formed form backsplicing of exon 2 and 3) in solid tumors was identified from transcriptomic data. Here we show that circNFATC3 gain of and loss of function experiments using RNAi mediated circRNA silencing and circular mini vector-mediated overexpression of circularized constructs in breast and ovarian cancer cell lines affects molecular phenotypes. Knockdown of circNFATC3 induces a reduction in cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and oxidative phosphorylation. Gain of function of circNFATc3 in MDA-MB -231 cells and SKOV3 cells shows a significant increase in cell proliferation, migration, and respiration. The above results suggest that circNFATC3 is a functionally relevant circular RNA in cancer",

    "abstract": "Domestication dramatically alters phenotypes. Standing variation among ancestral populations often drives phenotypic change during domestication, but some changes are caused by novel mutations. Dogs (Canis familiaris) engage in interspecific play with humans and it has specifically been suggested that the ability to interpret social-communicative behaviour expressed by humans is a novel dog-specific skill. Thus, wolves (Canis lupus) are not expected to engage in interspecific play with a human based on social-communicative cues. Here we report the observation of three eight week-old wolf puppies spontaneously responding to social-communicative behaviours from a stranger by retrieving a ball. This unexpected and novel observation has significant implications for our understanding and expectations of the genetic foundations of dog behaviour. Importantly, our observations indicate that behavioural responses to human social-communicative cues are not unique to dogs. This suggests that, while probably rare, standing variation in the expression of human-directed behaviour in ancestral populations could have been an important target for early selective pressures exerted during dog domestication.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety and stress-related disorders are highly prevalent and debilitating conditions that impose an enormous burden on society. Sensitive measurements that can enable early diagnosis could mitigate suffering and potentially prevent onset of these conditions. Self-reports, however, are intrusive and vulnerable to biases that can conceal the true internal state. Physiological responses, on the other hand, manifest spontaneously and can be monitored continuously, providing potential objective biomarkers for anxiety and stress. Recent studies have shown that algorithms trained on physiological measurements can predict stress states with high accuracy. Whether these predictive algorithms generalize to untested situations and participants, however, remains unclear. Further, whether biomarkers of momentary stress indicate trait anxiety - a vulnerability foreshadowing development of anxiety and mood disorders - remains unknown. To address these gaps, we monitored skin conductance, heart rate, heart rate variability and EEG in 39 participants experiencing physical and social stress and compared these measures to non-stressful periods of talking, rest, and playing a simple video game. Self-report measures were obtained periodically throughout the experiment. A support vector machine trained on physiological measurements identified stress conditions with ~96% accuracy. A decision tree that optimally combined physiological and self-report measures identified individuals with high trait anxiety with ~84% accuracy. Individuals with high trait anxiety also displayed high baseline state anxiety but a muted physiological response to acute stressors. Overall, these results demonstrate the potential for using machine learning tools to identify objective biomarkers useful for diagnosing and monitoring mental health conditions like anxiety and depression.",

    "abstract": "Skin cancer is a crucial public health issue and by far the most usual kind of cancer specifically in the region of North America. It is estimated that in 2019, only because of melanoma nearly 7,230 people will die, and 192,310 cases of malignant melanoma will be diagnosed. Nonetheless, nearly all types of skin lesions can be treatable if they can be diagnosed at an earlier stage. The accurate prediction of skin lesions is a critically challenging task even for vastly experienced clinicians and dermatologist due to a little distinction between surrounding skin and lesions, visual resemblance between melanoma and other skin lesions, fuddled lesion border, etc. A well-grounded automated computer-aided skin lesions detection system can help clinicians immensely to prognosis malignant skin lesion in the earliest possible time. From the past few years, the emergence of machine learning and deep learning in the medical imaging has produced several image-based classification systems in the medical field and these systems perform better than traditional image processing classification methods. In this paper, we proposed a popular deep learning technique namely atrous or, dilated convolution for skin lesions classification, which is known to have enhanced accuracy with the same amount of computational cost compared to traditional CNN. To implement atrous convolution we choose the transfer learning technique with several popular deep learning architectures such as VGG16, VGG19, MobileNet, and InceptionV3. To train, validate, and test our proposed models we utilize HAM10000 dataset which contains total 10015 dermoscopic images of seven different skin lesions (melanoma, melanocytic nevi, Basal cell carcinoma, Benign keratosis-like lesions, Dermatofibroma, Vascular lesions, and Actinic keratoses). Four of our proposed dilated convolutional frameworks show promising outcome on overall accuracy and per-class accuracy. For example, overall test accuracy achieved 87.42%, 85.02%, 88.22%, and 89.81% on dilated VGG16, dilated VGG19, dilated MobileNet, and dilated IncaptionV3 respectively. These dilated convolutional models outperformed existing networks in both overall accuracy and individual class accuracy. Among all the architectures dilated InceptionV3 shows superior classification accuracy and dilated MobileNet is also achieving almost impressive classification accuracy like dilated InceptionV3 with the lightest computational complexities than all other proposed model. Compared to previous works done on skin lesions classification we have experimented one of the most complicated open-source datasets with class imbalances and achieved better accuracy (dilated inceptionv3) than any known methods to the best of our knowledge.",

While NF-1 is often characterized by cafe-au-lait skin spots and benign tumors, the mechanisms underlying cognitive changes in NF-1 are poorly understood. Cortical GABAergic interneurons (CINs) are implicated in NF-1 pathology but cellular and molecular changes to CINs are poorly understood. We deleted Nf1 from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), which gives rise to both oligodendrocytes and CINs that express somatostatin and parvalbumin. Loss of Nf1 led to a persistence of immature oligodendrocytes that prevented later born oligodendrocytes from occupying the cortex. Moreover, PV+ CINs were uniquely lost, without changes in SST+ CINs. We discovered that loss of Nf1 results in a graded decrease in Lhx6 expression, the transcription factor necessary to establish SST+ and PV+ CINs, revealing a mechanism whereby Nf1 regulates a critical CIN developmental milestone.",

    "abstract": "NMDA receptors (NMDAR) are key players in the initiation of synaptic plasticity that underlies learning and memory. Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synapses require an increased calcium current via NMDA channels to trigger modifications in postsynaptic density (PSD). It is generally believed that the amount of NMDARs on the postsynaptic surface remains stationary, whereas their subunit composition is dynamically fluctuated during this plasticity process. However, the molecular machinery underlying this subunit-specific regulation remains largely elusive. Here, by detecting the time-lapse changes of surface GluN2A and GluN2B subunit levels using biochemical approaches, surface immunostaining, live-imaging and super-resolution microscopy, we uncovered a transient increase of surface GluN2A-type NMDARs shortly after the induction of chemical long term potentiation (cLTP). These augmented sub-diffraction-limited GluN2A clusters predominantly exist in extrasynaptic domains. We also showed that the spine-enriched SNARE associated protein SNAP-23, and to a minor extent its homologue SNAP-25, control both the basal and regulated surface level of GluN2A receptors. Using a total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) based live-imaging assay, we resolved and analyzed individual exocytic events of NMDARs in live neurons and found that cLTP raised the frequency of NMDAR exocytosis at extrasynaptic regions, without altering the duration or the package size of these events. Our study thereby provides direct evidence that synaptic plasticity controls the postsynaptic exocytosis machinery, which induces the insertion of more GluN2A receptors into the extrasynaptic area.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMemory formation involves the long-term modification of synapses, which is called synaptic plasticity. In the postsynaptic density (PSD) of excited neurons, this modification process occurs on a minute timescale, initiated by the opening of NMDARs that trigger downstream cascades to fix the potentiation (LTP) at specific synapses for longer timescales. Here, using a novel live-imaging assay we resolved the dynamic delivery of NMDARs to the cell surface, and found that only the insertion frequency, not the duration of individual insertion or number of GluN2A subunits each of these NMDAR vesicles contains, was altered during the synaptic potentiation process. We also identified SNAP-23 as the key molecule mediating this activity dependent NMDAR surface delivery. This study provides a novel mechanism of how NMDARs are regulated in the short window to initiate the long-lasting synaptic modifications.",

    "abstract": "Standardised Type IIS DNA assembly methods are becoming essential for biological engineering and research. Although a  common syntax has been proposed to enable higher interoperability between DNA libraries, Golden Gate (GG)-based assembly systems remain specific to target organisms. Furthermore, these GG assembly systems become laborious and unnecessarily complicated beyond the assembly of 4 transcriptional units. Here, we describe \\\"universal Loop\\\" (uLoop) assembly, a simple system based on Loop assembly that enables hierarchical fabrication of large DNA constructs (> 30 kb) for any organism of choice. uLoop comprises two sets of four plasmids that are iteratively used as odd and even levels to compile DNA elements in an exponential manner (4n-1). The elements required for transformation/maintenance in target organisms are also assembled as standardised parts, enabling customisation of host-specific plasmids. Thus, this species-agnostic method decouples efficiency of assembly from the stability of vectors in the target organism. As a proof-of-concept, we show the engineering of multi-gene expression vectors in diatoms, yeast, plants and bacteria.

    "abstract": "Motivational states are important determinants of behavior. In Drosophila melanogaster, courtship behavior is robust and crucial for species continuation. However, the motivation of courtship behavior remains unexplored. We first find the phenomenon that courtship behavior is modulated by motivational state. A male fly courts another male fly when it first courts a decapitated female fly however, male- male courtship behavior rarely occurs under normal conditions. Male flies that have satisfied the need for sexual behavior show a decreased male-female sex drive. Therefore, in this phenomenon, the male flys courtship motivational state is induced by its exposure to female flies. Blocking dopaminergic neurons by expressing TNTe decreases motivational state-induced male-male courtship behavior without affecting male-female courtship behavior. Vision cues are another key component in sexually driven male-female courtship behavior. Here, we identify a base theory that the inner motivational state could eventually decide fly behavior.",

    "abstract": "Elevated amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression in the choroid plexus suggests an important role for extracellular APP metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid. Despite widespread App brain expression, we hypothesized that specifically targeting choroid plexus expression could alter animal physiology. Through various genetic and viral approaches in the adult mouse, we show that choroid plexus APP levels significantly impacted proliferation in both subventricular zone and hippocampus dentate gyrus neurogenic niches. Given the role of A{beta} peptides in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis, we also tested whether favoring the production of A{beta} in choroid plexus could negatively affect niche functions. After AAV5-mediated long-term expression of human mutated APP specifically in the choroid plexus of adult wild type mice, we observe reduced niche proliferation, behavioral defects in reversal learning, and deficits in hippocampal long-term potentiation. Our findings highlight the unique role played by the choroid plexus in regulating brain function, and suggest that targeting APP in choroid plexus may provide a means to improve hippocampus function and alleviate disease-related burdens.",

    "abstract": "While neurogenesis in the adult hypothalamus is now known to be essential for proper function, the cell-cell signaling events that regulate neurogenesis in this evolutionarily conserved brain region remain poorly understood. Here we show that Hedgehog (Hh)/Gli signaling positively regulates hypothalamic neurogenesis in both larval and adult zebrafish and is necessary and sufficient for normal hypothalamic proliferation rates. Hedgehog-responsive cells are relatively rapidly proliferating pluripotent neural precursors that give rise to dopaminergic, serotonergic, and GABAergic neurons. in situ and transgenic reporter analyses revealed substantial heterogeneity in cell-cell signaling within the hypothalamic niche, with slow cycling Nestin-expressing cells residing among distinct and overlapping populations of Sonic Hh (Shh)-expressing, Hh-responsive, Notch-responsive, and Wnt-responsive radial glia. This work shows for the first time that Hh/Gli-signaling is a key component of the complex cell-cell signaling environment that regulates hypothalamic neurogenesis throughout life.",

    "abstract": "Members of the GATA family of transcription factors play key roles in the differentiation of specific cell lineages by regulating the expression of target genes. Three GATA factors play distinct roles in hematopoietic differentiation. In order to better understand how these GATA factors function to regulate genes throughout the genome, we are studying the epigenomic and transcriptional landscapes of hematopoietic cells in a model-driven, integrative fashion. We have formed the collaborative multi-lab VISION project to conduct ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of epigenomic data in mouse and human hematopoiesis. The epigenomic data included nuclease accessibility in chromatin, CTCF occupancy, and histone H3 modifications for twenty cell types covering hematopoietic stem cells, multilineage progenitor cells, and mature cells across the blood cell lineages of mouse. The analysis used the Integrative and Discriminative Epigenome Annotation System (IDEAS), which learns all common combinations of features (epigenetic states) simultaneously in two dimensions - along chromosomes and across cell types. The result is a segmentation that effectively paints the regulatory landscape in readily interpretable views, revealing constitutively active or silent loci as well as the loci specifically induced or repressed in each stage and lineage. Nuclease accessible DNA segments in active chromatin states were designated candidate cis-regulatory elements in each cell type, providing one of the most comprehensive registries of candidate hematopoietic regulatory elements to date. Applications of VISION resources are illustrated for regulation of genes encoding GATA1, GATA2, GATA3, and Ikaros. VISION resources are freely available from our website http://usevision.org.",

    "abstract": "Despite collectively accounting for 25% of tumors in U.S. adults, rare cancers have significant unmet clinical needs as they are difficult to study due to low incidence and geographically dispersed patient populations. We sought to assess whether a patient-partnered research approach using online engagement can overcome these challenges and accelerate scientific discovery in rare cancers, focusing on angiosarcoma (AS), an exceedingly rare sarcoma with a dismal prognosis and an annual U.S. incidence of 300 cases. Here, we describe the development of the Angiosarcoma Project (ASCproject), an initiative enabling patients across the U.S. and Canada to remotely share their clinical information and biospecimens for research. The project generates and publicly releases clinically annotated genomic data on tumor and germline specimens on an ongoing basis. Over 18 months, 338 AS patients registered for the ASCproject, comprising a significant fraction of all patients. Whole exome sequencing of 47 AS tumors revealed several recurrently mutated genes, including KDR, TP53, and PIK3CA. Activating mutations in PIK3CA were observed nearly exclusively in primary breast AS, suggesting a therapeutic rationale in these patients. AS of the head, neck, face, and scalp (HNFS) was associated with high tumor mutation burden and a dominant mutational signature of UV light exposure, suggesting that UV damage may be a causative factor in HNFS AS and that this AS subset might be amenable to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Medical record review revealed two patients with HNFS AS received off-label treatment with anti-PD-1 therapy and experienced exceptional responses, highlighting immune checkpoint inhibition as a therapeutic avenue for HNFS AS. This patient-partnered approach has catalyzed an opportunity to discover the etiology and potential therapies for AS patients. Collectively, this proof of concept study demonstrates that empowering patients to directly participate in research can overcome barriers in rare diseases and enable biological and clinical discoveries.",

    "abstract": "Type II CRISPR-Cas systems provide immunity against phages and plasmids that infect bacteria. Following infection, a short sequence of the phage genome known as the \\\"spacer\\\" is inserted into the CRISPR locus to capture a memory of the infection and immunize the host. Spacers are transcribed and processed into guide RNAs that direct the Cas9 nuclease to its target on the invader. Thousands of spacers are acquired to target the viral genome at multiple locations and neutralize phage mutants that evade the immunity specified by a single guide RNA. In liquid cultures, where phages and their hosts are constantly mixed, spacer diversity is generated at the population level, and a single immunization per cell is sufficient to confer robust immunity. Although rare, bacteria that acquire multiple spacers can also be found, demonstrating that type II CRISPR-Cas systems also have the capability of generating spacer diversity at the cellular level. However, conditions in which this feature is important for survival are poorly understood. Here we found that when phage infections occur on solid media, a high proportion of the surviving colonies display sectored morphologies that contain individual cells with multiple spacers. We show that this is the result of the bacteria-host co-evolution, in which the immunity provided by the initial acquired spacer is easily overcome by escaper phages that decimate all the progeny of the founder cell that do not acquire additional spacers. Our results reveal the versatility of type II CRISPR-Cas immunity, which can respond with both single or multiple spacer acquisition schemes to solve challenges presented by different environments.",

    "abstract": "The R7 and R8 photoreceptor cells of the Drosophila compound eye mediate color vision. Throughout the majority of the eye, these cells occur in two principal types of ommatidia. Approximately 35% of ommatidia are of the pale type and express Rh3 in R7 cells and Rh5 in R8 cells. The remaining 65% are of the yellow type and express Rh4 in R7 cells and Rh6 in R8 cells. The specification of an R8 cell in a pale or yellow ommatidium depends on the fate of the adjacent R7 cell. However, pale and yellow R7 cells are specified by a stochastic process that requires the genes spineless, tango and klumpfuss. To identify additional genes involved in this process we performed a genetic screen using a collection of 480 P{EP} transposon insertion strains. We identified genes that when inactivated and/or ectopically expressed in R7 cells resulted in a significantly altered percentage of Rh3 expressing R7 cells (Rh3%) from wild-type. 53 strains resulted in altered Rh3% in the heterozygous inactivation arm of the screen. 36 strains resulted in altered Rh3% in the ectopic expression arm of the screen, where the P{EP} insertion strains were crossed to a sevEP-GAL4 driver line. 4 strains showed differential effects between the two screens. Analyses of these results suggest that R7 cell fate specification is sensitive to perturbations in transcription, growth inhibition, glycoprotein ligand binding, WNT signaling, ubiquitin protease activity and Ser/Thr kinase activity, among other diverse signaling and cell biological processes.",
