    "abstract": "Many studies exclude loci exhibiting linkage disequilibrium (LD); however, high LD can signal reduced recombination around genomic features such as chromosome inversions or sex-determining regions. Chromosome inversions and sex-determining regions are often involved in adaptation, allowing for the inheritance of co-adapted gene complexes and for the resolution of sexually antagonistic selection through sex-specific partitioning of genetic variants. Genomic features such as these can escape detection when loci with LD are removed; in addition, failing to account for these features can introduce bias to analyses. We examined patterns of LD using network analysis to identify an overlapping chromosome inversion and sex-determining region in chum salmon. The signal of the inversion was strong enough to show up as false population substructure when the entire dataset was analyzed, while the signal of the sex-determining region was only obvious after restricting genetic analysis to the sex chromosome. Understanding the extent and geographic distribution of inversions is now a critically important part of genetic analyses of natural populations. The results of this study highlight the importance of analyzing and understanding patterns of LD in genomic dataset and the perils of ignoring or excluding loci exhibiting LD.",

    "abstract": "The carboxysome is a bacterial micro-compartment (BMC) subtype that encapsulates enzymatic activities necessary for carbon fixation. Carboxysome shells are composed of a relatively complex cocktail of proteins, their precise number and identity being species dependent. Shell components can be classified in two structural families, the most abundant class associating as hexamers (BMC-H) that are supposed to be major players for regulating shell permeability. Up to recently, these proteins were proposed to associate as homo-oligomers. Genomic data, however, demonstrated the existence of paralogs coding for multiple shell subunits. Here, we studied cross-association compatibilities among BMC-H CcmK proteins of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. Co-expression in Escherichia coli proved a consistent formation of hetero-hexamers combining CcmK1 and CcmK2 or, remarkably, CcmK3 and CcmK4 subunits. Unlike CcmK1/K2 hetero-hexamers, the stoichiometry of incorporation of CcmK3 in associations with CcmK4 was low. Cross-interactions implicating other combinations were weak, highlighting a structural segregation of the two groups that could relate to gene organization. Sequence analysis and structural models permitted to localize interactions that would favor formation of CcmK3/K4 hetero-hexamers. Attempts to crystallize these CcmK3/K4 associations conducted to the unambiguous elucidation of a CcmK4 homo-hexamer structure. Yet, subunit exchange could not be demonstrated in vitro. Biophysical measurements showed that hetero-hexamers are thermally less stable than homo-hexamers, and impeded in forming larger assemblies. These novel findings are discussed in frame with reported data to propose a functional scenario in which minor CcmK3/K4 incorporation in shells would introduce sufficient local disorder as to allow shell remodeling necessary to adapt rapidly to environmental changes.",

    "abstract": "The relationship of genotypes to phenotypes can be modified by environmental inputs. Such crucial environmental inputs include metabolic cues derived from microbes living together with animals. Thus the analysis of genetic effects on animals physiology can be confounded by variations in the metabolic profile of microbes. Caenorhabditis elegans exposed to distinct bacterial strains and species exhibit phenotypes different at cellular, developmental and behavioral levels. Here we reported metabolomic profiles of three Escherichia coli strains, B strain OP50, K-12 strain MG1655, and B-K-12 hybrid strain HB101, and also different mitochondrial and fat storage phenotypes of C. elegans exposed to MG1655 and HB101 versus OP50. We found that these metabolic phenotypes of C. elegans are not correlated with overall metabolic patterning of bacterial strains, but their specific metabolites. In particular, the fat storage phenotype is traced to the betaine level in different bacterial strains. HT115 is another K-12 E. coli strain that is commonly utilized to elicit an RNA interference response, and we showed that C. elegans exposed to OP50 and HT115 exhibit differences in mitochondrial morphology and fat storage levels. We thus generated an RNA interference competent OP50 (iOP50) strain that can robustly and consistently knockdown endogenous C. elegans genes in different tissues. Together, these studies suggest the importance of specific bacterial metabolites in regulating the hosts physiology, and provide a tool to prevent confounding effects when analyzing genotype-phenotype interactions under different bacterial backgrounds.",

    "abstract": "Peroxisomal proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) are sensors of dietary lipids and pharmacological targets in the treatment of metabolic disorders. PPAR ligands are also immunosuppressive. However, their function during infection is debated and the mechanisms that underlie their immunoregulatory properties are unclear. We investigated the consequences of PPAR activation during herpesvirus infection. We found that activation of PPAR- increased herpesvirus replication, suppressed type I interferon production and induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). We discovered that ROS induced by PPAR- stimulation suppressed the cytoplasmic DNA sensing pathway after direct activation of stimulator of interferon (STING), the ER adapter downstream of cytoplasmic DNA recognition. Although high ROS induces inflammasome activation and cytokine production, we found that ROS inhibited interferon production after cytoplasmic DNA recognition. Treatment of mice with a clinically relevant agonist of PPAR- increased herpesvirus replication and pathogenesis, comparable to levels observed previously in type I interferon receptor knockout mice. These findings reveal that activation of PPAR- regulates immunity to cytoplasmic DNA and DNA virus infection through inhibition of interferon. Moreover, these results demonstrate that STING signaling and interferon production is regulated by ROS.",

    "abstract": "Bone marrow (BM) stromal cells provide the structural and regulatory framework for hematopoiesis and contribute to developmental-stage specific niches, such as those preserving hematopoietic stem cell (HSCs). Despite recent advances in our understanding of stromal composition and function, little is known on the dynamic transcriptional remodeling that this compartment undergoes over time and during adaptation to stress. Similarly, how molecular changes in stroma are linked to age-related modulation of hematopoiesis is poorly understood. Using RNA-sequencing, we performed a longitudinal comparison of the transcriptional profile of four principal mesenchymal and endothelial stromal subsets, namely CXCL12-abundant reticular (CARc), PDGFR-+Sca-1+, sinusoidal (SECs) and arterial endothelial cells (AECs), isolated from early postnatal, adult and aged mice. Our data i) provide molecular fingerprints defining novel, cell-specific anatomical and functional features ii) reveal radical reprogramming of pro-hematopoietic, immune and matrisomic transcriptional programs during the narrow temporal transition from juvenile to adult stages iii) demonstrate that homeostatic aging is characterized by a progressive and pronounced upregulation of pro-inflammatory gene-expression and loss of stromal cell fitness. By profiling in vivo responses of stromal cells to infection-mimicking agents, we finally demonstrate that transcriptomic pathways elicited by sterile inflammation are largely recapitulated during aging, thereby supporting the inflammatory basis of aging-related adaptations of BM hematopoietic function.",

Despite its importance, many aspects of basic Xanthomonas biology remain unknown or understudied. Here, we present the first genus-wide analysis of CRISPR-Cas in Xanthomonas and describe specific aspects of its occurrence. Our results show that Xanthomonas genomes harbour subtype I-C and I-F CRISPR-Cas systems and that species belonging to distantly Xanthomonas-related genera in Xanthomonadaceae exhibit the same configuration of coexistence of the I-C and I-F CRISPR subtypes. Additionally, phylogenetic analysis using Cas proteins indicated that the CRISPR systems present in Xanthomonas spp. are the result of an ancient acquisition. Despite the close phylogeny of these systems, they present significant variation in both the number and targets of spacers. An interesting characteristic observed in this study was that the identified plasmid-targeting spacers were always driven toward plasmids found in other Xanthomonas strains, indicating that CRISPR-Cas systems could be very effective in coping with plasmidial infections. Since many effectors are plasmid encoded, CRISPR-Cas might be driving specific characteristics of plant-pathogen interactions.",

    "abstract": "Chagas disease (CD) is a parasitic infection caused by Trypanosoma cruzi protozoa. Over 8 million people worldwide are T. cruzi-positive, 20-30% of which will develop cardiomyopathy, megaoesophagus and/or megacolon. The mechanisms leading to gastrointestinal (GI) symptom development are however poorly understood. To address this issue, we systematically characterized the spatial impact of experimental T. cruzi infection on the microbiome and metabolome across the GI tract. The largest microbiota perturbations were observed in the proximal large intestine in both acute and chronic disease, with chronic-stage effects also observed in the cecum. Strikingly, metabolomic impact of acute-to-chronic stage transition differed depending on the organ, with persistent large-scale effects of infection primarily in the oesophagus and large intestine, providing a potential mechanism for GI pathology tropism in CD. Infection particularly affected acylcarnitine and lipid metabolism. Building on these observations, treatment of infected mice with carnitine-supplemented drinking water prevented acute-stage mortality with no changes in parasite burden. Overall, these results identified a new mechanism of disease tolerance in CD, with potential for the development of new therapeutic regimens. More broadly, these results highlight the potential of spatially-resolved metabolomic approaches to provide insight into disease pathogenesis, with translational applications for infectious disease drug development.",

    "abstract": "The goal of many single-cell studies on eukaryotic cells is to gain insight into the biochemical reactions that control cell fate and state. In this paper we introduce the concept of effective stoichiometric space (ESS) to guide the reconstruction of biochemical networks from multiplexed, fixed time-point, single-cell data. In contrast to methods based solely on statistical models of data, the ESS method leverages the power of the geometric theory of toric varieties to begin unraveling the structure of chemical reaction networks (CRN). This application of toric theory enables a data-driven mapping of covariance relationships in single cell measurements into stoichiometric information, one in which each cell subpopulation has its associated ESS interpreted in terms of CRN theory. In the development of ESS we reframe certain aspects of the theory of CRN to better match data analysis. As an application of our approach we process cytomery- and image-based single-cell datasets and identify differences in cells treated with kinase inhibitors. Our approach is directly applicable to data acquired using readily accessible experimental methods such as Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) and multiplex immunofluorescence.\\n\\nAuthor summaryWe introduce a new notion, which we call the effective stoichiometric space (ESS), that elucidates network structure from the covariances of single-cell multiplexed data. The ESS approach differs from methods that are based on purely statistical models of data: it allows a completely new and data-driven translation of the theory of toric varieties in geometry and specifically their role in chemical reaction networks (CRN). In the process, we reframe certain aspects of the theory of CRN. As illustrations of our approach, we find stoichiometry in different single-cell datasets, and pinpoint dose-dependence of network perturbations in drug-treated cells.",

The model is rigorously benchmarked against independent datasets and alternative models, exhibiting unmatched performance in the recall of known functional PTM sites and the recommendation of PTMs that were later confirmed experimentally.

Use of traditional herbs has proven effective in reducing the incidence of infection in some high-risk groups. To assess the effects of Momordica charantia leaf extracts that influence blood infestation, in vitro study of the effect on macrophages and neutrophils, and treatment of mouse model of S. typhi infection was done. Methanol and diethyl ether extracts were concerned by this study. In vitro study was to assess the effects of extracts on phagocytosis and related intracellular killing mechanisms of macrophages were examined. Later, mobilization of leukocytes and production of antibodies against S. typhi were measured followed by quantitating cultures evaluation of the blood infestation of orally inoculated mice with S. thyphi. Ingestion or attachment of carbon particles, production of superoxide anion, nitric oxide and that of lysosomal acid phosphatase by macrophages and neutrophils were significantly increased by methanol and diethyl extracts at concentrations ranging from 40 g/ml to 640 g/ml. Antibody titer and mobilization of leukocytes, particularly lymphocytes against S. typhi were highly increased by both methanol and diethyl extracts at concentrations of 500 and 1000 mg/kg. In the same the extracts have reduced the rate of blood infestation in mice inoculated with 108 CFU of S. typhi for 28 days. Reduction in blood infestation rates was similar for levamisole mice group. Results of this study should prove useful of leave of Momordica charantia for treatment of infections by salmonella strains and for assessment of drugs for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "Sleep-mediated overnight consolidation was found to facilitate perceptual learning by promoting learners generalization across talkers in their perception of novel segmental categories. Lexical tone differs from most segmental contrasts in that it is highly variable across talkers, and displays dynamic change over time. It remains unclear whether a similar (or a larger) effect of overnight consolidation would be found for perceptual learning of novel tonal contrasts. Thus, this study aims to examine whether overnight consolidation facilitates generalization across talkers in the discrimination and identification of novel Cantonese level tones by Mandarin listeners. Two groups of Mandarin listeners were perceptually trained either in the morning or in the evening. Listeners were trained in a tone identification (ID) task using stimuli produced by a trained talker. Their development was then tested in the ID and AX discrimination tasks using stimuli produced by trained and untrained talkers in three posttests following training: immediately after training, 12-hour delay, and 24-hour delay. While the evening group slept between the first and second posttests, the morning group did not. The results of accuracy rates in the ID task showed that while Mandarin listeners trained in the evening showed an improved trend, predicted by their individual sleep time, in identifying the level tones produced by both the trained and untrained talkers, Mandarin listeners trained in the morning showed a declining trend. In contrast, the results of d-prime scores in the AX discrimination task did not show different developmental patterns between the two groups. Consistent with previous studies on segmental learning, the finding suggests that overnight consolidation might have assisted the evening trainees formation of a more abstract (talker-independent) representation of novel tone categories in memory traces. The results are discussed regarding the features of lexical tones to shed light on the mechanism of phonetic learning.",
