    "abstract": "AbstractTranscriptomic profiling classifies pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) into several molecular subtypes with distinctive histological and clinical characteristics. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that define each subtype and their correlation with clinical outcome. Mutant KRAS is the most prominent driver in PDAC, present in over 90% of tumors, but the dependence of tumors on oncogenic KRAS signaling varies between subtypes. In particular, squamous subtype are relatively independent of oncogenic KRAS signaling and typically display much more aggressive clinical behavior versus progenitor subtype. Here, we identified that YAP1 activation is enriched in the squamous subtype and associated with poor prognosis. Activation of YAP1 in progenitor subtype cancer cells profoundly enhanced malignant phenotypes and transformed progenitor subtype cells into squamous subtype. Conversely, depletion of YAP1 specifically suppressed tumorigenicity of squamous subtype PDAC cells. Mechanistically, we uncovered a significant positive correlation between WNT5A expression and the YAP1 activity in human PDAC, and demonstrated that WNT5A overexpression led to YAP1 activation and recapitulated YAP1-dependent but Kras-independent phenotype of tumor progression and maintenance. Thus, our study identifies YAP1 oncogene as a major driver of squamous subtype PDAC and uncovers the role of WNT5A in driving PDAC malignancy through activation of the YAP pathway.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the human LMNA gene, which encodes the nuclear envelope (NE) proteins lamins A and C, cause autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, congenital muscular dystrophy, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, and other diseases collectively known as laminopathies. The molecular mechanisms responsible for these diseases remain incompletely understood, but the muscle-specific defects suggest that mutations may render nuclei more susceptible to mechanical stress. Using three mouse models of muscle laminopathies, we found that Lmna mutations caused extensive NE abnormalities, consisting of chromatin protrusions into the cytoplasm and transient rupture of the NE in skeletal muscle cells. NE damage was associated with DNA damage, activation of DNA damage response pathways, and reduced viability. Intriguingly, NE damage resulted from nuclear migration in maturing skeletal muscle cells, rather than actomyosin contractility. NE damage and DNA damage was reduced by either depletion of kinesin-1 or disruption of the Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex. LINC complex disruption rescued myofiber function and viability in Lmna mutant myofibers, indicating that the myofiber dysfunction is the result of mechanically induced NE damage. The extent of NE damage and DNA damage in Lmna mouse models correlated with the disease onset and severity in vivo. Moreover, inducing DNA damage in wild-type muscle cells was sufficient to phenocopy the reduced cell viability of lamin A/C-deficient muscle cells, suggesting a causative role of DNA damage in disease pathogenesis. Corroborating the mouse model data, muscle biopsies from patients with LMNA muscular dystrophy revealed significant DNA damage compared to age-matched controls, particularly in severe cases of the disease. Taken together, these findings point to a new and important role of DNA damage as a pathogenic contributor for LMNA skeletal muscle diseases.",

    "abstract": "Xanthomonas oryzae is a devastating pathogen of rice worldwide, however, X. sontii and X. maliensis are its non-pathogenic counterparts from the same host. So far, these non-pathogenic isolates were overlooked due to their less economic importance and lack of genomic information. We have carried out detailed ecological and evolutionary study focusing on diverse lifestyles of these strains. Phylogenomic analysis revealed two major lineages corresponding to X. sontii (ML-I) and X. oryzae (ML-II) species. Interestingly, one of the non-pathogenic Xanthomonas strains belonging to X. maliensis is intermediary to both the major lineages/species suggesting on-going diversification and selection. Accordingly, pangenome analysis revealed large number of lifestyle specific genes with atypical GC content indicating role of horizontal gene transfer in genome diversification. Our comprehensive comparative genomic investigation of major lineages has revealed that impact of recombination is more for X. sontii as compared to X. oryzae. Acquisition of type III secretion system and its effectome along with a type VI secretion system also seem to have played a major role in the pathogenic lineage. Other known key pathogenicity clusters or genes like biofilm forming cluster, cellobiohydrolase and non-fimbrial adhesin (yapH) are exclusive to pathogenic lineage. However, commonality of loci encoding exopolysacharide, rpf signalling molecule, iron-uptake, xanthomonadin pigment, etc. suggests their essentiality in host adaptation. Overall, this study reveals evolutionary history of pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains and will further open up a new avenue for better management of pathogenic strains for sustainable cultivation of a major staple food crop.",

    "abstract": "The glucocorticoid (GC) hormone cortisol is often measured in animals to indicate their welfare and stress levels. However, the levels of other naturally occurring GCs are usually overlooked. We aimed to investigate whether aspects of the care and conditions of harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) pups in rehabilitation centres are reflected in urinary concentrations of four endogenous GCs. Urine samples were collected non-invasively from pups taken in as \"orphans\" at five different rehabilitation centres: three on the Irish Sea and two in the southern North Sea. Concentrations of urinary cortisol, cortisone, prednisolone and prednisone were analysed by mass spectrometry. Urinary concentrations of endogenous prednisolone and prednisone occurred in similar magnitude to cortisol, for the first time in any mammal species. The levels of all GC concentrations decreased as pups gained mass, but the most significant effect was for prednisone. Pups with mass less than 11kg, i.e. healthy average birth mass, had significantly higher levels of prednisone (but not of the other GCs) than pups of 11kg or more. Cortisol, cortisone and prednisolone concentrations were slightly higher for pups without access to water than those with water; however, we found no significant effect of social group on GC levels. Based on these findings, we tentatively suggest that the GCs may be elevated in harbour seal pups during rehabilitation in response to some physiological factors deviating from the norm of free-living pups. Our findings highlight the importance of measuring other GCs, in addition to cortisol, for understanding stressors affecting the welfare of seal pup in rehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "Describing the pattern of region-to-region functional connectivity is an important step towards understanding information transfer and transformation between brain regions. Although fMRI data are limited in spatial resolution, recent advances in technology afford more precise mapping. Here, we extended previous methods, connective field mapping, to 3 dimensions to provide a more concise estimate of the organization and potential information transformation from one region to another. We first replicated previous work with the 3 dimensional model by showing that the topology of functional connectivity between early visual regions maintained along their eccentricity axis or the anterior-posterior dimension. We then examined higher order visual regions (e,g, fusiform face area) and showed that their pattern of connectivity, the convergence and biased sampling, seem to contribute to some of their core receptive field properties. We further demonstrated that linearity of input is a fundamental aspect of functional connectivity of the whole brain, with higher linearity between regions within a network than across networks; that is, high connective linearity was evident between early visual areas, and between prefrontal areas, but less evident between them. By decomposing the whole brain linearity matrix with manifold learning techniques, we found that the principle mode of the linearity maps onto decompositions in both functional connectivity and genetic expression reported in previous studies. The current work provides evidence supporting that linearity of input is likely a fundamental motif of functional connectivity between regions for information processing across the brain, with high linearity preserving the integrity of information from one region to another within a network.",

We study the effect of ZIKV infection with various strains on subsequent DENV immune response after 10 and 2 months of ZIKV infection in rhesus macaques. Our results show that a subsequent DENV infection in animals with early- and middle-convalescent periods to ZIKV do not promote an increase in DENV viremia nor pro-inflammatory status. Previous ZIKV exposure increases the magnitude of the antibody and T cell responses against DENV, and different time intervals between infections alter the magnitude and durability of such responses--more after longer ZIKV pre-exposure. Collectively, we find no evidence of a detrimental effect of ZIKV immunity in a subsequent DENV infection. This supports the implementation of ZIKV vaccines that could also boost immunity against future DENV epidemics.",

    "abstract": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encodes an ER-resident glycoprotein, UL148, which activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) but is fully dispensable for viral replication in cultured cells. Hence, its previously ascribed roles in immune evasion and modulation of viral cell tropism are hypothesized to cause ER stress. Here, we show that UL148 is necessary and sufficient to drive the formation of large ER-derived structures that occupy up to 7% of the infected cell cytosol. The structures are found to be sites where UL148 coalesces with cellular proteins involved in ER quality control, such as Hrd1 and EDEM1. Transmission electron microscopy analyses reveal the structures to be comprised of tortuous, densely packed and apparently collapsed ER membranes that connect to distended cisternae. During induced ectopic expression of UL148-GFP fusion protein, punctate signals traffic to accumulate at prominent structures that exhibit poor recovery of fluorescence after photobleaching. Small molecule blockade of the integrated stress response (ISR) prevents the formation of puncta, leading to a uniform reticular fluorescent signal. Accordingly, ISR inhibition during HCMV infection abolishes the coalescence of UL148 and Hrd1 into discrete structures, which argues that UL148 requires the ISR to cause ER reorganization. Given that UL148 stabilizes immature forms of a receptor binding subunit for a viral envelope glycoprotein complex important for HCMV infectivity, our results imply that stress-dependent ER remodeling contributes to viral cell tropism.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEPerturbations to ER morphology occur during infection with various intracellular pathogens and in certain genetic disorders. We identify that an HCMV gene product, UL148, profoundly reorganizes the ER during infection, and is sufficient to do so when expressed on its own. Our results reveal that UL148-dependent reorganization of the ER is a prominent feature of HCMV infected cells. Moreover, we find that this example of virally induced organelle remodeling requires the integrated stress response (ISR), a stress adaptation pathway that contributes to a number of disease states. Since ER reorganization accompanies the roles of UL148 in HCMV cell tropism and intracellular retention of the immune cell co-stimulatory ligand CD58, our results may have implications for understanding the mechanisms involved. Furthermore, our findings provide a basis to utilize UL148 as a tool to investigate organelle responses to stress and to identify novel drugs targeting the ISR.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the genomic signatures, genes, and traits underlying local adaptation of organisms to heterogeneous environments is of central importance to the field evolutionary biology. Mixed linear mrsodels that identify allele associations to environment, while controlling for genome-wide variation at other loci, have emerged as the method of choice when studying local adaptation. Despite their importance, it is unclear whether this approach performs better than identifying environmentally-associated SNPs without accounting for population structure. To examine this, we first use the mixed linear model GEMMA, and simple Spearman correlations, to identify SNPs showing significant associations to climate with and without accounting for population structure. Subsequently, using Italy and Sweden populations, we compare evidence of allele frequency differentiation (FST), linkage disequilibrium (LD), fitness variation, and functional constraint, underlying these SNPs. Using a lenient cut-off for significance, we find that SNPs identified by both approaches, and SNPs uniquely identified by Spearman correlations, were enriched at sites showing genomic evidence of local adaptation and function but were limited across Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) explaining fitness variation. SNPs uniquely identified by GEMMA, showed no direct or indirect evidence of local adaptation, and no enrichment along putative functional sites. Finally, SNPs that showed significantly high FST and LD, were enriched along fitness QTL peaks and cis-regulatory/nonsynonymous sites showing significant functional constraint. Using these SNPs, we identify genes underlying fitness QTL, and genes linking flowering time to local adaptation. These include a regulator of abscisic-acid (FLDH) and flowering time genes PIF3, FIO1, and COL5.",

    "abstract": "Hosts defend themselves against pathogens by mounting an immune response. Fully understanding the immune response as a driver of host disease and pathogen evolution requires a quantitative account of its impact on parasite population dynamics. Here, we use a data-driven modeling approach to quantify the birth and death processes underlying the dynamics of infections of the rodent malaria parasite, Plasmodium chabaudi, and the red blood cells (RBCs) it targets. We decompose the immune response into three components, each with a distinct effect on parasite and RBC vital rates, and quantify the relative contribution of each component to host disease and parasite density. Our analysis suggests that these components are deployed in a coordinated fashion to realize distinct resource-directed defense strategies that complement the killing of parasitized cells. Early in the infection, the host deploys a strategy reminiscent of siege and scorched-earth tactics, in which it both restricts the supply of RBCs and destroys them. Late in the infection, a  juvenilization strategy, in which turnover of RBCs is accelerated, allows the host to recover from anemia while holding parasite proliferation at bay. By quantifying the impact of immunity on both parasite fitness and host disease, we reveal that phenomena often interpreted as immunopathology may in fact be beneficial to the host. Finally, we show that, across mice, the components of the host response are consistently related to each other, even when infections take qualitatively different trajectories. This suggests the existence of simple rules that govern the immune systems deployment.",

    "abstract": "Carbapenemases inactivate most {beta}-lactam antibiotics, including carbapenems and have been frequently reported among Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas spp. Traditionally, the horizontal gene transfer of carbapenemase encoding genes (CEGs) has been linked to plasmids. However, given that integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) are possibly the most abundant conjugative elements among prokaryotes, we conducted an in-silico analysis to ascertain the likely role of ICEs in the spread of CEGs among all bacterial genomes (n=182,663). We detected 17,520 CEGs, of which 66 were located within putative ICEs among several bacterial species (including clinically-relevant bacteria as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli). Most CEGs detected within ICEs belong to the IMP, NDM and SPM metallo-beta-lactamase families, and the serine beta-lactamase KPC and GES families. Different mechanisms were likely responsible for acquisition of these genes. The majority of CEG-bearing ICEs belong to the MPFG, MPFT and MPFF classes and often encode resistance to other antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones). This study provides a snapshot of the different CEGs associated with ICEs among available bacterial genomes and sheds light on the underappreciated contribution of ICEs to the spread of carbapenem resistance globally.\n\nAuthor NotesAll supporting data has been provided within the article or through supplementary data files. Supplementary material is available with the online version of this article.\n\nImpact StatementCarbapenems are commonly used to treat severe infections in humans. Resistance is often mediated by carbapenemases. These enzymes degrade carbapenems and are frequently present in plasmids. Here, we demonstrate that common carbapenemase-encoding genes (CEGs) found in clinical isolates (e.g. blaKPC, blaGES, blaIMP, blaNDM, blaVIM) can also be located within integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs). CEG-bearing ICEs belong to three mating-pair formation families. These mobile elements may be particularly important in bacteria where plasmids do not seem to play a significant role in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes, as Pseudomonas spp. This study considerably expands the knowledge of the repertoire of CEGs-bearing ICEs among clinically-relevant bacterial pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli.\n\nData SummaryAll the bacterial genomes scanned in this study have been deposited previously in the National Center for Biotechnology Information genome database and are listed on the supplementary tables.

The role of signal dynamics in transferring signalling information in vivo is incompletely understood. Here we employ genome engineering in Drosophila melanogaster to generate a functional optogenetic allele of the Notch ligand Delta (opto-Delta), which replaces both copies of the endogenous wild type locus. Using clonal analysis, we show that optogenetic activation blocks Notch activation through cis-inhibition in signal-receiving cells. Signal perturbation in combination with quantitative analysis of a live transcriptional reporter of Notch pathway activity reveals differential tissue- and cell-scale regulatory modes. While at the tissue-level the duration of Notch signalling determines the probability with which a cellular response will occur, in individual cells Notch activation acts through a switch-like mechanism. Thus, time confers regulatory properties to Notch signalling that exhibit integrative digital behaviours during tissue differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Amino acids (AAs) and one-carbon (1-C) compounds are involved in a range of key metabolic pathways, and mediate numerous health and disease processes in the human body. Previous assays have quantified a limited selection of these compounds. Here, we describe an analytical method for the simultaneous quantification of 37 1-C metabolites, amino acids, precursors, and plasmalogens using reversed-phase ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). Compound extraction from human plasma was tested manually before being robotically automated. The final analytical panel was validated on human plasma samples. Our automated and multiplexed method holds promise for application to large cohort studies.",

    "abstract": "Aggregation of misfolded prion proteins causes fatal neurodegenerative disorders in both humans and animals. There is an extensive effort to identify the elusive aggregation-prone conformations (N*) of prions, which are early stage precursors to aggregation. Ve studied temperature and force induced unfolding of the structured C-terminal domain of mouse (moPrP) and human prion proteins (hPrP) using molecular dynamics simulations and coarse-grained protein models. Ve find that these proteins sparsely populate intermediate states bearing the features of N* and readily undergo domain-swapped dimerization by swapping the short {beta}-strands present at the beginning of the C-terminal domain. Structure of the N* state is similar for both moPrP and hPrP, indicating a common pathogenic precursor across diferent species. Interestingly, disease-resistant hPrP (G127V) showed a drastic reduction in the population of N* state further hinting a pathogenic connection to these partially denatured conformations. This study proposes a plausible runaway domain swapping mechanism to describe the onset of prion aggregation.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 150 triatomine species are known to be infected with the Chagas parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, but they differ in the risk they pose to human populations. The largest risk comes from species that have a domestic life cycle and these species have been targeted by indoor residual spraying campaigns, which have been successful in many locations. It is now important to consider residual transmission that may be linked to persistent populations of dominant vectors, or to secondary or minor vectors. The aim of this project was to define the geographical distributions of the community of triatomine species in Latin America. Presence-only data with over 12, 000 observations of triatomine vectors were extracted from a public database and target-group background data were generated to account for sampling bias in the presence data. Geostatistical regression was then applied to estimate species distributions and fine-scale distribution maps were generated for thirty triatomine vector species. The results for Panstrongylus geniculatus, P. megistus, Triatoma barberi, T. brasiliensis, and T. pseudomaculata are presented in detail and the model validation results for each of the 30 species are presented in full. The predictive maps for all species are made publicly available so that they can be used to assess the communities of vectors present within different regions of the endemic zone. The maps are presented alongside key indicators for the capacity of each species to transmit T. cruzi to humans. These indicators include infection prevalence, evidence for human blood meals, and colonisation or invasion of homes. A summary of these indicators shows that the majority of the 30 species mapped by this study have the potential to transmit T. cruzi to humans.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe Pan American Health Organisations Strategy and Plan of Action for Chagas Disease Prevention, Control and Care highlights the importance of eliminating those triatomine vector species that colonise homes, and has had great success in many locations. Since indoor residual spraying campaigns have targeted these species, their importance relative to other vectors has diminished and their geographical distributions may also have changed. It is now vital to consider the full community of vector species, including previously dominant vectors as well as secondary or minor vector species, in order to target residual transmission to humans. Our aim was to define the geographical distributions of the most commonly reported triatomine species in Latin America. We extracted reports of triatomine vector species observed at specific locations from a public database and we used a geostatistical model to generate fine-scale predictive maps for thirty triatomine vector species. We present these maps alongside a summary of key indicators related to the capacity of each species to transmit the Chagas parasite to humans. We show that most of the 30 species that we have mapped pose a potential threat to human populations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\\n\\nDeposits of amyloid fibrils of -synuclein are the histological hallmarks of Parkinsons disease, multiple system atrophy, and dementia with Lewy bodies. Although most cases of these diseases are sporadic, autosomal-dominant hereditary mutations have been linked to Parkinsons disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Seeing the changes to the structure of amyloid fibrils bearing these mutations may help to understand these diseases. To this end, we determined the cryo-EM structures of -synuclein fibrils containing the H50Q hereditary mutation. We find that the H50Q mutation results in two new polymorphs of -synuclein, which we term Narrow and Wide Fibrils. Both polymorphs recapitulate the conserved kernel formed by residues 50-77 observed in wild-type structures; however, the Narrow and Wide Fibrils reveal that H50Q disrupts a key interaction between H50-E57 on the opposing protofilament, abolishing the extensive protofilament interface formed by preNAC residues in the wild-type \\\"rod\\\" structure. Instead, the Narrow Fibril is formed from a single protofilament and the two protofilaments of the Wide protofilament are held together by only a pair of atoms - the C{gamma} atoms from the two threonine 59 sidechains. Further, we find that H50Q forms an intramolecular hydrogen bond with K45 leading to the formation of a novel {beta}-arch formed by residues 36-46 that features an extensive hydrogen-bond network between Y39, T44, and E46. The structures of the H50Q polymorphs help to rationalize the faster aggregation kinetics, higher seeding capacity in biosensor cells, and greater cytotoxicity we observe for H50Q compared to wild-type -synuclein.",
