    "abstract": "Proteinase Activated Receptor-4 (PAR4) is a member of the proteolytically-activated PAR family of G-Protein-coupled Receptors (GPCRs). PARs are activated following proteolytic cleavage of the receptor N-terminus by enzymes such as thrombin, trypsin, and cathepsin-G to reveal the receptor-activating motif termed the tethered ligand. The tethered ligand binds intramolecularly to the receptor and triggers receptor signalling and cellular responses. In spite of this unusual mechanism of activation, PARs are fundamentally peptide receptors and can also be activated by exogenous application of short synthetic peptides derived from the tethered ligand sequence. In order to gain a better understanding of the molecular basis for PAR4-dependent signalling, we examined signalling responses to a library of peptides derived from the canonical PAR4 activating peptide (PAR4-AP), AYPGKF-NH2. We examined peptide residues involved in activation of the Gq/11-coupled calcium signalling pathway, {beta}-arrestin recruitment, and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation. The peptide N-methyl-alanine-YPGKF-NH2 was identified as a compound that is a poor activator of PAR4-dependent calcium signalling but was fully competent in recruiting {beta}-arrestin-1 and -2. In order to gain a better understanding of the ligand-binding pocket, we used in silico docking to identify key residues involved in PAR4 interaction with AYPGKF-NH2. The predicted interactions were verified by site-directed mutagenesis and analysis of calcium signalling and {beta}-arrestin-1/-2 recruitment following proteolytic activation (with thrombin) or activation with the synthetic agonist peptide (AYPGKF-NH2). We determined that a key extracellular loop-2 aspartic acid residue (Asp230) is critical for signalling following both proteolytic and peptide activation of PAR4. Finally, we investigated platelet aggregation in response to AyPGKF-NH2 (a peptide with D-tyrosine in position two) which is unable to activate calcium signalling, and AYPGRF-NH2 a peptide that is equipotent to the parental peptide AYPGKF-NH2 for calcium signalling but is more potent at recruiting {beta}-arrestins. We found that AyPGKF-NH2 fails to activate platelets while AYPGRF-NH2 causes a platelet aggregation response that is greater than that seen with the parental peptide and is comparable to that seen with thrombin stimulation. Overall, these studies uncover molecular determinants for agonist binding and signalling through a non-canonically activated GPCR and provide a template for development of small molecule modulators of PAR4.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: New ways to target and treat metastatic disease are urgently needed. Tumor \\\"self-homing\\\" describes the recruitment of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) back to a previously excised primary tumor location, contributing to tumor recurrence, as well as their migration to established metastatic lesions. Recently, self-homing CTCs have been exploited as delivery vehicles for anti-cancer therapeutics in preclinical primary tumor models. However, the ability of CTCs to self-home and treat metastatic disease is largely unknown. Methods: Here, we employ molecular imaging to explore whether systemically-administered CTCs home to metastatic lesions and if CTCs armed with both a reporter gene and a cytotoxic prodrug gene therapy can be used to visualize and treat metastatic disease. Results: Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) performed over time revealed a remarkable ability of CTCs to home to primary and metastatic tumors throughout the body. Mice that received therapeutic CTCs had less BLI signal as well as less primary tumour burden than control mice. Preliminary data also showed self-homing therapeutic CTCs may be effective at treating disseminated breast cancer metastases. Conclusion: Using dual-luciferase BLI, this study demonstrates the noteworthy ability of experimental CTCs to home to disseminated breast cancer lesions. Moreover, by incorporating a prodrug gene therapy system into our self-homing CTCs, we show exciting progress towards effective and targeted delivery of gene-based therapeutics to treat both primary and metastatic lesions.",

    "abstract": "Choline is an essential nutrient required for normal neuronal and muscular development, as well as homeostatic regulation of hepatic metabolism. In the liver, choline is incorporated into the main eukaryotic phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine (PC) and can enter one carbon metabolism via mitochondrial oxidation. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a hepatotropic positive-strand RNA virus that similar to other positive-strand RNA viruses can impact phospholipid metabolism. In the current study we sought to interrogate the link between choline transport and early HCV infection. Namely, we aimed to investigate how HCV modulates markers of choline metabolism following in vitro infection, while subsequently assessing how the inhibition of choline uptake and metabolism upon concurrent HCV infection may alter early viral replication. Finally, we assessed whether these parameters were consistent between cells cultured in fetal bovine serum (FBS) or human serum (HS), conditions known to differentially affect in vitro HCV infection. We observed that choline transport in FBS-cultured Huh7.5 cells is facilitated by the intermediate affinity transporter choline transporter-like family (CTL), and that CTL1 expression and the incorporation of choline into PC is diminished in 24 h infected FBS-cultured cells. Reciprocally, limiting the availability of choline for PC synthesis resulted in increased HCV replication at this early stage. In chronically HS-cultured Huh7.5 cells, there were no differences in the expression of choline transporters upon HCV infection or alterations to viral replication when choline transport was inhibited compared to control treatments. However, inhibiting choline uptake and metabolism in this system significantly impaired the production of infectious virions in HS-cultured cells. These results suggest that in addition to a known role of choline kinase, the transport of choline, potentially via CTL1, might also represent an important and regulated process during HCV infection.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=107 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/746776v1_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (56K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@133a652org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ec8fa8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cb7626org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b9bbc2_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Choline is an essential nutrient that is critical component of the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylcholine (PC), the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and the methylation pathway. In the liver specifically, PC is the major membrane constituent and can be synthesized by the CDP-choline or the phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) N-methyltransferase (PEMT) pathway. With the continuing global rise in the rates of obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, we sought to explore how excess fatty acids (FA), typical of an obesity and hepatic steatosis, affect choline uptake and metabolism in primary hepatocytes. Our results demonstrate that hepatocytes chronically treated with palmitate, but not oleate or a mixture, had decreased choline uptake, which was associated with lower choline incorporation into PC and lower expression of choline transport proteins. Interestingly, a reduction in the rate of degradation spared PC levels in response to palmitate when compared to control. PE synthesis was slightly diminished; however, no compensatory changes in the PEMT pathway were observed. We next hypothesized that ER stress may be a potential mechanism by which palmitate treatment diminished choline. However, when we exposed primary hepatocytes to the common ER stress inducing compound tunicamycin, choline uptake, contrary to our expectation was augmented, concomitant with the transcript expression of choline transporters. Moreover, tunicamycin-induced ER stress divorced the observed increase in choline uptake from CDP-choline pathway flux since ER stress significantly diminished the incorporation and total PC content, similar to PE. Conclusion: Therefore, our results suggest that the altered FA milieu seen in obesity and fatty liver disease progression may adversely affect choline metabolism, but that compensatory mechanisms work to maintain phospholipid homeostasis.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=175 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/746750v1_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (42K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1090f2aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c28eedorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@35a80eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ac5a53_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The impact of mechanical stress during cell migration may be a previously unappreciated source of genome instability [1-3], but to what extent this happens in vivo remains unknown. Here we consider an in vivo system where the adult stem cells of planarian flatworms are required to migrate to a distal wound site [4]. We observe a relationship between adult stem cell migration and ongoing DNA damage and repair during tissue regeneration. Migrating planarian stem cells undergo changes in nuclear shape and increased levels of DNA damage. Increased DNA damage levels resolve once stem cells reach the wound site and stop migrating. Stem cells in which DNA damage is induced prior to wounding take longer to initiate migration suggesting migration activity is sensitive to DNA damage. Migrating stem cells populations are more sensitive to further DNA damage than stationary stem cells, providing evidence that levels of migration-coupled-DNA-damage (MCDD) are significant. RNAi mediated knockdown of DNA repair pathway components blocks normal stem cell migration, confirming that DNA repair pathways are required to allow successful migration to a distal wound site. Together these lines of evidence demonstrate that migration leans to DNA damage in vivo and requires DNA repair mechanisms. Our findings reveal that migration of stem cells represents an unappreciated source of damage, that could be a significant source of mutations in animals during development or during long term tissue homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Proteinase-Activated Receptors (PARs) are a four-member family of G-protein coupled receptors that are activated via proteolysis. PAR4 is a member of this family that is cleaved and activated by serine proteinases such as thrombin, trypsin and cathepsin-G. PAR4 is expressed in a variety of tissues and cell types including platelets, vascular smooth muscle cells and neuronal cells. In studying PAR4 signalling and trafficking, we observed dynamic changes in the cell membrane with spherical membrane protrusions that resemble plasma membrane blebbing. Since non-apoptotic membrane blebbing is now recognized as an important regulator of cell migration, cancer cell invasion, and vesicular content release we sought to elucidate the signalling pathway downstream of PAR4 activation that leads to such events. Using a combination of pharmacological inhibition and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene-editing approaches we establish that PAR4-dependent membrane blebbing occurs independently of the Gq/11 and Gi signalling pathways and is dependent on signalling via the {beta}-arrestin-1/-2 and RhoA signalling pathways. In order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of {beta}-arrestin-mediated signalling downstream of PAR4 and to guide future studies, we undertook RNA-seq analysis of PAR4 activated genes in control cells and in cells lacking {beta}-arrestin-1/-2. A list of differentially expressed genes was generated followed by Gene Ontology (GO) and enrichment analysis, revealing PAR4 regulation of genes involved in processes including blood coagulation and circulation, cell-cell adhesion, sensory perception and neuron-neuron synaptic transmission-terms that relate back to known functions of PAR4 and are consistent with our finding of membrane blebbing triggered by PAR4 activation. Together these studies provide further mechanistic insight into PAR4 regulation of cellular function.\\n\\nSignificance StatementWe find that the thrombin receptor PAR4 triggers cell membrane blebbing in a RhoA- and {beta}-arrestin-dependent manner. In addition to identifying novel cellular responses mediated by PAR4, these data provide further evidence for biased signaling in PAR4 since membrane blebbing was dependent on some, but not all, signaling pathways activated by PAR4. Finally through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeting and RNA-seq analysis we catalogue here PAR4-dependent transcription that is dependent on {beta}-arrestin.",

While small molecule delivery via nanomedicine has promising applications for a number of chronic diseases, there remain questions as to how nanoparticle formulation might be tailored to suit different tissue microenvironments and aid in drug delivery. In the current study, we compared the drug delivery capability of three nanoparticle (NP) formulations encapsulating the LXR activator, GW-3956. We observed little difference in the base characteristics of standard PLGA-PEG NP when compared to two redox-active polymeric NP formulations (DD and DB). Moreover, we also observed similar uptake of these NP into primary mouse macrophages. After an initial acute uptake period and using the transcript and protein expression of the cholesterol efflux protein ATP binding cassette A1 (ABCA1) as a readout, we determined that while the induction of transcript expression was similar between NPs, treatment with the redox-sensitive DB formulation resulted in a higher level of ABCA1 protein 24 h after the removal of the drug-containing NPs.

    "abstract": "Reovirus is undergoing clinical testing as an oncolytic therapy for breast cancer. Given that reovirus naturally evolved to thrive in enteric environments, we sought to better understand how breast tumor microenvironments impinge on reovirus infection. Reovirus was treated with extracellular extracts generated from polyoma virus middle T-antigen-derived mouse breast tumors. Unexpectedly, these breast tumor extracellular extracts inactivated reovirus, reducing infectivity of reovirus particles by 100-fold. Mechanistically, inactivation was attributed to proteolytic cleavage of the viral cell attachment protein {sigma}1, which diminished virus binding to sialic acid-low tumor cells. Among various specific protease class inhibitors and metal ions, EDTA and ZnCl2 effectively modulated {sigma}1 cleavage, indicating that breast tumor-associated zinc-dependent metalloproteases are responsible for reovirus inactivation. Moreover, media from MCF7, MB468, MD-MB-231 and HS578T breast cancer cell lines recapitulated {sigma}1 cleavage and reovirus inactivation, suggesting that inactivation of reovirus is shared among mouse and human breast cancers, and that breast cancer cells in by themselves can be a source of reovirus-inactivating proteases. Binding assays and quantification of sialic acid (SA) levels on a panel of cancer cells showed that truncated {sigma}1 reduced virus binding to cells with low surface SA. To overcome this restriction, we generated a reovirus mutant with a mutation (T249I) in {sigma}1 that prevents {sigma}1 cleavage and inactivation by breast tumor-associated proteases. The mutant reovirus showed similar replication kinetics in tumorigenic cells, equivalent toxicity as wild-type reovirus in a severely compromised mouse model, and increased tumor titers. Overall, the data shows that tumor microenvironments have the potential to reduce infectivity of reovirus.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEWe demonstrate that metalloproteases in breast tumor microenvironments can inactivate reovirus. Our findings expose that tumor microenvironment proteases could have negative impact on proteinaceous cancer therapies such as reovirus, and that modification of such therapies to circumvent inactivation by tumor metalloproteases merits consideration.",

The putative co-chaperone CHP-1 acts as a regulator of EGFR trafficking during C.elegans vulval development. Loss of chp-1 causes the retention of the EGFR in the ER and decreased MAPK signaling. CHP-1 functions specifically, as the localization of other receptors is unaltered in chp-1(lf) mutants, and inhibiting other co-chaperones does not affect EGFR localization. The role of CHP-1 during EGFR trafficking is conserved in humans. Analogous to C.elegans, the response of CHP-1-deficient human cells to EGF stimulation is attenuated, the EGFR accumulates in the ER and ERK2 activity is decreased. Although CHP-1 has been proposed to act as a co-chaperone for HSP90, our data indicate an HSP90-independent function of CHP-1.

    "abstract": "The elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of secretion through bacterial protein secretion systems is impeded by a lack of assays to quantitatively assess secretion kinetics. Also the analysis of the biological role of these secretion systems as well as the identification of inhibitors targeting these systems would greatly benefit from the availability of a simple, quick and quantitative assay to monitor principle secretion and injection into host cells. Here we present a versatile solution to this need, utilizing the small and very bright NanoLuc luciferase to assess secretion and injection through the type III secretion system encoded by Salmonella pathogenicity island 1. The NanoLuc-based secretion assay features a very high signal-to-noise ratio and sensitivity down to the nanoliter scale. The assay enables monitoring of secretion kinetics and is adaptable to a high throughput screening format in 384-well microplates. We further developed NanoLuc and split-NanoLuc-based assays that enable the monitoring of type III secretion-dependent injection of effector proteins into host cells.\\n\\nImportanceThe ability to secrete proteins to the bacterial cell surface, to the extracellular environment, or even into target cells is one of the foundations of interbacterial as well as pathogen-host interaction. While great progress has been made in elucidating assembly and structure of secretion systems, our understanding of their secretion mechanism often lags behind, not last because of the challenge to quantitatively assess secretion function. Here, we developed a luciferase-based assay to enable the simple, quick, quantitative, and high throughput-compatible assessment of secretion and injection through virulence-associated type III secretion systems. The assay allows detection of minute amounts of secreted substrate proteins either in the supernatant of the bacterial culture or within eukaryotic host cells. It thus provides an enabling technology to elucidate the mechanisms of secretion and injection of type III secretion systems and is likely adaptable to assay secretion through other bacterial secretion systems.",
