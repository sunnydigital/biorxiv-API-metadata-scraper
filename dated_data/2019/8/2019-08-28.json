    "abstract": "Recent studies portend a rising global spread and adaptation of human- or healthcare-associated pathogens. Here, we analysed an international collection of the emerging, multidrug-resistant, opportunistic pathogen Stenotrophomonas maltophilia from 22 countries to infer population structure and clonality at a global level. We show that the S. maltophilia complex is divided into 23 monophyletic lineages, most of which harboured strains of all degrees of human virulence. Lineage Sm6 comprised the highest rate of human-associated strains, linked to key virulence and resistance genes. Transmission analysis identified potential outbreak events of genetically closely related strains isolated within days or weeks in the same hospitals.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryThe S. maltophilia complex comprises genetically diverse, globally distributed lineages with evidence for intra-hospital transmission.",

    "abstract": "Archaeal genomes are densely packed; thus, correct transcription termination is an important factor for orchestrated gene expression. A systematic analysis of RNA 3 termini, to identify transcription termination sites (TTS) using RNAseq data has hitherto only been performed in two archaea. In this study, only part of the genome had been investigated. Here, we developed a novel algorithm that allows an unbiased, genome-wide identification of RNA 3 termini independent of annotation. In an RNA fraction enriched for primary transcripts by terminator exonuclease (TEX) treatment we identified 1,543 RNA 3 termini. A strong sequence signature consistent with known termination events at intergenic loci indicates a clear enrichment for native TTS among them. Using these data we determined distinct putative termination motifs for intergenic (a T stretch) and coding regions (AGATC). In vivo reporter gene tests of selected TTS confirmed termination at these sites, which exemplify the different motifs. For several genes, more than one termination site was detected, resulting in transcripts with different lengths of the 3 untranslated region.",

    "abstract": "Event Related Potentials (ERPs) are widely used to study category-selective EEG responses to visual stimuli, such as the face-selective N170 component. Typically, this is done by flashing stimuli abruptly at the point of static gaze fixation. While allowing for good experimental control, these paradigms ignore the dynamic role of eye-movements in natural vision. Fixation-related potentials (FRPs) obtained using simultaneous EEG and eye-tracking, overcome this limitation. Various studies have used FRPs to study processes such as lexical processing, target detection and attention allocation. The goal of this study was to compare face-sensitive activity evoked by stimulus abrupt appearance with that evoked by self-controlled gaze fixations on a stimulus. Twelve participants were studied in three experimental conditions: Free-viewing (FRPs), Cued-viewing (FRPs) and Control (ERPs). We used a multiple regression approach to disentangle overlapping activity components. Our results show that the N170 face effect (face vs. non-face) is evident for the first fixation on a stimulus, whether it follows a self-generated saccade or stimulus appearance at fixation point. Furthermore, the N170 exhibits category-specific adaptation in free viewing. The N170 face effect had similar topography across viewing conditions, but there were major differences within each stimulus category. We ascribe these differences to an overlap of the fixation-related Lambda response and the N170. We tested the plausibility of this account using dipole simulations. This study establishes the use of the N170 face effect as a signature of face detection in free-viewing experiments while highlighting the importance of accounting for eye-movement related effects.",

    "abstract": "Non-cortical visual areas in vertebrate brains extract different stimulus features, such as motion, object size and location, to support behavioural tasks. The optic tectum and pretectum, two primary visual areas, are thought to fulfil complementary biological functions in zebrafish to support prey capture and optomotor stabilisation behaviour. However, the adaptations of these brain areas to behaviourally relevant stimulus statistics are unknown. Here, we used calcium imaging to characterize the receptive fields of 1,926 motion-sensitive neurons in diencephalon and midbrain. We show that many caudal pretectal neurons have large receptive fields (RFs), whereas RFs of tectal neurons are smaller and mostly size-selective. RF centres of large-size RF neurons in the pretectum are predominantly located in the lower visual field, while tectal neurons sample the upper-nasal visual field more densely. This tectal visual field sampling matches the expected prey item locations, suggesting that the tectal magnification of the upper-nasal visual field might be an adaptation to hunting behaviour. Finally, we probed optomotor responsiveness and found that even relatively small stimuli drive optomotor swimming, if presented in the lower-temporal visual field, suggesting that the pretectum preferably samples information from this region on the ground to inform optomotor behaviour. Our characterization of the parallel processing channels for non-cortical motion feature extraction provides a basis for further investigation into the sensorimotor transformations of the zebrafish brain and its adaptations to habitat and lifestyle.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and characterized by tau hyperphosphorylation, oxidative stress, reactive microglia and amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) deposits. A recent study revealed that Porphyromonas gingivalis infection is associated with amyloid {beta} generation in Alzheimers disease. Increased A{beta} levels, tau degradation and neuronal toxicity were observed as a consequence of ginigipain R (RgpB) activity, a cysteine protease constitutively secreted by P. gingivalis. Of note, we previously identified RgpB as a potent activator of the metalloproteinase meprin {beta}. Interestingly, meprin {beta} is an alternative {beta}-secretase of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which together with the {gamma}-secretase leads to the generation of aggregation-prone N-terminally truncated A{beta}2-x peptides. Importantly, identification of a risk gene variant of meprin {beta} (rs173032) for Alzheimers disease using whole-exome sequencing of the BDR cohort further supports the impact of this alternative {beta}-secretase. Thus, we wondered if increased A{beta} levels as a consequence of P. gingivalis colonization into the brain might be due to meprin {beta} activation by RgpB. Here, we demonstrate that i) upon incubation with RgpB the proteolytic activity of meprin {beta} at the cell surface of transfected HEK cells or of endogenously expressed enzyme in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells was significantly increased, and that ii) RgpB-mediated increase in meprin {beta} activity leads to massive generation of A{beta}-peptides. In conclusion, our findings would further explain the pathogenesis of P. gingivalis in AD brain.",

    "abstract": "Public involvement is key to closing the gap between research production and research use, and the only way to achieving ultimate transparency in science. The majority of life science research is not public-facing, but is funded by the public and impacts the community. We undertook a survey of researchers within the life sciences to better understand their views and perceived challenges to involving the public in their research. We had a valid response cohort of n=110 researchers, of whom 90% were primarily laboratory based. Using a mixed methods approach, we demonstrate that a top-down approach is key to motivate progression of life scientists from feeling positive towards public involvement to actually engaging in it. Researchers who viewed public involvement as beneficial to their research were more likely to have direct experience of doing it. We demonstrate that the systemic flaws in the way life sciences research enterprise is organised, including the promotion system, hypercompetition, and time pressures are major barriers to involving the public in the scientific process. Scientists are also apprehensive of being involuntarily involved in the current politicized climate, misinformation and publicity hype surrounding science nowadays makes them hesitant to share their early and in-progress research. The time required to deliberate study design and relevance, plan and build relationships for sustained involvement, provide and undertake training, and improve communication in the current research environment is often considered nonpragmatic, particularly for early career researchers. In conclusion, a top-down approach involving institutional incentives and infrastructure appears most effective at transitioning researchers from feeling positive towards public involvement to actually implementing it.",

    "abstract": "Malignant melanoma is characterized by mutations in a number of driver genes, most notably BRAF and NRAS. Recently, genomic analyses revealed that 4-9% of sun-exposed melanoma bear activating mutations in RAC1, which encodes a small GTPase that is known to play key roles in cell proliferation, survival, and migration. The RAC1 protein activates several effector pathways, including Group A p21-activated kinases (PAKs), phosphoinositol-3-kinases (PI3Ks), in particular the beta isoform, and the serum-response factor/myocardin-related transcription factor (SRF/MRTF). Having previously shown that inhibition of Group A PAKs impedes oncogenic signaling from RAC1P29S, we here extend this analysis to examine the roles of PI3Ks and SRF/MITF in melanocytes and/or in a zebrafish model. We demonstrate that a selective Group A PAK inhibitor (Frax-1036) and certain PI3Ks inhibitors (BKM120, TGX221, GSK2636771) impede the growth of melanoma cells driven by mutant RAC1 but not mutant BRAF, however other PI3K inhibitors, including PI3K-selective inhibitors are less effective. Similar results were seen in vivo, using embryonic zebrafish development as a readout, but now including an SRF/MRTF inhibitor (CCG-203971). These results suggest that targeting Group A PAKs and/or SRF/MRTF represent promising approach to suppress RAC1 signaling in malignant melanoma.",

    "abstract": "Isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDH) are involved in redox control and central metabolism. Mutations in IDH induce epigenetic and transcriptional reprogramming, differentiation bias, BCL-2 dependence and susceptibility to mitochondrial inhibitors in cancer cells. Here we show that high sensitivity to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPHOS) inhibitors is due to an enhanced mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in cell lines, PDX and patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) harboring IDH mutation. Along with an increase in TCA cycle intermediates, this AML-specific metabolic behavior mechanistically occurs through the increase in methylation-driven CEBP- and CPT1a-induced fatty acid oxidation, electron transport chain complex I activity and mitochondrial respiration in IDH1 mutant AML. Furthermore, an IDH mutant inhibitor that significantly and systematically reduces 2-HG oncometabolite transiently reverses mitochondrial FAO and OxPHOS gene signature and activities in patients who responded to the treatment and achieved the remission. However, at relapse or in patients who did not respond, IDH mutant inhibitor failed to block these mitochondrial properties. Accordingly, OxPHOS inhibitors such as IACS-010759 improve anti-AML efficacy of IDH mutant inhibitors alone and in combination with chemotherapy in vivo. This work provides a scientific rationale for combinatory mitochondrial-targeted therapies to treat IDH mutant-positive AML patients, especially those unresponsive to or relapsing from IDH mutant-specific inhibitors.",

Two dominant (Xa4 and Xa21) and two recessive (xa5 and xa13) BLB resistance genes were introgressed into a Malaysian elite rice variety Putra-1 with genetic background of three blast resistance (Piz, Pi2 and Pi9) genes and high yielding. Eight polymorphic tightly linked functional and SSR markers were used for foreground selection of target genes. 79 polymorphic SSR markers were used in background selection. The plants were challenged at initial stage of breeding and challenged again at BC2F2 with the most virulent Malaysian pathotypes of Xoo (P7.7) and Magnaporthe oryzae (P7.2) to test their resistance. Results obtained from foreground marker analysis showed that the BC1F1 and BC2F1 both fitted into the Mendels single gene segregation ratio of 1:1 for both Xoo and blast resistance. At BC2F2, result obtained indicated that foreground marker segregation fitted into the expected Mendelian ratio of 1:2:1 for blast resistance only. Marker-assisted background selection revealed high percentage of recurrent parent genome recovery (95.9%). It was concluded that resistance to Xoo pathotype P7.7 in IRBB60 was neither due to two independent gene action nor epistasis but substantially due to single nuclear gene action. Also, the inheritance of blast resistance in the pyramided lines to pathotype P7.2 was also attributed to single gene action. The incorporation of four bacterial leaf blight and three blast resistance genes (Xa4+xa5+xa13+Xa21+Pi9+Pi2+Piz) in the newly developed lines provides for broad spectrum and durable resistance against the two major diseases studied.",

In this study, we used optical coherence tomography (OCT) to measure the severity and timing of retrograde degeneration after post-chiasmal visual pathway lesions in patients with homonymous hemianopia. We performed a retrospective study of 69 patients with homonymous hemianopia and analyzed high quality OCT macular ganglion cell complex (GCC) and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). Patients with lesions involving the optic tract and thalamus were included in the anterior group, while patients with lesions of the occipital lobe were included in the posterior group. Statistical significance was determined using Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon test. We found that in patients with homonymous hemianopia, those with anterior lesion exhibited earlier and more severe thinning compared with the posterior group. In fact, thinning can occur within 2 months after insult in the anterior group. Within 6 months of onset, the anterior group exhibited about 5 times more hemi-macular GCC thinning than those with acquired lesions of the posterior visual pathway (P = 0.0023). Although the severity of hemi-macular GCC thinning was different, the majority of hemi-macular thinning occurred within the first 6 months in both groups. Beyond 2 years, thinning in those with acquired anterior and posterior lesions was minimal, except in a small number of patients with multiple insults to the occipital lobe. In conclusion, using OCT, we measured the severity and rate of long-distance, retrograde degeneration in patients with homonymous hemianopia. Homonymous hemi-macular thinning after optic tract and thalamic injury was more severe and occurred earlier compared with thinning after occipital lobe insult via trans-synaptic degeneration. The presence of severe hemi-macular degeneration on OCT provides objective evidence that localizes the lesion to the post-chiasmal anterior visual pathway.",

    "abstract": "Phosphate acquisition by plants is an essential process that is directly implicated in the optimization of crop yields. Purple acid phosphatases (PAPs) are ubiquitous metalloenzymes, which catalyze the hydrolysis of a wide range of phosphate esters and anhydrides. While some plant PAPs display a preference for ATP as the substrate, others are efficient in hydrolyzing phytate or 2-phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). PAP from red kidney bean (rkbPAP) is an efficient ATP- and ADPase, but has no activity towards phytate. The crystal structure of this enzyme in complex with an ATP analogue (to 2.20 [A] resolution) provides insight into the amino acid residues that play an essential role in binding this substrate. Homology modelling was used to generate three-dimensional structures for the active sites of PAPs from tobacco (NtPAP) and Arabidopsis thaliana (AtPAP12 and AtPAP26) that are efficient in hydrolyzing phytate and PEP as substrates, respectively. In combination with substrate docking simulations and a phylogenetic analysis of 49 plant PAP sequences (including the first PAP sequences reported from Eucalyptus), several active site residues were identified that are important in defining the substrate specificities of plant PAPs. These results may inform bioengineering studies aimed at identifying and incorporating suitable plant PAP genes into crops to improve phosphorus use efficiency. Organic phosphorus sources increasingly supplement or replace inorganic fertilizer, and efficient phosphorus use of crops will lower the environmental footprint of agriculture while enhancing food production.",

    "abstract": "Structure-guided vaccine design provides a route to elicit a focused immune response against the most functionally important regions of a pathogen surface. This can be achieved by identifying epitopes for neutralizing antibodies through structural methods and recapitulating these epitopes by grafting their core structural features onto smaller scaffolds. In this study, we have conducted a modified version of this protocol. We focused on the PfEMP1 protein family found on the surfaces of erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium falciparum. A subset of PfEMP1 proteins bind to endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), and their expression correlates with development of the symptoms of severe malaria. Structural studies revealed the PfEMP1 to present a helix-kinked-helix motif which forms the core of the EPCR binding site. Using Rosetta-based design we successfully grafted this motif onto a three-helical bundle scaffold. We show that this synthetic binder interacts with EPCR with nanomolar affinity and adopts the expected structure. We also assessed its ability to bind to antibodies found in immunized animals and in humans from malaria endemic regions. Finally, we tested its capacity to effectively elicit antibodies that prevent EPCR binding and analysed the degree of cross-reactivity of these antibodies across a diverse repertoire of EPCR-binding PfEMP1. This provides a case study of immunogen design, assessing the effect of designing a focused immunogen that contains the core features of a ligand binding site, rather than those of a neutralizing antibody epitope.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSeveral studies have been conducted to compare the use DBS as alternative to plasma specimens, but mainly using Whatman 903(R) cards as filter paper. The aim of this study was to evaluate Whatman FTA(R) cards (FTA cards) specimens for HIV-1 viral load testing by comparing it to plasma specimens, using 2 real-Time PCR assays.\\n\\nMethodologyA cross-sectional study was conducted between April 2017 and September 2017, in HIV-1 patients admitted at Yalgado Ouedraogo teaching hospital. Paired FTA cards and plasma specimens were collected and analyzed using Abbott RealTime HIV-1 assay (Abbott) and COBAS(R) AmpliPrep/COBAS(R) TaqMan v2.0 (Roche), following manufacturers protocol.\\n\\nResultsA total of 107 patients were included. No Statistical differences (p-value > 0.05) were observed between the mean viral loads obtained from FTA cards and plasma specimens with Roche and Abbott assays. Twenty-nine samples with Roche and 15 samples with Abbott assay showed discrepant results. At viral loads of [&le;]1000 copies/mL, the sensitivity and specificity of FTA cards were 78.6%, and 100% with Roche, and 92.3% and 95.9% with Abbott. Strong correlation was found between FTA cards and plasma specimens with both assays. With Roche, Bland-Altman analysis showed bias of -0.3 and 95% limits of agreement of -2.6 to 1.8 log10, with 97/99 cases (97.9%) within agreement limits. With Abbott, Bland-Altman analysis showed bias of -0.1 and 95% limits of agreement of -2.3 to 2.1 log10, with 96/99 cases (96.9%) within agreement limits.\\n\\nConclusionOur study demonstrated the feasibility of using FTA cards filter paper for HIV-1 viral load testing. However, further studies are required for FTA cards filter paper validation in HIV-1 treatment monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer represents the second most common cause of cancer-related death. The human A33 transmembrane glycoprotein is a validated tumor-associated antigen, expressed in 95% of primary and metastatic colorectal cancers. Using phage display technology, we generated a human monoclonal antibody (termed A2) specific to A33 and we compared its epitope and performance to those of previously described clinical-stage anti-human A33 antibodies. All antibodies recognized a similar immunodominant epitope, located in the V-domain of A33, as revealed by SPOT-analysis. The A2 antibody homogenously stained samples of poorly, moderately and well-differentiated colon adenocarcinomas. All antibodies also exhibited an intense staining of healthy human colon sections. The A2 antibody, reformatted in murine IgG2a format, preferentially localized to A33-transfected CT26 murine colon adenocarcinomas in immunocompetent mice with a homogenous distribution within the tumor mass, while other antibodies exhibited a patchy uptake in neoplastic lesions. A2 efficiently induced killing of A33-expressing cells through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro and was able to inhibit the growth of A33-positive murine CT26 and C51 lung metastases in vivo. Anti-A33 antibodies may thus represent useful vehicles for the selective delivery of bioactive payloads to colorectal cancer, or may be used in IgG format in settings of minimal residual disease.",

    "abstract": "Hibernation consists of extended durations of torpor interrupted by periodic arousals. The  dehydration hypothesis proposes that hibernating mammals arouse to replenish water lost through evaporation during torpor. Arousals are energetically expensive, and increased arousal frequency can alter survival throughout hibernation. Yet we lack a means to assess the effect of evaporative water loss (EWL), determined by animal physiology and hibernation microclimate, on torpor bout duration and subsequent survival. White-nose syndrome (WNS), a devastating disease impacting hibernating bats, causes increased frequency of arousals during hibernation and EWL has been hypothesized to contribute to this increased arousal frequency. WNS is caused by a fungus, which grows well in humid hibernaculum environments and damages wing tissue important for water conservation. Here, we integrated the effect of EWL on torpor expression in a hibernation energetics model, including the effects of fungal infection, to determine the link between EWL and survival. We collected field data for Myotis lucifugus, a species that experiences high mortality from WNS, to gather parameters for the model. In saturating conditions we predicted healthy bats experience minimal mortality. Infected bats, however, suffer high fungal growth in highly saturated environments, leading to exhaustion of fat stores before spring. Our results suggest that host adaptation to humid environments leads to increased arousal frequency from infection, which drives mortality across hibernaculum conditions. Our modified hibernation model provides a tool to assess the interplay between host physiology, hibernaculum microclimate, and diseases such as WNS on winter survival.",

The reported retention at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months were 90.7%, 78.1%, 68.8% and 64.4%, respectively. We report findings of a follow up evaluation for the 2012-2015 cohorts to assess the implementation & impact of recommendations from this prior evaluation.\\n\\nMethodsA nationwide retrospective study was conducted in 2016. Multi-stage proportional sampling was used to select health facilities and study participants records. The data extracted from patient manual records included demographic, baseline clinical characteristics and patient outcomes (active on treatment, died, transferred out, stopped ART and lost to follow-up (LFTU)) at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months. The data were analysed using Stata/IC 14.2. Retention was estimated using survival analysis. The predictors associated with attrition were determined using a multivariate Cox regression model.\\n\\nResultsA total of 3,810 participants were recruited in the study. The median age in years was 35 (IQR: 28-42). Overall, retention increased to 92.4%, 86.5%, 79.2% and 74.4% at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months respectively. LFTU accounted for 98% of attrition. Being an adolescent or a young adult (aHR 1.41; 95%CI:1.14-1.74), receiving care at primary health care facility (aHR 1.23; 95%CI:1.01-1.49), having initiated ART between 2014-2015 (aHR 1.45; 95%CI:1.24-1.69), having WHO Stage 4 (aHR 2.06; 95%CI:1.51-2.81) and impaired functional status (aHR 1.24; 95%CI:1.04-1.49) predicted attrition.\\n\\nConclusionThe overall retention was higher in comparison to the previous 2007--2010 evaluation. Further studies to understand why attrition was found to be higher at primary health care facilities are warranted. Implementation of strategies for managing patients with advanced HIV disease, differentiated care for adolescents and young adults and tracking of LFTU should be prioritised to further improve retention.",

    "abstract": "Ultra-high field functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has allowed us to acquire images with submillimetre voxels. However, in order to interpret the data clearly, we need to accurately correct head motion and the resultant distortions. Here, we present a novel application of Boundary Based Registration (BBR) to realign functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data and evaluate its effectiveness on a set of 7T submillimetre data, as well as millimetre 3T data for comparison. BBR utilizes the boundary information from high contrast present in structural data to drive registration of functional data to the structural data. In our application, we realign each functional volume individually to the structural data, effectively realigning them to each other. In addition, this realignment method removes the need for a secondary aligning of functional data to structural data for purposes such as laminar segmentation or registration to data from other scanners. We demonstrate that BBR realignment outperforms standard realignment methods across a variety of data analysis methods. Further analysis shows that this benefit is an inherent property of the BBR cost function and not due to the difference in target volume. Our results show that BBR realignment is able to accurately correct head motion in 7T data and can be utilized in preprocessing pipelines to improve the quality of 7T data.",

Disease-associated gene regulations were overall different from aging gene regulations.

    "abstract": "Domestication of crops and animals during the Holocene epoch played a critical role in shaping human culture, diet and genetic variation. This domestication process took place across a span of time and space, especially in Asia. We hypothesize that domestication of plants and animals around the world must have influenced the human genome differentially among human populations to a far greater degree than has been appreciated previously. The range of domesticated foods that were available in different regions can be expected to have created regionally distinct nutrient intake profiles and deficiencies. To capture this complexity, we used archaeobotanical evidence to construct two models of dietary nutrient composition over a 9000 year time span in Asia: one based on Larson et al. (2014) and measured through composition of 8 nutrients, and another taking into account a wider range of crops, cooking and lifestyle variation, and the dietary variables glycemic index and carbohydrate content. We hypothesize that the subtle dietary shifts through time and space have also influenced current human genetic variation among Asians. We used statistical methods BayeScEnv, BayeScan and Baypass, to examine the impact of our reconstructed long-term dietary habits on genome-wide genetic variation in 29 current-day Asian populations (Figure S1, Figure 1, Figure 2). Our results show that genetic variation in diet-related pathways is correlated with dietary differences among Asian populations. SNPs in five genes, GHR, LAMA1, SEMA3A, CAST and TCF7L2, involved in the gene ontologies  salivary gland morphogenesis and  negative regulation of type B pancreatic cell apoptotic process suggest that metabolism may have been primary targets of selection driven by dietary shifts. These shifts may have influenced biological pathways in ways that have a lasting impact on health. We present a case that archaeobotanical evidence can provide valuable insight for understanding how historical human niche construction might have influenced modern human genetic variation.\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=119 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/747709v1_fig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (26K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1aa917corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@135990forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d3e0d3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14d5112_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 1.C_FLOATNO Organization of the study and analysis pipeline.

    "abstract": "The disease scald of barley is caused by the pathogen Rhynchosporium commune and can cause up to 30-40% yield loss in susceptible varieties. In this study, the Australian barley cultivar Yerong was demonstrated to have resistance that differed from Turk (Rrs1) based on seedling tests with 11 R. commune isolates. A doubled haploid population with 177 lines derived from a cross between Yerong and Franklin was used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for scald resistance. Scald resistance against four pathogen isolates was assessed at the seedling growth stage in a glasshouse experiment and at the adult growth stage in field experiments with natural infection over three consecutive years. A QTL on chromosome 3H was identified with large effect, consistent with a major gene conferring scald resistance at the seedling stage. Under field conditions, scald percentage was negatively correlated with early relative maturity. A bivariate analysis was used to model scald percentage and relative maturity together, residuals from the regression of scald percentage on relative maturity were used as our phenotype for QTL analysis. This analysis identified one major QTL on chromosome 3H, which mapped to the same position as the QTL identified for scald resistance at seedling stage. The identified QTL on 3H is proposed to be different from the Rrs1 on the basis of seedling resistance against different R. commune isolates and physical map position. The analysis also identified an additional novel QTL on chromosome 7H. This study increases the current understanding of scald resistance and identifies genetic material possessing QTLs useful for the marker-assisted selection of scald resistance in barley breeding programs.",

    "abstract": "In the cereal crop sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) inflorescence morphology variation underlies yield variation and confers adaptation across precipitation gradients, but its genetic basis is poorly understood. Here we characterized the genetic architecture of sorghum inflorescence morphology using a global nested association mapping (NAM) population (2200 recombinant inbred lines) and 198,000 phenotypic observations from multi-environment trials for four inflorescence morphology traits (upper branch length, lower branch length, rachis length, and rachis diameter). Trait correlations suggest that lower and upper branch length are under largely independent genetic control, while lower branch length and rachis diameter are pleiotropic. Joint linkage and genome-wide association mapping revealed an oligogenic architecture with 1-22 QTL per trait, each explaining 0.1%-5.0% of variation across the entire NAM population. Overall, there is a significant enrichment (2.4-fold) of QTL colocalizing with homologs of grass inflorescence genes, notably with orthologs of maize (Ramosa2) and rice (Aberrant Panicle Organization1, TAWAWA1) inflorescence regulators. In global georeferenced germplasm, allelic variation at the major inflorescence morphology QTL is significantly associated with precipitation gradients, consistent with a role for these QTL in adaptation to agroclimatic zones. The findings suggest that global inflorescence diversity in sorghum is largely controlled by oligogenic, epistatic, and pleiotropic variation in ancestral regulatory networks. This genotype-phenotype trait dissection in global germplasm provides a basis for genomics-enabled breeding of locally-adapted inflorescence morphology.",

    "abstract": "The nematode Halicephalobus mephisto was originally discovered inhabiting a deep terrestrial aquifer 1.3 km underground. H. mephisto can thrive under conditions of abiotic stress including heat and minimal oxygen, where it feeds on a community of both chemolithotrophic and heterotrophic prokaryotes in an unusual ecosystem isolated from the surface biosphere. Here we report the comprehensive genome and transcriptome of this organism, identifying a signature of adaptation: an expanded repertoire of 70 kilodalton heat-shock proteins (Hsp70) and avrRpt2 induced gene 1 (AIG1) proteins. We find that positive selection has driven the expansion of Hsp70 genes, which are also transcriptionally induced upon growth under heat stress. We further show that AIG1 may have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from a rhizobial fungus. Over one-third of the genes of H. mephisto are novel, highlighting the divergence of this nematode from other sequenced organisms. This work sheds light on the genomic strategies of adaptation to heat in the first complete subterrestrial eukaryotic genome.",

    "abstract": "The putative methyltransferase LaeA is a global regulator of metabolic and development processes in filamentous fungi. We characterized the homologous laeA genes of the white koji fungus Aspergillus luchuensis mut. kawachii (A. kawachii) to determine their role in the hyperproduction of citric acid. The {Delta}laeA strain exhibited a significant reduction in citric acid productivity. Cap-analysis gene expression (CAGE) revealed that laeA is required for the gene expression of a putative citrate exporter encoding cexA, which is critical for citric acid production. The deficit in the productivity of citric acid by the {Delta}laeA strain was rescued by the overexpression of cexA to a level comparable with that of the cexA-overexpressing {Delta}cexA strain. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) analysis indicated that LaeA regulates the expression of cexA via methylation levels of the histones H3K4 and H3K9. These results indicate that LaeA is involved in citric acid production through epigenetic regulation of cexA in A. kawachii.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEA. kawachii has been traditionally used for production of the distilled spirit shochu in Japan. Citric acid produced by A. kawachii plays an important role in preventing microbial contamination during the shochu fermentation process. This study characterized homologous laeA genes; using CAGE, complementation test, and ChIP-qPCR, it was found that laeA is required for citric acid production though regulation of cexA in A. kawachii. The epigenetic regulation of citrate production elucidated in this study will be useful for controlling the fermentation processes of shochu.",

    "abstract": "Cystinosis, a genetic rare disease characterized by cystine accumulation and crystallization, results in significant damage in a multitude of tissues and organs, such as the kidney, thyroid, eye, and brain. While Cystinosis impact on brain function is relatively mild compared to its effects on other organs, the increased lifespan of this population and thus potential for productive societal contributions have led to increased interest on the effects on brain function. Nevertheless, and despite some evidence of structural brain differences, the neural impact of the mutation is still not well characterized.\\n\\nHere, using a passive duration oddball paradigm (with different stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs), representing different levels of demand on memory) and high-density electrophysiology, we tested basic auditory processing in a group of 22 children and adolescents diagnosed with Cystinosis (age range: 6-17 years old) and in neurotypical age-matched controls (N=24). We examined whether the N1 and mismatch negativity (MMN) significantly differed between the groups and if those neural measures correlated with verbal and non-verbal IQ. Individuals diagnosed with Cystinosis presented similar N1 responses to their age-matched peers, indicating typical basic auditory processing in this population. However, whereas both groups showed similar MMN responses for the shortest (450ms) SOA, suggesting intact change detection and sensory memory, individuals diagnosed with Cystinosis presented clearly reduced responses for the longer (900ms and 1800ms) SOAs. This could indicate reduced duration auditory sensory memory traces, and thus sensory memory impairment, in children and adolescents diagnosed with Cystinosis. Future work addressing other aspects of sensory and working memory is needed to understand the underlying bases of the differences described here, and their implication for higher order processing.",

    "abstract": "We describe our connectomics pipeline for processing tracer injection data for the brain of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Brain sections were imaged using a batch slide scanner (NanoZoomer 2.0-HT) and we used artificial intelligence to precisely segment the anterograde tracer signal from the background in the fluorescence images. The shape of each brain was reconstructed by reference to a block-face and all data was mapped into a common 3D brain space with atlas and 2D cortical flat map. To overcome the effect of using a single template atlas to specify cortical boundaries, each brain was cytoarchitectonically annotated and used for making an individual 3D atlas. Registration between the individual and common brain cortical boundaries in the flat map space was done to absorb the variation of each brain and precisely map all tracer injection data into one cortical brain space. We describe the methodology of our pipeline and analyze tracer segmentation and brain registration accuracy. Results show our pipeline can successfully process and normalize tracer injection experiments into a common space, making it suitable for large-scale connectomics studies with a focus on the cerebral cortex.",
