    "abstract": "Parthenogenesis is a biological process of asexual reproduction. Recent studies have highlighted the significance of this fascinating phenomenon in the vertebrate evolution. Although parthenogenetic reproduction appears to be widespread among reptiles, a restricted number of cases were reported in captivity and wild. Here, we studied and reported an intriguing case of a 20-year old captive female Cuban boa (Chilabothrus angulifer), from the Zoo da Maia (Maia, Portugal) collection, isolated from conspecifics males, that gave birth twice in 4 years. The neonates from both deliveries, one fresh and the other fixed in formalin, were submitted to histopathological and molecular genetic analysis. Both neonates were homozygous for the loci analyzed, carrying only mother alleles. Furthermore, morphological abnormalities (anophthalmia) were observed in the second neonate. Our data support a pattern of parthenogenetic reproduction. This is the first documented case of facultative parthenogenesis in a Cuban boa, which can be of great interest for further research on ecology, evolution, captive breeding and conservation of the species.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) continues to cause zoonotic infections and serious disease, primarily in the Arabian Peninsula, due to repeated spill-over from dromedary camels and subsequent nosocomial transmission. Approved MERS vaccines for use in animals or humans are not currently available. MERS-CoV replication requires the virus-encoded papain-like protease (PLpro) to cleave multiple sites in the viral replicase polyproteins, thereby releasing functional non-structural proteins. Additionally, PLpro is a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) that can remove ubiquitin(-like) moieties from substrates, presumably to counteract host antiviral responses. In previous work, we determined the crystal structure of MERS-CoV PLpro in complex with ubiquitin, facilitating the design of PLpro mutations that impair DUB activity without affecting viral polyprotein cleavage. Here, we introduced these DUB-inactivating mutations into the viral genome and examined their impact on MERS-CoV infection both in cell culture and in a lethal mouse model. Although overall replication of DUB-negative and wild-type (wt) recombinant MERS-CoV was comparable in multiple cell lines, infection with DUB-negative virus markedly increased mRNA levels for interferon (IFN)-{beta} and IFN-stimulated genes. Moreover, compared to a wt virus infection, the survival rate was significantly increased when DUB-negative MERS-CoV was used to infect transgenic mice expressing a human MERS-CoV receptor. Interestingly, DUB-negative and wt MERS-CoV replicated to the same titers in lungs of infected mice, but the DUB-negative virus was cleared faster, likely due to the observed accelerated and better-regulated innate immune responses, in contrast to delayed and subsequently excessive responses in wt virus-infected mice. This study provides the first direct evidence that the DUB activity of a coronaviral protease contributes to innate immune evasion and can profoundly enhance virulence in an animal model. Thus, reduction or removal of the innate immune-suppressive DUB activity of PLpros is a promising strategy for coronavirus attenuation in the context of rational vaccine development.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAlthough zoonotic coronaviruses such as Middle East respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have pandemic potential, therapeutics and vaccines that counteract this public health threat are not currently available. Coronaviruses typically employ multiple strategies to evade the hosts innate immune response, which may enhance clinical disease and/or reduce the efficacy of modified live vaccines. The MERS-CoV-encoded papain-like protease (PLpro) is not only crucial for the expression of functional replicase proteins, but has also been postulated to antagonize ubiquitination-dependent steps during the activation of the innate immune response. Here, we report the generation of engineered MERS-CoVs mutants in which PLpros deubiquitinating (DUB) activity was specifically disrupted without affecting virus viability. In this manner, we could demonstrate that the DUB activity of PLpro suppresses the interferon response in MERS-CoV-infected cells. Strikingly, in the lungs of mice infected with DUB-negative MERS-CoV, innate immune responses were induced at an earlier stage of infection than in wt virus-infected mice. This group also showed a clearly increased survival, indicating that the DUB activity is an important MERS-CoV virulence factor. This proof-of-concept study establishes that the engineering of DUB-negative coronaviruses, which elicit a more effective immune response in the host, is a viable strategy for vaccine development.",

    "abstract": "Posttranscriptional regulation plays a fundamental role in the biology of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Many studies have demonstrated that multiple mRNAs are coregulated by one or more RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that orchestrate the expression of these molecules. A family of RBPs, known as PUF (Pumilio-FBF), is highly conserved among species and has been associated with the undifferentiated and differentiated states of different cell lines. In humans, two homologs of the PUF family have been found: Pumilio 1 (PUM1) and Pumilio 2 (PUM2). To understand the role of these proteins in human ESCs (hESCs), we first demonstrated the influence of the silencing of PUM1 and PUM2 on pluripotency genes. OCT4 and NANOG mRNA levels decreased significantly with the knockdown of Pumilio, suggesting that PUMILIO proteins play a role in the maintenance of pluripotency in hESCs. Furthermore, we observed that the hESCs silenced for PUM1 and 2 exhibited an improvement in efficiency of in vitro cardiomyogenic differentiation. Using in silico analysis, we identified mRNA targets of PUM1 and PUM2 expressed during cardiomyogenesis. With the reduction of PUM1 and 2, these target mRNAs would be active and could be involved in the progression of cardiomyogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disease which is associated to a progressive skeletical muscle degeneration. Swimming is usually indicated for avoiding impact and facilitating adherence because of a better adaptation to a warm water invironment and also for its benefits on cognition, and modulating memory and learning processes and for increasing antioxidant defenses in oxidative stress. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of a swimming protocol on memory and oxidative stress in an animal model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Methods: male mdx and wild type mice within 28 days were used in this study. The animals were trained in an stepped swimming protocol for four consecutive weeks. Twenty four hours after the last exercise day, aversive memory and habituation memory tests were performed and removed the encephalic structures of striatus, pre frontal cortex, hippocampus, and cortex and gastrocnemius and diafragma muscles to evaluate protein carbonilation and lipid peroxidation and free thiols. Results: it was verified that swimming was able to reduce significantly the levels of lipid peroxidation and protein carbonilation in gastrocnemius and hippocampus and striatus in exercised animals. Swimming has also prevented lipid peroxidation in diafragma. Besides, this swimming protocol was able to increase free thiols in gastrocnemius, diafragma and in analysed SNC structures. These results showed that swimming prevented aversive and habituation memory in mdx mice.",

    "abstract": "Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a devastating disease in small grain cereals worldwide. The disease results in the reduction of grain yield and affects its quality. In addition, mycotoxins accumulated in grain are harmful to both humans and animals. It has been reported that response to pathogen infection may be associated with the morphological and developmental characteristics of the host plant, e.g. the earliness and plant height. Despite the many studies the effective markers for the selection of barley genotypes with increased resistance to FHB have not thus far been developed. Therefore, exploring the genetic relationship between agronomic traits (e.g. heading date or stem height) and disease resistance is of importance to the understanding of plant resistance via \\\"diesease escape\\\" or dwarf stature. The studied plant material consisted of 100 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) of spring barley. Plants were examined in field conditions (three locations) in a completely randomized design with three replications. Barley genotypes were artificially infected with spores of Fusarium before heading. Apart from the main phenotypic traits (plant height, spike characteristic, grain yield) the infected kernels were visually scored and the content of deoxynivalenol (DON) mycotoxin was investigated. A set of 70 Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) were detected through phenotyping of the mapping population in field condition and genotyping using a barley Ilumina iSelect platform with 9K markers. Six loci were detected for FHB index on chromosomes 2H, 3H, 5H and 7H. The region on the short arm of the 2H chromosome was detected in the current study, in which many QTLs associated with FHB- and yield-related characters were found. This study confirms that agromorphological traits are tightly related to the FHB and should be taken into consideration when breeding barley plants for FHB resistance.",

In Africa, hypertension is the leading driver of cardiovascular disease and stroke deaths. Identification of critical risk factors of hypertension can help formulate targeted public health programmes and policies aimed at reducing the prevalence and its associated morbidity, disability and mortality. This study attempts to develop multilevel regression, an in-depth statistical model to identify critical risk factors of hypertension.\\n\\nMethodsThis study used data on 4381 individuals aged [&ge;]18 years from the nationally representative World Health Organization Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) Ghana Wave 2. Multilevel regression modelling was employed to identify critical risk factors for hypertension based on systolic blood pressure (SBP) (i.e. SBP>140mmHg).\\n\\nResultsThe data on 4381 individuals were analysed out of which 27.3% were hypertensive. Critical risk factors for hypertension identified were age, obesity, marital status, health state and difficulty with self-care. Strong unobserved household-level residual variations were found.\\n\\nConclusionHypertension remains high in Ghana. Addressing the problem of obesity, targeting specific interventions to those aged over 50 years, and improvement in the general health of Ghanaians are paramount to reducing the prevalence and its associated morbidity, disability and mortality.

    "abstract": "Mechanical overloading is a major cause of tendinopathy, but the underlying pathogenesis of tendinopathy is unclear. Here we report that high mobility group box1 (HMGB1) is released to the tendon extracellular matrix and initiates an inflammatory cascade in response to mechanical overloading in a mouse model. Moreover, administration of glycyrrhizin (GL), a naturally occurring triterpene and a specific inhibitor of HMGB1, the tendons inflammatory reactions. Also, while prolonged mechanical overloading in the form of long-term intensive treadmill running induces Achilles tendinopathy in mice, administration of GL completely blocks the tendinopathy development. Additionally, mechanical overloading of tendon cells in vitro induces HMGB1 release to the extracellular milieu, thereby eliciting inflammatory and catabolic responses as marked by increased production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) in tendon cells. Application of GL abolishes the cellular inflammatory/catabolic responses. Collectively, these findings point to HMGB1 as a key molecule that is responsible for the induction of tendinopathy due to mechanical overloading placed on the tendon.",

This study aimed to estimate the burden of CL and MCL in Ecuador for the period 2014-2018, in order to inform decision-making and resource allocation to tackle this neglected disease.\\n\\nMethodsAmbulatory consultations, hospitalizations, and reported cases of Leishmaniasis registered by the Ecuadorian National Institute of Statistics and Census and the Ministry of Public Health were used to estimate the burden of CL and MCL during a five-year period. Case estimations were stratified by prevalence of acute and long-term sequelae, to calculate Years Lived with Disability (YLD) by sex and age group using the DALY package in R. Spatial analysis was conducted to identify statistically significant spatial clusters of leishmaniasis.\\n\\nResultsBetween years 2014 and 2018, a total 6,937 cases of leishmaniasis were registered, with an average of 1,395 cases reported per year, 97.5% of them were CL and 2.5% MCL. The average cumulative incidence for the study period corrected for underreporting was estimated in 21.98 to 36.10 per 100 thousand inhabitants. Health losses due to leishmaniasis reach 0.32 DALY per 100,000 people per year (95% CI 0.15 - 0.49). The most affected by the disease were men between 15 to 64 years old living below 1,500 m.a.s.l. in sub-tropical and tropical rural communities on both slopes of the Andes mountains. Cantons with the highest cumulative incidence of CL and MCL were Pedro Vicente Maldonado, San Miguel de Los Bancos, and Puerto Quito, in the Pichincha Province; Taisha and Aguarico in the Morona Santiago and Orellana provinces respectively.\\n\\nConclusionCompared to previous reports, in the past five years CL and MCL persist as a public health problem in Ecuador. There is a need for more comprehensive and robust data sources to track leishmania cases in Ecuador.\\n\\nAuthor summaryCutaneous (CL) and mucocutaneous (MCL) leishmaniasis remains as an endemic neglected tropical disease in several Latin American countries, including Ecuador. Both CL and MCL can produce disfiguring lesions on exposed parts of the body like face and extremities, and permanent scars, contributing to the burden of the disease due to stigma. In order to inform health authorities in their efforts to improve the control of the transmission of the Leishmaniases in the Ecuadorian population, we estimate the burden of CL and MCL for Ecuador in the period 2014-2018, calculating the years lived with disability due to acute and chronic sequelae. We also look for geographical regions within Ecuador with significant clusters of people with the disease, and we found 17 spatial clusters in sub-tropical and tropical rural communities below 1,500 m.a.s.l. on both slopes of the Andes mountains.",
