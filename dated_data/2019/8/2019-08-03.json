    "abstract": "The retina is a highly specialized neural tissue that senses light and initiates image processing. Although the functional organisation of specific cells within the retina has been well-studied, the molecular profile of many cell types remains unclear in humans. To comprehensively profile cell types in the human retina, we performed single cell RNA-sequencing on 20,009 cells obtained post-mortem from three donors and compiled a reference transcriptome atlas. Using unsupervised clustering analysis, we identified 18 transcriptionally distinct clusters representing all known retinal cells: rod photoreceptors, cone photoreceptors, Muller glia cells, bipolar cells, amacrine cells, retinal ganglion cells, horizontal cells, retinal astrocytes and microglia. Notably, our data captured molecular profiles for healthy and early degenerating rod photoreceptors, and revealed a novel role of MALAT1 in putative rod degeneration. We also demonstrated the use of this retina transcriptome atlas to benchmark pluripotent stem cell-derived cone photoreceptors and an adult Muller glia cell line. This work provides an important reference with unprecedented insights into the transcriptional landscape of human retinal cells, which is fundamental to our understanding of retinal biology and disease.",

    "abstract": "In the model organism Escherichia coli, helix distorting lesions are recognized by the UvrAB damage surveillance complex in the global genomic nucleotide excision repair pathway (GGR). Alternately, during transcription-coupled repair (TCR), UvrA is recruited to Mfd at sites of RNA polymerases stalled or paused by lesions. Ultimately, damage recognition is mediated by UvrA, culminating in the loading of the damage verification enzyme UvrB. We set out to characterize the differences in the kinetics of interactions of UvrA with Mfd and UvrB. We followed functional, fluorescently tagged UvrA molecules in live cells and measured their residence times in TCR-deficient or wild-type cells. We demonstrate that the lifetimes of UvrA in Mfd-dependent or Mfd-independent interactions in the absence of exogenous DNA damage are comparable in live cells, and are governed by UvrB. Upon UV irradiation, we found that the lifetimes of UvrA strongly depended on, and matched those of Mfd. Here, we illustrate a non-perturbative, imaging-based approach to quantify the kinetic signatures of damage recognition enzymes participating in multiple pathways in cells.",

    "abstract": "Tendons hierarchical structure allows for load transfer between its fibrillar elements at multiple length scales. Tendon microstructure is particularly important, because it includes the cells and their surrounding collagen fibrils, where mechanical interactions can have potentially important physiological and pathological contributions. However, the three-dimensional microstructure and the mechanisms of load transfer in that length scale are not known. It has been postulated that interfibrillar matrix shear or direct load transfer via the fusion/branching of small fibrils are responsible for load transfer, but the significance of these mechanisms is still unclear. Alternatively, the helical fibrils that occur at the microstructural scale in tendon may also mediate load transfer, however, these structures are not well studied due to the lack of a three-dimensional visualization of tendon microstructure. In this study, we used serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) to investigate the threedimensional microstructure of fibrils in rat tail tendon. We found that tendon fibrils have a complex architecture with many helically wrapped fibrils. We studied the mechanical implications of these helical structures using finite element modeling and found that frictional contact between helical fibrils can induce load transfer even in the absence of matrix bonding or fibril fusion/branching. This study is significant in that it provides a three-dimensional view of the tendon microstructure and suggests friction between helically wrapped fibrils as a mechanism for load transfer, which is an important aspect of tendon biomechanics.",

    "abstract": "There are many enzymes that are relevant for making rare and valuable chemicals that while active, are severely limited by thermodynamic, kinetic, or stability issues (e.g. isomerases, lyases, transglycosidase etc.). In this work, we study an enzymatic reaction system - Lactobacillus sakei L-arabinose isomerase (LsLAI) for D-galactose to D-tagatose isomerization - that is limited by all three reaction parameters. The enzyme has a low catalytic efficiency for non-natural substrate galactose, has low thermal stability at temperatures > 40 {degrees}C, and equilibrium conversion < 50%. After exploring several strategies to overcome these limitations, we finally show that encapsulating the enzyme in a gram-positive bacterium (Lactobacillus plantarum) that is chemically permeabilized can enable reactions at high rates, high conversion, and at high temperatures. The modified whole cell system stabilizes the enzyme, differentially partitions substrate and product across the membrane to shift the equilibrium toward product formation enables rapid transport of substrate and product for fast kinetics. In a batch process, this system enables approximately 50 % conversion in 4 h starting with 300 mM galactose (an average productivity of 37 mM/h), and 85 % conversion in 48 h, which are the highest reported for food-safe mesophilic tagatose synthesis. We suggest that such an approach may be invaluable for other enzymatic processes that are similarly kinetically-, thermodynamically-, and/or stability-limited.",

    "abstract": "Oncogenesis rewires signaling networks to confer a fitness advantage to malignant cells. For instance, the B16F0 melanoma cell model creates a cytokine sink for Interleukin-12 (IL-12) to deprive neighboring cells of this important anti-tumor immune signal. While a cytokine sink provides an indirect fitness advantage, does IL-12 provide an intrinsic advantage to B16F0 cells? Functionally, stimulation with IL-12 enhanced B16F0 cell survival but not normal Melan-A melanocytes that were challenged with a cytotoxic agent. To identify a mechanism, we assayed the phosphorylation of proteins involved in canonical IL-12 signaling, STAT4, and cell survival, Akt. In contrast to T cells that exhibited a canonical response to IL-12 by phosphorylating STAT4, IL-12 stimulation of B16F0 cells predominantly phosphorylated Akt. Mechanistically, the differential response in B16F0 cells is explained by both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent aspects to initiate PI3K-AKT signaling upon IL12RB2 homodimerization. Namely, IL-12 promotes IL12RB2 homodimerization with low affinity and IL12RB2 overexpression promotes homodimerization via molecular crowding on the plasma membrane. Collectively, the data suggest that B16F0 cells shifted the intra-cellular response to IL-12 from engaging immune surveillance to favoring cell survival. Identifying how signaling networks are rewired in model systems of spontaneous origin can inspire therapeutic strategies in humans.\n\nStatement of SignificanceWhile Interleukin-12 is a key cytokine that promotes anti-tumor immunity, thinking of cancer as an evolutionary process implies that an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment could arise during oncogenesis by interfering with endogenous anti-tumor immune signals, like IL-12. Previously, we found that B16F0 cells, a cell line derived from a spontaneous melanoma, interrupts this heterocellular signal by sequestering IL-12, which provides an indirect fitness advantage. Here, we report that B16F0 cells gain an intrinsic advantage by rewiring the canonical response to IL-12 to instead initiate PI3K-AKT signaling, which promotes cell survival. The data suggest a model where overexpressing one component of the IL-12 receptor, IL12RB2, enables melanoma cells to shift the functional response via both IL-12-mediated and molecular crowding-based IL12RB2 homodimerization.",

Multiple signals from the microenvironment have been reported to drive EMT. However, microenvironment signals that control EMT and promote MET are still unknown. Here, we analysed a regulatory network of EMT involving 8 microenvironment signals to evaluate the role of cell contact signals on the switching between Epithelial and Mesenchymal-like phenotypes. The results demonstrated that RPTP activation by cell contacts have the potential to control EMT and promote MET in the presence of 5 EMT driving signals under physiological scenarios. These simulations also showed that hypoxia inhibits the RPTPs capacity of controlling EMT. In this case, FAT4 activation by cell contacts functions as an alternative control mechanism of EMT except under chronic inflammation, providing a theoretical explanation for the observed correlation between hypoxia and metastasis under chronic inflammation. Taken together, we propose here a natural control mechanism of EMT that supports the idea that this process is tightly regulated by the microenvironment.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LICell contact dependent RPTP inhibit EMT and triggers MET in the presence of 5 EMT driving signals in silico.\\nC_LIO_LIA proposed molecular mechanism for the control of EMT by cell contact dependent RPTPs.\\nC_LIO_LIA proposed explanation for the observed MET in vitro and the correlation between hypoxia and metastasis in vivo.\\nC_LI",

In our experiments, we bound motor effort to such switching behavior during a two-alternative perceptual decision-making task and recorded the sampling patterns by computer mouse cursor tracking. We found that the time and motor cost to make the decision positively correlated with the number of switches between the stimuli and increased with the difficulty of the task. Specifically, the first and last sampled items were chosen in an attempt to minimize the overall motor effort during the task and were manipulable by biasing the relevant motor cost. Moreover, we observed the last-sampling bias that the last sampled item was more likely to be chosen by the subjects. We listed all possible Bayesian Network models for different hypotheses regarding the causal relationship behind the last-sampling bias, and only the model assuming bidirectional dependency between attention and decision successfully predicted the empirical results. Meanwhile, denying that the current decision variable can feedback into the attention switching patterns during sampling, the conventional attentional drift-diffusion model (aDDM) was inadequate to explain the size of the last-sampling bias in our experimental conditions. We concluded that the sampling behavior during perceptual decision-making actively adapted to the motor effort in the specific task settings, as well as the temporary decision.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has prompted the use of two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) with genetic variants as instrumental variables (IV) for drawing reliable causal relationships between health risk factors and disease outcomes. However, the unique features of GWAS demand that MR methods account for both linkage disequilibrium (LD) and ubiquitously existing horizontal pleiotropy among complex traits, which is the phenomenon wherein a variant affects the outcome through mechanisms other than exclusively through the exposure. Therefore, statistical methods that fail to consider LD and horizontal pleiotropy can lead to biased estimates and false-positive causal relationships. To overcome these limitations, we propose a probabilistic model for MR analysis to identify the casual effects between risk factors and disease outcomes using GWAS summary statistics in the presence of LD and to properly account for horizontal pleiotropy among genetic variants (MR-LDP). MR-LDP utilizes a computationally efficient parameter-expanded variational Bayes expectation-maximization (PX-VBEM) algorithm to estimate the parameter of interest and further calibrates the evidence lower bound (ELBO) for a likelihood ratio test. We then conducted comprehensive simulation studies to demonstrate the advantages of MR-LDP over the existing methods in terms of both type-I error control and point estimates. Moreover, we used two real exposure-outcome pairs (CAD-CAD and Height-Height; CAD for coronary artery disease) to validate the results from MR-LDP compared with alternative methods, showing that our method is more efficient in using all instrumental variants in LD. By further applying MR-LDP to lipid traits and body mass index (BMI) as risk factors for complex diseases, we identified multiple pairs of significant causal relationships, including a protective effect of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) on peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a positive causal effect of body mass index (BMI) on hemorrhoids.",

It is still poorly understood whether a link between neuronal IFs and mitochondrial mobility exist. In C. elegans, among the 11 cytoplasmic IF family proteins, IFB-1 is of particular interest as it is expressed in a subset of sensory neurons. Depletion of IFB-1 leads to mild dye-filling and significant chemotaxis defects as well as reduced life span. Sensory neuron development is affected and mitochondria transport is slowed down leading to reduced densities of these organelles. Mitochondria tend to cluster in neurons of IFB-1 mutants likely dependent on fission but independent of fusion events. Oxygen consumption and mitochondrial membrane potential is measurably reduced in worms carrying mutations in the ifb-1 gene. Membrane potential also seems to play a role in transport such as FCCP treatment led to increased directional switching of mitochondria. Mitochondria colocalize with IFB-1 in worm neurons and appear in a complex with IFB-1 in pull-down assays. In summary, we propose a model in which neuronal intermediate filaments may serve as critical (transient) anchor points for mitochondria during their long-range transport in neurons for steady and balanced transport.\n\nAbstract Figure\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=117 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/723205v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c6fc73org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e7fd9aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ba9742org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@20a9ed_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG SynopsisVarious neurological diseases are both associated with abnormal accumulations of neuronal intermediate filaments as well as mitochondria.

Such pleiotropic fitness effects determine the evolutionary fate of the population in variable environments and can lead to ecological specialization. It is unclear how the pleiotropic outcomes of evolution are shaped by the intrinsic randomness of the evolutionary process and by the deterministic variation in selection pressures across environments. To address this question, we evolved 20 replicate populations of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in 11 laboratory environments and measured their fitness across multiple other conditions. We found that evolution in all home environments led to a diversity of patterns of pleiotropic fitness gains and losses, driven by multiple types of mutations. Approximately 60% percent of this variation are explained by clones home environment and the most common parallel genetic changes, while about 40% are attributed to the stochastic accumulation of mutations whose pleiotropic effects are unpredictable. On average, populations specialized to their home environment, but generalists also evolved in almost all conditions. Our results suggest that the mutations accumulating in a home environment incur a variety of pleiotropic effects, from costs to benefits, with different probabilities. Therefore, whether a population evolves towards a specialist or a generalist phenotype is heavily influenced by chance.",

How they do so is a topic of debate. We propose a view of visual cortex in which average neural response strength encodes stimulus features, while cross-neuron variability in response gain encodes the uncertainty of these features. To test our theory, we studied spiking activity of neurons in macaque V1 and V2 elicited by repeated presentations of stimuli whose uncertainty was manipulated in distinct ways. We show that gain variability of individual neurons is tuned to stimulus uncertainty, that this tuning is invariant to the source of uncertainty, and that it is specific to the features encoded by these neurons. We demonstrate that this behavior naturally arises from known gain-control mechanisms, and derive how downstream circuits can jointly decode stimulus features and their uncertainty from sensory population activity.",

    "abstract": "Drawing is a powerful tool that can be used to convey rich perceptual information about objects in the world. What are the neural mechanisms that enable us to produce a recognizable drawing of an object, and how does this visual production experience influence how this object is represented in the brain? Here we evaluate the hypothesis that producing and recognizing an object recruit a shared neural representation, such that repeatedly drawing the object can enhance its perceptual discriminability in the brain. We scanned participants using fMRI across three phases of a training study: during training, participants repeatedly drew two objects in an alternating sequence on an MR-compatible tablet; before and after training, they viewed these and two other control objects, allowing us to measure the neural representation of each object in visual cortex. We found that: (1) stimulus-evoked representations of objects in visual cortex are recruited during visually cued production of drawings of these objects, even throughout the period when the object cue is no longer present; (2) the object currently being drawn is prioritized in visual cortex during drawing production, while other repeatedly drawn objects are suppressed; and (3) patterns of connectivity between regions in occipital and parietal cortex supported enhanced decoding of the currently drawn object across the training phase, suggesting a potential substrate for learning how to transform perceptual representations into representational actions. Taken together, our study provides novel insight into the functional relationship between visual production and recognition in the brain.\\n\\nSignificance StatementHumans can produce simple line drawings that capture rich information about their perceptual experiences. However, the mechanisms that support this behavior are not well understood. Here we investigate how regions in visual cortex participate in the recognition of an object and the production of a drawing of it. We find that these regions carry diagnostic information about an object in a similar format both during recognition and production, and that practice drawing an object enhances transmission of information about it to downstream regions. Taken together, our study provides novel insight into the functional relationship between visual production and recognition in the brain.",

    "abstract": "The ability to fully discern how the brain orchestrates behavior requires the development of successful computational approaches to integrate and inform in-vivo investigations of the nervous system. To effectively assist with such investigations, computational approaches must be generic, scalable and unbiased. We propose such a comprehensive framework to investigate the interaction between the nervous system and the body for the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Specifically, we introduce a model that computationally emulates the activity of the complete somatic nervous system and its response to stimuli. The model builds upon the full anatomical wiring diagram, the connectome, and integrates it with additional layers including intra-cellular and extra-cellular bio-physically relevant neural dynamics, layers translating neural activity to muscle forces and muscle impulses to body postures. In addition, it implements inverse integration which modulates neural dynamics according to external forces on the body. We validate the model by in-silico injection of currents into sensory- and inter-neurons known to play a role in locomotion behaviors (e.g. posterior/anterior touch) and by applying external forces on the body. We are able to generate characteristic baseline locomotion behaviors (forward and backward movements). Inclusion of proprioceptive feedback, implemented through inverse integration, shows that feedback can entrain and sustain movements initiated by neural or mechanical triggers. We further apply neural stimuli, experimentally known to modulate locomotion, and show that our model supports natural behavioral responses such as turns, reversals and avoidance. The proposed model can be utilized to infer neural circuits involved in sensorimotor behavior. For this purpose, we develop large-scale computational ablation approaches such as (i) ablation survey and (ii) conditional ablation. Our results show how an ablation survey can identify neurons required for a ventral turning behavior. We also show how conditional ablation can identify alternative novel neural pathways, e.g. propose neurons which facilitate steering behavior towards olfactory attractants. The outcomes of our study show that the framework can be utilized to identify neural circuits, which control, mediate and generate natural behavior.",

    "abstract": "The control of locomotion is fundamental to vertebrate animal survival. Defensive situations require an animal to rapidly decide whether to run away or suppress locomotor activity to avoid detection. While much of the neural circuitry involved in defensive action selection has been elucidated, top-down modulation of brainstem locomotor circuitry remains unclear. Here we provide evidence for the existence and functionality of a monosynaptic connection from the central amygdala (CeA) to the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) that inhibits locomotion in unconditioned and conditioned defensive behavior in mice. We show that locomotion stimulated by airpuff coincides with increased activity of MLR glutamatergic neurons. Using retrograde tracing and ex vivo electrophysiology, we find that the CeA makes a monosynaptic connection with the MLR. In the open field, in vivo stimulation of this projection suppressed spontaneous locomotion, whereas inhibition of this projection had no effect. However, inhibiting CeA terminals within the MLR increased both neural activity and locomotor responses to airpuff. Finally, using a conditioned avoidance paradigm known to activate CeA neurons, we find that inhibition of the CeA projection increased successful escape, whereas activating the projection reduced escape. Together these results provide evidence for a new circuit substrate influencing locomotion and defensive behaviors.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlzheimers disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly population. Currently, no effective cure is available for AD. According to the amyloid hypothesis, the accumulation and deposition of the amyloid-beta (A{beta}) peptides plays a key role in AD pathology. Soluble A{beta} (sA{beta}) oligomers were shown to be synaptotoxic and involved in pathological hypersynchronisation of brain resting-state networks in different transgenic developmental-onset mouse models of amyloidosis. However, the impact of protein overexpression during brain postnatal development may cause additional phenotypes unrelated to AD. To address this concern, we investigated sA{beta} effects on functional resting-state networks in transgenic mature-onset amyloidosis Tet-Off APP (TG) mice.\\n\\nMethodsTG mice and control littermates were raised on doxycycline (DOX) diet from 3d up to 3m of age to suppress transgenic A{beta} production. Thereafter, longitudinal resting-state functional MRI was performed on a 9.4T MR-system starting from week 0 (3m old mice) up to 28w post DOX treatment. Ex vivo immunohistochemistry and ELISA analysis (additional mice cohort) was performed to address the development of amyloid pathology.\\n\\nResultsFunctional Connectivity (FC) analysis demonstrated early abnormal hypersynchronisation in the TG mice compared to the controls at 8w post DOX treatment. This effect was observed particularly across regions of the default mode-like network, known to be affected in AD. Ex vivo analyses performed at this time point confirmed a 20-fold increase in total sA{beta} levels and the absence of A{beta} plaques in the TG mice compared to the controls. On the contrary at week 28, TG mice showed an overall hypoconnectivity, coinciding with a widespread deposition of A{beta} plaques in the brain.\\n\\nConclusionsBy preventing developmental influence of APP and/or sA{beta} during brain postnatal development, we demonstrated FC abnormalities driven by sA{beta} synaptotoxicity on resting state neuronal networks in mature-induced TG mice. Thus, the Tet-Off APP mouse model could be a powerful tool while used as a mature-onset model to shed light into amyloidosis mechanisms in AD. Therefore, this inducible APP expression model used in combination with early non-invasive in vivo rsfMRI readout for sA{beta} synaptotoxicity sets the stage for future A{beta} targeting preventative treatment studies.",

    "abstract": "We developed a neural network model that can account for the major elements common to human focal seizures. These include the tonic-clonic transition, slow advance of clinical semiology and corresponding seizure territory expansion, widespread EEG synchronization, and slowing of the ictal rhythm as the seizure approaches termination. These were reproduced by incorporating usage-dependent exhaustion of inhibition in an adaptive neural network that receives global feedback inhibition in addition to local recurrent projections. Our model proposes mechanisms that may underline common EEG seizure onset patterns and status epilepticus and postulates a role for synaptic plasticity in emergence of epileptic foci. Complex patterns of seizure activity and bi-stable seizure evolution end-points arise when stochastic noise is included. With the rapid advancement of clinical and experimental tools, we believe that this can provide a roadmap and potentially a testbed for future explorations of seizure mechanisms and clinical therapies.",

    "abstract": "During central nervous system (CNS) development, spatiotemporal gene expression programs mediate specific lineage decisions to generate neuronal and glial cell types from neural stem cells (NSCs). However, little is known about the epigenetic landscape underlying these highly complex developmental events. Here, we perform ChIP-seq on distinct subtypes of Drosophila FACS-purified neural stem cells (NSCs) and their differentiated progeny to dissect the epigenetic changes accompanying the major lineage decisions in vivo. By analyzing active and repressive histone modifications, we show that stem cell identity genes are silenced during differentiation by loss of their activating marks and not via repressive histone modifications. Our analysis also uncovers a new set of genes specifically required for altering lineage patterns in type II neuroblasts, one of the two main Drosophila NSC identities. Finally, we demonstrate that this subtype specification in NBs, unlike NSC differentiation, requires Polycomb-group (PcG)-mediated repression.\\n\\nSummary statementDynamic epigenetic landscape of Drosophila neural stem cell lineages.",
