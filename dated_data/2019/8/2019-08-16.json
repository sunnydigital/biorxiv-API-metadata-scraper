    "abstract": "Clinic-close methods are not available that prioritize and validate potential therapeutic targets in individual tumors from the vast bulk of descriptive expression data. We developed a novel technique to express transgenes in established patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models in vivo to fill this gap. With this technique at hand, we analyzed the role of transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) PDX models at different disease stages. In competitive pre-clinical in vivo trials, we found that re-expression of wild type KLF4 reduced leukemia load in PDX models of B-ALL, with strongest effects after conventional chemotherapy at minimal residual disease (MRD). A non-functional KLF4 mutant had no effect in this model. Re-expressing KLF4 sensitized tumor cells in the PDX model towards systemic chemotherapy in vivo. Of major translational relevance, Azacitidine upregulated KLF4 levels in the PDX model and a KLF4 knockout reduced Azacitidine-induced cell death, suggesting that Azacitidine can regulate KLF4 re-expression. These results support applying Azacitidine in patients with B-ALL to regulated KLF4 as a therapeutic option. Taken together, our novel technique allows studying the function of dysregulated genes in a highly clinic-related, translational context and testing clinically applicable drugs in a relevant pre-clinical model.",

    "abstract": "Scatter-hoarding animals cannot physically protect individual caches, and instead utilize several behavioral strategies that are hypothesized to offer protection for caches. We validated the use of physically altered, cacheable food items, and determined that intraspecific pilfering among free-ranging fox squirrels (N = 23) could be assessed in the field. In this study we were able to identify specific individual squirrels who pilfered or moved caches that had been stored by a conspecific. We identified a high level of pilfering (25%) among this population. In a subsequent study, we assessed the fate of squirrel-made caches. Nineteen fox squirrels cached 294 hazelnuts with passive integrated transponder tags implanted in them. Variables collected included assessment and cache investment and protection behaviors; cache location, substrate, and conspicuousness of each cache; how long each cache remained in its original location, and the location where the cache was finally consumed. We also examined whether assessment or cache protection behaviors were related to the outcomes of buried nuts. Finally, we measured the population dynamics and heterogeneity of squirrels in this study, testing the hypothesis that cache proximity and pilferage tolerance could serve as a form of kin selection. Polymer chain reaction (PCR) was used to analyze hair samples and determine relatedness among 15 squirrels, and the potential impact of relatedness on caching behavior. Results suggested that cache protection behaviors and the lifespan of a cache were dependent on the conspicuousness of a cache. Squirrels may mitigate some of the costs of pilfering by caching closer to the caches of related squirrels than to those of non-related squirrels.",

We show that this ingredient is in fact crucial for the interpretation of molecular biology results. It is correlated to the degree of chromatin loosening measured by DNA accessibility, and systematically leads to cellular dedifferentiation as assessed by transcriptomic signatures, irrespective of the molecular and cellular tools used. A theoretical analysis of gene circuits formally involved in differentiation, reveals that the epigenetic landscapes of Waddington are restructured by the level of non-specific expression, such that the attractors of progenitor and differentiated cells can be mutually exclusive. Together, these results unveil a generic principle of epigenetic landscape remodeling in which the basal gene expression level, notoriously important in pluripotent cells, allows the maintenance of stemness by generating a specific landscape and in turn, its reduction favors multistability and thereby differentiation. This study highlights how heterochromatin maintenance is essential for preventing pathological cellular reprogramming, age-related diseases and cancer.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTPrimary neurulation is the process by which the neural tube, the central nervous system precursor, is formed from the neural plate. Incomplete neural tube closure occurs frequently, yet underlying causes remain poorly understood. Developmental studies in amniotes and amphibians have identified hingepoint and neural fold formation as key morphogenetic events and hallmarks of primary neurulation, the disruption of which causes neural tube defects. In contrast, the mode of neurulation in teleosts such as zebrafish has remained highly debated. Teleosts are thought to have evolved a unique pattern of neurulation, whereby the neural plate infolds in absence of hingepoints and neural folds (NFs), at least in the hindbrain/trunk where it has been studied. We report here on zebrafish forebrain morphogenesis where we identify these morphological landmarks. Our findings reveal a deeper level of conservation of neurulation than previously recognized and establish the zebrafish as a model to understand human neural tube development.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "New ways of curbing the ability of bacteria to evolve spontaneous resistance could mitigate the looming antibiotic resistance crisis. Progress toward this goal requires a comprehensive understanding of the key factors that contribute to resistance evolvability. Here, we present a systematic approach to identify cellular functions that affect the evolvability of resistance. Using a robotic lab-evolution platform that keeps population size and selection pressure under tight control for hundreds of Escherichia coli populations evolving in parallel, we quantified the effects of a genome-wide selection of pre-existing gene deletions on resistance evolution. Initial resistance of strains with gene deletions differed by more than tenfold but converged toward a hard upper bound for resistance during the evolution experiment, reflecting a global pattern of diminishing returns epistasis. We identified specific cellular functions that drastically curtail the evolvability of resistance; beyond DNA repair, these include membrane transport, LPS biosynthesis, and chaperones. Perturbations of efflux pumps prevented resistance evolution completely or forced evolution on inferior mutational paths, not explored in the wild type. We show that strong negative epistasis generally underlies these phenomena. The identified functions provide new targets for adjuvants tailored to block evolutionary paths to resistance when combined with antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining the identity of chromatin states requires mechanisms that ensure their structural integrity through the concerted actions of histone modifiers, readers, and erasers. Histone H3K9me and H3K27me are hallmarks of repressed heterochromatin, whereas H3K4me and H3K36me are associated with actively transcribed euchromatin. Paradoxically, several studies have reported that loss of Set2, the methyltransferase responsible for H3K36me, causes de-repression of heterochromatin. Here we show that unconstrained activity of the acetyltransferase complex Mst2C, which antagonizes heterochromatin, is the main cause of the silencing defects observed in Set2-deficient cells. As previously shown, Mst2C is sequestered to actively transcribed chromatin via binding to H3K36me3 that is recognized by the PWWP domain protein Pdp3. We demonstrate that combining deletions of set2+ and pdp3+ results in an epistatic silencing phenotype. In contrast, deleting mst2+, or other members of Mst2C, fully restores silencing in Set2-deficient cells. Suppression of the silencing defect in set2{Delta} cells is specific for pericentromeres and subtelomeres, which are marked by H3K9me, but not seen for loci that lack genuine heterochromatin. Although Mst2 catalyzes acetylation of H3K14, this modification is likely not involved in the Set2-dependent pathway due to redundancy with the HAT Gcn5. Moreover, while Mst2 is required for acetylation of the H2B ubiquitin ligase Brl1 in euchromatin, we find that its role in heterochromatin silencing is not affected by Brl1 acetylation. We propose that it targets another, unknown substrate critical for heterochromatin silencing. Our findings demonstrate that maintenance of chromatin states requires spatial constraint of opposing chromatin activities.",

However, gray matter myelination patterns are different, with sparsely myelinated sections leaving large portions of the axons naked. The consequences of this patchy myelination for oligodendrocyte function are not understood but suggest other roles in information processing beyond the regulation of axonal conduction velocity. Here, we analyzed the contribution of myelin to auditory information processing using paradigms that are good predictors of speech understanding in humans. We compared mice with different degrees of dysmyelination using acute cortical multiunit recordings in combination with behavioral readouts. We identified complex alterations of neuronal responses that reflect fatigue and temporal acuity deficits. Partially discriminable but overall similar deficits were observed in mice with oligodendrocytes that can myelinate but cannot fully support axons metabolically. Thus, myelination contributes to sustained stimulus perception in temporally complex paradigms, revealing a role of oligodendrocytes in the CNS beyond the increase of axonal conduction velocity.",

We sought to elucidate the functional impact of L6CT projections from primary visual cortex to visual thalamic nuclei dLGN (first-order) and pulvinar (higher-order) using optogenetics and extracellular electrophysiology in awake mice. While sustained L6CT photostimulation suppresses activity in both visual thalamic nuclei in vivo, moderate-frequency (10Hz) stimulation powerfully facilitates thalamic spiking. We show that each stimulation paradigm differentially influences the balance between monosynaptic excitatory and disynaptic inhibitory corticothalamic pathways to dLGN and pulvinar as well as the prevalence of burst versus tonic firing. Altogether, our results support a model in which L6CTs modulate first- and higher-order thalamus through parallel excitatory and inhibitory pathways that are highly dynamic and context-dependent.\n\nSignificanceLayer 6 corticothalamic (L6CT) projections play important modulatory roles in thalamic processing, yet how this modulation is executed is unclear. While some studies suggest fundamentally inhibitory influence of L6CTs over first-order thalamus, potential complex, frequency-dependent effects have not been investigated in vivo. Moreover, how L6CTs affect higher-order nuclei in vivo has not been explored. This study utilizes various optogenetic manipulations of L6CTs with single-unit recordings from multiple thalamic nuclei in awake mice to address these questions. Our results illustrate similar effects of L6CTs on first- and higher-order visual thalamic nuclei, yet very different effects within-nucleus depending on how L6CTs are engaged. These findings suggest that L6CT modulation is not simply inhibitory by nature, but instead is dynamic and context-dependent.",

We uncover that endogenous or exogenous formate induces a metabolic switch from low to high adenine nucleotide levels, increasing the rate of glycolysis and repressing the AMPK activity. Formate also induces an increase in the pyrimidine precursor orotate and the urea cycle intermediate argininosuccinate, in agreement with the ATP dependent activities of carbamoyl-phosphate and argininosuccinate synthetase. In vivo data for mouse and human cancers confirms the association between increased formate production, nucleotide and energy metabolism. Finally, the in vitro observations are recapitulated in mice following intraperitoneal injection of formate.

To better understand structural birth defects, it is important that we learn how these processes are controlled. Here, we examine this question during chick head morphogenesis using time-lapse imaging, computational modeling, and experiment. We find that head mesodermal cells are inherently dynamic in culture and alter cell behaviors in the presence of either ectoderm or neural crest cells. Mesodermal cells in vivo display large-scale whirling motions that rapidly transition to lateral, directed movements after neural crest cells emerge. Computer model simulations predict distinct changes in neural crest migration as the spatio-temporal growth profile of the mesoderm is varied. BrdU-labeling and photoconversion combined with cell density measurements then reveal non-uniform mesoderm growth in space and time. Chemical inhibition of head mesoderm proliferation or ablation of premigratory neural crest alters mesoderm growth and neural crest migration, implying a dynamic feedback between tissue growth and neural crest cell signaling to confer robustness to the system.\\n\\nSummary StatementDynamic feedback between tissue growth and neural crest cell migration ensures robust neural crest stream formation and head morphogenesis shown by time-lapse microscopy, mathematical modeling and embryo perturbations.",

    "abstract": "A wide range of differences between the subgenomes, termed as subgenome asymmetry or SA, has been reported in various polyploids and different species seem to have different responses to polyploidization. We compared subgenome differences in gene ratio and relative diversity between artificial and natural genotypes of several allopolyploid species. Surprisingly, consistent differences in neither gene ratio nor relative diversity between the subgenomes were detected between these two types of polyploid genotypes although they differ in times exposed to evolutional selection. As expected, the estimated ratio of retained genes between a subgenome and its diploid donor was invariably higher for the artificial allopolyploid genotypes due likely to the presence of variable genome components (VGC). Clearly, the presence of VGC means that exaggerated differences between a donor and a subgenome in a polyploid are inevitable when random genotypes were used to represent species of either a polyploid or its donors. SA was also detected in genotypes before the completion of the polyploidization events as well as in those which were not formed via polyploidization. Considering that significant changes during and following polyploidization have been detected in previous studies, our results suggest that the influence of VGC needs to be considered in evaluating SA and that diploid donors may define changes in polyploid evolution.",

    "abstract": "The Crp/Fnr family of transcriptional regulators play central roles in transcriptional control of diverse physiological responses. Activation of individual family members is controlled by a surprising diversity of mechanisms tuned to the particular physiological responses or lifestyles that they regulate. MrpC is a Crp/Fnr homolog that plays an essential role in controlling the Myxococcus xanthus developmental program. A long-standing model proposed that MrpC activity is controlled by the Pkn8/Pkn14 serine/threonine kinase cascade which phosphorylates MrpC on threonine residue(s) located in its extreme amino terminus. In this study, we demonstrate that a stretch of consecutive threonine and serine residues, T21 T22 S23 S24, is necessary for MrpC activity by promoting efficient DNA binding. Mass spectrometry analysis indicated the TTSS motif is not directly phosphorylated by Pkn14 in vitro but is necessary for efficient Pkn14-dependent phosphorylation on several residues in the remainder of the protein. Pkn8 and Pkn14 kinase activities do not play obvious roles in controlling MrpC activity in wild type M. xanthus under laboratory conditions, but likely modulate MrpC DNA binding in response to unknown environmental conditions. Interestingly, mutational analysis of the TTSS motif caused non-robust developmental phenotypes, revealing that MrpC plays a role in developmental buffering.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria coordinate cellular behaviors using a cell-cell communication system termed quorum sensing. In Vibrio harveyi, the master quorum sensing transcriptional factor LuxR directly regulates >100 genes in response to changes in population density. Here, we show that LuxR derepresses quorum sensing loci by competing with H-NS, a global transcriptional repressor that oligomerizes on DNA to form filaments and bridges. We first identified H-NS as a repressor of bioluminescence gene expression, for which LuxR is a required activator. In an hns deletion strain, LuxR is no longer necessary for transcription activation of the bioluminescence genes, suggesting that the primary role of LuxR is to displace H-NS to derepress gene expression. Using RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, we determined that H-NS and LuxR co-regulate and co-occupy 28 promoters driving expression of 63 genes across the genome. ChIP-PCR assays show that as autoinducer concentration increases, LuxR protein accumulates at co-occupied promoters while H-NS protein disperses. LuxR is sufficient to evict H-NS from promoter DNA in vitro, which is dependent on LuxR DNA binding activity. From these findings, we propose a model in which LuxR serves as a counter-silencer at H-NS-repressed quorum sensing loci by disrupting H-NS nucleoprotein complexes that block transcription.",

    "abstract": "The investigational drugs E7820, indisulam and tasisulam (aryl-sulfonamides) promote the degradation of the splicing factor RBM39 in a proteasome-dependent mechanism. While the activity critically depends on the Cullin RING ligase substrate receptor DCAF15, the molecular details remain elusive. Here we present the cryo-EM structure of the DDB1-DCAF15-DDA1 core ligase complex bound to RBM39 and E7820 at 4.4 [A] resolution, together with crystal structures of engineered subcomplexes. We show that DCAF15 adopts a novel fold stabilized by DDA1, and that extensive protein-protein contacts between the ligase and substrate mitigate low affinity interactions between aryl-sulfonamides and DCAF15. Our data demonstrates how aryl-sulfonamides neo-functionalize a shallow, non-conserved pocket on DCAF15 to selectively bind and degrade RBM39 and the closely related splicing factor RBM23 without the requirement for a high affinity ligand, which has broad implications for the de novo discovery of molecular glue degraders.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factor autoregulation is a simple network motif (recurring circuit) built into genetic regulatory networks that direct cell behavior. Negative autoregulation (NAR) network motifs are particularly abundant in bacteria and provide specific functions, such as buffering against transcriptional noise. Here, we investigate the phenotypic consequence of perturbing NAR of a major transcription factor, MrpC, that controls the multicellular development program of the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus. Launch of the developmental program directs certain cells in the population to first aggregate into haystack-shaped mounds, and then to differentiate into environmentally resistant spores to form mature fruiting bodies. Perturbation of MrpC NAR causes a striking phenotype in which cells lose synchronized transition from aggregation to sporulation. Instead, some cells abruptly exit aggregation centers and remain locked in a cohesive swarming state, while the remaining cells transition to spores inside residual fruiting bodies. As predicted, disruption of MrpC NAR led to an increased and broadened population distribution of mrpC expression. Examination of MrpC levels in developmental subpopulations during in situ development demonstrated cells locked in the swarms contained intermediate MrpC levels insufficient to promote sporulation. These results suggest an inherent property of NAR motifs that function in multicellular developmental programs is to facilitate synchronized responses.\n\nSignificance StatementAll organisms use regulatory networks for cellular homeostasis, mediating appropriate responses to environmental changes, or to direct animal development. Understanding how the basic building blocks (motifs) of regulatory networks contribute to these processes is essential to mitigate the effects of mutations in regulatory networks (i.e. cancers) or to synthesize beneficial organisms. In this study, we demonstrate that a common regulatory motif, a transcription factor that represses its own expression, helps synchronize cells that engage in collective behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Imprinted genes are expressed from only one allele in a parent of origin-specific manner. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p57Kip2 (p57) is encoded by an imprinted gene, with the paternal allele being silenced. The possible expression and function of the paternal allele of p57 have remained little studied, however. We now show that the paternal allele of the p57 gene is expressed at a low level in the developing mouse neocortex. Surprisingly, the central nervous system-specific conditional deletion of the paternal allele (pat cKO) at the p57 locus resulted in a marked reduction in brain size. Furthermore, pat cKO gradually reduced the number of neural stem-progenitor cells (NPCs) during neocortical development, and thus reduced the number of upper-layer neurons, which were derived from late-stage NPCs. Our results thus show that the paternal allele of the p57 locus plays a key role in maintenance of NPCs during neocortical development.",

    "abstract": "Homologous recombination (HR) is a DNA repair mechanism that ensures, together with heterochromatin machinery, the proper replication, structure and function of telomeres and centromeres that is essential for the maintenance of genome integrity. Schizosaccharomyces pombe Rrp1 and Rrp2 participate in HR and are orthologues of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Uls1, a SWI2/SNF2 DNA translocase and SUMO-Targeted Ubiquitin Ligase. We show that Rrp1 or Rrp2 upregulation leads to chromosome instability and growth defects. These phenotypes depend on putative DNA translocase activities of Rrp1 and Rrp2. Either Rrp1 or Rrp2 overproduction results in a reduction in global histone levels, suggesting that Rrp1 and Rrp2 may modulate nucleosome dynamics. In addition we show that Rrp2, but not Rrp1, acts at telomeres. We propose that this role depends on the previously described interaction between Rrp2 and Top2. We conclude that Rrp1 and Rrp2 have important roles for centromere and telomere function and maintenance, contributing to the preservation of genome stability during vegetative cell growth.\\n\\nSUMMARY STATEMENTSchizosaccharomyces pombe DNA translocases Rrp1 and Rrp2 modulate centromere and telomere maintenance pathways and dysregulation of their activity leads to genome instability.",
