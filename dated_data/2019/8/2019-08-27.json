    "abstract": "Quantitative studies of cellular morphodynamics rely on extracting leading-edge velocity time-series based on accurate cell segmentation from live cell imaging. However, live cell imaging has numerous challenging issues about accurate edge localization. Here, we develop a deep learning-based pipeline, termed MARS-Net (Multiple-microscopy- type-based Accurate and Robust Segmentation Network), that utilizes transfer learning and the datasets from multiple types of microscopy to localize cell edges with high accuracy, allowing quantitative profiling of cellular morphodynamics. For effective training with the datasets from multiple types of live cell microscopy, we integrated the pretrained VGG-19 encoder with U-Net decoder and added dropout layers. Using this structure, we were able to train one neural network model that can accurately segment various live cell movies from phase contrast, spinning disk confocal, and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopes. Intriguingly, MARS-Net produced more accurate edge localization than the neural network models trained with single microscopy type datasets, whereas the standard U-Net could not increase the overall accuracy. We expect that MARS-Net can accelerate the studies of cellular morphodynamics by providing accurate segmentation of challenging live cell images.",

    "abstract": "Evolved resistance to one antibiotic may be associated with \\\"collateral\\\" sensitivity to other drugs. Here we provide an extensive quantitative characterization of collateral effects in Enterococcus faecalis, a gram-positive opportunistic pathogen. By combining parallel experimental evolution with high-throughput dose-response measurements, we measure phenotypic profiles of collateral sensitivity and resistance for a total of 900 mutant-drug combinations. We find that collateral effects are pervasive but difficult to predict, as independent populations selected by the same drug can exhibit qualitatively different profiles of collateral sensitivity as well as markedly different fitness costs. Using whole-genome sequencing of evolved populations, we identified mutations in a number of known resistance determinants, including mutations in several genes previously linked with collateral sensitivity in other species. While phenotypic drug sensitivity profiles show significant diversity, they cluster into statistically similar groups characterized by selecting drugs with similar mechanisms. To exploit the statistical structure in these resistance profiles, we develop a simple mathematical model based on a stochastic control process and use it to design optimal drug policies that assign a unique drug to every possible resistance profile. Stochastic simulations reveal that these optimal drug policies outperform intuitive cycling protocols by maintaining long-term sensitivity at the expense of short-term periods of high resistance. The approach reveals a new conceptual strategy for mitigating resistance by balancing short-term inhibition of pathogen growth with infrequent use of drugs intended to steer pathogen populations to a more vulnerable future state. Experiments in laboratory populations confirm that model-inspired sequences of four drugs reduce growth and slow adaptation relative to naive protocols involving the drugs alone, in pairwise cycles, or in four-drug uniform cycles.",

However, raw gene expression values have to be normalized for nuisance biological variation and technical covariates, and different normalization strategies can lead to dramatically different results in the downstream study.\n\nResultsWe describe a generalization of SVD-based reconstruction for which the common techniques of whitening, rank-k approximation, and removing the top k principle components are special cases. Our simple three-parameter transformation, DataRemix, can be tuned to reweight the contribution of hidden factors and reveal otherwise hidden biological signals. In particular, we demonstrate that the method can effectively prioritize biological signals over noise without leveraging external dataset-specific knowledge, and can outperform normalization methods that make explicit use of known technical factors. We also show that DataRemix can be efficiently optimized via Thompson Sampling approach, which makes it feasible for computationally expensive objectives such as eQTL analysis. Finally we reanalyze the Depression Gene Networks (DGN) dataset, and we highlight new trans-eQTL networks which were not reported in the initial study.\n\nAvailabilityDataRemix is an R package which is freely available at GitHub (https://github.com/wgmao/DataRemix).\n\nContactmchikina@pitt.edu",

    "abstract": "Recombinations omnipresence in nature is one of the most intriguing problems in evolutionary biology. The question of why recombination exhibits certain general features is no less interesting than that of why it exists at all. One such feature is recombinations fitness dependence (FD). The so far developed population-genetics models have focused on the evolution of FD recombination mainly in haploids, although the empirical evidence for this phenomenon comes mostly from diploids. Using numerical analysis of modifier models for infinite panmictic populations, we show here that FD recombination can be evolutionarily advantageous in diploids subjected to purifying selection. This advantage is associated with benefits from the differential rate of disruption of lower- vs higher-fitness genotypes, that can be manifested in systems with at least three selected loci. We also show that in systems with linked modifier, an additional contribution to the evolutionary advantage of FD recombination may come from fitness-dependence of the intensity of modifier linkage to the selected system, although the contribution of the last effect vanishes with tighter linkage within the selected system. We also show that in systems with three selected loci, FD recombination may give rise to negative crossover interference, which may be beneficial by itself. Yet, the role of such FD-induced crossover interference in the evolutionary advantage of FD recombination is minor. Remarkably, FD recombination was often favored in situations where any constant non-zero recombination was rejected, implying a relaxation of the rather strict constraints on major parameters (e.g., selection intensity and epistasis) required for the evolutionary advantage of non-zero recombination formulated by classical models.",

In vitro, trophoblast cell response to LIF may vary depending on the cell model. Reported differences in the miRNA profile of trophoblastic cells may be responsible for these observations. Therefore, miRNA expression was investigated in four trophoblastic cell lines under LIF stimulation followed by in silico analysis of altered miRNAs and their associated pathways.\\n\\nMethodsLow density TaqMan miRNA assays were used to quantify levels of 762 mature miRNAs under LIF stimulation in three choriocarcinoma-derived (JEG-3, ACH-3P and AC1-M59) and a trophoblast immortalized (HTR-8/SVneo) cell lines. Expression of selected miRNAs was confirmed in primary trophoblast cells and cell lines by qPCR. Targets and associated pathways of the differentially expressed miRNAs were inferred from the miRTarBase followed by a KEGG Pathway Enrichment Analysis. HTR-8/SVneo and JEG-3 cells were transfected with miR-21-mimics and expression of miR-21 targets was assessed by qPCR.\\n\\nResultsA similar number of miRNAs changed in each tested cell line upon LIF stimulation, however, low coincidence of individual miRNA species was observed and occurred more often among choriocarcinoma-derived cells (complete data set at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ under GEO accession number GSE130489). Altered miRNAs were categorized into pathways involved in human diseases, cellular processes and signal transduction. Six cascades were identified as significantly enriched, including JAK/STAT and TGFB-SMAD. Upregulation of miR-21-3p was validated in all cell lines and primary cells and STAT3 was confirmed as its target.\\n\\nDiscussionDissimilar miRNA responses may be involved in differences of LIF effects on trophoblastic cell lines.",

To investigate this divergence we compared the transcriptomes of genetically paired ICM and trophectoderm (TE) samples with three hESC lines: MAN1, HUES3 and HUES7 at similar passage. We generated inferred interactome networks using transcriptomic data unique to the ICM or TE, and defined a hierarchy of modules (highly connected regions with shared function). We compared network properties and the modular hierarchy and show that the three hESCs had limited overlap with ICM specific transcriptome (6%-12%). However this overlap was enriched for network properties related to transcriptional activity in ICM (p=0.016); greatest in MAN1 compared to HUES3 (p=0.048) or HUES7 (p=0.012). The hierarchy of modules in the ICM interactome contained a greater proportion of MAN1 specific gene expression (46%) compared to HUES3 (28%) and HUES7 (25%) (p=9.0x10-4).\n\nThese findings show that traditional methods based on transcriptome overlap are not sufficient to identify divergence of hESCs from ICM.

    "abstract": "The anterior pituitary gland drives a set of highly conserved physiologic processes in mammalian species. These hormonally-controlled processes are central to somatic growth, pubertal transformation, fertility, lactation, and metabolism. Current models, largely built upon candidate gene based immuno-histochemical and mRNA analyses, suggest that each of the seven hormones synthesized by the pituitary is produced by a specific and exclusive cell lineage. However, emerging evidence suggests more complex models of hormone specificity and cell plasticity. Here we have applied massively parallel single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), in conjunction with a set of orthogonal mRNA and protein imaging studies, to systematically map the cellular composition of adult male and female mouse pituitaries at single-cell resolution and in the setting of major physiologic demands. These analyses reveal sex-specific cellular diversity associated with normal pituitary homeostasis, and identify an array of cells with complex complements of hormone-enrichment as well as a series of non-hormone producing interstitial and supporting cell lineages. These scRNA-seq studies identify a major cell population that is characterized by a unique multi-hormone gene expression profile. The detection of dynamic shifts in cellular representations and transcriptome profiles in response to two well-defined physiologic stresses suggests corresponding roles of a number of these clusters in cellular plasticity within the adult pituitary. These studies point to an unanticipated complexity and plasticity in pituitary cellular composition that expands upon current models and concepts of pituitary gene expression and hormone production.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRed Queen dynamics are defined as long term co-evolutionary dynamics, often with oscillations of genotype abundances driven by fluctuating selection in host-parasite systems. Much of our current understanding of these dynamics is based on theoretical concepts explored in mathematical models that are mostly (i) deterministic, inferring an infinite population size and (ii) evolutionary, thus ecological interactions that change population sizes are excluded. Here, we recall the different mathematical approaches used in the current literature on Red Queen dynamics. We then compare models from game theory (evo) and classical theoretical ecology models (eco-evo), that are all derived from individual interactions and are thus intrinsically stochastic. We assess the influence of this stochasticity through the time to the first loss of a genotype within a host or parasite population.\n\nResultsThe time until the first genotype is lost (\"extinction time\"), is shorter when ecological dynamics, in the form of a changing population size, is considered. Furthermore, when individuals compete only locally with other individuals extinction is even faster. On the other hand, evolutionary models with a fixed population size and competition on the scale of the whole population prolong extinction and therefore stabilise the oscillations. The stabilising properties of intraspecific competitions become stronger when population size is increased and the deterministic part of the dynamics gain influence. In general, the loss of genotype diversity can be counteracted with mutations (or recombination), which then allow the populations to recurrently undergo negative frequency-dependent selection dynamics and selective sweeps.\n\nConclusionAlthough the models we investigated are equal in their biological motivation and interpretation, they have diverging mathematical properties both in the derived deterministic dynamics and the derived stochastic dynamics. We find that models that do not consider intraspecific competition and that include ecological dynamics by letting the population size vary, lose genotypes - and thus Red Queen oscillations - faster than models with competition and a fixed population size.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBird plumage exhibits a diversity of colors that serve functional roles ranging from signaling to camouflage and thermoregulation. However, birds must maintain a balance between evolving colorful signals to attract mates, minimizing conspicuousness to predators, and optimizing adaptation to climate conditions. Examining plumage color macroevolution provides a framework for understanding this dynamic interplay over phylogenetic scales. Plumage evolution due to a single overarching process, such as selection, may generate the same macroevolutionary pattern of color variation across all body regions. In contrast, independent processes may partition plumage into sections and produce region-specific patterns. To test these alternative scenarios, we collected color data from museum specimens of an ornate clade of birds, the Australasian lorikeets, using visible-light and UV-light photography, and comparative methods. We predicted that the diversification of homologous feather regions, i.e., patches, known to be involved in sexual signaling (e.g., face) would be less constrained than patches on the back and wings, where new color states may come at the cost of crypsis. Because environmental adaptation may drive evolution towards or away from color states, we tested whether climate more strongly covaried with plumage regions under greater or weaker macroevolutionary constraint.\\n\\nResultsWe found that alternative macroevolutionary models and varying rates best describe color evolution, a pattern consistent with our prediction that different plumage regions evolved in response to independent processes. Modeling plumage regions independently, in functional groups, and all together showed that patches with similar macroevolutionary models clustered together into distinct regions (e.g., head, wing, belly), which suggests that plumage does not evolve as a single trait in this group. Wing patches, which were conserved on a macroevolutionary scale, covaried with climate more strongly than plumage regions (e.g., head), which diversified in a burst.\\n\\nConclusionsOverall, our results support the hypothesis that the extraordinary color diversity in the lorikeets was generated by a mosaic of evolutionary processes acting on plumage region subsets. Partitioning of plumage regions in different parts of the body provides a mechanism that allows birds to evolve bright colors for signaling and remain hidden from predators or adapt to local climatic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Most mammalian neurons have a narrow axon, which constrains the passage of large cargoes such as autophagosomes that can be larger than the axon diameter. Radial axonal expansion must therefore occur to ensure efficient axonal trafficking. In this study we consistently find that the trafficking speed of various large axonal cargoes is significantly slower than that of small ones, and reveal that the transit of diverse-sized cargoes causes an acute, albeit transient axonal radial expansion, which is immediately restored by constitutive contractility. Using live super-resolution microscopy, we demonstrate that actomyosin-II controls axonal radial contractility and local expansion, and that NM-II filaments associate with periodic F-actin rings via their head domains. Pharmacological inhibition of NM-II activity, significantly increases axon diameter by detaching the NM-II from F-actin, and impacts the trafficking speed, directionality, and overall efficiency of long-range retrograde trafficking. Consequently, prolonged disruption of NM-II activity leads to disruption of periodic actin rings and formation of focal axonal swellings, a hallmark of axonal degeneration.\\n\\nSummaryAxonal radial contractility and local expansion control the retrograde trafficking of large cargoes. The periodic actomyosin-II network comprises of NM-II filaments and F-actin rings. Loss of actomyosin-II-mediated radial contractility causes defects in axonal trafficking and stability, leading to degeneration.",

In this study, drug screening was initially performed on monolayer cultures of HepG2 cells, whereas in vivo drug testing was performed on the subcutaneous xenograft mouse model of HepG2 cells in athymic nude mice. Results showed that Artesunate inhibited HepG2 cell growth in vitro, but was ineffective in vivo. Hence, we investigated the difference between in vitro and in vivo settings using this cell-drug combination as a model. Immuno-staining of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) biomarkers showed that -fetoprotein (AFP) was unaffected by Artesunate treatment in vitro or in vivo, suggesting that AFP was neither a biomarker nor response indicator. Alternatively, high albumin was detected in both monolayer and organoid cultures; contrariwise, the xenograft tumors prevailed low albumin, in consistency to human HCC with poor prognosis. Artesunate treatment reduced intracellular albumin expression in vitro; Artesunate did not alter tissue and serum albumin in xenograft mice, in coincidence with its irresponsiveness in vivo. However, Artesunate binding to albumin was undetectable. Instead, we observed a transient stimulation of Erk1/2 phosphorylation followed by DAPK1 dephosphorylation and apoptosis. Combined treatment of Artesunate with U0126 revoked Erk1/2-DAPK1 phosphorylation and exerted modest proliferative advantage at early time points, but eventually did not rescue HepG2 cells from death. U0126 induced multiploid formation independent of Artesunate, resulting in cell cycle arrest within 24 h post-treatment.\\n\\nSignificanceSystematic investigation of HCC biomarkers AFP and albumin among the in vitro models of monolayer and organoid cultures, and the in vivo models of subcutaneous and liver implantation xenograft mice was conducted.",

    "abstract": "Predictions about the effect of natural selection on patterns of linked neutral variation are largely based on models involving the rapid fixation of unconditionally beneficial mutations. However, when phenotypes adapt to a new optimum trait value, the strength of selection on individual mutations decreases as the population adapts. Here, I use explicit forward simulations of a single trait with additive-effect mutations adapting to an optimum shift. Detectable \\\"hitch-hiking\\\" patterns are only apparent if i. the optimum shifts are large with respect to equilibrium variation for the trait, ii. mutation rates to large-effect mutations are low, and iii., large-effect mutations rapidly increase in frequency and eventually reach fixation, which typically occurs after the population reaches the new optimum. For the parameters simulated here, partial sweeps do not appreciably affect patterns of linked variation, even when the mutations are strongly selected. The contribution of new mutations versus standing variation to fixation depends on the mutation rate affecting trait values. Given the fixation of a strongly-selected variant, patterns of hitch-hiking are similar on average for the two classes of sweeps because sweeps from standing variation involving large-effect mutations are rare when the optimum shifts. The distribution of effect sizes of new mutations has little effect on the time to reach the new optimum, but reducing the mutational variance increases the magnitude of hitch-hiking patterns. In general, populations reach the new optimum prior to the completion of any sweeps, and the times to fixation are longer for this model than for standard models of directional selection. The long fixation times are due to a combination of declining selection pressures during adaptation and the possibility of interference among weakly selected sites for traits with high mutation rates.",

    "abstract": "Long-read sequencing technologies allow the systematic interrogation of transcriptomes from any species. However, functional characterization requires the determination of the correct 5-to-3 orientation of reads. Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) allows the direct measurement of RNA molecules in the native orientation (Garalde et al. 2018), but sequencing of complementary-DNA (cDNA) libraries yields generally a larger number of reads (Workman et al. 2018). Although strand-specific adapters can be used, error rates hinder their detection. Current methods rely on the comparison to a genome or transcriptome reference (Wyman and Mortazavi 2018; Workman et al. 2018) or on the use of additional technologies (Fu et al. 2018), which limits the applicability of rapid and cost-effective long-read sequencing for transcriptomics beyond model species. To facilitate the interrogation of transcriptomes de-novo in species or samples for which a genome or transcriptome reference is not available, we have developed ReorientExpress (https://github.com/comprna/reorientexpress), a new tool to perform reference-free orientation of ONT reads from a cDNA library, with our without stranded adapters. ReorientExpress uses a deep neural network (DNN) to predict the orientation of cDNA long-reads independently of adapters and without using a reference.",

    "abstract": "Gene duplicates provide protection against loss-of-function mutations. This protective redundancy partly relies on the fact that paralogs carry their functions independently, i.e. the inactivation of one gene copy does not impair the function of the other copy. However, a significant fraction of paralogous proteins may form functionally dependent pairs, for instance through heteromerization. As a consequence, one could expect these heteromeric paralogs to be less protective against deleterious mutations. To test this hypothesis, we examined the fitness landscape of gene loss-of-function by CRISPR-Cas9 in more than 450 human cell lines. Our analysis revealed a robustness landscape of human cells showing regions of higher vulnerability to gene inactivation as a function of key paralog properties. We find that heteromerizing paralogs are indeed less protective than non-heteromeric ones, but this association is largely due to their higher abundance and their larger number of protein-protein interaction partners.",

To test some of these theories we re-analyzed data from Bonnevie et al. (2013), in which the hippocampus was inactivated and grid cells were recorded in the MEC, to investigate whether the firing associations of grid cells depend on hippocampal inputs. Specifically, we examined temporal and spatial correlations in the firing times of simultaneously recorded grid cells before and during hippocampal inactivation. Our analysis revealed evidence of network coherence in grid cells even in the absence of hippocampal input to the MEC, both in regular grid cells and in those that became head-direction cells after hippocampal inactivation. This favors models which suggest that phase relations between grid cells in the MEC are dependent on intrinsic connectivity within the MEC.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in neutron scattering instrumentation and sample handling have enabled studies of more complex biological samples and measurements at shorter exposure times. The experiments are typically conducted in D2O-based buffers to emphasize or diminish scattering from a particular components or to minimize background noise in the experiment. To extract most information from such experiments it is thus desirable to determine accurate estimates of how and when closely bound hydrogen atoms from the biomolecule exchange with the deuterium in the solvent. We introduce and document software, PSX, for exploring the effect of hydrogen-deuterium exchange for proteins solubilized in D2O as well as the underlying bioinformatical models. The software aims to be generally applicable for any atomistic structure of a protein and its surrounding environment, and thus captures effects of both heterogenous exchange rates throughout the protein structure and by varying the experimental conditions such as pH and temperature. The paper concludes with examples of applications and estimates of the effect in typical scenarios emerging in small-angle neutron scattering on biological macromolecules in solution. Our analysis suggests that the common assumption of 90% exchange is in many cases an overestimate with the rapid sample handling systems currently available, which leads to fitting and calibration issues when analysing the data.

    "abstract": "Understanding the contribution of cognitive processes and their underlying neurophysiological signals to behavioral phenomena has been a key objective in recent neuroscience research. Using a diffusion-model framework, we investigated to what extent well-established correlates of spatial attention in the electro-encephalogram contribute to behavioral performance in an auditory free-field sound-localization task. Younger and older participants were instructed to indicate the horizontal position of a pre-defined target among three simultaneously presented distractors. The central question of interest was whether posterior alpha lateralization and amplitudes of the anterior contralateral N2 subcomponent (N2ac) predict sound localization performance (accuracy, mean reaction time) and/or diffusion model parameters (drift rate, boundary separation, non-decision time). Two age groups were compared to explore whether in older adults, who struggle with multi-speaker environments, the brain-behavior relationship would differ from younger adults. Regression analyses revealed that N2ac amplitudes predicted drift rate and accuracy, whereas alpha lateralization was not related to behavioral or diffusion modeling parameters. This was true irrespective of age. The results indicate that a more efficient attentional filtering and selection of information within an auditory scene, reflected by increased N2ac amplitudes, was associated with a higher speed of information uptake (drift rate) and better localization performance (accuracy), while the underlying response criteria (threshold separation), mean reaction times, and non-decisional processes remained unaffected. The lack of a behavioral correlate of post-stimulus alpha power lateralization constrast the well-established notion that pre-stimulus alpha power reflects a functionally relevant attentional mechanism. This highlights the importance of distinguishing anticipatory from post-stimulus alpha power modulations.",

In both cases we show that the correct model can be identified, in the majority of cases, from symptom onset data generated from multiple outbreaks in small populations. The method works by evaluating the likelihood using a particle filter that incorporates a novel importance sampling algorithm designed for partially-observed continuous-time Markov chains. This is combined with another importance sampling method to unbiasedly estimate the model evidence. These come with estimates of precision, which allow for stopping criterion to be employed.

    "abstract": "BackgroundUnderstanding the effects of environment on livestock provides valuable information on how farm animals express their production potential, and on their welfare. Ruminants often face perturbations that affect their performance. Evaluating the effect of these perturbations on animal performance could provide metrics to quantify how animals cope with their environment and therefore, better manage them. In dairy systems, milk production records can be used to evaluate perturbations because (1) they are easily accessible, (2) the overall dynamics throughout the lactation process have been widely described, and (3) perturbations often occur and cause milk loss. In this study, a lactation curve model with explicit representation of perturbations was developed.\\n\\nMethodsThe perturbed lactation model is made of two components. The first one describes a theoretical unperturbed lactation curve (unperturbed lactation model), and the second describes deviations from the unperturbed lactation model. The model was fitted on 319 complete lactation data from 181 individual dairy goats allowing for the characterization of individual perturbations in terms of their starting date, intensity, and shape.\\n\\nResultsThe fitting procedure detected a total of 2,354 perturbations with an average of 7.40 perturbations per lactation. Loss of production due to perturbations varied between 2% and 19%. Results show that the number of perturbations is not the major factor explaining the loss in milk yield over the lactation, suggesting that there are different types of animal response to challenging factors.\\n\\nConclusionsBy incorporating explicit representation of perturbations, the model allowed the characterization of potential milk production, deviations induced by perturbations (loss of milk), and thereby comparison between animals. These indicators are likely to be useful to move from raw data to decision support tools in dairy production.",

    "abstract": "The innovation of new therapies to combat multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria is being outpaced by the continued rise of MDR bacterial infections. Of particular concern are hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) recalcitrant to antibiotic therapies. The Gram-positive intestinal pathobiont Enterococcus faecalis is associated with HAIs and some strains are MDR. Therefore, novel strategies to control E. faecalis populations are needed. We previously characterized an E. faecalis Type II CRISPR-Cas system and demonstrated its utility in the sequence-specific removal of antibiotic resistance determinants. Here we present work describing the adaption of this CRISPR-Cas system into a constitutively expressed module encoded on a pheromone-responsive conjugative plasmid that efficiently transfers to E. faecalis for the selective removal of antibiotic resistance genes. Using in vitro competition assays, we show that these CRISPR-Cas-encoding delivery plasmids, or CRISPR-Cas antimicrobials, can reduce the occurrence of antibiotic resistance in enterococcal populations in a sequence-specific manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate that deployment of CRISPR-Cas antimicrobials in the murine intestine reduces the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant E. faecalis by several orders of magnitude. Finally, we show that E. faecalis donor strains harboring CRISPR-Cas antimicrobials are immune to uptake of antibiotic resistance determinants in vivo. Our results demonstrate that conjugative delivery of CRISPR-Cas antimicrobials may be adaptable for future deployment from probiotic bacteria for exact targeting of defined MDR bacteria or for precision engineering of polymicrobial communities in the mammalian intestine.\\n\\nImportanceCRISPR-Cas nucleic acid targeting systems hold promise for the amelioration of multidrug-resistant enterococci, yet the utility of such tools in the context of the intestinal environment where enterococci reside is understudied. We describe the development of a CRISPR-Cas antimicrobial, deployed on a conjugative plasmid, for the targeted removal of antibiotic resistance genes from intestinal Enterococcus faecalis. We demonstrate that CRISPR-Cas targeting reduces antibiotic resistance of E. faecalis by several orders of magnitude in the intestine. Although barriers exist that influence the penetrance of the conjugative CRISPR-Cas antimicrobial among target recipient E. faecalis cells, the removal of antibiotic resistance genes in E. faecalis upon uptake of the CRISPR-Cas antimicrobial is absolute. In addition, cells that obtain the CRISPR-Cas antimicrobial are immunized against the acquisition of new antibiotic resistance genes. This study suggests a potential path toward plasmid based CRISPR-Cas therapies in the intestine.",

Accordingly, significant efforts have been devoted to engineer novel tools that i) achieve high-level stable gene transfer at low toxicity to the host cell; ii) induce low levels of genotoxicity and possess a  safe integration profile with a high proportion of integrations into safe genomic locations; and iii) are associated with acceptable cost per treatment and scalable/exportable vector production to serve large numbers of patients. The Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon has been transformed into a vector system that is fulfilling these requirements.\\n\\nIn the CARAMBA project, we use SB transposition to genetically modify T cells with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) specific for the SLAMF7 antigen, that is uniformly and highly expressed on malignant plasma cells in multiple myeloma. We have demonstrated that SLAMF7 CAR-T cells confer specific and very potent anti-myeloma reactivity in pre-clinical models, and are therefore preparing a Phase I/IIa clinical trial of adoptive immunotherapy with autologous, patient-derived SLAMF7-CAR T cells in multiple myeloma (EudraCT Nr. 2019-001264-30/CARAMBA-1).\\n\\nHere we report on the characterization of genomic safety attributes in SLAMF7 CAR-T cells that we prepared in three clinical-grade manufacturing campaigns under good manufacturing practice (GMP), using T cells that we obtained from three healthy donor volunteers. In the SLAMF7 CAR-T cell product, we determined the average transposon copy number, the genomic insertion profile, and presence of residual SB100X transposase. The data show that the SLAMF7 CAR transposon had been inserted into the T cell genome with the close-to-random distribution pattern that is typical for SB, and with an average transposon copy number ranging between 6 and 12 per T cell. No residual SB100X transposase could be detected by Western blotting in the infusion products. With these attributes, the SLAMF7 CAR-T products satisfy criteria set forth by competent regulatory authorities in order to justify administration of SLAMF7 CAR-T cells to humans in the context of a clinical trial.

    "abstract": "Integrating association results from both genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping studies has the potential to shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying disease etiology. Several statistical methods have been recently developed to integrate GWASs with eQTL studies in the form of transcriptome-wide association studies (TWASs). These existing methods can all be viewed as a form of two sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, which has been widely applied in various GWASs for inferring the causal relationship among complex traits. Unfortunately, most existing TWAS and MR methods make an unrealistic modeling assumption and assume that instrumental variables do not exhibit horizontal pleiotropic effects. However, horizontal pleiotropic effects have been recently discovered to be wide spread across complex traits, and, as we will show here, are also wide spread across gene expression traits. Therefore, not allowing for horizontal pleiotropic effects can be overly restrictive, and, as we will be show here, can lead to a substantial inflation of test statistics and subsequently false discoveries in TWAS applications. Here, we present a probabilistic MR method, which we refer to as PMR-Egger, for testing and controlling for horizontal pleiotropic effects in TWAS applications. PMR-Egger relies on an MR likelihood framework that unifies many existing TWAS and MR methods, accommodates multiple correlated instruments, tests the causal effect of gene on trait in the presence of horizontal pleiotropy, and, with a newly developed parameter expansion version of the expectation maximization algorithm, is scalable to hundreds of thousands of individuals. With extensive simulations, we show that PMR-Egger provides calibrated type I error control for causal effect testing in the presence of horizontal pleiotropic effects, is reasonably robust for various types of horizontal pleiotropic effect mis-specifications, is more powerful than existing MR approaches, and, as a by-product, can directly test for horizontal pleiotropy. We illustrate the benefits of PMR-Egger in applications to 39 diseases and complex traits obtained from three GWASs including the UK Biobank. In these applications, we show how PMR-Egger can lead to new biological discoveries through integrative analysis.",

    "abstract": "The importance of social hierarchies has led to the development of many techniques for inferring social ranks, leaving researchers with an overwhelming array of options to choose from. Many of our research questions involve longitudinal analyses, so we were interested in a method that would provide reliable ranks across time. But how does one determine which method performs best?\\n\\nWe attempt to answer this question by using a training-testing procedure to compare 13 different approaches for calculating dominance hierarchies (seven methods, plus 6 analytical variants of these). We assess each methods performance, its efficiency, and the extent to which the calculated ranks obtained from the training dataset accurately predict the outcome of observed aggression in the testing dataset.\\n\\nWe found that all methods tested performed well, despite some differences in inferred rank order. With respect to the need for a \\\"burn-in\\\" period to enable reliable ranks to be calculated, again, all methods were efficient and able to infer reliable ranks from the very start of the study period (i.e., with little to no burn-in period). Using a common 6-month burn-in period to aid comparison, we found that all methods could predict aggressive outcomes accurately for the subsequent 10 months.

The actively retrotransposing L1s are mostly limited to the L1 human specific Ta subfamily. In this manuscript, we present REBELseq as a method for the construction of differentially amplified next-generation sequencing libraries and bioinformatic identification of Ta subfamily long interspersed element-1 human specific elements. REBELseq was performed on DNA isolated from NeuN+ neuronal nuclei from postmortem brain samples of 177 individuals and empirically-driven bioinformatic and experimental cutoffs were established. REBELseq reliably identified both known and novel Ta subfamily L1 insertions distributed throughout the genome. Differences in the proportion of individuals possessing a given reference or non-reference retrotransposon insertion were identified. We conclude that REBELseq is an unbiased, whole genome approach to the amplification and detection of Ta subfamily L1 retrotransposons.",

    "abstract": "Whole-exome sequencing (WES) enrichment platforms are usually evaluated by measuring the depth of coverage at target regions. However, variants called in WES are reported in the variant call format (VCF) file, which is filtered by minimum site coverage and mapping quality. Therefore, genotypability (base calling calculated by combining depth of coverage with the confidence of read alignment) should be considered as a more informative parameter to assess the performance of WES. We found that the mapping quality of reads aligned to difficult target regions was improved by increasing the DNA fragment length well above the average exon size. We tested three different DNA fragment lengths using four major commercial WES platforms and found that longer DNA fragments achieved a higher percentage of callable bases in the target regions and thus improved the genotypability of many genes, including several associated with clinical phenotypes. DNA fragment size also affected the uniformity of coverage, which in turn influences genotypability, indicating that different platforms are optimized for different DNA fragment lengths. Finally, we found that although the depth of coverage continued to increase in line with the sequencing depth (overall number of reads), base calling reached saturation at a depth of coverage that depended on the enrichment platform and DNA fragment length. This confirmed that genotypability provides better estimates for the optimal sequencing depth of each fragment size/enrichment platform combination.",

    "abstract": "Brucella are intracellular pathogens that cause a disease known as brucellosis. Though the genus is highly monomorphic at the genetic level, species have animal host preferences and some defining physiologic characteristics. Of note is the requirement for increased CO2 tension to cultivate particular species, which confounded early efforts to isolate B. abortus from diseased cattle. Differences in the capacity of Brucella species to assimilate CO2 are determined by mutations in the carbonic anhydrase gene, bcaA. Ancestral single nucleotide insertions in bcaA have resulted in frameshifted pseudogenes in B. abortus and B. ovis lineages, which underlie their inability to grow under the low CO2 tension of a standard atmosphere. Incubation of wild-type B. ovis in air selects for mutations that \\\"rescue\\\" a functional bcaA reading frame, which enables growth under low CO2 and enhances growth rate in high CO2. Consistent with this result, we show that heterologous expression of functional E. coli carbonic anhydrases enables B. ovis growth in air. Growth of wild-type B. ovis is acutely sensitive to a reduction in CO2 tension, while frame-rescued B. ovis mutants are completely insensitive to CO2 shifts. Wild-type B. ovis initiates a gene expression program upon CO2 downshift that resembles the stringent response and results in activation of its virB type IV secretion system. Our study provides evidence that loss-of-function insertion mutations in bcaA sensitize the response of B. ovis and B. abortus to reduced CO2 tension relative to other Brucella lineages. CO2-dependent starvation and virulence gene expression programs in these species may influence persistence or transmission in natural hosts.\\n\\nImportanceBrucella spp. are highly related, but exhibit differences in animal host preference that must be determined by genome sequence differences. B. ovis and the majority of B. abortus strains require increased CO2 tension to be cultivated in vitro, and harbor conserved insertional mutations in the carbonic anhydrase, bcaA, which underlie this trait. Mutants that grow in a standard atmosphere, first reported nearly a century ago, are easily selected in the laboratory. These mutants harbor varied indel polymorphisms in bcaA that restore its consensus reading frame and rescue its function. Loss of bcaA function has evolved independently in the B. ovis and B. abortus lineages, and results in a dramatically increased sensitivity to CO2 limitation.",

    "abstract": "The application of statistical methods to comparatively framed questions about protein dynamics can potentially enable investigations of biomolecular function beyond the current sequence and structural methods in bioinformatics. However, chaotic behavior in single protein trajectories requires statistical inference be obtained from large ensembles of molecular dynamic (MD) simulations representing the comparative functional states of a given protein. Meaningful interpretation of such a complex form of big data poses serious challenges to users of MD. Here, we announce DROIDS v3.0, a molecular dynamic (MD) method + software package for comparative protein dynamics, incorporating many new features including maxDemon v1.0, a multi-method machine learning application that trains on large ensemble comparisons of concerted protein motions in opposing functional states and deploys learned classifications of these states onto newly generated protein dynamic simulations. Local canonical correlations in learning patterns generated from self-similar MD runs are used to identify regions of functionally conserved protein dynamics. Subsequent impacts of genetic and drug class variants on conserved dynamics can also be analyzed by deploying the classifiers on variant MD runs and quantifying how often these altered protein systems display the opposing functional states. Here, we present several case studies of complex changes in functional protein dynamics caused by temperature, genetic mutation, and binding interaction with nucleic acids and small molecules. We studied the impact of genetic variation on functionally conserved protein dynamics in ubiquitin and TATA binding protein and demonstrate that our learning algorithm can properly identify regions of conserved dynamics. We also report impacts to dynamics that correspond well with predicted disruptive effects of a variety of genetic mutations. In addition, we studied the impact of drug class variation on the ATP binding region of Hsp90, similarly identifying conserved dynamics and impacts that rank accordingly with how closely various Hsp90 inhibitors mimic natural ATP binding.\\n\\nStatement of significanceWe propose a statistical method as well as offer a user-friendly graphical interfaced software pipeline for comparing simulations of the complex motions (i.e. dynamics) of proteins in different functional states. We also provide both method and software to apply artificial intelligence (i.e. machine learning methods) that enable the computer to recognize complex functional differences in protein dynamics on new simulations and report them to the user. This method can identify dynamics important for protein function, as well as to quantify how the motions of molecular variants differ from these important functional dynamic states. For the first time, this method of analysis allows the impacts of different genetic backgrounds or drug classes to be examined within the context of functional motions of the specific protein system under investigation.",

ILC3 and neuronal cells were shown to interact at discrete mucosal locations to steer mucosal defence2,3. Nevertheless, whether neuroimmune circuits operate at an organismal level, integrating extrinsic environmental signals to orchestrate ILC3 responses remains elusive. Here we show that light-entrained and brain-tuned circadian circuits regulate enteric ILC3, intestinal homeostasis, gut defence and the host lipid metabolism. We found that enteric ILC3 display circadian expression of clock genes and ILC3-related transcription factors. ILC3-autonomous ablation of the circadian regulator Arntl led to disrupted gut ILC3 homeostasis, impaired epithelial reactivity, deregulated microbiome, increased susceptibility to bowel infection and disrupted lipid metabolism. Loss of ILC3-intrinsic Arntl shaped the gut postcode receptors of ILC3. Strikingly, light-dark cycles, feeding rhythms and microbial cues differentially regulated ILC3 clocks, with light signals as major entraining cues of ILC3. Accordingly, surgical- and genetically-induced deregulation of brain rhythmicity led to disrupted circadian ILC3 oscillations, deregulated microbiome and altered lipid metabolism. Our work reveals a circadian circuitry that translates environmental light cues into enteric ILC3, shaping intestinal health, metabolism and organismal homeostasis.",

We unveil the evolutionary structure of tree species diversity across the Americas to assess whether an inability to move (dispersal limitation) or to evolve (niche conservatism) is the predominant constraint in plant diversification and biogeography. We find a fundamental divide in tree lineage composition between tropical and extratropical environments, defined by the absence versus presence of freezing temperatures. Within the Neotropics, we uncover a further evolutionary split between moist and dry forests. Our results demonstrate that American tree lineages, though broadly distributed geographically, tend to retain their ancestral environmental relationships and that phylogenetic niche conservatism is the primary force structuring the distribution of tree biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "Constructing antibody repertoires is an important error-correcting step in analyzing immunosequencing datasets that is important for reconstructing evolutionary (clonal) development of antibodies. However, the state-of-the-art repertoire construction tools typically miss low-abundance antibodies that often represent internal nodes in clonal trees and are crucially important for clonal tree reconstruction. Thus, although repertoire construction is a prerequisite for follow up clonal tree reconstruction, the existing repertoire reconstruction algorithms are not well suited for this task. Since clonal analysis has the potential to reveal errors in the constructed repertoires and contribute to constructing more accurate repertoires, we advocate a tree-guided construction of antibody repertoires that combines error correction and clonal reconstruction as interconnected (rather than independent) tasks. We developed the IgEvolution algorithm for simultaneous repertoire and clonal tree reconstruction and applied it for analyzing multiple immunosequencing datasets representing antigen-specific immune responses. We demonstrate that analysis of clonal trees reveals highly mutable positions that correlate with antigen-binding sites and light-chain contacts in crystallized antibody-antigen complexes. We further demonstrate that this analysis leads to a new approach for identifying complementarity determining regions (CDRs) in antibodies.",

The aim of this study was to elucidate tissue-specific contributions and molecular mechanisms underlying cancer-induced metabolic perturbations.\n\nMethodsGlucose uptake in skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue (WAT), as well as hepatic glucose production, were determined in control and Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice using isotopic tracers. Skeletal muscle microvascular perfusion was analyzed via a real-time contrast-enhanced ultrasound technique. Finally, the role of fatty acid turnover on glycemic control was determined by treating tumor-bearing insulin-resistant mice with nicotinic acid or etomoxir.\n\nResultsLLC tumor-bearing mice displayed reduced insulin-induced blood-glucose-lowering and glucose intolerance, which was restored by etomoxir or nicotinic acid. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was 30-40% reduced in skeletal muscle and WAT of mice carrying large tumors. Despite compromised glucose uptake, tumor-bearing mice displayed upregulated insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of TBC1D4Thr642 (+18%), AKTSer474 (+65%), and AKTThr309 (+86%) in muscle. Insulin caused a 70% increase in muscle microvascular perfusion in control mice, which was abolished in tumor-bearing mice. Additionally, tumor-bearing mice displayed increased (+45%) basal (not insulin-stimulated) hepatic glucose production.\n\nConclusionsCancer can result in marked perturbations on at least six metabolically essential functions; i) insulins blood-glucose-lowering effect, ii) glucose tolerance, iii) skeletal muscle and WAT insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, iv) intramyocellular insulin signaling, v) muscle microvascular perfusion, and vi) basal hepatic glucose production in mice.

    "abstract": "Our earlier study demonstrated that head-to-head CMGs that encircle duplex DNA and track inward at origins, melt double-strand (ds) DNA while encircling the duplex by pulling on opposite strands and shearing DNA apart (Langston and ODonnell (2019) eLife 9, e46515). We show here that increasing the methylphosphonate neutral DNA from 10 nucleotides in the previous report, to 20 nucleotides, reveals that CMG encircling duplex DNA only interacts with the tracking strand compared to the non-tracking strand. This significantly enhances support that CMG tracks on duplex DNA by binding only one strand. Furthermore, EMSA assays using AMPPNP to load CMG onto DNA shows a stoichiometry of only 2 CMGs on an origin mimic DNA, containing a 150 bp duplex with two 3 prime single-strand (ss) tails, one on each end, enabling assay of dsDNA unwinding by a shearing force produced by only two head-to-head CMGs. The use of non-hydrolysable AMPPNP enabled a preincubation for CMG binding the two 3 prime tailed origin mimic DNA, and gave robust unwinding of dsDNA by head-to-head CMG-Mcm10s. With this precedent, it is possible to envision that the cell may utilize opposing dsDNA motors to unwind DNA for other types of DNA transactions besides origin unwinding.",

    "abstract": "Recording from single neurons in the brain for long periods of time has been a central goal in both basic neuroscience and translational neurology, in order to understand mechanisms underlying brain processes such as learning and to understand the pathogenesis of neurodynamic disease states 1. Recent advances in materials engineering, digital signal acquisition, and analysis algorithms have brought us closer to achieving this goal, and the possibility has gathered much public attention 2,3. However, it remains a challenge to record from the same units for weeks to months. Here, we record many high-quality tetrode neuronal signals reliably over long periods of time in both deep and superficial areas of the brain. We achieve this by combining electrochemical roughening and carbon nanotube coating of a flexible platinum/iridium substrate, with materials, packaging, and insertion optimized to minimize tip movement with brain pulsation. This \\\"Magdeburger\\\" probe enables recordings with long-term signal stability and high signal-to-noise ratio at a reasonable cost in both rodent brains and in substantially larger primate brains. Robust tetrode tracking of identified neurons over longer time periods, in multiple independently targeted areas of the brain, will allow fundamental advances in the study of cognitive learning, aging, and pathogenesis, and opens new possibilities for brain interfaces in humans.",

    "abstract": "Various processes occur in memory retrieval in recognition memory and it is necessary to investigate memory brain function. Most of the research in past decades have focused on particular brain region function, but the interaction between these has a major role in human cognition. In this study, we used the memory retrieval task to investigate the underlying mechanism of recognition memory. The connectivity between brain regions is estimated from scalp electroencephalography signals that were recorded from twenty-three healthy subject participated in recognition memory task to correctly classify old/new words. Multivariate autoregressive models (MVAR) are used for the determination of Granger causality to estimate the effective connectivity in the time-frequency domain. We use GPDC and dDTF methods because they have almost resolved the previous problems in estimations. Results show that brain regions in the old condition have greater global connectivity in the theta and gamma band compared to the new words retrieval. Connectivity within and between the brains hemisphere may be related to correct rejection. The left frontal has a crucial role in recollection. theta and gamma specific connectivity pattern between temporal, parietal and frontal cortex may disclose the retrieval mechanism. old/new comparison resulted in the different patterns of network connection. These results and other evidence emphasize the role of frequency of causal network interactions in the memory process.",

    "abstract": "Skin cancer is a crucial public health issue and by far the most usual kind of cancer specifically in the region of North America. It is estimated that in 2019, only because of melanoma nearly 7,230 people will die, and 192,310 cases of malignant melanoma will be diagnosed. Nonetheless, nearly all types of skin lesions can be treatable if they can be diagnosed at an earlier stage. The accurate prediction of skin lesions is a critically challenging task even for vastly experienced clinicians and dermatologist due to a little distinction between surrounding skin and lesions, visual resemblance between melanoma and other skin lesions, fuddled lesion border, etc. A well-grounded automated computer-aided skin lesions detection system can help clinicians immensely to prognosis malignant skin lesion in the earliest possible time. From the past few years, the emergence of machine learning and deep learning in the medical imaging has produced several image-based classification systems in the medical field and these systems perform better than traditional image processing classification methods. In this paper, we proposed a popular deep learning technique namely atrous or, dilated convolution for skin lesions classification, which is known to have enhanced accuracy with the same amount of computational cost compared to traditional CNN. To implement atrous convolution we choose the transfer learning technique with several popular deep learning architectures such as VGG16, VGG19, MobileNet, and InceptionV3. To train, validate, and test our proposed models we utilize HAM10000 dataset which contains total 10015 dermoscopic images of seven different skin lesions (melanoma, melanocytic nevi, Basal cell carcinoma, Benign keratosis-like lesions, Dermatofibroma, Vascular lesions, and Actinic keratoses). Four of our proposed dilated convolutional frameworks show promising outcome on overall accuracy and per-class accuracy. For example, overall test accuracy achieved 87.42%, 85.02%, 88.22%, and 89.81% on dilated VGG16, dilated VGG19, dilated MobileNet, and dilated IncaptionV3 respectively. These dilated convolutional models outperformed existing networks in both overall accuracy and individual class accuracy. Among all the architectures dilated InceptionV3 shows superior classification accuracy and dilated MobileNet is also achieving almost impressive classification accuracy like dilated InceptionV3 with the lightest computational complexities than all other proposed model. Compared to previous works done on skin lesions classification we have experimented one of the most complicated open-source datasets with class imbalances and achieved better accuracy (dilated inceptionv3) than any known methods to the best of our knowledge.",

    "abstract": "The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident glycoprotein UL148 is posited to play roles in immune evasion and regulation of viral cell tropism. UL148 prevents cell surface presentation of the immune cell costimulatory ligand CD58 while promoting maturation and virion incorporation of glycoprotein O, a receptor binding subunit for an envelope glycoprotein complex involved in entry. Meanwhile, UL148 activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) and causes large-scale reorganization of the ER. In an effort to determine whether the seemingly disparate effects of UL148 are related or discrete, we generated charged-cluster-to-alanine (CCTA) mutants of six charged clusters within the UL148 ectodomain, and compared them against wildtype UL148, in the context of recombinant viruses and in ectopic expression, assaying for effects on ER remodeling and CD58 surface presentation. Two mutants, targeting charged clusters spanning residues 79-83 (CC3) and 133-136 (CC4), respectively, retained the potential to impede CD58 presentation, and did so to an extent comparable to wildtype. Of the six mutants, only CC3 retained the capacity to reorganize the ER, showing a partial phenotype. Wildtype UL148 accumulates in a detergent-insoluble form during infection. However, all six CCTA mutants were fully soluble, which may imply a relationship between insolubility and organelle remodeling. Additionally, we found that the chimpanzee cytomegalovirus UL148 homolog suppresses CD58 presentation but fails to reorganize the ER, while the homolog from rhesus cytomegalovirus shows neither activity. Collectively, our findings illustrate varying degrees of functional divergence between homologous primate cytomegalovirus immunevasins and suggest that ER reorganization is unique to HCMV UL148.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEIn myriad examples, viral gene products cause striking effects on cells, such as activation of stress responses. It can be challenging to decipher how such effects contribute to the biological roles of the proteins. The HCMV glycoprotein UL148 retains CD58 within the ER, thereby preventing it from reaching the cell surface where it functions to stimulate cell-mediated antiviral responses. Intriguingly, UL148 also triggers the formation of large, ER-derived membranous structures, and activates the UPR, a set of signaling pathways involved in adaptation to ER stress. We demonstrate that the potential of UL148 to reorganize the ER and to retain CD58 are separable by mutagenesis and possibly, by evolution, since chimpanzee cytomegalovirus UL148 retains CD58 but does not remodel the ER. Our findings imply that ER reorganization contributes to other roles of UL148, such as modulation of alternative viral glycoprotein complexes that govern the virus ability to infect different cell types.",

    "abstract": "During morphogenesis, epithelial tubes elongate. In case of the mammalian lung, biased elongation has been linked to a bias in cell shape and cell division, but it has remained unclear whether a bias in cell shape along the axis of outgrowth is sufficient for biased outgrowth and how it arises. Here, we use our 2D cell-based tissue simulation software LBIBCell to investigate the conditions for biased epithelial outgrowth. We show that the observed bias in cell shape and cell division can result in the observed bias in outgrowth only in case of strong cortical tension, and comparison to biological data suggests that the cortical tension in epithelia is likely sufficient. We explore mechanisms that may result in the observed bias in cell division and cell shapes. To this end, we test the possibility that the surrounding tissue or extracellular matrix acts as a mechanical constraint that biases growth in longitudinal direction. While external compressive forces can result in the observed bias in outgrowth, we find that they do not result in the observed bias in cell shapes. We conclude that other mechanisms must exist that generate the bias in lung epithelial outgrowth.",

    "abstract": "Activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway by mutations within its components drives the growth of several cancers. However, the role of Hh pathway activation in lung cancers has been controversial. We demonstrate that the Hh signaling pathway is activated in lung stroma in a paracrine manner. Genetic deletion of Shh in autochthonous murine lung adenocarcinoma had no effect on survival. Early abrogation of the pathway by an anti-SHH/IHH antibody 5E1 led to significantly worse survival with increased tumor and metastatic burden. Loss of IHH by in vivo CRISPR led to more aggressive tumor growth suggesting that IHH, not SHH, activates the pathway in stroma to drive its tumor suppressive effects - a novel role for IHH in the lung. Tumors from mice treated with 5E1 had decreased blood vessel density and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS). Treatment of KP mice with 5E1 and N-acetylcysteine, as a ROS scavenger, decreased tumor ROS levels, inhibited tumor growth and prolonged mouse survival suggesting that increased ROS levels from stromal Hh pathway inhibition spurred lung tumor growth. Thus, IHH induces stromal Hh pathway activation to suppress tumor growth and metastases, in part, by limiting ROS production.",

Here, we show that human METTL2 forms a complex with DALR anticodon binding domain containing 3 (DALRD3) protein in order to recognize particular arginine tRNAs destined for m3C modification. Using biochemical reconstitution, we find that METTL2-DALDR3 complexes catalyze m3C formation in vitro that is dependent upon sequence elements specific to certain arginine tRNAs. Notably, DALRD3-deficient human cells exhibit nearly complete loss of the m3C modification in arginine tRNAs.

However, the assessment of intrinsic plasticity in DG has been surprisingly limited. We employed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to explore the impact of behaviorally relevant theta-modulated burst firing, in the absence of synaptic stimulation, on intrinsic properties of rat DG granule cells. We found that theta burst firing induced a significant reduction in sub-threshold excitability and temporal summation, accompanied by an unexpectedly contrasting enhancement of action potential firing rate. We show that conjunctive changes in HCN, inward-rectifier potassium and persistent sodium channels mediated this form of plasticity, which was dependent on calcium influx through L-type calcium channels and inositol trisphosphate receptors. Our results unveil the expression of conjunctive plasticity in multiple channels, responding to the same activity pattern, establishing a plasticity manifold that could concomitantly mediate encoding and homeostasis in DG engram cells.",

    "abstract": "The therapeutic benefits of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) in Parkinson disease (PD) patients diminishes with the onset of abnormal involuntary movements (L-DOPA induced dyskinesia), a debilitating motor side effect. L-DOPA induced dyskinesia are due to altered dopaminergic signaling in the striatum, a brain region that controls motor and cognitive functions. However, the molecular mechanisms that promote L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia remain unclear. Here, we have reported that RasGRP1 (also known as CalDAG-GEF-II) physiologically mediated L-DOPA induced dyskinesia in a 6-hydroxy dopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned mouse model of PD. In this study, L-DOPA treatment rapidly upregulated RasGRP1 in the striatum. Our findings showed that RasGRP1 deleted mice (RasGRP1-/-) had drastically diminished L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia, and RasGRP1-/- mice did not interfere with the therapeutic benefits of L-DOPA. In terms of its mechanism, RasGRP1 mediates L-DOPA-induced extracellular regulated kinase (ERK), the mammalian target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR) and the cAMP/PKA pathway and binds directly with Ras-homolog-enriched in the brain (Rheb), which is a potent activator of mTOR, both in vitro and in the intact striatum. High-resolution tandem mass tag mass spectrometry analysis of striatal tissue revealed significant targets, such as phosphodiesterase (Pde1c), Pde2a, catechol-o-methyltransferase (comt), and glutamate decarboxylase 1 and 2 (Gad1 and Gad2), which are downstream regulators of RasGRP1 and are linked to L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia vulnerability. Collectively, the findings of this study demonstrated that RasGRP1 is a major regulator of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in the striatum. Drugs or gene-depletion strategies targeting RasGRP1 may offer novel therapeutic opportunities for preventing L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in PD patients.",

Here, we demonstrate that vertebrate ZKSCAN3 and Drosophila M1BP are functionally homologous transcription factors in autophagy repression. Expression of ZKSCAN3 in Drosophila prevents premature autophagy onset due to loss of M1BP function and conversely, M1BP expression in human cells can prevent starvation-induced autophagy due to loss of nuclear ZKSCAN3 function. In Drosophila ZKSCAN3 binds genome-wide to sequences targeted by M1BP and transcriptionally regulates the majority of M1BP-controlled genes. These data allow the potential for transitioning the mechanisms, gene targets and plethora metabolic processes controlled by M1BP onto ZKSCAN3 and opens up Drosophila as a tool in studying the function of ZKSCAN3 in autophagy and tumourigenesis.",

Specifically, this has restricted studies of intracellular dynamics to one strain at a time and thus, generally, to the impact of genes with known function. Here we show how in situ genotyping of a library of E. coli strains after time-lapse imaging in a microfluidic device overcomes this problem. We determine how 235 different CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) knockdowns impact the coordination of the replication and division cycles of E. coli by monitoring the location of replication forks throughout on average >500 cell cycles per knockdown. The single-cell time-resolved assay allows us to determine the distribution of single-cell growth rates, cell division sizes, and replication initiation volumes. Subsequent in situ genotyping allows us to map each phenotype distribution to a specific genetic perturbation in order to determine which genes are important for cell cycle control. The technology presented in this study enables genome-scale screens of virtually all live-cell microscopy assays and, therefore, constitutes a qualitatively new approach to cellular biophysics.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short non-coding RNAs that function in RNA silencing and post-transcriptional gene regulation. Besides their participation in regulating normal physiological activities, specific miRNA types could act as oncogenes, tumor suppressors or metastasis regulators, which are critical biomarkers for cancer. However, direct characterization of miRNA is challenging due to its unique properties such as its low abundance, sequence similarities and short length. Nanopore Induced Phase Shift Sequencing (NIPSS), which is a variant form of nanopore sequencing, could directly sequence any short analytes including miRNA. In practice, NIPSS clearly discriminates between different identities, isoforms and epigenetic variants of model miRNA sequences. This work demonstrates the first report of direct miRNA sequencing, which serves as a complement to existing miRNA sensing routines by the introduction of single molecule resolution. Future engineering of this technique may assist miRNA based early stage diagnosis or inspire novel cancer therapeutics.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=95 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/747113v1_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (33K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@216b4borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b1e88org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b04aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dcdbb7_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Death receptor signaling is critical for cell death, inflammation, and immune homeostasis. Hijacking death receptors and their corresponding adaptors through type III secretion system (T3SS) effectors has been evolved to be a bacterial evasion strategy. NleB from enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and SseK1/2/3 from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) can modify some death domains involved in death receptor signaling through arginine-GlcNAcylation. This study applied a limited substrate screen from 12 death domain proteins with conserved arginines during EPEC and Salmonella infection and found that NleB from EPEC hijacked death receptor signaling tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1)-associated death domain protein (TRADD), FAS-associated death domain protein (FADD), and receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), whereas SseK1 and SseK3 disturbed TNFR signaling through the modification of TRADD Arg235/245 and TNFR1 Arg376, respectively. SseK1 and SseK3 delivered by Salmonella inhibited TNF-- but not TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced cell death, which was consistent with their host substrate recognition specificity. Taking advantage of the substrate specificity of SseK effectors, we found that only SseK1 fully rescued the bacteria colonization deficiency contributed by NleBc in Citrobacter rodentium infection animal model, indicating that TRADD was likely to be the preferred in vivo substrate corresponding to NleB/SseK1-induced bacterial virulence. Furthermore, novel auto-arginine-GlcNAcylation was observed in NleB and SseK1/3, which promoted the enzyme activity. These findings suggest that arginine-GlcNAcylation in death domains and auto-arginine-GlcNAcylation catalyzed by type III-translocated bacterial effector proteins NleB/SseKs are crucial for bacteria pathogenesis in regulating nuclear factor-{kappa}B (NF-{kappa}B) and death receptor signaling pathways. This study provides an insight into the mechanism by which EPEC and Salmonella manipulate death receptor signaling and evade host immune defense through T3SS effectors.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryEnteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) are important food-borne pathogens infecting the intestine. They deliver type III secretion system effector NleB/SseKs to modify host death domain proteins by arginine GlcNAcylation. We screened the modification of 12 death domains containing conserved arginine in human genome by NleB, SseK1, SseK2, and SseK3 through ectopic co-expression and bacterial infection. Unlike multiple death receptor signaling inhibition by NleB, we found that SseK1 and SseK3 specifically hijacked tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1)-mediated death signaling through targeting TNFR1-associated death domain protein (TRADD) and receptor TNFR1, respectively. We identified the modification sites and suggested that TRADD was the in vivo target of NleB in mice infection model by utilizing the substrate specificity of SseK1 and SseK3, which highlighted anti-bacterial infection role of TRADD in death receptor signaling and non-death receptor signaling. In addition to the modification on host death domain substrates, we firstly elucidated the effect of auto-modification of the arginine GlcNAc transferases on the enzymatic activity, which widened our understanding of the newly discovered post translational modification in the process of pathogen-host interaction.",

    "abstract": "Obligate intracellular bacteria like Chlamydia trachomatis undergo a complex developmental cycle between infectious non-replicative (EBs) and non-infectious replicative (RBs) forms. EBs shortly after entering a host cell transform to RBs, a crucial process in infection, initiating chlamydial replication. As Chlamydia fail to replicate outside the host cell it is currently unknown how the transition from EBs to RBs is initiated. Here we show in a cell-free approach in axenic media that uptake of glutamine by the bacteria is critical to initiate EB-RB transition. These bacteria utilize glutamine to synthesize cell wall peptidoglycan which has recently been detected in the septa of replicating intracellular Chlamydia. The increased requirement for glutamine in infected cells is achieved by reprogramming the glutamine metabolism in a c-Myc-dependent manner. Glutamine was effectively taken up by the glutamine transporter SLC1A5 and metabolized via glutaminase. Interference with this metabolic reprogramming limited growth of Chlamydia. Intriguingly, Chlamydia failed to produce progeny in SLC1A5 knockout mice. Thus, we report on the central role of glutamine for the development of an obligate intracellular pathogenic bacterium and the reprogramming of host glutamine metabolism, which may provide a basis for innovative anti-infective strategies.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria swim in viscous liquid environments by using the flagellum1-3. The flagellum is composed of about 30 different proteins and can be roughly divided into three parts: the basal body, the hook and the filament. The basal body acts as a rotary motor powered by ion motive force across the cytoplasmic membrane as well as a protein export apparatus to construct the axial structure of the flagellum. The filament is as a helical propeller, and it is a supercoiled form of a helical tubular assembly consisting of a few tens of thousands of flagellin molecules4. The hook is a relatively short axial segment working as a universal joint connecting the basal body and the filament for smooth transmission of motor torque to the filament5,6. The structure of hook has been studied by combining X-ray crystal structure of a core fragment of hook protein FlgE and electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) helical image analysis of the polyhook in the straight form and has given a deep insight into the universal joint mechanism7. However, the supercoiled structure of the hook was an approximate model based on the atomic model of the straight hook without its inner core domain7 and EM observations of supercoiled polyhook by freeze-dry and Pt/Pd shadow cast8. Here we report the native supercoiled hook structure at 3.1 [A] resolution by cryoEM single particle image analysis of the polyhook. The atomic model built on the three-dimensional (3D) density map show the actual changes in subunit conformation and intersubunit interactions upon compression and extension of the 11 protofilaments that occur during their smoke ring-like rotation and allow the hook to function as a dynamic molecular universal joint with high bending flexibility and twisting rigidity.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we use Support Vector Machine algorithm to detect simple and complex interfaces in atomistic and coarse-grained molecular simulation trajectories of phase separating lipid bilayer systems. We show that the power spectral density of the interfacial height fluctuations and in turn the line tension of the lipid bilayer systems depend on the order parameter used to identify the intrinsic interface. To highlight the effect of artificial smoothing of the interface on the fluctuation spectra and the ensuing line tension calculations, we perform a convolution of the boundaries identified at molecular resolution with a 2D Gaussian function of variance{varepsilon} 2 equal to the resolution limit, (1/2{pi}{varepsilon}2)exp(-|r|2/2{varepsilon}2). The convolution function is given by h{otimes}g, where h is the instantaneous height fluctuation and g is the Gaussian function. This is similar to the effect of point spread functions in experiments. We find that the region of fluctuation spectra that scales according to capillary wave theory formalism depends on the complexity of the interfacial geometry, which may not always be detected at experimental resolutions. We propose that the different q-regimes in the fluctuation spectra can be used to characterize mode dependent inter-facial tensions to understand the interfaces beyond the linear line tension calculations. This could also be useful in interpretation of fluctuating boundaries in out-of-equilibrium in-vivo membrane systems that carry information about the nature of non-thermal (active) fluctuations in these systems.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria contain the genetic information and expression machinery to produce proteins essential for cellular respiration. Within the mitochondrial matrix, newly synthesized RNA, RNA processing proteins, and mitoribosome assembly factors are known to form punctate subcompartments referred to as mitochondrial RNA granules (MRGs) 1-3. Despite their proposed role in regulating gene expression, little is known about the structural and dynamic properties of MRGs. We investigated the organization of MRGs using fluorescence super-resolution localization microscopy and correlative electron microscopy techniques, obtaining ultrastructural details of their internal architecture. We find that MRGs are organized into nanoscale RNA cores surrounded by a protein shell. Using live-cell super-resolution structured illumination microscopy and photobleaching perturbations, we reveal that MRGs undergo fusion and rapidly exchange components, consistent with liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Furthermore, MRGs associate with the inner mitochondrial membrane and their fusion coincides with membrane remodeling. Inhibition of mitochondrial fission leads to an aberrant distribution of MRGs into concentrated pockets, where they remain as distinct individual units despite their close apposition. Together, our results reveal a role for LLPS in concentrating RNA and its processing proteins into MRGs, which are positioned along mitochondria by membrane dynamics.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInositol pyrophosphates (PP-InsPs) are high-energy cellular molecules involved in different signalling and regulatory responses. Two distinct classes of inositol phosphate kinases responsible for the synthesis of PP-InsPs have been identified in Arabidopsis i.e. ITPKinase (inositol 1,3,4 trisphosphate 5/6 kinase) and PP-IP5Kinase (diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate kinases). Plant PP-IP5Ks are capable of synthesizing InsP8 and were shown to control pathogenic defence and phosphate response signals. However, other roles offered by plant PP-IP5Ks, especially towards abiotic stress, remain poorly understood.\n\nResultsHere, we characterized two Triticum aestivum L. (hexaploid wheat) PPIP5K homologs, TaVIH1 and TaVIH2, for their physiological functions. We demonstrated that wheat VIH proteins could utilize InsP7 as the substrate to produce InsP8, a process that requires the functional VIH-kinase domains. At the transcriptional level, both TaVIH1 and TaVIH2 are expressed in different wheat tissues, including developing grains, but show selective response to abiotic stresses during drought-mimic experiments. Overexpression of TaVIH2-3B homolog in Arabidopsis conferred tolerance to drought stress and rescued the sensitivity of Atvih2 mutants. RNAseq analysis of TaVIH2-3B transgenic lines of Arabidopsis showed a genome-wide reprogramming with remarkable effects on cell-wall biosynthesis genes with enhanced the accumulation of polysaccharides (arabinogalactan, cellulose and arabinoxylan).\n\nConclusionsOverall, this work identifies a novel function of VIH proteins, implying their roles in modulating cell-wall homeostasis genes and providing water-deficit stress tolerance. This work suggests that the plant VIH enzymes could be linked to drought tolerance and also opens up investigations to address the roles of plant VIH derived products in generating drought resistant plants.",

This comprehensive molecular atlas elucidates the biochemical functions of lung cell types and the cell-selective transcription factors and optimal markers for making and monitoring them; defines the cell targets of circulating hormones and predicts local signaling interactions including sources and targets of chemokines in immune cell trafficking and expression changes on lung homing; and identifies the cell types directly affected by lung disease genes and respiratory viruses. Comparison to mouse identified 17 molecular types that appear to have been gained or lost during lung evolution and others whose expression profiles have been substantially altered, revealing extensive plasticity of cell types and cell-type-specific gene expression during organ evolution including expression switches between cell types.

While KSHV establishes latency in virtually all susceptible cell types, LECs support a spontaneous lytic gene expression program with high viral genome copies and release of infectious virus. Here, we investigated the role of PROX1, SOX18 and COUPTF2, drivers of lymphatic endothelial fate during embryogenesis, in this unique KSHV infection program. We found that these factors were co-expressed in KS tumours with the viral lytic marker K8.1, and that SOX18 and PROX1 regulate KSHV infection via two independent mechanisms. SOX18 binds to the viral origins of replication and its depletion or chemical inhibition significantly reduced the KSHV genome copies in LECs. PROX1 interacts with ORF50, the initiator of the lytic cascade, increases lytic gene expression and virus production and its depletion reduces KSHV spontaneous lytic reactivation. Upon lytic replication, PROX1 binds to the KSHV genome in the promoter region of ORF50 and enhances its transactivation activity. These results demonstrate the importance of two endothelial transcription factors in the regulation of the KSHV life cycle and introduce SOX18 inhibition as a potential, novel therapeutic modality for KS.",

    "abstract": "Tauopathies are a class of neurodegenerative diseases associated with pathological tau. Despite many advances in our understanding of these diseases, the direct mechanism through which tau contributes to neurodegeneration remains poorly understood. Previously, our lab implicated the histone demethylase LSD1 in tau-induced neurodegeneration by showing that LSD1 localizes to pathological tau aggregates in Alzheimers disease cases, and that it is continuously required for the survival of hippocampal and cortical neurons in mice. Here, we utilize the P301S tauopathy mouse model to demonstrate that pathological tau can exclude LSD1 from the nucleus in neurons. In addition, we show that reducing LSD1 in these mice is sufficient to highly exacerbate tau-mediated neurodegeneration and tau-induced gene expression changes. Finally, we find that overexpressing LSD1 in the hippocampus of tauopathy mice, even after pathology has formed, is sufficient to significantly delay neurodegeneration and counteract tau-induced expression changes. These results suggest that inhibiting LSD1 via sequestration contributes to tau-mediated neurodegeneration. Thus, LSD1 is a promising therapeutic target for tauopathies such as Alzheimers disease.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWe have made the novel discovery that pathological tau functions through the histone demethylase LSD1 in the Alzheimers disease pathway. Thus, we have identified a mechanism that links tau to the downstream neuronal dysfunction pathways. This step can potentially be targeted therapeutically, after the onset of dementia symptoms, to block the progression of dementia in Alzheimers disease patients.",

The emergence of centromeres resulted in a drastic size increase due to repeat accumulation, and dozens of genes previously located in euchromatin are now embedded in pericentromeric heterochromatin. Metacentric chromosomes secondarily became telocentric in the pseudoobscura subgroup through centromere repositioning and a pericentric inversion. The former (peri)centric sequences left behind shrunk dramatically in size after their inactivation, yet contain remnants of their evolutionary past, including increased repeat-content and heterochromatic environment. Centromere movements are accompanied by rapid turnover of the major satellite DNA detected in (peri)centromeric regions.",

    "abstract": "An object that is looming toward a subject or receding away contains important information for determining if this object is dangerous, beneficial or harmless to them. This information (motion, direction, identity, time-to-collision, size, velocity) is analyzed by the brain in order to execute the appropriate behavioral responses depending on the context: fleeing, freezing, grasping, eating, exploring. In the current study, we performed ultra-high-field functional MRI (fMRI) in awake marmosets to explore the patterns of brain activation elicited by visual stimuli looming toward or receding away from the monkey. We found that looming and receding visual stimuli both activate a large cortical network in frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital cortex in areas involved in the analysis of motion, shape, identity and features of the objects. Looming stimuli strongly activated a network composed of the pulvinar, superior colliculus, prefrontal cortex and temporal cortical areas. This may underlie the existence of an alert network that processes the visual stimuli looming toward their peripersonal space by extracting the crucial information brought by the stimulus and evaluating its potential consequences to the observer. We hypothesize that this network is involved in the planning of protective behaviors (e.g. fleeing or freezing) and in emotional reaction (e.g. anxiety, fear). These findings support the view that this network is preserved through evolution and that the marmoset is a viable model to study visual and multisensory processes by using fMRI to guide further invasive recordings and/or pharmacological manipulations.\\n\\nSignificant statementAn object that is looming toward a subject or receding away contains important information for determining if this object is dangerous, beneficial or harmless to them. Here, we identified the functional network in non-human primates that was activated by visual stimuli looming toward or away from the animals using ultra-high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging. Our findings show that large cortical activations are elicited by both looming and receding visual conditions. However, some activations were specific to the looming condition, suggesting that the integration of cues in the looming direction rely on strong connections between cortical and subcortical areas, which allows primates to react properly for protecting themselves against a potential threat.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT AND INTRODUCTIONMagnetic control of neuronal activity offers many obvious advantages over electric, optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations. A recent series of highly visible papers reported the development of magnetic actuators (i.e., Magneto, MagR and GFP-TRPV1/GFP-ferritin) that appeared to be effective in controlling neuronal firing1-3, yet their action mechanisms seem to conflict with the principles of physics4. We found that neurons expressing Magneto, MagR and GFP-TRPV1/GFP-ferritin did not respond to magnetic stimuli with any membrane depolarization (let alone action potential firing), although these neurons frequently generated spontaneous action potentials. Because the previous study did not establish the precise temporal correlation between magnetic stimuli and action potentials in recorded neurons1-3, the reported magnetically-evoked action potentials are likely to represent mismatched spontaneous firings.",

    "abstract": "Galanin is a neuropeptide expressed by sensory neurones innervating the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Galanin displays inhibitory effects on vagal afferent signalling within the upper GI tract, and the goal of this study was to determine the actions of galanin on colonic spinal afferent function. Specifically, we sought to evaluate the effect of galanin on lumbar splanchnic nerve (LSN) mechanosensitivity to noxious distending pressures and the development of hypersensitivity in the presence of inflammatory stimuli and colitis. Using ex vivo electrophysiological recordings we show that galanin produces a dose-dependent inhibition of colonic LSN responses to mechanical stimuli and prevents the development of hypersensitivity to acutely administered inflammatory mediators. Using galanin receptor (GalR) agonists, we show that GalR1 activation, but not GalR2/3 activation, inhibits mechanosensitivity. The inhibitory effect of galanin on colonic afferent activity was not observed in tissue from mice with dextran sodium sulphate-induced colitis. We conclude that galanin has a marked inhibitory effect on colonic mechanosensitivity at noxious distending pressures and prevents the acute development of mechanical hypersensitivity to inflammatory mediator, an effect not seen in the inflamed colon. These actions highlight a potential role for galanin in the regulation of mechanical nociception from the bowel and the therapeutic potential of targeting galaninergic signalling to treat visceral hypersensitivity.\\n\\nKey point summaryO_LIGalanin inhibits visceral afferent mechanosensitivity to noxious phasic distension of the colon via GalR1.\\nC_LIO_LIGalanin attenuates afferent mechanical hypersensitivity induced by the application of inflammatory mediators.\\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of afferent mechanosensitivity by galanin is not observed in tissues isolated from mice undergoing DSS-induced colitis\\nC_LIO_LIGalanin inhibits the transmission of noxious mechanical stimuli by colonic afferents and its sensitisation by inflammatory mediators highlighting an antinociceptive role for galanin in the colon.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Abnormal ERK/MAPK pathway activity is an important contributor to the neuropathogenesis of many disorders including Fragile X, Rett, 16p11.2 Syndromes, and the RASopathies. Individuals with these syndromes often present with intellectual disability, ADHD, autism, and epilepsy. However, the pathological mechanisms that underly these deficits are not fully understood. Here, we examined whether hyperactivation of MEK1 signaling modifies the development of GABAergic cortical interneurons (CINs), a heterogeneous population of inhibitory neurons necessary for cortical function. We show that GABAergic-neuron specific MEK1 hyperactivation in vivo leads to increased cleaved caspase-3 labeling in a subpopulation of immature neurons in the embryonic subpallium. Adult mutants displayed a significant loss of mature parvalbumin-expressing (PV) CINs, but not somatostatin-expressing CINs, during postnatal development and a modest reduction in perisomatic inhibitory synapse formation on excitatory neurons. Surviving mutant PV-CINs maintained a typical fast-spiking phenotype and minor differences in intrinsic electrophysiological properties. These changes coincided with an increased risk of seizure-like phenotypes. In contrast to other mouse models of PV-CIN loss, we discovered a robust increase in the accumulation of perineuronal nets, an extracellular structure thought to restrict plasticity in the developing brain. Indeed, we found that mutants exhibit a significant impairment in the acquisition of a behavioral test that relies on behavioral response inhibition, a process linked to ADHD-like phenotypes. Overall, our data suggests PV-CIN development is particularly sensitive to hyperactive MEK1 signaling which may underlie neurological deficits frequently observed in ERK/MAPK-linked syndromes.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe RASopathies are a family of neurodevelopmental syndromes caused by mutations that lead to increased RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling and are associated with intellectual disability, epilepsy, and ADHD. We do not fully understand how distinct neuronal subtypes are affected in these syndromes. Here, we show that increased MEK signaling in developing mice promotes the embryonic death of a specific subset of cortical inhibitory neurons that express parvalbumin. Surviving mutant parvalbumin neurons also show significant changes in crucial maturation processes, which coincide with increased seizure susceptibility and profound deficits in behavioral inhibition. These data suggest that deficits in inhibitory circuit development contribute to RASopathy neuropathogenesis and indicate that therapeutic strategies targeting inhibitory interneuron dysfunction may be beneficial for these individuals.",
