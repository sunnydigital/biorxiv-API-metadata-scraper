    "abstract": "We spend much of our life pursuing or avoiding affective experiences. However, surprisingly little is known about how these experiences are represented in the brain and if they are shared across individuals. Here, we explore variations in the construction of an affective experience during a naturalistic viewing paradigm based on subjective preferences in sociosexual desire and self-control using intersubject representational similarity analysis (IS-RSA). We found that when watching erotic movies, intersubject variations in sociosexual desire preferences of 26 heterosexual males were associated with similarly structured fluctuations in the cortico-striatal reward, default mode, and mentalizing networks. In contrast, variations in the self-control preferences were associated with shared dynamics in the fronto-parietal executive control and cingulo-insula salience networks. Importantly, these results were specific to the affective experience, as we did not observe any relationship with variation in preferences when individuals watched neutral movies. Moreover, these results appear to require multivariate representations of preferences as we did not observe any significant results using single summary scores. Our findings demonstrate that multidimensional variations in individual preferences can be used to uncover unique dimensions of an affective experience, and that IS-RSA can provide new insights into the neural processes underlying psychological experiences elicited through naturalistic experimental designs.",

    "abstract": "PurposeAdvances in immunotherapy have revolutionized care for some cancer patients. However, current checkpoint inhibitors are associated with significant toxicity and yield poor responses for patients with central nervous system tumors, calling into question whether cancer immunotherapy can be applied to glioblastoma multiforme. We determined that targeting the CD200 activation receptors (CD200AR) of the CD200 checkpoint with a peptide inhibitor overcomes tumor-induced immunosuppression. We have shown the clinical efficacy of the peptide inhibitor in a trial in companion dogs with spontaneous high-grade glioma; adding the peptide to autologous tumor lysate vaccines significantly increased overall survival relative to tumor lysate alone (median survival of 12.7 and 6.36 months, respectively).\\n\\nExperimental design: This study was developed to elucidate the mechanism of the CD200ARs and develop a humanized peptide inhibitorWe developed macrophage cell lines with each of four CD200ARs knocked out to determine their binding specificity and functional responses. Using proteomics, we developed humanized peptide inhibitors to explore their effects on cytokine/chemokine response, dendritic cell maturation and CMV pp65 antigen response in CD14+ cells. GMP-grade peptide was further validated for activity.\\n\\nResultsWe demonstrated that the peptide specifically targets the CD200AR complex to induce an immune response. Moreover, we developed and validated our humanized peptides for inducing chemokine response, stimulating immature dendritic cell differentiation and significantly enhancing an antigen-specific response. We also determined that the use of the peptide downregulated the expression of CD200 inhibitory and PD-1 receptors.\\n\\nConclusionThese results support consideration of a CD200 peptide ligand as a novel platform for immunotherapy against multiple cancers including glioblastoma multiforme.\\n\\nTranslational relevanceThis report evaluates the ability to modulate the CD200 immune checkpoint by employing synthetic peptides directed as ligands to its paired immune activation receptor. We previously reported the presence of CD200 in the sera and tumor vasculature of patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). We have also shown that a canine CD200 activation receptor ligand extends the lives of companion dogs with high grade glioma. The data we present here show that the human peptide ligand (hCD200ARL) directed to the CD200 activation receptor on CD14+ cells activates immune upregulation through induction of a cytokine response and dendritic cell differentiation. In addition, hCD200ARL downregulates the inhibitory CD200 and PD-1 receptors. These findings provide a basis to evaluate hCD200ARL as a novel immune therapy for patients with GBM. Downregulation of PD-1 suggests that hCD200ARL may also obviate the need for PD1 and PD-L1 directed therapies for GBM and other malignancies.",

    "abstract": "The vast majority of microbes inhabiting oligotrophic shallow subsurface soil environments have not been isolated or studied under controlled laboratory conditions. In part, the challenges associated with isolating shallow subsurface microbes may persist because microbes in deeper soils are adapted to low nutrient availability or quality. Here we use high-throughput dilution-to-extinction culturing to isolate shallow subsurface microbes from a conifer forest in Arizona, USA. We hypothesized that the concentration of heterotrophic substrates in microbiological growth medium would affect which microbial taxa were culturable from these soils. To test this, we diluted extracted cells into one of two custom-designed defined growth media that differed only by a 100-fold difference in the concentration of amino acids and organic carbon. Across both media, we isolated a total of 133 pure cultures, all of which were classified as Actinobacteria or Alphaproteobacteria. The substrate availability dictated which actinobacterial phylotypes were culturable but had no significant effect on the culturability of Alphaproteobacteria. We isolated cultures that were representative of the most abundant phylotype in the soil microbial community (Bradyrhizobium spp.) and representatives of five of the top 10 most abundant Actinobacteria phylotypes, including Nocardioides spp., Mycobacterium spp., and several other phylogenetically-divergent lineages. Flow cytometry of nucleic acid-stained cells showed that cultures isolated on low-substrate medium had significantly lower nucleic-acid fluorescence than those isolated on high-substrate medium. These results show that dilution-to-extinction is an effective method to isolate abundant soil microbes and the concentration of substrates in culture medium influences the culturability of specific microbial lineages.\n\nImportanceIsolating environmental microbes and studying their physiology under controlled conditions is an essential aspect of understanding their ecology. Subsurface ecosystems are typically nutrient-poor environments that harbor diverse microbial communities--the majority of which are thus far uncultured. In this study, we use modified high-throughput cultivation methods to isolate subsurface soil microbes. We show that a component of whether a microbe is culturable from subsurface soils is the concentration of growth substrates in the culture medium. Our results offer new insight into technical approaches and growth medium design that can be used to access the uncultured diversity of soil microbes.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria adapt to cellular needs by changes in morphology through fusion and fission events, referred to as mitochondrial dynamics. Mitochondrial function and morphology are intimately connected and the dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics is linked to several human diseases. In this work, we investigated the role of mitochondrial dynamics in wound healing in the Drosophila embryonic epidermis. Mutants for mitochondrial fusion and fission proteins fail to close their wounds, indicating that the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics is required for wound healing. By live-imaging, we found that loss of function of the mitochondrial fission protein Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) compromises the increase of cytosolic and mitochondrial calcium upon wounding and leads to F-actin defects at the wound edge, culminating in wound healing impairment. Our results highlight a new role for mitochondrial dynamics in the regulation of calcium and F-actin during epithelial repair.\\n\\nSummaryWe show that mitochondrial dynamics proteins are required for epithelial repair. In particular, Drp1 loss-of-function leads to defects in the dynamics of cytosolic and mitochondrial calcium and F-actin upon wounding.",

Low oxygen tension, or hypoxia, is a common feature of solid tumors and hypoxic tumors are often more aggressive and resistant to therapy.

Hypoxia down-regulated mTORc1, reducing its ability to activate transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of v-ATPase, the lysosomal proton pump. Hypoxia prevented epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) degradation in tumor tissues, whereas activation of lysosomes enhanced tumor cell response to anti-EGFR treatment. Our results link oxygen tension and lysosomal activity, provide a molecular explanation of the malignant phenotype associated with hypoxic tumors, and suggest activation of lysosomes may provide therapeutic benefit in RTK-targeted cancer therapy.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryHypoxia suppresses lysosomal activation and proteolysis.",

    "abstract": "Mapping immediate early gene (IEG) expression across intact brains is becoming a popular approach for identifying the brain-wide activity patterns underlying behavior. Registering whole brains to an anatomical atlas presents a technical challenge that has predominantly been tackled using automated voxel-based registration methods; however, these methods may fail when brains are damaged or only partially imaged, can be challenging to correct, and require substantial computational power. Here we present an open source package in R called SMART (semi-manual alignment to reference templates) as an extension to the WholeBrain framework for automated segmentation and semi-automated registration of experimental images to vectorized atlas plates from the Allen Brain Institute Mouse Common Coordinate Framework (CCF).\\n\\nThe SMART package was created with the novice programmer in mind and introduces a streamlined pipeline for aligning, registering, and segmenting large LSFM volumetric datasets with the CCF across the anterior-posterior axis, using a simple  choice game and interactive user-friendly menus. SMART further provides the flexibility to register partial brains or discrete user-chosen experimental images across the CCF, making it compatible with analysis of traditionally sectioned coronal brain slices. In addition to SMART, we introduce a modified tissue clearing protocol based on the iDISCO+ procedure that is optimized for uniform Fos antibody labeling and tissue clearing across whole intact mouse brains. Here we demonstrate the utility of the SMART-WholeBrain pipeline, in conjunction with the modified iDISCO+ Fos procedure, by providing example datasets alongside a full user tutorial. Finally, we present a subset of these data online in an interactive web applet. The complete SMART package is available for download on GitHub.",

To explore dynamic changes in the abundant proteins present in differentiating hair cells, we used nanoliter-scale shotgun mass spectrometry of single cells, each [~]1 picoliter, from utricles of embryonic day 15 chickens. We identified unique constellations of proteins or protein groups from presumptive hair cells and from progenitor cells. The single-cell proteomes enabled the de novo reconstruction of a developmental trajectory. Inference of protein expression dynamics revealed that the actin monomer binding protein thymosin {beta}4 (TMSB4X) was present in progenitors but dropped precipitously during hair-cell differentiation. Complementary single-cell transcriptome profiling showed downregulation of TMSB4X mRNA during maturation of hair cells. We propose that most actin is sequestered by TMSB4X in progenitor cells, but upon differentiation to hair cells, actin is released to build the sensory hair bundle.",

Nevertheless, a clear logic underlying the transcriptional control of neuronal connectivity has yet to emerge. Here, we focused on Drosophila T4/T5 neurons, a class of closely related neuronal subtypes with different wiring patterns. Eight subtypes of T4/T5 neurons are defined by combinations of two patterns of dendritic inputs and four patterns of axonal outputs. Single-cell profiling during development revealed distinct transcriptional programs defining each dendrite and axon wiring pattern. These programs were defined by the expression of a few transcription factors and different combinations of cell surface proteins. Gain and loss of function studies provide evidence for independent control of different wiring features. We propose that modular transcriptional programs for distinct wiring features are assembled in different combinations to generate diverse patterns of neuronal connectivity.",

    "abstract": "Sex differences exist in the regulation of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus in response to hormones and cognitive training. Here we investigated the trajectory and maturation rate of adult-born neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) of male and female rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were perfused two hours, 24 hours, one, two or three weeks after BrdU injection, a DNA synthesis marker that labels dividing progenitor cells and their progeny. Adult-born neurons (BrdU/NeuN-ir) matured faster in males compared to females. Males had a greater density of neural stem cells (Sox2-ir) in the dorsal, but not in the ventral, DG and had higher levels of cell proliferation (Ki67-ir) than non-proestrous females. However, males showed a greater reduction in neurogenesis between one and two weeks after mitosis, whereas females showed similar levels of neurogenesis throughout the weeks. The faster maturation and greater attrition of new neurons in males compared to females suggests greater potential for neurogenesis to respond to external stimuli in males and emphasizes the importance of studying sex on adult hippocampal neurogenesis.\n\nSignificance StatementPreviously studies examining the characteristics of adult-born neurons in the dentate gyrus have used almost exclusively male subjects. Researchers have assumed the two sexes have a similar maturation and attrition of new neurons in the dentate gyrus of adults. However, this study highlights notable sex differences in the attrition, maturation rate and potential of neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus that has significant implications for the field of neuroplasticity. These findings are important in understanding the relevance of sex differences in the regulation of neurogenesis in the hippocampus in response to stimuli or experience and may have consequences for our understanding of diseases that involve neurodegeneration of the hippocampus, particularly those that involve sex differences, such as Alzheimers disease and depression.",

Here we demonstrate that loss of the Drosophila orthologue of tau protein (dtau) significantly rescued in vivo neurodegeneration, motor performance impairments, and shortened life-span in Drosophila models expressing mutant HTT protein with expanded CAGr or the expanded G4C2r. Importantly, expression of human tau (htau4R) restored the disease-relevant phenotypes that were mitigated by the loss of dtau, suggesting a conserved role of tau in neurodegeneration. We further discovered that G4C2r expression increased dtau accumulation, possibly due to reduced activity of BAG3-mediated autophagy. Our study reveals a conserved role of tau in G4C2r-induced neurotoxicity in Drosophila models, providing mechanistic insights and potential therapeutic targets.",

However, the extent to which such history dependency can steer communities towards functionally different states remains a subject of active debate. Using bacterial communities collected from wild pitchers of the carnivorous pitcher plant, Sarracenia purpurea, we tested the effects of history on composition and function across communities assembled in synthetic pitcher plant microcosms. We found that the diversity of assembled communities was determined by the diversity of the system at early, pre-assembly stages. Species composition was also contingent on early community states, not only because of differences in the species pool, but also because the same species had different dynamics in different community contexts. Importantly, compositional differences were proportional to differences in function, as profiles of resource use were strongly correlated with composition, despite convergence in respiration rates. Early differences in community structure can thus propagate to mature communities, conditioning their functional repertoire.",

    "abstract": "Aging is associated with reduced capacity for tissue repair, perhaps the most critical of which is a decline in the ability of aged neurons to recover after injury. Identifying factors that improve the regenerative ability of aging neurons is a prerequisite for therapy design and remains an enormous challenge, yet many of the genes that play a role in regeneration of youthful axons do not regulate axon regeneration in older animals2,9, highlighting the need to identify aging-specific regeneration mechanisms. Previously, we found that increased DAF-16/FOXO activity enhances the regenerative ability of mechanosensory axons in aged animals9. Here we show that DAF-16/FOXO mediates its pro-regenerative effects by upregulating folate metabolism genes via the ZIP-5 bZIP transcription factor. Remarkably, dietary folic acid supplementation improves the regeneration of aging C. elegans axons. Enzymes regulating folate metabolism are also up-regulated in regenerating zebrafish fins, and we show that dietary folic acid supplementation post-amputation enhances fin regrowth in aging zebrafish. Our results demonstrate that boosting folate metabolism is a conserved and non-invasive approach to increase the regenerative capacity of aging neurons and tissues. Given that lower folate status has been linked with reduced cognition in the elderly17, maintaining optimal folate metabolism may be a general strategy to achieve healthy brain aging.",

    "abstract": "Itch, initiated by the activation of sensory neurons, is frequently associated with dermatological or systemic diseases and significantly affects patient quality of life. MrgprA3+ sensory neurons have been identified as one of the major itch-sensing neuronal populations. Mounting evidence has demonstrated that peripheral pathological conditions induce physiological regulations of sensory neurons, which is critical for the maintenance of chronic itch sensation. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not clear. Here we performed RNA sequencing of genetically labeled MrgprA3+ neurons under both naive and allergic contact dermatitis condition. Our results revealed the unique molecular signature of itch-sensing neurons and the distinct transcriptional profile changes that result in response to dermatitis. We found enrichment of nine Mrgpr family members and two histamine receptors in MrgprA3+ neurons, suggesting that MrgprA3+ neurons are the main, direct neuronal target for histamine and Mrgprs agonists. In addition, Ptpn6 and Pcdh12 were identified as novel and highly selective markers of MrgprA3+ neurons. We also discovered that MrgprA3+ neurons respond to skin dermatitis in a way that is unique from other sensory neurons by regulating a combination of transcriptional factors, ion channels, and key molecules involved in synaptic transmission.

    "abstract": "Despite considerable interest in the development of biosensors that can measure analyte concentrations with a dynamic range spanning many orders of magnitude, this goal has proven difficult to achieve. We describe here a modular biosensor architecture that integrates two different readout mechanisms into a single-molecule construct that can achieve target detection across an extraordinarily broad dynamic range. Our dual-mode readout DNA biosensor (DMRD) combines an aptamer and a DNAzyme to quantify ATP with two different mechanisms, which respond to low (micromolar) and high (millimolar) concentrations by generating distinct readouts based on changes in fluorescence and absorbance, respectively. Importantly, we have also devised regulatory strategies to finely tune the target detection range of each sensor module by controlling the target-sensitivity of each readout mechanism. Using this strategy, we report the detection of ATP at a dynamic range spanning 1-500,000 M--more than five orders of magnitude, representing the largest dynamic range reported to date with a single biosensor construct.",

    "abstract": "Single-molecule localization microscopy is a powerful tool in visualizing organelle structures, interactions, and protein functions in biological research. However, whole-cell and tissue specimens challenge the achievable resolution and depth of nanoscopy methods. As imaging depth increases, photons emitted by fluorescent probes, the sole source of molecular positions, were scattered and aberrated, resulting in image artifacts and rapidly deteriorating resolution. We propose a method to allow constructing the in situ 3D response of single emitters directly from single-molecule dataset and therefore allow pin-pointing single-molecule locations with limit-achieving precision and uncompromised fidelity through whole cells and tissues. This advancement expands the routine applicability of super-resolution imaging from selected cellular targets near coverslips to intra- and extra-cellular targets deep inside tissues. We demonstrate this across a range of cellular-tissue architectures from mitochondrial networks, microtubules, and nuclear pores in 2D and 3D cultures, amyloid-{beta} plaques in mouse brains to developing cartilage in mouse forelimbs.",

Helicobacter spp. is known to severely affect mice health, mainly in immunocompromised strains, what may affect experimental outcomes. This study aimed to screen for Helicobacter spp. in mice from four different animal houses in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil using a PCR for 16S ribosomal RNA. A pair of primers was designed to specifically identify Helicobacter species that commonly infect laboratory mice. Following PCR reaction, the expected 375 base pairs (bp) amplification product was purified, sequenced and showed a 95% similarity when compared to deposited sequences of Helicobacter hepaticus and Helicobacter bilis. Then, the presence of Helicobacter spp. in both feces and intestines samples was analyzed. Helicobacter spp DNA was detected in 59.6% of the fecal and 70.17% of the intestine samples. Although Helicobacter spp screening is recommended by institutional animal health monitoring programs worldwide it is still not mandatory by Brazilian animal welfare regulation. Our study, the first to monitor Helicobacter species in laboratory mice in Brazil, demonstrates the possibility of using a low cost, rapid molecular diagnostic test to screen Helicobacter and highlights the importance of regular microbiological verification of mice used for research in Brazilian animal houses.",

    "abstract": "The interaction between synaptic and intrinsic dynamics can efficiently shape neuronal input-output relationships in response to temporally structured spike trains. We use a neuron model with subthreshold oscillations receiving inputs through a synapse with short-term depression and facilitation to show that the combination of intrinsic subthreshold and synaptic dynamics leads to channel-specific nontrivial responses and recognition of specific temporal structures. We employ the Generalized Integrate-and-Fire (GIF) model, which can be subjected to analytical characterization. We map the temporal structure of spike input trains to the type of spike response, and show how the emergence of nontrivial input-output preferences is modulated by intrinsic and synaptic parameters in a synergistic manner. We demonstrate that these temporal input discrimination properties are robust to noise and to variations in synaptic strength, suggesting that they likely contribute to neuronal computation in biological circuits. Furthermore, we also illustrate the presence of these input-output relationships in conductance-based models.\\n\\nAuthor summaryNeuronal subthreshold oscillations underlie key aspects of information processing in single neuron and network dynamics. Dynamic synapses provide a channel-specific temporal modulation of input information. We combine a neuron model that displays subthreshold oscillations and a dynamic synapse to analytically assess their interplay in processing trains of spike-mediated synaptic currents. Our results show that the co-action of intrinsic and synaptic dynamics builds nontrivial input-output relationships, which are resistant to noise and to changes in synaptic strength. The discrimination of a precise temporal structure of the input signal is shaped as a function of the joint interaction of intrinsic oscillations and synaptic dynamics. This interaction can result in channel-specific recognition of precise temporal patterns, hence greatly expanding the flexibility and complexity in information processing achievable by individual neurons with respect to temporal discrimination mechanisms based on intrinsic neuronal dynamics alone.",

Here, we develop a method for inferring translation elongation kinetics from ribosome profiling data using recent advances in the mathematical modelling of mRNA translation. Our method distinguishes between the elongation rate intrinsic to the ribosomes stepping cycle and the actual elongation rate that takes into account ribosome interference. This distinction allows us to quantify the extent of ribosomal collisions along the transcript and identify individual codons where ribosomal collisions are likely. When examining ribosome profiling in yeast, we observe that translation initiation and elongation are close to their optima, and traffic is minimised at the beginning of the transcript to favour ribosome recruitment. However, we find many individual sites of congestion along the mRNAs where the probability of ribosome interference can reach 50%. Our work provides new measures of translation initiation and elongation efficiencies, emphasising the importance of rating these two stages of translation separately.",

    "abstract": "A critical barrier in the treatment of endosomal and lysosomal diseases is the lack of understanding of the in vivo functions of the putative causative genes. We addressed this by investigating a key pair of endocytic adaptor proteins, PH domain containing endocytic trafficking adaptor 1 and 2 (PHETA1/2, also known as FAM109A/B, Ses1/2, IPIP27A/B), which interact with the protein product of OCRL, the causative gene for Lowe syndrome. Here we conducted the first study of PHETA1/2 in vivo, utilizing the zebrafish system. We found that impairment of both zebrafish orthologs, pheta1 and pheta2, disrupted endocytosis and ciliogenesis. In addition, pheta1/2 mutant animals exhibited reduced jaw size and delayed chondrocyte maturation, indicating a role in craniofacial development. Deficiency of pheta1/2 resulted in dysregulation of cathepsin K, which led to an increased abundance of type II collagen in craniofacial cartilages. The abnormal renal and craniofacial phenotypes in the pheta1/2 mutant animals were consistent with the clinical presentations of a patient with a de novo arginine (R) to cysteine (C) variant (R6C) of PHETA1. Expressing the patient-specific variant in zebrafish exacerbated craniofacial deficits, suggesting that the R6C allele acts in a dominant-negative manner. Together, these results provide insights into the in vivo roles of PHETA1/2 and suggest that the R6C variant is contributory to the pathogenesis of disease in the patient.",

    "abstract": "Sperm competition commonly occurs whenever females mate multiply, leading to variation in male paternity success. This can be due to variation in the various traits that might affect sperm competitive ability, which itself depends on both genetic and environmental factors, as well as on genotype-by-environment interactions (GEI). Seminal fluid is a major component of the male ejaculate that is often expected to mediate sperm competition, where different genotypes can differ in their seminal fluid expression as a response to different level of sperm competition (i.e., exhibit GEI). We therefore here focussed on testing for GEI in expression of two recently identified seminal fluid transcripts, suckless-1 and suckless-2, which potentially modulate sperm competitive ability in the simultaneously hermaphroditic flatworm Macrostomum lignano via their effects on manipulating post-mating partner behaviour and ultimately the fate of transferred ejaculates. In addition, we sought to test for GEI in sperm competitive ability, to investigate the relationship between natural variation in the expression of these seminal fluid transcripts generated through GEI and relative paternity success. To do so, we manipulated social group size, which has been shown to successfully alter sperm competition level in M. lignano, in a set of inbred lines (genotypes) and then measured both the expression level of suckless-1 and suckless-2 in focal worms together with their relative paternity success in a standardised sperm competition (P1 & P2) assay. We found GEI for the expression level of suckless-1 and suckless-2, as well as for sperm competitive ability. Moreover, we found a positive relation between the expression of suckless-1 and paternity success. This suggests that natural variation in the expression of this seminal fluid transcript indeed can influence sperm competition outcomes in M. lignano.",

    "abstract": "PurposeDepression is genetically influenced, but the mechanisms that underlie these influences are largely unknown. Recently, shared genetic influences were found between depression and both cognitive ability and educational attainment (EA). Although genetic influences are often thought to represent direct biological pathways, they can also reflect indirect pathways, including modifiable environmental mediations (gene-environment-trait correlations). Here, I tested whether the genetic correlation between cognitive ability and depressive symptoms partly reflects an environmental mediation involving socioeconomic status (SES).\n\nMethodsAs previously done to increase statistical power, and due to their high phenotypic and genetic correlation, EA was used as a proxy for cognitive ability. Summary statistics from a recent genome-wide association study of EA were used to calculate EA polygenic scores. Two independent samples were used: 522 non-Hispanic Caucasian university students from the Duke Neurogenetics Study (277 women, mean age 19.78{+/-}1.24 years) and 5,243 white British volunteers (2,669 women, mean age 62.30{+/-}7.41 years) from the UK biobank.\n\nResultsMediation analyses in the two samples indicated that higher proxy-cognitive ability polygenic scores predicted higher SES, which in turn predicted lower depressive symptoms.\n\nConclusionCurrent findings suggest that some of the genetic correlates of depressive symptoms depend on an environmental mediation and consequently that modifying the environment, specifically through social and economic policies, can affect the genetic influences on depression. Additionally, these results suggest that findings from genetic association studies of depression may be context-contingent and reflect social, cultural, and economic processes in the examined population.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe study of biological age acceleration may help identify at-risk individuals and contribute to reduce the rising global burden of age-related diseases. Using DNA methylation (DNAm) clocks, we investigated biological aging in schizophrenia (SCZ), a severe mental illness that is associated with an increased prevalence of age-related disabilities and morbidities. In a multi-cohort whole blood sample consisting of 1,090 SCZ cases and 1,206 controls, we investigated differential aging using three DNAm clocks (i.e. Hannum, Horvath, Levine). These clocks are highly predictive of chronological age and are known to capture different processes of biological aging.\n\nResultsWe found that blood-based DNAm aging is significantly altered in SCZ with age- and sex-specific effects that differ between clocks and map to distinct chronological age windows. Most notably, differential phenotypic age (Levine clock) was most pronounced in female SCZ patients in later adulthood compared to matched controls. Female patients with high SCZ polygenic risk scores (PRS) present the highest age acceleration in this age group with +4.30 years (CI: 2.40-6.20, P=1.3E-05). Phenotypic age and SCZ PRS contribute additively to the illness and together explain up to 22.4% of the variance in disease status in this study. This suggests that combining genetic and epigenetic predictors may improve predictions of disease outcomes.\n\nConclusionsSince increased phenotypic age is associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality, our findings indicate that specific and identifiable patient groups are at increased mortality risk as measured by the Levine clock. These results provide new biological insights into the aging landscape of SCZ with age- and sex-specific effects and warrant further investigations into the potential of DNAm clocks as clinical biomarkers that may help with disease management in schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin conformation assays such as Hi-C cannot directly measure differences in 3D architecture between cell types or cell states. For this purpose, two or more Hi-C experiments must be carried out, but direct comparison of the resulting Hi-C matrices is confounded by several features of Hi-C data. Most notably, the genomic distance effect, whereby contacts between pairs of genomic loci that are proximal along the chromosome exhibit many more Hi-C contacts that distal pairs of loci, dominates every Hi-C matrix. Furthermore, the form that this distance effect takes often varies between different Hi-C experiments, even between replicate experiments. Thus, a statistical confidence measure designed to identify differential Hi-C contacts must accurately account for the genomic distance effect or risk being misled by large-scale but artifactual differences. ACCOST (Altered Chromatin Conformation STatistics) accomplishes this goal by extending the statistical model employed by DEseq, re-purposing the \\\"size factors,\\\" which were originally developed to account for differences in read depth between samples, to instead model the genomic distance effect. We show via analysis of simulated and real data that ACCOST provides unbiased statistical confidence estimates that compare favorably with competing methods such as diffHiC, FIND, and HiCcompare.

However, whether the expression of CD103 on chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells may augment T cell anti-tumor activity remains unknown. Using a preclinical model, we demonstrate that CD103 engineering of human CAR-T cells significantly improves their therapeutic effects on eliminating pre-established E-cadherin expressing tumor cells in immune deficient NOD.scid.Il2R{gamma}cnull (NSG) mice. Human T cells that were engineered with CAR containing 4-1BB and CD3zeta intracellular signaling domains (named BBz) expressed reduced level of CD103 in mice model. Ex vivo assays confirmed the effect of 4-1BB on repressing CD103 expression in CAR-T cells. On the other hand, we generated CD103 expressing CAR-T cells by introducing the E gene into the CAR structure (named CD103-BBz CAR-T cells). As compared to BBz CAR-T cells, CD103-BBz CAR-T cells produced higher levels of IL-2 and underwent greater expansion in cultures and acquired greater capacity to control the growth and metastasis of E-cadherin expressing lymphoma cells in NSG mice. This effect of CD103-BBz CAR-T cells was associated with their increased capacity to infiltrate into the tumor and persist in vivo, leading to significantly improved overall survival of lymphoma mice. Our findings suggest that engineering tumor-reactive T cells with CD103 may represent a novel strategy to improve adoptive T cells anti-tumor efficacy, and this strategy may have broad implication in the epithelial solid tumor treatment.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LICAR-T cells with 4-1BB costimulatory domain express reduced level of CD103\\nC_LIO_LI4-1BB signaling antagonist TGF-{beta}1 induced CD103 expression\\nC_LIO_LIEctopically expression of CD103 on CAR-T cells enhanced their anti-E-cadherin positive tumor capacity\\nC_LI\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=83 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/727446v1_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (19K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d32377org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bd841corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12c5c98org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@173382d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical Abstract:\\n\\nGraphic Summary: The co-stimulatory molecule 4-1BB within the CAR protein potently suppresses CD103 expression.

    "abstract": "Introductory paragraphGATA binding protein 3 (GATA3) has traditionally been regarded as a lineage-specific transcription factor that drives the differentiation of CD4+ T helper (Th) 2 cells. However, increasing evidence shows that GATA3 is involved in a myriad of processes such as immune regulation, proliferation and maintenance in other T cell and non-T cell lineages. We show here a previously unknown mechanism utilized by CD4+ T cells to increase mitochondrial mass in response to DNA damage through the binding of GATA3, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor {gamma} co-activator-1 (PGC1), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) and superoxide dismutase 3 (SOD3) to the DNA damage repair (DDR) component ATR. These findings extend the pleotropic nature of GATA3 and highlight the potential for GATA3-targeted cell manipulation for clinical interventions.",

    "abstract": "The membrane potential of individual neurons depends on a large number of interacting biophysical processes operating on spatial-temporal scales spanning several orders of magnitude. The multi-scale nature of these processes dictates that accurate prediction of membrane potentials in specific neurons requires utilization of detailed simulations. Unfortunately, constraining parameters within biologically detailed neuron models can be difficult, leading to poor model fits. This obstacle can be overcome partially by numerical optimization or detailed exploration of parameter space. However, these processes, which currently rely on central processing unit (CPU) computation, often incur exponential increases in computing time for marginal improvements in model behavior. As a result, model quality is often compromised to accommodate compute resources. Here, we present a simulation environment, NeuroGPU, that takes advantage of the inherent parallelized structure of graphics processing unit (GPU) to accelerate neuronal simulation. NeuroGPU can simulate most of biologically detailed models 800x faster than traditional simulators when using multiple GPU cores, and even 10-200 times faster when implemented on relatively inexpensive GPU systems. We demonstrate the power of NeuoGPU through large-scale parameter exploration to reveal the response landscape of a neuron. Finally, we accelerate numerical optimization of biophysically detailed neuron models to achieve highly accurate fitting of models to simulation and experimental data. Thus, NeuroGPU enables the rapid simulation of multi-compartment, biophysically detailed neuron models on commonly used computing systems accessible by many scientists.",

We created WikiMedMap as a simple tool that leverages Wikipedia and maps phenotype strings to standard clinical vocabularies. We assessed WikiMedMap by mapping phenotype strings from questionnaires in the UK Biobank and from Mendelian diseases in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database to eight vocabularies: International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), ICD-10, ICD-O, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), OMIM, Disease Database, and MedlinePlus. WikiMedMap outperformed conventional mapping tools in finding potential matches for phenotype strings.

    "abstract": "Vascular response to hypoxia is a major determinant of organ function under stress, which is particularly critical for vital organs such as the heart. This study identifies Vav1 as a key vascular regulator of hypoxia. Vav1 is present in vascular endothelium and is essential for HIF-1 activation under hypoxia. It regulates HIF-1 stabilization through the p38/Siah2/PHD3 pathway. Consequently, Vav1 deficient mice are predisposed to sudden death under cardiac ischemia with increased coronary endothelial apoptosis. Moreover, Vav1 binds to VEGFR1 that carries Vav1 to lysosomes for degradation in normoxia. Hypoxia upregulates Vav1 through inhibition of protein degradation. These findings reveal that regulation of Vav1 by hypoxia is analogous to HIF-1 regulation. Both proteins are constitutively produced allowing for rapid responses when stress occurs, and constantly degraded in normoxia. Hypoxia stabilizes Vav1, which is required for HIF-1 accumulation. Together they mediate the vascular response to hypoxia and maintain tissue homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Molecular motors are nanometer scale proteins involved in various in-tracellular processes such as cargo transport, muscle contraction and cell division. The steps in the chemo-mechanical cycle that use ATP hydrolysis to generate motion along the cytoskeletal tracks can be characterized by stepping rates depending only on the current state, permitting modeling of the cycle as a Markov process. To learn more about the nature of motor mo-tion, cell researchers have conducted in vitro experiments in which molecular motors pull beads along filaments attached to glass slides and their veloc-ity and run length until detachment from the microtubule are recorded. In this article a formula is derived for distance traveled until detachment. Combining this with a standard result for time to absorption for Markov processes gives a formula for velocity. Two kinesins, and two variants of myosin VI, for which there are run length and velocity measurements in the literature are considered. In each case the derived formulas for run length and velocity have a generalized Michaelis-Menten form as functions of ATP concentration. The degrees of the numerator and denominator polynomials increase with the complexity of chemo-mechanical cycle. The degrees of the Michaelis-Menten form determine the maximum number of of reaction rates that can be determined from experimental data on run length and velocity, however consistency conditions may reduce this number and restrict which rates can be determined.",

We posited that melanoma cells acquire metastatic capability by adopting an embryonic-like phenotype, and that a lineage approach would uncover novel metastatic melanoma biology. We used a genetically engineered mouse model to generate a rich melanoblast transcriptome dataset, identified melanoblast-specific genes whose expression contributed to metastatic competence, and derived a 43-gene signature that predicted patient survival. We identified a melanoblast gene, KDELR3, whose loss impaired experimental metastasis. In contrast, KDELR1 deficiency enhanced metastasis, providing the first example of different disease etiologies within the KDELR-family of retrograde transporters. We show that KDELR3 regulates the metastasis suppressor, KAI1, and report an interaction with the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase gp78, a regulator of KAI1 degradation. Our work demonstrates that the melanoblast transcriptome can be mined to uncover novel targetable pathways for melanoma therapy.",

Published records that relate to the distribution of M. alfredi in the south-east Indian and south-west Pacific Oceans are largely restricted to locations where there is a focus on manta ray ecotourism, with little information from elsewhere. Even less is known about the circumglobally distributed oceanic manta ray, Mobula birostris, for which there are few published sighting records. We collated n = 11,703 sighting records from Australian waters and offshore territories for M. alfredi sourced from scientific image databases (n = 10,715), aerial surveys (n = 375) and online reports (n = 613). From collated records, we confirm that the species shows an uninterrupted distribution within Australian coastal waters north of 26{degrees}S on the west coast to 31{degrees}S on the east coast, with a southernmost record at 34{degrees}S. Confirmed locations for M. birostris encompass a latitudinal range of 10-40{degrees}S. Records from more southerly locations relate to warm-water events. Sightings of M. birostris were rare, but were confirmed at several geographically separate locations, probably reflecting its preference for offshore waters. The study clarifies the occurrence and range of each species within coastal waters of the south-east Indian and south-west Pacific Oceans, and highlights regions in northern Australia that are of specific interest for future research into possible movements of individuals between international marine jurisdictions.",

The current measurements revealed three distinct ligand-bound states for MBP in the presence of reducing saccharides. Our biochemical and kinetic analysis reveal that these three states represented MBP bound to different isomers of reducing sugars. These findings shed light on the mechanism of substrate recognition by MBP and illustrate that the nanopore tweezer is a powerful, label-free, single-molecule approach for studying protein conformational dynamics under functional conditions.",

To uncover regulatory genetic variation, we generated chromosome-scale genome assemblies for thirty Arabidopsis thaliana accessions from multiple distinct habitats and characterized species level variation in Conserved Noncoding Sequences (CNS). Our analyses uncovered not only evidence for PAV and positional variation (PosV) but that diversity in CNS is non-random, with variants shared across different accessions.

    "abstract": "The adaptive immune system generates an incredible diversity of antigen receptors for B and T cells to keep dangerous pathogens at bay. The DNA sequences coding for these receptors arise by a complex recombination process followed by a series of productivity-based filters, as well as affinity maturation for B cells, giving considerable diversity to the circulating pool of receptor sequences. Although these datasets hold considerable promise for medical and public health applications, the complex structure of the resulting adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq) datasets makes analysis difficult. In this paper we introduce sumrep, an R package that efficiently performs a wide variety of repertoire summaries and comparisons, and show how sumrep can be used to perform model validation. We find that summaries vary in their ability to differentiate between datasets, although many are able to distinguish between covariates such as donor, timepoint, and cell type for BCR and TCR repertoires. We show that deletion and insertion lengths resulting from V(D)J recombination tend to be more discriminative characterizations of a repertoire than summaries that describe the amino acid composition of the CDR3 region. We also find that state-of-the-art generative models excel at recapitulating gene usage and recombination statistics in a given experimental repertoire, but struggle to capture many physiochemical properties of real repertoires.",

    "abstract": "Chromosomal instability (CIN), the continual gain and loss of chromosomes or parts of chromosomes, occurs in the majority of cancers and confers poor prognosis. Mechanisms driving CIN remain unknown in most cancer types due to a scarcity of functional studies. High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC), the most common subtype of ovarian cancer, is the major cause of death due to gynaecological malignancy in the Western world with chemotherapy resistance developing in almost all patients. HGSC exhibits high rates of chromosome aberrations and knowledge of causative mechanisms is likely to represent an important step towards combating the poor prognosis of this disease. However, very little is known about the nature of chromosomal instability exhibited by this cancer type in particular due to a historical lack of appropriate cell line models. Here we perform the first in-depth functional characterisation of mechanisms driving CIN in HGSC by analysing eight cell lines that accurately recapitulate HGSC genetics as defined by recent studies. We show, using a range of established functional CIN assays combined with live cell imaging and single molecule DNA fibre analysis, that multiple mechanisms co-exist to drive CIN in HGSC. These include supernumerary centrosomes, elevated microtubule dynamics and DNA replication stress. By contrast, the spindle assembly checkpoint was intact. These findings are relevant for developing therapeutic approaches to manipulating CIN in ovarian cancer, and suggests that such approaches may need to be multimodal to combat multiple co-existing CIN drivers.",

    "abstract": "Although immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, only a subset of patients demonstrates durable clinical benefit. Definitive predictive biomarkers and targets to overcome resistance remain unidentified, underscoring the urgency to develop reliable immunocompetent models for mechanistic assessment. Here we characterize a panel of syngeneic mouse models representing the main molecular and phenotypic subtypes of human melanomas and exhibiting their range of responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Comparative analysis of genomic, transcriptomic and tumor-infiltrating immune cell profiles demonstrated alignment with clinical observations and validated the correlation of T cell dysfunction and exclusion programs with resistance. Notably, genome-wide expression analysis uncovered a melanocytic plasticity signature predictive of patient outcome in response to ICB, suggesting that the multipotency and differentiation status of melanoma can determine ICB benefit. Our comparative preclinical platform recapitulates melanoma clinical behavior and can be employed to identify new mechanisms and treatment strategies to improve patient care.",

    "abstract": "The neuron is the fundamental unit of computation in the nervous system, and different neuron types produce different temporal patterns of voltage fluctuations in response to input currents. Understanding the mechanism of single neuron firing patterns requires accurate knowledge of the spatial densities of diverse ion channels along the membrane. However, direct measurements of these microscopic variables are difficult to obtain experimentally. Alternatively, one can attempt to infer those microscopic variables from the membrane potential (a mesoscopic variable), or features thereof, which are more experimentally tractable. One approach in this direction is to infer the ionic densities as parameters of a neuronal model. Traditionally this is done using a Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) method to minimize the differences between features extracted from a simulated neurons membrane potential and the same features extracted from target data. Here, we use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to directly regress generative parameters (e.g., ionic conductances, membrane resistance, etc.,) from simulated time-varying membrane potentials in response to an input stimulus. We simulated diverse neuron models of increasing complexity (Izikivich: 4 parameters; Hodgkin-Huxley: 7 parameters; Mainen-Sejnowski: 10 parameters) with a large range of variation in the underlying parameter values. We show that hyperparameter optimized CNNs can accurately infer the values of generative variables for these neuron models, and that these results far surpass the previous state-of-the-art method (MOO). We discuss the benefits of optimizing the CNN architecture, improvements in accuracy with additional training data, and some observed limitations. Based on these results, we propose that CNNs may be able to infer the spatial distribution of diverse ionic densities from spatially resolved measurements of neuronal membrane potentials (e.g. voltage imaging).",

    "abstract": "How are actions linked with subsequent outcomes to guide choices? The nucleus accumbens, which is implicated in this process, receives glutamatergic inputs from the prelimbic cortex and midline regions of the thalamus. However, little is known about whether and how representations differ across these input pathways. By comparing these inputs during a reinforcement learning task in mice, we discovered that prelimbic cortical inputs preferentially represent actions and choices, whereas midline thalamic inputs preferentially represent cues. Choice-selective activity in the prelimbic cortical inputs is organized in sequences that persist beyond the outcome. Through computational modeling, we demonstrate that these sequences can support the neural implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms, both in a circuit model based on synaptic plasticity, and one based on neural dynamics. Finally, we test and confirm predictions of our circuit models by direct manipulation of nucleus accumbens input neurons. Thus, we integrate experiment and modeling to suggest neural solutions for credit assignment.",

    "abstract": "Microglia become progressively activated and seemingly dysfunctional with age, and genetic studies have linked these cells to the pathogenesis of a growing number of neurodegenerative diseases. Here we report a striking buildup of lipid droplets in microglia with aging in mouse and human brains. These cells, which we call lipid droplet-accumulating microglia (LAM), are defective in phagocytosis, produce high levels of reactive oxygen species, and secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines. RNA sequencing analysis of LAM revealed a transcriptional profile driven by innate inflammation distinct from previously reported microglial states. An unbiased CRISPR-Cas9 screen identified genetic modifiers of lipid droplet formation; surprisingly, variants of several of these genes, including progranulin, are causes of autosomal dominant forms of human neurodegenerative diseases. We thus propose that LAM contribute to age-related and genetic forms of neurodegeneration.",
