    "abstract": "The current paradigm in data science is based on the belief that given sufficient amounts of data, classifiers are likely to uncover the distinction between true and false hypotheses. In particular, the abundance of genomic data creates opportunities for discovering disease risk associations and help in screening and treatment. However, working with large amounts of data is statistically beneficial only if the data is statistically unbiased. Here we demonstrate that amplification methods of DNA samples in TCGA have a substantial effect on short tandem repeat (STR) information. In particular, we design a classifier that uses the STR information and can distinguish between samples that have an analyte code D and an analyte code W. This artificial bias might be detrimental to data driven approaches, and might undermine the conclusions based on past and future genome wide studies.",

    "abstract": "Metabolites have essential roles in microbial communities, including as mediators of nutrient and energy exchange, cell-to-cell communication, and antibiosis. However, detecting and quantifying metabolites and other chemicals in samples having extremes in salt or mineral content using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based methods remains a significant challenge. Here we report a facile method based on in situ chemical derivatization followed by extraction for analysis of metabolites and other chemicals in hypersaline samples, enabling for the first time direct LC-MS-based exo-metabolomics analysis in sample matrices containing up to 2 molar total dissolved salts. The method, MetFish, is applicable to molecules containing amine, carboxylic acid, carbonyl, or hydroxyl functional groups, and can be integrated into either targeted or untargeted analysis pipelines. In targeted analyses, MetFish provided limits of quantification as low as 1 nM, broad linear dynamic ranges (up to 5-6 orders of magnitude) with excellent linearity, and low median inter-day reproducibility (e.g. 2.6%). MetFish was successfully applied in targeted and untargeted exo-metabolomics analyses of microbial consortia, quantifying amino acid dynamics in the exo-metabolome during community succession; in situ in a native prairie soil, whose exo-metabolome was isolated using a hypersaline extraction; and in input and produced fluids from a hydraulically fractured well, identifying dramatic changes in the exo-metabolome over time in the well.",

    "abstract": "Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a critical growth factor involved in the maturation of neurons, including neuronal morphology and synapse refinement. Herein, we demonstrate astrocytes express high levels of BDNFs receptor, TrkB (in the top 20 of protein-coding transcripts), with nearly exclusive expression of the truncated isoform, TrkB.T1 which peaks in expression during astrocyte morphological maturation. Using a novel culture paradigm, we show that astrocyte morphological complexity is increased in the presence of BDNF and is dependent upon BDNF/TrkB.T1 signaling. Deletion of TrkB.T1 in vivo revealed morphologically immature astrocytes with significantly reduced volume and branching, as well as dysregulated expression of perisynaptic genes associated with mature astrocyte functions, including synaptogenic genes. Indicating a role for functional astrocyte maturation via BDNF/TrkB.T1 signaling, TrkB.T1 KO astrocytes do not support normal excitatory synaptogenesis. These data suggest a significant role for BDNF/TrkB.T1 signaling in astrocyte morphological maturation, a critical process for CNS development.",

    "abstract": "Microbes can be engineered to synthesize a wide array of bioproducts, yet production phenotype evaluation remains a frequent bottleneck in the design-build-test cycle where strain development requires iterative rounds of library construction and testing. Here, we present Syntrophic Co-culture Amplification of Production phenotype (SnoCAP). Through a metabolic cross-feeding circuit, the production level of a target molecule is translated into highly distinguishable co-culture growth characteristics, which amplifies differences in production into highly distinguishable growth phenotypes. We demonstrate SnoCAP with the screening of Escherichia coli strains for production of two target molecules: 2-ketoisovalerate, a precursor of the drop-in biofuel isobutanol, and L-tryptophan. The dynamic range of the screening can be tuned by employing an inhibitory analog of the target molecule. Screening based on this framework requires compartmentalization of individual producers with the sensor strain. We explore three formats of implementation with increasing throughput capability: confinement in microtiter plates (102-104 assays/experiment), spatial separation on agar plates (104-105 assays/experiment), and encapsulation in microdroplets (105-107 assays/experiment). Using SnoCAP, we identified an efficient isobutanol production strain from a random mutagenesis library, reaching a final titer that is 5-fold higher than that of the parent strain. The framework can also be extended to screening for secondary metabolite production using a push-pull strategy. We expect that SnoCAP can be readily adapted to the screening of various microbial species, to improve production of a wide range of target molecules.",

Detecting SDEGs plays a critical rolse in molecularly characterizing and identifying tissue or cell subtypes, and facilitating supervised deconvolution of complex tissues. Unfortunately, classic differential analysis assumes a convenient null hypothesis and associated test statistic that is subtype-non-specific and thus, resulting in a high false positive rate and/or lower detection power with respect to particular subtypes. Here we introduce One-Versus-Everyone Fold Change (OVE-FC) test for detecting SDEGs. To assess the statistical significance of such test, we also propose the scaled test statistic OVE-sFC together with a mixture null distribution model and a tailored permutation scheme. Validated with realistic synthetic data sets on both type 1 error and detection power, OVE-FC/sFC test applied to two benchmark gene expression data sets detects many known and de novo SDEGs. Subsequent supervised deconvolution results, obtained using the SDEGs detected by OVE-FC/sFC test, showed superior performance in deconvolution accuracy when compared with popular peer methods.",

    "abstract": "Evolution of bacterial and archaeal genomes is a highly dynamic process that involves extensive gain and loss of genes. Therefore, phylogenetic trees of prokaryotes can be constructed both by the traditional sequence-based methods (gene trees) and by comparison of gene compositions (genome trees). Comparing the branch lengths in gene and genome trees with identical topologies for 34 clusters of closely related bacterial and archaeal genomes, we found that the terminal branches of gene trees were systematically compressed compared to those of genome trees. Thus, sequence evolution seems to be significantly delayed with respect to genome evolution by gene gain and loss. The extent of this delay widely differs among bacterial and archaeal lineages. We develop and explore mathematical models demonstrating that the delay of sequence divergence can be explained by sequence homogenization that is caused by homologous recombination. Once evolving genomes become isolated by barriers that impede homologous recombination, gene and genome evolution processes settle into parallel trajectories, and genomes diverge, resulting in speciation. This model of prokaryotic genome evolution gives a mechanistic explanation of our previous finding that archaeal genomes contain a class of genes that turn over rapidly, before significant sequence divergence occurs, and provides a framework for correcting phylogenetic trees, to make them consistent with the dynamics of gene turnover.",

    "abstract": "Ontogenetic development hinges on the changes in gene expression in time and space within an organism, suggesting that the demands of ontogenetic growth can impose or reveal predictable pattern in the molecular evolution of genes expressed dynamically across development. Here we characterize co-expression modules of the C. elegans transcriptome, using a time series of 30 points from early-embryo to adult. By capturing the functional form of expression profiles with quantitative metrics, we find fastest evolution in the distinctive set of genes with transcript abundance that declines through development from young embryos. These genes are highly enriched for oogenic function (maternal provisioning), are non-randomly distributed in the genome, and correspond to a life stage especially prone to inviability in inter-species hybrids. These observations conflict with the \\\"early conservation model\\\" for the evolution of development, and provide only qualified support for the \\\"hourglass model.\\\" Genes in co-expression modules that peak toward adulthood also evolve fast, being hyper-enriched for roles in spermatogenesis, implicating a history of sexual selection and relaxation of selection on sperm as key factors driving rapid change to ontogenetically distinguishable co-expression modules of genes. These predictable trends of molecular evolution for dynamically-expressed genes across ontogeny might predispose particular life stages, early embryogenesis in particular, to hybrid dysfunction in the speciation process.",

    "abstract": "Data cleaning is an important first step in most statistical analyses, including efforts to map the genetic loci that contribute to variation in complex quantitative traits. Data cleaning is more difficult in multiparent populations (experimental crosses derived from more than two founder strains), as individual SNP markers have incomplete information. We describe our process for cleaning SNP microarray genotype data from Diversity Outbred (DO) mice, illustrated with genotype data from the MegaMUGA array on a set of 291 DO mice. We first consider the proportion of missing genotypes in each mouse, as an indicator of sample quality. We use microarray probe intensities for SNPs on the X and Y chromosomes to check mouse sex. We use the proportion of matching SNP genotypes in pairs of mice to detect sample duplicates. We use a hidden Markov model to calculate genotype probabilities across the genome for each mouse, which we use to estimate the number of crossovers in each mouse, and to identify potential genotyping errors. The estimated genotyping error rate, by mouse sample and by SNP marker, is a useful diagnostic. We also consider the SNP genotype frequencies by mouse and by marker, with markers grouped according to the minor allele frequency in the founder strains. For markers with high apparent error rates, a scatterplot of the allele intensities from the microarray, colored by both observed and predicted genotypes, can be revealing about the underlying cause. But the detection of low-quality samples is more important than the detection of low-quality markers.",

    "abstract": "During meiotic prophase I, double-strand breaks (DSBs) initiate homologous recombination leading to non-crossovers (NCOs) and crossovers (COs). In mouse, 10% of DSBs are designated to become COs, primarily through a pathway dependent on the MLH1-MLH3 heterodimer (MutL{gamma}). Mlh3 contains an endonuclease domain that is critical for resolving COs in yeast. We generated a mouse (Mlh3DN/DN) harboring a mutation within this conserved domain that is predicted to generate a protein that is catalytically inert. Mlh3DN/DN males, like fully null Mlh3-/- males, have no spermatozoa and are infertile, yet spermatocytes have normal DSBs and undergo normal synapsis events in early prophase I. Unlike Mlh3-/- males, mutation of the endonuclease domain within MLH3 permits normal loading and frequency of MutL{gamma} in pachynema. However, key DSB repair factors (RAD51) and mediators of CO pathway choice (BLM helicase) persist into pachynema in Mlh3DN/DN males, indicating a temporal delay in repair events and revealing a mechanism by which alternative DSB repair pathways may be selected. While Mlh3DN/DN spermatocytes retain only 22% of wildtype chiasmata counts, this frequency is greater than observed in Mlh3-/- males (10%), suggesting that the allele may permit partial endonuclease activity, or that other pathways can generate COs from these MutL{gamma}-defined repair intermediates in Mlh3DN/DN males. Double mutant mice homozygous for the Mlh3DN/DN and Mus81-/- mutations show losses in chiasmata that approach levels observed in Mlh3-/- males, indicating that the MUS81-EME1-regulated crossover pathway accounts for some of the increased residual chiasmata observed in Mlh3DN/DN spermatocytes. Our data demonstrate that mouse spermatocytes bearing the MLH1-MLH3DN/DN complex display the proper loading of factors essential for CO resolution (MutS{gamma}, CDK2, HEI10, MutL{gamma}). Despite these functions, mice bearing the Mlh3DN/DN allele show defects in the repair of meiotic recombination intermediates and a loss of most chiasmata.\n\nSUMMARYThe MLH1-MLH3 complex is essential for crossing over in mammalian meiosis. We generated a mutation in mouse MLH3 that alters its conserved endonuclease domain and show that it disrupts crossing over in a manner distinct from the full null Mlh3 mouse, but also results in male infertility.",

Here, we present a pan-cancer study in which we searched for the putative cancer cell-of-origin of 2,550 whole genomes, representing 32 cancer types by matching their mutational landscape to the regional patterns of chromatin modifications ascertained in 104 normal tissue types. We found that, in almost all cancer types, the cell-of-origin can be predicted solely from their DNA sequences. Our analysis validated the hypothesis that high-grade serous ovarian cancer originates in the fallopian tube and identified distinct origins of breast cancer subtypes. We also demonstrated that the technique is equally capable of identifying the cell-of-origin for a series of 2,044 metastatic samples from 22 of the tumor types available as primaries. Moreover, cancer drivers, whether inherited or acquired, reside in active chromatin regions in the respective cell-of-origin. Taken together, our findings highlight that many somatic mutations accumulate while the chromatin structure of the cell-of-origin is maintained and that this historical record, captured in the DNA, can be used to identify the often elusive cancer cell-of-origin.",

    "abstract": "Detecting the most relevant brain regions for explaining the distinction between cognitive conditions is one of the most sought after objectives in neuroimaging research. A popular approach for achieving this goal is the multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) which is commonly conducted through the searchlight procedure as well as a number of other approaches. This is due to advantages of such methods which include being intuitive and flexible with regards to size of the search space. However, these approaches suffer from a number of limitations that lead to misidentification of truly informative voxels or clusters of voxels which in turn results in imprecise information maps. The limitations of such procedures mainly stem from several factors such as the fact that the information value of the search spheres are assigned to the voxel at the center of them (in case of searchlight), the requirement for manual tuning of parameters such as searchlight radius and shape and other optimization parameters, overlooking the structure and interactions within the regions, and the drawbacks of using regularization methods in analysis of datasets with characteristics of common fMRI data. In this paper, we propose a fully data-driven maximum relevance minimum redundancy search algorithm for detecting precise information value of voxel-level clusters within brain regions while alleviating the above mentioned limitations. In order to make the algorithm efficient, we propose an implementation based on principles of dynamic programming. We evaluate and compare the proposed algorithm with the searchlight procedure using both real and synthetic datasets.",

However, nothing is known about how insulin influences excitatory transmission in regions like the nucleus accumbens (NAc), which governs motivational processes in the adult brain. Further, insulin dysregulation that accompanies obesity is linked to cognitive decline, depression, anxiety, and aberrant motivation that also rely on NAc excitatory transmission. Using a combination of whole-cell patch clamp and biochemical approaches we determined how insulin affects NAc glutamatergic transmission. We show that insulin receptor activation increases presynaptic glutamate release via a previously unidentified form of opioid receptor-mediated disinhibition. In contrast, activation of IGF receptors by insulin decreases presynaptic glutamate release in adult male rats. Furthermore, obesity results in a loss of insulin receptor-mediated increases and a reduction in NAc insulin receptor surface expression, while preserving reductions in transmission mediated by IGRFs. These results provide the first insights into how insulin influences excitatory transmission in the adult brain, they provide foundational information about opioid-mediated regulation of NAc glutamatergic transmission, and have broad implications for the regulation of motivation and reward related processes by peripheral hormones.",

Despite displaying some of the most spectacular forms and ecological traits among insects, relatively little attention has been given to understanding their evolution and the drivers of their diversity. We heavily sampled (both in taxa and loci) all major lineages of the Bombycoidea, producing a well-supported phylogeny that identified important evolutionary patterns (e.g., morphology, biogeography, and differences in speciation and extinction). Importantly, analysis of diversification rates highlights the stark increases that exist within the Sphingidae (hawkmoths) and Saturniidae (wild silkmoths). We postulate that these rate shifts are due to differences in the intense selective pressures from insectivorous bats. The study also introduces a new Bombycoidea-specific Anchored Hybrid Enrichment (AHE) probe set, a modified DNA extraction protocol for Lepidoptera specimens from natural history collections, and additional information on the existing AHE bioinformatics pipeline. Our research highlights the flexibility of AHE to generate genomic data from a wide range of museum specimens, both age and preservation method, and will allow researchers to tap into the wealth of biological data residing in natural history collections around the globe.",

    "abstract": "Linear machine learning models \\\"learn\\\" a data transformation by being exposed to examples of input with the desired output, forming the basis for a variety of powerful techniques for analyzing neuroimaging data. However, their ability to learn the desired transformation is limited by the quality and size of the example dataset, which in neuroimaging studies is often notoriously noisy and small. In these cases, it is desirable to fine-tune the learned linear model using domain information beyond the example dataset. To this end, we present a framework that decomposes the weight matrix of a fitted linear model into three subcomponents: the data covariance, the identified signal of interest, and a normalizer. Inspecting these subcomponents in isolation provides an intuitive way to inspect the inner workings of the model and assess its strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, the three subcomponents may be altered, which provides a straightforward way to inject prior information and impose additional constraints. We refer to this process as \\\"post-hoc modification\\\" of a model and demonstrate how it can be used to achieve precise control over which aspects of the model are fitted to the data through machine learning and which are determined through domain information. As an example use case, we decode the associative strength between words from electroencephalography (EEG) reading data. Our results show how the decoding accuracy of two example linear models (ridge regression and logistic regression) can be boosted by incorporating information about the spatio-temporal nature of the data, domain information about the N400 evoked potential and data from other participants.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIWe present a framework to decompose any linear model into three subcomponents that are straightforward to interpret.\\nC_LIO_LIBy modifying the subcomponents before re-assembling them into a linear model, prior information and further constraints may be injected into the model.\\nC_LIO_LIAs an example, we boost the performance of a linear regressor and classifier by injecting knowledge about the spatio-temporal nature of the data, the N400 evoked potential and data from other participants.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "During development, the ectoderm is patterned by a combination of BMP and WNT signaling. Research in model organisms has provided substantial insight, however, there are currently no systems to study this patterning in humans. Further, the complexity of neural plate border specification has made it difficult to transition from discovering the genes involved to deeper mechanistic understanding. Here, we develop an in vitro model of human ectodermal patterning, in which hESCs self-organize to form robust and quantitatively reproducible patterns corresponding to the dorsal-ventral axis of the embryo. Using this platform, we show that the duration of endogenous WNT signaling is a crucial control parameter, and that cells sense relative levels of BMP and WNT signaling in making fate decisions. These insights allowed us to develop an improved protocol for placodal differentiation. Thus, our platform is a powerful tool for studying human ectoderm patterning and for improving directed differentiation protocols.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesHLA alleles affect susceptibility to more than 100 diseases, but the mechanisms to account for these genotype-disease associations are largely unknown. HLA-alleles strongly influence predisposition to ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Both AS and RA patients have discrete intestinal and faecal microbiome signatures. Whether these changes are cause or consequence of the diseases themselves is unclear. To distinguish these possibilities, we examine the effect of HLA-B27 and HLA-DRB1 RA-risk alleles on the composition of the intestinal microbiome in healthy individuals.\\n\\nMethods568 samples from 6 intestinal sites were collected from 107 otherwise healthy unrelated subjects and stool samples from 696 twin pairs from the TwinsUK cohort. Microbiome profiling was performed using sequencing of the 16S rRNA bacterial marker gene. All patients were genotyped using the Illumina CoreExome SNP microarray, and HLA genotypes were imputed from these data.\\n\\nResultsAssociation was observed between HLA-B27 genotype, and RA-risk HLA-DRB1 alleles, and overall microbial composition (P=0.0002 and P=0.00001 respectively). These associations were replicated in the TwinsUK cohort stool samples (P=0.023 and P=0.033 respectively).\\n\\nConclusionsThis study shows that the changes in intestinal microbiome composition seen in AS and RA are at least partially due to effects of HLA-B27 and -DRB1 on the gut microbiome. These findings support the hypothesis that HLA alleles operate to cause or increase the risk of these diseases through interaction with the intestinal microbiome, and suggest that therapies targeting the microbiome may be effective in their prevention and/or treatment.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is one of the major public health problems worldwide, mainly resulting from unhealthy lifestyles and diet. Gut microbiota dysbiosis may also lead to obese humans and animals. Modulating gut bacteria through fecal transplantation, the use of probiotics or certain dietary supplements, could normalize gut microbiota and subsequently alleviate obesity. Daily consumption of Fuzhuan brick tea (FBT) or its extracts have been observed to alleviate obesity in humans and experimental animals. In this study, high-fat diet-induced dysbiosis of gut microbiota in C57BL/6J mice was partially reversed by consumption of Eumtium cristatum, the dominant fungi during the manufacturing and storage of FBT. E. cristatum was able to modulate both gut fungi and bacteria composition, based on the analysis of microbiota composition of mice fecal samples. E. cristatum increased acetate and butyrate-producing bacteria in mice gut, and produced five times more butyrate than both obese and normal mice. Our results suggested that E. cristatum may be used as a fungi probiotic to beneficially modulate gut microbiota and to alleviate obesity in humans.",

    "abstract": "Although emotions often result from dynamic experiences with self-regulation unfolding over time, most research has focused on responses to affective stimuli from a rather static perspective. We studied and analyzed emotion transitions, attempting to reveal brain functions related to affect dynamics. EEG responses were examined during exposure to stable versus changing emotion-eliciting images (static vs dynamic conditions) plus their impact on executive function (EF) assessed with the flanker task. During dynamic conditions, reduced prefrontal to posterior EEG coherence in the beta frequency band and greater left frontal activity occurred compared to the static conditions. Among individuals suffering higher chronic stress, subsequent EF was hindered after dynamic conditions. Furthermore, the adverse effects of emotion transitions on EF for more chronically stressed individuals were mediated by prefrontal-posterior coherence in low beta frequency band during emotional image sequences. Emotion appears to influence EF through changes in large-scale synchronization. Individuals high in chronic stress are vulnerable to these effects.",

We show that this learning rule resembles Hebbian learning with backpropagating action potentials in dendritic neuron models. Moreover, networks of the dendritic neurons can perform a surprisingly wide variety of complex unsupervised learning tasks. Our model not only accounts for the mechanisms of chunking of temporal inputs in the human brain but also accomplishes blind source separation of correlated mixed signals, which cannot be solved by conventional machine learning methods, such as independent-component analysis.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryNeurons use soma-dendrite interactions to self-supervise the learning of characteristic features of various temporal inputs.",

    "abstract": "Isogenic laboratory mouse strains are used to enhance reproducibility as individuals within a strain are essentially genetically identical. For the most widely used isogenic strain, C57BL/6, there is also a wealth of genetic, phenotypic, and genomic data, including one of the highest quality reference genomes (GRCm38.p6). However, laboratory mouse strains are living reagents and hence genetic drift occurs and is an unavoidable source of accumulating genetic variability that can have an impact on reproducibility over time. Nearly 20 years after the first release of the mouse reference genome, individuals from the strain it represents (C57BL/6J) are at least 26 inbreeding generations removed from the individuals used to generate the mouse reference genome. Moreover, C57BL/6J is now maintained through the periodic reintroduction of mice from cryopreserved embryo stocks that are derived from a single breeder pair, aptly named C57BL/6J Adam and Eve. To more accurately represent the genome of todays C57BL/6J mice, we have generated a de novo assembly of the C57BL/6J Eve genome (B6Eve) using high coverage, long-read sequencing, optical mapping, and short-read data. Using these data, we addressed recurring variants observed in previous mouse studies. We have also identified structural variations that impact coding sequences, closed gaps in the mouse reference assembly, some of which are in genes, and we have identified previously unannotated coding sequences through long read sequencing of cDNAs. This B6Eve assembly explains discrepant observations that have been associated with GRCm38-based analyses, and has provided data towards a reference genome that is more representative of the C57BL/6J mice that are in use today.",

These networks operate in a dynamic cellular environment in which the levels of network components may change within cells and across cells. Recent evidence suggests that protein concentration variability could explain cell fate decisions. However, systems with multiple inputs, multiple outputs, and changing input concentrations have not been studied in detail due to their complexity. Here, we take a systems biochemistry approach, combining physiochemical modeling and information theory, to investigate how cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) processes simultaneous input signals within a complex interaction network. We find that changes in input levels affect the amount of information transmitted by the network, as does the correlation between those inputs. This, and the allosteric regulation of COX-2 by its substrates, allows it to act as a signal integrator that is most sensitive to changes in relative input levels.",

    "abstract": "In social interactions, people have to pay attention both to the what and who. In particular, expressive changes heard on speech signals have to be integrated with speaker identity, differentiating e.g. self- and other-produced signals. While previous research has shown that self-related visual information processing is facilitated compared to non-self stimuli, evidence in the auditory modality remains mixed. Here, we compared electroencephalography (EEG) responses to expressive changes in sequence of self- or other-produced speech sounds, using a mismatch negativity (MMN) passive oddball paradigm. Critically, to control for speaker differences, we used programmable acoustic transformations to create voice deviants which differed from standards in exactly the same manner, making EEG responses to such deviations comparable between sequences. Our results indicate that expressive changes on a strangers voice are highly prioritized in auditory processing compared to identical changes on the self-voice. Other-voice deviants generate earlier MMN onset responses and involve stronger cortical activations in a left motor and somatosensory network suggestive of an increased recruitment of resources for less internally predictable, and therefore perhaps more socially relevant, signals.",

    "abstract": "A major cellular catabolic pathway in neurons is macroautophagy/autophagy, through which misfolded or aggregation-prone proteins are sequestered into autophagosomes that fuse with lysosomes, and are subsequently degraded. MAPT (microtubule associated protein tau) is one of the protein clients of autophagy. Given that accumulation of hyperphosphorylated MAPT contributes to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease and other tauopathies, decreasing endogenous MAPT levels has been shown to be beneficial to neuronal health in models of these diseases. A previous study demonstrated that the HSPA/HSP70 co-chaperone BAG3 (BCL2 associated athanogene 3) facilitates endogenous MAPT clearance through autophagy. These findings prompted us to further investigate the mechanisms underlying BAG3-mediated autophagy in the degradation of endogenous MAPT. Here we demonstrate for the first time that BAG3 plays an important role in autophagic flux in the neuritic processes of mature neurons (20-24 days in vitro [DIV]) through interaction with the post-synaptic cytoskeleton protein SYNPO (synaptopodin). Loss of either BAG3 or SYNPO impeded the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes predominantly in the post-synaptic compartment. A block of autophagy leads to accumulation of the autophagic receptor protein SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1) as well as MAPT phosphorylated at Ser262 (p-Ser262). Furthermore, p-Ser262 appears to accumulate in autophagosomes at post-synaptic densities. Overall these data provide evidence of a novel role for the co-chaperone BAG3 in synapses. In cooperation with SYNPO, it functions as part of a surveillance complex that facilitates the autophagic clearance of MAPT p-Ser262, and possibly other MAPT species at the post-synapse. This appears to be crucial for the maintenance of a healthy, functional synapse.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of population structure in natural populations using genetic data is a common practice in ecological and evolutionary studies. With large genomic datasets of populations now appearing more frequently across the taxonomic spectrum, it is becoming increasingly possible to reveal many hierarchical levels of structure, including fine-scale genetic clusters. To analyze these datasets, methods need to be appropriately suited to the challenges of extracting multilevel structure from whole-genome data. Here, we present a network-based approach for constructing population structure representations from genetic data. The use of community detection algorithms from network theory generates a natural hierarchical perspective on the representation that the method produces. The method is computationally efficient, and it requires relatively few assumptions regarding the biological processes that underlie the data. We demonstrate the approach by analyzing population structure in the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana and in human populations. These examples illustrates how network-based approaches for population structure analysis are well-suited to extracting valuable ecological and evolutionary information in the era of large genomic datasets.",
