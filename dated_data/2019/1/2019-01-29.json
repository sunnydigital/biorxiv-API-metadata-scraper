    "abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV), an emerging flavivirus which causes neurodevelopmental impairment to fetuses and has been linked to Guillain-Barre syndrome, continues to threaten global health due to the absence of targeted prophylaxis or treatment. Nucleoside analogues are good examples of efficient anti-viral inhibitors, and prodrug strategies using phosphate masking groups (ProTides) have been employed to improve the bioavailability of ribonucleoside analogues. Here, we synthesized and tested a library of 13 ProTides against ZIKV in human neural stem cells. Strong activity was observed for 2'-C-methyluridine and 2'-C-ethynyluridine ProTides with an aryloxyl phosphoramidate masking group. Conversion of the aryloxyl phosphoramidate ProTide group of 2'-C-methyluridine to a 2-(methylthio)ethyl phosphoramidate completely abolished antiviral activity of the compound. The aryloxyl phosphoramidate ProTide of 2'-C-methyluridine outperformed the hepatitis C virus (HCV) drug sofosbuvir in suppression of viral titers and protection from cytopathic effect, while the former compounds triphosphate active metabolite was better incorporated by purified ZIKV NS5 polymerase over time. Molecular superpositioning revealed different orientations of residues opposite the 2'-fluoro group of sofosbuvir. These findings suggest both a nucleobase and ProTide group bias for the anti-ZIKV activity of nucleoside analogue ProTides in a disease-relevant cell model.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIntracortical microstimulation can be used successfully to modulate neuronal activity. Activity-dependent stimulation (ADS), in which action potentials recorded extracellularly from a single neuron are used to trigger stimulation at another cortical location (closed-loop), is an effective treatment for behavioral recovery after brain lesion in rodents. Neurophysiological changes in cortical communication induced by ADS, and how these changes differ from those induced by open-loop random stimulation (RS) are still not clear.\n\nObjectivesWe investigated the ability of ADS and RS to induce changes in firing patterns in distant populations of neurons in healthy anesthetized rats.\n\nMethodsFor this study we used 23 adult Long-Evan rats, recording from a total of 591 neuronal units. Stimulation was delivered to either forelimb or barrel field somatosensory cortex, using either randomly-timed stimulus pulses or ADS triggered from neuronal spikes recorded in the rostral forelimb area (RFA) of the motor cortex.\n\nResultsBoth RS and ADS stimulation protocols rapidly altered spike firing within RFA compared with no stimulation. Changes consisted of increases in mean firing rates and patterns of spike firing as measured by the revised Local Variation metric. ADS was more effective than RS in increasing short-latency evoked spikes during the stimulation periods, by producing a reliable, progressive increase in stimulus-related activity over time.\n\nConclusionsThese results are critical for understanding the efficacy of electrical microstimulation protocols in altering activity patterns in interconnected brain networks. These data further strengthen the idea that activity-dependent microstimulation, can be used to modulate cortical state and functional connectivity.",

    "abstract": "The number of microbial genome sequences is growing exponentially, also thanks to recent advances in recovering complete or near-complete genomes from metagenomes and single cells. Assigning reliable taxon labels to genomes is key and often a prerequisite for downstream analyses. We introduce CAMITAX, a scalable and reproducible workflow for the taxonomic labelling of microbial genomes recovered from isolates, single cells, and metagenomes. CAMI-TAX combines genome distance-, 16S rRNA gene-, and gene homology-based taxonomic assignments with phylogenetic placement. It uses Nextflow to orchestrate reference databases and software containers, and thus combines ease of installation and use with computational re-producibility. We evaluated the method on several hundred metagenome-assembled genomes with high-quality taxonomic annotations from the TARA Oceans project, and show that the ensemble classification method in CAMITAX improved on all individual methods across tested ranks. While we initially developed CAMITAX to aid the Critical Assessment of Metagenome Interpretation (CAMI) initiative, it evolved into a comprehensive software to reliably assign taxon labels to microbial genomes.

    "abstract": "Learning can cause significant changes in neural responses to relevant stimuli, in addition to modulation due to task engagement. However, it is not known how different functional types of excitatory neurons contribute to these changes. To address this gap, we performed two-photon calcium imaging of excitatory neurons in layer 2/3 of mouse primary visual cortex before and after learning of a visual discrimination. We found that excitatory neurons show striking diversity in the temporal dynamics of their response to visual stimuli during the behavior, and based on this we classified them into transient, sustained, and suppressed groups. Notably, these functionally defined cell classes exhibit different visual stimulus selectivity and modulation by locomotion, and were differentially affected by training condition. In particular, we observed a decrease in the number of transient neurons responsive during behavior after learning, while both transient and sustained cells showed an increase in modulation due to task engagement after learning. The identification of functional diversity within the excitatory population, with distinct changes during learning and task engagement, provides insight into the cortical pathways that allow context-dependent neural representations.",

We applied MeSMLR-seq to haploid yeast, where single DNA molecules represent single cells, and thus we could investigate the combinatorics of many (up to 356) nucleosomes at long range in single cells. We illustrated the differential organization principles of nucleosomes surrounding transcription start site for silently- and actively-transcribed genes, at the single-cell level and in the long-range scale. The heterogeneous patterns of chromatin statuses spanning multiple genes were phased. Together with single-cell RNA-seq data, we quantitatively revealed how chromatin accessibility correlated with gene transcription positively in a highly-heterogeneous scenario.

    "abstract": "Urbanization increasingly changes the ecological conditions for wild animal populations, influencing their demography, reproduction, and behaviour. While studies on the ecological consequences of urbanization frequently document a reduced number and poorer body condition of offspring in urban than in non-urban bird populations, consequences for other components of reproduction are rarely investigated. Mating with partners outside the social pair-bond is widespread in birds, and although theory predicts that the occurrence of extra-pair fertilizations (EPF) may be sensitive to the altered ecological conditions of cities, the effect of urbanization on EPF is poorly known. Here we used data from two urban and two forest populations collected over three years to test whether the frequency of extra-pair offspring (EPO) in great tit broods differed between the habitats. We found that significantly more broods contained EPO in urban habitats (48.9 %) than in forests (24.4 %). In broods with EPO, the number and proportion of EPO was similar in urban and forest broods. These results suggest that females that live in urban habitats are more likely to engage in EPF than those living in forests. Urban environments may either 1) provide more spatiotemporal opportunities to EPF because of higher breeding density and lower or more constant caterpillar supply in cities compared to natural habitats, or 2) enhance the benefits of EPF via increased fertility or due to disrupted quality signals caused by anthropogenic pollution. In addition, 3) females with higher propensity to engage in EPF may more likely settle in urban habitats.",

    "abstract": "Previous simulations indicated reduced nodal root number (NRN) was promising for maize (Zea mays L.) breeding, and were partially confirmed using variation in NRN among inbreds. However, the exact mechanism was unknown, therefore manipulative experiments were conducted in hydroponics and tall solid-media mesocosms with treatments involving no nodal root excision (0% NRE) or excising either 33% or 67% of the nodal roots (NR) as they emerged under high or low levels of nitrogen (N). Reduced NRN was hypothesized to increase elongation of all remaining root classes, increase N acquisition under low N, and increase shoot mass. In both experiments, plants with 67% NRE had 12% and 19% less root fraction of total biomass, 61% and 91% greater lateral-to-axial root length ratio regardless of N levels; and 61% and 182% greater biomass of embryonic roots under low N, compared to 0% NRE for hydroponics and mesocosms studies, respectively. In hydroponics, regardless of NRE level, specific root respiration under high N was 2.6 times of low N, and was greatest at depth. Under low N in mesocosms, plants with 67% NRE had 52% greater shoot biomass, 450% greater root length at depth, and 232% greater deep-injected 15N content in the shoot relative to 0% NRE, however biomass in hydroponics did not differ based on NRE. These results reveal the mechanism by which plants with fewer nodal roots increase N capture and shoot mass by reallocation of biomass to lateral, embryonic, and first whorl nodal roots that increases foraging efficiency in solid media.\n\nSummaryReallocating root biomass from nodal roots to lateral and early-emerging axial roots allows grasses to capture more nitrogen under limiting conditions, including by increasing foraging at depth.",

    "abstract": "MotivationLate onset Alzheimers disease (LOAD) is currently a disease with no known effective treatment options. To address this, there have been a recent surge in the generation of multi-modality data (Hodes and Buckholtz, 2016; Mueller et al., 2005) to understand the biology of the disease and potential drivers that causally regulate it. However, most analytic studies using these data-sets focus on uni-modal analysis of the data. Here we propose a data-driven approach to integrate multiple data types and analytic outcomes to aggregate evidences to support the hypothesis that a gene is a genetic driver of the disease. The main algorithmic contributions of our paper are: i) A general machine learning framework to learn the key characteristics of a few known driver genes from multiple feature-sets and identifying other potential driver genes which have similar feature representations, and ii) A flexible ranking scheme with the ability to integrate external validation in the form of Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) summary statistics. While we currently focus on demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach using different analytic outcomes from RNA-Seq studies, this method is easily generalizable to other data modalities and analysis types.\n\nResultsWe demonstrate the utility of our machine learning algorithm on two benchmark multi-view datasets by significantly outperforming the baseline approaches in predicting missing labels. We then use the algorithm to predict and rank potential drivers of Alzheimers. We show that our ranked genes show a significant enrichment for SNPs associated with Alzheimers, and are enriched in pathways that have been previously associated with the disease.\n\nAvailabilitySource code and link to all feature sets is availabile at https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/EvidenceAggregatedDriverRanking.\n\nContactben.logsdon@sagebionetworks.org",

Current therapeutic approaches are limited and include biologics and steroids such as anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies and corticosteroids, respectively. Significant adverse drug effects can occur for chronic usage and include increased risk of infection in some patients. GPR4, a pH-sensing G protein-coupled receptor, has recently emerged as a potential therapeutic target for intestinal inflammation. We have assessed the effects of a GPR4 antagonist, 2-(4-((2-Ethyl-5,7-dimethylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-3-yl)methyl)phenyl)-5-(piperidin-4-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (GPR4 antagonist 13, also known as NE 52-QQ57) in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced acute colitis mouse model. The GPR4 antagonist 13 inhibited intestinal inflammation. The clinical parameters such as body weight loss and fecal score were reduced in the GPR4 antagonist 13 treatment group compared to vehicle control. Macroscopic disease indicators such as colon shortening, splenic expansion, and mesenteric lymph node enlargement were all reduced in severity in the GPR4 antagonist 13 treated mice. Histopathological features of active colitis were alleviated in GPR4 antagonist 13 treatment groups compared to vehicle control. Finally, inflammatory gene expression in the colon tissues and vascular adhesion molecule expression in the intestinal endothelia were attenuated by GPR4 antagonist 13. Our results indicate that GPR4 antagonist 13 provides a protective effect in the DSS-induced acute colitis mouse model, and inhibition of GPR4 can be explored as a novel anti-inflammatory approach.",

    "abstract": "In an individualized animal society, social bonds can foster cooperation and enhance survival and reproduction. Cooperative bonds often exist among kin, but nonkin can also develop high-investment cooperative bonds that share similarities with human friendship. How do such bonds form? One theory suggests that strangers should  test the waters of a new relationship by making small initial cooperative investments and gradually escalating them with good partners. This  raising-the-stakes strategy is demonstrated by human strangers in short-term economic games, but it remains unclear whether it applies to helping in a natural long-term social bond. Here we show evidence that unfamiliar vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) selectively escalate low-cost investments in allogrooming before developing higher-cost food-sharing relationships. We introduced females from geographically distant sites in pairs or groups and observed that bats established new reciprocal grooming relationships, and that increasing grooming rates predicted the occurrence of first food donations, at which point grooming rates no longer increased. New food-sharing relationships emerged reciprocally in 14% of female pairs, typically over 10-15 months, and developed faster when strangers lacked alternative familiar partners. A gradual grooming-to-sharing transition among past strangers suggests that  raising the stakes might be more evident when tracking multiple cooperative behaviours as new relationships form, rather than measuring a single behavior in an established relationship.  Raising the stakes could play a similar underappreciated role across a broader spectrum of social decisions with long-term consequences, such as joining a new social group or forming a long-term pair-bond.\n\nSignificance statementVampire bats form long-term cooperative social bonds that involve reciprocal food sharing. How do two unrelated bats go from being strangers to having a high-investment food-sharing relationship? We introduced unfamiliar bats and found evidence that low-cost grooming paves the way for higher-cost food donations. Food sharing emerged in a reciprocal fashion and it emerged faster when two strangers did not have access to their original groupmates. The bats that formed new food-sharing relationships had a history of escalating reciprocal grooming up until the food sharing began. Our finding that unfamiliar nonkin vampire bats appear to gradually and selectively transition from low-cost to high-cost cooperative behaviors is the first evidence that nonhuman individuals  raise the stakes when forming new cooperative relationships.",

    "abstract": "Genome-resolved environmental metagenomic sequencing has uncovered substantial previously unrecognized microbial diversity relevant for understanding the ecology and evolution of the biosphere, providing a more nuanced view of the distribution and ecological significance of traits including phototrophy across diverse niches. Recently, the capacity for bacteriochlorophyll-based anoxygenic photosynthesis has been found in the uncultured bacterial WPS-2 clade that are in close association with boreal moss. Here, we use phylogenomic analysis to investigate the diversity and evolution of phototrophic WPS-2. We demonstrate that phototrophic WPS-2 show significant genetic and metabolic divergence from other phototrophic and non-phototrophic lineages. The genomes of these organisms encode a completely new family of anoxygenic Type II photochemical reaction centers and other phototrophy-related proteins that are both phylogenetically and structurally distinct from those found in previously described phototrophs. We propose the name Candidatus Palusbacterota for the phylum-level aerobic WPS-2 clade which contains phototrophic lineages, from the Latin for \"bog bacteria\", distinguishing it from the anaerobic, non-phototrophic sister phylum Candidatus Eremiobacterota for \"desert bacteria\", typically found in dry environments.",

    "abstract": "Cleft lip with/without cleft palate (CLP) is a common craniofacial malformation with complex etiologies, reflecting both genetic and environmental factors. Most of the suspected genetic risk for CLP has yet to be identified. To further classify risk loci and estimate the contribution of rare variants, we sequenced the exons in 49 candidate genes in 323 CLP cases and 211 non-malformed controls. Our findings indicated that rare, protein-altering variants displayed markedly higher burdens in CLP cases at relevant loci. First, putative loss-of-function mutations (nonsense, frameshift) were significantly enriched among cases: 13 of 323 cases (~4%) harbored such alleles within these 49 genes, versus one such change in controls (p = 0.01). Second, in gene-level analyses, the burden of rare alleles showed greater case-association for several genes previously implicated in cleft risk. For example, BHMT displayed a 10-fold increase in protein-altering variants in CLP cases (p = 0.03), including multiple case occurrences of a rare frameshift mutation (K400fs). Other loci with greater rare, coding allele burdens in cases were in signaling pathways relevant to craniofacial development (WNT9B, BMP4, BMPR1B) as well as the methionine cycle (MTRR). We conclude that rare coding variants may confer risk for isolated CLP.",

    "abstract": "Better understanding of essential cellular functions in pathogenic bacteria is important for the development of more effective antimicrobial agents. We performed a comprehensive identification of essential genes in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the major causative agent of tuberculosis, using a combination of transposon insertion sequencing (Tn-seq) and comparative genomic analysis. To identify conditional essential genes by Tn-seq, we used media with different nutrient composition. Although many conditional gene essentialities were affected by the presence of relevant nutrient sources, we also found that the essentiality of genes in a subset of metabolic pathways was unaffected by metabolites. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that not all essential genes identified by Tn-seq were fully conserved within the M. tuberculosis complex including some existing anti-tubercular drug target genes. In addition, we utilized an available M. tuberculosis genome-scale metabolic model, iSM810, to predict M. tuberculosis gene essentiality in silico. Comparing the sets of essential genes experimentally identified by Tn-seq to those predicted in silico reveals the capabilities and limitations of gene essentiality predictions highlighting the complexity of M. tuberculosis essential metabolic functions. This study provides a promising platform to study essential cellular functions in M. tuberculosis.\n\nAuthor SummaryMycobacterium tuberculosis causes 10 million cases of tuberculosis (TB) each year resulting in over one million deaths. TB therapy is challenging because it requires a minimum of six months of treatment with multiple drugs. Protracted treatment times and the emergent spread of drug resistant TB necessitate the identification of novel targets for drug discovery to curb this global health threat. Essential functions, defined as those indispensable for growth and/or survival, are potential targets for new antimicrobial drugs. In this study, we aimed to define gene essentialities of M. tuberculosis on a genome-wide scale to comprehensively identify potential targets for drug discovery. We utilized a combination of experimental (functional genomics) and in silico approaches (comparative genomics and flux balance analysis). Our functional genomics approach identified sets of genes whose essentiality was affected by nutrient availability. Comparative genomics revealed that not all essential genes were fully conserved within the M. tuberculosis complex. Comparing sets of essential genes identified by functional genomics to those predicted by flux balance analysis highlighted gaps in current knowledge regarding M. tuberculosis metabolic capabilities. Thus, our study identifies numerous potential anti-tubercular drug targets and provides a comprehensive picture of the complexity of M. tuberculosis essential cellular functions.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria often live in spatially structured groups such as biofilms. In these groups, cells can collectively generate gradients through the uptake and release of compounds. In turn, individual cells adapt their activities to the environment shaped by the whole group. Here we studied how these processes can generate phenotypic variation in clonal populations and how this variation contributes to the resilience of the population to antibiotics. We grew two-dimensional populations of Escherichia coli in microfluidic chambers where limiting amounts of glucose were supplied from one side. We found that the collective metabolic activity of cells created microscale gradients where nutrient concentration varied over a few cell lengths. As a result, growth rates and gene expression levels varied strongly between cells close in space. Furthermore, we found evidence for a metabolic cross-feeding interaction between glucose fermenting and acetate respiring subpopulations. Finally, we found that the populations were able to survive an antibiotic pulse that was lethal in well-mixed conditions, likely due to the presence of a slow growing subpopulation. Our work shows that emergent metabolic gradients can have important consequences for the functionality of bacterial populations as they create opportunities for metabolic interactions and increase the populations tolerance to environmental stressors.",

Here we report the functional and structural characterization of the siDNA-guided DNA-targeting pAgo from the mesophilic bacterium Clostridium butyricum (CbAgo). CbAgo displays a preference for siDNAs that have a deoxyadenosine at the 5-end and thymidines in the sub-seed segment (siDNA nucleotides 2-4). Furthermore, CbAgo mediates DNA-guided DNA cleavage of AT-rich double stranded DNA at moderate temperatures (37{degrees}C).

An uncharted frontier for in silico biology is the ability to simulate cellular processes using these observed geometries. However, this will require a system for going from EM images to 3D volume meshes which can be used in finite element simulations.\n\nMethodsIn this paper, we develop an end-to-end pipeline for this task by adapting and extending computer graphics mesh processing and smoothing algorithms. Our workflow makes use of our recently rewritten mesh processing software, GAMer 2, which implements several mesh conditioning algorithms and serves as a platform to connect different pipeline steps.\n\nResultsWe apply this pipeline to a series of electron micrographs of dendrite morphology explored at three different length scales and show that the resultant meshes are suitable for finite element simulations.\n\nConclusionOur pipeline, which consists of free and open-source community driven tools, is a step towards routine physical simulations of biological processes in realistic geometries.\n\nSignificanceWe posit that a new frontier at the intersection of computational technologies and single cell biology is now open. Innovations in algorithms to reconstruct and simulate cellular length scale phenomena based on emerging structural data will enable realistic physical models and advance discovery.",

It has high global morbidity and mortality among HIV patients and none-HIV carriers with 99% and 95% respectively. Furthermore, the increasing prevalence of undesired toxicity profile of antifungal, multi-drug resistant organism, and the scarcity of FDA authorized vaccines, where the hallmark in the present days. This study was undertaken to design a reliable multi-epitope peptide vaccine against highly conserved immunodominant heat shock 70KDa protein of Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii that covers a considerable digit of the world population through implementing computational vaccinology approach.\n\nMaterials and MethodsA total of 38 Sequences of Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubiis heat shock 70KDa protein were retrieved from NCBI protein database. Different prediction tools were used to analyze the aforementioned protein at Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) to discriminate the most promising T-cell and B-cell epitopes. Then the proposed epitopes were subjected to Population coverage analysis tool to compute global populations coverage. Finally, the projected epitopes were ranked based on their scores and binding modes through using Moe 2007 program.\n\nOutstanding Results and ConclusionOur prime vaccine candidate was a putative ten promising epitopes (ANYVQASEK, NYVQASEK, KSVEKPAS, TPQQPPAQ, YVYDTRGKL, FYRQGAFEL, FTQLVAAYL, FFGGKVLNF, FDYALVQHF, and FINAQLVDV). Together, these epitopes are forecasted to trigger T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and immunological memory with overall population coverage above 90%. Accordingly, our in silico vaccine is expected to be the future multi-epitope peptide vaccine against Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubiis heat shock 70KDa protein that covers a significant figure of the entire world citizens. Therefore, there is a definite need for experimental validation for the carefully chosen vaccine candidates in vitro and in vivo to fortify their antigenic and immunogenic potentials. Additionally, further computational studies are needed to be conducted in pathogens-derived Heat shock 70KDa protein family, as it believed to find universal epitopes that might be overlapped with other pathogens-derived Hsp70.",

Upon initiation of myogenesis from primary myoblasts, MTF1 expression increased, as did nuclear localization. Mtf1 knockdown impaired differentiation, while addition of non-toxic concentrations of Cu+ enhanced MTF1 expression and promoted myogenesis. Cu+ bound stoichiometrically to a C-terminus tetra-cysteine of MTF1. MTF1 bound to chromatin at the promoter regions of myogenic genes and binding was stimulated by copper.

However, comparative studies have consistently failed to find any strong correlation between measures of census population size and genetic diversity. Instead, a recent comparative study across several animal phyla identified propagule size as the strongest predictor of genetic diversity, suggesting that r-strategists that produce many offspring but invest little in each, have greater long-term effective population sizes. We present a comparison of genome-wide levels of genetic diversity across 38 species of European butterflies (Papilionoidea). We show that across butterflies, genetic diversity varies over an order of magnitude and that this variation cannot be explained by differences in abundance, fecundity, host plant use or geographic range. Instead, we find that genetic diversity is negatively correlated with body size and positively with the length of the genetic map. This suggests that variation in genetic diversity is determined both by fluctuation in Ne and the effect of selection on linked neutral sites.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary changes in enhancers are widely associated with variation in human traits and diseases. However, studies comprehensively quantifying levels of selection on enhancers at multiple evolutionary time points during recent human evolution and how enhancer evolution varies across human tissues are lacking. To address these questions, we integrated a dataset of 41,561 transcribed enhancers active in 41 different human tissues (FANTOM Consortium) with whole genome sequences of 1,668 individuals from the African, Asian, and European populations (1000 Genomes Project). Our analyses based on four different metrics (Tajimas D, FST, H12, nSL) showed that ~5.90% of enhancers considered showed evidence of recent positive selection and that genes associated with enhancers under positive selection are enriched for diverse immune-related functions. The distributions of these metrics for brain and testis enhancers were often statistically significantly different compared to those of other tissues; the same was true for brain and testis enhancers that are tissue-specific compared to those that are tissue-broad and for testis enhancers associated with tissue-enriched and non-tissue-enriched genes. These differences varied considerably across metrics and tissues and were generally due to changes in distributions shapes rather than shifts in their values. These results suggest that many human enhancers experienced recent positive selection throughout multiple time periods in human evolutionary history, that this selection occurred in a tissue-dependent and immune-related functional context, and that much like the evolution of their coding counterparts, the evolution of brain and testis enhancers has been markedly different from that of enhancers in other tissues.",

We applied this to dissect MYC regulation in human pluripotent stem cells. Insertion of STITCH between MYC and the enhancer down-regulated MYC and affected its target transcriptome. Progressive mutagenesis of STITCH led to preferential escalation of the gene-enhancer interaction, corroborating the strong insulation ability of STITCH. The STITCH insertion altered epigenetic states around MYC. Time-course analysis by drug induction uncovered deposition and removal of H3K27me3 repressive marks follows and reflects, but does not precede and determine, the expression change.

    "abstract": "Proper partitioning of homologous chromosomes during meiosis relies on the coordinated execution of multiple interconnected events: Homologs must locate, recognize and align with their correct pairing partners. Further, homolog pairing must be coupled to assembly of the synaptonemal complex (SC), a meiosis-specific tripartite structure that maintains stable associations between the axes of aligned homologs and regulates formation of crossovers between their DNA molecules to create linkages that enable their segregation. Here we identify HAL-3 (Homolog Alignment 3) as an important player in coordinating these key events during C. elegans meiosis. HAL-3 and the previously-identified HAL-2 are interacting and interdependent components of a protein complex that localizes to the nucleoplasm of germ cells. hal-3 (or hal-2) mutants exhibit multiple meiotic prophase defects including failure to establish homolog pairing, inappropriate loading of SC subunits onto unpaired chromosome axes, and premature loss of synapsis checkpoint protein PCH-2. Further, loss of hal function results in misregulation of the subcellular localization and activity of polo-like kinases (PLK-1 and PLK-2), which dynamically localize to different defined subnuclear sites during wild-type prophase progression to regulate distinct cellular events. Moreover, loss of PLK-2 activity partially restores tripartite SC structure in a hal mutant background, suggesting that the defect in pairwise SC assembly in hal mutants reflects inappropriate PLK activity. Together our data support a model in which the nucleoplasmic HAL-2/HAL-3 protein complex constrains both localization and activity of meiotic Polo-like kinases, thereby preventing premature interaction with stage-inappropriate targets.",

    "abstract": "Intra-chromosomal or inter-chromosomal genomic rearrangements often lead to speciation (1). Loss or gain of a centromere leads to alterations in chromosome number in closely related species. Thus, centromeres can enable tracing the path of evolution from the ancestral to a derived state (2). The Malassezia species complex of the phylum Basiodiomycota shows remarkable diversity in chromosome number ranging between six and nine chromosomes (3-5). To understand these transitions, we experimentally identified all eight centromeres as binding sites of an evolutionarily conserved outer kinetochore protein Mis12/Mtw1 in M. sympodialis. The 3 to 5 kb centromere regions share an AT-rich, poorly transcribed core region enriched with a 12 bp consensus motif. We also mapped nine such AT-rich centromeres in M. globosa and the related species Malassezia restricta and Malassezia slooffiae. While eight predicted centromeres were found within conserved synteny blocks between these species and M. sympodialis, the remaining centromere in M. globosa (MgCEN2) or its orthologous centromere in M. slooffiae (MslCEN4) and M. restricta (MreCEN8) mapped to a synteny breakpoint compared with M. sympodialis. Taken together, we provide evidence that breakage and loss of a centromere (CEN2) in an ancestral Malassezia species possessing nine chromosomes resulted in fewer chromosomes in M. sympodialis. Strikingly, the predicted centromeres of all closely related Malassezia species map to an AT-rich core on each chromosome that also shows enrichment of the 12 bp sequence motif. We propose that centromeres are fragile AT-rich sites driving karyotype diversity through breakage and inactivation in these and other species.\n\nSignificance statementThe number of chromosomes can vary between closely related species. Centromere loss destabilizes chromosomes and results in reduced number of chromosomes to drive speciation. A series of evidence from studies on various cancers suggest that an imbalance in kinetochore-microtubule attachments results in breaks at the centromeres. To understand if such events can cause chromosome number changes in nature, we studied six species of Malassezia, of which three possess eight chromosomes and others have nine chromosomes each. We find signatures of chromosome breakage at the centromeres in organisms having nine chromosomes. We propose that the break at the centromere followed by fusions of acentric chromosomes to other chromosomes could be a plausible mechanism shaping the karyotype of Malassezia and related organisms.\n\nClassificationBiological sciences, Genetics",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTThe incorporation of stratigraphic data into phylogenetic analysis has a long history of debate, but is not currently standard practice for palaeontologists. Bayesian tip-dating (or morphological clock) phylogenetic methods have returned these arguments to the spotlight, but how tip-dating affects the recovery of evolutionary relationships has yet to be fully explored. Here we show, through analysis of several datasets with multiple phylogenetic methods, that topologies produced by tip-dating are outliers when compared to topologies produced by parsimony and undated Bayesian methods, which retrieve broadly similar trees. Unsurprisingly, trees recovered by tip-dating have better fit to stratigraphy than trees recovered by other methods, due to trees with better stratigraphic fit being assigned a higher prior probability. Differences in stratigraphic fit and tree topology between tip-dating and other methods appear to be concentrated in parts of the tree with weaker character signal and a stronger influence of the prior, as shown by successive deletion of the most incomplete taxa from a sauropod dataset. Tip-dating applied to Mesozoic mammals firmly rejects a monophyletic Allotheria, and strongly supports diphyly of haramiyidans, with the late Triassic Haramiyavia and Thomasia forming a clade with tritylodontids, which is distant from the middle Jurassic euharamiyidans. This result is not sensitive to the controversial age of the eutherian Juramaia. A Test of the age of Juramaia using a less restrictive prior reveals strong support from the data for an Early Cretaceous age. Our results suggest that tip-dating incorporates stratigraphic data in an intuitive way, with good stratigraphic fit a prior expectation that can be overturned by strong evidence from character data.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Sotalol is a Vaughan-Williams Class III antiarrhythmic medication that is commonly used in the management of both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Like others in this class, sotalol carries a risk of the potentially lethal arrhythmia torsade de pointes due to its effect of prolonging the QT interval on ECG. For this reason, many centers admit patients for telemetry monitoring during the initial 2-3 days of dosing. However, despite its widespread use, little information is available about the dosing protocols used during this initiation process. In this multicenter investigation, we examine the characteristics of various dose protocols in 213 patients who initiated sotalol over a 4-year period. Of these patients, over 90% were able to successfully complete the dosing regimen (i.e., were discharged on the medication). Significant bradycardia, excessive QT prolongation, and ineffectiveness were the main reasons for failed completion. We found that any dose adjustment was one of the strongest univariate predictors of successful initiation (OR 6.6, 95%CI 1.3 - 32.7, p = 0.021), while initial dose, indication, and resting heart rate or QT interval on baseline ECG did not predict successful initiation. Several predictors of any dose adjustment were identified, and included diabetes, hypertension, presence of pacemaker, heart failure diagnosis, and depressed LV ejection fraction. Using marginal structural models (i.e., inverse probability weighting based on probability of a dose adjustment), we verified that these factors also predicted successful initiation via preventing any dose adjustment, and suggests that consideration of these factors may result in higher likelihood of successful initiation in future investigations. In conclusion, we found that the majority of patients admitted for sotalol initiation are successfully discharged on the medication, often without a single adjustment in the dose. Our findings suggest that several factors predicting lack of dose adjustment could be used clinically to identify patients who could potentially undergo outpatient initiation, although prospective studies are needed to verify this approach.",

    "abstract": "Springtails (Collembola) are ancient close relatives of the insects. The eversible vesicles are their unique paired transporting organs, which consist of an epithelium located inside a tube-like structure on the first abdominal segment called the collophore. The vesicles can be protruded out of the collophore and several lines of evidence indicate that they have a vital function in water uptake and ion balance. However, the amount of water absorbed by the vesicles and which other ions apart from sodium are transported remain unknown. Using Orchesella cincta as a model, we developed protocols for two assays that enabled us to study water and ion movement across the eversible vesicles in whole living springtails. Using an inverse Ramsay assay we demonstrate that the eversible vesicles absorb water from a droplet applied onto their surface. Using the scanning ion-selective electrode technique (SIET) we show that the vesicles absorb Na+ and Cl- from the bathing medium, secrete NH4+, and both absorb and secrete K+, H+ is secreted at a low level in the anterior part and absorbed at the posterior. We did not detect transport of Ca2+ at significant levels. The highest flux was the absorption of Cl-, and the magnitude of ion fluxes were significantly lower in fully hydrated springtails. Our data demonstrate that the eversible vesicles are a transporting epithelium functioning in osmo- and ionoregulation, nitrogenous waste excretion and likely acid-base balance.",

    "abstract": "Laccases can catalyze monoelectronic oxidation and have shown to have an increasing value in industrial application. In this study, as identified by Native-PAGE and ESI-MS/MS, ascomycetous fungus Setosphaeria turcica produced three laccase isozymes: Stlac1, Stlac2, and Stlac6. Stlac2 was heterologously expressed in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic expression systems. The eukaryotic recombinant Stlac2 expressed in Pichia pastoris was inactive, and also showed a higher molecular weight than predicted because of glycosylation. The depression of laccase activity was attributable to the incorrect glycosylation at Asn97. Stlac2 expressed in Escherichia coli and after being renaturated from the inclusion body, the recombinant Stlac2 exhibited activity of 28.23 U/mg with 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) as the substrate. The highest activity was observed at pH of 4.5 and the temperature of 60 {degrees}C. The activity of recombinant Stlac2 was inhibited by 10 mM Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+, and increased by 10 mM of Fe3+ with a relatively activity of 315% compared with no addition. Cu2+ did not affect enzyme activity. Recombinant Stlac2 was capable of decolorizing 67.08% of 20 mg/L malachite green in 15 min without any mediators. It is suggested that Stlac2 has potential industrial applications.\n\nImportanceSetosphaeria turcica, an ascomycetous fungus causes northern corn leaf blight, product three laccase isozymes identified by Native-PAGE and ESI-MS/MS.

    "abstract": "MotivationRecent efforts to describe the human epigenome have yielded thousands of uniformly processed epigenomic and transcriptomic data sets. These data sets characterize a rich variety of biological activity in hundreds of human cell lines and tissues (\"biosamples\"). Understanding these data sets, and specifically how they differ across biosamples, can help explain many cellular mechanisms, particularly those driving development and disease. However, due primarily to cost, the total number of assays that can be performed is limited. Previously described imputation approaches, such as Avocado, have sought to overcome this limitation by predicting genome-wide epigenomics experiments using learned associations among available epigenomic data sets. However, these previous imputations have focused primarily on measurements of histone modification and chromatin accessibility, despite other biological activity being crucially important.\n\nResultsWe applied Avocado to a data set of 3,814 tracks of data derived from the ENCODE compendium, spanning 400 human biosamples and 84 assays. The resulting imputations cover measurements of chromatin accessibility, histone modification, transcription, and protein binding. We demonstrate the quality of these imputations by comprehensively evaluating the models predictions and by showing significant improvements in protein binding performance compared to the top models in an ENCODE-DREAM challenge. Additionally, we show that the Avocado model allows for efficient addition of new assays and biosamples to a pre-trained model, achieving high accuracy at predicting protein binding, even with only a single track of training data.\n\nAvailabilityTutorials and source code are available under an Apache 2.0 license at https://github.com/jmschrei/avocado.\n\nContactwilliam-noble@uw.edu or jmschr@cs.washington.edu",

    "abstract": "Background and aimsColorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States. Mortality is largely attributable to low patient compliance with screening and a subsequent high frequency of late-stage diagnoses. Noninvasive methods, such as stool- or blood-based diagnostics could improve patient compliance, however, existing techniques cannot adequately detect high-risk adenomas (HRAs) and early-stage CRC.\n\nMethodsHere we apply cancer profiling using amplicon sequencing of stool-derived eukaryotic RNA for 275 patients undergoing prospective CRC screening. A training set of 154 samples was used to build a random forest model that included 4 feature types (differentially expressed amplicons, total RNA expression, demographic information, and fecal immunochemical test results). An independent hold out test set of 121 patients was used to assess model performance.\n\nResultsWhen applied to the 121-patient hold out test set, the model attained a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94 for CRC and a ROC AUC of 0.87 for CRC and HRAs. In aggregate, the model achieved a 91 % sensitivity for CRC and a 73% sensitivity for HRAs at an 89% specificity for all other findings (medium-risk adenomas, low-risk adenomas, benign polyps, and no findings on a colonoscopy).\n\nConclusionCollectively, these results indicate that in addition to early CRC detection, stool-derived biomarkers can accurately and noninvasively identify HRAs, which could be harnessed to prevent CRC development for asymptomatic, average-risk patients.",

    "abstract": "The traditional focus on taxonomic diversity metrics for investigating species responses to habitat loss and fragmentation has limited our understanding on how biodiversity is impacted by habitat modification. This is particularly true for taxonomic groups such as bats which exhibit species-specific responses. Here, we investigate phylogenetic alpha and beta diversity of Neotropical bat assemblages across two environmental gradients, one in habitat quality and one in habitat amount. We surveyed bats in 39 sites located across a whole-ecosystem fragmentation experiment in the Brazilian Amazon, representing a gradient of habitat quality (interior-edge-matrix, hereafter IEM) in both continuous forest and forest fragments of different sizes (1, 10, and 100 ha; forest size gradient). For each habitat category, we quantified alpha and beta phylogenetic diversity, then used linear models and cluster analysis to explore how forest area and IEM gradient affect phylogenetic diversity. We found that the secondary forest matrix harboured significantly lower total evolutionary history compared to the fragment interiors, especially the 1 ha fragments, containing bat assemblages with more closely related species. Forest fragments [&ge;] 10 ha had levels of phylogenetic richness similar to continuous forest, suggesting that large fragments retain considerable levels of evolutionary history. The edge and matrix adjacent to large fragments tend to have closely related lineages nonetheless, suggesting phylogenetic homogenization in these IEM gradient categories. Thus, despite the high mobility of bats, fragmentation still induces considerable levels of erosion of phylogenetic diversity, suggesting that the various evolutionary history might not be able to persist in present-day human-modified landscapes.",

We identify evolutionary optimal life cycles as those which maximize the population growth rate. Among all interactions captured by two-player games, only eight life cycles were found to be evolutionarily optimal. Moreover, the vast majority of games promotes either of two classes of life cycles: (i) splitting into unicellular propagules or (ii) fragmentation into two offspring clusters of equal (or almost equal) size. Our findings indicate that the three most important characteristics, determining whether multicellular life cycles will evolve, are average performance of homogeneous groups, heterogeneous groups, and solitary cells.",

Through integration of geospatial approaches, statistical and network modelling, advances in computing and the management of immense datasets, as well as recent developments in machine learning that enable the automation of big data analyses, multiSEM and other cross-cutting imaging technologies have the potential to exert a profound impact on elucidation of disease mechanisms, translating to improvements in human health. Here we provide a protocol for acquisition and preparation of sample specimen sizes of diagnostic relevance for human anatomy and physiology. We discuss challenges and opportunities to integrate this approach with multibeam scanning electron microscopy work flows as well as multiple imaging modalities for mapping of organ and tissue structure and function.",

Here we establish a method for cell type classification utilizing images taken on a benchtop microscope directly from cell culture flasks eliminating the need for a dedicated imaging platform. Significant flask-to-flask heterogeneity was discovered and overcome to support network generalization to novel data. Cell density was found to be a prominent source of heterogeneity even within the single-cell regime indicating the presence of morphological effects due to diffusion-mediated cell-cell interaction. Expert classification was poor for single-cell images and excellent for multi-cell images suggesting experts rely on the identification of characteristic phenotypes within subsets of each population and not ubiquitous identifiers.

    "abstract": "The degree of Allele sharing of the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) genes has been linked with recurrent miscarriage (RM). However, no clear genetic markers of RM have yet been identified, possibly because of the complexity of interactions between paternal and maternal genes. We propose a methodology to analyse HLA haplotypes from couples either with histories of successful pregnancies or RM. This article describes, for the first time, a method of RM genetic-risk calculation. Novel HLA representation techniques allowed us to create an algorithm (IMMATCH) to retrospectively predict RM with an AUC = 0.71 (p = 0.0035) thanks to high-resolution typing and the use of linear algebra on peptide binding affinity data. The algorithm features an adjustable threshold to increase either sensitivity or specificity. Combining immunogenetics with artificial intelligence could create personalized tools to better understand the genetic causes of unexplained infertility and a gamete matching platform that could increase pregnancy success rates.",

Although the completely randomized experimental design has frequently been advocated to control for batch effects, it is rarely implemented in real applications due to time and budget constraints. Here, we mathematically prove that under two more flexible and realistic experimental designs--the \"reference panel\" and the \"chain-type\" designs--true biological variability can also be separated from batch effects. We develop Batch effects correction with Unknown Subtypes for scRNA-seq data (BUSseq), which is an interpretable Bayesian hierarchical model that closely follows the data-generating mechanism of scRNA-seq experiments. BUSseq can simultaneously correct batch effects, cluster cell types, impute missing data caused by dropout events, and detect differentially expressed genes without requiring a preliminary normalization step. We demonstrate that BUSseq outperforms existing methods with simulated and real data.",

    "abstract": "Dietary restriction (DR) consistently and universally extends health-and lifespan across taxa. Despite efforts to uncover the mechanisms underpinning DR - and ultimately translate its beneficial outcomes to humans - precise and universal mechanisms have not been identified. In biomedical science, the effects of DR are interpreted as regulating pro-longevity molecular pathways. This reasoning is guided by the conviction that DR evolved as an adaptive, pro-longevity physiological response to restricted food intake. Current evolutionary theory states that organisms should invest in their soma more heavily during periods of DR, and, when their resource availability improves, should outcompete age-matched rich-fed controls in survival and/or reproduction. Here we present a formal test of these key predictions utilising a large-scale demographic approach detailing mortality and fecundity in Drosophila melanogaster fed alternating dietary regimes (N > 66,000 flies across 11 genetic lines). Our experiments reveal surprising and substantial mortality costs when returning to a rich diet after periods of DR. These results suggest the effects of DR are not necessarily intrinsically pro-longevity and could be considered an escape from costs incurred under nutrient-rich conditions, in addition to novel, discrete costs associated with restricting dietary protein. These insights question the relevance of current evolutionary explanations of DR in interpreting the mechanistic basis of dietary restriction.",

Interpretation of introgressed sequences has focused on alleles derived in the Neanderthal lineage. Here, we demonstrate that Neanderthal introgression also reintroduced thousands of ancestral hominin alleles lost in the Eurasian out of Africa bottleneck. Combining evolutionary simulations, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) data, and in vitro validation, we show that reintroduced alleles (RAs) have different fitness effects than Neanderthal-derived alleles (NDAs) and that some RAs regulate gene expression independent of NDAs. Illustrating the broad potential influence of RAs, we find that over 70% of known phenotype associations with NDAs are equally associated with RAs. Finally, we discover enrichment for RA eQTL activity in several tissues, with strongest enrichment in the brain. In summary, our study reveals that Neanderthal introgression supplied Eurasians with many lost functional variants and demonstrates that RAs must be considered when evaluating the effects of introgression.\n\nONE SENTENCE SUMMARYNeanderthal interbreeding with modern humans restored to Eurasians, hundreds of thousands of ancient alleles that were lost in the out of Africa bottleneck.",

Among the different aspects of mate choice, the strategy an individual employ to search for potential mates (mate sampling) has been less explored despite its significance. Although analytical models of mate sampling have demonstrated significant differences in individual fitness returns for different sampling strategies, these models have rarely incorporated relevant information on the ecology of signalers and sensory physiology of receivers, both of which can profoundly influence which sampling strategy is optimal. In this study, we used simulation models to compare the costs and benefits of different female mate sampling strategies in an acoustically communicating field cricket (Plebeiogryllus guttiventris) by incorporating information on relative spacing of callers in natural choruses, their signal intensity and the effect of signal intensity on female phonotaxis behaviour. Mating with the louder caller that the female first approaches emerged as the optimal strategy, thus reflecting the importance of physiological mechanisms of sound signal localization (passive attraction) over active sampling. When tested empirically in the field, female behaviour was consistent with passive attraction.",

    "abstract": "Transcription of heterochromatic genes residing within the constitutive heterochromatin is paradoxical to the tenets of the epigenetic code. Drosophila melanogaster heterochromatic genes serve as an excellent model system to understand the mechanisms of their transcriptional regulation. Recent developments in chromatin conformation techniques have revealed that genome organization regulates the transcriptional outputs. Thus, using 5C-seq in S2 cells, we present a detailed characterization of the hierarchical genome organization of Drosophila pericentromeric heterochromatin and its contribution to heterochromatic gene expression. We show that pericentromeric TAD borders are enriched in nuclear Matrix attachment regions while the intra-TAD interactions are mediated by various insulator binding proteins. Heterochromatic genes of similar expression levels cluster into Het TADs which indicates their transcriptional co-regulation. To elucidate how heterochromatic factors, influence the expression of heterochromatic genes, we performed 5C-seq in the HP1a or Su(var)3-9 depleted cells. HP1a or Su(var)3-9 RNAi results in perturbation of global pericentromeric TAD organization but the expression of the heterochromatic genes is minimally affected. Subset of active heterochromatic genes have been shown to have combination of HP1a/H3K9me3 with H3K36me3 at their exons. Interestingly, the knock-down of dMES-4 (H3K36 methyltransferase), downregulates expression of the heterochromatic genes. This indicates that the local chromatin interactions and the combination of heterochromatic factors (HP1a or H3K9me3) along with the H3K36me3 is crucial to drive the expression of heterochromatic genes. Furthermore, dADD1, present near the TSS of the active heterochromatic genes, can bind to both H3K9me3 or HP1a and facilitate the heterochromatic gene expression by regulating the H3K36me3 levels. Therefore, our findings provide mechanistic insights into the interplay of genome organization and chromatin factors at the pericentromeric heterochromatin that regulates Drosophila melanogaster heterochromatic gene expression.",

    "abstract": "MotivationSequence alignment is a central operation in bioinformatics pipeline and, despite many improvements, remains a computationally challenging problem. Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is one method used to estimate the likelihood of two sequences to have a proper alignment. Using an LSH, it is possible to separate, with high probability and relatively low computation, the pairs of sequences that do not have an alignment from those that may have an alignment. Therefore, an LSH reduces in the overall computational requirement while not introducing many false negatives (i.e., omitting to report a valid alignment). However, current LSH methods treat sequences as a bag of k-mers and do not take into account the relative ordering of k-mers in sequences. And due to the lack of a practical LSH method for edit distance, in practice, LSH methods for Jaccard similarity or Hamming distance are used as a proxy.\n\nResultsWe present an LSH method, called Order Min Hash (OMH), for the edit distance. This method is a refinement of the minHash LSH used to approximate the Jaccard similarity, in that OMH is not only sensitive to the k-mer contents of the sequences but also to the relative order of the k-mers in the sequences. We present theoretical guarantees of the OMH as a gapped LSH.\n\nContactgmarcais@cs.cmu.edu, carlk@cs.cmu.edu",

    "abstract": "MotivationImputation of untyped SNPs has become important in Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS). There has also been a trend towards analyzing rare variants, driven by the decrease of genome sequencing costs. Rare variants are enriched in pedigrees that have many cases or extreme phenotypes. This is especially the case for large pedigrees, which makes family-based designs ideal to detect rare variants associated with complex traits. The costs of performing relatively large family-based GWAS can be significantly reduced by fully sequencing only a fraction of the pedigree and performing imputation on the remaining subjects. The program GIGI can efficiently perform imputation in large pedigrees but can be time consuming. Here, we implement GIGIs imputation approach in a new program, GIGI2, which performs imputation with computational time reduced by at least 25x on one thread and 120x on eight threads. The memory usage of GIGI2 is reduced by at least 30x. This reduction is achieved by implementing better memory layout and a better algorithm for solving the Identity by Descent graphs, as well as with additional features, including multithreading. We also make GIGI2 available as a webserver based on the same framework as the Michigan Imputation Server.\n\nAvailabilityGIGI2 is freely available online at https://cse-git.qcri.org/eullah/GIGI2 and the websever is at https://imputation.qcri.org/\n\nContactmsaad@hbku.edu.qa",

    "abstract": "The classification of clinical samples based on gene expression data is an important part of precision medicine. However, it has proved difficult to accurately predict survival outcomes and treatment responses for cancer patients. In this manuscript, we show how transforming gene expression data into a set of personalized (sample-specific) networks can allow us to harness existing graph-based methods to improve classifier performance. Existing approaches to personalized gene networks all have the limitation that they depend on other samples in the data and must get re-computed whenever a new sample is introduced. Here, we propose a novel method, called Personalized Annotation-based Networks (PAN), that avoids this limitation by using curated annotation databases to transform gene expression data into a graph. These databases organize genes into overlapping gene sets, called annotations, that we use to build a network where nodes represent functional terms and edges represent the similarity between them. Unlike competing methods, PANs are calculated for each sample independent of the population, making it a more efficient way to obtain single-sample networks. Using three breast cancer datasets as a case study (METABRIC and a super-set of GEO studies), we show that PAN classifiers not only predict cancer relapse better than gene features alone, but also outperform PPI and population-level graph-based classifiers. This work demonstrates the practical advantages of graph-based classification for high-dimensional genomic data, while offering a new approach to making sample-specific networks.\n\nSupplementary informationThe codes and data are available at https://github.com/thinng/PAN.\n\nContactThuc.Le@unisa.edu.au",

    "abstract": "CIC encodes a transcriptional repressor and MAPK signalling effector that is inactivated by loss-of-function mutations in several cancer types, consistent with a role as a tumour suppressor. Here, we used bioinformatic, genomic, and proteomic approaches to investigate CICs interaction networks. We observed both previously identified and novel candidate interactions between CIC and SWI/SNF complex members, and also observed novel interactions between CIC and cell cycle regulators and RNA processing factors. We found that CIC loss is associated with an increased frequency of mitotic defects in human cell lines and an in vivo mouse model and with dysregulated expression of mitotic regulators. We also observed aberrant splicing in CIC-deficient cell lines predominantly at 3 and 5 untranslated regions of genes, including genes involved in MAPK signalling, DNA repair, and cell cycle regulation. Our study thus characterises the complexity of CICs functional network and describes the effect of its loss on cell cycle regulation, mitotic integrity, and transcriptional splicing, thereby expanding our understanding of CICs potential roles in cancers. In addition, our work exemplifies how multi-omic, network-based analyses can be used to uncover novel insights into the interconnected functions of pleiotropic genes/proteins across cellular contexts.\n\nSimple summaryCapicua (CIC) is a gene that is frequently mutated in several cancer types, including stomach cancers and certain subtypes of brain tumours and sarcomas. CIC, the protein encoded by the CIC gene, has been shown to play a multitude of roles in both normal and cancer cell functions; however, most studies exploring these roles focus on a single aspect of CIC function and may therefore overlook complex interconnected activities in which CIC is involved. In this study, we have used multiple complementary approaches to obtain a broader view of CICs complex functional networks. We observed novel interactions (genetic or physical) between CIC and genes/proteins involved in various aspects of cellular function, including regulation of cell division and processing of RNA molecules. Altogether, our work characterises the complexity of CICs functional network and expands our understanding of its potential roles in cancer.",

    "abstract": "Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurological disorder that is caused by a CAG repeat expansion, translated into polyglutamine, in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Although the length of this repeat polymorphism is inversely correlated with age of onset (AOO), it does not fully explain the variability in AOO. Genomic studies have provided evidence for the involvement of DNA repair in modifying this trait, potentially through somatic repeat instability. We therefore assessed genetic variants within the 12bp interrupting sequence between the pathogenic CAG repeat and the polymorphic proline (CCG) tract in the HTT gene and identified variants that result in complete loss of interruption (LOI) between the adjacent CAG/CCG repeats. Analysis of multiple HD pedigrees showed that this variant is associated with dramatically earlier AOO and is particularly relevant to HD patients with reduced penetrance alleles. On average AOO of HD is hastened by an average of 25 years in LOI carriers. This finding indicates that the number of uninterrupted CAG repeats is the most significant contributor to AOO of HD and is more impactful than polyglutamine length, which is not altered in these patients. We show that the LOI variant is associated with increases in both somatic and germline repeat instability, demonstrating a potential mechanism for this effect. Screening individuals from the general population (n=2,674 alleles) suggests that the variant occurs only in expanded CAG repeat alleles. Identification of this modifier has important clinical implications for disease management of HD families, especially for those in the reduced penetrance ranges.",

    "abstract": "Fusobacterium are Gram-negative, anaerobic, opportunistic pathogens involved in multiple diseases, including the oral pathogen Fusobacterium nucleatum being linked to the progression and severity of colorectal cancer. The global identification of virulence factors in Fusobacterium has been greatly hindered by a lack of properly assembled and annotated genomes. Using newly completed genomes from nine strains and seven species of Fusobacterium, we report the identification and correction of virulence factors from the Type 5 secreted autotransporter and FadA protein families, with a focus on the genetically tractable strain F. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum ATCC 23726 and the classic typed strain F. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum ATCC 25586. Within the autotransporters, we employed protein sequence similarity networks to identify subsets of virulence factors, and show a clear differentiation between the prediction of outer membrane adhesins, serine proteases, and proteins with unknown function. These data have defined protein subsets within the Type 5a effectors that are present in predicted invasive strains but are broadly lacking in passively invading strains; a key phenotype associated with Fusobacterium virulence. However, our data shows that prior bioinformatic analysis that predicted species of Fusobacterium to be non-{inverted exclamation}nvasive can indeed invade human cells, and that pure phylogenetic analysis to determine the virulence within this bacterial genus should be used cautiously and subsequently paired with experiments to validate these hypotheses. In addition, we provide data that show a complex interplay between autotransporters, MORN2 domain containing proteins, and FadA adhesins that we hypothesize synergistically contribute to host cell interactions and invasion. In summary, we report that accurate open reading frame annotations using complete Fusobacterium genomes, in combination with experimental validation of invasion, redefines the repertoire of virulence factors that could be contributing to the species specific pathology of multiple Fusobacterium induced infections and diseases.\n\nIMPORTANCEFusobacterium are emerging pathogens that contribute to the progression and severity of multiple mammalian and human infectious diseases, including colorectal cancer. Despite a validated connection with disease, a limited number of proteins have been characterized that define a direct molecular mechanism for pathogenesis in a diverse range of host tissue infections. We report a comprehensive examination of virulence associated protein families in multiple Fusobacterium species, and show that complete genomes facilitate the correction and identification of multiple, large Type 5a secreted autotransporter genes in previously misannotated or fragmented genomes. In addition, we use protein sequence similarity networks and human cell invasion experiments to show that previously predicted non-invasive strains can indeed enter human cells, and that this is likely due to the expansion of specific virulence proteins that drive F. nucleatum infections and disease.",

    "abstract": "Cellular membranes play host to a wide variety of morphologically and chemically complex processes. Although model membranes, like liposomes, are already widely used to reconstitute and study these processes, better tools are needed for making model bilayers that faithfully mimic cellular membranes. Existing methods for fabricating cell-sized (m) or organelle-sized (tens to hundreds of nm) lipid vesicles have distinctly different requirements. Of particular note for biology, it remains challenging for any technique to efficiently encapsulate fragile cargo molecules or to generate liposomes with stable, asymmetric lipid-leaflets within the bilayer. Here we describe a tunable microfluidic device and protocol for fabricating liposomes with desired diameters ranging from ~10 m to ~100 nm. Lipid vesicle size is templated by the simple inclusion of a polycarbonate filter within the microfluidic system and tuned with flow rate. We show that the vesicles made with our device are stable, unilamellar, lipid asymmetric, and capable of supporting transmembrane protein assembly, peripheral membrane protein binding, as well as soluble cargo encapsulation (including designer nanocages for biotechnology applications). These fabricated vesicles provide a new platform for studying the biophysically rich processes found within lipid-lipid and lipid-protein systems typically associated with cellular membranes.",

    "abstract": "Naturally occurring functionally variable alleles in specific genes within a population allows the identification of which genes are involved in the determination of which phenotypes. The omnigenetic model proposes that essentially all genes which are expressed in relevant contexts likely play some role in determining phenotypic outcomes. Here, we develop an approach to identify genes where natural functional variation plays a role in shaping many phenotypic traits simultaneously. We demonstrate that this approach identifies a distinct set of genes relative to conventional genome wide association using data for 260 traits scored a maize diversity panel, and the genes identified using this approach are more likely to be independently validated than genes identified by convetional genome wide association. Genes identified by the new approach share a number of features with a gold standard set of genes characterized through forward genetics which separate them from both genes identified by conventional genome wide association and the overall population of annotated gene models. These features include evidence of significantly stronger purifying selection, positional conservation across the genomes of related species, greater length, and a scarcity of presence absence variation for these loci in natural populations. Genes identified by phenome-wide analyses also showed much stronger signals of GO enrichment and purification than genes identified by conventional genome wide association. Overall these findings are consistent with large subset of annotated gene models - despite support from transcriptional and homology evidence - being unlikely to play any role in determining organismal phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Both Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) are autoimmune diseases sharing similar genetic backgrounds. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have constantly disclosed numerous genetic variants conferring to both disease risks at 7q32.1, but the functional mechanisms underlying them are still largely unknown. Through combining fine-mapping and functional epigenomic analyses, we prioritized a potential independent functional SNP (rs13239597) within TNPO3 promoter region, residing in a putative enhancer element. Functional analysis integrating expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) and high-throughput chromatin interaction (Hi-C) demonstrated that IRF5 is the distal target gene (~118kb) of rs13239597, which is a key regulator of pathogenic autoantibody dysregulation increased risk of both SLE and SSc. We experimentally validated the long-range chromatin interactions between rs13239597 and IRF5 using chromosome conformation capture (3C) assay. We further demonstrated that rs13239597-A acted as an allele-specific enhancer regulating IRF5 expression, independently of TNPO3 by using dual-luciferase reporter assays and CRISPR-Cas9. Particularly, the transcription factor EVI1 could preferentially bind to rs13239597-A allele and increase the enhancer activity to regulate IRF5 expression. Taken together, our results uncovered the mechanistic insight connecting between a noncoding functional variant with a distal immunologically pathogenic gene IRF5, which might obligate in understanding the complex genetic architectures of SLE and SSc pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Perception of vocalizations and other behaviorally relevant sounds requires integrating acoustic information over hundreds of milliseconds, but the latency of sound-evoked activity in auditory cortex typically has much shorter latency. It has been observed that the acoustic context, i.e., sound history, can modulate sound evoked activity. Contextual effects are attributed to modulatory phenomena, such as stimulus-specific adaption and contrast gain control. However, an encoding model that links context to natural sound processing has yet to be established. We tested whether a model in which spectrally tuned inputs undergo adaptation mimicking short-term synaptic plasticity can account for contextual effects during natural sound processing. Single-unit activity was recorded from primary auditory cortex of awake ferrets during presentation of noise with natural temporal dynamics and fully natural sounds. Encoding properties were characterized by a standard linear-nonlinear spectro-temporal receptive field model (LN STRF) and STRF variants that incorporated STP-like adaptation. In two models, STP was applied either globally across all spectral channels or locally to subsets of channels. For most neurons, STRFs incorporating locally tuned STP predicted neural activity as well or better than the LN and global STP STRF. The strength of nonlinear adaptation varied across neurons. Within neurons, adaptation was generally stronger for activation with excitatory than inhibitory gain. Neurons showing improved STP model performance also tended to undergo stimulus-specific adaptation, suggesting a common mechanism for these phenomena. When STP STRFs were compared between passive and active behavior conditions, response gain often changed, but average STP parameters were stable. Thus, spectrally and temporally heterogeneous adaptation, subserved by a mechanism with STP-like dynamics, may support representation of the diverse spectro-temporal patterns that comprise natural sounds.\n\nAuthor summarySuccessfully discriminating between behaviorally relevant sounds such as vocalizations and environmental noise requires processing how acoustic information changes over many tens to hundreds of milliseconds. The sound-evoked activity measured for most auditory cortical neurons is relatively short (< 50 ms), so it is not clear how the auditory cortex encodes sound information over longer periods. In this study, we propose that nonlinear adaptation, mimicking the effects of short-term synaptic plasticity (STP), enables auditory neurons to encode longer and more complex spectro-temporal patterns. A model in which sound history is stored in the latent state of plastic synapses is able to describe responses of single cortical neurons to natural sounds better than a standard encoding model that does not include nonlinear adaptation. Moreover, STP-like adaptation can account for contextual effects on sound evoked activity that cannot be accounted for by standard encoding models.",

    "abstract": "When deprived of nutrients, trophozoites of the eye pathogen Acanthamoeba castellanii make a cyst wall, which contains cellulose and has two layers connected by cone-shaped ostioles. We recently showed chitin is also present and identified three sets of lectins, which localize to the ectocyst layer (Jonah lectin) or the endocyst layer and ostioles (Luke and Leo lectins). To determine how the cyst wall is made, we examined encysting protists using structured illumination microscopy, probes for glycopolymers, and tags for lectins. In the first stage (3 to 9 hr), cellulose, chitin, and a Jonah lectin were each made in dozens of encystation-specific vesicles. In the second stage (12 to 18 hr), a primordial wall contained both glycopolymers and Jonah lectin, while small, flat ostioles were outlined by a Luke lectin. In the third stage (24 to 36 hr), an ectocyst layer enriched in Jonah lectin was connected to an endocyst layer enriched in Luke and Leo lectins by large, conical ostioles. Jonah and Luke lectins localized to the same places in mature cyst walls (72 hr) independent of the timing of expression. The Jonah lectin and the glycopolymer bound by the lectin were accessible in the ectocyst layer of mature walls. In contrast, Luke and Leo lectins and glycopolymers bound by the lectins were mostly inaccessible in the endocyst layer and ostioles. These results show that cyst wall formation is a tightly choreographed event, in which glycopolymers and lectins combine to form a mature wall with a protected endocyst layer.\n\nImportanceWhile the cyst wall of Acanthamoeba castellanii, cause of eye infections, contains cellulose like plants and chitin like fungi, it is a temporary, protective structure, analogous to spore coats of bacteria. We showed here that, unlike plants and fungi, A. castellanii makes cellulose and chitin in encystation-specific vesicles. The outer and inner layers of cyst walls, which resemble the primary and secondary walls of plant cells, respectively, are connected by unique structures (ostioles) that synchronously develop from small, flat circles to large, conical structures. Cyst wall proteins, which are lectins that bind cellulose and chitin, localize to inner or outer layers independent of the timing of expression. Because of its abundance and accessibility in the outer layer, the Jonah lectin is an excellent target for diagnostic antibodies. A description of the sequence of events during cyst wall development is a starting point for mechanistic studies of its assembly.",

    "abstract": "The accurate quantification of eukaryotic species abundances from bulk samples remains a key challenge for community description and environmental biomonitoring. We resolve this challenge by combining shotgun sequencing, mapping to reference DNA barcodes or to mitogenomes, and three correction factors: (1) a percent-coverage threshold to filter out false positives, (2) an internal-standard DNA spike-in to correct for stochasticity during sequencing, and (3) technical replicates to correct for stochasticity across sequencing runs. This pipeline achieves a strikingly high accuracy of intraspecific abundance estimates from samples of known composition (mapping to barcodes R2=0.93, mitogenomes R2=0.95) and a high repeatability across environmental-sample replicates (barcodes R2=0.94, mitogenomes R2=0.93). As proof of concept, we sequence arthropod samples from the High Arctic systematically collected over 17 years, detecting changes in species richness, abundance, and phenology using either barcodes or mitogenomes.

    "abstract": "Stable recognition of the intron branchpoint by the U2 snRNP to form the pre-spliceosome is the first ATP-dependent step of splicing. Genetic and biochemical data from yeast indicate that Cus2 aids U2 snRNA folding into the stem IIa conformation prior to pre-spliceosome formation. Cus2 must then be removed by an ATP-dependent function of Prp5 before assembly can progress. However, the location from which Cus2 is displaced and the nature of its binding to the snRNP are unknown. Here, we show that Cus2 contains a conserved UHM (U2AF homology motif) that binds Hsh155, the yeast homolog of human SF3b1, through a conserved ULM (U2AF ligand motif). Mutations in either motif block binding and allow pre-spliceosome formation without ATP. A 2.0 [A] resolution structure of the Hsh155 ULM in complex with the UHM of Tat-SF1, the human homolog of Cus2, and complementary binding assays show that the interaction is highly similar between yeast and humans. Furthermore, Tat-SF1 enforces ATP-dependence of pre-spliceosome formation in yeast extracts, showing that it can replace Cus2 function. Cus2 is removed before pre-spliceosome formation, and both Cus2 and its Hsh155 ULM binding site are absent from available cryo-EM structure models. However, our data are consistent with the apparent location of the disordered Hsh155 ULM between the U2 stem-loop IIa and the HEAT-repeats of Hsh155 that interact with Prp5. We suggest a model in which Prp5 uses ATP to remove Cus2 from Hsh155 such that extended base pairing between U2 snRNA and the intron branchpoint can occur.",

To break this barrier, we use adaptive optics to noninvasively measure single-cell blood flow, in one of the most widely used research animals: the C57BL/6J mouse. Flow ranged four orders of magnitude (0.0002-1.55 {micro}L min-1) across the full spectrum of retinal vessel diameters (3.2-45.8 {micro}m), without requiring surgery or contrast dye.

    "abstract": "Root hairs are tubular protrusions of the root epidermis that significantly enlarge the exploitable soil volume in the rhizosphere. Trichoblasts, the cell type responsible for root hair formation, switch from cell elongation to tip growth through polarization of the growth machinery to a pre-defined root hair initiation domain (RHID) at the plasma membrane. The emergence of this polar domain resembles the establishment of cell polarity in other eukaryotic systems [1-3]. Rho-type GTPases of plants (ROPs) are among the first molecular determinants of the RHID [4, 5] and later play a central role in polar growth [6]. Numerous studies have elucidated mechanisms that position the RHID in the cell [7-9] or regulate ROP activity [10-18]. The molecular players that target ROPs to the RHID and initiate outgrowth, however, have not been identified. We dissected the timing of the growth machinery assembly in polarizing hair cells and found that positioning of molecular players and outgrowth are temporally separate processes that are each controlled by specific ROP guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEFs). A functional analysis of trichoblast-specific GEFs revealed GEF3 to be required for normal ROP polarization and thus efficient root hair emergence, while GEF4 predominantly regulates subsequent tip growth. Ectopic expression of GEF3 induced the formation of spatially confined, ROP-recruiting domains in other cell types, demonstrating the role of GEF3 to serve as a membrane landmark during cell polarization. Our findings suggest that morphogenetic programs in plants employ distinct regulatory modules for the alignment and activation of the cellular growth machinery.",

We imputed GmHapMap variants onto 21,618 previously genotyped (50K array/210K GBS) accessions with up to 96% success for common alleles. A GWAS performed with imputed data enabled us to identify a causal SNP residing in the NPC1 gene and to demonstrate its role in controlling seed oil content. We identified 405,101 haplotypes for the 55,589 genes and show that such haplotypes can help define alleles. Finally, we predicted 18,031 putative loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in 10,662 genes and illustrate how such a resource can be used to explore gene function. The GmHapMap provides a unique worldwide resource for soybean genomics and breeding.",

    "abstract": "Pharmacogenomics (PGx) studies how individual gene variations impact drug response phenotypes, which makes knowledge related to PGx a key component towards precision medicine. A significant part of the state-of-the-art knowledge in PGx is accumulated in scientific publications, where it is hardly usable to humans or software. Natural language processing techniques have been developed and are indeed employed for guiding experts curating this amount of knowledge. But, existing works are limited by the absence of high quality annotated corpora focusing on the domain. This absence restricts in particular the use of supervised machine learning approaches. This article introduces PGxCorpus, a manually annotated corpus, designed for the automatic extraction of PGx relationships from text. It comprises 945 sentences from 911 PubMed abstracts, annotated with PGx entities of interest (mainly genes variations, gene, drugs and phenotypes), and relationships between those. We present in this article the method used to annotate consistently texts, and a baseline experiment that illustrates how this resource may be leveraged to synthesize and summarize PGx knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Plasmids are mobile DNAs that adjust host cell functions for their own amplification and dissemination. We identified QfsR, a small RNA, transcribed from the Ti plasmid in the phytopathogen Agrobacterium fabrum. QfsR is widely conserved throughout RepABC plasmids carried by Rhizobiaceae. Target prediction, expression analysis and site-direct mutagenesis experiments show that QfsR directly pairs within polycistronic mRNAs transcribed from chromosomes (involved in flagella apparatus and succinoglycan biosynthesis) and Ti plasmid (involved in conjugative transfer). QfsR leads to a coordinated expression of whole polycistronic mRNA molecules. Whereas a lack of QfsR induces motility and reduces succinoglycan production, its overproduction increases the quorum sensing signal accumulation and the Ti plasmid conjugative transfer. Based on these observations, we propose QfsR as a hub connecting regulatory networks of motility, succinoglycan biosynthesis and plasmid conjugative transfer. To our knowledge, QfsR is the first example of a plasmid-encoded sRNA that controls chromosomal polycistronic mRNAs.\n\nSignificancePlasmids represent an important cost for the hosting cell although some are beneficial under certain circumstances. Agrobacterium tumefaciens harboring Tumor inducing plasmid (pTi) are able to infect plants and to use specific resources produced by the infected cells. We characterized QfsR, a novel small RNA (sRNA) from pTi, that directly regulates plasmid polycistronic mRNA but also chromosomal ones. QfsR contributes to a fine-tuned regulation of bacterial motility, exopolysaccharide biosynthesis and conjugative dissemination of pTi. Our results report the first plasmid-encoded sRNA able to modify and coordinate cellular behaviour probably for the benefit of the plasmid dissemination and tight crosstalk between plasmid and chromosome. This could be widespread since QfsR homologs were predicted in other plasmids of Rhizobiaceae symbionts and pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Despite partial experimental evidence, it is a long-standing and common belief that dreams serve an emotion regulation function. Revisiting this idea, recent neuroscientific theories have proposed that emotions experienced in dreams contribute to the resolution of emotional distress (e.g. fear extinction) and preparation for future waking affective reactions. Here we addressed one emerging common prediction from these theoretical accounts, namely that experiencing fear in dreams is associated with more adapted responses to threatening signals during wakefulness. Using a stepwise approach across two studies, we first identified brain regions activated when experiencing fear in dreams and then showed that frightening dreams modulated the response of these same regions to threatening stimuli during wakefulness. As predicted, more fear in dreams was associated with reduced activation of those fear-responsive regions during wakefulness. Specifically, in Study 1, we performed serial awakenings in 18 participants recorded throughout the night with high-density EEG and asked them whether they experienced any fear in their dreams. Insula activity increased (i.e. decreased delta and increased gamma power) for dreams containing fear. In Study 2, we tested 89 participants and found that those with higher incidence of fear in their dreams showed reduced fMRI response to fear-eliciting stimuli in the insula, amygdala and midcingulate cortex, while awake. Consistent with better emotion regulation processes, the same participants also displayed increased medial prefrontal cortex activity. These findings support that emotions in dreams and wakefulness engage similar neural substrates, and substantiate a link between emotional processes occurring during sleep and emotional brain functions during wakefulness.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOver one million Americans experience myocardial infarction (MI) every year, and the resulting scar and subsequent cardiac fibrosis contribute to heart failure and death. A specialized cell-cell adhesion protein, cadherin-11 (CDH11), contributes to inflammation and fibrosis in rheumatoid arthritis, pulmonary fibrosis, and aortic valve calcification but has not yet been studied in the context of cardiac remodeling after MI. We hypothesized that targeting CDH11 function after MI would reduce inflammation-driven fibrotic remodeling and infarct expansion to improve functional outcomes in mice.\n\nMethodsMI was induced by ligation of the left anterior descending artery in transgenic mice with reduced or ablated CDH11, wild type mice receiving bone marrow transplants from Cdh11 transgenic animals, and wild type mice treated with a functional blocking antibody against CDH11 (SYN0012). Cardiac function was measured by echocardiography, expression of cell populations was quantified by flow cytometry, and tissue remodeling by altered histological assessment and transcription of inflammatory and pro-angiogenic genes by qPCR. Co-culture was used to assess interactions between cardiac fibroblasts and macrophages.\n\nResultsMI increased transcription of Cdh11 in non-cardiomyocyte cells. Mice with deletion of Cdh11 and wild type mice receiving bone marrow transplants from Cdh11 transgenic animals had improved cardiac function and dimensions after MI. Animals given SYN0012 had improved cardiac function, reduced tissue remodeling, and altered transcription of inflammatory and proangiogenic genes. Targeting CDH11 also reduced the number of bone marrow-derived myeloid cells and increased pro-angiogenic cells in the heart three days after MI, consistent with a decrease in transcription and expression of IL-6 in the infarct region. Cardiac fibroblast and macrophage interactions led to an increase in IL-6 secretion that was reduced with SYN0012 treatment in vitro.\n\nConclusionsOur findings suggest that CDH11-expressing cells contribute to inflammation-driven fibrotic remodeling after MI, and that targeting CDH11 with a blocking antibody improves cardiac function after MI. This improvement is likely mediated by altered recruitment of bone marrow-derived cells, thereby limiting the macrophage-induced expression of IL-6 by fibroblasts and promoting vascularization.",
