    "abstract": "The uneven distributions of species over geography (e.g., tropical versus temperate regions) and phylogeny (e.g., rodents and bats versus the aardvark) are prominent biological patterns for which causal interconnections remain enigmatic. Here we investigate this central issue for living mammals using time-sliced clades sampled from a comprehensive recent phylogeny (N=5,911 species, [~]70% with DNA) to assess how different levels of unsampled extinction impact the inferred causes of species richness variation. Speciation rates are found to strongly exceed crown age as a predictor of clade species richness at every time slice, rejecting a clock-like model in which the oldest clades are the most speciose. Instead, mammals that are low-vagility or daytime-active show the fastest recent speciation and greatest extant richness. This suggests primary roles for dispersal limitation leading to geographic speciation (peripatric isolation) and diurnal adaptations leading to ecological speciation (time partitioning). Rates of speciation are also faster in temperate than tropical lineages, but only among older clades, consistent with the idea that many temperate lineages are ephemeral. These insights, enabled by our analytical framework, offer straightforward support for ecological effects on speciation-rate variation among clades as the primary cause of uneven phylogenetic richness patterns.",

    "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is commonly used to investigate the neural bases of behavior ranging from basic cognitive mechanisms to aging to psychological disorders. However, the BOLD signal captured by fMRI is an indirect measure of neural function and is affected by many factors that are non-neural in origin. These non-neural factors, however, do affect brain vasculature such as the shape and timing of the hemodynamic response function (HRF) during task-evoked fMRI that, in turn, can cause inappropriate and/or misleading interpretations of fMRI differences between groups. In this study, we tested the proposition that vascular health risks, which often go unmeasured in neuroimaging studies, and aging interact to modify the shape and/or timing of the HRF (height, time-to-peak, width), which then affect the differences in patterns of brain activity in a task-evoked memory encoding paradigm. Adult participants (aged 20-74) answered questions about their health history and underwent two fMRI tasks: viewing of a flashing checkerboard using a slow event-related design and a paired associates memory encoding task during a fast event-related design. We found that aging and vascular risk had the largest impacts on the maximum peak value of the HRF. Using a subject-specific HRF resulted in an overall dampening of the estimated brain activity in both task-positive and task-negative regions due to a reduction in the inter-individual variance of that activity. Across three vascular risk factors, using a subject-specific HRF resulted in more consistent brain regions that reached significance and larger effect sizes compared with the canonical HRF. A slight advantage in the reliability of brain-behavior correlations also was found. The findings from this study have far reaching consequences for the interpretation of task-evoked fMRI activity, especially in populations known to experience alterations to brain vasculature including adults of all ages that have higher vascular risk, the majority of older adults, and people with neurocognitive disorders in which vasculature differences may play a role including dementia.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIOlder age was associated with smaller maximum peak of the hemodynamic response.\\nC_LIO_LIYounger and middle-aged adults with more vascular risk had higher HRF peaks.\\nC_LIO_LIUsing a subject-specific HRF resulted in a \\\"dampening\\\" of brain activity.\\nC_LIO_LIA subject-specific HRF resulted in more consistent aging and vascular risk effects.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Two-photon laser scanning microscopy, originally developed since 1990s1, has been widely applied for biomedical research in recent decades, particularly popular among neuroscientists for studying neural functions in vivo2. However, it is typically restricted to one imaging area that is orthogonal to the optical axis. Here, we demonstrate a novel multi-axis optical conjugation method that enables two-photon imaging at single-cell resolution simultaneously in multiple areas at different depths, each of which could have a view diameter of ~200 m and could be largely freely targeted within a zone up to 12-mm diameter. For example, we show simultaneous imaging of neuronal activities in the primary visual cortex (V1), the primary motor cortex (M1) and the hippocampal CA1 region of awake mice. This method can be readily implemented on a single conventional two-photon microscope to enable multi-area exploration of neuronal activities in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Humans can easily grasp the affective meaning of touch when observing social interactions. Several neural systems support this ability, including theory of mind (ToM) and somatosensory resonance systems, but it is unclear how these systems are affected in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Individuals with ASD are characterized by impairments in social interaction and the use of (non)verbal communication such as social and reciprocal touch. The present study applies an ecologically valid stimulus set and multivoxel pattern fMRI neuroimaging to pinpoint atypicalities in the neural circuitry underlying socio-affective touch observation in adults with ASD as compared to matched neurotypical controls. The MVPA results reveal that the affective meaning of touch is well represented in the temporoparietal junction, a core ToM mentalizing area, in both groups. Conversely, only the neurotypical group hosts affective touch representations in the somatosensory cortex, not the ASD group, yielding a significant group difference. Lastly, individuals with a more positive attitude towards receiving, witnessing, and providing social touch and with a higher score on social responsivity, show more differentiated representations of the affective meaning of touch in these somatosensory areas. Together, our findings imply that individuals with ASD are able to cognitively represent the affective meaning of touch, but they lack the spontaneous embodied somatosensory resonance when observing social touch communications. Individual differences in this diminished resonance appear to be related to social touch avoidance and quantitative autism traits.\\n\\nSignificance StatementAutism is characterized by socio-communicative impairments, including abnormal processing of interpersonal touch. Little is known about the neural basis of atypicalities in social touch processing in autism. Here, adults with and without autism watched video clips displaying social touch interactions and judged the affective valence of the touch. Subsequently, they underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while watching the same videos. Brain activity patterns demonstrate that adults with autism show intact cognitive understanding (i.e. \\\"knowing\\\") of observed socio-affective touch experiences but lack of embodied emotional resonance (i.e. \\\"feeling\\\"). This lack of emotional resonance is linked to social touch avoidance and quantitative autism traits. These findings highlight that the depth of experiencing the state of others is shallower in people with autism.",

    "abstract": "To date, a number of epigenetic clocks have been developed using DNA methylation data, aimed at approximating biological aging in multiple tissues/cells. However, despite the assumption that these clocks are meant to capture the same phenomenon-aging, their correlations with each other are weak, and there is a lack of consistency in their associations with outcomes of aging. Therefore, the goal of this study was to compare and contrast the molecular characteristics and functional associations of 11 existing epigenetic clocks, using data from diverse human tissue and cell types. Results suggest that the CpGs comprised in the various clocks differ in regards to the consistency of their age correlations across tissues/cells. Using microarray expression data from purified CD14+ monocytes, we found that six clocks--Yang, Hannum, Lin, Levine, Horvath1, and Horvath2--has relatively similar transcriptional profiles. Network analysis revealed nine co-expression modules, most of which display robust correlations across various clocks. One significant module--turquoise is involved in mitochondrial translation, gene expression, respiratory chain complex assembly, and oxidative phosphorylation. Finally, using data from 143B cells with chronically depleted mtDNA (rho0) and 143B controls, we found that rho0 cells have more than a three-standard deviation increase in epigenetic age for Levine (p=0.006), Lin (p=0.012), and Yang (p=0.013). In summary, these results demonstrate the shared and contrasting features of existing epigenetic clocks, in regards to the CpG characteristic, tissue specificity, and co-regulatory gene network signatures, and suggesting a link between two hallmarks of aging--epigenetic alterations and mitochondrial dysfunction.",

We analyzed the effects of curative-intent lung cancer treatment on functional exercise capacity (EC) and patient-reported outcomes (PROs).\\n\\nMethodsWe performed a prospective-observational cohort study of consecutive patients with stage I-IIIA lung cancer undergoing curative-intent therapy and assessed functional EC [primary outcome, six-minute walk distance (6MWD)], cancer-specific quality of life (QoL) [secondary outcome, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30) summary score], and exploratory outcomes including dyspnea [University of California San Diego Shortness of Breath Questionnaire (UCSD-SOBQ)] and fatigue [Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI)] symptoms before and at 1 to 3 months post-treatment.

However, the contribution of medicaments other than narcotics to mortality in different racial/age groups is less studied.\\n\\nMethodsWe regressed annual rates of mortality involving poisoning by medicaments but not narcotics/psychodysleptics (ICD-10 codes T36-39.xx or T41-50.8 but not T40.xx present as either underlying or contributing causes of death), as well as annual rates of mortality for certain subcategories of the above, including mortality involving poisoning by psychotropic drugs but not narcotics/psychodysleptics (ICD-10 codes T43.xx but not T40.xx present as either underlying or contributing causes of death) in different age/racial groups for both the 2000-2011 period and the 2011-2017 period against calendar year.\\n\\nResultsAnnual numbers of deaths involving poisoning by medicaments but not narcotics/psychodysleptics grew from 4,332 between 2000-2001 to 11,401 between 2016-2017, with the growth in the rates of those deaths being higher for the 2011-2017 period compared to the 2000-2011 period. The largest increases in the rates of mortality involving poisoning by medicaments but not narcotics/psychodysleptics were in non-elderly Non-Hispanic Native Americans, followed by Non-Hispanic whites. Most of those increases came from increases in the rates of mortality involving poisoning by psychotropic medications; the latter rates grew for the period of 2015-2017 vs. 2000-2002 by factors ranging from 2.75 for ages 35-44y to 5.37 for ages 55-64y.\\n\\nConclusionsThere were major increases in mortality involving poisoning by non-narcotic, particularly psychotropic medicaments, especially in non-elderly non-Hispanic whites and Native Americans. Our results, and the epidemiological data on mortality involving poisoning by different drugs and medications in the US, which are quite different from the ones in many other countries support the need for a comprehensive evaluation of the effect of various drugs, including psychotropic medications on health-related outcomes, the associated mortality the does not involve poisoning being listed on a death certificate, and the impact of medication misuse.",

    "abstract": "Harmonisation of data for pooled analysis relies on the principle of inferential equivalence between variables from different sources. Ideally, this is achieved using models of the direct relationship with gold standard criterion measures, but the necessary validation data are often unavailable. This study examines an alternative method of harmonisation by indirect validation. Starting methods were self-report or accelerometry, from which we derived indirect models of relationships with doubly labelled water (DLW)-measured physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) using sets of two bridge equations via one of three intermediate measures. Coefficients and performance of indirect models were compared to corresponding direct validation models (linear regression of DLW-measured PAEE on starting methods). Indirect model beta coefficients were attenuated compared to direct model betas (10-63%), narrowing the range of PAEE values; attenuation was greater when bridge equations were weak. Directly and indirectly harmonised models had similar error variance but most indirectly derived values were biased at group-level. Correlations with DLW-measured PAEE were identical after harmonisation using continuous linear but not categorical models. Wrist acceleration harmonised to DLW-measured PAEE via combined accelerometry and heart rate sensing had lowest error variance (24.5%) and non-significant mean bias 0.9 (95%CI: -1.6; 3.4) kJ*day-1*kg-1. Associations between PAEE and BMI were similar for directly and indirectly harmonised values, but most fell outside the confidence interval of the criterion PAEE-to-BMI association. Indirect models can be used for harmonisation. Performance depends on the measurement properties of original data, variance explained by available bridge equations, and similarity of population characteristics.",

Retrospective studies of natural zoonoses and passaging in the lab have identified a modest number of host-adaptive mutations. However, it is unclear if these mutations represent all ways that influenza can adapt to a new host. Here we take a prospective approach to this question by completely mapping amino-acid mutations to the avian influenza virus polymerase protein PB2 that enhance growth in human cells. We identify numerous previously uncharacterized human-adaptive mutations. These mutations cluster on PB2s surface, highlighting potential interfaces with host factors. Some previously uncharacterized adaptive mutations occur in avian-to-human transmission of H7N9 influenza, showing their importance for natural virus evolution. But other adaptive mutations do not occur in nature because they are inaccessible via single-nucleotide mutations. Overall, our work shows how selection at key molecular surfaces combines with evolutionary accessibility to shape viral host adaptation.",

It also remains unclear which specific domains of parenting are important for which specific offspring developmental outcomes. The study describes different domains of early parenting behaviours, their genetic heritability, and then determines the extent to which specific domains of parenting are associated with later offspring outcomes.\\n\\nMethodsParenting behaviours (birth to 3 years) were extracted from self-reported questionnaires administered to 12,358 mothers from the UK-based birth cohort study, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, and modelled as a latent factor using Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Genetic heritability and correlations between parenting factors were estimated using wide complex trait analysis. Offspring emotional, behavioural and academic outcomes were assessed at age 16 years using the self-reported Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire, the Development and Well-Being Assessment, and grades achieved in national English Language examination.\\n\\nResultsThree parenting factors were derived: parental enjoyment, conflictual relationships and stimulation; all showed low genetic heritability. There was no evidence of associations between parenting factors and offspring depressed mood. Stimulation was associated with better English grades after controlling for maternal education (standardised {beta}=0.058, p=0.007), and enjoyment was negatively associated with English grades ({beta}=-0.082, p=0.002). Conflictual relationships were associated with higher risk of offspring behavioural disorders after controlling for behavioural problems at age 3 years ({beta}=0.227, p=0.007). Higher enjoyment reduced the association between conflict and behavioural problems (interaction term {beta}=0.113, p<0.001).\\n\\nConclusionsWe found evidence for predictive specificity of early parenting domains for offspring outcomes in adolescence. Early stimulation, unlike enjoyment, promoted later educational achievement. Conflictual relationships were associated with greater risk of behavioural problems, buffered by increased enjoyment. These findings hold implications for parenting interventions, guiding their focus according to specificity of parenting domains and their long-term outcomes in children.",

The relative contributions of these effects depend on coverage, chemical dose, mechanism of action, and housing density.

We compared discharge medication prescriptions between patients with and without chronic kidney disease (CKD), coronary heart disease (CHD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diabetes.\\n\\nResultsThe mean age was 74.8 years, 53.3% were black and 73.7% were female. Hypertension (97.2%), diabetes (65.1%), COPD (51.3%), CKD (41.1%) and history of CHD (60.9%) were common. On admission and discharge, respectively, beta-blockers (66.4%, 72.7%), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (42.8%, 51.7%), diuretics (61.2%, 80.9%), loop diuretics (55.9%, 78.3%), calcium channel blockers (41.0%, 41.2%) and statins (44.7%, 50.3%) were commonly used. Spironolactone, digoxin, hydralazine plus isosorbide dinitrate (HISDN), isosorbide dinitrate alone and aldosterone receptor antagonists were used by <20%. For each medication, prescriptions were more common at discharge than admission. Many participants did not have Medicare claims for filled prescriptions in the year following discharge. A higher percentage of patients with versus without CKD, CHD, and diabetes had discharge prescriptions statins. Participants with CKD were also more likely to receive prescriptions for HISDN.\\n\\nConclusionBeta-blockers and diuretics were commonly prescribed at admission and discharge among HFpEF, but pharmacy claims for these medications within one-year were substantially less common. The comorbidities CHD, CKD, and diabetes were associated with prescriptions of statins at discharge.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesMathematical models have unanimously predicted that a first-generation HIV vaccine would be useful and cost-effective to roll out, but that its overall impact would be insufficient to reverse the epidemic. Here, we explore what factors contribute most to limiting the impact of such a vaccine.\\n\\nMethodsRanging from a theoretical ideal to a more realistic regimen, mirroring the one used in the currently ongoing trial in South Africa (HVTN 702), we model a nested hierarchy of vaccine attributes such as speed of roll-out, efficacy, and retention of booster doses.\\n\\nResultsThe predominant reasons leading to a substantial loss of vaccine impact on the HIV epidemic are the time required to scale up mass vaccination, limited durability and waning of efficacy.\\n\\nConclusionsA partially effective HIV vaccine will be a critical milestone for the development of a highly effective, durable, and scalable next-generation vaccine. Accelerated development, expedited vaccine availability, and improved immunogenicity are the main attributes of a vaccine that could dramatically reverse the course of the epidemic in highly endemic countries.",

    "abstract": "Kidneys are composed of numerous ciliated epithelial tubules called nephrons. Each nephron functions to reabsorb nutrients and concentrate waste products into urine. Defects in primary cilia are associated with abnormal formation of nephrons and cyst formation in a wide range of kidney disorders. Previous work in Xenopus laevis and zebrafish embryos established that loss of components that make up the Wnt/PCP pathway, Daam1 and ArhGEF19 (wGEF) perturb kidney tubulogenesis. Dishevelled, which activates both the canonical and non-canonical Wnt/PCP pathway, affect cilia formation in multiciliated cells. In this study, we investigated the role of the noncanoncial Wnt/PCP components Daam1 and ArhGEF19 (wGEF) in renal ciliogenesis utilizing polarized mammalian kidney epithelia cells (MDCKII and IMCD3) and Xenopus laevis embryonic kidney. We demonstrate that knockdown of Daam1 and ArhGEF19 in MDCKII and IMCD3 cells leads to loss of cilia, and Daam1s effect on ciliogenesis is mediated by the formin-activity of Daam1. Moreover, Daam1 co-localizes with the ciliary transport protein IFT88. Interestingly, knocking down Daam1 in Xenopus kidney does not lead to loss of cilia. This data suggests a new role for Daam1 in the formation of primary cilia.",

    "abstract": "Genome annotation is the process of identifying the location and function of a genomes encoded features. Improving the biological accuracy of annotation is a complex and iterative process requiring researchers to review and incorporate multiple sources of information such as transcriptome alignments, predictive models based on sequence profiles, and comparisons to features found in related organisms. Because rapidly decreasing costs are enabling an ever-growing number of scientists to incorporate sequencing as a routine laboratory technique, there is widespread demand for tools that can assist in the deliberative analytical review of genomic information. To this end, Apollo is an open source software package that enables researchers to efficiently inspect and refine the precise structure and role of genomic features in a graphical browser-based platform.\\n\\nIn this paper we first outline some of Apollos newer user interface features, which were driven by the needs of this expanding genomics community. These include support for real-time collaboration, allowing distributed users to simultaneously edit the same encoded features while also instantly seeing the updates made by other researchers on the same region in a manner similar to Google Docs. Its technical architecture enables Apollo to be integrated into multiple existing genomic analysis pipelines and heterogeneous laboratory workflow platforms. Finally, we consider the implications that Apollo and related applications may have on how the results of genome research are published and made accessible.
