    "abstract": "The use of single-cell transcriptomics has become a major approach to delineate cell subpopulations and the transitions between them. While various computational tools using different mathematical methods have been developed to infer clusters, marker genes, and cell lineage, none yet integrate these within a mathematical framework to perform multiple tasks coherently. Such coherence is critical for the inference of cell-cell communication, a major remaining challenge. Here we present similarity matrix-based optimization for single-cell data analysis (SoptSC), in which unsupervised clustering, pseudotemporal ordering, lineage inference, and marker gene identification are inferred via a structured cell-to-cell similarity matrix. SoptSC then predicts cell-cell communication networks, enabling reconstruction of complex cell lineages that include feedback or feedforward interactions. Application of SoptSC to early embryonic development, epidermal regeneration, and hematopoiesis demonstrates robust identification of subpopulations, lineage relationships, and pseudotime, and prediction of pathway-specific cell communication patterns regulating processes of development and differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular RNA has been proposed to mediate communication between cells and organisms however relatively little is understood regarding how specific sequences are selected for export. Here we describe a specific Argonaute protein (exWAGO) that is secreted in extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by the gastrointestinal nematode Heligmosomoides bakeri, at multiple copies per EV. Phylogenetic and gene expression analyses demonstrate exWAGO orthologues are highly conserved and abundantly expressed in related parasites but highly diverged in free-living genus Caenorhabditis. We show that the most abundant small RNAs released from the nematode parasite are not microRNAs as previously thought, but rather secondary small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that are produced by RNA-dependent RNA Polymerases. The siRNAs that are released in EVs have distinct evolutionary properties compared to those resident in free-living or parasitic nematodes. Immunoprecipitation of exWAGO demonstrates that it specifically associates with siRNAs from transposons and newly evolved repetitive elements that are packaged in EVs and released into the host environment. Together this work demonstrates molecular and evolutionary selectivity in the small RNA sequences that are released in EVs into the host environment and identifies a novel Argonaute protein as the mediator of this.",

    "abstract": "Perceptual decisions are not only determined by current sensory information but are also influenced by recent experience. Can the magnitude of expectation-based decision biases be flexibly modulated based on the outcome of previous decisions? We trained rats in several two-alternative forced choice auditory tasks, where the probability to repeat the previous stimulus category was varied in blocks of trials. All rats capitalized on the serial correlations of the stimulus sequence by consistently exploiting a transition bias: a tendency to repeat or alternate their previous response using an internal trial-by-trial estimate of the sequence repeating probability. Surprisingly, this expectation bias was null in trials immediately following an error. The internal estimate however was not reset and it became effective again causing a bias after the next correct response. This ability to rapidly activate and inactivate the bias was captured by a non-linear generative model of rat behavior, whereby a reward-driven modulatory signal gated the use of the latent estimate of the environment statistics on the current decision. These results demonstrate that rats use behavioral outcomes to flexibly modulate how expectations derived from the recent history influence their decisions.",

    "abstract": "The PacBio sequencing is a powerful approach to study the DNA or RNA sequences in a longer scope. It is especially useful in exploring the complex structural variants generated by random integration or multiple rearrangement of internal or external sequences. However, there is still no tool designed to uncover their structural organization in the host genome. Here, we present a tool, TSD, for complex structural variant discovery using PacBio targeted sequencing data. It allows researchers to identify and visualize the genomic structures of targeted sequences by unlimited splitting, alignment and assembly of long PacBio reads. Application to the sequencing data derived from an HBV integrated human cell line(PLC/PRF/5) indicated that TSD could recover the full profile of HBV integration events, especially for the regions with the complex human-HBV genome integrations and multiple HBV rearrangements. Compared to other long read analysis tools, TSD showed a better performance for detecting complex genomic structural variants. TSD is publicly available at: https://github.com/menggf/tsd",

    "abstract": "Sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) is a transmembrane pump that plays an important role in transporting calcium into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). While calcium (Ca2+) binds SERCA with micro-molar affinity, magnesium (Mg2+) and potassium (K+) also compete with calcium (Ca2+) binding. However, the molecular bases for these competing ions influence on SERCA function and the selectivity of the pump for Ca2+ are not well-established. We therefore used in silico methods to resolve molecular determinants of cation binding in the canonical site I and II Ca2+ binding sites: 1) triplicate molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Mg2+, Ca2+and K+-bound SERCA. 2) mean spherical approximation (MSA) theory to determine the affinity and selectivity of cation binding to the MD-resolved structures and 3) state models of SERCA turnover informed from MSA-derived affinity data. Our key findings are that a) coordination at sites I and II are optimized for Ca2+and to a lesser extent for Mg2+ and K+, as determined by MD-derived cation-amino acid oxygen and bound water configurations, b) the impaired coordination and high desolvation cost for Mg2+ precludes favorable Mg2+ binding relative to Ca2+, while K+ has limited capacity to bind site I, c) Mg2+ most likely acts as inhibitor and K+ as intermediate in SERCAs reaction cycle, based on a best-fit state model of SERCA turnover. These findings provide a quantitative basis for SERCA function that leverages molecular-scale thermodynamic data and rationalize enzyme activity across broad ranges of K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations.",

We integrated behavioral data from more than 17,000 dogs from 101 breeds with breed-averaged genotypic data (N = 5,697 dogs) from over 100,000 loci in the dog genome. Across 14 traits, we found that breed differences in behavior are highly heritable, and that clustering of breeds based on behavior accurately recapitulates genetic relationships. We identify 131 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with breed differences in behavior, which are found in genes that are highly expressed in the brain and enriched for neurobiological functions and developmental processes. Our results provide insight into the heritability and genetic architecture of complex behavioral traits, and suggest that dogs provide a powerful model for these questions.",

Here, we present a robust method that enables rapid, large-scale acquisition of data from tissue specimens, combined with an approach for automated data segmentation using machine learning, which dramatically increases the speed of image analysis. We demonstrate the feasibility of these methods through the 3D analysis of human muscle tissue by showing that our process results in an improvement in speed of up to three orders of magnitude as compared to manual approaches for data segmentation.

HSPCs will then colonize haematopoietic organs allowing haematopoiesis throughout adult life. The mechanism underlying EHT including the role of each aortic endothelial cell within the global aorta dynamics remains unknown. In the present study, we show for the first time that EHT involves the remodelling of individual cells within a collective migration of endothelial cells which is tightly orchestrated, resulting in HSPCs extrusion in the sub-aortic space without compromising aorta integrity. By performing a cross-disciplinary study which combines high resolution 4D imaging and theoretical analysis based on the concepts of classical mechanics, we propose that this complex developmental process is dependent on mechanical instabilities of the aorta preparing and facilitating the extrusion of HSPCs.",

    "abstract": "Mycoplasmas are the smallest free-living organisms and cause a number of economically important diseases affecting humans, animals, insects and plants. Here, we demonstrate that highly virulent Mycoplasma mycoides subspecies capri (Mmc) can be fully attenuated via targeted deletion of non-essential genes encoding, among others, potential virulence traits. Five genomic regions, representing approximately ten percent of the original Mmc genome, were successively deleted using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as an engineering platform. Specifically, a total of 68 genes out of the 432 genes verified to be individually nonessential in the JCVI-Syn3.0 minimal cell, were excised from the genome. In vitro characterization showed that this mutant was similar to its parental strain in terms of its doubling time, even though ten percent of the genome content were removed. A novel in vivo challenge model in goats revealed that the wild-type parental strain caused marked necrotizing inflammation at the site of inoculation, septicemia and all animals reaching endpoint criteria within seven days after experimental infection. This is in contrast to the mutant strain, which caused no clinical signs nor pathomorphological lesions. These results highlight, for the first time, the rational design, construction and complete attenuation of a Mycoplasma strain via synthetic genomics tools. Trait addition using the yeast-based genome engineering platform and subsequent in vitro or in vivo trials employing the Mycoplasma chassis will allow us to dissect the role of individual candidate Mycoplasma virulence factors and lead the way for the development of an attenuated designer vaccine.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEMembers of the Mycoplasma mycoides cluster cause important animal plaques in Africa and Asia, which impact animal welfare, provision of food and the life of thousands of small-scale farmers. We applied synthetic biology tools to Mycoplasma mycoides in order to design and create a fully attenuated Mycoplasma strain that was subsequently confirmed in vivo using a novel caprine infection model. This is the first time that a Mycoplasma mutant developed by applying synthetic biology tools has been tested in vivo to pin point candidate virulence traits. The mutant strain is similar to \\\"apathogenic E. coli K12\\\" strains that boosted the research on host-pathogen interactions for the genus Escherichia and other bacterial genera.",

We implemented whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in a national healthcare system to streamline diagnosis and to discover unknown aetiological variants, in the coding and non-coding regions of the genome. In a pilot study for the 100,000 Genomes Project, we generated WGS data for 13,037 participants, of whom 9,802 had a rare disease, and provided a genetic diagnosis to 1,138 of the 7,065 patients with detailed phenotypic data. We identified 95 Mendelian associations between genes and rare diseases, of which 11 have been discovered since 2015 and at least 79 are confirmed aetiological. Using WGS of UK Biobank1, we showed that rare alleles can explain the presence of some individuals in the tails of a quantitative red blood cell (RBC) trait. Finally, we reported 4 novel non-coding variants which cause disease through the disruption of transcription of ARPC1B, GATA1, LRBA and MPL. Our study demonstrates a synergy by using WGS for diagnosis and aetiological discovery in routine healthcare.",

More importantly, GSK-3{beta} and TANK have been shown to play crucial roles in different diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders. The GSK-3{beta}-inhibitor  CHIR and the TANK-inhibitor  XAV are two pyrimidine molecules, holding high potential as possible therapeutic drugs. However, their effect on neural tissue is poorly understood. In this study, we tested the effects of CHIR and XAV on human neural precursor cells (hNPCs) derived from human embryonic stem cells. We found that CHIR-mediated inhibition of GSK-3{beta} promotes neural differentiation. In contrast, XAV-mediated inhibition of TANK leads to de-differentiation. These results highlight the relative importance of these two enzymes in determining the neurodevelopmental status of hNPCs.
