    "abstract": "The Bithynia snails of B. funiculata, B. siamensis siamensis and B. siamensis goniomphalos, are first intermediate hosts of Opisthorchis viverrini. The success of parasitic infection in snails is related to the host species and efficiency of their internal defense system. Parasitic infections in snails exhibited significant variations in the number of hemocytes in hemolymph. This study investigated hemocyte counts in Bithynia snails for various durations of O. viverrini infection. The three species/subspecies snails were infected with O. viverrini and hemocytes were counted at post-exposed periods of 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96 h, and 1, 4 and 8 wk to evaluate the hemocyte response to the infection. Three major hemocyte morphotypes, namely, agranulocytes, semigranulocytes and granulocytes, were observed. After infection, the differential hemocyte morphotype counts in all species/subspecies significantly increased in granulocytes at 2 h (p < 0.05) and decreased in semigranulocytes and agranulocytes at 2 to 4 h (p < 0.05). The total hemocyte counts were significant increased at 2 h after exposure in B. s. siamensis and B. funiculata (p < 0.05). Additionally, the number of hemocytes was reduced after exposure at 4, 6 and 12 h in B. s. goniomphalos and at 12, 24 and 48 h in B. funiculata (p < 0.05). From 96 h to 8 wk, the number of hemocytes was reestablished in the hemolymph, indicating that defensive cells in the host species have different mechanisms for their susceptibility or resistance to parasitic infections. Further studies on molecular functions will be done.",

    "abstract": "Spatial navigation is the most frequently used behavioral paradigm to study hippocampal dependent memory formation in rodents. However, commonly used tasks can present some limitations: i) they are labor intensive, preventing the implementation of parallel testing for high-throughput experimentation; ii) yield a low number of repeated trials, curtailing the statistical power; iii) are hard to combine with neural recordings, because tethering sometimes interferes with behavior; iv) are not based on overt behavioral responses that can be precisely timed, making difficult the identification of the underlying neural events; v) produce a low spatial coverage, limiting the characterization of neuronal patterns related to spatial information. To circumvent these limitations, we developed a spatial memory task that required minimal human intervention, allowed simultaneous and unsupervised testing of several mice, and yielded a high number of recall trials per session (up to ~20). Moreover, because recall sessions could be repeated over many days, the task provided enough statistical power to characterize in detail the animals behavior during memory recall, even to quantify the decay in spatial accuracy of memories as they are stacked across days. In addition, the task is compatible with neural activity recordings. Together, these features make our task a valuable tool to start dissecting the neural circuit dynamics underlying spatial memory recall.",

    "abstract": "Essential tremor manifests predominantly as a tremor of the upper limbs. One therapy option is high-frequency deep brain stimulation, which continuously delivers electrical stimulation to the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus at about 130 Hz. Investigators have been looking at stimulating less, chiefly to reduce side effects. One strategy, phase-locked deep brain stimulation, consists of stimulating according to the phase of the tremor, once per period. In this study, we aim to reproduce the phase dependent effects of stimulation seen in patient data with a biologically inspired Wilson-Cowan model. To this end, we first analyse patient data, and conclude that half of the datasets have response curves that are better described by sinusoidal curves than by straight lines, while an effect of phase cannot be consistently identified in the remaining half. Using the Hilbert phase we derive analytical expressions for phase and amplitude responses to phase-dependent stimulation and study their relationship in the linearisation of a stable focus model, a simplification of the Wilson-Cowan model in the stable focus regime. Analytical results provide a good approximation for response curves observed in patients with consistent significance. Additionally, we fitted the full non-linear Wilson-Cowan model to these patients, and we show that the model can fit in each case to the dynamics of patient tremor as well as the phase response curve, and the best fits are found to be stable foci for each patients (tied best fit in one instance). The model provides satisfactory prediction of how patient tremor will react to phase-locked stimulation by predicting patient amplitude response curves although they were not explicitly fitted. This can be partially explained by the relationship between the response curves in the model being compatible with what is found in the data. We also note that the non-linear Wilson-Cowan model is able to describe response to stimulation more precisely than the linearisation.",

    "abstract": "Concurrent molecular dating of population and species divergences is essential in many biological investigations, including phylogeography, phylodynamics, and species delimitation studies. Multiple sequence alignments used in these investigations frequently consist of both intra- and inter-species samples (mixed samples). As a result, the phylogenetic trees contain inter-species, inter-population, and within population divergences. To date these sequence divergences, Bayesian relaxed clock methods are often employed, but they assume the same tree prior for both inter- and intra-species branching processes and require specification of a clock model for branch rates (independent vs. autocorrelated rates models). We evaluated the impact of using the same tree prior on the Bayesian divergence time estimates by analyzing computer-simulated datasets. We also examined the effect of the assumption of independence of evolutionary rate variation among branches when the branch rates are autocorrelated. Bayesian approach with Skyline-coalescent tree priors generally produced excellent molecular dates, with some tree priors (e.g., Yule) performing the best when evolutionary rates were autocorrelated, and lineage sorting was incomplete. We compared the performance of the Bayesian approach with a non-Bayesian, the RelTime method, which does not require specification of a tree prior or selection of a clock model. We found that RelTime performed as well as the Bayesian approach, and when the clock model was mis-specified, RelTime performed slightly better. These results suggest that the computationally efficient RelTime approach is also suitable to analyze datasets containing both populations and species variation.",

    "abstract": "Identifying genetic markers for heterogeneous complex diseases such as heart failure has been challenging, and may require prohibitively large cohort sizes in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in order to demonstrate statistical significance1. On the other hand, chromatin quantitative trait loci (QTL), elucidated by direct epigenetic profiling of specific human tissues, may contribute towards prioritising variants for disease-association. Here, we captured non-coding genetic variants by performing enhancer H3K27ac ChIP-seq in 70 human control and end-stage failing hearts, mapping out a comprehensive catalogue of 47,321 putative human heart enhancers. 3,897 differential acetylation peaks (FDR < 0.05) pointed to recognizable pathways altered in heart failure (HF). To identify cardiac histone acetylation QTLs (haQTLs), we regressed out confounding factors including HF disease status, and employed the G-SCI test2 to call out 1,680 haQTLs (FDR < 0.1). A subset of these showed significant association to gene expression, either in cis (180), or through long range interactions (81), identified by Hi-C and Hi-ChIP performed on a subset of hearts. Furthermore, a concordant relationship was found between the gain or disruption of specific transcription factor (TF) binding motifs, inferred from alternative alleles at the haQTLs, associated with altered H3K27ac peak heights. Finally, colocalisation of our haQTLs with heart-related GWAS datasets allowed us to identify 62 unique loci. Disease-association for these new loci may indeed be mediated through modification of H3K27-acetylation enrichment and their corresponding gene expression differences.",

    "abstract": "Adequately localizing pain is crucial to protect the body against physical damage and react to the stimulus in external space having caused such damage. Accordingly, it is hypothesized that nociceptive inputs are remapped from a somatotopic reference frame, representing the skin surface, towards a spatiotopic frame, representing the body parts in external space. This ability is thought to be developed and shaped by early visual experience. To test this hypothesis, normally sighted and early blind participants performed temporal order judgment tasks during which they judged which of two nociceptive stimuli applied on each hands dorsum was perceived as first delivered. Crucially, tasks were performed with the hands either in an uncrossed posture or crossed over body midline. While early blinds were not affected by the posture, performances of the normally sighted participants decreased in the crossed condition relative to the uncrossed condition. This indicates that nociceptive stimuli were automatically remapped into a spatiotopic representation that interfered with somatotopy in normally sighted individuals, whereas early blinds seemed to mostly rely on a somatotopic representation to localize nociceptive inputs. Accordingly, the plasticity of the nociceptive system would not purely depend on bodily experiences but also on crossmodal interactions between nociception and vision during early sensory experience.",

    "abstract": "The saturation-recovery method is a frequently used NMR/MRI technique for the measurement of the longitudinal relaxation rate R1. Under noise influence, the accuracy and the precision of the measurement outcome depend on the selection of the recovery times. This work seeks to determine the optimal recovery-time selection when the total scan time is constrained. A Monte Carlo computational method was used to simulate the noise-influenced distribution of the R1 measurement for various combinations of the two recovery times and to find the combination that produces the minimal standard deviation. Using the sum of recovery times (SRT) as the total scan time, mathematical formulas are derived from the simulation covering the SRT range of [0.05T1, 15T1]. The formulas describe the relationship between the SRT, the optimal accuracy and precision, and the recovery-time selection, and reproduce the results for the cases previously validated with experiments. In clinical application, the scan time is limited by the scan subjects tolerance in the scanner and the time that can be allocated to the measurement in a scan session. These formulas provide a practical way to evaluate the trade-offs between precision and the scan time in scan planning.",

    "abstract": "The integrated stress response (ISR) is a cellular response system activated upon different types of stresses, including viral infection, to restore cellular homeostasis. However, many viruses manipulate this response for their own advantage. In this study we investigated the association between murine norovirus (MNV) infection and the ISR and demonstrate that MNV regulates the ISR by activating and recruiting key ISR host factors. We observed that during MNV infection, there is a progressive increase in phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (p-eIF2) resulting in the suppression of host translation, yet MNV translation still progresses under these conditions. Interestingly, the shutoff of host translation also impacts the translation of key signalling cytokines such as IFN{beta}, IL-6 and TNF. Our subsequent analyses revealed that the phosphorylation of eIF2 was mediated via Protein kinase-R (PKR), but further investigation revealed that PKR activation, phosphorylation of eIF2 and translational arrest were uncoupled during infection. We further observed that stress granules (SGs) are not induced during MNV infection, and MNV has the capacity to restrict SG nucleation and formation. We observed that MNV recruited the key SG nucleating protein G3BP1 to its replication sites and intriguingly the silencing of G3BP1 negatively impacts MNV replication. Thus, it appears, MNV utilises G3BP1 to enhance replication, but equally to prevent SG formation, intimating an anti-MNV property of SGs. Overall, thus study highlights MNV manipulation of SGs, PKR and translational control to regulate cytokine translation and to promote viral replication.\n\nImportanceViruses hijack host machinery and regulate cellular homeostasis to actively replicate their genome, propagate and cause disease. In retaliation, cells possess various defence mechanisms to detect, destroy and clear infecting viruses as well as signal to neighbouring cells to inform them of the imminent threat. In this study, we demonstrate that the murine norovirus (MNV) infection stalls host protein translation and the production of antiviral and pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, virus replication and protein translation still ensues. We show that MNV further prevents the formation of cytoplasmic RNA granules, called stress granules (SG), by recruiting the key host protein G3BP1 to the MNV replication complex; a recruitment that is crucial to establishing and maintaining virus replication. Thus MNV promotes immune evasion of the virus by altering protein translation. Together, this evasion strategy delays innate immune responses to MNV infection and accelerates disease onset.",

We bioprospected 16S rRNA amplicons, metagenomes, and metaproteomes from methane hydrate-bearing sediments under Hydrate Ridge (offshore Oregon, USA, ODP Site 1244, 2-69 mbsf) for novel microbial metabolic and biosynthetic potential. Atribacteria sequences generally increased in relative sequence abundance with increasing sediment depth. Most Atribacteria ASVs belonged to JS-1-Genus 1 and clustered with other sequences from gas hydrate-bearing sediments. We recovered 21 metagenome-assembled genomic bins spanning three geochemical zones in the sediment core: the sulfate-methane transition zone, metal (iron/manganese) reduction zone, and gas hydrate stability zone. We found evidence for bacterial fermentation as a source of acetate for aceticlastic methanogenesis and as a driver of iron reduction in the metal reduction zone. In multiple zones, we identified a Ni-Fe hydrogenase-Na+/H+ antiporter supercomplex (Hun) in Atribacteria and Firmicutes bins and in other deep subsurface bacteria and cultured hyperthermophiles from the Thermotogae phylum. Atribacteria expressed tripartite ATP-independent (TRAP) transporters downstream from a novel regulator (AtiR). Atribacteria also possessed adaptations to survive extreme conditions (e.g., high salt brines, high pressure, and cold temperatures) including the ability to synthesize the osmolyte di-myo-inositol-phosphate as well as expression of K+-stimulated pyrophosphatase and capsule proteins.\n\nOriginality-Significance StatementThis work provides insights into the metabolism and adaptations of microbes that are ubiquitous and abundant in methane-rich ecosystems.

    "abstract": "AimPhenology, the temporal response of a population to its climate, is a crucial behavioral trait shared across life on earth. How species adapt their phenologies to climate change is poorly understood but critical in understanding how species will respond to future change. We use a group of flies (Rhaphiomidas) endemic to the North American deserts to understand how species adapt to changing climatic conditions. Here we explore a novel approach for taxa with constrained phenologies aimed to accurately model their environmental niche and relate this to phenological and morphological adaptations in a phylogenetic context.\n\nTaxonInsecta, Diptera, Mydidae, Rhaphiomidas\n\nLocationNorth America, Mojave, Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts.\n\nMethodsWe gathered geographical and phenological occurrence data for the entire genus Rhaphiomidas, and, estimated a time calibrated phylogeny. We compared Daymet derived temperature values for a species adult occurrence period (phenology) with those derived from WorldClim data that is partitioned by month or quarter to examine what effect using more precise data has on capturing a species environmental niche. We then examined to what extent phylogenetic signal in phenological traits, climate tolerance and morphology can inform us about how species adapt to different environmental regimes.\n\nResultsWe found that the Bioclim temperature data, which are averages across monthly intervals, poorly represent the climate windows to which adult flies are actually adapted. Using temporally-relevant climate data, we show that many species use a combination of morphological and phenological changes to adapt to different climate regimes. There are also instances where species changed only phenology to track a climate type or only morphology to adapt to different environments.\n\nMain ConclusionsWithout using a fine-scale phenological data approach, identifying environmental adaptations could be misleading because the data do not represent the conditions the animals are actually experiencing. We find that fine-scale phenological niche models are needed when assessing taxa that have a discrete phenological window that is key to their survival, accurately linking environment to morphology and phenology. Using this approach, we show that Rhaphiomidas use a combination of niche tracking and adaptation to persist in new niches. Modeling the effect of phenology on such species niches will be critical for better predictions of how these species might respond to future climate change.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIncreasing childhood overweight and obesity rates are associated with not only adverse physical, but also mental health outcomes, including depression. These negative outcomes may be caused and/or exacerbated by the bullying and shaming overweight individuals experience. As body mass index (BMI) can be highly heritable, we hypothesized that a genetic risk toward higher BMI, will predict higher early life stress (ELS), which in turn will predict higher depressive symptoms in adulthood. Such a process will reflect an evocative gene-environment correlation (rGE) wherein an individuals genetically influenced phenotype evokes a reaction from the environment that subsequently shapes the individuals health.\n\nMethodsWe modeled genetic risk using a polygenic score of BMI derived from a recent large GWAS meta-analysis. Self-reports were used for the assessment of ELS and depressive symptoms in adulthood. The discovery sample consisted of 524 non-Hispanic Caucasian university students from the Duke Neurogenetics Study (DNS; 278 women, mean age 19.78{+/-}1.23 years) and the independent replication sample consisted of 5 930 white British individuals from the UK biobank (UKB; 3 128 women, mean age 62.66{+/-}7.38 years).\n\nResultsA significant mediation effect was found in the DNS (indirect effect=.207, bootstrapped SE=.10, 95% CI: .014 to .421), and then replicated in the UKB (indirect effect=.04, bootstrapped SE=.01, 95% CI: .018 to .066). Higher BMI polygenic scores were associated with higher depressive symptoms through the experience of higher ELS.\n\nConclusionsOur findings suggest that evocative rGE may contribute to weight-related mental health problems and stress the need for interventions that aim to reduce weight bias, specifically during childhood.",

    "abstract": "Emerald ash borer (EAB), Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire, is an invasive and destructive beetle that causes extensive damages to ash trees in North America. The entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana is considered as an effective biological control agent for EAB adult populations. Using an assisted autodissemination with the fungal isolate INRS-242 of B. bassiana, our research aims to investigate the possibility of horizontal transmission of the fungal disease from infected to uninfected EAB adults during mating. Results show that the efficiency of fungal transmission is significantly related to the sex of EAB carrying the pathogen. EAB males are the promising vector to transmit INRS-242 isolate of B. bassiana to their partners during mating. Results strengthen the potential of the fungal autodissemination device as a powerful biological strategy to control EAB populations.",

    "abstract": "Disease is both among the most important selection pressures in nature and among the main causes of yield loss in agriculture. In plants, resistance to disease is often conferred by Nucleotide-binding Leucine-rich Repeat (NLR) proteins. These proteins function as intracellular immune receptors that recognize pathogen proteins and their effects on the plant. Consistent with evolutionarily dynamic interactions between plants and pathogens, NLRs are known to be encoded by one of the most variable gene families in plants, but the true extent of intraspecific NLR diversity has been unclear. Here, we define the majority of the Arabidopsis thaliana species-wide \"NLRome\". From NLR sequence enrichment and long-read sequencing of 65 diverse A. thaliana accessions, we infer that the pan-NLRome saturates with approximately 40 accessions. Despite the high diversity of NLRs, half of the pan-NLRome is present in most accessions. We chart the architectural diversity of NLR proteins, identify novel architectures, and quantify the selective forces that act on specific NLRs, domains, and positions. Our study provides a blueprint for defining the pan-NLRome of plant species.",

    "abstract": "Aquatic predatory insects, like the nymphs of a dragonfly, use rapid movements to catch their prey. Dragonfly nymphs are voracious predators that feed on smaller aquatic organisms. In this study, we examine dragonfly nymph (Libellulidae: Insecta: Odonata) mouthparts that are used in prey capturing and feeding. In particular, we characterise the morphology of the labium and mechanical properties of the mandibles of the nymph. Additionally, we record and analyse the preying mechanism using high-speed photography. The morphological details suggest that the prey capturing mechanism is a complex grasping mechanism with additional sensory organs that might aid in sensing the surroundings. The times taken for the extension and retraction of labial organ during prey capture was 187{+/-}54 ms. The Youngs modulus and hardness of the mandibles samples were 9.1{+/-}1.9 GPa and 0.85{+/-}0.13 GPa. Gradation in the mechanical properties was also observed in the mandible tip regions with increased properties at the tip end. The overall mechanism with its sensory capabilities provides a unique design to develop bioinspired underwater deployable mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Cancer evolution is driven by the acquisition of somatic mutations that provide cells with a beneficial phenotype in a changing microenvironment. However, mutations that give rise to neoantigens, novel cancer-specific peptides that elicit an immune response, are likely to be disadvantageous. Here we show how the clonal structure and immunogenotype of growing tumours is shaped by negative selection in response to neoantigenic mutations. We construct a mathematical model of neoantigen evolution in a growing tumour, and verify the model using genomic sequencing data. The model predicts that, in the absence of active immune escape mechanisms, tumours either evolve clonal neoantigens (antigen-  hot), or have no clonally- expanded neoantigens at all (antigen-  cold), whereas antigen-  warm tumours (with high frequency subclonal neoantigens) form only following the evolution of immune evasion. Counterintuitively, strong negative selection for neoantigens during tumour formation leads to an increased number of antigen- warm or - hot tumours, as a consequence of selective pressure for immune escape. Further, we show that the clone size distribution under negative selection is effectively- neutral, and moreover, that stronger negative selection paradoxically leads to more neutral- like dynamics. Analysis of antigen clone sizes and immune escape in colorectal cancer exome sequencing data confirms these results. Overall, we provide and verify a mathematical framework to understand the evolutionary dynamics and clonality of neoantigens in human cancers that may inform patient- specific immunotherapy decision- making.",

    "abstract": "Genomic loci adjacent to genes encoding for transcription factors and chromatin remodelers are enriched for long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), but the functional importance of this enrichment is largely unclear. Chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 2 (Chd2) is a chromatin remodeller with various reported functions in cell differentiation and DNA damage response. Heterozygous mutations in human CHD2 have been implicated in epilepsy, neurodevelopmental delay, and intellectual disability. Here we show that Chaserr, a highly conserved lncRNA transcribed from a region near the transcription start site of Chd2 and on the same strand, acts in concert with the CHD2 protein to maintain proper Chd2 expression levels. Loss of Chaserr in mice leads to early postnatal lethality in homozygous mice, and severe growth retardation in heterozygotes. Mechanistically, loss of Chaserr leads to substantially increased Chd2 mRNA and protein levels, which in turn lead to increased transcriptional interference by inhibiting promoters found downstream of highly expressed genes. We further show that Chaserr production represses Chd2 expression solely in cis, and that the phenotypic consequences of Chaserr loss are rescued when Chd2 is perturbed as well. Targeting Chaserr is thus a potentially viable strategy for increasing CHD2 levels in haploinsufficient individuals.",

    "abstract": "The maturational schedule of typical brain development is tightly constrained; deviations from it are associated with cognitive atypicalities, and are potentially predictive of developmental disorders. Previously, we have shown that the white/gray contrast at the inner border of the cortex is a good predictor of chronological age, and is sensitive to aspects of brain development that reflect cognitive performance. Here we extend that work to include the contrast at the white/gray border of subcortical structures. We show that cortical and subcortical contrast together yield better age-predictions than any non-kernel-based method based on a single image-type, and that the residuals of the improved predictions provide new insight into unevenness in cognitive performance. We demonstrate the improvement in age predictions in two large datasets: the NIH Pediatric Data, with 831 scans of typically developing individuals between 4 and 22 years of age; and the Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics data, with 909 scans of individuals in a similar age-range. Assessment of the relation of the residuals of these age predictions to verbal and performance IQ revealed correlations in opposing directions, and a principal component analysis of the residuals of the model that best fit the contrast data produced components related to either performance IQ or verbal IQ. Performance IQ was associated with the first principle component, reflecting increased cortical contrast, broadly, with almost no subcortical presence; verbal IQ was associated with the second principle component, reflecting reduced contrast in the basal ganglia and increased contrast in the bilateral arcuate fasciculi.",

To date, however, there have been no longitudinal investigations of the effects of gonadal hormones on WM development in adolescents. We acquired T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRIs at two timepoints and saliva samples from 80 adolescents (52 females [11.10{+/-}1.05 years at Time 1; 12.75{+/-}1.37 years at Time 2] and 28 males [ages 11.91{+/-}0.88 years at Time 1; 13.79{+/-}0.95 years at Time 2] who were matched on pubertal stage at Time 1. We estimated mean fractional anisotropy (FA) from 10 major WM tracts and assayed levels of testosterone (in both sexes) and estradiol (in females only). We used linear regression models to test whether interactions between sex and changes in testosterone levels significantly explained changes in FA. Sex significantly moderated the associations between changes in testosterone and changes in FA within the corpus callosum, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), uncinate fasciculus (UF), and cingulum cingulate (all ps<0.05): whereas these associations were positive in females, they were not significant in males. Females also exhibited positive associations between changes in estradiol and changes in UF, IFOF, and corticospinal FA (all ps<0.05). Our findings indicate that sex differences in WM microstructure of tracts supporting cognitive control, response inhibition, and emotion regulation are explained by differences in changes in testosterone, and have important implications for understanding sex differences in brain development and psychosocial behaviors during the pubertal transition.",

Despite progress in this field, there is no docking method available for rigorous uncertainty quantification (UQ) of its solution quality (e.g. interface RMSD or iRMSD).\n\nResultsWe introduce a novel algorithm, Bayesian Active Learning (BAL), for optimization and UQof such black-box functions and flexible protein docking. BAL directly models the posterior distribution of the global optimum (or native structures for protein docking) with active sampling and posterior estimation iteratively feeding each other. Furthermore, we use complex normal modes to represent a homogeneous Euclidean conformation space suitable for high-dimension optimization and construct funnel-like energy models for encounter complexes. Over a protein docking benchmark set and a CAPRI set including homology docking, we establish that BAL significantly improve against both starting points by rigid docking and refinements by particle swarm optimization, providing for one third targets a top-3 near-native prediction. BAL also generates tight confidence intervals with half range around 25% of iRMSD and confidence level at 85%. Its estimated probability of a prediction being native or not achieves binary classification AUROC at 0.93 and AUPRC over 0.60 (compared to 0.14 by chance); and also found to help ranking predictions.

We report here B cell help functionality in a population of CD4+ T cells isolated from primary human lymph nodes (LN) that lacked CXCR5 expression. This CXCR5- subset is distinguished from other CXCR5- CD4+ T cells by high PD-1 expression. Accumulation of CXCR5-PD-1+ T cells correlated with peripheral CD4+ T cell depletion and an increase in T-bet+ B cells in the LN, highlighting these atypical CD4+ T cells as a key component of lymphoid dysregulation during chronic HIV infection. By interrogating the phenotypic heterogeneity, functional capacity, TCR repertoire, transcriptional profile, and epigenetic state of CXCR5-PD-1+ T cells, we showed that CXCR5-PD-1+ T cells are related to CXCR5+PD-1+ T cells and provided evidence for the down regulation of CXCR5 following cell division as one mechanism for the absence of CXCR5 expression. Notably, CXCR5-PD-1+ T cells exhibited a migratory transcriptional program and contributed to circulating CXCR5-PD-1+ T cells with B cell help functionality in the peripheral blood.

    "abstract": "In open environments such as water, enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 responds to inorganic phosphate (Pi) starvation by inducing the Pho regulon controlled by PhoB. The phosphate-specific transport (Pst) system is the high-affinity Pi transporter. In the {Delta}pst mutant, PhoB is constitutively activated and regulates the expression of genes from the Pho regulon. In E. coli O157:H7, the {Delta}pst mutant, biofilm, and autoagglutination were increased. In the double-deletion mutant {Delta}pst {Delta}phoB, biofilm and autoagglutination were similar to the wild-type strain, suggesting that PhoB is involved. We investigated the relationship between PhoB activation and enhanced biofilm formation by screening a transposon mutant library derived from {Delta}pst mutant for decreased autoagglutination and biofilms mutants. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) genes involved in the synthesis of the LPS core were identified. Transcriptomic studies indicate the influence of Pi-starvation and pst mutation on LPS biosynthetic gene expression. LPS analysis indicated that the O-antigen was deficient in the {Delta}pst mutant. Interestingly, waaH, encoding a glycosyltransferase associated with LPS modifications in E. coli K-12, was highly expressed in the {Delta}pst mutant of E. coli O157:H7. Deletion of waaH from the {Delta}pst mutant and from the wild-type strain grown in Pi-starvation conditions decreased the biofilm formation but without affecting LPS. Our findings suggest that LPS core is involved in the autoagglutination and biofilm phenotypes of the {Delta}pst mutant and that WaaH plays a role in biofilm in response to Pi-starvation. This study highlights the importance of Pi-starvation in biofilm formation of E. coli O157:H7, which may affect its transmission and persistence.\n\nIMPORTANCEEnterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 is a human pathogen responsible for bloody diarrhea and renal failures. In the environment, O157:H7 can survive for prolonged periods of time under nutrient-deprived conditions. Biofilms are thought to participate in this environmental lifestyle. Previous reports have shown that the availability of extracellular inorganic phosphate (Pi) affected bacterial biofilm formation; however, nothing was known about O157:H7 biofilm formation. Our results show that O157:H7 membrane undergoes modifications upon PhoB activation leading to increased biofilm formation. A mutation in the Pst system results in reduced amount of the smooth type LPS and that this could influence the biofilm composition. This demonstrates how the E. coli O157:H7 adapts to Pi starvation increasing its ability to occupy different ecological niches.",

Most past research has employed tasks with two stimulus categories, but such designs cannot fully capture the limitations inherent in naturalistic perceptual decisions where choices are rarely between only two alternatives. We conducted four experiments with tasks involving multiple alternatives and used computational modeling to determine the decision-level representation on which the perceptual decisions were based. The results from all four experiments pointed to the existence of robust suboptimality such that most of the information in the sensory representation was lost during the transformation to a decision-level representation. These results reveal severe limits in the quality of decision-level representations for multiple alternatives and have strong implications about perceptual decision making in naturalistic settings.",

    "abstract": "Our sensory environment changes constantly. Accordingly, neural systems continually adapt to the concurrent stimulus statistics to remain sensitive over a wide range of conditions. Such dynamic range adaptation (DRA) is assumed to increase both the effectiveness of the neuronal code and perceptual sensitivity. However, direct demonstrations of DRA-based efficient neuronal processing that also produces perceptional benefits are lacking. Here we investigated the impact of DRA on spatial coding in the rodent brain and the perception of human listeners. Naturalistic spatial stimulation with dynamically changing source locations elicited prominent DRA already on the initial spatial processing stage, the Lateral Superior Olive (LSO) of gerbils of either sex. Surprisingly, on the level of individual neurons, DRA diminished spatial tuning due to large response variability across trials. However, when considering single-trial population averages of multiple neurons, DRA enhanced the coding efficiency specifically for the concurrently most probable source locations. Intrinsic LSO population imaging of energy consumption combined with pharmacology revealed that a slow-acting LSO gain control mechanism distributes activity across a group of neurons during DRA, thereby enhancing population coding efficiency. Strikingly, such \"efficient cooperative coding\" also improved neuronal source separability specifically for the locations that were most likely to occur. These location-specific enhancements in neuronal coding were paralleled by human listeners exhibiting a selective improvement in spatial resolution. We conclude that, contrary to canonical models of sensory encoding, the primary motive of early spatial processing is efficiency optimization of neural populations for enhanced source separability in the concurrent environment.\n\nAuthor summaryThe renowned efficient coding hypothesis suggests that neural systems adapt their processing to the statistics of the environment to maximize information while minimizing the underlying energetic costs. It is further assumed that such neuronal adaptations also confer perceptual advantages. Yet direct demonstrations of adaptive mechanisms or strategies that result both in increased neuronal coding efficiency and perceptual benefits are lacking. Here we show that an auditory spatial processing circuit exploits slow-acting gain control to distribute activity across the neuronal population, thereby enhancing coding efficiency based on single-trial population averages. This population-efficiency maximization also results in improved neuronal spatial resolution for the concurrently most probable source locations, which was resembled in a focally improved spatial acuity of human listeners.",

This study aimed to explore headteachers, teachers and pupils views and experiences of an outdoor learning programme within the key stage two curriculum (ages 9-11). We examine the process of implementation to offer case study evidence through 1:1 interviews with headteachers (n=3) and teachers (n=10) and focus groups with pupils aged 9-11 (n=10) from three primary schools. Interviews and focus groups were conducted at baseline and six months into implementation. Schools introduced regular outdoor learning within the curriculum. This study found a variety of perceived benefits for pupils and schools. Pupils and teachers noticed improvements in pupils engagement with learning, concentration and behaviour, as well as positive impacts on health and wellbeing and teachers job satisfaction. Curriculum demands including testing and evidencing work were barriers to implementation, in addition to safety concerns, resources and teacher confidence. Participants supported outdoor learning as a curriculum-based programme for older primary school pupils. However, embedding outdoor learning within the curriculum requires education inspectorates to place higher value on this approach in achieving curricular aims, alongside greater acknowledgment of the wider benefits to children which current measurements do not capture.",

    "abstract": "It remains unknown if biophysical or material properties of biomolecular condensates regulate cancer. Here we show that AKAP95, a nuclear protein that regulates transcription and RNA splicing, plays an important role in tumorigenesis by supporting cancer cell growth and suppressing oncogene-induced senescence. AKAP95 forms phase-separated and liquid-like condensates in vitro and in nucleus. Mutations of key residues to different amino acids perturb AKAP95 condensation in opposite directions. Importantly, the activity of AKAP95 in splice regulation is abolished by disruption of condensation, significantly impaired by hardening of condensates, and regained by substituting its condensation-mediating region with other condensation-mediating regions from irrelevant proteins. Moreover, the abilities of AKAP95 in regulating gene expression and supporting tumorigenesis require AKAP95 to form condensates with proper liquidity and dynamicity. These results link phase separation to tumorigenesis and uncover an important role of appropriate biophysical properties of protein condensates in gene regulation and cancer.",

    "abstract": "T cells have a range of cytotoxic and immune-modulating functions, depending on activation state and subtype. However, current methods to assess T cell function use exogenous labels that often require cell permeabilization, which is limiting for time-course studies of T cell activation and non-destructive quality control of immunotherapies. Label-free optical imaging is an attractive solution. Here, we use autofluorescence imaging of NAD(P)H and FAD, co-enzymes of metabolism, to quantify optical imaging endpoints in quiescent and activated T cells. Machine learning classification models were developed for label-free, non-destructive determination of T cell activation state. T cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of human donors, and a subset were activated with a tetrameric antibody against CD2/CD3/CD28 surface ligands. NAD(P)H and FAD autofluorescence intensity and lifetime of the T cells were imaged using a multiphoton fluorescence lifetime microscope. Significant differences in autofluorescence imaging end-points were observed between quiescent and activated T cells. Feature selection methods revealed that the contribution of the short NAD(P)H lifetime (1) is the most important feature for classification of activation state, across multiple donors and T cell subsets. Logistic regression models achieved 97-99% accuracy for classification of T cell activation from the autofluorescence imaging endpoints. Additionally, autofluorescence imaging revealed NAD(P)H and FAD autofluorescence differences between CD3+CD8+ and CD3+CD4+ T cells, and random forest models of the autofluorescence imaging endpoints achieved 97+% accuracy for four-group classification of quiescent and activated CD3+CD8+ and CD3+CD4+ T cells. Altogether these results indicate that autofluorescence imaging of NAD(P)H and FAD is a powerful method for label-free, non-destructive determination of T cell activation and subtype, which could have important applications for the treatment of cancer, autoimmune, infectious, and other diseases.",

    "abstract": "There is strong evidence supporting the association between Alzheimers disease (AD) and protein-coding variants, R47H and R62H in TREM2. The TREM2 protein is an immune receptor found in brain microglia. A structural alteration could therefore have a large effect on the protein. Crystallised structures were used as a base for both WT and mutated proteins. These subjected to 300ns of molecular dynamic simulation (MD). Results suggest structural alterations in both mutated forms of TREM2. A large change was noted in the R47H simulation in the complementarity-determining region two (CDR2) binding loop, a proposed binding sites for ligands such as APOE, a smaller change was observed in the R62H model. These differing levels of structural impact could explain the in vitro observed differences in TREM2-ligand binding.\n\nAuthor SummaryA number of mutations have been found in the TREM2 protein in populations of people with Alzheimers and other dementias. Two of these mutations are similar in that the both cause the same coding change in the same domain of the protein. However, they both cause a very different result in terms of risk and in vitro observed changes. Why these two similar mutations are so different is largely unknown. Here we have used a in silico, simulation, approach to understanding the structural changes which occur in both of the mutations. Our results suggest that the mutation which carries a higher risk, but it less commonly observed, has a much larger impact on the protein structure than the mutation which is thought to be less damaging. This structural change is observed at a part of the protein which is thought to code for a binding loop and a change here could have a big impact on the proteins function. Further studies to investigate this binding loop could help not only a better understanding of TREM2s role in the onset of dementia but also possibly provide a target for therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Development of eye tissue is initiated by a conserved set of transcripton factors termed retinal determination network (RDN). In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the zinc-finger transcription factor Glass acts directly downstream of the RDN to control idendity of photoreceptor as well as non-photoreceptors cells. Tight control of spatial and temporal gene expression is a critical feature during development, cell-fate determination as well as maintainance of differentiated tissues. The molecular mechanisms that control expression of glass, however remain largely unknown. We here identify complex regulatory mechanisms controlling expression of the glass locus. All information to recapitulate glass expression are contained in a compact 5.2 kb cis-acting genomic element by combining different cell-type specific and general enhancers with repressor elements. Moreover, the immature RNA of the locus contains an alterantive small open reading frame (smORF) upstream of the actual glass translation start, resulting in a small peptide instead of the three possible glass protein isoforms. CRISPR/Cas9-based mutagenesis shows that the smORF is not required for the formation of functioning photoreceptors, but to attenuate effects of glass misexpression. Furthermore, editing the genome to generate glass loci eliminating either one or two isoforms shows that only one of the three proteins is critical for formation of functioning photoreceptors, while removing the two other isoforms did not cause defects in developmental or photoreceptor function. Our results show that eye development and function is surprisingly robust and appears buffered to targeted manipulations of critical features of the glass transcript, suggesting a strong selection pressure to allow the formation of a functioning eye.",

    "abstract": "Colletotrichum tanaceti is an emerging foliar fungal pathogen of pyrethrum (Tanacetum cinerariifolium), posing a threat to the global pyrethrum industry. Despite being reported consistently from field surveys in Australia, the molecular basis of pathogenicity of C. tanaceti on pyrethrum is unknown. Herein, the genome of C. tanaceti (isolate BRIP57314) was assembled de novo and annotated using transcriptomic evidence. The inferred pathogenicity gene suite of C. tanaceti comprised a large array of genes encoding secreted effectors, proteases, CAZymes and secondary metabolites. Comparative analysis of its CAZyme pathogenicity profiles with those of closely related species suggested that C. tanaceti had additional hosts to pyrethrum. The genome of C. tanaceti had a high repeat content and repetitive elements were located significantly closer to genes inferred to influence pathogenicity than other genes. These repeats are likely to have accelerated mutational and transposition rates in the genome, resulting in a rapid evolution of certain CAZyme families in this species. The C. tanaceti genome consisted of a gene-sparse, A-T rich region facilitating a \"two-speed\" genome. Pathogenicity genes within this region were likely to have a higher evolutionary rate than the  core genome. This \"two-speed\" genome phenomenon in certain Colletotrichum spp. was hypothesized to have caused the clustering of species based on the pathogenicity genes, to deviate from taxonomy. With the large repertoire of pathogenicity factors that can potentially evolve rapidly in response to control measures, C. tanaceti may pose a high-risk to global pyrethrum production. Knowledge of the pathogenicity genes will facilitate future research in disease management of C. tanaceti and other Colletotrichum spp..",

Here, we performed NGS to investigate tprK of T. pallidum directly from primary and secondary syphilis samples. Compared with diversity in tprK of the strains from primary syphilis samples, there were more mixture variants found within seven V regions of the tprK gene among the strains from secondary syphilis samples, and the frequencies of predominant sequences within V regions of tprK were generally decreased (less than 80%) with the proportion of minor variants in 10-60% increasing.

    "abstract": "Working memory (WM) performance can be enhanced by an informative cue presented during storage. This effect, termed a retrocue benefit, can be used to explore how observers prioritize information stored in WM to guide behavior. Recent studies have demonstrated that neural representations of task-relevant memoranda are strengthened following the appearance of a retrocue, suggesting that participants can consult alternative information stores to supplement active memory traces. Here, we sought to better understand the nature of these memory store(s) by asking whether they are subject to the same temporal degradation seen in active memory representations. We reconstructed and quantified representations of remembered positions from alpha-band EEG activity recorded while participants performed a retrospectively cued spatial WM task, and varied the temporal interval separating the encoding display and retrocue. Although we observed a partial recovery of location information in all cue conditions, the magnitude of recovery was linearly and inversely related to the timing of the retrocue. This suggests that participants ability to supplement active memory representations with information from additional memory stores is not static: the information maintained in these stores may be subject to temporal degredation, or the stores themselves may become more difficult to access with time.",

Still, the same reasoning holds if we substitute \"brain activity\" with \"brain alteration\" and \"cognitive process\" with \"brain disorder\". To assess the involvement of a certain alteration pattern in a brain disorder we used the Bayes factor technique on voxel-based morphometry data of schizophrenia and Alzheimers disease. This technique allows to calculate the ratio between the likelihoods of two alternative hypotheses (in our case, that the alteration of the voxel is specific for the brain disorder under scrutiny or that the alteration is not specific). We then performed temporal simulations of the alteration spread associated with different pathologies. The Bayes factor values calculated on these simulated data were able to reveal that the areas which are more specific to a certain disease are also the ones to be early altered.",

    "abstract": "Cortical entrainment to the (quasi-) rhythmic components of speech seems to play an important role in speech comprehension. It has been suggested that neural entrainment may reflect top-down temporal predictions of sensory signals. Key properties of a predictive model are its anticipatory nature and its ability to reconstruct missing information. Here we put both these two properties to experimental test. We acoustically presented sentences and measured cortical entrainment to both acoustic speech envelope and lips kinematics acquired from the speaker but not visible to the participants. We then analyzed speech-brain and lips-brain coherence at multiple negative and positive lags. Besides the well-known cortical entrainment to the acoustic speech envelope, we found significant entrainment in the delta range to the (latent) lips kinematics. Most interestingly, the two entrainment phenomena were temporally dissociated. While entrainment to the acoustic speech peaked around +0.3 s lag (i.e., when EEG followed speech by 0.3 s), entrainment to the lips was significantly anticipated and peaked around 0-0.1 s lag (i.e., when EEG was virtually synchronous to the putative lips movement). Our results demonstrate that neural entrainment during speech listening involves the anticipatory reconstruction of missing information related to lips movement production, indicating its fundamentally predictive nature and thus supporting analysis by synthesis models.",

    "abstract": "Research on male clients of male sex workers (MCMSW) has been neglected for a long time globally. We aimed to characterize MCMSW and to identify factors associated with their sexual practices using data from the prospective cohort study CohMSM conducted in Burkina Faso, Cote dIvoire, Mali and Togo. Our study focused on HIV-negative men who have sex with other men (MSM) recruited between 06/2015 and 01/2018 by a team of trained peer educators. Scheduled study visits at 6, 12 and 18 months included medical examinations, HIV screening, risk-reduction counselling and face-to-face interviews to collect information on their sociodemographic characteristics, sexual behaviours, and HIV risk-reduction strategies (HIV-RRS). Three stigmatization sub-scores were constructed (experienced, perceived and internalized). Mixed-effects logistic regression was used for data analysis. Of the 280 participants recruited at baseline, 238, 211 and 118, respectively, had a follow-up visit at 6, 12 and 18 months. Over a total of 847 visits, 47 transactional sex (TS) encounters were reported by 38 MCMSW (13.6%). Of the latter, only one participant reported systematic TS (2.6%), 18 (47.4 %) stopped reporting TS after baseline, and 6 (15.8%) reported TS after baseline. Thirteen participants (34.2 %) reported occasional TS. After adjusting for country of study and age, the following self-reported factors were associated with a greater likelihood of being MCMSW: protected anal sex, exclusively insertive anal sex with male sexual partners, avoidance of sex after consuming psychoactive products and experiencing stigmatization (all during the previous 6 months). The majority of MCMSW in this study employed HIV-RRS with male sexual partners, including engaging in protected anal sex, avoidance of sex when consuming psychoactive products, and practising exclusively insertive anal sex.",

Using a local mapping population of Arabidopsis thaliana, we set up a Genome Wide Association study to estimate the extent of genetic variation of the competitive response in presence of 12 plant species assemblages, and to compare the genetic architecture of the competitive response between monospecific and plurispecific neighborhoods. Based on four phenotypic traits, we detected strong crossing reaction norms not only among the three monospecific neighborhoods, but also among the different plant assemblages. Accordingly, the genetic architecture of the competitive response was highly dependent on the identity and the relative abundance of the neighboring species. In addition, enriched biological processes underlying the competitive response largely differ between monospecific and plurispecific neighborhoods. In particular, receptor-like kinases and transporters were significantly enriched in plurispecific neighborhoods. Our results suggest that plants can integrate and respond to different species assemblages depending on the identity and number of each neighboring species, through a large range of genes associated mainly with perception and signaling processes leading to developmental and stress responses.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence show that neuroinflammation plays a role in many neurological diseases including mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimers disease (AD), and that free water (FW) modeling from clinically acquired diffusion MRI (DTI-like acquisitions) can be sensitive to this phenomenon. This FW index measures the fraction of the diffusion signal explained by isotropically unconstrained water, as estimated from a bi-tensor model. In this study, we developed a simple FW processing pipeline that uses a safe white matter (WM) mask without gray matter (GM)/CSF partial volume contamination (WMsafe) near ventricles and sulci. We investigated if FW inside the WMsafe mask, including and excluding areas of white matter damage such as white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) as shown on T2 FLAIR, computed across the whole white matter could be indicative of diagnostic grouping along the AD continuum.\n\nAfter careful quality control, 81 cognitively normal controls (NC), 103 subjects with MCI and 42 with AD were selected from the ADNIGO and ADNI2 databases. We show that MCI and AD have significantly higher FW measures even after removing all partial volume contamination. We also show, for the first time, that when WMHs are removed from the masks, the significant results are maintained, which demonstrates that the FW measures are not just a byproduct of WMHs. Our new and simple FW measures can be used to increase our understanding of the role of inflammation-associated edema in AD and may aid in the differentiation of healthy subjects from MCI and AD patients.",

    "abstract": "The Aedes aegypti mosquito serves as a major vector for viral diseases, such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, which are spreading across the globe and threatening public health. In addition to increased vector transmission, the prevalence of insecticide-resistant mosquitoes is also on the rise, thus solidifying the need for new, safe and effective insecticides to control mosquito populations. We recently discovered that cinnamodial, a unique drimane sesquiterpene dialdehyde of the Malagasy medicinal plant Cinnamosma fragrans, exhibited significant larval and adult toxicity to Ae. aegypti and was more efficacious than DEET - the gold standard for insect repellents - at repelling adult female Ae. aegypti from blood feeding. In this study several semisynthetic analogues of cinnamodial were prepared to probe the structure-activity relationship (SAR) for larvicidal, adulticidal and antifeedant activity against Ae. aegypti. Initial efforts were focused on modification of the dialdehyde functionality to produce more stable active analogues and to understand the importance of the 1,4-dialdehyde and the ,{beta}-unsaturated carbonyl in the observed bioactivity of cinnamodial against mosquitoes. This study represents the first investigation into the SAR of cinnamodial as an insecticide and repellent against the medically important Ae. aegypti mosquito.",

PAI reporter genes would allow for monitoring of cell and gene therapies, but current reporters have immunogenicity and/or toxicity concerns that may limit clinical translation. Here we report a PAI reporter system employing the ability of human organic anion transporting polypeptide 1b3 (Oatp1b3) to take up the clinical dye indocyanine green (ICG) into cells. Following ICG administration, cells synthetically expressing Oatp1b3 exhibited significantly increased PAI signals compared to control cells both in vitro and in mice. Several benefits of this technology are the human derivation of Oatp1b3, and the high extinction coefficient, low quantum yield and pre-existing clinical approval of ICG. We posit that the Oatp1b3-ICG reporter system could be useful for in vivo gene and cell tracking in preclinical and clinical applications.",

We investigated the effect of substrates on the conformational dynamics of six SBPs and the impact on transport. Using single-molecule FRET, we reveal an unrecognized diversity of plasticity in SBPs. We show that a unique closed SBP conformation does not exist for transported substrates. Instead, SBPs sample a range of conformations that activate transport. Certain non-transported ligands leave the structure largely unaltered or trigger a conformation distinct from that of transported substrates. Intriguingly, in some cases similar SBP conformations are formed by both transported and non-transported ligands. In this case, the inability for transport arises from slow opening of the SBP or the selectivity provided by the translocator.

We show in {beta}-cells from 80 human donors that the glucose-dependent amplification of exocytosis is disrupted in T2D. Spatial analyses of granule fusion events, visualized by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, demonstrate that these are non-random across the surface of {beta}-cells from donors with no diabetes (ND). The compartmentalization of events occurs within regions defined by concurrent or recent membrane-resident secretory granules. This organization, and the number of membrane-associated granules, is glucose-dependent and notably impaired in T2D {beta}-cells. Mechanistically, multi-channel Kv2.1 clusters contribute to maintaining the density of membrane-resident granules and the number of fusion  hot spots, while SUMOylation sites at the channel N-(K145) and C-terminus (K470) determine the relative proportion of fusion events occurring within these regions. Thus, a glucose-dependent compartmentalization of fusion, regulated in part by a structural role for Kv2.1, is disrupted in {beta}-cells from donors with type 2 diabetes.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIExocytosis of secretory granules is non-random across the surface of human {beta}-cells, and this organization is disrupted in type 2 diabetes.\nC_LIO_LIIncreasing glucose facilitates the spatial compartmentalization of fusion, independent of an overall increase in event frequency.\nC_LIO_LICompartmentalized  hot spots occur at sites marked by membrane-associated granules, the density of which is regulated in part by a clustered K+ channel (Kv2.1).\nC_LIO_LISUMOylation status of the channel controls the proportion of events that occur within these local regions.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Maturation of sensory systems in mammals is regulated by appropriate sensory stimulation. Developmental refinement of the eye and visual system is regulated by light and visual stimulation. One compelling example is that fetal mouse pups deprived of light exhibit altered vascular development in their eyes. Previous work demonstrated that light activation of the photopigment melanopsin (Opn4), an atypical opsin expressed in intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), is crucial to normal vascular development. This suggested the unusual hypothesis that vascular development of the eye was regulated by ipRGC responses in the fetal eye by light that traveled through the body wall of the mother. Here, we test the requirement of OPN4 during fetal stages using genetic approaches. The G-protein GNAQ (Gq) is a candidate mediator of melanopsin signaling. We show that ipRGC-specific deletion of Gnaq phenocopies both hyaloid and retinal vascular development of the Opn4 null mouse. Furthermore, GNAQ gain-of-function in Opn4-expressing cells only during late gestation was sufficient to reverse the consequences for vascular development of either dark rearing or Opn4 loss-of-function. We conclude that melanopsin-dependent signaling in the fetal mouse eye is necessary and sufficient for vascular maturation.",

    "abstract": "While the impact of light on primary productivity in aquatic systems has been studied for decades, the role light plays in the degradation of photosynthetically-produced biomass is less well understood. We investigated the patterns of light-induced particle breakdown and bacterial assimilation of detrital C and N using 13C and 15N labeled freeze-thawed diatom cells incubated in laboratory microcosms with a marine microbial community freshly-collected from the Pacific Ocean. Particles incubated in the dark resulted in increased bacterial counts and dissolved organic carbon concentrations compared to those incubated in the light. Light also influenced the attached and free-living microbial community structure as detected by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. For example, bacterial taxa from the Sphingobacteriia were enriched on dark-incubated particles and taxa from the family Flavobacteriaceae and the genus Pseudoalteromonas were numerically enriched on particles in the light. Isotope incorporation analysis by phylogenetic microarray and NanoSIMS (a method called Chip-SIP) identified free-living and attached microbial taxa able to incorporate N and C from the particles. Some taxa, including members of the Flavobacteriaceae and Cryomorphaceae, exhibited increased isotope incorporation in the light, suggesting the use of photoheterotrophic metabolisms. In contrast, some members of Oceanospirillales and Rhodospirillales showed decreased isotope incorporation in the light, suggesting that their heterotrophic metabolism, particularly when occurring on particles, might increase at night or may be inhibited by sunlight. These results show that light influences particle degradation and C and N incorporation by attached bacteria, suggesting that the transfer between particulate and free-living phases are likely affected by external factors that change with the light regime, such as time of day, depth and season.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThere are over 200 published species within the Lactobacillus Genus Complex (LGC), the majority of which have sequenced type strain genomes available. Although gold standard, genome-based species delimitation cutoffs are accepted by the community, they are seldom checked against currently available genome data. In addition, there are many species-level misclassification issues within the LGC. We constructed a de novo species taxonomy for the LGC based on 2,459 publicly available, decent-quality genomes and using a 94% core nucleotide identity threshold. We reconciled these de novo species with published species and subspecies names by (i) identifying genomes of type strains in our dataset and (ii) performing comparisons based on 16S rRNA sequence identity against type strains.\n\nResultsWe found that genomes within the LGC could be divided into 239 clusters (de novo species) that were discontinuous and exclusive. Comparison of these de novo species to published species lead to the identification of ten sets of published species that can be merged and one species that can be split. Further, we found at least eight genome clusters that constitute new species. Finally, we were able to accurately classify 98 unclassified genomes and reclassify 74 wrongly classified genomes.\n\nConclusionsThe current state of LGC species taxonomy is largely consistent with genome data, but there are some inconsistencies as well as genome misclassifications. These inconsistencies should be resolved to evolve towards a meaningful taxonomy where species have a consistent size in terms of sequence divergence.",

    "abstract": "Reconsolidation disruption has been proposed as a method to attenuate pathological memories in disorders such as PTSD. However, studies from our group and others indicate that strong memories are resistant to becoming destabilized following reactivation, rendering them impervious to agents that disrupt the re-stabilization phase of reconsolidation. Thus, therapies designed to attenuate maladaptive memories by disrupting reconsolidation updating have not been adequately developed. We previously determined that animals possessing strong auditory fear memories, compared to animals with weaker fear memories, are associated with an enduring increase in the synaptic GluN2A/GluN2B ratio in neurons of the mouse basal and lateral amygdala (BLA). In this study, we determined whether increasing GluN2B levels within BLA excitatory neuronal synapses is sufficient to enable modification of strong fear memories via reconsolidation. To accomplish this, we utilized a combinatorial genetic strategy to express GluN2B or GluN2B(E1479Q) in excitatory neurons of the mouse BLA before or after fear memory consolidation. GluN2B(E1479Q) contains a point mutation that increases synaptic expression of the subunit by interfering with phosphorylation-driven endocytosis. At the time of memory retrieval, increasing synaptic GluN2B levels by expression of GluN2B(E1479Q), but not GluN2B(WT), enhanced the induction of reconsolidation rendering the strong fear memory modifiable. GluN2B(WT) or GluN2B(E1479Q) expression did not influence fear memory maintenance or extinction. Fear memory consolidation, however, was enhanced when GluN2B(E1479Q) was expressed in the BLA at the time of training. These findings indicate that enhancing GluN2B synaptic trafficking may provide a novel therapeutic strategy to enhance modification of pathological memories.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative assessment of antibiotic-responsive RNA transcripts holds promise for a rapid point of care (POC) diagnostic tool for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. These assays aim to distinguish susceptible and resistant isolates by transcriptional differences upon drug exposure. However, an often-overlooked dimension of designing these tests is that the genetic diversity within a species may yield differential transcriptional regulation independent of resistance phenotype. Here, we use a phylogenetically diverse panel of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and transcriptome profiling coupled with RT-qPCR to test this hypothesis, to identify azithromycin responsive transcripts and evaluate their potential diagnostic value, and to evaluate previously reported diagnostic markers for ciprofloxacin resistance (porB and rpmB). Transcriptome profiling confirmed evidence of population structure in transcriptional response to azithromycin. Taking this population structure into account, we found azithromycin-responsive transcripts overrepresented in susceptible strains compared to resistant strains, and selected four candidate diagnostic transcripts (rpsO, rplN, omp3, and NGO1079) that were the most significantly differentially regulated between phenotypes across drug exposure. RNA signatures for these markers categorically predicted resistance in 19/20 cases, with the one incorrect categorical assignment for an isolate at the threshold of reduced susceptibility. Finally, we found that porB and rpmB expression were not diagnostic of ciprofloxacin resistance in a panel of isolates with unbiased phylogenetic sampling. Overall, our results suggest that RNA signatures as a diagnostic tool are promising for future POC diagnostics; however, development and testing should consider representative genetic diversity of the target pathogen.",

    "abstract": "The Red Queens hypothesis portrays evolution as a never-ending competition for expansive energy, where one species gain is another species loss. The Red Queen is neutral with respect to body size, implying that neither small nor large species have a universal competitive advantage. The maximum population growth in ecology; however, clearly depends on body size - the smaller the species, the shorter the generation length, and the faster it can expand. Here we ask whether, and if so how, the Red Queens hypothesis can accommodate a spectrum of body sizes. We theoretically analyse scaling of expansive energy with body mass and demonstrate that in the Red Queens zero-sum game for resources, neither small nor large species have a universal evolutionary advantage. We argue that smaller species have an evolutionary advantage only when resources in the environment are not fully occupied, such as after mass extinctions or following key innovations allowing expansion into freed up or previously unoccupied resource space. Under such circumstances, we claim, generation length is the main limiting factor for population growth. When competition for resources is weak, smaller species can indeed expand faster, but to sustain this growth they also need more resources. In the Red Queens realm, where resources are fully occupied and the only way for expansion is to outcompete other species, acquisition of expansive energy becomes the limiting factor and small species lose their physiological advantage. A gradual transition from unlimited resources to a zero-sum game offers a direct mechanistic explanation for observed body mass trends in the fossil record, known as Copes Rule. When the system is far from the limit of resources and competition is not maximally intense, small species take up ecological space faster. When the system approaches the limits of its carrying capacity and competition tightens, small species lose their evolutionary advantage and we observe a wider range of successful body masses, and, as a result, an increase in the average body mass within lineages.",

However, the landscape of RTs in different, normal somatic cell types in humans remains largely unknown. Using single-cell whole-genome sequencing we identified 528 RT events, including LINE-1 (L1), and Alu, in 164 single cells and clones of fibroblasts, neurons, B lymphocytes, hepatocytes and liver stem cells, of 29 healthy human subjects aged from 0 to 106 years. The frequency of RTs was found to vary from <1 on average per cell in primary fibroblasts to 7.8 per cell in hepatocytes. Somewhat surprisingly, RT frequency does not increase with age, which is in contrast to other types of spontaneous mutation. RTs were found significantly more likely to insert in or close to target genes of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which represses most of the genes encoding developmental regulators through H3K27me3 histone modification in embryonic stem cells. Indeed, when directly comparing RT frequency between differentiated liver hepatocytes with liver stem cells, the latter were almost devoid of RTs. These results indicate that spontaneous RTs are associated with cellular differentiation and occur, possibly, as a consequence of the transient chromatin transition of differentiation-specific genes from a transcriptionally repressed to activated state during the differentiation process.",

    "abstract": "Spindle microtubules, whose dynamics vary over time and at different locations, cooperatively drive chromosome segregation. Measurements of microtubule dynamics and spindle ultrastructure can provide insight into the behaviors of microtubules, helping elucidate the mechanism of chromosome segregation. Much work has focused on the dynamics and organization of kinetochore microtubules, i.e. on the region between chromosomes and poles. In comparison, microtubules in the central spindle region, between segregating chromosomes, have been less thoroughly characterized. Here, we report measurements of the movement of central spindle microtubules during chromosome segregation in human mitotic spindles, and Caenorhabditis elegans mitotic and female meiotic spindles. We found that these central spindle microtubules slide apart at the same speed as chromosomes, even as chromosomes move towards spindle poles. In these systems, damaging central spindle microtubules by laser ablation caused an immediate and complete cessation of chromosome motion, suggesting a strong coupling between central spindle microtubules and chromosomes. Electron tomographic reconstruction revealed that the analyzed anaphase spindles all contain microtubules with both ends between segregating chromosomes. Our results provide new dynamical, functional, and ultrastructural characterizations of central spindle microtubules during chromosome segregation in diverse spindles, and suggest that central spindle microtubules and chromosomes are strongly coupled in anaphase.",

    "abstract": "A deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying insecticide resistance is needed to mitigate its threat to malaria vector control. Building upon our earlier identified associations between mosquito microbiota and insecticide resistance, we demonstrate for the first time, type-specific effects of pyrethroid exposure on internal and cuticle surface bacteria in adult progeny of field-collected Anopheles albimanus. In contrast, larval cuticle surface--but not internal--bacteria were affected by pyrethroid exposure. Being over five-folds more abundant in pyrethroid resistant adults, as compared to susceptible or non-insecticide-exposed mosquitoes, Klebsiella (alphacypermethrin), Pantoea and Asaia (permethrin) were identified as potential markers of pyrethroid resistance in An. albimanus. We also show for the first time that An. albimanus larvae and adult cuticles harbor more diverse bacterial communities than their internal microbial niches. Our findings indicate insecticide selection pressures on mosquito microbiota, and support the hypothesis of an undescribed microbe-mediated mechanism of insecticide metabolism in mosquitoes.",

    "abstract": "MotivationBiologists commonly store data in tabular form with observations as rows, attributes as columns, and measurements as values. Due to advances in high-throughput technologies, the sizes of tabular datasets are increasing. Some datasets contain millions of rows or columns. To work effectively with such data, researchers must be able to efficiently extract subsets of the data (using filters to select specific rows and retrieving specific columns). However, existing methodologies for querying tabular data do not scale adequately to large datasets or require specialized tools for processing. We sought a methodology that would overcome these challenges and that could be applied to an existing, text-based format.\n\nResultsIn a systematic benchmark, we tested 10 techniques for querying simulated, tabular datasets. These techniques included a delimiter-splitting method, the Python pandas module, regular expressions, object serialization, the awk utility, and string-based indexing. We found that storing the data in fixed-width formats provided excellent performance for extracting data subsets. Because columns have the same width on every row, we could pre-calculate column and row coordinates and quickly extract relevant data from the files. Memory mapping led to additional performance gains. A limitation of fixed-width files is the increased storage requirement of buffer characters. Compression algorithms help to mitigate this limitation at a cost of reduced query speeds. Lastly, we used this methodology to transpose tabular files that were hundreds of gigabytes in size, without creating temporary files. We propose coordinate-based, fixed-width storage as a fast, scalable methodology for querying tabular biological data.\n\nContactstephen_piccolo@byu.edu",

    "abstract": "PurposeMelanocortin receptor 1 is overexpressed in melanoma and may be a molecular target for imaging and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy. 68Gallium labeling of DOTA-conjugated peptides is an established procedure in the clinic for use in positron emission tomography imaging. Aim of this study was to compare a standard labeling protocol against the 68Ga-DOTA peptide purified from the excess of unlabeled peptide.\n\nProceduresThe MC1R ligand DOTA-NAPamide was labeled with 68Ga using a standard clinical protocol. Radioactive peptide was separated from the excess of unlabeled DOTA-NAPamide by HPLC. Immediately after the incubation of peptide and 68Ga (95 {degrees}C, 15 min), the reaction was loaded on a C18 column and separated by a water/acetonitrile gradient, allowing fractionation in less than 20 minutes. Radiolabeled products were compared in biodistribution studies and PET imaging using nude mice bearing MC1R-expressing B16/F1 xenograft tumors.\n\nResultsIn biodistribution studies, the non-purified 68Ga-DOTA-NAPamide did not show significant uptake in the tumor at 1 h post injection (0.78% IA/g). By the additional HPLC step, the molar activity was raised around 10,000-fold by completely removing unlabeled peptide. Application of this rapid purification strategy led to a more than 8-fold increase in tumor uptake (7.0% IA/g). The addition of various amounts of unlabeled DOTA-NAPamide to the purified product led to a blocking effect and a decreased specific tumor uptake, similar to the result seen with non-purified radiopeptide. PET imaging was performed using the same tracers for biodistribution. Purified 68Ga-DOTA-NAPamide, in comparison, showed superior tumor uptake.\n\nConclusionsWe demonstrated that chromatographic separation of radiolabeled from excess unlabeled peptide is technically feasible and beneficial, even for short-lived isotopes such as 68Ga. Unlabeled peptide molecules compete with receptor binding sites in the target tissue. Purification of the radiopeptide therefore improved tumor uptake.",

    "abstract": "MotivationNormalizing diverse representations of sequence variants is critical to the elucidation of the genetic basis of disease and biological function. NCBI has long wrestled with integrating data from multiple submitters to build databases such as dbSNP and ClinVar. Inconsistent representation of variants among variant callers, local databases, and tools results in discrepancies and duplications that complicate analysis. Current tools are not robust enough to manage variants in different formats and different reference sequence coordinates.\n\nResultsThe SPDI (pronounced \"speedy\") data model defines variants as a sequence of 4 operations: start at the boundary before the first position in the sequence S, advance P positions, delete D positions, then insert the sequence in the string I, giving the data model its name, SPDI. The SPDI model can thus be applied to both nucleotide and protein variants, but the services discussed here are limited to nucleotide. Current services convert representations between HGVS, VCF, and SPDI and provide two forms of normalization. The first, based on the NCBI Variant Overprecision Correction Algorithm, returns a unique, normalized representation termed the \"Contextual Allele\" for any input. The SPDI name, with its four operations, defines exactly the reference subsequence potentially affected by the variant, even in low complexity regions such as homopolymer and dinucleotide sequence repeats. The second level of normalization depends on an alignment dataset (ADS). SPDI services perform remapping (AKA lift-over) of variants from the input reference sequence to return a list of all equivalent Contextual Alleles based on the transcript or genomic sequences that were aligned. One of these contextual alleles is selected to represent all, usually that based on the latest genomic assembly such as GRCh38 and is designated as the unique \"Canonical Allele\". ADS includes alignments between non-assembly RefSeq sequences (prefixed NM, NR, NG), as well inter- and intra-assembly-associated genomic sequences (NCs, NTs and NWs) and this allow for robust remapping and normalization of variants across sequences and assembly versions.\n\nAvailability and implementationThe SPDI services are available for open access at: https://api.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/variation/v0/\n\nContactholmesbr@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov",

    "abstract": "Batch cultures are a low maintenance and routine culturing method used in anaerobic microbiology. Automated tools that measure growth curves from anaerobic microorganisms grown in traditional laboratory glassware, such as Balch-type tubes, are not commercially available. Here we present a new MicrobiAl Growth Intervalometer (MAGI) that captures microbial growth curves through photo conductivity of the medium using a diffused light pattern of specified frequency, rather than photo-attenuation of collimated light used in traditional systems, and is configured with an offset photodetector/emitter to minimize direct impingement of light from the source to improve the resolution of the solutions density. MAGI is operated by software-driven automation and offers investigators a low noise/high gain instrument with capabilities for remote visualization and data acquisition. MAGI is a low maintenance, low cost, and robust platform primarily for anaerobic cultivation and growth monitoring. We demonstrate the utility of this device by first showing that growth rates and generation times in Escherichia coli K-12 are reproducible to previously published results. We then tested MAGI to measure growth curves of an environmental organism, Intrasporangium calvum, under various media compositions. Our results demonstrate that MAGI is a versatile platform to measure growth curves in media under various redox conditions (microaerobic and anaerobic), complex mediums such as Luria-Bertani (LB) broth and minimal media, and for resolving diauxic growth curves when I. calvum is grown on a disaccharide. Lastly, we demonstrate that the device can resolve growth curves for M concentrations of resources that yield low biomass. This research advances the tools available to microbiologist aiming to monitor growth curves in a variety of disciplines, such as environmental microbiology, clinical microbiology, and food sciences.",

    "abstract": "Human adipose tissue depots perform numerous diverse physiological functions, and are differentially linked to metabolic disease risk, yet only two major human adipocyte subtypes have been described, white and \"brown/brite/beige.\" The diversity and lineages of adipocyte classes have been studied in mice using genetic methods that cannot be applied in humans. Here we circumvent this problem by studying the fate of single mesenchymal progenitor cells obtained from human adipose tissue. We report that a minimum of four human adipocyte subtypes can be distinguished by transcriptomic analysis, specialized for functionally distinct processes such as adipokine secretion and thermogenesis. Evidence for the presence of these adipocytes subtypes in adult humans is evidenced by differential expression of key adipokines leptin and adiponectin in isolated mature adipocytes. The human adipocytes most similar to the mouse \"brite/beige\" adipocytes are enriched in mechanisms that promote iron accumulation and protect from oxidative stress, and are derived from progenitors that express high levels of cytokines such as IL1B, IL8, IL11 and the IL6 family cytokine LIF, and low levels of the transcriptional repressors ID1 and ID3. Our finding of this adipocyte repertoire and its developmental mechanisms provides a high-resolution framework to analyze human adipose tissue architecture and its role in systemic metabolism and metabolic disease.",

    "abstract": "To bypass DNA damage, cells have Y-Family DNA polymerases (DNAPs). One Y-Family-class includes DNAP {kappa} and DNAP IV, which accurately insert dCTP opposite N2-dG adducts, including from the carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene (BP). Another class includes DNAP {eta} and DNAP V, which insert accurately opposite UV-damage, but inaccurately opposite BP-N2-dG. To investigate structural differences between Y-Family-classes, Dpo4 (a canonical {eta}/V-class-member) is modified to make it more {kappa}/IV-like, as evaluated via primer-extension studies with a BP-N2-dG-containing template. Three protein structural elements are identified that promote fidelity. (1) Watson-Crick-like [dCTP:BP-N2-dG] pairing requires the BP-moiety to be in the minor groove. Thus, as expected, dCTP insertion is facilitated by having large openings in the protein surface that can accommodate BP-bulk in the minor groove. The BP-moiety is also in the minor groove during dATP and dTTP misinsertion, though evidence suggests that each of these three minor groove BP-conformations differ. (2) Plugging an opening on the major groove side of the protein suppresses dGTP misinsertion, implying BP-N2-dG bulk is in the major groove during Hoogsteen syn-adduct-dG:dGTP pairing. (3) Y-Family DNAPs have non-covalent bridges (NCBs) holding their little finger-domain in contact with their catalytic core-domain; dATP/dGTP/dTTP misinsertions are suppressed by the quantity and quality of NCBs, including one near and another distal to the active site on the minor groove side. In conclusion, three protein structural elements enhance dCTP and/or suppress dATP/dGTP/dTTP insertion; four different BP-adduct conformations are responsible for the four different dNTP insertional pathways opposite BP-N2-dG; generalizations about Y-Family structure are also considered.",

    "abstract": "The genomic revolution opened up the possibility for predicting un-tested phenotypes in schemes commonly referred as genomic selection (GS). Considering the practicality of applying GS in the line development stage of a hard red winter (HRW) wheat variety development program (VDP), effectiveness of GS was evaluated by prediction accuracy, as well as by the response to selection across field seasons that demonstrated challenges for crop improvement under significant climate variability. Important breeding targets for HRW wheat improvement in the southern Great Plains of USA, including Grain Yield, Kernel Weight, Wheat Protein content, and Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) Sedimentation Volume as a rapid test for predicting bread-making quality, were used to estimate GSs effectiveness across harvest years from 2014 (drought) to 2016 (normal). In general, nonparametric algorithms RKHS and RF produced higher accuracies in both same-year/environment cross validations and cross-year/environment predictions, for the purpose of line selection in this bi-parental doubled haploid (DH) population. Further, the stability of GS performance was greatest for SDS Sedimentation Volume but least for Wheat Protein content. To ensure long-term genetic gain, our study on selection response suggested that across this sample of environmental variability, and though there are cases where phenotypic selection (PS) might be still preferential, training conducted under drought stress or in suboptimal conditions could still provide an encouraging prediction outcome, when selection decisions were made in normal conditions. However, it is not advisable to use training information collected from a normal field season to predict trait performance under drought conditions.

In contrast to previous widespread correlations between plasmid acquisition and resistance to antimicrobial compounds, we demonstrate that acquisition of the P. syringae megaplasmid pMPPla107 sensitizes strains to a conserved, bacteriostatic small molecule produced by many Pseudomonas spp. Moreover, we find the acquisition of pMPPla107 reduces production of the inhibitory agent.
