    "abstract": "In the healthy human brain, the processing of spoken words is strongly left-lateralised, while the processing of complex non-linguistic sounds recruits brain regions bilaterally. Here we asked whether the left anterior temporal lobe, strongly implicated in semantic processing, is critical to this special treatment of linguistic stimuli. Nine patients with semantic dementia (SD) and fourteen age-matched controls underwent magnetoencephalography and structural MRI. Voxel based morphometry demonstrated the stereotypical pattern of SD: severe grey matter loss restricted to the left anterior temporal lobe. During magnetoencephalography, participants listened to word sets in which identity and meaning were ambiguous until utterance completion, for example played vs plate. Whereas left-hemispheric responses were similar across groups, patients demonstrated increased right hemisphere activity 174-294ms after stimulus disambiguation. Source reconstructions confirmed recruitment of right-sided analogues of language regions in SD: atrophy of left anterior temporal lobe was associated with increased activity in right temporal pole, middle temporal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus and supramarginal gyrus. Moreover only healthy controls had differential responses to words versus non-words in right auditory cortex and planum temporale. Overall, the results indicate that anterior temporal lobe is necessary for normal and efficient processing of word identity in the rest of the language network.",

    "abstract": "Multi-photon calcium imaging (CaI) is an important tool to assess activity among neural populations within a column in the sensory cortex. However, the complex asymmetrical interactions among neural populations, termed effective connectivity, cannot be directly assessed by measuring the activity of each neuron using CaI but calls for computational modeling. To estimate effective connectivity among neural populations, we proposed a dynamic causal model (DCM) for CaI by combining a convolution-based dynamic neural state model and a dynamic calcium ion concentration model for CaI signals. After conducting a simulation study to evaluate DCM for CaI, we applied it to an experimental CaI data measured at the layer 2/3 of a barrel cortical column that differentially responds to hit and error whisking trails in mice. We first identified neural populations and constructed computational models with intrinsic connectivity of neural populations within the layer 2/3 of the barrel cortex and extrinsic connectivity with latent external modes. Bayesian model inversion and comparison shows that a top-down model with latent inhibitory and excitatory external modes explains the observed CaI signals during hit and error trials better than any other model, with a single external mode or without any latent modes. The best model also showed differential intrinsic and extrinsic effective connectivity between hit and error trials (corresponding to the bottom-up and top-down processes) in the functional hierarchical architecture. Both simulation and experimental results suggest the usefulness of DCM for CaI in terms of exploration of the hierarchical interactions among neural populations observed in CaI.",

    "abstract": "RNA polymerase II elongation complexes (ECs) were assembled from nuclear extract on immobilized DNA templates and analyzed by quantitative mass spectrometry. Time course experiments showed that initiation factor TFIIF can remain bound to early ECs, while levels of core elongation factors Spt4-Spt5, Paf1C, Spt6-Spn1, and Elf1 levels remain steady. Importantly, the dynamic phosphorylation patterns of the Rpb1 C-terminal domain (CTD), and the factors that recognize them, change as a function of post-initiation time, rather than distance elongated. Chemical inhibition of Kin28/Cdk7 blocks both Serine 5 and Serine 2 phosphorylation, affects initiation site choice, and inhibits elongation efficiency. EC components dependent on CTD phosphorylation include capping enzyme, Cap Binding Complex, Set2, and the PAF1 complex. By recapitulating many known features of in vivo elongation, this system reveals new details that clarify how EC-associated core elongation factors, chromatin regulators, and RNA processing factors change at each step of transcription.",

    "abstract": "The early mammalian embryo (blastocyst) contains three co-developing types of stem cells. Two supporting extraembryonic types - the trophectoderm and the primitive endoderm - encase and guide the pluripotent epiblast that eventually forms all body tissues. Unlike embryos, stem cell-based models of the embryo can be generated in large numbers and subjected to high-content screens as a basis for basic and biomedical discoveries (Rivron et al., 2018a; Vrij et al., 2016b). Here, we show that aggregates of naive Embryonic stem cells cultured in chemically-defined conditions and exposed to combinatorial screens of signaling molecules, rapidly (48 hours) and efficiently (80%) set apart PrE-like cells. These cells produce a basal lamina, generate progenitors resembling both visceral and parietal endoderm, and polarize co-developing Epiblast cells to form a proamniotic cavity. In blastoids, stem cell-based models of the early blastocyst (Rivron et al., 2018b), this combination of signals increases the ratio and number of Gata6+/Nanog+ cells and promotes the survival, growth and morphogenesis of a post-implantation-like Epiblast in vitro. Modeling early embryonic development in chemically-defined in vitro conditions shows that the primitive endoderm forms via a specific combination of signaling pathways and sufficient to drive the development of the Epiblast.",

    "abstract": "More than just a container for DNA, the nucleus carries out a wide variety of critical and highly regulated cellular functions. One of these functions is nuclear import, and in this study we investigate how altering nuclear import impacts developmental progression and organismal size. During early Xenopus laevis embryogenesis, the timing of a key developmental event, the midblastula transition (MBT), is sensitive to nuclear import factor levels. How might altering nuclear import and MBT timing in the early embryo affect downstream development of the organism? We microinjected X.laevis two-cell embryos to increase levels of importin  or NTF2, resulting in differential amounts of nuclear import factors in the two halves of the embryo. Compared to controls, these embryos exhibited delayed gastrulation, curved neural plates, and bent tadpoles with different sized eyes. Furthermore, embryos microinjected with NTF2 developed into smaller froglets compared to control microinjected embryos. We propose that altering nuclear import and size affects MBT timing, cell size, and cell number, subsequently disrupting later development. Thus, altering nuclear import early in development can affect function and size at the organismal level.",

    "abstract": "Traditional neurobiological theories of musical emotions explain well why extreme music such as punk, hardcore or metal, whose vocal and instrumental characteristics share much similarity with acoustic threat signals, should evoke unpleasant feelings for a large proportion of listeners. Why it doesnt for metal music fans, however, remains a theoretical challenge: metal fans may differ from non-fans in how they process acoustic threat signals at the sub-cortical level, showing deactivated or reconditioned responses that differ from controls. Alternatively, it is also possible that appreciation for metal depends on the inhibition by cortical circuits of a normal low-order response to auditory threat. In a series of three experiments, we show here that, at a sensory level, metal fans actually react equally negatively, equally fast and even more accurately to cues of auditory threat in vocal and instrumental contexts than non-fans. Conversely, cognitive load somewhat appears to reduce fans appreciation of metal to the level reported by non-fans. Taken together, these results are not compatible with the idea that extreme music lovers do so because of a different low-level response to threat, but rather, highlight a critical contribution of higher-order cognition to the aesthetic experience. These results are discussed in the light of recent higher-order theories of emotional consciousness, which we argue should be generalized to the emotional experience of music across musical genres.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCancer is one of the most complex phenomena in biology and medicine. Extensive attempts have been made to work around this complexity. In this study, we try to take a selective approach; not modeling each particular facet in detail but rather only the pertinent and essential parts of the tumor system are simulated and followed by optimization, revealing specific traits. This leads us to a pellucid personalized model which is noteworthy as it closely approximates existing experimental results.\\n\\nMethodFor years, research has focused on modeling tumor growth but not many studies have put forward a framework for the personalization of models. In the present study, a hybrid modeling approach which consists of cellular automata for discrete cell state representation and diffusion equations to calculate distribution of relevant substances in the tumor micro-environment is favored. Moreover, naive Bayesian decision making with weighted stochastic equations and a Bayesian network to model the temporal order of mutations is presented. The model is personalized according to the evidence using Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Ultimately, this way of thinking about tumor modeling leads us to a vascular multi-scale model of tumor growth.\\n\\nResultsTo validate the tumor model, a data set belonging to the A549 cell line is used. The data represents the growth of a tumor for 30 days. We optimize the coefficients of the stochastic decision making equations using first half of the timeline. Then we predict next 15 days of growth without any other supervision. Results are promising with their low error margin and simulated growth data is in line with laboratory results.\\n\\nConclusionThere are many subsystems which have an effect in the growth of a tumor. A detailed model which includes all of them is currently virtually impossible to implement. We have therefore focused on a system that only includes fundamental components in this study, and have evaluated its predictions. We propose novel probability functions to obtain a personalized model and estimate the individual importance (weights) of each with parameter optimization. Our approach of using simulated annealing for parameter estimation and the subsequent validation of the prediction with in-vitro tumor growth data are, to our knowledge, unique in the literature.",

    "abstract": "The de novo emergence of new transcripts has been well documented through genomic analyses. However, a functional analysis, especially of very young protein-coding genes, is still largely lacking. Here we focus on three loci that have evolved from previously intergenic sequences in the house mouse (Mus musculus) and are not present in its closest relatives. We have obtained knockouts and analyzed their phenotypes, including a deep transcriptomic analysis, based on a dedicated power analysis. We show that the transcriptional networks are significantly disturbed in the knockouts and that all three genes have effects on phenotypes that are related to their expression patterns. This includes behavioral effects, skeletal differences and the regulation of the reproduction cycle in females. Substitution analysis suggests that all three genes have directly obtained an activity, without new adaptive substitutions. Our findings support the hypothesis that de novo genes can quickly adopt functions without extensive adaptation.\\n\\nImpact statementNew protein-coding genes emerging out of non-coding sequences can become directly functional without signatures of adaptive protein changes",
