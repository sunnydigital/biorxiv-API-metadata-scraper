    "abstract": "At any given moment, we experience a perceptual scene as a single whole and yet we may distinguish a variety of objects within it. This phenomenon instantiates two properties of conscious perception: integration and differentiation. Integration to experience a collection of objects as a unitary percept, and differentiation to experience these objects as distinct from each other. Here we evaluated the neural information dynamics underlying integration and differentiation of perceptual contents during bistable perception. Participants listened to a sequence of tones (auditory bistable stimuli) experienced either as a single stream (perceptual integration) or as two parallel streams (perceptual differentiation) of sounds. We computed neurophysiological indices of information integration and information differentiation with electroencephalographic and intracranial recordings. When perceptual alternations were endogenously driven, the integrated percept was associated with an increase in neural information-integration and a decrease in neural differentiation across frontoparietal regions, whereas the opposite pattern was observed for the differentiated percept. However, when perception was exogenously driven by a change in the sound stream (no bistability) neural oscillatory power distinguished between percepts but information measures did not. We demonstrate that perceptual integration and differentiation can be mapped to theoretically-motivated neural information signatures, suggesting a direct relationship between phenomenology and neurophysiology.",

    "abstract": "The 3 untranslated regions (3UTRs) of messenger RNAs (mRNA) are non-coding sequences that regulate several aspects of mRNA metabolism, including intracellular localisation and translation. Here, we show that in sympathetic neuron axons, the 3UTRs of many transcripts undergo cleavage, generating both translatable isoforms expressing a shorter 3UTR, and 3UTR fragments. 3end RNA sequencing indicated that 3UTR cleavage is a potentially widespread event in axons, which is mediated by a protein complex containing the endonuclease Ago2 and the RNA binding protein HuD. Analysis of the Inositol monophosphatase 1 (Impa1) mRNA revealed that a stem loop structure within the 3UTR is necessary for Ago2 cleavage. Thus, remodeling of the 3UTR provides an alternative mechanism that simultaneously regulates local protein synthesis and generates a new class of 3UTR RNAs with yet unknown functions.",

    "abstract": "Manipulating the dynamics of neural systems through targeted stimulation is a frontier of research and clinical neuroscience; however, the control schemes considered for neural systems are mismatched for the unique needs of manipulating neural dynamics. An appropriate control method should respect the variability in neural systems, incorporating moment to moment \\\"input\\\" to the neural dynamics and behaving based on the current neural state, irrespective of the past trajectory. We propose such a controller under a nonlinear state-space feedback framework that steers one dynamical system to function as through it were another dynamical system entirely. This \\\"myopic\\\" controller is formulated through a novel variant of a model reference control cost that manipulates dynamics in a short-sighted manner that only sets a target trajectory of a single time step into the future (hence its myopic nature), which omits the need to pre-calculate a rigid and computationally costly neural feedback control solution. To demonstrate the breadth of this controls utility, two examples with distinctly different applications in neuroscience are studied. First, we show the myopic controls utility to probe the causal link between dynamics and behavior for cognitive processes by transforming a winner-take-all decision-making system to operate as a robust neural integrator of evidence. Second, an unhealthy motor-like system containing an unwanted beta-oscillation spiral attractor is controlled to function as a healthy motor system, a relevant clinical example for neurological disorders.",

    "abstract": "In the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, genomic DNA associates with numerous protein complexes and RNAs, forming the chromatin landscape. Through a genome-wide study of chromatin-associated proteins in Drosophila cells, five major chromatin types were identified as a refinement of the traditional binary division into hetero- and euchromatin. These five types are defined by distinct but overlapping combinations of proteins and differ in biological and biochemical properties, including transcriptional activity, replication timing and histone modifications. In this work, we assess the evolutionary relationships of chromatin-associated proteins and present an integrated view of the evolution and conservation of the fruit fly D. melanogaster chromatin landscape. We combine homology prediction across a wide range of species with gene age inference methods to determine the origin of each chromatin-associated protein. This provides insight into the emergence of the different chromatin types. Our results indicate that the two euchromatic types, YELLOW and RED, were one single activating type that split early in eukaryotic history. Next, we provide evidence that GREEN-associated proteins are involved in a centromere drive and expanded in a lineage-specific way in D. melanogaster. Our results on BLUE chromatin support the hypothesis that the emergence of Polycomb Group proteins is linked to eukaryotic multicellularity. In light of these results, we discuss how the regulatory complexification of chromatin links to the origins of eukaryotic multicellularity.",

    "abstract": "The self-renewal of intestinal stem cell is controlled by Wingless/Wnt-{beta} catenin signaling both in Drosophila and mammals. Since Axin is a rate-limiting factor in Wingless signaling its regulation is essential. Iduna is an evolutionarily conserved ubiquitin E3 ligase that has been identified as a critical regulator for degradation of ADP-ribosylated Axin and thus of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling. However, its physiological significance remains to be demonstrated. Here, we generated loss-of-function mutants of Iduna to investigate its physiological role in Drosophila. Genetic depletion of Iduna causes the accumulation of both Tankyrase and Axin. Increase of Axin protein in enterocytes non-autonomously enhanced stem cell divisions in the Drosophila midgut. Enterocytes secreted Unpaired and thereby stimulated the activity of the JAK-STAT pathway in intestinal stem cells. A decrease in Axin gene expression suppressed both the over-proliferation of stem cells and restored their numbers to normal levels in Iduna mutants. These findings suggest that Iduna-mediated regulation of Axin proteolysis is essential to maintain tissue homeostasis in the Drosophila midgut.",

    "abstract": "The CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) regions of the hippocampus are considered key for disambiguating sensory inputs from similar experiences in memory, a process termed pattern separation. The neural mechanisms underlying pattern separation, however, have been difficult to compare across species: rodents offer robust recording methods with less human-centric tasks while humans provide complex behavior with less recording potential. To overcome these limitations, we trained monkeys to perform a visual pattern separation task similar to those used in humans while recording activity from single CA3/DG neurons. We find that when animals discriminate recently seen novel images from similar (lure) images, behavior indicative of pattern separation, CA3/DG neurons respond to lure images more like novel than repeat images. Using a population of these neurons, we are able to classify novel, lure, and repeat images from each other using this pattern of firing rates. Notably, one subpopulation of these neurons is more responsible for distinguishing lures and repeats--the key discrimination indicative of pattern separation.",

    "abstract": "Networks of co-expressed genes produce complex phenotypes associated with functional novelty. Sex differences in gene expression levels or in the structure of gene co-expression networks can cause sexual dimorphism and may resolve sexually antagonistic selection. Here we used RNA-sequencing in the paleopolyploid salmonid Brook Charr Salvelinus fontinalis to characterize sex-specific co-expression networks in the liver of 35 female and 51 male offspring. In both networks, modules were characterized for functional enrichment, hub gene identification, and associations with 15 growth, reproduction, and stress-related phenotypes. Modules were then evaluated for preservation in the opposite sex, and in the congener Arctic Charr Salvelinus alpinus. Overall, more transcripts were assigned to a module in the female network than in the male network, which coincided with higher inter-individual gene expression and phenotype variation in the females. Most modules were preserved between sexes and species, including those involved in conserved cellular processes (e.g. translation, immune pathways). However, two sex-specific male modules were identified, and these may contribute to sexual dimorphism. To compare with the network analysis, differentially expressed transcripts were identified between the sexes, finding a total of 16% of expressed transcripts as sex-biased. For both sexes, there was no overrepresentation of sex-biased genes or sex-specific modules on the putative sex chromosome. Sex-biased transcripts were also not overrepresented in sex-specific modules, and in fact highly male-biased transcripts were enriched in preserved modules. Comparative network analysis and differential expression analyses identified different aspects of sex differences in gene expression, and both provided new insights on the genes underlying sexual dimorphism in the salmonid Brook Charr.",

    "abstract": "Emerging RNA-based approaches to disease detection and gene therapy require RNA sequences that fold into specific base-pairing patterns, but computational algorithms generally remain inadequate for these secondary structure design tasks. The Eterna project has crowdsourced RNA design to human video game players in the form of puzzles that reach extraordinary difficulty. Here, we present an eternamoves-large repository consisting of 1.8 million of player moves on 12 of the most-played Eterna puzzles as well as an eternamoves-select repository of 30,477 moves from the top 72 players on a select set of more advanced puzzles. On eternamoves-select, a multilayer convolutional neural network (CNN) EternaBrain achieves test accuracies of 51% and 34% in base prediction and location prediction, respectively, suggesting that top players moves are partially stereotyped. We then show that while this CNNs move predictions are not enough to solve numerous new puzzles, inclusion of six additional strategies compiled by human players solves 61 out of 100 independent puzzles in the Eterna100 benchmark. This EternaBrain-SAP performance is better than previously published methods and in the middle of the performance range of newer algorithms developed by Eterna participants and other groups.

    "abstract": "Protein tyrosine nitration is a hallmark of oxidative stress related disease states, commonly detected as anti-nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity. The precise reactive oxygen sources, mechanisms of nitration as well as the modified target proteins and functional consequences, however, remain often unclear. Here we explore protein tyrosine nitration under basal conditions and find surprisingly physiologically nitrated proteins. Upon purifying a prominent physiologically nitrotyrosine immunopositive in hearts from mouse, rat and pig, we identify it as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Mechanistically, LDHs degree of basal nitration depended on two canonical sources, NO synthase (NOS) and myeloperoxidase (MPO), respectively. When validating the nitrated amino acid by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, we, surprisingly, located LDH nitration not to a tyrosine but the C-terminal tryptophan, Trp324. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that Trp324 nitration restricts the interaction of the active site loop with the C-terminal -helix essential for activity. This prediction was confirmed by enzyme kinetics revealing an apparent lower Vmax of nitrated LDH, although yet unidentified concurrent oxidative modifications may contribute. Protein nitration is, thus, not a by definition disease marker but reflects also physiological signaling by eNOS/NO, MPO/nitrite and possibly other pathways. The commonly used assay of anti-nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity is apparently cross-reactive to nitrotryptophan requiring a reevaluation of the protein nitration literature. In the case of LDH, nitration of Trp324 is aggravated under cardiac metabolic stress conditions and functionally limits maximal enzyme activity. Trp324-nitrated LDH may serve both as a previously not recognized disease biomarker and possibly mechanistic lead to understand the metabolic changes under these conditions.",

    "abstract": "Robot-assisted training is a promising tool under development for improving walking function based on repetitive goal-oriented task practice. The challenges in developing the controllers for gait training devices that promote desired changes in gait is complicated by the limited understanding of the human response to robotic input. A possible method of controller formulation can be based on the principle of bio-inspiration, where a robot is controlled to apply the change in joint moment applied by human subjects when they achieve a gait feature of interest. However, it is currently unclear how lower extremity joint moments are modulated by even basic gaitspatio-temporal parameters.\\n\\nIn this study, we investigated how sagittal plane joint moments are affected by a factorial modulation of two important gait parameters: gait speed and stride length. We present the findings obtained from 20 healthy control subjects walking at various treadmill-imposed speeds and instructed to modulate stride length utilizing real-time visual feedback. Implementing a continuum analysis of inverse-dynamics derived joint moment profiles, we extracted the effects of gait speed and stride length on joint moment throughout the gait cycle. Moreover, we utilized a torque pulse approximation analysis to determine the timing and amplitude of torque pulses that approximate the difference in joint moment profiles between stride length conditions, at all gait speed conditions.\\n\\nOur results show that gait speed has a significant effect on the moment profiles in all joints considered, while stride length has more localized effects, with the main effect observed on the knee moment during stance, and smaller effects observed for the hip joint moment during swing and ankle moment during the loading response. Moreover, our study demonstrated that trailing limb angle, a parameter of interest in programs targeting propulsion at push-off, was significantly correlated with stride length. As such, our study has generated assistance strategies based on pulses of torque suitable for implementation via a wearable exoskeleton with the objective of modulating stride length, and other correlated variables such as trailing limb angle.",

Neurons utilize microtubule-dependent molecular motors to allocate proteasomes to synapses, but how proteasomes are coupled to motor proteins and how this transport is regulated to meet changing demand for protein breakdown remains largely unknown. We show that the conserved proteasome-binding protein PI31 serves as an adaptor to directly couple proteasomes with dynein light chain proteins (DYNLL1/2). Inactivation of PI31 inhibits proteasome motility in axons and disrupts synaptic protein homeostasis, structure and function. Moreover, phosphorylation of PI31 at a conserved site by p38 MAP kinase promotes binding to DYNLL1/2, and a non-phosphorable PI31 mutant impairs proteasome movement in axons, suggesting a mechanism to regulate loading of proteasomes onto motor proteins. Because mutations affecting PI31 activity are associated with human neurodegenerative diseases, impairment of PI31-mediated axonal transport of proteasomes may be the root cause of these disorders.",

    "abstract": "Mathematical models have been used successfully at diverse scales of biological organization, ranging from ecology and population dynamics to stochastic reaction events occurring between individual molecules in single cells. Generally, many biological processes unfold across multiple scales, with mutations being the best studied example of how stochasticity at the molecular scale can influence outcomes at the population scale. In many other contexts, however, an analogous link between micro- and macro-scale remains elusive, primarily due to the challenges involved in setting up and analyzing multi-scale models. Here, we employ such a model to investigate how stochasticity propagates from individual biochemical reaction events in the bacterial innate immune system to the ecology of bacteria and bacterial viruses. We show analytically how the dynamics of bacterial populations are shaped by the activities of immunity-conferring enzymes in single cells and how the ecological consequences imply optimal bacterial defense strategies against viruses. Our results suggest that bacterial populations in the presence of viruses can either optimize their initial growth rate or their steady state population size, with the first strategy favoring simple and the second strategy favoring complex bacterial innate immunity.",

    "abstract": "Decoding laminar information across deep brain structures and cortical regions is necessary in order to understand the spatiotemporal ensembles that represent cognition and memory. Large animal models are essential for translational research due to their gyrencephalic neuroanatomy and significant white matter composition. One of the major obstacles to applying the approaches currently utilized in lower order animals are technical limitations in silicon probes, specifically a lack of long-length probes with appropriate stiffness to penetrate to deeper structures with minimal damage to the neural interface. We tested various solutions and designs of multichannel silicon probes developed for large animal electrophysiology by recording neurophysiological signals from deep laminar structures in an acute preparation and in chronically implanted awake behaving Yucatan pigs. Electrophysiological parameters of single units and local field potentials were analyzed to evaluate performance over time of given silicon probes in chronic implantations. The cross-sectional area of silicon probes was found to be a crucial determinant of silicon probes single unit performance over time, potentially due to reduction of damage to the neural interface. EDGE-style probes had the highest yields during intra-hippocampal recordings in pigs, making them the most suitable for chronic implantations and awake behavioral experimentation. Novel CAMB 64-channel EDGE-style probes with linear and poly-2 site arrangement tested acutely had optimal single unit separation and a denser sampling of the laminar structure, identifying them as potential candidates for chronic implantations with less cortical damage above the active portion of the probe. This study provides an analysis of multichannel silicon probes designed for large animal laminar electrophysiology of deep brain structures, and suggests that current designs are reaching the physical thresholds necessary for long-term (~ 1 month) recordings from laminar deep structures with single-unit resolution.",

    "abstract": "Processing bodies (PBs) are cytoplasmic mRNP granules that assemble via liquid-liquid phase separation and are implicated in the decay or storage of mRNAs. How PB assembly is regulated in cells remains unclear. We recently identified the ATPase activity of the DEAD-box protein Dhh1 as a key regulator of PB dynamics and demonstrated that Not1, an activator of the Dhh1 ATPase and member of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex inhibits PB assembly in vivo [Mugler et al., 2016]. Here, we show that the PB component Pat1 antagonizes Not1 and promotes PB assembly via its direct interaction with Dhh1. Intriguingly, in vivo PB dynamics can be recapitulated in vitro, since Pat1 enhances the phase separation of Dhh1 and RNA into liquid droplets, whereas Not1 reverses Pat1-Dhh1-RNA condensation. Overall, our results uncover a function of Pat1 in promoting the multimerization of Dhh1 on mRNA, thereby aiding the assembly of large multivalent mRNP granules that are PBs.",

    "abstract": "The \"neural correlates of consciousness\" (NCC) is a familiar topic in neuroscience, overlapping with research on the brains \"default mode network\". Task-based studies of NCC by their nature recruit one part of the cortical network to study another, and are therefore both limited and compromised in what they can reveal about consciousness itself. The form of consciousness explored in such research, we term the human default consciousness (DCs), our everyday waking consciousness. In contrast, studies of anaesthesia, coma, deep sleep, or some extreme pathological states such as epilepsy, reveal very different cortical activity; all of which states are essentially involuntary, and generally regarded as \"unconscious\". An exception to involuntary disruption of consciousness is Buddhist jh[a]na meditation, whose implicit aim is to intentionally withdraw from the default consciousness, to an inward-directed state of stillness referred to as jh[a]na consciousness, as a basis to develop insight. The default consciousness is sensorily-based, where information about, and our experience of, the outer world is evaluated against personal and organic needs and forms the basis of our ongoing self-experience. This view conforms both to Buddhist models, and to the emerging work on active inference and minimisation of free energy in determining the network balance of the human default consciousness.\n\nThis paper is a preliminary report on the first detailed EEG study of jh[a]na meditation, with findings radically different to studies of more familiar, less focused forms of meditation. While remaining highly alert and \"present\" in their subjective experience, a high proportion of subjects display \"spindle\" activity in their EEG, superficially similar to sleep spindles of stage 2 nREM sleep, while more-experienced subjects display high voltage slow-waves reminiscent, but significantly different, to the slow waves of deeper stage 4 nREM sleep, or even high-voltage delta coma. Some others show brief posterior spike-wave bursts, again similar, but with significant differences, to absence epilepsy. Some subjects also develop the ability to consciously evoke clonic seizure-like activity at will, under full control. We suggest that the remarkable nature of these observations reflects a profound disruption of the human DCs when the personal element is progressively withdrawn.",

    "abstract": "Immunofluorescence staining is the key technique for visualizing organization of endogenous cellular structures in single cells. Labeling and imaging of blood stage Plasmodium falciparum has always been challenging since it is a small intracellular parasite. The gold standard for parasite immunofluorescence is fixation in suspension with addition of minute amounts of glutaraldehyde to the paraformaldehyde-based solution. While this maintains red blood cell integrity, it has been postulated that antigenicity of the parasite proteins was, if at all, only slightly reduced. Here we show the deleterious effect that even these small quantities of glutaraldehyde can have on immunofluorescence staining quality and present an alternative cell seeding protocol that allows fixation with only paraformaldehyde. The highly improved signal intensity and staining efficiency enabled us to carry out RescueSTED nanoscopy on microtubules and nuclear pores and describe their organization in greater detail throughout the blood stage cycle.\\n\\nHighlights- Omitting glutaraldehyde from fixative improves immunofluorescence staining\\n\\n- STED nanoscopy is readily applicable to infected red blood cells\\n\\n- Intranuclear microtubules are nucleated from distinct sites",

Disease outcomes are often defined not only by the main pathogen but are influenced by diverse microbial communities known as the microbiome at sites of infection. Here we present the first use of whole genome sequencing from a portable DNA sequencing device as a method for detection of fungal pathogens from wheat (Triticum aestivum). The data revealed that our method is robust and applicable to the diagnosis of fungal diseases including wheat stripe rust (caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici), septoria tritici blotch (caused by Zymoseptoria tritici) and yellow leaf spot (caused by Pyrenophora tritici repentis). We also identified a bacterial genus Pseudomonas co-present with Puccinia and Zymoseptoria infections but not Pyrenophora infections. One limitation of the method is the over-representation of redundant wheat genome sequences in the sample. This could be addressed by amplicon-based sequencing approaches in future studies. Our work outlines a new approach for the detection of a broad range of plant pathogens and associated microbes using a portable sequencer, providing the basis for future development of a system for on-site disease monitoring.",

    "abstract": "The neurobiology of heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are still unclear. Despite extensive efforts, most findings are difficult to reproduce due to high levels of individual variance in phenotypic expression. To quantify individual differences in brain morphometry in ASD, we implemented a novel subject-level, distance-based method on subject-specific attributes. In a large multi-cohort sample, each subject with ASD (n=100; n=84 males; mean age: 11.43 years; mean IQ: 110.58) was strictly matched to a control participant (n=100; n=84 males; mean age: 11.43 years; mean IQ: 110.70). Intrapair Euclidean distance of MRI brain morphometry and symptom severity measures were entered into a regularised machine learning pipeline for feature selection, with rigorous out-of-sample validation and bootstrapped permutation testing. Subject-specific structural morphometry features significantly predicted individual variation in ASD symptom severity (19 cortical thickness features, p=0.01, n=5000 permutations; 10 surface area features, p=0.006, n=5000 permutations). Findings remained robust across subjects and were replicated in validation samples. Identified cortical regions implicate key hubs of the salience and default mode networks as neuroanatomical features of social impairment in ASD. Present results highlight the importance of subject-level markers in ASD, and offer an important step forward in understanding the neurobiology of heterogeneous disorders.",

    "abstract": "An animals survival depends on finding food, and the memory of food and contexts are often linked. Given that the hippocampus is required for spatial and contextual memory, it is reasonable to expect related coding of space and food stimuli in hippocampal neurons. However, relatively little is known about how the hippocampus responds to tastes, the most central sensory property of food. In this study, we examined the taste-evoked responses and spatial firing properties of single units in the dorsal CA1 hippocampal region as male rats received a battery of taste stimuli differing in both chemical composition and palatability within a specific spatial context. We identified a subset of hippocampal neurons that responded to tastes, some of which were place cells. These taste and place responses had a distinct interaction: taste-responsive cells tended to have less spatially specific firing fields, and place cells only responded to tastes delivered inside their place field. Like neurons in the amygdala and lateral hypothalamus, hippocampal neurons discriminated between tastes predominantly on the basis of palatability, with taste-selectivity emerging concurrently with palatability-relatedness; these responses did not reflect movement or arousal. However, hippocampal taste responses emerged several hundred msec later than responses in other parts of the taste system, suggesting that the hippocampus does not influence real-time taste decisions, instead associating the hedonic value of tastes with a particular context. This incorporation of taste responses into existing hippocampal maps could be one way that animals use past experience to locate food sources.\\n\\nSignificance statementFinding food is essential for animals survival, and taste and context memory are often linked. While hippocampal responses to space and contexts have been well characterized, little is known about how the hippocampus responds to tastes. Here, we identified a subset of hippocampal neurons that discriminated between tastes based on palatability. Cells with stronger taste responses typically had weaker spatial responses, and taste responses were confined to place cells firing fields. Hippocampal taste responses emerged later than in other parts of the taste system, suggesting that the hippocampus does not influence taste decisions, but rather, associates the hedonic value of tastes consumed within a particular context.

    "abstract": "The neocortex is capable of anticipating the sensory results of movement but the neural mechanisms are poorly understood. In the entorhinal cortex, grid cells represent the location of an animal in its environment, and this location is updated through movement and path integration. In this paper, we propose that sensory neocortex incorporates movement using grid cell-like neurons that represent the location of sensors on an object. We describe a two-layer neural network model that uses cortical grid cells and path integration to robustly learn and recognize objects through movement and predict sensory stimuli after movement. A layer of cells consisting of several grid cell-like modules represents a location in the reference frame of a specific object. Another layer of cells which processes sensory input receives this location input as context and uses it to encode the sensory input in the objects reference frame. Sensory input causes the network to invoke previously learned locations that are consistent with the input, and motor input causes the network to update those locations. Simulations show that the model can learn hundreds of objects even when object features alone are insufficient for disambiguation. We discuss the relationship of the model to cortical circuitry and suggest that the reciprocal connections between layers 4 and 6 fit the requirements of the model. We propose that the subgranular layers of cortical columns employ grid cell-like mechanisms to represent object specific locations that are updated through movement.",

    "abstract": "Microbial electrosynthesis is an emerging technology with the potential to simultaneously store renewably generated energy, fix carbon dioxide, and produce high-value organic compounds. However, limited understanding of the route of electrons into the cell remains an obstacle to developing a robust microbial electrosynthesis platform. To address this challenge, we engineered an inward electron transfer pathway in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. The pathway uses native Mtr proteins to transfer electrons from an electrode to the inner membrane quinone pool. Subsequently, electrons are transferred from quinones to NAD+ by native NADH dehydrogenases. This reverse functioning of NADH dehydrogenases is thermodynamically unfavorable, therefore we have added a light-driven proton pump (proteorhodopsin) to generate proton-motive force to drive this activity. Finally, we use reduction of acetoin to 2,3-butanediol via a heterologous butanediol dehydrogenase (Bdh) as an electron sink. Bdh is an NADH-dependent enzyme, therefore, observation of acetoin reduction supports our hypothesis that cathodic electrons are transferred to intracellular NAD+. Multiple lines of evidence indicate proper functioning of the engineered electrosynthesis system: electron flux from the cathode is influenced by both light and acetoin availability; and 2,3-butanediol production is highest when both light and a poised electrode are present. Using a hydrogenase-deficient S. oneidensis background strain resulted in a stronger correlation between electron transfer and 2,3-butanediol production, suggesting that hydrogen production is an off-target electron sink in the wild-type background. This system represents a promising genetically engineered microbial electrosynthesis platform and will enable a new focus on synthesis of specific compounds using electrical energy.",

These microclusters then move centripetally and coalesce into the central supramolecular activation cluster of an immune synapse. The mechanisms controlling BCR organization during immune synapse formation, and how this impacts BCR signaling, are not fully understood. We show that this coalescence of BCR microclusters depends on the actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex, which nucleates branched actin networks. Moreover, in murine B cells this dynamic spatial reorganization of BCR microclusters amplifies proximal BCR signaling reactions and enhances the ability of membrane-associated antigens to induce transcriptional responses and proliferation. Our finding that Arp2/3 complex activity is important for B cell responses to spatially-restricted membrane-bound antigens, but not for soluble antigens, highlights a critical role for Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin remodelling in B cell responses to APC-bound antigens.",

Here, we combined single cell profiling, deep-learning, mathematical modelling and in vivo functional studies to explore how hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) division patterns evolve with age. We trained an artificial neural network (ANN) to accurately identify cell types in the hematopoietic hierarchy and predict their age from their gene expression patterns. We then used this ANN to compare daughter cell identities immediately after HSC divisions, and found that HSC self-renewal declines sharply with age. Furthermore, while HSC cell divisions are deterministic and intrinsically-regulated in young and old age, they become stochastic and niche-sensitive in mid-life. Analysis of evolving division patterns indicated that the self-renewal ability an individual HSC depends upon number times it has divided previously. We propose a model of HSC proliferation that accurately predicts the accumulation of HSCs with age, and reconciles the stochastic and instructive views of fate commitment.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveSeveral models have been proposed for the evolution of Alzheimers disease (AD) biomarkers. The aim of this study was to identify changepoints in a range of biomarkers during the preclinical phase of AD.\\n\\nMethodsWe examined nine measures based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cognitive testing, obtained from 306 cognitively normal individuals, a subset of whom subsequently progressed to the symptomatic phase of AD. A changepoint model was used to determine which of the measures had a significant change in slope in relation to clinical symptom onset.\\n\\nResultsAll nine measures had significant changepoints, all of which preceded symptom onset, however the timing of these changepoints varied considerably. A single measure, CSF-tau, had an early changepoint (40 years prior to symptom onset). A group of measures, including the remaining CSF measures (CSF-Abeta and phosphorylated tau) and all cognitive tests had changepoints 10-15 years prior to symptom onset. A second group is formed by medial temporal lobe shape composite measures, with a five-year time difference between the right and left side (respectively nine and three years prior to symptom onset).\\n\\nConclusionsThese findings highlight the long period of time prior to symptom onset during which AD pathology is accumulating in the brain. There are several significant findings, including the early changes in cognition and the laterality of the MRI findings. Additional work is needed to clarify their significance.",

    "abstract": "Post exam item analysis enables teachers to reduce biases on student achievement assessments and improve their way of instruction. Difficulty indices, discrimination power and distracter efficiencies were commonly investigated in item analysis. This research was intended to investigate the difficulty and discrimination indices, distracters efficiency, whole test reliability and construct defects in summative test for freshman common course at Gondar CTE. In this study, 176 exam papers were analyzed in terms of difficulty index, point bi-serial correlation and distracter efficiencies. Internal consistency reliability and construct defects such as meaningless stems, punctuation errors and inconsistencies in option formats were also investigated. Results revealed that the summative test as a whole has moderate difficulty level (0.56 {+/-} 0.20) and good distracter efficiency (85.71% {+/-} 29%). However, the exam was poor in terms of discrimination power (0.16 {+/-} 0.28) and internal consistency reliability (KR-20 = 0.58). Only one item has good discrimination power and one more item excellent in its discrimination. About 41.9% of the items were either too easy or too difficult. Inconsistency in option formats or inappropriate options, punctuation errors and meaningless stems were also observed. Thus, future test development interventions should give due emphasis on item reliability, discrimination coefficient and item construct defects.",

    "abstract": "NOTCH1 is best known as a master regulator of T-cell development with a strong oncogenic potential in developing T-cells. Upon induction of Notch, cells go through major transcriptional reprogramming that involves both activation and repression of gene expression. Although much is known about the transcriptional programs activated by Notch, the identity of the genes silenced downstream of Notch signaling and the mechanisms by which Notch down-regulates their expression remain unclear. Here, we show that upon induction of Notch signaling, ICN1-CSL-MAML1 ternary complex assembles a transcriptional Notch Repressive Complex (NRC) containing NuRD and PRC1. Genome wide analysis revealed set of genes bound and transcriptionally repressed by the NRC. Remarkably, among those genes, we found master regulators of cell differentiation and cell proliferation such as PAX5, master B-cell regulator and the DNA-binding transcriptional repressor MAD4. We propose that Notch possesses a dual role as direct activator and repressor by serving as a platform for the recruitment of co-activators and co-repressors on target genes and that both activities are required for Notch nuclear functions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAberrant DNA methylation is a cancer cell feature that is commonly associated with transcriptional alterations. However, the primary role of this defect in the genome-wide cancer-associated gene deregulation is not clear. Here, we evaluated the relative contribution of DNA methylation-dependent and -independent mechanisms to transcriptional alterations at CpG-island/promoter-associated genes in samples of adult glioma, a widespread type of brain tumor.\n\nResultsExtensive molecular analyses of glioma samples with wild type IDH (IDHwt) and mutated IDH (IDHmut) found DNA hypermethylation only in a minority of genes showing loss or gain of expression. Specifically, in IDHwt samples, more than 75% of aberrantly repressed genes did not display DNA methylation defects at their CpG-island promoter. Conversely, altered H3K27me3 was the predominant molecular defect at deregulated genes. Moreover, the presence of a bivalent chromatin signature at CpG-island promoters in stem cells might not only predispose to hypermethylation, as widely documented, but more generally to all types of transcriptional alterations in transformed cells. In addition, the gene expression strength in healthy brain cells influences the choice between DNA methylation- and H3K27me3-associated silencing in glioma. Our findings support a model whereby the altered control of H3K27me3 dynamics, more specifically defects in the interplay between polycomb protein complexes and the brain-specific transcriptional machinery, is the main cause of transcriptional alteration in glioma cells.\n\nConclusionsOur study provides a comprehensive and updated description of the epigenetic deregulations in glioma that could be useful for the design of drugs to target cancer-related epigenetic defects.",

    "abstract": "Mobile elements generated via DNA transposition constitute [~]50% of the primate genomes. As a result of past and ongoing activity, DNA transposition is responsible for generating inter- and intra-species genomic variations, and it plays important roles in shaping genome evolution and impacting gene function. While limited analysis of mobile elements has been performed in many primate genomes, a large-scale comparative genomic analysis examining the impact of DNA transposition on primate evolution is still missing.\\n\\nUsing a bioinformatics comparative genomics approach, we performed analysis of species-specific mobile elements (SS-MEs) in eight primate genomes, which include human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, green monkey, crab-eating macaque, rhesus monkey, and baboon. These species have good representations for the top two primate families, Hominidae (great apes) and the Cercopithecidae (old world monkeys), for which draft genome sequences are available.\\n\\nOur analysis identified a total of 230,855 SS-MEs from the eight primate genomes, which collectively contribute to [~]82 Mbp genome sequences, ranging from 14 to 25 Mbp for individual genomes. Several new interesting observations were made based on these SS-MEs. First, the DNA transposition activity level reflected by the numbers of SS-MEs was shown to be drastically different across species with the highest (baboon genome) being more than 30 times higher than the lowest (crab-eating macaque genome). Second, the compositions of SS-MEs, as well as the top active ME subfamilies, also differ significantly across genomes. By the copy numbers of SS-MEs divided into major ME classes, SINE represents the dominant class in all genomes, but more so in the Cercopithecidae genomes than in the Hominidae genomes in general with the orangutan genome being the outliner of this trend by having LINE as the dominant class. While AluY represents the major SINE groups in the Hominidae genomes, AluYRa1 is the dominant SINE in the Cercopithecidae genomes. For LINEs, each Hominidae genome seems to have a unique most active L1 subfamily, but all Cercopithecidae genomes have L1RS2 as the most active LINEs. While genomes with a high number of SS-MEs all have one or more very active ME subfamilies, the crab-eating macaque genome, being the one with an extremely low level of DNA transposition, has no single ME class being very active, suggesting the existence of a genome-wide mechanism suppressing DNA transposition. Third, DNA transposons, despite being considered dead in primate genomes, were in fact shown to have a certain level of activity in all genomes examined with a total of [~]2,400 entries as SS-MEs. Among these SS-MEs, at least 23% locate to genic regions, including exons and regulatory elements, presenting significant potentials for their impact on gene function. Very interestingly, our data demonstrate that, among the eight primates included in this study, the human genome is shown to be the most actively evolving genome via DNA transposition as having the highest most recent activity of many ME subfamilies, notably the AluYa5/Yb8/Yb9, L1HS, and SVA-D subfamilies.\\n\\nRepresenting the first of its kind, our large-scale comparative genomics study has shown that mobile elements evolved quite differently among different groups and species of primates, indicating that differential DNA transposition has served as an important mechanism in primate evolution.",

Direct, chemical inhibition of TORC2 arrests endocytosis but with kinetics that are relatively slow and therefore inconsistent with signaling being mediated solely through simple phosphorylation cascades. Here, we show that, in addition to regulation of the phosphorylation of endocytic proteins, TORC2 also controls endocytosis by modulating PM tension. Elevated PM tension, upon TORC2 inhibition, impinges on endocytosis at two different levels: first, by severing the bonds between the PM adaptor proteins Sla2 and Ent1 and the actin cytoskeleton; and, second, by hindering recruitment of Rvs167, an N-BAR-containing protein important for vesicle fission, to endocytosis sites. These results underline the importance of biophysical cues in the regulation of cellular and molecular processes.",

Within a processing hierarchy, it is thought that plasticity is increased at higher levels of cortical processing, but direct quantitative comparisons between low- and high-level plasticity have not been made so far. Here, we addressed this issue for the human cortical visual system. By quantifying plasticity as the complement of the heritability of functional connectivity, we demonstrate a non-monotonic relationship between plasticity and hierarchical level, such that plasticity decreases from early to mid-level cortex, and then increases further of the visual hierarchy. This non-monotonic relationship argues against recent theory that the balance between plasticity and stability is governed by the costs of the \\\"coding-catastrophe\\\", and can be explained by a concurrent decline of short-term adaptation and rise of long-term plasticity up the visual processing hierarchy.",

    "abstract": "Species have preferred environmental niches 1 and their geographical distributions respond to global climate change 2. Predicting range shifts under climate change has profound implications for conservation of biodiversity 3, provision of ecosystem services, and in the management of invasive species 4. Species distribution modelling (SDM) has largely focussed on climate variations, but biotic interactions, such as predation and competition, can alter potential distributions 5,6 and affect migration rates 7. However, a lack of data on biotic interactions has restricted consideration of these factors for many species 1. Here, we compare the power of biotic and climatic factors as predictors of global distributions of hundreds of crop pests and pathogens (CPPs), for which host preferences are known. We show that host availability is a more important predictor of endobiotic pathogen distributions (fungi, oomycetes, bacteria, viruses and nematodes) than of epibiotic pest distributions (insect herbivores). Conversely, climatic variables are better predictors of epibiotic pest distributions. These results are robust to statistical controls for varying observational capacity among countries. Our findings demonstrate that life history affects global scale species distributions and that SDM should incorporate biotic interactions as well as climate.",

    "abstract": "Determining the  space race between sympatric species is crucial to understand the effects of interspecific interactions on the extinction risk of species threatened by poachers, predators, pathogens, and invasive competitors. Dynamic two-species occupancy models provide a flexible framework to decompose complex species interaction patterns while accounting for imperfect detection. In particular, these models can describe poachers-wildlife interactions by considering the occupancy, the extinction and colonisation probabilities of wildlife conditional on the presence or absence of poachers and vice versa. We apply our model to a case study on wildlife poaching in the Eastern plains of Cambodia. We used co-occurrence data extracted from the database of the SMART partnership to study the distribution dynamics between poachers and six ungulate species regarded as main prey of tigers. We used 4 years of survey data reporting the locations of ranger patrols on the detection of snares with visual detections or presence signs of the ungulates. Our results showed that a substantial proportion of the sites occupied by ungulate species went extinct over the years of the study while the proportion of sites colonised by poachers increased. We also showed, for the first time, that spatio-temporal heterogeneity in the patrolling effort explains a great deal of the variation in the detection of poachers and ungulates. Our approach provides practitioners with a flexible and robust tool to assess conservation status of species and extinction risk of wildlife populations. It can assist managers in better evaluating, learning and adapting the patrolling strategies of rangers.",

The objective of this study was to estimate the genetic variability and find out the correlation among the different quantitative traits of rainfed early lowland rice. The experiment was conducted consecutively two years during 2015 and 2016 in wet season across the four different locations in Regional Agricultural Research Station, Khajura, National Wheat Research Program, Bhairahawa, National Maize Research Program, Rampur and National Rice Research Program, Hardinath along the Terai region of Nepal representing sub-tropical agro-climate. Seven genotypes including Hardinath-1 as standard check variety were evaluated in the randomized complete block design with three replications. Various quantitative traits were measured to investigate the variability and correlation coefficients. All the genotypes and locations showed significant variations for all the traits considered. Genotypic coefficient of variation was lower than phenotypic coefficient of variation for all traits studied. The magnitudes of genotypic coefficient of variations were relatively higher for grain yield, 1000-grain weight and days to heading. The highest broad sense heritability of 94% was recorded in days to maturity and the lowest heritability of 16% was observed in plant height. Positive and highly significant correlations were found both in genotypic and phenotypic levels between days to heading and days to maturity (rg=0.9999**, rp=0.997**), days to heading and grain yield (rg =0.9999**, rp= 0.9276**), days to maturity and grain yield (rg =0.9796**, rp=0.9174**). However, negative and highly significant genetic correlation was observed between plant height and 1000 grain weight (rg = -0.9999**). Thus results indicated that days to heading, days to maturity, grain yield, 1000 grain weight demonstrated higher heritability and remarkable genetic advance could be considered for the most appropriate traits for improvement and selection of trait to achieve stable and high yielding early rice genotypes under rainfed environments.",

We found Slp1 expression in immature leaf and inflorescence tissues. In the immature leaf active silicification zone, Slp1 was localized to the cytoplasm or near cell boundaries of silica cells. It was packed in vesicles and secreted to the paramural space. Transient overexpression of Slp1 in sorghum resulted in ectopic silica deposition in all leaf epidermal cell types.\\nC_LIO_LIOur results show that Slp1 precipitates silica in sorghum silica cells.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Mechanistic models of stochastic gene expression are of considerable interest, but their complexity often precludes tractable analytical expressions for mRNA and protein distributions. The lac operon of E. coli is a model system with regulatory elements such as multiple operators and DNA looping that are shared by many operons. Although this system is complex, intuition suggests that fast DNA looping may simplify it by causing the repressor-bound states of the operon to equilibrate rapidly, thus ensuring that the subsequent dynamics are governed by slow transitions between the repressor-free and the equilibrated repressor-bound states. Here, we show that this intuition is correct by applying singular perturbation theory to a mechanistic model of lac transcription with the scaled time constant of DNA looping as the perturbation parameter. We find that at steady state, the repressor-bound states satisfy detailed balance and are dominated by the looped states; moreover, the interaction between the repressor-free and the equilibrated repressor-bound states is described by an extension of the Peccoud-Ycart two-state model in which both (repressor-free and repressor-bound) states support transcription. The solution of this extended two-state model reveals that the steady state mRNA distribution is a mixture of the Poisson and negative hypergeometric distributions which reflects mRNAs obtained by transcription from the repressor-bound and repressor-free states, respectively. Finally, we show that the physics revealed by perturbation theory makes it easy to derive the extended two-state model equations for complex regulatory architectures.",

    "abstract": "Squamate reptiles exhibit high variation in their traits and geographical distribution and are therefore fascinating taxa for evolutionary and ecological research. However, high-quality genomic recourses are very limited for this group of species, which inhibits some research efforts. To address this gap, we assembled a high-quality genome of the common lizard Zootoca vivipara (Lacertidae) using a combination of high coverage Illumina (shotgun and mate-pair) and PacBio sequence data, with RNAseq data and genetic linkage maps. The 1.46 Gbp genome assembly has scaffold N50 of 11.52 Mbp with N50 contig size of 220.4 Kbp and only 2.96% gaps. A BUSCO analysis indicates that 97.7% of the single-copy Tetrapoda orthologs were recovered in the assembly. In total 19,829 gene models were annotated in the genome using a combination of three ab initio and homology-based methods. To improve the chromosome-level assembly, we generated a high-density linkage map from wild-caught families and developed a novel analytical pipeline to accommodate multiple paternity and unknown father genotypes. We successfully anchored and oriented almost 90% of the genome on 19 linkage groups. This annotated and oriented chromosome-level reference genome represents a valuable resource to facilitate evolutionary studies in squamate reptiles.",

    "abstract": "Animal social bonds are defined as stable, equitable and strong affiliative and cooperative relationships similar to human friendships. Just as human friendships, social bonds are thought to function as alliances that generate adaptive benefits via support in critical situations. In humans, similarity in many sociodemographic, behavioural and intrapersonal characteristics leads to trust and is predictive of friendships. Specifically, personality homophily, that is the tendency of individuals to form social bonds with others who have a similar personality, may increase predictability and facilitate trust and reciprocity among partners with compatible behavioural tendencies. While evidence for social bonding in nonhumans is accumulating, far less is known about its predictors. Here, personality homophily effects on the formation and maintenance of social bonds are shown in twenty-four wild male Assamese macaques (Macaca assamensis), at Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand. Dyadic bond strength increased with increased similarity in the trait Connectedness (i.e. frequent and diverse neighbours in 5m proximity and pronounced social tolerance, as high rates of friendly approaches to and by others). To differentiate whether homophily indeed predicted bond formation or whether bonded males personalities became more similar over time, we tested the stability of the connectedness traits in a subset of immigrating males that had to form new bonds. Connectedness in these males remained stable suggesting that males do not adapt their personality to their partner. Our results support the idea of a shared evolutionary origin of homophily as a partner choice strategy in human and non-human animals. The main selective advantage of personality similarity in animal social bonds may result from a more reliable cooperation among individuals with similar cooperative behavioural tendencies.",

    "abstract": "Protein degradation is an essential mechanism for maintaining homeostasis in response to internal and external perturbations. Disruption of this process is implicated in many human diseases, but quantitation of global stability rates has not yet been achieved in tissues. We have developed QUAD (Quantification of Azidohomoalanine Degradation), a technique to quantitate global protein degradation using mass spectrometry. Azidohomoalanine (AHA) is pulsed into mouse tissues through their diet. The mice are then returned to a normal diet and the decrease of AHA abundance can be quantitated in the proteome. QUAD analysis reveals that protein stability varied within tissues, but discernible trends in the data suggest that cellular environment is a major factor dictating stability. Within a tissue, different organelles, post-translation modifications, and protein functions were enriched with different stability patterns. Surprisingly, subunits of the TRIC molecular chaperonin possessed markedly distinct stability trajectories in the brain. Further investigation revealed that these subunits also possessed different subcellular localization and expression patterns that were uniquely altered with age and in Alzheimers disease transgenic mice, indicating a potential non-canonical chaperonin. Finally, QUAD analysis demonstrated that protein stability is enhanced with age in the brain but not in the liver. Overall, QUAD allows the first global quantitation of protein stability rates in tissues, which may lead to new insights and hypotheses in basic and translational research.\\n\\nSummaryProtein degradation is an important component of the proteostasis network, but no techniques are available to globally quantitate degradation rates in tissues. In this study, we demonstrate a new method QUAD (Quantification of Azidohomoalanine Degradation) that can accurately quantitate degradation rates in tissues. QUAD analysis of mouse tissues reveal that unique degradation trends can define different tissue proteomes. Within a tissue, specific protein characteristics are correlated with different levels of protein stability. Further investigation of the TRIC chaperonin with strikingly different subunit stabilities suggests a non-canonical chaperonin in brain tissue. Consistent with the theory that the proteostasis network is compromised with age, we discovered that protein stability is globally enhanced in brains of old mice compared to young mice.",

    "abstract": "The zebrafish has become a valuable model for examining ocular lens development, physiology and disease. The zebrafish cloche mutant, first described for its loss of hematopoiesis, also shows reduced eye and lens size, interruption in lens cell differentiation and a cataract likely caused by abnormal protein aggregation. To facilitate the use of the cloche mutant for studies on cataract development and prevention we characterized variation in the lens phenotype, quantified changes in gene expression by qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq and compared the ability of two promoters to drive expression of introduced proteins into the cloche lens. We found that the severity of cloche embryo lens cataract varied, while the decrease in lens diameter and retention of nuclei in differentiating lens fiber cells was constant. We found very low expression of both B-crystallin genes (cryaba and cryabb) at 4 days post fertilization (dpf) by both qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq in cloche, cloche sibling and wildtype embryos and no significant difference in A-crystallin (cryaa) expression. RNA-Seq analysis of 4 dpf embryos identified transcripts from 25,281 genes, with 1,329 showing statistically significantly different expression between cloche and wildtype samples. Downregulation of eight lens {beta}- and {gamma}M-crystallin genes and 22 retinal related genes may reflect a general reduction in eye development and growth. Six stress response genes were upregulated. We did not find misregulation of any known components of lens development gene regulatory networks. These results suggest that the cloche lens cataract is not caused by loss of A-crystallin or changes to lens gene regulatory networks. Instead, we propose that the cataract results from general physiological stress related to loss of hematopoiesis. Our finding that the zebrafish A-crystallin promoter drove strong GFP expression in the cloche lens demonstrates its use as a tool for examining the effects of introduced proteins on lens crystallin aggregation and cataract prevention.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between the hippocampus (area CA1) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) are crucial for memory-guided behavior. Theta oscillations (~8 Hz) underlie a key physiological mechanism for mediating these coordinated interactions, and theta oscillatory coherence and phase-locked spiking in the two regions have been shown to be important for spatial memory. Hippocampal place cell activity associated with theta oscillations encodes spatial position during behavior, and theta-phase associated spiking is known to further mediate a temporal code for space within CA1 place fields. Although prefrontal neurons are prominently phase-locked to hippocampal theta oscillations in spatial memory tasks, whether and how theta oscillations mediate processing of spatial information across these networks remains unclear. Here, we addressed these questions using simultaneous recordings of dorsal CA1 - PFC ensembles and population decoding analyses in male rats performing a continuous spatial working memory task known to require hippocampal-prefrontal interactions. We found that in addition to CA1, population activity in PFC can also encode the animals current spatial position on a theta-cycle timescale during memory-guided behavior. Coding of spatial position was coherent for CA1 and PFC ensembles, exhibiting correlated position representations within theta cycles. In addition, incorporating theta-phase information during decoding to account for theta-phase associated spiking resulted in a significant improvement in the accuracy of prefrontal spatial representations, similar to concurrent CA1 representations. These findings indicate a theta-oscillation mediated mechanism of temporal coordination for shared processing and communication of spatial information across the two networks during spatial memory-guided behavior.",

    "abstract": "The division rates of stem cells and their progeny shape the growth and maintenance of tissues. Here, we present a mathematical model that could estimate the stage-wise lifespans of germline stem cells (GSCs) and subsequent transit amplifying (TA) cells from their steady-state distribution in Drosophila testis. Analysis of the wild-type data using this model indicated that the inter-division lifespans of the first two TA cycles remain similar to that of the GSCs, and then reduce by nearly 2-folds for the third and fourth cycles. Also, loss of Cyclin E and Cdk1 functions in the early germline cells, which decreased the rates of GSC divisions, is suggested to extend the lifespans of GSCs and the TA stages without affecting subsequent differentiation. Similar perturbations at the 4 and 8-cell stages, however, arrested the mitoses at the 8-cell stage, and only the Cyclin E-deficient cells continued with premature meiosis. Together, these results suggest that regulation of the G1-S and G2-M transitions in the GSCs and the rapidly dividing TA stages differentially impacts the amplification of the germline pool and subsequent differentiation. The model also helped to quantify distinct influences of these cell cycle regulatory molecules in determining the lifespans at different TA stages.\\n\\nHighlightsA model for calculating the lifespans of transit amplifying stages from demography.

    "abstract": "Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon set in the gametes prior to fertilization that causes differential expression of parental alleles mainly in the endosperm of flowering plants. The overlap between previously identified panels of imprinted genes is limited. In order to achieve high resolution sequencing data we have used sequence capture technology to investigate imprinting. Here, we present a bioinformatics pipeline to assay parent-of-origin allele specific expression and report more than 300 loci with parental expression bias. We find that the level of expression from maternal and paternal alleles in most cases is not binary, instead favouring a differential dosage hypothesis for the evolution of imprinting in plants. To address imprinting regulation, we systematically employed mutations in regulative epigenetic pathways suggested to be major players in the process. We establish the mechanistic mode of imprinting for more than 50 loci regulated by DNA methylation and Polycomb-dependent histone methylation. However, the imprinting patterns of the majority of genes were not affected by these mechanisms. To this end we also demonstrate that the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway alone does not influence imprinting patterns in a substantial manner, suggesting more complex epigenetic regulation pathways for the majority of identified imprinted genes.\\n\\nAuthor summaryExpression of gene copies only from the mother or the fathers genome, also termed imprinting, is a specialized epigenetic phenomenon that is found to be enriched at some genes expressed in the mammalian placenta and in the endosperm of the plant seed. Although several studies have reported on imprinted genes in plants, the identified loci are at large non-overlapping between reports. This motivated us to investigate in detail the expression pattern of imprinted genes in the endosperm and to determine how imprinting patterns are established at various imprinted loci. Although several underlying epigenetic regulation mechanisms have been demonstrated to establish imprinting patterns at certain genes, the majority of imprinted genes have not been linked to such mechanisms. In the present study we systematically investigated the mechanisms that are involved in establishing imprinting, by employing mutants of epigenetic regulators and high-throughput sequencing. In our high resolution study, we report more than 300 imprinted genes and demonstrate that the biological phenomenon imprinting involves gradual expression of parental gene copies rather than switching gene copies on or off. Notably, for the majority of imprinted genes, the mechanisms previously believed to be major to establish their imprinting patterns, are not responsible for mediating imprinting.",

    "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely viewed as the gold standard for studying brain function due to its high spatial resolution and non-invasive nature. However, it is well established that changes in breathing patterns and heart rate strongly influence the blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal and this, in turn, can have considerable effects on fMRI studies, particularly resting-state studies. The dynamic effects of physiological processes are often quantified by using convolution models along with simultaneously recorded physiological data. In this context, physiological response function (PRF) curves (cardiac and respiratory response functions), which are convolved with the corresponding physiological fluctuations, are commonly employed. While it has often been suggested that the PRF curves may be region- or subject- specific, it is still an open question whether this is the case. In the present study, we propose a novel framework for the robust estimation of PRF curves and use this framework to rigorously examine the implications of using population-, subject-, session- and scan-specific PRF curves. The proposed framework was tested on resting-state fMRI and physiological data from the Human Connectome Project. Our results suggest that PRF curves vary significantly across subjects and, to a lesser extent, across sessions from the same subject. These differences can be partly attributed to physiological variables such as the mean and variance of the heart rate during the scan. The proposed methodological framework can be used to obtain robust scan-specific PRF curves from data records with duration longer than 5 minutes, exhibiting significantly improved performance compared to previously defined canonical cardiac and respiration response functions. Besides removing physiological confounds from the BOLD signal, accurate modeling of subject- (or session-/scan-) specific PRF curves is of importance in studies that involve populations with altered vascular responses, such as aging subjects.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIPhysiological response functions (PRF) vary considerably across subjects/sessions\\nC_LIO_LIScan-specific PRF curves can be obtained from data records longer than 5 minutes\\nC_LIO_LIThe shape of the cardiac response function is linked to the mean heart rate (HR)\\nC_LIO_LIBrain regions affected by HR and breathing patterns exhibit substantial overlap\\nC_LIO_LIHR and breathing patterns affect distinct regions as compared to cardiac pulsatility\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Calcium-calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) regulates many forms of synaptic plasticity, but little is known about its functional role during plasticity induction in the cerebellum. Experiments have indicated that the {beta} isoform of CaMKII controls the bidirectional inversion of plasticity at parallel fibre (PF)-Purkinje cell (PC) synapses in cerebellar cortex. Because the cellular events that underlie these experimental findings are still poorly understood, we developed a simple computational model to investigate how {beta}CaMKII regulates the direction of plasticity in cerebellar PCs. We present the first model of AMPA receptor phosphorylation that simulates the induction of long-term depression (LTD) and potentiation (LTP) at the PF-PC synapse. Our simulation results suggest that the balance of CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation and protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B)-mediated dephosphorylation of AMPA receptors can determine whether LTD or LTP occurs in cerebellar PCs. The model replicates experimental observations that indicate that {beta}CaMKII controls the direction of plasticity at PF-PC synapses, and demonstrates that the binding of filamentous actin to CaMKII can enable the {beta} isoform of the kinase to regulate bidirectional plasticity at these synapses.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMany molecules and the complex interactions between them are involved in synaptic plasticity in the cerebellum. However, the exact relationship between cerebellar plasticity and the different signalling cascades remains unclear. Calcium-calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is an important component of the signalling network that is responsible for plasticity in cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs). The CaMKII holoenzyme contains different isoforms such as CaMKII and {beta}CaMKII. Experiments with Camk2b knockout mice that lack the {beta} isoform of CaMKII demonstrated that {beta}CaMKII regulates the direction of plasticity at parallel fibre (PF)-PC synapses. Stimulation protocols that induce long-term depression in wild-type mice, which contain both  and {beta}CaMKII, lead to long-term potentiation in knockout mice without {beta}CaMKII, and vice versa. We developed a kinetic simulation of the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of AMPA receptors by CaMKII and protein phosphatase 2B to investigate how {beta}CaMKII can control bidirectional synaptic plasticity in cerebellar PCs. Our simulation results demonstrate that the binding of filamentous actin to {beta}CaMKII can contribute to the regulation of bidirectional plasticity at PF-PC synapses. Our computational model of intracellular signalling significantly advances the understanding of the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity induction in the cerebellum.",

We aimed to analyze the involvement of BW and body composition on HRV recovery following aerobic exercise in children. The study was conducted in healthy children 9 to 11 years of age (40 females and 27 males) divided into two groups: G1 (BW < 3400 grams, N = 33) and G2 (BW > 3400 grams, N = 34). The volunteers completed an experimental protocol of submaximal aerobic exercise on a treadmill and remained seated for 30 minutes after exercise. Systolic (SAP) and diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), respiratory rate (f) and HRV were analyzed before and during recovery from exercise. SAP and f were significantly decreased 30 minutes after exercise compared to 1 minute after exercise in G1 and G2. Mean HR, high frequency band of spectral analysis (HF), root mean square of successive interbeat intervals difference, SD1 index and mean lenght were diminished 0 to 5 minutes after exercise compared to rest in G2 while maximum lenght increased 0 to 5 minutes after exercise compared to resting in G2. Linear regression revealed association of fat percentage and BW with nonlinear HRV recovery. In conclusion, autonomic recovery after exercise was somewhat delayed in children with high BW.

    "abstract": "When facing fully ambiguous images, the brain cannot commit to a single percept and instead switches between mutually exclusive interpretations every few seconds, a phenomenon known as bistable perception. Despite years of research, there is still no consensus on whether bistability, and perception in general, is driven primarily by bottom-up or top-down mechanisms. Here, we adopted a Bayesian approach in an effort to reconcile these two theories. Fifty-five healthy participants were exposed to an adaptation of the Necker cube paradigm, in which we manipulated sensory evidence (by shadowing the cube) and prior knowledge (e.g., by varying instructions about what participants should expect to see). We found that manipulations of both sensory evidence and priors significantly affected the way participants perceived the Necker cube. However, we observed an interaction between the effect of the cue and the effect of the instructions, a finding incompatible with Bayes-optimal integration. In contrast, the data were well predicted by a circular inference model. In this model, ambiguous sensory evidence is systematically biased in the direction of current expectations, ultimately resulting in a bistable percept.",

    "abstract": "Chromokinesins NOD and KID have similar DNA binding domains and functions during cell division, while their motor domain sequences show significant variations. It has been unclear whether these motors have similar structure, chemistry, and microtubule interactions necessary to follow a similar mechanism of force mediation. We used biochemical rate measurements, cosedimentation, and structural analysis to investigate the ATPase mechanisms of the NOD and KID core domains. These experiments and analysis revealed that NOD and KID have different ATPase mechanisms, microtubule interactions, and catalytic domain structures. The ATPase cycles of NOD and KID have different rate limiting steps. The ATPase rate of NOD was robustly stimulated by microtubules albeit its microtubule affinity was weakened in all nucleotide bound states. KID bound microtubules tightly in all nucleotide states and remained associated with the microtubule for more than 100 cycles of ATP hydrolysis before dissociating. The structure of KID was most similar to conventional kinesin (KIF5). Key differences in the microtubule binding region and allosteric communication pathway between KID and NOD are consistent with our biochemical data. Our results support the model that NOD and KID utilize distinct mechanistic pathways to achieve the same function during cell division.",

    "abstract": "The spatiotemporal regulation of cAMP and its dynamic interactions with other second messengers such as calcium are critical features of signaling specificity required for neuronal development and connectivity. cAMP is known to contribute to long-term potentiation and memory formation by controlling the formation and regulation of dendritic spines. Despite the recent advances in biosensing techniques for monitoring spatiotemporal cAMP dynamics, the underlying molecular mechanisms that attribute to the subcellular modulation of cAMP remain unknown. In the present work, we model the spatio-temporal dynamics of calcium-induced cAMP signaling pathway in dendritic spines. Using a 3D reaction-diffusion model, we investigate the effect of different spatial characteristics of cAMP dynamics that may be responsible for subcellular regulation of cAMP concentrations. Our model predicts that the volume-to-surface ratio of the spine, regulated through the spine head size, spine neck size, and the presence of physical barriers (spine apparatus) is an important regulator of cAMP dynamics. Furthermore, localization of the enzymes responsible for the synthesis and degradation of cAMP in different compartments also modulates the oscillatory patterns of cAMP through exponential relationships. Our findings shed light on the significance of complex geometric and localization relationships for cAMP dynamics in dendritic spines.",

    "abstract": "The use of mathematical models for personalization of cancer therapies and raising hypothesis of potential clinical impact is an emerging topic in the interface between mathematics and oncology. Here we put forward a mathematical model describing the response of low-grade (WHO grade II) oligodendrogliomas (LGO) to temozolomide (TMZ). The model described the longitudinal volumetric dynamics of tumor response to TMZ of a cohort of 11 LGO patients treated with TMZ. After finding patient-specific parameters, different therapeutical strategies were tried computationally on the  in-silico twins of those patients. Chemotherapy schedules with larger-than-standard rest periods between consecutive cycles had either the same or better long-term efficacy than the standard 28-day cycles. The results were confirmed in a large virtual clinical trial including 2000 patients. These long-cycle schemes would also have reduced toxicity and defer the appearance of resistances.\\n\\nOn the basis of those results, a combination scheme consisting of five induction TMZ cycles given monthly plus 12 maintenance cycles given every three months was found to provide substantial survival benefits for the in-silico twins of the 11 LGO patients (median 5.69 years, range: 0.67 to 68.45 years) and in a large virtual trial including 2000 patients.

The model was used to explore alternative therapeutical protocols for the in-silico twins of the patients and in virtual clinical trials. The simulations show that enlarging the time interval between chemotherapy cycles would maintain the therapeutical efficacy, while limiting toxicity and defering the development of resistances. This may allow for improved drug-exposure by administering a larger number of cycles for longer treatment periods.

The physical map provides a framework for assembly of genome sequence and information for localization of genes that are difficult to find through positional cloning. To address the challenges of accurate assembly of the pea genome (~4.2 GB of which approximately 85% is repetitive sequences), we have adopted the WGP technology for assembly of a pea BAC library. Multi-dimensional pooling of 295,680 BAC clones and sequencing the ends of restriction fragments of pooled DNA generated 1,814 million high quality reads, of which 825 million were deconvolutable to 1.11 million unique WGP sequence tags. These WGP tags were used to assemble 220,013 BACs into contigs. Assembly of the BAC clones using the modified Fingerprinted Contigs (FPC) program has resulted in 13,040 contigs, consisting of 213,719 BACs, and 6,294 singleton BACs. The average contig size is 0.33 Mbp and the N50 contig size is 0.62 Mbp. WGPTM technology has proved to provide a robust physical map of the pea genome, which would have been difficult to assemble using traditional restriction digestion based methods. This sequence-based physical map will be useful to assemble the genome sequence of pea. Additionally, the 1.1 million WGP tags will support efficient assignment of sequence scaffolds to the BAC clones, and thus an efficient sequencing of BAC pools with targeted genome regions of interest.",

To address this challenge, we applied nanopore sequencing in search of the site of integration of Tg(Pou5f1-EGFP)2Mnm (also known as Oct4:EGFP), a widely used fluorescent reporter in mouse germ line research. Using this nanopore-based approach, we identified the site of Oct4:EGFP transgene integration near the telomere of Chromosome 9.

Color information is computed by downstream neurons that compare relative activity across the three cone types. How cone signals are combined at a cellular scale has been more difficult to resolve. This is especially true near the fovea, where spectrally-opponent neurons in the parvocellular pathway draw excitatory input from a single cone and thus even the smallest stimulus will engage multiple color-signaling neurons. We used an adaptive optics microstimulator to target individual and pairs of cones with light. Consistent with prior work, we found that color percepts elicited from individual cones were predicted by their spectral sensitivity, although there was considerable variability even between cones within the same spectral class. The appearance of spots targeted at two cones were predicted by an average of their individual activations. However, two cones of the same subclass elicited percepts that were systematically more saturated than predicted by an average. Together, these observations suggest both spectral opponency and prior experience influence the appearance of small spots.",

However, many of these processes are non-Markovian (i.e., memorial) due to, e.g., small reaction steps involved in synthesis or degradation of a macroscopic molecule. When interrogating aspects of a cellular network by experimental measurements (e.g., by singlemolecule and single-cell measurement technologies) of network components, a key need is to develop efficient approaches to simulate and compute joint distributions of these components. To cope with this computational challenge, we develop two efficient algorithms: stationary generalized Gillespie algorithm and stationary generalized finite state projection, both being established based on a stationary generalized chemical master equation. We show how these algorithms can be combined in a streamlined procedure for evaluation of non-Markovian effects in a general cellular network. Stationary distributions are evaluated in two models of constitutive and bursty gene expressions as well as a model of genetic toggle switch, each considering molecular memory. Our approach significantly expands the capability of stochastic simulation to investigate gene regulatory network dynamics, which has the potential to advance both understanding of molecular systems biology and design of synthetic circuits.\\n\\nAuthor summaryCellular systems are driven by interactions between subsystems via time-stamped discrete events, involving numerous components and reaction steps and spanning several time scales. Such biochemical reactions are subject to inherent noise due to the small numbers of molecules. Also, they could involve several small steps, creating a memory between individual events. Delineating these molecular stochasticity and memory of biomolecular networks are continuing challenges for molecular systems biology. We present a novel approach to compute the probability distribution in stochastic models of cellular processes with molecular memory based on stationary generalized chemical master equation. We map a stochastic system with memory onto a Markovian model with effective reaction propensity functions. This formulation enables us to efficiently develop algorithms under the Markovian framework, and thus systematically analyze how molecular memories regulate stochastic behaviors of biomolecular networks. Here we propose two representative algorithms: stationary generalized Gillespie algorithm and stationary generalized finite state projection algorithm. The former generate realizations with Monte Carlo simulation, but the later compute approximations of the probability distribution by solving a truncated version of stochastic process. Our approach is demonstrated by applying it to three different examples from systems biology: generalized birth-death process, a stochastic toggle switch model, and a 3-stage gene expression model.",

    "abstract": "Notwithstanding important advances in the context of single-variant pathogenicity identification, novel breakthroughs in discerning the origins of many rare diseases require methods able to identify more complex genetic models. We present here the Variant Combinations Pathogenicity Predictor (VarCoPP), a machine-learning approach that identifies pathogenic variant combinations in gene pairs (bi-locus variant combinations). We show that the results produced by this method are highly accurate and precise, an efficacy that is endorsed when validating the method on recently published independent disease-causing data. Confidence labels of 95% and 99% are identified, representing the probability of a bi-locus combination being a true pathogenic result, providing geneticists with rational markers to evaluate the most relevant pathogenic combinations and limit the search space and time. Finally, VarCoPP has been designed to act as an interpretable method that can provide explanations on why a bi-locus combination is predicted as pathogenic and which biological information is important for that prediction. This work provides an important new step towards the genetic understanding of rare diseases, paving the way to new clinical knowledge and improved patient care.",

    "abstract": "During vertebrate embryogenesis, the cranial neural crest (CNC) forms at the neural plate border and subsequently migrates and differentiates into many types of cells. The transcription factor Snail2, which is induced by canonical Wnt signaling to be expressed in the early CNC, is pivotal for CNC induction and migration in Xenopus. However, snail2 expression is silenced during CNC migration, and its roles at later developmental stages remain unclear. We generated a transgenic X. tropicalis line that expresses enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) driven by the snail2 promoter/enhancer, and observed eGFP expression not only in the pre-migratory and migrating CNC, but also the differentiating CNC. This transgenic line can be used directly to detect deficiencies in CNC development at various stages, including subtle perturbation of CNC differentiation. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry confirm that Snail2 is reexpressed in the differentiating CNC. Using a separate transgenic Wnt reporter line, we show that canonical Wnt signaling is also active in the differentiating CNC. Blocking Wnt signaling shortly after CNC migration causes reduced snail2 expression and impaired differentiation of CNC-derived head cartilage structures. These results suggest that Wnt signaling drives the reexpression of snail2 in the post-migratory CNC and regulates CNC differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Using the critical Ising model of the brain, integrated information as a measure of consciousness is measured in toy models of generic neural networks. Monte Carlo simulations are run on 159 random weighted networks analogous to small 5-node neural network motifs. The integrated information generated by this sample of small Ising models is measured across the model parameter space. It is observed that integrated information, as a type of order parameter not unlike a concept like magnetism, undergoes a phase transition at the critical point in the model. This critical point is demarcated by the peaks of the generalized susceptibility of integrated information, a point where the  consciousness of the system is maximally susceptible to perturbations and on the boundary between an ordered and disordered form. This study adds further evidence to support that the emergence of consciousness coincides with the more universal patterns of self-organized criticality, evolution, the emergence of complexity, and the integration of complex systems.\\n\\nAuthor summaryUnderstanding consciousness through a scientific and mathematical language is slowly coming into reach and so testing and grounding these emerging ideas onto empirical observations and known systems is a first step to properly framing this ancient problem. This paper in particular explores the Integrated Information Theory of Consciousness framed within the physics of the Ising model to understand how and when consciousness, or integrated information, can arise in simple dynamical systems. The emergence of consciousness is treated like the emergence of other classical macroscopic observables in physics such as magnetism and understood as a dynamical phase of matter. Our findings show that the sensitivity of consciousness in a complex system is maximized when the system is undergoing a phase transition, also known as a critical point. This result, combined with a body of evidence highlighting the privelaged state of critical systems suggests that, like many other complex phenomenon, consciousness may simply follow from/emerge out of the tendency of a system to self-organize to criticality.",

    "abstract": "The {beta}-catenin protein has two major known functions in animal cells. It keeps epithelial tissue homeostasis by its connection with Adherens Junctions (AJ), and it serves as a transcriptional cofactor along with Lef/Tcf to enter the nucleus and regulate target genes of the Wnt/{beta}-catenin (cWnt) signaling pathway. To assess the ancestral role of {beta}-catenin during development we examined its distribution and function in the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi (one of the earliest branching animal phyla) by using ctenophore-specific antibodies and mRNA injection. We found that {beta}-catenin protein never localizes to cell-cell contacts during embryogenesis as it does in other metazoans, most likely because ctenophore-cadherins do not have the cytoplasmic domain required for interaction with the catenin proteins. Downregulation of zygotic Ml{beta}-catenin signaling led to the loss of endodermal and mesodermal tissues indicating that nuclear {beta}-catenin may have a deep role in germ-layer evolution. Our results indicate that the ancestral role for {beta}-catenin was in the cell-fate specification and not in cell adhesion and also further emphasizes the critical role of this protein in the evolution of tissue layers in metazoans.",

    "abstract": "The sources of human germline mutations are poorly understood. Part of the difficulty is that mutations occur very rarely, and so direct pedigree-based approaches remain limited in the numbers that they can examine. To address this problem, we consider the spectrum of low frequency variants in a dataset (gnomAD) of 13,860 human X chromosomes and autosomes. X-autosome differences are reflective of germline sex differences, and have been used extensively to learn about male versus female mutational processes; what is less appreciated is that they also reflect chromosome-level biochemical features that differ between the X and autosomes. We tease these components apart by comparing the mutation spectrum in multiple genomic compartments on the autosomes and between the X and autosomes. In so doing, we are able to ascribe specific mutation patterns to replication timing and recombination, and to identify differences in the types of mutations that accrue in males and females. In particular, we identify C>G as a mutagenic signature of male meiotic double strand breaks on the X, which may result from late repair. Our results show how biochemical processes of damage and repair in the germline interact with sex-specific life history traits to shape mutation patterns on both the X chromosome and autosomes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a pervasive and clinically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social communication and interaction skills, and repetitive and stereotyped behaviours. It is known that ASD has a strong genetics component, but heritability estimates of 50-80% suggest that modifiable non-genetic factors may play an important role in the onset of the disorder. Recently, pre-, peri and post-natal exposure to a variety of environmental factors has been implicated in ASD. Yet, the comprehensive assessment of environmental exposures in this pathology, using large population datasets, is still lacking. The objective of this study was to pilot an environmental exposure assessment tool in Portugal.\\n\\nMethodsTo examine environmental exposures in a population of Portuguese children with ASD, we translated, adapted and piloted the Early Life Exposure Assessment Tool (ELEAT). The ELEAT was originally developed to assess environmental factors in studies of neurodevelopmental disorders. It is a questionnaire filled by mothers of children with ASD, enquiring about Demographic Information, Maternal Conditions/Medical Interventions, Breastfeeding and Child Diet, Maternal Diet, Supplements, Lifestyle, Home and Environment, Environment, Occupation and Exposures. The ELEAT gathers information about environmental exposure along key phases for early neurodevelopment, from 3 months prior to conception, pregnancy, labor and delivery to the first year of life of the child. Two focus groups were realized, one with mothers of typically-developing children and another with mothers of children with ASD, in order to discuss the mothers opinion regarding the tool comprehensiveness and relevance.\\n\\nResultsThe large majority of mothers were sure about their answers for all modules, with a small fraction of the group reporting difficulties for the Occupations/Exposures module. Most mothers considered the ELEAT to be a little too long, but generally found that the instructions were clear and, most importantly, agreed that the questions were important.\\n\\nConclusionsIntegration of the pilot feedback will allow us to enhance the tool and optimize its usage in Portuguese-speaking communities, improving its capacity to assemble accurate environmental data from diverse cultural settings, and to be extended to larger population datasets. Combined with genetic and clinical data, the ELEAT will contribute to the identification of modifiable lifestyle and environmental risk factors for ASD. Such evidence may eventually provide the opportunity for disease prevention or reduced severity by mitigating exposure when genetic susceptibility is identified early in life.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a clinically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder defined by deficits in social communication and interaction and repetitive and stereotyped interests and behaviors. ASD heritability estimates of 50-83% support a strong role of genetics in its onset, with large sequencing studies reporting a high burden of rare potentially pathogenic copy number variants (CNVs) and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in affected subjects. Recent data strongly suggests that prenatal to postnatal exposure to ubiquitous environmental factors (e.g. environmental toxins, medications and nutritional factors) contribute to ASD risk. Detoxification processes and physiological permeability barriers (i.e. blood-brain barrier, placenta and respiratory cilia) are crucial in regulating exposure and response to external agents during early development. Thus, the objectives of this study were: 1) to find genes involved in detoxification and regulation of barriers permeability with a high load of relevant CNVs and SNVs in ASD subjects; 2) to explore interactions between the identified genes and environmental factors relevant for the disorder.\\n\\nMaterial and MethodsThrough literature and databases review we searched for genes involved in detoxification and regulation of barriers permeability processes. Genetic data collected from large datasets of subjects with ASD (Autism Genome Project (AGP), Simmons Simplex Collection (SSC), and Autism Sequencing Consortium (ASC)) was used to identify potentially pathogenic variants targeting detoxification and barrier genes. Data from control subjects without neuropsychiatric disorder history was used for comparison purposes. The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) was interrogated to identify putatively relevant gene-environment interactions reported in humans throughout the literature.\\n\\nResultsWe compiled a list of 519 genes involved in detoxification and regulation of permeability barriers. The analysis of AGP and SSC data resulted in the identification of 7 genes more-frequently targeted by CNVs in ASD-subjects from both datasets, after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (AGP: P<3.5211x10-4; SSC: P< 4.587x10-4). Moreover, 8 genes were exclusively targeted by CNVs from ASD subjects. Regarding SNVs analyses using the ASC dataset, we found 40 genes targeted by potentially pathogenic loss-of-function and/or missense SNVs exclusive to 6 or more cases. The CTD was interrogated for interactions between 55 identified genes and 54 terms for unique chemicals associated with the disorder. A total of 212 gene-environment interaction pairs, between 51/55 (92.7%) genes and 38/54 (70.4%) chemicals, putatively relevant for ASD, were discovered. ABCB1, ABCG2, CYP2C19, GSTM1, CYP2D6, and SLC3A2 were the genes that interacted with more chemicals, while valproic acid, benzo(a)pyrene (b(a)p), bisphenol A, particulate matter and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) were the top chemicals.\\n\\nDiscussionThe identified genes code for functionally diverse proteins, ranging from enzymes that increase the degradability of xenobiotics (CYP450s, UGTs and GSTs), to transporters (ABCs and SLCs), proteins that regulate the correct function of barriers (claudins and dyneins) and placental hormones. The identified gene-environment interactions may reflect the fact that some genes and chemicals are understudied and that the potential neurotoxicity of many substances is unreported. We suggest that environmental factors can have pathogenic effects when individuals carry variants targeting these genes and discuss the potential mechanisms by which these genes can influence ASD risk.\\n\\nConclusionWe reinforce the hypothesis that gene-environment interactions are relevant, at least, for a subset of ASD cases. Given that no treatment exists for the pathology, the identification of relevant modifiable exposures can contribute to the development of preventive strategies for health management policies in ASD.",

Recurrent and metastatic disease is the principal cause of death and may be related to resistance within cancer stem cells (CSCs). Chromatin state is involved in maintaining signaling pathways related to stemness, and inhibition of histone deacetylase enzymes (HDAC) has emerged as an experimental therapeutic strategy to target this cell population. Here, we observed antitumor actions and changes in stemness induced by HDAC inhibition in MB. Analyses of tumor samples from patients with MB showed that the stemness markers BMI1 and CD133 are expressed in all molecular subgroups of MB. The HDAC inhibitor (HDACi) NaB reduced cell viability and expression of BMI1 and CD133 and increased acetylation in human MB cells. Enrichment analysis of genes associated with CD133 or BMI1 expression showed mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK signaling as the most enriched processes in MB tumors. MAPK/ERK inhibition reduced expression of the stemness markers, hindered MB neurosphere formation, and its antiproliferative effect was enhanced by combination with NaB. These results suggest that combining HDAC and MAPK/ERK inhibitors may be a novel and more effective approach in reducing MB proliferation when compared to single-drug treatments, through modulation of the stemness phenotype of MB cells.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the alterations in drug metabolism in different liver diseases is crucial for appropriate therapeutic intervention. We performed high-throughput RNA sequencing on various liver injury models, including cholestasis, diet-induced steatosis, and regeneration. Comparative liver transcriptome analysis revealed overlapping and distinct gene profiles among different liver diseases. Particularly, cholestatic livers displayed robust induction of drug metabolizing genes. This upregulation is not a generic hepatic stress response, as it was suppressed or unchanged in other models of liver diseases. Consistently, drug metabolic gene profiles were induced in a subset of biliary atresia patients, but not in individuals with hepatitis B or C viral infection, and alcoholic hepatitis. Further analysis revealed this induction was specific to genes regulated by nuclear receptor CAR (Constitutive Androstane Receptor). To test this, we challenged cholestatic mice with a paralytic agent, zoxazolamine. Compared to controls, these mice displayed significantly reduced paralysis time, reflecting increased drug metabolism, and this effect was lost upon inhibition of CAR. Thus, CAR activation can alter therapeutic efficacy of certain drugs in a subset of cholestatic individuals.",

    "abstract": "During adverse conditions, mammalian cells regulate protein production by sequestering the translational machinery in membrane-less organelles known as stress granules. Here, we found that activation of the G protein subunit Gq promoted the formation of particles that contained stress granule proteins through a mechanism linked to the presence of phospholipase C{beta}1 (PLC{beta}1) in the cytosol. In experiments with PC12 and A10 cells, we showed that under basal conditions, cytosolic PLC{beta}1 bound to stress granule associated proteins, including PABPC1, eIF5A, and Ago2. Knockdown of cytosolic PLC{beta}1 with siRNA or promoting its relocalization to the plasma membrane by activating Gq resulted in the formation of particles containing the stress granule markers, PABPC1, G3BP1, and Ago2. Our studies showed that the composition of these particles resemble those formed under osmotic stress and are distinct from those formed by other stresses. Our results fit a simple thermodynamic model in which cytosolic PLC{beta}1 solubilizes stress granule proteins such that its movement to activated Gq releases these particles to enable the formation of stress granules. Together, our data are suggestive of a link between Gq-coupled signals and protein translation through stress granule formation.",

    "abstract": "It has long been held that hip abduction compensates for reduced swing-phase knee flexion angle, especially in those after stroke. However, there are other compensatory motions such as pelvic obliquity (hip hiking) that could also be used to facilitate foot clearance with greater energy efficiency. Our previous work suggested that hip abduction may not be a compensation for reduced knee flexion after stroke. Previous study applied robotic knee flexion assistance in people with post-stroke Stiff-Knee Gait (SKG) during pre-swing, finding increased abduction despite improved knee flexion and toe clearance. Thus, our hypothesis was that hip abduction is not a compensation for reduced knee flexion. We simulated the kinematics of post-stroke SKG on unimpaired individuals with three factors: a knee orthosis to reduce knee flexion, an ankle-foot orthosis commonly worn by those post-stroke, and matching gait speeds. We compared spatiotemporal measures and kinematics between experimental factors within healthy controls and with a previously recorded cohort of people with post-stroke SKG. We focused on frontal plane motions of hip and pelvis as possible compensatory mechanisms. We observed that regardless of gait speed, knee flexion restriction significantly increased pelvic obliquity (2.79{degrees}, p<0.01) compared to unrestricted walking (1.5{degrees}, p<0.01), but similar to post-stroke SKG (3.4{degrees}). However, those with post-stroke SKG had significantly greater hip abduction (8.2{degrees}) compared to unimpaired individuals with restricted knee flexion (4.2{degrees}, p<0.05). These results show that pelvic obliquity, not hip abduction, compensates for reduced knee flexion angle. Thus, other factors, possibly neural, facilitate exaggerated hip abduction observed in post-stroke SKG.",

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a fatal genetic disease characterized by chronic lung infections due to aberrant mucus production and the inability to clear invading pathogens. The traditional view that CF infections are caused by a single pathogen has been replaced by the realization that the CF lung usually is colonized by a complex community of bacteria, fungi and viruses. To help unravel the complex interplay between the CF lung environment and the infecting microbial community, we developed a community metabolic model comprised of the 17 most abundant bacterial taxa, which account for >95% of reads across samples, from three published studies in which 75 sputum samples from 46 adult CF patients were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The community model was able to correctly predict high abundances of the \\\"rare\\\" pathogens Enterobacteriaceae, Burkholderia and Achromobacter in three patients whose polymicrobial infections were dominated by these pathogens. With these three pathogens were removed, the model correctly predicted that the remaining 43 patients would be dominated by Pseudomonas and/or Streptococcus. This dominance was predicted to be driven by relatively high monoculture growth rates of Pseudomonas and Streptococcus as well as their ability to efficiently consume amino acids, organic acids and alcohols secreted by other community members. Sample-by-sample heterogeneity of community composition could be qualitatively captured through random variation of the simulated metabolic environment, suggesting that experimental studies directly linking CF lung metabolomics and 16S sequencing could provide important insights into disease progression and treatment efficacy.\\n\\nImportanceCystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease in which chronic airway infections and lung inflammation result in respiratory failure. CF airway infections are usually caused by bacterial communities that are difficult to eradicate with available antibiotics. Using species abundance data for clinically stable adult CF patients assimilated from three published studies, we developed a metabolic model of CF airway communities to better understand the interactions between bacterial species and between the bacterial community and the lung environment. Our model predicted that clinically-observed CF pathogens could establish dominance over other community members across a range of lung nutrient conditions. Heterogeneity of species abundances across 75 patient samples could be predicted by assuming that sample-to-sample heterogeneity was attributable to random variations in the CF nutrient environment. Our model predictions provide new insights into the metabolic determinants of pathogen dominance in the CF lung and could facilitate the development of improved treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "The tumor suppressor protein p16INK4a (p16) is a well-established hallmark of aging that induces cellular senescence in response to stress. Previous studies have focused primarily on p16 regulation at the transcriptional level; comparatively little is known about the proteins intracellular localization and degradation. The autophagy-lysosomal pathway has been implicated in the subcellular trafficking and turnover of various stress-response proteins, but it is unclear whether p16 is involved in these pathways. Here, we investigate the role of autophagy, vesicular trafficking, and lysosomal degradation on p16 expression and localization in human epithelial cells. Time-lapse fluorescence microscopy using an endogenous p16-mCherry reporter revealed that autophagy induced by genotoxic stress stimulates rapid p16 recruitment to acidic cytoplasmic vesicles. When vesicular acidification was inhibited by NH4Cl, nuclear p16 levels increased. Single-cell imaging revealed that p16 localizes to lysosomes upon stress, implicating the autophagy pathway as a regulator of p16 localization. Blocking autophagy with bafilomycin, chloroquine, or NH4Cl resulted in elevated p16 protein levels without increased transcription. Increased p16 coincided with accumulation of autophagosome chaperone p62/SQSTM1 (p62) and decreased levels of phosphorylated-Rb. Furthermore, chloroquine caused p16 aggregation within stalled vesicles containing autophagosome marker LC3, demonstrating that p16 is transported and degraded by the autophagy-lysosomal pathway. Knockdown of p62 resulted in delocalization of p16 aggregates to autophagosomes, suggesting that p16 is targeted to these vesicles by p62. Taken together, these results implicate the autophagy pathway as a novel regulator of p16 degradation and localization, which could play a role in the etiology of cancer and age-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "A variety of cell surface structures, including capsular polysaccharides (CPS), dictate interactions between bacteria and their environment including their viruses (bacteriophages). Members of the prominent human gut Bacteroidetes characteristically produce several phase-variable CPS, but their contributions to bacteriophage interactions are unknown. We used engineered strains of the human symbiont Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, which differ only in the CPS they express, to isolate bacteriophages from two locations in the United States. Testing each of 71 bacteriophages against a panel of strains that express wild-type phase-variable CPS, one of eight different single CPS, or no CPS at all, revealed that each phage infects only a subset of otherwise isogenic strains. Deletion of infection-permissive CPS from B. thetaiotaomicron was sufficient to abolish infection for several individual bacteriophages, while infection of wild-type B. thetaiotaomicron with either of two different bacteriophages rapidly selected for expression of non-permissive CPS. Surprisingly, acapsular B. thetaiotaomicron also escapes complete killing by these bacteriophages, but surviving bacteria exhibit increased expression of 8 distinct phase-variable lipoproteins. When constitutively expressed, one of these lipoproteins promotes resistance to multiple bacteriophages. Finally, both wild-type and acapsular B. thetaiotaomicron were able to separately co-exist with one bacteriophage for over two months in the mouse gut, suggesting that phase-variation promotes resistance but also generates sufficient numbers of susceptible revertants to allow bacteriophage persistence. Our results reveal important roles for Bacteroides CPS and other cell surface structures that allow these bacteria to persist despite bacteriophage predation and hold important implications for using bacteriophages therapeutically to target gut symbionts.",

    "abstract": "Early termination of status epilepticus affords protection against brain damage and associated pathologies. Regulation of Kv7.2/7.3 potassium channels, underlying the neuronal M-current, is key for seizure control. This conductance is maintained during initiation of action potentials, affecting neuronal excitability and thus inhibiting epileptic discharges. The M-current is upregulated by the neuronal isoform of the serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase SGK1 (SGK1.1). We tested whether SGK1.1 is an anticonvulsant factor using the kainic acid (KA) model of acute seizures in a transgenic mouse model with expression of a constitutively active form of the kinase. Our results demonstrate that SGK1.1 confers robust protection against seizures associated to lower mortality levels, independently of sex or genetic background. SGK1.1-dependent protection results in reduced number, shorter duration, and early termination of EEG seizures. At the cellular level, it is associated to increased M-current amplitude mediated by Nedd4-2 phosphorylation, leading to decreased excitability of hippocampal CA1 neurons without alteration of basal synaptic transmission. Altogether, our results reveal that SGK1.1-mediated M-current upregulation in the hippocampus is a key component of seizure resistance in the KA epileptic paradigm, suggesting that regulation of this anticonvulsant pathway may improve adverse outcomes to status epilepticus, constituting a potential target for antiepileptic drugs.",

Whereas its membrane proximal and cytoplasmic domains have been functionally and structurally characterized, the role of ICA512 N-terminal segment named  regulated endocrine-specific protein 18 homology domain (RESP18HD), which encompasses residues 35-131, remains largely unknown. Here we show that ICA512 RESP18HD residues 91-131 encode for an intrinsically disordered region (IDR), which in vitro acts as a condensing factor for the reversible aggregation of insulin and other {beta}-cell proteins in a pH and Zn2+regulated fashion. At variance with what has been shown for other granule cargoes with aggregating properties, the condensing activity of ICA512 RESP18HD is displayed at pH close to neutral, i.e. in the pH range found in the early secretory pathway, while it is resolved at acidic pH and Zn2+ concentrations resembling those present in mature SGs. Moreover, we show that ICA512 RESP18HD residues 35-90, preceding the IDR, inhibit insulin fibrillation in vitro. Finally, we found that glucose-stimulated secretion of RESP18HD upon exocytosis of SGs from insulinoma INS-1 cells is associated with cleavage of its IDR, conceivably to prevent its aggregation upon exposure to neutral pH in the extracellular milieu. Taken together, these findings point to ICA512 RESP18HD being a condensing factor for protein sorting and granulogenesis early in the secretory pathway, and for prevention of amyloidogenesis.",

In the presence of mutations, functional replicators (ribozymes) are turned into non-functional ones (parasites). We evaluate the phase diagram of a system undergoing transient compartmentalization with selection. The system can exhibit either coexistence of ribozymes and parasites, or a pure parasite phase. If the mutation rate exceeds a certain level called the error threshold, the only stable phase is the pure parasite one. Transient compartmentalization with selection can relax this error treshold with respect to a bulk quasispecies case, and even allow ribozymes to coexist with faster growing parasites.\\n\\nIn order to analyze the role of noise, we also introduce a model for the replication of a template by an enzyme. This model admits two regimes: a diffusion limited regime which generates a high noise, and a replication limited regime, which generates a low noise at the population level. Based on this model, we find that, since the ribozyme dynamics belongs to the replication limited regime, the effects of noise on the phase diagram of the system are mostly negligible.

    "abstract": "Neuronal physiology is particularly sensitive to acute stressors that affect excitability, many of which can trigger seizures and epilepsies. Although intrinsic neuronal homeostasis plays an important role in maintaining overall nervous system robustness and its resistance to stressors, the specific genetic and molecular mechanisms that underlie these processes are not well understood. Here we used a reverse genetic approach in Drosophila to test the hypothesis that specific voltage-gated ion channels contribute to neuronal homeostasis, robustness, and stress resistance. We found that the activity of the voltage-gated potassium channel seizure (sei), an ortholog of the mammalian ERG channel family, is essential for protecting flies from acute heat-induced seizures. Although sei is broadly expressed in the nervous system, our data indicate that its impact on the organismal robustness to acute environmental stress is primarily mediated via its action in excitatory neurons, the octopaminergic system, as well as glia. Furthermore, our studies suggest that human mutations in the human ERG channel (hERG), which have been primarily implicated in the cardiac Long QT Syndrome (LQTS), may also contribute to the high incidence of seizures in LQTS patients via a cardiovascular-independent neurogenic pathway.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryNeurons are extremely sensitive to diverse environmental stressors, including rapid changes in the ambient temperature. To buffer stress, all animals have evolved diverse physiological mechanisms to protect neuronal activity from acute and chronic stressors, and failures of these safeguards often lead to hyperexcitability, episodic seizures, and chronic epilepsy. Although seizures and related syndromes are common, their underlying molecular and genetic factors, and their interactions with environmental triggers, remain mostly unknown. Here, we show that in the fruit fly, mutations in the ERG voltage-gated potassium channel seizure (sei), an ortholog of the human hERG channel that has been previously implicated in the cardiac Long-QT syndrome, could also increase seizure susceptibility. We demonstrate that in addition to its cardiac expression, the sei channel is broadly expressed in the nervous system, specifically localized to axonal projections, and is specifically required in excitatory and modulatory neurons, as well as non-neuronal glia for maintaining organismal resistance to heat-induced seizures. Thus, our work suggests that the previously reported increase in seizure susceptibility in individuals with mutations in hERG are likely directly related to its neuronal action, independent of its cardiac function.",

We combined single molecule localization microscopy with Clus-DoC cluster analysis, and also a novel unbiased cluster analysis to analyze changes in the relationships between 5-LO and FLAP in response to activation of RBL-2H3 cells to generate leukotriene C4. We identified the time-dependent reorganization of both 5-LO and FLAP into higher-order assemblies or clusters in response to cell activation via the IgE receptor. Clus-DoC analysis identified a subset of these clusters with a high degree of interaction between 5-LO and FLAP that specifically correlates with the time course of LTC4 synthesis, strongly suggesting their role in the initiation of leukotriene biosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "Transforming data from genome-scale assays into knowledge of affected molecular functions and pathways is a key challenge in biomedical research. Using vocabularies of functional terms and databases annotating genes with these terms, pathway enrichment methods can identify terms enriched in a gene list. With data that can refer to intergenic regions, however, one must first connect the regions to the terms, which are usually annotated only to genes. To make these connections, existing pathway enrichment approaches apply unwarranted assumptions such as annotating non-coding regions with the terms from adjacent genes. We developed a computational method that instead links genomic regions to annotations using data on long-range chromatin interactions. Our method, Biological Enrichment of Hidden Sequence Targets (BEHST), finds Gene Ontology (GO) terms enriched in genomic regions more precisely and accurately than existing methods. We demonstrate BEHSTs ability to retrieve more pertinent and less ambiguous GO terms associated with results of in vivo mouse enhancer screens or enhancer RNA assays for multiple tissue types. BEHST will accelerate the discovery of affected pathways mediated through long-range interactions that explain non-coding hits in genome-wide association study (GWAS) or genome editing screens. BEHST is free software with a command-line interface for Linux or macOS and a web interface (http://behst.hoffmanlab.org/).",

    "abstract": "The presence of tumor-infiltrating T cells is associated with favorable patient outcomes, yet most pancreatic cancers are immunologically silent and resistant to currently available immunotherapies. Here we show using a syngeneic orthotopic implantation model of pancreatic cancer that Pik3ca regulates tumor immunogenicity. Genetic silencing of Pik3ca in KrasG12D/Trp53R172H-driven pancreatic tumors leads to infiltration of T cells, complete tumor regression, and 100% survival of immunocompetent host mice. By contrast, Pik3ca-null tumors implanted in T cell-deficient mice progress and kill all of the animals. Adoptive transfer of tumor antigen-experienced T cells eliminates Pik3ca-null tumors in immunodeficient mice. Loss of PIK3CA or inhibition of its effector, AKT, increases the expression of MHC Class I and CD80 on tumor cells. These changes contribute to the increased susceptibility of Pik3ca-null tumors to T cell surveillance. These results indicate that tumor cell PIK3CA-AKT signaling limits T cell recognition and clearance of pancreatic cancer cells. Strategies that target this pathway may yield an effective immunotherapy for this cancer.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEPIK3CA-AKT signaling in pancreatic cancer cells limits T cell infiltration and clearance of tumors by suppressing the surface expression of MHC Class I and CD80. Targeting the PIK3CA-AKT pathway in tumor cells provides a new avenue for discovery of novel pancreatic cancer immunotherapies.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have identified breast cancer risk variants in over 150 genomic regions, but the mechanisms underlying risk remain largely unknown. These regions were explored by combining association analysis with in silico genomic feature annotations. We defined 205 independent risk-associated signals with the set of credible causal variants (CCVs) in each one. In parallel, we used a Bayesian approach (PAINTOR) that combines genetic association, linkage disequilibrium, and enriched genomic features to determine variants with high posterior probabilities (HPPs) of being causal. Potentially causal variants were significantly over-represented in active gene regulatory regions and transcription factor binding sites. We applied our INQUSIT pipeline for prioritizing genes as targets of potentially causal variants, using gene expression (eQTL), chromatin interaction and functional annotations. Known cancer drivers, transcription factors and genes in the developmental, apoptosis, immune system and DNA integrity checkpoint gene ontology pathways, were over-represented among the 178 highest confidence target genes.",

    "abstract": "Widely used microbial taxonomies, such as the NCBI taxonomy, are based on a combination of sequence homology among conserved genes and historically accepted taxonomies, which were developed based on observable traits such as morphology and physiology. A recently-proposed alternative taxonomy, the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB), incorporates only sequence homology of conserved genes and attempts to partition taxonomic ranks such that each rank implies the same amount of evolutionary distance, regardless of its position on the phylogenetic tree. This provides the first opportunity to completely separate taxonomy from traits, and therefore to quantify how taxonomic rank corresponds to traits across the microbial tree of life. We quantified the enrichment of clusters of orthologous gene functional categories (COG-FCs) as a proxy for traits within the lineages of 13,735 cultured and uncultured microbial lineages from a custom-curated genome database. On average, 41.4% of the variation in COG-FC enrichment is explained by taxonomic rank, with domain, phylum, class, order, family, and genus explaining, on average, 3.2%, 14.6%, 4.1%, 9.2%, 4.8%, and 5.5% of the variance, respectively (p<0.001 for all). To our knowledge, this is the first work to quantify the variance in metabolic potential contributed by individual taxonomic ranks. A qualitative comparison between the COG-FC enrichments and genus-level phylogenies, generated from published concatenated protein sequence alignments, further supports the idea that metabolic potential is taxonomically coherent at higher taxonomic ranks. The quantitative analyses presented here constrain the integral relationship between diversification of microbial lineages and the metabolisms which they host.\\n\\nImportanceRecently there has been great progress in defining a complete taxonomy of bacteria and archaea, which has been enabled by improvements in DNA sequencing technology and new bioinformatic techniques. A new, algorithmically-defined microbial tree of life describes those linkages relying solely on genetic data, which raises the question of how microbial traits relate to taxonomy. Here, we adopted cluster of orthologous group functional categories as a scheme to describe the genomic contents of microbes, which can be applied to any microbial lineage for which genomes are available. This simple approach allows quantitative comparisons between microbial genomes with different gene composition from across the microbial tree of life. Our observations demonstrate statistically significant patterns in cluster of orthologous group functional categories at the taxonomic levels spanning from domain to genus.",
