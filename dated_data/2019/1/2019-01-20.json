    "abstract": "Oscillatory neural activity is a fundamental characteristic of the mammalian brain spanning multiple levels of spatial and temporal scale. Current theories of neural oscillations and analysis techniques employed to investigate their functional significance are based on an often implicit assumption: In the absence of experimental manipulation, the spectral content of any given EEG- or MEG-recorded neural oscillator remains approximately stationary over the course of a typical experimental session (~1 hour), spontaneously fluctuating only around its dominant frequency. Here, we examined this assumption for ongoing neural oscillations in the alpha-band (8:13 Hz). We found that alpha peak frequency systematically decreased over time, while alpha-power increased. Intriguingly, these systematic changes showed partial independence of each other: Statistical source separation (independent component analysis) revealed that while some alpha components displayed concomitant power increases and peak frequency decreases, other components showed either unique power increases or frequency decreases. Interestingly, we also found these components to differ in frequency. Components that showed mixed frequency/power changes oscillated primarily in the lower alpha-band (~8-10Hz), while components with unique changes oscillated primarily in the higher alpha-band (~9-13Hz). Our findings provide novel clues on the time-varying intrinsic properties of large-scale neural networks as measured by M/EEG, with implications for the analysis and interpretation of studies that aim at identifying functionally relevant oscillatory networks or at driving them through external stimulation.",

    "abstract": "Long-term imaging of sensory cortex reveals a diverse range of stimulus response stability: some neurons retain stimulus responses that are stable over days whereas other neurons have highly plastic stimulus responses. Using a recurrent network model, we explore whether this observation could be due to an underlying diversity in the synaptic plasticity of neurons. We find that, in a network with diverse learning rates, neurons with fast rates are more coupled to population activity than neurons with slow rates. This phenomenon, which we call a plasticity-coupling link, surprisingly predicts that neurons with high population coupling exhibit more long-term stimulus response variability than neurons with low population coupling. We substantiate this prediction using recordings from the Allen Brain Observatory which track the orientation preferences of 15,000 neurons in mouse visual cortex. In agreement with our model, a neurons population coupling is correlated with the plasticity of its orientation preference. Finally, we show that high population coupling helps plastic neurons alter their stimulus preference during a simple perceptual learning task, but hinders the ability of stable neurons to provide an instructive signal for learning. This suggests a particular functional architecture: a stable  backbone of stimulus representation formed by neurons with slow synaptic plasticity and low population coupling, on top of which lies a flexible substrate of neurons with fast synaptic plasticity and high population coupling.",

Modern human variation and the interactions between different hominin lineages are now well studied, making it reasonable to go beyond fixed changes and explore changes that are observed at high frequency in present-day humans. Here, we identify 571 genes with non-synonymous changes at high frequency. We suggest that molecular mechanisms in cell division and networks affecting cellular features of neurons were prominently modified by these changes. Complex phenotypes in brain growth trajectory and cognitive traits are likely influenced by these networks and other changes presented here. We propose that at least some of these changes contributed to uniquely human traits, and should be prioritized for experimental validation.",

    "abstract": "Replication is considered to be critical for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in humans, but is not routinely performed in model organisms. We explored replication using an advanced intercross line (AIL) which is the simplest possible multigenerational intercross. We re-genotyped a previously published cohort of LG/J x SM/J AIL mice (F34; n=428) using a denser marker set and also genotyped a novel cohort of AIL mice (F39-43; n=600) for the first time. We identified 110 significant loci in the F34 cohort, 36 of which were new discoveries attributable to the denser marker set; we also identified 27 novel significant loci in the F39-43 cohort. For traits measured in both cohorts (locomotor activity, body weight, and coat color), the genetic correlations were high, although, the F39-43 cohort showed systematically lower SNP-heritability estimates. We then attempted to replicate loci identified in either F34 or F39-43 in the other cohort. Albino coat color was robustly replicated; we observed only partial replication of associations for locomotor activity and body weight. Finally, we performed a mega-analysis of locomotor activity and body weight by combining F34 and F39-43 cohorts (n=1,028), which identified four novel loci. The incomplete replication was inconsistent with simulations we performed to estimate our power to replicate. This may reflect: 1) false positives errors in the discovery cohort, 2) environmental or genetic heterogeneity between the two samples, or 3) the systematic over estimation of the effect sizes at significant loci (\\\"Winners Curse\\\"). Our results demonstrate that it is difficult to replicate GWAS results even when using similarly sized discovery and replication cohorts drawn from the same population.",

Identifying the traits that make species vulnerable might help us to predict the outcome for those less known. We gathered information on the relations of traits to extinction risk from 173 publications, across all taxa, spatial scales and biogeographical regions, in what we think it is the most comprehensive compilation to date. Vertebrates and the Palaearctic are the most studied taxon and region because of higher accumulation of data in these groups. Among the many traits that have been suggested to be good predictors, our meta-analyses were successful in identifying two as potentially useful in assessing risk for the lesser-known species: regardless of the taxon, species with small range and habitat breadth are more vulnerable to extinction. On the other hand, body size (the most studied trait) did not present a consistently positive or negative response. In line with recent research, we hypothesize that the relationship between body size and extinction risk is shaped by different aspects, namely body size is a proxy for different phenomena depending on the taxonomic group.",

    "abstract": "Tissue growth is a fundamental aspect of development and is intrinsically noisy. Stochasticity has important implications for morphogenesis, precise control of organ size, and regulation of tissue composition and heterogeneity. Yet, the basic statistical properties of growing tissues, particularly when growth induces mechanical stresses that can in turn affect growth rates, have received little attention. Here, we study the noisy growth of elastic sheets subject to mechanical feedback. Considering both isotropic and anisotropic growth, we find that the density-density correlation function shows power law scaling. We also consider the dynamics of marked, neutral clones of cells. We find that the areas (but not the shapes) of two clones are always statistically independent, even when they are adjacent. For anisotropic growth, we show that clone size variance scales like the average area squared and that the mode amplitudes characterizing clone shape show a slow 1/n decay, where n is the mode index. This is in stark contrast to the isotropic case, where relative variations in clone size and shape vanish at long times. The high variability in clone statistics observed in anisotropic growth is due to the presence of two soft modes--growth modes that generate no stress. Our results lay the groundwork for more in-depth explorations of the properties of noisy tissue growth in specific biological contexts.",

The underlying cellular and molecular mechanism is however not yet understood. We established an epidermal commitment model using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and characterized differentiation defects of iPSCs derived from ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, and cleft lip/palate (EEC) syndrome patients carrying p63 mutations. Transcriptome analyses revealed distinct step-wise cell fate transitions during epidermal commitment; from multipotent simple epithelium to basal stratified epithelia, and ultimately to the mature epidermal fate. Differentiation defects of EEC iPSCs caused by mutant p63 occurred during the specification switch from the simple epithelium to the basal stratified epithelial fate. Single-cell transcriptome and pseudotime analyses identified signatures of embryonic epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) associated with the deviated commitment route of EEC iPSCs. Repressing mesodermal activation reversed the EMT and enhanced epidermal commitment. Our findings demonstrate that p63 is required for specification of stratified epithelia, probably by repressing embryonic EMT during epidermal commitment. This study provides insights into disease mechanisms underlying stratified epithelial defects caused by p63 mutations and suggests potential therapeutic strategies for the disease.\\n\\nSignificance statementMutations in p63 cause several developmental disorders with defects of epithelial related organs and tissues including the epidermis.

    "abstract": "A series of well-synchronized events mediated by kinetochore-microtubule interactions ensure faithful chromosome segregation in eukaryotes. Centromeres scaffold kinetochore assembly and are among the fastest evolving chromosomal loci in terms of the DNA sequence, length, and organization of intrinsic elements. Neither the centromere structure nor the kinetochore dynamics is well studied in plant pathogenic fungi. Here, we sought to understand the process of chromosome segregation in the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae. High-resolution confocal imaging of GFP-tagged inner kinetochore proteins, CenpA and CenpC, revealed an unusual albeit transient declustering of centromeres just before anaphase separation in M. oryzae. Strikingly, the declustered centromeres positioned randomly at the spindle midzone without an apparent metaphase plate per se. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing, all seven centromeres were identified as CenpA-rich regions in the wild-type Guy11 strain of M. oryzae. The centromeres in M. oryzae are regional and span 57 to 109 kb transcriptionally poor regions. No centromere-specific DNA sequence motif or repetitive elements could be identified in these regions suggesting an epigenetic specification of centromere function in M. oryzae. Highly AT-rich and heavily methylated DNA sequences were the only common defining features of all the centromeres in the Rice Blast. Detailed gene synteny analyses helped identify and compare the centromere regions in distinct isolates of M. oryzae and its related species Magnaporthe poae. Overall, this study identifies unusual centromere dynamics and maps the centromere DNA sequences in the top model fungal pathogen M. oryzae, which causes severe losses in global rice production.\\n\\nSignificanceMagnaporthe oryzae is an important fungal pathogen that causes an annual loss of 10-30% rice crop due to the devastating blast disease. In most organisms, kinetochores are arranged either in the metaphase plate or are clustered together to facilitate synchronized anaphase separation of chromosomes. In this study, we show that the initially clustered kinetochores separate and position randomly prior to anaphase in M. oryzae. Centromeres, identified as the site of kinetochore assembly, are regional type without any shared sequence motifs in M. oryzae. Together, this study reveals atypical kinetochore dynamics and identifies functional centromeres in M. oryzae, thus paving the way to define heterochromatin boundaries and understand the process of kinetochore assembly on epigenetically specified centromere loci.",

    "abstract": "Clustering of proteins is crucial for many cellular processes and can be imaged at nanoscale resolution using single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). Ideally, molecular clustering in regions of interest (ROIs) from SMLM images would be assessed using computational methods that are robust to sample and experimental heterogeneity, account for uncertainties in localization data, can analyze both 2D and 3D data, and have practical computational requirements in terms of time and hardware. While analyzing surface protein clustering on B lymphocytes using SMLM, we encountered limitations with existing cluster analysis methods. This inspired us to develop StormGraph, an algorithm using graph theory and community detection to identify clusters in heterogeneous sets of 2D and 3D SMLM data while accounting for localization uncertainties. StormGraph generates both multi-level and single-level clusterings and can quantify cluster overlap for two-color SMLM data. Importantly, StormGraph automatically determines scale-dependent thresholds from the data using scale-independent input parameters. This makes identical choices of input parameter values suitable for disparate ROIs, eliminating the need to tune parameters for different ROIs in heterogeneous SMLM datasets. We show that StormGraph outperforms existing algorithms at analyzing heterogeneous sets of simulated SMLM ROIs where ground-truth clusters are known. Applying StormGraph to real SMLM data in 2D, we reveal that B-cell antigen receptors (BCRs) reside in a heterogeneous combination of small and large clusters following stimulation, which suggests for the first time that two conflicting models of BCR activation are not mutually exclusive. We also demonstrate application of StormGraph to real two-color and 3D SMLM data.",

    "abstract": "Pre-mRNA splicing is vital for the proper function and regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used as a model organism for studies of RNA splicing because of the striking conservation of the spliceosome components and its catalytic activity. Nonetheless, there are relatively few annotated alternative splice forms, particularly when compared to higher eukaryotes. Here, we describe a method to combine large scale RNA sequencing data to accurately discover novel splice isoforms in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using our method, we find extensive evidence for novel splicing of annotated intron-containing genes as well as genes without previously annotated introns and splicing of transcripts that are antisense to annotated genes. By incorporating several mutant strains at varied temperatures, we find conditions which lead to differences in alternative splice form usage. Despite this, every class and category of alternative splicing we find in our datasets is found, often at lower frequency, in wildtype cells under normal growth conditions. Together, these findings show that there is widespread splicing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, thus expanding our view of the regulatory potential of RNA splicing in yeast.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryPre-mRNA splicing is a fundamental step in eukaryotic gene expression. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, also known as brewers yeast, is a model organism for the study of pre-mRNA splicing in eukaryotes. Through the process of pre-mRNA splicing, a single gene is capable of encoding multiple mature mRNA products, but it is often difficult to identify the splice events that lead to these mRNA products. Here, we describe a method to accurately discover novel splice events in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and find evidence for extensive splicing in Saccharomyces. By utilizing a variety of strains and growth conditions, we are able to characterize many splice forms and correlate cellular conditions with prevalence of novel splice events.",

    "abstract": "The ability to preselect the sex of livestock is economically beneficial and significantly increases the welfare and proper use of animals. In the poultry industry, for example, almost all males are brutally and unnecessarily killed shortly after hatching. The labor and associated costs of separation of females from males, as well as the massive killing of males, could be reduced by using a system that biases the sex of the progeny. Here, we provide a first proof of concept for such a system by crossing two genetically engineered mouse lines. The maternal line encodes a functional Cas9 protein on an autosomal chromosome, whereas the paternal line encodes guide RNAs on the Y chromosome targeting vital mouse genes. After fertilization, the presence of both the Y-encoded guide RNAs from the paternal sperm and the Cas9 protein from the maternal egg target the vital genes in males. We show that this breeding consequently self-destructs solely the males. Our results pave the way for a biased sex production of livestock, thus saving labor, costs, and eliminating substantial animal suffering.",

Feedforward sensory information dominates the motor behavior during the open-loop pursuit, and a more complex feedback loop regulates the steady-state pursuit. To understand the neural representations of motion direction during open-loop and steady-state smooth pursuits, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) responses from human observers while they tracked random dot kinematograms as pursuit targets. We estimated population direction tuning curves from multivariate EEG activity using an inverted encoding model. We found significant direction tuning curves as early as 20 ms from motion onset. Direction tuning responses were generalized to later times during the open-loop smooth pursuit, but they became more dynamic during the later steady-state pursuit. The encoding quality of retinal motion direction information estimated from the early direction tuning curves was predictive of trial-by-trial variation in initial pursuit directions. These results suggest that the movement directions of open-loop smooth pursuit are guided by the representation of the retinal motion present in the multivariate EEG activity.",

    "abstract": "Modulation of tumor microenvironment is an emerging frontier for new therapeutics. However in meningiomas, the most frequent adult brain tumor, the correlation of microenvironment with tumor phenotype is scarcely studied. We applied a variety of systems biology approaches to bulk tumor transcriptomics to explore the immune environments of both skull base and convexity (hemispheric) meningiomas. We hypothesized that the more benign biology of skull base meningiomas parallels the relative composition and activity of immune cells that oppose tumor growth and/or survival. We firstly applied gene co-expression networks to tumor bulk transcriptomics from 107 meningiomas (derived from 3 independent studies) and found immune processes to be the sole biological mechanism correlated with anatomical location while correcting for tumour grade. We then derived tumor immune cell fractions from bulk transcriptomics data and examined the immune cell-cytokine interactions using a network-based approach. We demonstrate that oncolytic M1 macrophages dominate skull base meningiomas while mast cells, known to play a role in oncogenesis, show greater activity in convexity tumors. Our results are the first to suggest the importance of tumor microenvironment in meningioma biology in the context of anatomic location and immune landscape. These findings may help better inform surgical decision making and yield location-specific therapies through modulation of immune microenvironment.",

    "abstract": "Liability to schizophrenia is inversely correlated with general cognitive ability at both the phenotypic and genetic level. Paradoxically, a modest but consistent positive genetic correlation has been reported between schizophrenia and educational attainment, despite the strong positive genetic correlation between cognitive ability and educational attainment. Here we leverage published GWAS in cognitive ability, education, and schizophrenia to parse biological mechanisms underlying these results. Association analysis based on subsets (ASSET), a pleiotropic meta-analytic technique, allowed jointly associated loci to be identified and characterized. Specifically, we identified subsets of variants associated in the expected (\\\"Concordant\\\") direction across all three phenotypes (i.e., greater risk for schizophrenia, lower cognitive ability, and lower educational attainment); these were contrasted with variants demonstrating the counterintuitive (\\\"Discordant\\\") relationship between education and schizophrenia (i.e., greater risk for schizophrenia and higher educational attainment). ASSET analysis revealed 235 independent loci associated with cognitive ability, education and/or schizophrenia at p<5x10-8. Pleiotropic analysis successfully identified more than 100 loci that were not significant in the input GWASs, and many of these have been validated by larger, more recent single-phenotype GWAS. Leveraging the joint genetic correlations of cognitive ability, education, and schizophrenia, we were able to dissociate two distinct biological mechanisms: early neurodevelopmental pathways that characterize concordant allelic variation, and adulthood synaptic pruning pathways that were linked to the paradoxical positive genetic association between education and schizophrenia. Further, genetic correlation analyses revealed that these mechanisms contribute not only to the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia, but also to the broader biological dimensions that are implicated in both general health outcomes and psychiatric illness.",

    "abstract": "Aside from their roles in the cytoplasm, RNA-interference components have been reported to localize also in the nucleus of human cells. In particular, AGO1 associates with active chromatin and appears to influence global gene expression. However, the mechanistic aspects remain elusive. Here, we identify AGO1 as a paraspeckle component that in combination with the NEAT1 lncRNA maintains 3D genome architecture. We demonstrate that AGO1 interacts with NEAT1 lncRNA and its depletion affects NEAT1 expression and the formation of paraspeckles. By Hi-C analysis in AGO1 knockdown cells, we observed global changes in chromatin organization, including TADs configuration, and A/B compartment mixing. Consistently, distinct groups of genes located within the differential interacting loci showed altered expression upon AGO1 depletion. NEAT1 knockout cells displayed similar changes in TADs and higher-order A/B compartmentalization. We propose that AGO1 in association with NEAT1 lncRNA can act as a scaffold that bridges chromatin and nuclear bodies to regulate genome organization and gene expression in human cells.",

Current methods that analyze individual genotype data for estimating genetic correlation are challenging to scale to large datasets. Methods that analyze summary data, while being computationally efficient, tend to yield estimates of genetic correlation with reduced precision. We propose, SCORE, a randomized method of moments estimator of genetic correlation that is both scalable and accurate. SCORE obtains more precise estimates of genetic correlations relative to summary-statistic methods that can be applied at scale achieving a 50% reduction in standard error relative to LD-score regression (LDSC) and a 26% reduction relative to high-definition likelihood (HDL) (averaged over all simulations). The efficiency of SCORE enables computation of genetic correlations on the UK biobank dataset consisting of {approx} 300K individuals and {approx} 500K SNPs in a few hours (orders of magnitude faster than methods that analyze individual data such as GCTA). Across 780 pairs of traits in 291, 273 unrelated white British individuals in the UK Biobank, SCORE identifies significant genetic correlation between 200 additional pairs of traits over LDSC (beyond the 245 pairs identified by both).",

To enable flexible and efficient access to specific neural populations in the mouse cortex, we collected chromatin accessibility data from individual cells and clustered the single-cell data to identify enhancers specific for cell classes and subclasses. When cloned into adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) and delivered to the brain by retro-orbital injections, these enhancers drive transgene expression in specific cell subclasses in the cortex. We characterize several enhancer viruses in detail to show that they result in labeling of different projection neuron subclasses in mouse cortex, and that one of them can be used to label the homologous projection neuron subclass in human cortical slices. To enable the combinatorial labeling of more than one cell type by enhancer viruses, we developed a three-color Cre-, Flp- and Nigri-recombinase dependent reporter mouse line, Ai213. The delivery of three enhancer viruses driving these recombinases via a single retroorbital injection into a single Ai213 transgenic mouse results in labeling of three different neuronal classes/subclasses in the same brain tissue. This approach combines unprecedented flexibility with specificity for investigation of cell types in the mouse brain and beyond.",

Moreover, we have used this large-scale glycoproteomic data to develop several new visualizations that will prove useful for analyzing intact glycopeptides in future studies.

    "abstract": "BackgroundHorizontal gene transfer is the main source of adaptability for bacteria, through which genes are obtained from different sources including bacteria, archaea, viruses, and eukaryotes. This process promotes the rapid spread of genetic information across lineages, typically in the form of clusters of genes referred to as genomic islands (GIs). Different types of GIs exist, often classified by the content of their cargo genes or their means of integration and mobility. Various computational methods have been devised to detect different types of GIs, but no single method currently is capable of detecting all GIs.\n\nResultsWe propose a method, which we call Shutter Island, that uses a deep learning model (Inception V3, widely used in computer vision) to detect genomic islands. The intrinsic value of deep learning methods lies in their ability to generalize. Via a technique called transfer learning, the model is pre-trained on a large generic dataset and then re-trained on images that we generate to represent genomic fragments. We demonstrate that this image-based approach generalizes better than the existing tools.\n\nConclusionsWe used a deep neural network and an image-based approach to detect the most out of the correct GI predictions made by other tools, in addition to making novel GI predictions. The fact that the deep neural network was retrained on only a limited number of GI datasets and then successfully generalized indicates that this approach could be applied to other problems in the field where data is still lacking or hard to curate.",

    "abstract": "Marine pelagic larvae from throughout the animal kingdom use a hierarchy of environmental cues to identify a suitable benthic habitat on which to settle and metamorphose into the reproductive phase of the life cycle. The majority of larvae are induced to settle by biochemical cues (1) and many species have long been known to preferentially settle in the dark (2). Combined, these data suggest that larval responses to light and biochemical cues may be linked, but this is yet to be explored at the molecular level. Here, we track vertical position of larvae of the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica to show that they descend to the benthos at twilight, by which time they are competent to respond to biochemical cues (3), consistent with them naturally settling in the dark. We then conduct larval settlement assays under three different light regimes (natural day-night, constant dark or constant light), and use transcriptomics on individual larvae to identify candidate molecular pathways underlying the different settlement responses that we observe. We find that constant light prevents larval settlement in response to biochemical cues, likely via actively repressing chemostransduction; this is consistent with the sustained upregulation of a photosensory cryptochrome and two putative inactivators of G-protein signalling in the constant light only. We hypothesise that photo- and chemosensory systems may be hierarchically integrated into ontogeny to regulate larval settlement via nitric oxide (NO) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signalling in this sponge that belongs to one of the earliest branching of the extant animal lineages.\\n\\nSignificance statementIn the ocean, successful recruitment of pelagic larvae into reproductive adult populations enables the survival and connectivity of benthic communities. The majority of invertebrate larvae are induced to settle by biochemical cues, and multiple species preferentially settle in the dark. Here, we explore, for the first time, interactions between light and biochemical cues at behavioural and molecular levels during larval ontogeny in a sponge. We find that light perturbs ontogenetic changes in gene expression and prevents settlement in response to biochemical cues, demonstrating strong interdependencies between photo- and chemosensory systems. Sponges are one of the earliest-branching of the extant animal phyletic lineages, and a valuable comparative model for understanding the origin and evolution of the pelago-benthic life cycle.",

We calculated the narrow-sense heritability of knee pain using Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis (GCTA).\\n\\nResultsWe identified 2 loci that reached genome-wide significance, rs143384 located in the GDF5 (P = 1.32 x 10-12), a gene previously implicated in osteoarthritis, and rs2808772, located near COL27A1 (P = 1.49 x 10-8). These findings were subsequently replicated in independent cohorts and increased in significance in the joint meta-analysis (rs143384: P = 4.64 x 10-18; rs2808772: P -11 = 2.56 x 10-1). The narrow sense heritability of knee pain was 0.08.\\n\\nConclusionIn this first reported genome-wide association meta-analysis of knee pain, we identified and replicated two loci in or near GDF5 and COL27A1 that are associated with knee pain.",

    "abstract": "CTCF is a key insulator-binding protein and mammalian genomes contain numerous CTCF-binding sites (CBSs), many of which are organized in tandem arrays. Here we provide direct evidence that CBSs, if located between enhancers and promoters in the Pcdh and {beta}-globin clusters, function as an enhancer-blocking insulator by forming distinct directional chromatin loops, regardless whether enhancers contain CBS or not. Moreover, computational simulation and experimental capture revealed balanced promoter usage in cell populations and stochastic monoallelic expression in single cells by large arrays of tandem variable CBSs. Finally, gene expression levels are negatively correlated with CBS insulators located between enhancers and promoters on a genome-wide scale. Thus, single CBS insulators ensure proper enhancer insulation and promoter activation while tandem-arrayed CBS insulators determine balanced promoter usage. This finding has interesting implications on the role of topological insulators in 3D genome folding and developmental gene regulation.",

    "abstract": "Social belonging and affiliation are important human drives that impact decision-making and health outcomes. While neural responses to social exclusion are increasingly well-characterized, studies rarely identify whether these responses reflect the affective distress or expectancy violation associated with exclusion. The present study compares neural responses to exclusion and over-inclusion, a similarly unexpected social occurrence that violates fair play expectations, but does not involve rejection, with a focus on implications for models of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) function. In an fMRI adaptation of the Cyberball paradigm with human adolescents 11.1-17.7 years of age (N=69), we employed parametric modulators to examine scaling of neural signal with cumulative exclusion and inclusion events. The use of parametric modulators overcomes arbitrary definitions of condition onsets and offsets imposed on fluid, continuous gameplay. In support of the notion that the dACC plays a role in processing affective distress, this region exhibited greater signal with cumulative exclusion than cumulative inclusion events. However, this difference was partly driven by diminished signal accompanying cumulative inclusion, a finding that does not conform to either affective distress or expectancy violation model predictions. Additionally, we found that signal in the insula and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex scaled uniquely with social exclusion and over-inclusion, respectively, while conjunction analyses revealed that the rostromedial prefrontal cortex and left intraparietal sulcus responded similarly to both conditions. These findings shed light on which neural regions may exhibit patterns of differential sensitivity to exclusion or over-inclusion, as well as those that are more broadly engaged by both types of social interaction.",

Motivated by the need to tune the dynamics and improve the robustness of synthetic gene circuits, biological engineers have proposed various designs that mimic natural molecular feedback control mechanisms. However, practical and predictable implementations have proved challenging because of the complexity of synthesis and analysis of complex biomolecular networks. Here, we analyze and experimentally validate a first synthetic biomolecular controller executed in vitro. The controller is based on the interaction between a sigma and an anti-sigma factor, which ensures that gene expression tracks an externally imposed reference level, and achieves this goal even in the presence of disturbances. Our design relies upon an analog of the well-known principle of integral feedback in control theory. We implement the controller in an Escherichia coli cell-free transcription-translation (TXTL) system, a platform that allows rapid prototyping and implementation. Modeling and theory guide experimental implementation of the controller with well-defined operational predictability.",

    "abstract": "1.Domestication of Atlantic salmon started approximately forty years ago, using both artificial and natural selection strategies. Such selection methods are likely to have imposed distinctive selection signatures on the salmon genome. Therefore, identifying differences in selection signatures may give insights into the mechanism of selection and candidate genes of biological and productive interest. Here, we used two complementary haplotype-based statistics, the within-population integrated Haplotype Score test (|iHS|) and the cross-population Extended Haplotype Homozygosity test (XP-EHH) to compare selection signatures in four populations of Atlantic salmon with a common genetic origin. Using |iHS| we found 24, 14, 16 and 26 genomic regions under selection in Pop-A, Pop-B, Pop-C, and Pop-D, respectively. While using the XP-EHH test we identified 27, 25 and 15 potential selection regions in Pop-A/Pop-B, Pop-A/Pop-C and Pop-A/Pop-D, respectively. These genomic regions harbor important genes such igf1r and sh3rf1 which have been associated with growth related traits in other species. Our results contribute to the detection of candidate genes of interest and help to understand the evolutionary and biological mechanisms for controlling complex traits under selection in Atlantic salmon.",

    "abstract": "Though a growing body of preclinical and translational research is illuminating a biological basis for resilience to stress, little is known about the genetic basis of psychological resilience in humans. We conducted genomewide association studies (GWAS) of self-assessed (by questionnaire) and outcome-based (incident mental disorders from pre- to post-deployment) resilience among European (EUR) ancestry soldiers in the Army Study To Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (STARRS). Self-assessed resilience (N=11,492) was found to have significant common-variant heritability (h2=0.162, se=0.050, p=5.37e-4), and to be significantly negatively genetically correlated with neuroticism (rg= -0.388, p=0.0092). GWAS results from the EUR soldiers revealed a genomewide significant locus (4 SNPs in LD; top SNP: rs4260523, p=5.654e-09) on an intergenic region on Chr 4 upstream from DCLK2 (Doublecortin-Like Kinase 2), a member of the doublecortin (DCX) family of kinases that promote survival and regeneration of injured neurons. A second gene, KLHL36 (Kelch Like Family Member 36) was detected at gene-wise genomewide significance (p=1.89e-06). A polygenic risk score derived from the self-assessed resilience GWAS was not significantly associated with outcome-based resilience. In very preliminary results, genomewide significant association with outcome-based resilience was found for one locus (top SNP: rs12580015) on Chr 12 downstream from SLC15A5 (solute carrier family 15 member 5) in the small group (N=581) of subjects exposed to the highest level of deployment stress. The further study of genetic determinants of resilience has the potential to illuminate the molecular bases of stress-related psychopathology and potentially point to new avenues for therapeutic intervention.",

Our combined approach allowed for visualization of the small subunit as it assembled and revealed that with the exception of key helices in the platform domain, all other 16S rRNA domains were able to fold even in the absence of Era. Notably, the maturing particles did not stall while waiting for the platform domain to mature and instead re-routed their folding pathway to enable concerted maturation of other structural motifs spanning multiple rRNA domains. We also found that binding of Era to the mature 30S subunit destabilized helix 44 and the decoding center preventing binding of YjeQ, another assembly factor. This work establishes Eras role in ribosome assembly and suggests new roles in maintaining ribosome homeostasis.",

Our analysis reveals a low-dimensional structure in the space of human odor perception, with the receptor groups as the bases to represent major features in the perceptual odor space.

One example is the importance of the free-living survival stage of certain pathogens, and especially is cases where they are transmitted indirectly between hosts through an environmental reservoir intermediate. In this study, we develop an integrated, broadly applicable mathematical method to examine diseases fitting this description--the waterborne, abiotic and other indirectly transmitted (W.A.I.T.) infection framework. To demonstrate its utility, we construct realistic models of two very different epidemic scenarios: cholera in a densely populated setting with limited access to clean drinking water and hepatitis C virus in an urban setting of injection-drug users. Using these two exemplars, we find that the W.A.I.T. model fortifies the centrality of reservoir dynamics in the \"sit and wait\" infection strategy, and provides a way to simulate a diverse set of intervention strategies.",

    "abstract": "Airway microbial-microbial interaction plays an important role in chronic airway inflammatory diseases such as asthma. Moraxella is widely regarded as a human respiratory tract pathogen. We aimed to investigate the interactions among Moraxella, Moraxellaceae (to which Moraxella belongs) and the airway microbiome in asthma. Induced sputum samples were obtained from 116 asthma patients and 29 healthy individuals, and the bacterial/fungal communities were profiled using 16S rRNA and ITS1 DNA gene sequencing. We found that asthma patients harboured significantly greater airway bacterial and fungal -diversity than that of healthy individuals. Moraxellaceae, Moraxella and Moraxella otu19 (bacteria), and Schizophyllaceae, Polyporaceae, Aspergillus, Schizophyllum and Candida (fungi) were increased in the airway of asthma. Moreover, Moraxellaceae, Schizophyllaceae, Polyporaceae and Candida were positively associated with airway fungal -diversity. Correlation networks revealed Moraxellaceae and Moraxella as microbial \\\"hubs\\\" in asthma that had significant negative connections with multiple bacterial communities, such as Leptotrichiaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, Porphyromonadaceae, Prevotella, Veillonella, Rothia and Leptotrichia, but positive interactions with fungal communities such as Schizophyllaceae, Polyporaceae, Candida and Meyerozyma. Together, our finding revealed an altered microbiome and complex microbial-microbial interactions in the airway of asthma. Moraxellaceae and Moraxella showed significant interactions with the airway mycobiome, providing potential insights into the novel pathogenic mechanisms of asthma.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEWith the advent of culture-independent techniques, growing evidence suggests that the airway microbiome is closely correlated with chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma. The complex microbial-microbial interaction exists in the airways of both healthy individuals and patients with respiratory diseases, which is of great significance for the pathogenesis and disease progression of asthma. In this study, we evaluated the airway dysbiosis in asthma patients, described the interaction between Moraxellaceae, Moraxella and airway bacterial/fungal communities, and it contributes to further understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of asthma.",

    "abstract": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae kinesin-5 Cin8 displays unconventional biochemical behavior including bidirectional motility and ability to bind multiple motor domains per {beta} tubulin dimer in the microtubule lattice. Previous research suggested that a large loop-8 insert near the microtubule binding interface of Cin8 was critical for its noncanonical microtubule binding behavior. Here we utilized mutagenesis, thermodynamic, and kinetic assays to further understand the mechanism for how this loop-8 insert promotes super-stoichiometric microtubule binding in Cin8. This loop-8 insert that interrupts the conserved {beta}5a/b hairpin was swapped between Cin8, Eg5 (KIF11, a human kinesin-5) and Kip1 (another S. cerevisiae kinesin-5). Cin8 with the loop-8 insert from Eg5 (Cin8-EL8) binds one motor per tubulin dimer, whereas Eg5 with the loop-8 insert from Cin8 (Eg5-CL8) binds approximately 2-4 motors per tubulin dimer. Eg5-CL8 bound the canonical and noncanonical sites on the microtubule lattice with weakened oligomerization between motors, while Cin8-EL8 showed only canonical site binding. These results demonstrate that the large loop-8 insert in Cin8 is necessary and sufficient to promote noncanonical microtubule binding behavior.",

    "abstract": "Reverse gyrase (RG) is the only protein found ubiquitously in hyperthermophilic organisms, but absent from mesophiles. As such, its simple presence or absence allows us to deduce information about the optimal growth temperature of long-extinct organisms, even as far as the last universal common ancestor of extant life (LUCA). The growth environment and gene content of the LUCA has long been a source of debate in which RG often features. In an attempt to settle this debate, we carried out an exhaustive search for RG proteins, generating the largest RG dataset to date. Comprising 376 sequences, our dataset allows for phylogenetic reconstructions of RG with unprecedented size and detail. These RG phylogenies are strikingly different from those of known LUCA-encoded proteins, even when using the same set of species. Unlike LUCA-encoded proteins, RG does not form monophyletic archaeal and bacterial clades, suggesting RG emergence after the formation of these domains, and/or significant horizontal gene transfer. Even more strikingly, the branch lengths separating archaeal and bacterial groups are very short, inconsistent with the tempo of evolution from the time of the LUCA. Despite this, phylogenies limited to archaeal RG resolve most archaeal phyla, suggesting predominantly vertical evolution since the time of the last archaeal ancestor. In contrast, bacterial RG indicates emergence after the last bacterial ancestor followed by significant horizontal transfer. Taken together, these results suggest a non-hyperthermophilic LUCA and bacterial ancestor, with hyperthermophily emerging early in the evolution of the archaeal and bacterial domains.",

Our aim was therefore to address the fundamental question whether causal variants for blood lipids are shared across populations.\\n\\nA polygenic score based on established LDL-cholesterol-associated loci from European discovery samples had consistent effects on serum levels in samples from the UK, Uganda and Greek population isolates (correlation coefficient r=0.23 to 0.28 per LDL standard deviation, p<1.9x10-14). Trans-ethnic genetic correlations between European ancestry, Chinese and Japanese cohorts did not differ significantly from 1 for HDL, LDL and triglycerides. In each study, >60% of major lipid loci displayed evidence of replication with one exception. There was evidence for an effect on serum levels in the Ugandan samples for only 10% of major triglyceride loci. The PRS was only weakly associated in this group (r=0.06, SE=0.013). We establish trans-ethnic colocalization as a method to distinguish shared from population-specific trait loci.\\n\\nOur results provide evidence for high levels of consistency of genetic associations for cholesterol biomarkers across populations. However, we also demonstrate that the degree of shared causal genetic architecture can be population-, trait- and locus-specific.

    "abstract": "Social complexity may drive complexity in communicative systems due to an individual's need to navigate unpredictable interactions with multiple conspecifics. Cooperative breeding primates (marmosets and tamarins; family: Callitrichidae) live in groups with moderate to high reproductive skew, particularly in females, whereby sexually mature individuals are frequently prevented from breeding. Remarkably, dispersal from natal groups is not stereotyped upon reaching reproductive maturity. Individuals are often observed remaining in their natal groups until the same-sex breeder in their group or a neighboring group dies, experiencing hormonal reproductive suppression, aggression, and limited access to potential mates. Here we examined whether emperor tamarins (Saguinus imperator) might use vocal signals to reduce dispersal risks and maximize the likelihood of attaining a breeding position. Using six consecutive years of mark-recapture data, we showed that sexually mature non-breeders (herein \\\"secondary breeders\\\") are more likely to leave their groups from one year to the next than sexually mature breeders (\\\"primary breeders\\\"). This confirmed that, unlike primary breeders who do not need to disperse in order to reproduce, secondary breeders are choosing to accept the risks associated with dispersal and emigrating from their natal groups. We used neural networks to classify vocalizations according to individual breeding status, and conducted a series of playback experiments which demonstrated that tamarins discriminated between the calls of primary and secondary breeders. Our data support the hypotheses that secondary breeders disperse to increase mating opportunities and use vocalizations to signal their availability to potential mates. This species of cooperative breeder appears to use vocalization to navigate its social and reproductive systems, minimizing risks of dispersal and in turn increasing the likelihood of reproductive success. This research has important implications for our understanding of sexual signaling, partner choice, and reproductive success in cooperative breeders.",

    "abstract": "Differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells into macrophages is accompanied by increased PU.1 concentration and increasing cell cycle length, culminating in cell cycle arrest. Induction of PU.1 expression in a cultured myeloid cell line expressing low PU.1 concentration results in decreased levels of mRNA encoding ATP-Citrate Lyase (ACL) and cell cycle arrest. ACL is an essential enzyme for generating acetyl-CoA, a key metabolite for the first step in fatty acid synthesis as well as for histone acetylation. We hypothesized that ACL may play a role in cell cycle regulation in the myeloid lineage. In this study, we found that acetyl-CoA or acetate supplementation was sufficient to rescue cell cycle progression in cultured BN cells treated with an ACL inhibitor or induced for PU.1 expression. Acetyl-CoA supplementation was also sufficient to rescue cell cycle progression in BN cells treated with a fatty acid synthase (FASN) inhibitor. We demonstrated that acetyl-CoA was utilized in both fatty acid synthesis and histone acetylation pathways to promote proliferation. Finally, we found that Acly mRNA transcript levels decrease during normal macrophage differentiation from bone marrow precursors. Our results suggest that regulation of ACL activity is a potentially important point of control for cell cycle regulation in the myeloid lineage.",

Here, via a precise analysis of the primacy and recency effects in human psychophysical experiments, we propose that stable and flexible coding take distinct roles of retaining and updating information in working memory, and that their combination induces serial-position effects spontaneously. We found that stable encoding retains memory to induce the primacy effect, while flexible encoding used for learning new inputs induces the recency effect. A model simulation based on human data, confirmed that a neural network with both flexible and stable synapses could reproduce the major characteristics of serial-position effects. Our new prediction, that the control of resource allocation by flexible-stable coding balance can modulate memory performance in sequence-specific manner, was supported by pre-cued memory performance data in humans.",

    "abstract": "The interplay between the immune system and tumor progression is well recognized. However, current human breast cancer immunophenotyping studies are mostly focused on primary tumors with metastatic breast cancer lesions remaining largely understudied. To address this gap, we examined exome-capture RNA sequencing data from 50 primary breast tumors (PBTs) and their patient-matched metastatic tumors (METs) in brain, ovary, bone and gastrointestinal tract. We used gene expression signatures as surrogates for tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and compared TIL patterns in PBTs and METs. Enrichment analysis and deconvolution methods both revealed that METs have a significantly lower abundance of total immune cells, including CD8+ T cells, regulatory T cells and dendritic cells. An exception was M2-like macrophages, which were significantly higher in METs across the organ sites examined. Multiplex immunohistochemistry results were consistent with data from the in-silico analysis and showed increased macrophages in METs. We confirmed the finding of a significant reduction in immune cells in brain (BRM) METs by pathologic assessment of TILs in a set of 49 patient-matched pairs of PBT/BRMs. These findings indicate that METs have an overall lower infiltration of immune cells relative to their matched PBTs, possibly due to immune escape. RNAseq analysis suggests that the relative levels of M2-like macrophages are increased in METs, and their potential role in promoting breast cancer metastasis warrants further study.",
