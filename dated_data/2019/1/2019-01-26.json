    "abstract": "MotivationHistorically, gene expression has been shown to be the most informative data for drug response prediction. Recent evidence suggests that integrating additional omics can improve the prediction accuracy which raises the question of how to integrate the additional omics. Regardless of the integration strategy, clinical utility and translatability are crucial. Thus, we reasoned a multi-omics approach combined with clinical datasets would improve drug response prediction and clinical relevance.\n\nResultsWe propose MOLI, a Multi-Omics Late Integration method based on deep neural networks. MOLI takes somatic mutation, copy number aberration, and gene expression data as input, and integrates them for drug response prediction. MOLI uses type-specific encoding subnetworks to learn features for each omics type, concatenates them into one representation and optimizes this representation via a combined cost function consisting of a triplet loss and a binary cross-entropy loss. The former makes the representations of responder samples more similar to each and different from the non-responders, and the latter makes this representation predictive of the response values. We validate MOLI on in vitro and in vivo datasets for five chemotherapy agents and two targeted therapeutics. Compared to state-of-the-art single-omics and early integration multi-omics methods, MOLI achieves higher prediction accuracy in external validations. Moreover, a significant improvement in MOLIs performance is observed for targeted drugs when training on a pan-drug input, i.e. using all the drugs with the same target compared to training only on drug-specific inputs. MOLIs high predictive power suggests it may have utility in precision oncology.\n\nAvailability of the implemented codeshttps://github.com/hosseinshn/MOLI\n\nContactccollins@prostatecentre.com and ester@cs.sfu.ca",

    "abstract": "Identifying chromatin domains (CDs) from high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data is currently a central problem in genome research. Here we present a unified algorithm, Multi-CD, which infers CDs at various genomic scales by leveraging the information from Hi-C. By integrating a model of the chromosome from polymer physics, statistical physics-based clustering analysis, and Bayesian inference, Multi-CD identifies the CDs that best represent the global pattern of correlation manifested in Hi-C. The multi-scale intra-chromosomal structures compared across different cell types allow us to glean the principles of chromatin organization: (i) Sub-TADs, TADs, and meta-TADs constitute a robust hierarchical structure. (ii) The assemblies of compartments and TAD-based domains are governed by different organizational principles. (iii) Sub-TADs are the common building blocks of chromosome architecture. CDs obtained from Multi-CD applied to Hi-C data enable a quantitative and comparative analysis of chromosome organization in different cell types, providing glimpses into structure-function relationship in genome.",

Indeed, symbiont strain diversity has long assumed to be restricted in intracellular bacteria associated with animals. Here, we sequenced the metagenomes and metatranscriptomes of 18 Bathymodiolus mussel individuals from four species, covering their known distribution range at deep-sea hydrothermal vents in the Atlantic. We show that as many as 16 strains of intracellular, sulfur-oxidizing symbionts coexist in individual Bathymodiolus mussels. Co-occurring symbiont strains differed extensively in key metabolic functions, such as the use of energy and nutrient sources, electron acceptors and viral defense mechanisms. Most strain-specific genes were expressed, highlighting their adaptive potential. We show that fine-scale diversity is pervasive in Bathymodiolus symbionts, and hypothesize that it may be widespread in low-cost symbioses where the environment, not the host, feeds the symbionts.",

    "abstract": "A growing number of studies indicate that mRNAs and long ncRNAs can affect protein populations by assembling dynamic ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules. These phase separated molecular  sponges, stabilized by quinary (transient and weak) interactions, control proteins involved in numerous biological functions. Retroviruses such as HIV-1 form by self-assembly when their genomic RNA (gRNA) traps Gag and GagPol polyprotein precursors. Infectivity requires extracellular budding of the particle followed by maturation, an ordered processing of ~2400 Gag and ~120 GagPol by viral protease (PR). This leads to a condensed gRNA-NCp7 nucleocapsid and a CAp24-self-assembled capsid surrounding the RNP. The choreography by which all of these components dynamically interact during virus maturation is one of the missing milestones to fully depict the HIV life cycle. Here, we describe how HIV-1 has evolved a dynamic RNP granule with successive weak-strong-moderate quinary NC-gRNA networks during the sequential processing of the GagNC domain. We also reveal two palindromic RNA-binding triads on NC, KxxFxxQ and QxxFxxK, that provide quinary NC-gRNA interactions. Consequently, the nucleocapsid complex appears properly aggregated for capsid reassembly and reverse transcription, mandatory processes for viral infectivity. We show that PR is sequestered within this RNP and drives its maturation/condensation within minutes, this process being most effective at the end of budding. We anticipate such findings will stimulate further investigations of quinary interactions and emergent mechanisms in crowded environments throughout the wide and growing array of RNP granules.",

    "abstract": "MotivationSame-species contamination detection is an important quality control step in genetic data analysis. Compared with widely discussed cross-species contamination, same-species contamination is more challenging to detect, and there is a scarcity of methods to detect and correct for this quality control issue. Same-species contamination may be due to contamination by lab technicians or samples from other contributors. Here, we introduce a novel machine learning algorithm to detect same species contamination in next generation sequence data using support vector machines. Our approach uniquely detects such contamination using variant calling information stored in the variant call format (VCF) files (either DNA or RNA), and importantly can differentiate between same species contamination and mixtures of tumor and normal cells.\n\nMethodsIn the first stage of our approach, a change-point detection method is used to identify copy number variations or copy number aberrations (CNVs or CNAs) for filtering prior to testing for contamination. Next, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data is used to test for same species contamination using a support vector machine model. Based on the assumption that alternative allele frequencies in next generation sequencing follow the beta-binomial distribution, the deviation parameter {rho} is estimated by maximum likelihood method. All features of a radial basis function (RBF) kernel support vector machine (SVM) are generated using either publicly available or private training data. Lastly, the generated SVM is applied in the test data to detect contamination. If training data is not available, a default RBF kernel SVM model is used.\n\nResultsWe demonstrate the potential of our approach using simulation experiments, creating datasets with varying levels of contamination. The datasets combine, in silico, exome sequencing data of DNA from two lymphoblastoid cell lines (NA12878 and NA10855). We generated VCF files using variants identified in these data, and then evaluated the power and false positive rate of our approach to detect same species contamination. Our simulation experiments show that our method can detect levels of contamination as low as 5% with reasonable false positive rates. Results in real data have sensitivity above 99.99% and specificity at 90.24%, even in the presence of DNA degradation that has similar features to contaminated samples. Additionally, the approach can identify the difference between mixture of tumor-normal cells and contamination. We provide an R software implementation of our approach using the defcon()function in the vanquish: Variant Quality Investigation Helper R package on CRAN.",

    "abstract": "Illumina sequencing allows rapid, cheap and accurate whole genome bacterial analyses, but short reads (<300 bp) do not usually enable complete genome assembly. Long read sequencing greatly assists with resolving complex bacterial genomes, particularly when combined with short-read Illumina data (hybrid assembly). However, it is not clear how different long-read sequencing methods impact on assembly accuracy. Relative automation of the assembly process is also crucial to facilitating high-throughput complete bacterial genome reconstruction, avoiding multiple bespoke filtering and data manipulation steps. In this study, we compared hybrid assemblies for 20 bacterial isolates, including two reference strains, using Illumina sequencing and long reads from either Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) or from SMRT Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) sequencing platforms. We chose isolates from the Enterobacteriaceae family, as these frequently have highly plastic, repetitive genetic structures and complete genome reconstruction for these species is relevant for a precise understanding of the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance. We de novo assembled genomes using the hybrid assembler Unicycler and compared different read processing strategies. Both strategies facilitate high-quality genome reconstruction. Combining ONT and Illumina reads fully resolved most genomes without additional manual steps, and at a lower consumables cost per isolate in our setting. Automated hybrid assembly is a powerful tool for complete and accurate bacterial genome assembly.\n\nIMPACT STATEMENTIllumina short-read sequencing is frequently used for tasks in bacterial genomics, such as assessing which species are present within samples, checking if specific genes of interest are present within individual isolates, and reconstructing the evolutionary relationships between strains. However, while short-read sequencing can reveal significant detail about the genomic content of bacterial isolates, it is often insufficient for assessing genomic structure: how different genes are arranged within genomes, and particularly which genes are on plasmids - potentially highly mobile components of the genome frequently carrying antimicrobial resistance elements. This is because Illumina short reads are typically too short to span repetitive structures in the genome, making it impossible to accurately reconstruct these repetitive regions. One solution is to complement Illumina short reads with long reads generated with SMRT Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) or Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing platforms. Using this approach, called  hybrid assembly, we show that we can automatically fully reconstruct complex bacterial genomes of Enterobacteriaceae isolates in the majority of cases (best-performing method: 17/20 isolates). In particular, by comparing different methods we find that using the assembler Unicycler with Illumina and ONT reads represents a low-cost, high-quality approach for reconstructing bacterial genomes using publicly available software.\n\nDATA SUMMARYRaw sequencing data and assemblies have been deposited in NCBI under BioProject Accession PRJNA422511 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA422511).

    "abstract": "Schistosomiasis is a waterborne, infectious disease with high morbidity and significant economic burdens affecting more than 250 million people globally. Disease control has, with notable success, for decades focused on drug treatment of infected human populations, but a recent paradigm shift now entails moving from control to elimination. To achieve this ambitious goal more sensitive diagnostic tools are needed to monitor progress towards transmission interruption in the environment, especially in low-intensity infection areas. We report on the development of an environmental DNA (eDNA) based tool to efficiently detect DNA traces of the parasite Schistosoma mansoni directly in the aquatic environment, where the non-human part of the parasite life cycle occurs. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the successful detection of S. mansoni in freshwater samples using aquatic eDNA. True eDNA was detected in as few as 10 cercariae/L water in laboratory experiments. The field applicability of the method was tested at known transmission sites in Kenya, where comparison of schistosome detection by conventional snail surveys (snail collection and cercariae shedding) with eDNA (water samples) showed 71% agreement between the methods. The eDNA method furthermore detected schistosome presence at two additional sites where snail shedding failed, demonstrating a higher sensitivity of eDNA sampling. We conclude that eDNA provides a promising new tool to significantly improve the environmental surveillance of S. mansoni. Given the proper method and guideline development, eDNA could become an essential future component of the schistosomiasis control tool box needed to achieve the goal of elimination.\n\nSignificanceAccurate detection and delineation of schistosomiasis transmission sites will be vital in on-going efforts to control and ultimately eliminate one of the most neglected tropical parasitic diseases affecting more than 250 million people worldwide. Conventional methods to detect parasites in the environment are cumbersome and have low sensitivity. We therefore developed an environmental DNA (eDNA) based method for schistosome detection in aquatic environments. Aquatic eDNA showed higher sensitivity than conventional snail surveys. We conclude that eDNA is a promising non-invasive and sensitive tool for environmental surveillance of schistosomiasis transmission. As the efforts and aims to control the disease are transitioning towards complete transmission interruption, this could be the robust and cost-effective surveillance tool needed in the \"end game\" of schistosomiasis.",

These characteristics are preferentially linked to GBM cancer stem cells (GSCs), but how GSCs maintain their stemness is incompletely understood and the subject of intense investigation. Here, we identify a novel signaling loop that induces and maintains GSCs. This loop consists of an atypical metalloproteinase, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-like protein decysin 1 (ADAMDEC1), secreted by GSCs. ADAMDEC1 rapidly solubilizes fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) to stimulate FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) expressed on GSCs. This signaling axis induces upregulation of Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) that regulates ADAMDEC1 expression, creating a positive feedback loop. Genetic or pharmacological targeting of components of this axis attenuates self-renewal and tumor growth. These findings reveal a new signaling axis for GSC maintenance and highlight ADAMDEC1 and FGFR1 as potential therapeutic targets in GBM.\n\nStatement of SignificanceCancer stem cells (CSC) drive tumor growth in many cancers including glioblastoma.

This diversity makes them ideal models to test existing theories on the evolution of alternation between generations, and to examine correlations between life cycle and reproductive life history traits. In this study, we investigate the dynamics of trait evolution for four life-history traits: life cycle, sexual system, level of gamete dimorphism and gamete parthenogenetic capacity. We assign states to up to 70 species in a multi-gene phylogeny of brown algae, and use maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses of correlated evolution, taking phylogeny into account, to test for correlations between life history traits and sexual systems, and to investigate the sequence of trait acquisition. Our analyses are consistent with the prediction that diploid growth may evolve because it allows the complementation of deleterious mutations, and that haploid sex determination is ancestral in relation to diploid sex determination. However, the idea that increased zygotic and diploid growth is associated with increased sexual dimorphism is not supported by our analysis. Finally, it appears that in the brown algae isogamous species evolved from anisogamous ancestors.",

    "abstract": "Targeted cancer therapy is based on exploiting selective dependencies of tumor cells. By leveraging recent large-scale genomic profiling and functional screening of cancer cell lines we identified Werner syndrome helicase (WRN) as a novel specific vulnerability of microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) cancer cells. MSI, caused by defective mismatch repair is frequently detected in human malignancies, in particular in colorectal, endometrial and gastric cancers. We demonstrate that WRN inactivation selectively impairs the viability of MSI-H but not microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal and endometrial cancer cell lines. In MSI-H cells, WRN loss results in the emergence of chromosome breaks, chromatin bridges and micronuclei highlighting defective genome integrity. WRN variants harboring mutations abrogating the ATPase function of WRN helicase fail to rescue the viability phenotype of WRN-depleted MSI-H colorectal cells. Our study suggests that pharmacological inhibition of WRN helicase function might represent a novel opportunity to develop a targeted therapy for MSI-H cancers.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLike many bacteria, Vibrio cholerae, which causes fatal cholera, deploys a harpoon-like Type VI Secretion System (T6SS) to compete against other microbes in environmental and host settings. The T6SS punctures adjacent cells and delivers toxic effector proteins that are harmless to bacteria carrying cognate immunity factors. Only four effector/immunity pairs encoded on one large and three auxiliary gene clusters have been characterized from largely clonal, patient-derived strains of V. cholerae.\n\nResultsWe sequenced two dozen V. cholerae strain genomes from diverse sources and developed a novel and adaptable bioinformatic tool based on Hidden Markov Models. We identified two new T6SS auxiliary gene clusters; one, Aux 5, is described here. Four Aux 5 loci are present in the host strain, each with an atypical effector/immunity gene organization. Structural prediction of the putative effector indicated it is a lipase, which we name TleV1 (Type VI lipase effector Vibrio, TleV1). Ectopic TleV1 expression induced toxicity in E. coli, which was rescued by co-expression of the TleV1 immunity factor. A clinical V. cholerae reference strain expressing the Aux 5 cluster used TleV1 to lyse its parental strain upon contact via its T6SS but was unable to kill parental cells expressing TleV1s immunity factor.\n\nConclusionWe developed a novel bioinformatic method and identified new T6SS gene clusters in V. cholerae. We also showed the TleV1 toxin is delivered in a T6SS-manner by V. cholerae and can lyse other bacterial cells. Our web-based tool may be modified to identify additional novel T6SS genomic loci in diverse bacterial species.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe chemokine MIP-3 (CCL20) binds to CCR6 found on immature dendritic cells. DNA vaccines fusing MIP-3 to melanoma-associated antigens have shown improved efficacy and immunogenicity in the B16F10 model. To optimize the therapy, our laboratory has added agents designed to overcome immunoregulatory mechanisms of the tumor microenvironment. Here, we report that the combination of type-I interferon therapy (IFN) with 5-Aza-2-deoxycitidine (Aza) profoundly enhanced the therapeutic anti-melanoma efficacy of a MIP-3-Gp100-Trp2 DNA vaccine.\n\nMethodsThe current studies utilize the B16F10 syngeneic mouse melanoma model. The vaccine is administered intramuscularly (i.m.) followed by i.m. electroporation. Vaccinations are given thrice at one-week intervals beginning day 5 with CpG adjuvant given two days later as noted. Aza is given i.p. at 1mg/kg on days 5 and 12. IFN therapy is given in a series of one high followed by three low doses, beginning on days 5 and 12. Tumor sizes, growth, and survival were all assessed. Tumor microenvironment gene expression levels were explored by qRT-PCR. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were assessed by stimulating the purified lymphocyte fraction of tumors with vaccine antigens followed by intracellular cytokine staining flow cytometry.\n\nResultsWe demonstrate that the addition of IFN and Aza treatments to mice vaccinated with the MIP-3-Gp100-Trp2 vaccine has led to significantly reduced tumor burden and overall increases in mouse survival, increasing median survival by 39% over vaccine and 86% over controls. Importantly, this increase in efficacy was dependent on the presence of all three components: vaccine, IFN, and Aza. The addition of Aza and IFN to the vaccine increased T-cell tumor infiltration and altered the proportion of CD8+T-cells. Also, IFN and vaccine induced durable changes in IFN-stimulated gene transcription.\n\nConclusionsEfficient targeting of antigen to immature dendritic cells with a chemokine-fusion vaccine offers a potential alternative approach to classic and dendritic cell based vaccines currently undergoing clinical investigation. Combining this approach with IFN and Aza combination treatment significantly improved vaccine efficacy, with efficacy correlating with changes in TILs and in IFN -stimulated gene expression. Further potential therapy optimization currently undergoing investigation offers promise for this line of investigation to become a novel melanoma therapy.",

    "abstract": "Denitrifiers have been shown to vary in abundance and diversity across the environmental gradients; however, the factors that determine the type and magnitude of the response of the denitrifier communities remain unclear. In order to reveal the effects of alkaline mine drainage (AlkMD) on the denitrifier community composition and diversity maintenance mechanism in a tailings reservoir, we examined the diversity patterns and adaptation mechanisms of different denitrifier communities in Shibahe copper tailings water in Zhongtiaoshan, China. The results showed that the -diversity of Proteobacteria and the nosZI-bearing denitrifier community in downstream seeping water (SDSW) were the highest, while those in the upstream tailings water (STW1) were the lowest. The highest nirS and nirK-bearing denitrifier community -diversity were measured in STW1, and the lowest in STW3. The community dissimilarity of the denitrifier communities was strongly correlated with environment parameters, but the factors varied in different groups. The Proteobacteria community was correlated strongly with nitrate (NO3-); the nirS and nirK-bearing denitrifier communities were correlated strongly with pH, total carbon (TC), NO3- and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+), and the nosZI-bearing denitrifier community was correlated strongly with total organic carbon (TOC), dissolved oxygen (DO), NO3-, electroconductibility (EC) and spatial distance (PCNM1). Our results indicated that environmental changes were valuable index reflecting variations in denitrifier community composition in AlkMD. Additionally, the findings in this study are helpful in understanding the relationship between the microbial community composition changes and functional adaptation in different ecosystems.\n\nIMPORTANCEMetal mine tailings pond is an important site polluted by heavy metals and nitrogen, and excess nitrogen is mainly removed by microorganisms through denitrification. Although many studies have reported that Proteobacteria is the main denitrifying bacteria, and nirS, nirK and nosZ-bearing denitrifiers are three key functional groups in denitrification process. However, less is known of their response to discharge of alkaline copper tailings wastewater (AlkMD). AlkMD exerts an adverse impact on composition and structure of denitrifying bacteria community. The change of nitrogen and carbon concentration along the flow direction of wastewater resulted in the change of denitrifying bacteria community diversity pattern, that is to say, environmental filtering force drove the denitrifier community structure in this highly polluted ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Graphene oxide (GO) is an oxidized form of graphene that is relatively cheap and easy to produce. This has heralded its widespread use in a range of industries, with its likelihood of release into the environment increasing accordingly. In pure culture, GO has been shown to influence bacteria and fungi, but its effects on environmental microbial communities remain poorly characterized, despite the important ecosystem services that these organisms underpin. Here, we characterized the effects of GO and graphite, over time and at three concentrations (1 ng, 1 {micro}g and 1 mg kg dry soil-1), on soil bacterial and fungal diversity using 16S rRNA and ITS2 gene amplicon sequencing. Graphite was included as a reference material as it is widely distributed in the environment. Neither GO or graphite had significant effects on the alpha diversity of microbial communities. The composition of bacterial and fungal communities, however, was significantly influenced by GO and graphite. These effects were equally apparent between doses and varied over time. Predicted KEGG pathways and fungal guild structures were not significantly influenced by the treatments. Our study demonstrates that GO can influence soil microbial diversity, even at parts-per-trillion concentration, which is equivalent to the rates of release predicted for similar nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes.\n\nImportanceGraphene oxide is a nanomaterial with broad and expanding industrial applications. Some evidence indicates that it can influence the growth of microorganisms, many of which support important ecosystem services, such as the provision of food and clean water. The amount of graphene oxide currently entering soils is not known but is likely to be similar to other nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes (i.e. parts-per-trillion to parts-per-billion per year). In this study, we demonstrate that graphene oxide added to soil at these concentrations (or higher) can alter the composition of bacterial and fungal communities. Nonetheless, we found that these changes were of similar magnitude to those associated with the addition of graphite, which is common and occurs naturally in soils. Further research is recommended to determine whether the changes in microbial community composition that we have shown can be induced by graphene oxide, have deleterious consequences for soil health.",

    "abstract": "The DivJ-DivK-PleC signaling system of Caulobacter crescentus is a signaling network that regulates polar development and the cell cycle. This system is conserved in related bacteria, including the sister genus Brevundimonas. Previous studies had shown unexpected phenotypic differences between the C. crescentus divK mutant and the analogous mutant of Brevundimonas subvibrioides, but further characterization was not performed. Here, phenotypic assays analyzing motility, adhesion, and pilus production (the latter characterized by a newly discovered bacteriophage) revealed that divJ and pleC mutants have mostly similar phenotypes as their C. crescentus homologs, but divK mutants maintain largely opposite phenotypes than expected. Suppressor mutations of the B. subvibrioides divK motility defect were involved in cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP) signaling, including the diguanylate cyclase dgcB, and cleD which is hypothesized to affect flagellar function in a c-di-GMP dependent fashion. However, the screen did not identify the diguanylate cyclase pleD. Disruption of pleD in B. subvibrioides caused hypermotility in wild-type, but not in the divK background. Analysis of c-di-GMP levels in these strains revealed incongruities between c-di-GMP levels and displayed phenotypes with a notable result that suppressor mutations altered phenotypes but had little impact on c-di-GMP levels in the divK background. Conversely, when c-di-GMP levels were artificially manipulated, alterations of c-di-GMP levels in the divK strain had minimal impact on phenotypes. These results suggest that DivK performs a critical function in the integration of c-di-GMP signaling into the B. subvibrioides cell cycle.\n\nImportanceCyclic-di-GMP signaling is one of the most broadly conserved signaling systems in bacteria, but there is little understanding of how this system directly affects the physiology of the organism. In C. crescentus, c-di-GMP has been integrated into the developmental cell cycle, but there is increasing evidence that environmental factors can impact this system as well. The research presented here suggests that developmental signaling could impact physiological Processes in c-di-GMP dependent and independent ways. This hints that the integration of these signaling networks could be more complex than previously hypothesized, which could have a bearing on the larger field of c-di-GMP signaling. In addition, this work further examines how much models developed in one organism can be extrapolated to related organisms.",

Here we analyzed the effects of srl overexpression on phenotype and on gene expression in tko25t, a recessive bang-sensitive mutant with a global defect in oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in a deficiency of mitochondrial protein synthesis. In contrast to previous reports, we found only minimal effects of substantial overexpression of srl throughout development, on the expression of a representative set of both mtDNA- and nuclear-encoded OXPHOS- related transcripts, both in tko25t mutant flies and heterozygous controls. Sex and genetic background appeared to influence the expression of the tested genes, but srl overexpression or tko25t itself did not have clear-cut or systematic effects thereon.

    "abstract": "Enterococcus faecalis is a human intestinal pathobiont with intrinsic and acquired resistance to many antibiotics, including vancomycin. Nature provides a diverse and virtually untapped repertoire of bacterial viruses, or bacteriophages (phages), that could be harnessed to combat multi-drug resistant enterococcal infections. Bacterial phage resistance represents a potential barrier to the implementation of phage therapy, emphasizing the importance of investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying the emergence of phage resistance. Using a cohort of 19 environmental lytic phages with tropism against E. faecalis, we found that these phages require the enterococcal polysaccharide antigen (Epa) for productive infection. Epa is a surface-exposed heteroglycan synthesized by enzymes encoded by both conserved and strain specific genes. We discovered that exposure to phage selective pressure favors mutation in non-conserved epa genes both in culture and in a mouse model of intestinal colonization. Despite gaining phage resistance, epa mutant strains exhibited a loss of resistance to the cell wall targeting antibiotics, vancomycin and daptomycin. Finally, we show that an E. faecalis epa mutant strain is deficient in intestinal colonization, cannot expand its population upon antibiotic-driven intestinal dysbiosis and fails to be efficiently transmitted to juvenile mice following birth. This study demonstrates that phage therapy could be used in combination with antibiotics to target enterococci within a dysbiotic microbiota. Enterococci that evade phage therapy by developing resistance may be less fit at colonizing the intestine and sensitized to vancomycin preventing their overgrowth during antibiotic treatment.",
