    "abstract": "The present study introduces a virtual life-sized perceptual-cognitive paradigm combining three dimensional multiple object tracking (3D-MOT) with motor (Experiment 1) or perceptual (Experiment 2) decision-making tasks. The objectives were to assess the impact of training on task performance and to determine the best training conditions for improvement and learning.\\n\\nSeventy-one participants were randomly trained under one of four training conditions (isolated 3D-MOT task, 3D-MOT simultaneously combined with a decision-making task, consolidated 3D-MOT and decision-making task, isolated decision-making task). Task performance was evaluated using speed thresholds, decision accuracy (%) and reaction time (s).\\n\\nFindings showed that the dual-task paradigm allowed satisfactory degrees of performance on both tasks despite an important dual-task cost. Interestingly, the results seemed to favor consolidated over simultaneous training for dual-task performance when 3D-MOT was combined with a motor task. The amount of attentional shared resources in regards to the nature of the additional task was discussed.",

    "abstract": "Real-world evidence derived from electronic health records (EHRs) is increasingly recognized as a supplement to evidence generated from traditional clinical trials. In oncology, tumor-based Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) endpoints are collected in clinical trials. The best approach for collecting similar endpoints from EHRs remains unknown. We evaluated the feasibility of a traditional RECIST-based methodology to assess EHR-derived real-world progression (rwP) and explored non-RECIST-based approaches. In this retrospective study, cohorts were randomly selected from Flatiron Healths database of patient-level EHR data in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. A RECIST-based approach was tested for feasibility (N=26). Three non-RECIST abstraction approaches were tested for feasibility, reliability, and validity (N=200): (1) radiology-anchored, (2) clinician-anchored, and (3) combined. RECIST-based cancer progression could be ascertained from the EHRs of 23% of patients (6/26). In 87% of patients (173/200), at least one rwP event was identified using both the radiology- and clinician-anchored approaches. rwP dates matched 90% of the time. In 72% of patients (124/173), the first clinician-anchored rwP event was accompanied by a downstream event (e.g., treatment change); the association was slightly lower for the radiology-anchored approach (67%; 121/180). Median overall survival (OS) was 17 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 14, 19). Median real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS) was 5.5 (95% CI: 4.6, 6.3) and 4.9 months (95% CI: 4.2, 5.6) for clinician-anchored and radiology-anchored approaches, respectively. Correlations between rwPFS and OS were similar across approaches (Spearmans rho: 0.65-0.66). Abstractors preferred the clinician-anchored approach as it provided more comprehensive context. RECIST cannot adequately assess cancer progression in EHR-derived data due to missing data and lack of clarity in radiology reports. We found a clinician-anchored approach supported by radiology report data to be the optimal, and most practical, method for characterizing tumor-based endpoints from EHR-sourced data.",

    "abstract": "Axons are thin tubular extensions generated by neuronal cells to transmit signals across long distances. In the peripheral and the central nervous systems, axons experience large deformations during normal activity or as a result of injury. Yet, axon biomechanics, and its relation to the internal structure that allows axons to withstand such deformations, is poorly understood. Up to now, it has been generally assumed that microtubules and their associated proteins are the major load-bearing elements in axons. We revise this view point by combining mechanical measurements using a custom developed force apparatus with biochemical or genetic modifications to the axonal cytoskeleton, revealing an unexpected role played by the actin-spectrin skeleton. For this, we first demonstrate that axons exhibit a reversible strain-softening response, where its steady state elastic modulus decreases with increasing strain. We then explore the contributions from the various cytoskeletal components of the axon, and show that the recently discovered membrane-associated skeleton consisting of periodically spaced actin filaments interconnected by spectrin tetramers play a prominent mechanical role. Finally, using a theoretical model we argue that the actin-spectrin skeleton act as an axonal tension buffer by reversibly unfolding repeat domains of the spectrin tetramers to buffer excess mechanical stress.",

    "abstract": "Efficient protocols for the production of recombinant proteins are indispensable for the development of the biopharmaceutical sector. Approximately 400 recombinant protein-based biopharmaceuticals have been approved in recent decades, with steady growth projected in the coming years. During the expression of a heterologous gene, the protein quality control network is overcome by the disruption in protein homeostasis, leading to protein aggregation. This phenomenon has been described in all expression systems analyzed to date, including prokaryotic and eukaryotic host cells. These protein aggregates have long been considered inert protein clumps devoid of biological activity and their study has largely been neglected. However, in recent years, the classic view of protein aggregates has completely changed with the recognition that these aggregates are a valuable source of functional recombinant proteins. In this study, bovine interferon-gamma (rBoIFN-{gamma}) was engineered to enhance the formation of protein aggregates by the addition of aggregation-prone peptides (APPs) in the generally recognized as safe (GRAS) bacterial Lactococcus lactis expression system. The L6K2, HALRU and CYOB peptides were selected to assess their intrinsic aggregation capability to nucleate protein aggregation. These APPs enhanced the tendency of the resulting protein to aggregate at the expense of the total protein yield. However, fine physicochemical characterization of the resulting intracellular protein nanoparticles (NPs), the protein released from these protein NPs, and the protein purified from the soluble cell fraction indicated that the compactability of protein conformations is directly related to the biological activity of variants of IFN-{gamma}, which is used here as a model protein with therapeutic potential.\\n\\nImportanceThe demand for recombinant proteins in the pharmaceutical industry is steadily increasing. Emerging novel protein formulations, including naturally occurring protein NPs, might be an alternative to soluble variants for fine analysis at the biophysical level. Such analyses are important to address safety about biological molecules.\\n\\nThis study analyzes the effect of aggregation-prone peptides (APPs) on the improvement of the production of naturally occurring protein nanoparticles (NPs) of interferon gamma (IFN-{gamma}) in the generally recognized as safe (GRAS) Lactococcus lactis expression system. In addition, the fine physico-chemical characterization of the resulting proteins, either obtained from the soluble or insoluble cell fractions, indicates that the selected engineered proteins embedded in the protein NPs show higher compactability than their soluble protein counterparts. Conformational compactability is directly related to the biological performance of the recombinant IFN-{gamma}.",

    "abstract": "NOD2 mutations are key risk factors for Crohns disease (CD). NOD2 contributes to intestinal homeostasis by regulating innate and adaptive immunity together with intestinal epithelial function. However, the roles of NOD2 during gut inflammation is not known. We initially observed that NOD2 expression was increased in epithelial cells remote from inflamed areas in CD patients. To explore this finding, Nod2 mRNA expression, inflammation and gut permeability were examined in the small bowel of wild-type (WT), Nod2 knockout and Nod2 mutant mice after rectal instillation of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). In WT mice, Nod2 upregulation remote to rectal injury was associated with pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, recirculating CD4+ T-cells, increased paracellular permeability and myosin like chain kinase activity. Nod2 knockout or mutation led to duodenitis and ileitis demonstrating the remote protective role of Nod2. Bone morrow stem cell (BMSC) transplantations indicated that the small intestinal inflammation was due to NOD2 loss in both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic compartments. As a whole, WT but not mutant NOD2 prevents disease extension at sites remote from the initial intestinal injury.",
