    "abstract": "The identification of de novo created genes is important as it provides a glimpse on the evolutionary processes of gene creation. Potential de novo created genes are identified by selecting genes that have no homologs outside a particular species, but for an accurate detection this identification needs to be correct.\\n\\nGenes without any homologs are often referred to as orphans; in addition to de novo created ones, fast evolving genes or genes lost in all related genomes might also be classified as orphans. The identification of orphans is dependent on: (i) a method to detect homologs and (ii) a database including genes from related genomes.\\n\\nHere, we set out to investigate how the detection of orphans is influenced by these two factors. Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae we identify that best strategy is to use a combination of searching annotated proteins and a six-frame translation of all ORFs from closely related genomes. Using this strategy we obtain a set of 54 orphans in Drosophila melanogaster and 38 in Drosophila pseudoobscura, significantly less than what is reported in some earlier studies.",

    "abstract": "A mismatch between top-down expectations and incoming sensory information is thought to be associated with hallucinations across a range of neuropsychiatric disorders. In Parkinsons disease with visual hallucinations, abnormal activity within the default network, and its pattern of connectivity with early visual regions, has been identified as a potential pathological source of the internally generated expectations that override incoming sensory input. In the context of attention deficits and visual dysfunction, mental imagery and perceptual expectancies generated across the default network are suggested to exert excessive influence over earlier visual regions, leading to aberrant perceptual experiences. Whilst converging neuroimaging evidence has identified unconstrained default network activity in Parkinsons disease with hallucinations, to date there has been a lack of behavioural evidence to confirm the consequences of an over-engaged default mode network - therefore the contributions it might make to hallucination phenomenology remain speculative. To address this, we administered a validated thought-sampling task to 38 Parkinsons disease patients (18 with hallucinations; 20 without) and 40 controls, to test the hypothesis that individuals with hallucinations experience an increased frequency of mind-wandering - a form of spontaneous cognition strongly associated with mental imagery and default network activity. The neural correlates of mind-wandering frequency were examined in relation to resting-state functional connectivity. Our results showed that patients with hallucinations exhibited significantly higher mind-wandering frequencies compared to non-hallucinators, who in turn had reduced levels of mind-wandering relative to controls. Inter-network connectivity and seed-to-voxel analyses confirmed that increased mind-wandering in the hallucinating vs. non-hallucinating group was associated with greater coupling between the primary visual cortex and dorsal default network. Taken together, both elevated mind-wandering and increased default-visual network coupling emerged as a distinguishing feature of the hallucinatory phenotype. We propose that the finding of increased mind-wandering reflects unconstrained spontaneous thought and mental imagery, which in turn furnish the content of visual hallucinations. Our findings suggest that primary visual cortex to dorsal default network coupling may provide a neural substrate by which regions of the default network exert disproportionate influence over ongoing visual perception. These findings refine current models of visual hallucinations by identifying a specific cognitive phenomenon and neural substrate consistent with the top-down influences over perception that have been implicated in visual hallucinations.",

    "abstract": "There is a critical unmet need for new tools to analyze and understand \\\"big data\\\" in the biological sciences where breakthroughs come from connecting massive genomics data with complex phenomics data. By integrating instant data visualization and statistical hypothesis testing, we have developed a new tool called OLIVER for phenomics visual data analysis with a unique function that any user adjustment will trigger real-time display updates for any affected elements in the workspace. By visualizing and analyzing omics data with OLIVER, biomedical researchers can quickly generate hypotheses and then test their thoughts within the same tool, leading to efficient knowledge discovery from complex, multi-dimensional biological data. The practice of OLIVER on multiple plant phenotyping experiments has shown that OLIVER can facilitate scientific discoveries. In the use case of OLIVER for large-scale plant phenotyping, a quick visualization identified emergent phenotypes that are highly transient and heterogeneous. The unique circular heat map with false-color plant images also indicates that such emergent phenotypes appear in different leaves under different conditions, suggesting that such previously unseen processes are critical for plant responses to dynamic environments.",

We investigated the impact of metronidazole (MET) and metronidazole plus azithromycin (MET+AZ) on the microbiota in pediatric CD, and the use of microbiota features as classifiers or predictors of disease remission.\\n\\nMethods16S rRNA-based microbiota profiling was performed on stool samples from 67 patients in a multinational, randomized, controlled, longitudinal, 12-week trial of MET vs. MET+AZ in children with mild to moderate CD. Profiles were analyzed together with disease activity, and then used to construct Random Forest models to classify remission or predict treatment response.\\n\\nResultsBoth MET and MET+AZ significantly decreased diversity of the microbiota and caused large treatment-specific shifts in microbiota structure at week 4. Disease remission was associated with a treatment-specific microbiota configuration. Random Forest models constructed from microbiota profiles pre- and during antibiotic treatment with metronidazole accurately classified disease remission in this treatment group (AUC of 0.879, 95% CI 0.683, 0.9877; sensitivity 0.7778; specificity 1.000, P < 0.001).

In these systems, an important quantity that controls spatial coordination and emergent collective behavior is the length scale over which elastic strains persist. We estimate this quantity in the context of ordered composites comprised of cross-linked elastic filaments sheared by active motors. Combining a mean-field theory valid for negligibly noisy systems with discrete simulations for noisy systems, we show that the effect of localized strains - be they steady or oscillatory - persist over distances determined by motor kinetics, motor elasticity and filament extensibility. The cut-off length that emerges from these effects controls the transmission of mechanical information and determines the criterion for spatially separated motor groups to stay synchronized. Our results generalize the notion of persistence in passive, Brownian filaments to active, cross-linked filaments.",

    "abstract": "Hyperthermia (HT) has shown feasibility and potency as an anticancer therapy. Administration of HT in the chemotherapy has previously enhanced the cytotoxicity of drugs against pancreatic cancer. However, the drugs used when conducting these studies are substantially conventional chemotherapeutic agents that may cause unwanted side effects. Additionally, the thermal dosage in the treatment of cancer cells could also probably harm the healthy cells. The purpose of this work was to investigate the potential of the two natural polyphenolic compounds, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and chlorogenic acid (CGA), as heat synergizers in the thermal treatment of the PANC-1 cells. Furthermore, we have introduced a novel strategy entitled the thermal cycling-hyperthermia (TC-HT) that is capable of providing a maximum synergy and minimal side effect with the anticancer compounds. Our results demonstrate that the combination of the TC-HT and the CGA or EGCG markedly exerts the anticancer effect against the PANC-1 cells, while none of the single treatment induced such changes. The synergistic activity was attributed to the cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and the induction of the ROS-dependent mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. These findings not only represent the first thermal synergistic study of natural compounds in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, but also highlight the potential application of the TC-HT as an alternative strategy in anticancer treatment.",

This is especially relevant to the ancient human DNA field where it is difficult to distinguish endogenous molecules from human contaminants due to their genetic similarity. Recently, with the advent of high-throughput sequencing and new aDNA protocols, hundreds of ancient human genomes have become available. Contamination in those genomes has been measured with computational methods often developed specifically for these empirical studies. Consequently, some of these methods have not been implemented and tested while few are aimed at low-depth data, a common feature in aDNA datasets.\\n\\nResultsWe develop a new X-chromosome-based maximum likelihood method for estimating present-day human contamination in low-depth sequencing data. We implement our method for general use, assess its performance under conditions typical of ancient human DNA research, and compare it to previous nuclear data-based methods through extensive simulations. For low-depth data, we show that existing methods can produce unusable estimates or substantially underestimate contamination. In contrast, our method provides accurate estimates for a depth of coverage as low as 0.5x on the X-chromosome when contamination is below 25%. Moreover, our method still yields meaningful estimates in very challenging situations, i.e., when the contaminant and the target come from closely related populations or with increased error rates. With a running time below five minutes, our method is applicable to large scale aDNA genomic studies.\\n\\nAvailability and implementationThe method is implemented in C++ and R and is freely available in https://github.com/sapfo/contaminationX.\\n\\nContactmorenomayar@gmail.com, annasapfo.malaspinas@unil.ch.",

High variability of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) making them particularly dangerous by allowing them to evade the hosts immune system. HIV and HCV outbreaks pose a significant problem for public health for solving which it is critical to infer transmission clusters, i.e., to decide whether two viral samples belong to the same outbreak. Initial approach [10] was based on estimating relatedness between two samples as the distance between consensuses of the corresponding viral populations. The distance between closest pair of representatives from two populations, MinDist, has been shown to be significantly more accurate [2]. Unfortunately, MinDist computation requires a cumbersome RNA-seq data assembly and identification of all viral sequences from a given project. We present a novel approach that allows to bypass read assembly and estimate the distance between viral samples based on k-mer (i.e. a substring of length k) distribution in RNA-seq reads. The experimental validation using sequencing data from HCV outbreaks shows that the proposed algorithms can successfully identify genetic relatedness between viral populations, infer transmission clusters and outbreak sources, as well decide whether the primary spreader is present in the sequenced outbreak sample.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic combinations are increasingly used to combat bacterial infections. Multidrug therapies are a particularly important treatment option for E. faecalis, an opportunistic pathogen that contributes to high-inoculum infections such as infective endocarditis. While numerous synergistic drug combinations for E. faecalis have been identified, much less is known about how different combinations impact the rate of resistance evolution. In this work, we use high-throughput laboratory evolution experiments to quantify adaptation in growth rate and drug resistance of E. faecalis exposed to drug combinations exhibiting different classes of interactions, ranging from synergistic to suppressive. We identify a wide range of evolutionary behavior, including both increased and decreased rates of growth adaptation, depending on the specific interplay between drug interaction and cross resistance. For example, selection in a dual-lactam combination leads to accelerated growth adaptation compared to selection with the individual drugs, even though the resulting resistance profiles are nearly identical. On the other hand, populations evolved in an aminoglycoside and -lactam combination exhibit decreased growth adaptation and resistant profiles that depend on the specific drug concentrations. We show that the main qualitative features of these evolutionary trajectories can be explained by simple rescaling arguments that correspond to geometric transformations of the two-drug growth response surfaces measured in ancestral cells. The analysis also reveals multiple examples where resistance profiles selected by drug combinations correspond to (nearly) optimized linear combinations of those selected by the component drugs. Our results highlight trade-offs between drug interactions and collateral effects during the evolution of multi-drug resistance and emphasize evolutionary benefits and disadvantages of particular drug pairs targeting enterococci.",

Here we investigated the functional role of Golgi {beta}ARs in cardiac myocytes and found they activate Golgi localized, prohypertrophic, phosphoinositide hydrolysis, that is not accessed by cell surface {beta}AR stimulation. This pathway is accessed by the physiological neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) via an Oct3 organic cation transporter. Blockade of Oct3 or specific blockade of Golgi resident {beta}1ARs prevents NE dependent cardiac myocyte hypertrophy. This clearly defines a physiological pathway activated by internal GPCRs in a biologically relevant cell type and has implications for development of more efficacious {beta}-blocker therapies.",

    "abstract": "During energy demanding conditions, white adipocytes store triglycerides and release fatty acids through lipolysis. In contrast, bone marrow adipocytes (BM-Ad) increase in size during caloric restriction, suggesting this fat depot exhibits precise metabolic specificity. We found subcutaneous adipocytes (SC-Ad) and BM-Ad share morphological features, but possess distinct lipid metabolism. BM-Ad show enrichment in cholesterol-oriented metabolism that correlates with increased free cholesterol content, while proteins involved in lipolysis were downregulated. A strong down-regulation in expression of monoacylglycerol (MG) lipase was observed leading to an accumulation of major MG species and accordingly the basal and induced lipolytic responses were absent in BM-Ad. These features are not recapitulated in vitro using differentiated bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. Since our data demonstrate that BM-Ad comprise a distinct class of adipocytes, we propose renaming them yellow adipocytes.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular electron transfer is the key process underpinning the development of bioelectrochemical systems for the production of energy or added-value compounds. Thermincola potens JR is a promising Gram-positive bacterium to be used in these systems because it is thermophilic. In this paper we describe the structural and functional properties of the nonaheme cytochrome OcwA, which is the terminal reductase of this organism. The structure of OcwA, determined at 2.2[A] resolution shows that the overall-fold and organization of the hemes are not related to other metal reductases and instead are similar to that of multiheme cytochromes involved in the biogeochemical cycles of nitrogen and sulfur. We show that, in addition to solid electron acceptors, OcwA can also reduce soluble electron shuttles and oxyanions. These data reveal that OcwA can take the role of a respiratory  swiss-army knife allowing this organism to grow in environments with rapidly changing availability of terminal electron acceptors without the need for transcriptional regulation and protein synthesis.\\n\\nImportanceThermophilic Gram-positive organisms were recently shown to be a promising class of organisms to be used in bioelectrochemical systems for the production of electrical energy. These organisms present a thick peptidoglycan layer that was thought to preclude them to perform extracellular electron transfer (i.e. exchange catabolic electrons with solid electron acceptors outside of the cell). In this manuscript we describe the structure and functional mechanisms of the multiheme cytochrome OcwA, the terminal reductase of the Gram-positive bacterium Thermincola potens JR found at the cell surface of this organism. The results presented here show that this protein is unrelated with terminal reductases found at the cell surface of other electroactive organisms. Instead, OcwA is similar to terminal reductases of soluble electron acceptors. Our data reveals that terminal oxidoreductases of soluble and insoluble substrates are evolutionarily related, providing novel insights into the evolutionary pathway of multiheme cytochromes.",

    "abstract": "Every cell is protected by a semipermeable membrane. Peptides with the right properties, e.g. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), can disrupt this protective barrier by formation of leaky pores. Unfortunately, matching peptide properties with their ability to selectively form pores in bacterial membranes remains elusive. In particular, the proline/glycine kink in helical peptides was reported to both increase and decrease antimicrobial activity. We used computer simulations and fluorescence experiments to show that a kink in helices affects the formation of membrane pores by stabilizing toroidal pores but disrupting barrel-stave pores. The position of the proline/glycine kink in the sequence further controls the specific structure of toroidal pore. Moreover, we demonstrate that two helical peptides can form a kink-like connection with similar behavior as one long helical peptide with a kink. The provided molecular-level insight can be utilized for design and modification of pore forming antibacterial peptides or toxins.",

    "abstract": "The TRPV1 cation non-selective ion channel plays an essential role in thermosensation and perception of other noxious stimuli. TRPV1 can be activated by low pH, high temperature or naturally occurring pungent molecules such as allicin, capsaicin or resiniferatoxin. Its noxious thermal sensitivity makes it an important participant as a thermal sensor in mammals. However, details of the mechanism of channel activation by increases in temperature remain unclear. Here we used a combination of approaches to try to understand the role of the ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) in channel behavior. First, a computational modeling approach by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation of the whole TRPV1 embedded in a phosphatidylcholine (POPC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE) membrane provides insight into the dynamics of this channel domain. Global analysis of the structural ensemble shows that the ankyrin repeat domain is a region that sustains high fluctuations during dynamics at different temperatures. We then performed biochemical and thermal stability studies of the purified ARD by means of circular dichroism and tryptophan fluorescence and demonstrate that this region undergoes structural changes at similar temperatures that lead to TRPV1 activation. Our data suggest that the ARD is a dynamic module and that it may participate in controlling the temperature sensitivity of TRPV1.\\n\\nStatement of SignificanceThis work demonstrates that the temperature-dependent dynamics of the ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) of TRPV1 channels, as probed by coarse-grained molecular dynamics, corresponds to the experimentally determined dynamics of an isolated ARD domain. These results show that this region of TRPV1 channels undergoes significant conformational change as a function of increased temperature and suggest that it participates in the temperature-dependent structural changes that lead to channel opening.",

Besides validating the fact that the imputation accuracy could always benefit from the increased panel size when the reference panel was population-specific, the results brought two new thoughts as follows. First, when the haplotype size of reference panel was fixed, the imputation accuracy of common and low-frequency variants (MAF>0.5%) decreased while the population-diversity of reference panel increased, but for rare variants (MAF<0.5%), a fraction of diversity (<20%) of panel could improve the imputation accuracy. Second, when the haplotype size of reference panel was increased with extra population-diverse samples, the imputation accuracy of common variants (MAF>5%) for European population could always benefit from the expanding sample size. But for Han Chinese population, the accuracy of all imputed variants reached the highest when reference panel contained a fraction of extra diverse sample (15%[~]21%). In addition, we evaluated the existing reference panels such as the HRC and 1000G Phase3 and CONVERGE. For European population, HRC was the best reference panel. For Han Chinese population, we proposed an optimum constituent ratio for the Han Chinese imputation if researchers would like to customize their own sequenced reference panel, but a high quality and large-scale Chinese reference panel was still needed.

    "abstract": "Self-incompatibility systems in angiosperms are exemplars of extreme allelic polymorphism maintained by long-term balancing selection. Pollen that shares an allele with the pollen recipient at the self-incompatibility locus is rejected, and this rejection favors rare alleles as well as preventing self-fertilization. Advances in molecular genetics reveal that an ancient, deeply conserved, and well-studied incompatibility system functions through multiple tightly linked genes encoding separate pollen-expressed F-box proteins and pistil-expressed ribonucleases. We show that certain recombinant haplotypes at the incompatibility locus can drive collapse in the number of incompatibility types. We use a modified evolutionary rescue model to calculate the relative probabilities of increase and collapse in number of incompatibility types given the initial collection of incompatibility haplotypes and the population rate of gene conversion. We find that expansion in haplotype number is possible when population size or the rate of gene conversion is large, but large contractions are likely otherwise. By iterating a Markov chain model derived from these expansion and collapse probabilities, we find that a stable haplotype number distribution in the realistic range of 10-40 is possible under plausible parameters. However, small or moderate-sized populations should be susceptible to substantial additional loss of haplotypes beyond those lost by chance during bottlenecks. The same processes that can generate many incompatibility haplotypes in large populations may therefore be crushing haplotype diversity in smaller populations.",

    "abstract": "AimMuch debate exists about how the brain transitions into an epileptic seizure. One source of confusion is that there are likely to be critical differences between experimental seizure models. To address this, we compared the evolving activity patterns in two, widely used, in vitro models of epileptic discharges.\\n\\nMethodsWe compared brain slices, prepared in the same way from young adult mice, that were bathed either in 0 Mg2+, or 100{micro}M 4AP, artificial cerebrospinal fluid.\\n\\nResultsWe find that while local field potential recordings of epileptiform discharges in the two models appear broadly similar, patch-clamp analysis reveals an important difference in the relative degree of glutamatergic involvement. 4AP affects parvalbumin-expressing interneurons more than other cortical populations, destabilizing their resting state and inducing spontaneous bursting behavior. Consequently, the most prominent pattern of transient discharge (\\\"interictal event\\\") in this model is almost purely GABAergic, although the transition to seizure-like events (SLEs) involves pyramidal recruitment. In contrast, interictal discharges in 0 Mg2+ are only maintained by a very large glutamatergic component that also involves transient discharges of the interneurons. Seizure-like events in 0 Mg2+ have significantly higher power in the high gamma frequency band (60-120Hz) than these events do in 4AP, and are greatly delayed in onset by diazepam, unlike 4AP events.\\n\\nConclusionsThe 0 Mg2+ and 4AP models display fundamentally different levels of glutamatergic drive, demonstrating how ostensibly similar pathological discharges can arise from different sources. We contend that similar interpretative issues will also be relevant to clinical practice.",

However, the physiological determinants of the increase in [V]O2 during exercise have not been examined using multivariate analysis in individuals with stroke. This study aimed to identify the physiological determinants of the increase in [V]O2 during a graded exercise in terms of the respiratory function, cardiac function, and ability of skeletal muscles to extract oxygen.\\n\\nMethodsEighteen individuals with stroke (60.1 {+/-} 9.4 years of age, 67.1 {+/-} 30.8 days poststroke) underwent a graded exercise test for the assessment of cardiorespiratory response to exercise. The increase in [V]O2 from rest to ventilatory threshold and that from rest to peak exercise were measured as a dependent variable. The increases in respiratory rate, tidal volume, heart rate, stroke volume, and arterial-venous oxygen difference from rest to ventilatory threshold and those from rest to peak exercise were measured as independent variables.\\n\\nResultsFrom rest to ventilatory threshold, the increases in heart rate ({beta} = 0.546) and arterial-venous oxygen difference ({beta} = 0.398) were significant determinants of the increase in [V]O2 (adjusted R2 = 0.703, p < 0.001).

    "abstract": "Extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors are a major class of environmentally-responsive transcriptional regulators. In Alphaproteobacteria the ECF sigma factor, {sigma}EcfG, activates general stress response (GSR) transcription and protects cells from multiple stressors. A phosphorylation-dependent protein partner switching mechanism, involving HWE/HisKA_2-family histidine kinases, underlies {sigma}EcfG activation. The identity of these sensor kinases and the signals that regulate them remain largely uncharacterized. We have developed the aerobic anoxygenic photoheterotrophic (AAP) bacterium, Erythrobacter litoralis DSM 8509, as a comparative genetic model to investigate GSR regulation. Using this system, we sought to define the contribution of visible light and a photosensory HWE kinase, LovK, to GSR transcription. We identified three HWE kinases that collectively regulate GSR: gsrK and lovK are activators, while gsrP is a repressor. GSR transcription is higher in the dark than light, and the opposing activities of gsrK and gsrP are sufficient to achieve light-dependent differential transcription. In the absence of gsrK and gsrP, lovK alone is sufficient to regulate GSR transcription in response to light. This regulation requires a photochemically active LOV domain in LovK. Our studies establish a role for visible light and HWE kinases in light-dependent regulation of GSR transcription in E. litoralis, an AAP species.\\n\\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=174 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/641647v1_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (19K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@65ed9borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d25e65org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@333ff9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ad2cf4_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG ABBREVIATED SUMMARYGeneral stress response (GSR) systems protect bacteria from a diverse range of physical and chemical stressors.

    "abstract": "To enhance wakefulness, daily consumption of caffeine in the morning and afternoon is highly common. However, it is unknown whether such a regular intake pattern affects timing and quality of wakefulness, as regulated by an interplay of circadian and sleep-homeostatic mechanisms. Thus, we investigated the effects of daily caffeine intake and its withdrawal on circadian rhythms and wake-promotion in 20 male young habitual caffeine consumers. We applied a double-blind, within-subject design with a caffeine (150 mg, 3 x daily), a placebo, and a withdrawal condition each lasting ten days. Starting on day nine of treatment, salivary melatonin and cortisol, evening nap sleep, as well as sleepiness and vigilance performance throughout day and night were quantified during 43 h under controlled laboratory conditions. Neither the time course of melatonin (i.e., onset, amplitude, or area under the curve) nor the time course of cortisol were significantly affected by caffeine intake or its withdrawal. During withdrawal, however, volunteers reported increased sleepiness, showed more attentional lapses, as well as polysomnography-derived markers of elevated sleep propensity in the late evening compared to both, placebo and caffeine conditions. Thus, the typical timing of habitual caffeine intake in humans may not necessarily shift circadian phase nor lead to clear-cut benefits in alertness. The time-of-day independent effects of caffeine withdrawal suggest an adaptation to the substance, presumably in the homeostatic aspect of sleep-wake regulation.",

    "abstract": "Prenatal infections are environmental risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders. In addition, traumatic experiences during adolescence in individuals exposed to infections during gestation could increase the risk of schizophrenia. Given the tremendous burden that these diseases pose on societies when they fully manifest, it is of the most crucial importance to discover potential markers of the disease in its early stages or even before its onset, so that therapeutic strategies may be implemented. In the present study, we combined a well-characterized two-hit model of schizophrenia-related symptoms with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy to discover potential biomarkers. To this end, we i.p. injected 100 g/kg/ml of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or saline on gestational days 15 and 16 to pregnant rats. Their male offspring were then subjected to five episodes of stress or handling on alternate days during postnatal days (PND) 28 to 38. Once the animals reached adulthood (PND70), we evaluated prepulse inhibition (PPI). At PND90, we performed an ex vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy study in the cortex and striatum. While we did not detect alterations in PPI at the age tested, we found neurochemical disturbances induced by LPS, stress or (more interestingly) their interaction. LPS decreased glucose levels in the cortex and striatum and altered glutamate, glutamine and N-acetylaspartate levels. Glutamate and glutamine levels in the left (but not right) striatum were differentially affected by prenatal LPS exposure in a manner that depended on stress experiences. These results suggest that alterations in the glutamate cycle in the striatum may predate the full emergence of disorders of the schizophrenic spectrum and could be used as early markers of the disease.",

In this study, we collected gut microbiome activity (i.e., metatranscriptomic) data and measured the glycemic responses of 550 adults who consumed more than 30,000 meals from omnivore or vegetarian/gluten-free diets. We demonstrate that gut microbiome activity makes a statistically significant contribution to individual variation in glycemic response, in addition to anthropometric factors and the nutritional composition of foods. We describe predictive models (multilevel mixed-effects regression and gradient boosting machine) of variation in glycemic response among individuals ingesting the same foods. We introduce functional features aggregated from microbial activity data as candidates for association with mechanisms of glycemic control. In summary, we demonstrate for the first time that metatranscriptomic activity of the gut microbiome is correlated with glycemic response among adults.",

    "abstract": "In metal-scarce environments, some pathogenic bacteria produce opine-type metallophores mainly to face the hosts nutritional immunity. This is the case of staphylopine, pseudopaline and yersinopine, identified in Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Yersinia pestis respectively. These metallophores are synthesized by two (CntLM) or three enzymes (CntKLM), CntM catalyzing the last step of biosynthesis using diverse substrates (pyruvate or -ketoglutarate), pathway intermediates (xNA or yNA) and cofactors (NADH or NADPH), depending on the species. Here, we explored substrate specificity of CntM by combining bioinformatics and structural analysis with chemical synthesis and enzymatic studies. We found that NAD(P)H selectivity was mainly due to the amino acid at position 33 (S. aureus numbering) which ensures a preferential binding to NADPH when it is an arginine. Moreover, whereas CntM from P. aeruginosa preferentially uses yNA over xNA, the staphylococcal enzyme is not stereospecific. Most importantly, selectivity towards -ketoacids is largely governed by a single residue at position 150 of CntM (S. aureus numbering): an aspartate at this position ensures selectivity towards pyruvate whereas an alanine leads to the consumption of both pyruvate and -ketoglutarate. Modifying this residue in P. aeruginosa led to a complete reversal of selectivity. Thus, opine-type metallophore diversity is mainly mediated by the absence/presence of a cntK gene encoding a histidine racemase, and the presence of an aspartate/alanine at position 150 of CntM. These two simple rules predict the production of a fourth metallophore by Paenibacillus mucilaginosus, which was confirmed in vitro and called bacillopaline.",

As Earths climate changes, the response of microbes and microbial enzymes to rising temperatures will largely determine the soil carbon feedback to atmospheric CO2. However, while increasing attention focuses on physiological and ecological mechanisms of microbial responses, the role of evolutionary adaptation has been little studied. To address this gap, we developed an ecosystem-evolutionary model of a soil microbe-enzyme system under warming. Constraining the model with observations from five contrasting sites reveals evolutionary aggravation of soil carbon loss to be the most likely outcome; however, temperature-dependent increases in mortality could cause an evolutionary buffering effect instead. We generally predict a strong latitudinal pattern, from small evolutionary effects at low latitude to large evolutionary effects at high latitudes. Accounting for evolutionary mechanisms will likely be critical for improving projections of Earth system responses to climate change.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 20% of adults in the U.S. will experience an affective disorder during their life. While it is well established that serotonin (5-HT) is a crucial factor in mood, impaired cellular bioenergetics are also implicated. Creatine (Cr), through the Cr/Phospho-Cr (PCr) shuttle, maintains high ATP concentrations in the neuron. This system may be implicated in the etiology of affective disorders, as reduced Cr, PCr, and ATP are often seen in the brains of affected patients. To address this issue, Cr transporter (Crt) deficient male mice (Slc6a8-/y) and female mice heterozygous for Crt expression (Slc6a8+/-) were used to evaluate how a Cr deficient system would alter affective-like behaviors. Slc6a8-/y and Slc6a8+/- mice had more escapes and faster escape latencies in learned helplessness, indicating a potential resilience to behavioral despair. Elevated zero maze and tail-suspension test performance matched that of wildtype mice, however. Slc6a8-/y mice have increased 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid content in the hippocampus and striatum and increased monoamine oxidase protein and tryptophan hydroxylase-2 protein content in the hippocampus, while serotonin levels are unchanged. This indicates an increase in 5-HT turnover. Our results indicate that Cr plays a complex role in affective disorders and 5-HT neurotransmission, warranting further investigation.",

We have screened over 2,600 publicly available M. bovis genomes and newly sequenced two wildlife M. bovis strains, gathering 823 genomes from 21 countries and 21 host-species, including humans, to complete a phylogenomic analyses.

Our data divergence analysis agreed with previous studies reporting independent archeological data of ancient M. bovis [(South Siberian infected skeletons at [~]2,000 years BP (before present)] and indicates that extant M. bovis originated during the Roman period, subsequently dispersing across the world with the discovery and settlement of the New World and Oceania, directly influenced by trades among countries.",

It has been suggested that JEV gets access to the central nervous system (CNS) as a consequence of a preceding inflammatory process which leads to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and viral neuroinvasion. However, what happens at early times of JEV contact with the BBB is poorly understood. In the present work, we evaluated the ability of both a virulent and a vaccine strain of JEV (JEV RP9 and SA14-14-2, respectively) to cross an in cellulo human BBB model consisting of hCMEC/D3 human endothelial cells cultivated on permeable inserts above SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cells. Using this system, we demonstrated that both JEV RP9 and SA14-14-2 are able to cross the BBB without disrupting it at early times post-addition. Furthermore, this BBB model was able to discriminate between the virulent RP9 and the vaccine SA14-14-2 strains, as demonstrated by the presence of almost 10 times more RP9 infectious particles that crossed the BBB than SA14-14 particles at a high MOI. Besides contributing to the understanding of early events in JEV neuroinvasion, this in cellulo BBB model represents a suitable and useful system to study the viral determinants of JEV neuroinvasiveness and the molecular mechanisms by which this flavivirus crosses the BBB at early times of neuroinvasion.",

    "abstract": "Biological switches are wide spread in many biological systems. Among them, the switch of the bacterial flagellar motor has generated much interest because it affects a mechanical process rather than a chemical reaction, it controls the direction of rotation of a rotary motor rather than being an on/off switch, and it is exceptionally ultrasensitive. Yet, the molecular mechanism underlying its function has remained unknown. Here we resolved unique features of this mechanism: On the one hand, it is tightly regulated by multiple means, involving three binding sites and two different covalent modifications, with the binding specificity being dictated by the type of covalent modification and by a strict binding sequence. On the other hand, it endows the motor with flexibility as it involves an intermediate stage of brief switches that provides a \"go/no go\" situation, in which the motor can either proceed to a stable rotation in the new direction or shift back to the original direction. This intermediate stage appears to be a means of the cell to produce angular deflection of swimming while maintaining directional persistence. Furthermore, we show by mathematical modeling that such a switching mechanism can provide ultrasensitivity. This unique combination of tight regulation, flexibility, and ultrasensitivity makes this switching mechanism of special interest.",

    "abstract": "We present KnowEnG, a free-to-use computational system for analysis of genomics data sets, designed to accelerate biomedical discovery. It includes tools for popular bioinformatics tasks such as gene prioritization, sample clustering, gene set analysis and expression signature analysis. The system offers  knowledge-guided data-mining and machine learning algorithms, where user-provided data are analyzed in light of prior information about genes, aggregated from numerous knowledge-bases and encoded in a massive  Knowledge Network. KnowEnG adheres to  FAIR principles: its tools are easily portable to diverse computing environments, run on the cloud for scalable and cost-effective execution of compute-intensive and data-intensive algorithms, and are interoperable with other computing platforms. They are made available through multiple access modes including a web-portal, and include specialized visualization modules. We present use cases and re-analysis of published cancer data sets using KnowEnG tools and demonstrate its potential value in democratization of advanced tools for the modern genomics era.",

    "abstract": "Historic yield advances in the major crops have to a large part been achieved by selection for improved productivity of groups of plant individuals such as high-density stands. Research suggests that such improved group productivity depends on \"cooperative\" traits (e.g. erect leaves, short stems) that - while beneficial to the group - decrease individual fitness under competition. This poses a problem for some traditional breeding approaches, especially when selection occurs at the level of individuals, because \"selfish\" traits will be selected for and reduce yields in high-density monocultures. One approach therefore has been to select individuals based on ideotypes with traits expected to promote group productivity. However, this approach is limited to architectural and physiological traits whose effects on growth and competition are relatively easy to anticipate.\n\nHere, we developed a general and simple method for the discovery of alleles promoting cooperation in plant stands. Our method is based on the game-theoretical premise that alleles increasing cooperation incur a cost to the individual but benefit the monoculture group. Testing the approach using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, we found a major effect locus where the rarer allele was associated with increased cooperation and productivity in high-density stands. The allele likely affects a pleiotropic gene, since we find that it is also associated with reduced root competition but higher resistance against disease. Thus, even though cooperation is considered evolutionarily unstable, conflicting selective forces acting on a pleiotropic gene might maintain latent genetic variation for it in nature. Such variation, once identified in a crop, could be rapidly leveraged in modern breeding programs and provide efficient routes to increase yields.",
