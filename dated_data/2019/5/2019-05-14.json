    "abstract": "The mitochondrial uniporter is calcium-activated calcium channel complex critical for cellular signaling and bioenergetics. MCU, the pore-forming subunit of the uniporter, contains two transmembrane domains and is found in all major eukaryotic taxa. In amoeba and fungi, MCU homologs are sufficient to form a functional calcium channel, whereas human MCU exhibits a strict requirement for the metazoan-specific, single-pass transmembrane protein EMRE for conductance. Here, we exploit this evolutionary divergence to decipher the molecular basis of the human MCUs dependence on EMRE. By systematically generating chimeric proteins that consist of EMRE-independent D. discoideum MCU (DdMCU) and H. sapiens MCU (HsMCU), we converged on a stretch of 10 amino acids in DdMCU that can be transplanted to HsMCU to render it EMRE-dependent. We call this region in human MCU the EMRE-dependence domain (EDD). Crosslinking experiments show that HsEMRE directly interacts with MCU at both of its transmembrane domains as well as the EDD. Based on previously published structures of fungal MCU homologs, the EDD segment is located distal to the calcium pores selectivity filter and appears flexible. We propose that EMRE stabilizes EDD of MCU, permitting both channel opening and calcium conductance",

    "abstract": "The CLIC family of proteins display the unique feature of altering their structure from a soluble form to a membrane-bound chloride channel. CLIC1, a member of this family, can be found in the cytoplasm or in nuclear, ER and plasma membranes, with membrane overexpression linked to tumour proliferation. The molecular switch promoting CLIC1 membrane insertion has been related to environmental factors, but still remains unclear. Here, we use solution NMR studies to confirm that both the soluble and membrane bound forms are in the same oxidation state. Our data from fluorescence assays and chloride efflux assays indicate that Ca2+ and Zn2+ trigger association to the membrane into active chloride channels. We use fluorescence microscopy to confirm that an increase of the intracellular Ca2+ leads to re-localisation of CLIC1 to both plasma and internal membranes. Finally, we show that soluble CLIC1 adopts an equilibrium of oligomeric species, and Ca2+/Zn2+ mediated membrane insertion promotes the formation of a tetrameric assembly. Thus, our results identify Ca2+ and Zn2+ binding as the molecular switch promoting CLIC1 membrane insertion.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTCLIC1, a member of the CLIC family of proteins, is expressed as a soluble protein in cells but can insert in the membrane forming a chloride channel. This chloride channel form is upregulated in different types of cancers including glioblastoma and promote tumour invasiveness and metastasis. The factors promoting CLIC1 membrane insertion nor the mechanism of this process are yet understood. Here, we use a combination of solution NMR, biophysics and fluorescence microscopy to identify Ca2+ and Zn2+ binding as the switch to promote CLIC1 insertion into the membrane to form active chloride channels. We also provide a simple mechanism how such transition to the membrane occurs. Such understanding will enable subsequent studies on the structure of the chloride channel form and its inhibition.",

    "abstract": "The elucidation of the how and when of a cell-fate change asks for a physically reasonable mechanism allowing to achieve a coordinated switching of thousands of genes within a small and highly packed cell nucleus. We previously demonstrated that whole genome expression is dynamically self-organized through the emergence of a critical point. Furthermore, it has been confirmed that this happens at both the cell-population and single-cell level through the physical principle of self-organized criticality.\n\nIn this paper, we further examine the genomic mechanism which determines cell-fate changes from embryo to cancer development. The state of the critical point, acting as the organizing center of cell-fate, determines whether the genome resides in a super- or sub-critical state. In the super-critical state, a specific stochastic perturbation can spread over the entire system through the  genome engine - an autonomous critical-control genomic system, whereas in the sub-critical state, the perturbation remains at a local level. We provide a consistent framework to develop a biological regulation transition theory demonstrating the cell-fate change.",

    "abstract": "Understanding past dispersal and breeding events can provide insight into ecology and evolution, and can help inform strategies for conservation and the control of pest species. However, parent-offspring dispersal can be difficult to investigate in rare species and in small pest species such as mosquitoes. Here we develop a methodology for estimating parent-offspring dispersal from the spatial distribution of close kin, using pairwise kinship estimates derived from genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). SNPs were scored in 162 Aedes aegypti (yellow fever mosquito) collected from eight close-set, high-rise apartment buildings in an area of Malaysia with high dengue incidence. We used the SNPs to reconstruct kinship groups across three orders of kinship. We transformed the geographical distances between all kin pairs within each kinship category into axial standard deviations of these distances, then decomposed these into components representing past dispersal events. From these components, we isolated the axial standard deviation of parent-offspring dispersal, and estimated neighbourhood area (129 m), median parent-offspring dispersal distance (75 m), and oviposition dispersal radius within a gonotrophic cycle (36 m). We also analysed genetic structure using distance-based redundancy analysis and linear regression, finding isolation by distance both within and between buildings and estimating neighbourhood size at 268 individuals. These findings indicate the scale required to suppress local outbreaks of arboviral disease and to target releases of modified mosquitoes for mosquito and disease control. Our methodology is readily implementable for studies of other species, including pests and species of conservation significance.",

Data from FreeHi-C exhibit higher fidelity to the biological Hi-C data compared with other tools in its class.

However, the precise sequences determining phase separation remain unclear. Furthermore, a large number of phase-separated proteins that exhibit relatively low IDR content remain uncharacterized. Phase-separated proteins appear as spherical droplet structures in immunofluorescence (IF) images, which renders them distinguishable from non-phase-separated proteins. Here, we transformed the problem of phase-separated protein recognition into a binary classification problem of image recognition. In addition, we established a method named IDeepPhase to identify IF images with spherical droplet structures based on convolutional neural networks. Using IDeepPhase on proteome-scale IF images from the Human Protein Atlas database, we generated a comprehensive list of phase-separated candidates which displayed spherical droplet structures in IF images, allowing nomination of proteins, antibodies and cell lines for subsequent phase separation study.",

    "abstract": "Gene silencing through RNA interference (RNAi) shapes many biological processes in filamentous fungi, including pathogenicity. In this study we explored the requirement of key components of fungal RNAi machinery, including DICER-like 1 and 2 (FgDCL1, FgDCL2), ARGONAUTE 1 and 2 (FgAGO1, FgAGO2), AGO-interacting protein FgQIP (QDE2-interacting protein), RecQ helicase (FgQDE3), and four RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (FgRdRP1, FgRdRP2, FgRdRP3, FgRdRP4), in the ascomycete mycotoxin-producing fungal pathogen Fusarium graminearum (Fg) for sexual and asexual multiplication, pathogenicity, and its sensitivity to double-stranded (ds)RNA. We corroborate and extend earlier findings that conidiation, ascosporogenesis and Fusarium Head Blight (FHB) symptom development require an operable RNAi machinery. The involvement of RNAi in conidiation is dependent on environmental conditions as it is detectable only under low light (< 2 {micro}mol m-2s-1). Although both DCLs and AGOs partially share their functions, the sexual ascosporogenesis is mediated primarily by FgDCL1 and FgAGO2, while FgDCL2 and FgAGO1 contribute to asexual conidia formation and germination. FgDCL1 and FgAGO2 also account for pathogenesis as their knock-out (KO) results in reduced FHB development. Apart from KO mutants{Delta} dcl2 and{Delta} ago1, mutants{Delta} rdrp2, {Delta}rdrp3, {Delta}rdrp4, {Delta}qde3 and{Delta} qip are strongly compromised for conidiation, while KO mutations in all RdPRs, QDE3 and QIP strongly affect ascosporogenesis. Analysis of trichothecenes mycotoxins in wheat kernels showed that the relative amount of deoxynivalenol (DON), calculated as [DON] per amount of fungal genomic DNA, was reduced in all spikes infected with RNAi mutants, suggesting the possibility that the fungal RNAi pathways affect Fgs DON production in wheat spikes. Moreover, gene silencing by exogenous target gene specific dsRNA (spray-induced gene silencing, SIGS) is dependent on fungal DCLs, AGOs, and QIP, but not on QDE3. Together these data show that in F. graminearum different key components of the RNAi machinery are crucial in different steps of fungal development and pathogenicity.",

    "abstract": "Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is a popular tool to identify underlying biological processes in clinical samples using their gene expression phenotypes. GSEA measures the enrichment of annotated gene sets that represent biological processes for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in clinical samples. GSEA may be suboptimal for functional gene sets, however, because DEGs from the expression dataset may not be functional genes per se but dysregulated genes perturbed by bona fide functional genes. To overcome this shortcoming, we developed network-based GSEA (NGSEA), which measures the enrichment score of functional gene sets using the expression difference of not only individual genes but also their neighbors in the functional network. We found that NGSEA outperformed GSEA in identifying pathway gene sets for matched gene expression phenotypes. We also observed that NGSEA substantially improved the ability to retrieve known anti-cancer drugs from patient-derived gene expression data using drug-target gene sets compared with another method, Connectivity Map. We also repurposed FDA-approved drugs using NGSEA and experimentally validated budesonide as a chemical with anti-cancer effects for colorectal cancer. We, therefore, expect that NGSEA will facilitate both pathway interpretation of gene expression phenotypes and anti-cancer drug repositioning. NGSEA is freely available at www.inetbio.org/ngsea.",
