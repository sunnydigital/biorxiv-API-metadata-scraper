    "abstract": "We investigated the presence of natural radioprotectors in food using a new technical modality that utilizes the insect Lasioderma serricorne as a radiosensitivity bioindicator to check radioprotection properties in minimally processed chickpeas. The insects were obtained from the entomological biotherium of the Laboratory of Radiobiology and Environment of CENA-USP. They were fed with an experimental diet and just when the first generation hatched completely, the experiments were conducted. The randomly chosen control diet, consisted of three parts of wheat germ, one part of brewers yeast, and a slice of French bread toasted in an oven previously set up for humidity control. The diet of chickpeas consists only of whole grains crushed in a mechanical grinder to obtain flour. The result was significant for the survival of insects (p<0.0001) reared on a diet of chickpeas compared to those reared on control diet irradiated with gamma rays from 60Co in the range of 5.0 to 1500 Gy. We presented statistical evidence that the chickpea diet has radioprotective properties in the insect for gamma rays.\\n\\nSUMMARY STATEMENTThe study is important because it shows that chickpea has protective properties against ionizing radiation, how to act against its biological effects and minimize them.",

    "abstract": "The human genome contains around 800 C2H2 Zinc Finger Proteins (ZFPs), and many of them are composed of long tandem arrays of zinc fingers. Current motif prediction models assume longer finger arrays correspond to longer DNA-binding motifs and higher specificity. However, recent experimental efforts to identify ZFP binding sites in vivo contradict this assumption, with many having short motifs. Here, we systematically test how multiple zinc fingers contribute to binding for three model ZFPs: Zinc Finger Y (ZFY), CTCF, and ZNF343. Using ZFY, which contains 13 fingers, we quantitatively characterize its binding specificity with several methods, including Affinity-seq, HT-SELEX, Spec-seq and fluorescence anisotropy, and find evidence for  dependent recognition where downstream fingers can recognize some extended motifs only in the presence of an intact core site. For the genomic insulator CTCF, additional high-throughput affinity measurements reveal that its upstream specificity profile depends on the strength of the core, violating presumed additivity and positionindependence. Moreover, the effect of different epigenetic modifications within the core site depends on the strength of flanking upstream site, providing new insight into how the previously identified intellectual disability-causing and cancer-related mutant R567W disrupts upstream recognition and deregulates CTCFs methylation sensitivity. Lastly, we used ZNF343 as example to show that a simple iterative motif analysis strategy based on a small set of prefixed cores can reveal the dependent relationship between cores and upstream motifs. These results establish that the current underestimation of ZFPs motif lengths is due to our lack of understanding of intrinsic properties of tandem zinc finger recognition, including irregular motif structure, variable spacing, and dependent recognition between sub-motifs. These results also motivate a need for better recognition models beyond additive, position-weight matrix to predict ZFP specificities, occupancies, and the molecular mechanisms of disease mutations.",

In transcriptomic applications, RNA-seq data have become dominating and have gradually replaced traditional microarray due to its reduced background noise and increased digital precision. Most existing machine learning methods are, however, designed for continuous intensities of microarray and are not suitable for RNA-seq count data. In this paper, we develop a negative binomial model via generalized linear model framework with double regularization for gene and covariate sparsity to accommodate three key elements: adequate modeling of count data with overdispersion, gene selection and adjustment for covariate effect.

    "abstract": "Next-generation DNA-sequencing (NGS) technologies, which are designed to streamline the acquisition of massive amounts of sequencing data, are nonetheless dependent on various preparative steps to generate DNA fragments of required concentration, purity, and average size (molecular weight). Current automated electrophoresis systems for DNA- and RNA-sample quality control, such as Agilents Bioanalyzer (R)and TapeStation (R) products, are costly to acquire and use; they also provide limited information for samples having broad size distributions. Here we describe a software tool that helps determine the size distribution of DNA fragments in an NGS library, or other DNA sample, based on gel-electrophoretic line profiles. The software, developed as an ImageJ plug-in, allows for straightforward processing of gel images, including lane selection and fitting of univariate functions to intensity distributions. The user selects the option of fitting either discrete profiles in cases where discrete gel bands are visible, or continuous profiles, having multiple bands buried under a single broad peak. The method requires only modest imaging capabilities and is a cost-effective, rigorous alternative characterization method to augment existing techniques for library quality control.",

    "abstract": "Latent Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) genomes rapidly acquire distinct patterns of the activating histone modification H3K4-me3 as well as repressive H3K27-me3 marks, a modification linked to transcriptional silencing by polycomb repressive complexes (PRC). Interestingly, PRCs have recently been reported to restrict viral gene expression in a number of other viral systems, suggesting they may play a broader role in controlling viral chromatin. If so, it is an intriguing possibility that latency establishment may result from viral subversion of polycomb-mediated host responses to exogenous DNA.\\n\\nTo investigate such scenarios we sought to establish whether rapid repression by PRC constitutes a general hallmark of herpesvirus latency. For this purpose, we performed a comparative epigenome analysis of KSHV and the related murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV-68). We demonstrate that, while latently replicating MHV-68 genomes readily acquire distinct patterns of activation-associated histone modifications upon de novo infection, they fundamentally differ in their ability to efficiently attract H3K27-me3 marks. Statistical analyses of ChIP-seq data from in vitro infected cells as well as in vivo latency reservoirs furthermore suggest that, whereas KSHV rapidly attracts PRCs in a genome-wide manner, H3K27-me3 acquisition by MHV-68 genomes may require spreading from initial seed sites to which PRC are recruited as the result of an inefficient or stochastic recruitment, and that immune pressure may be needed to select for latency pools harboring PRC-silenced episomes in vivo.\\n\\nUsing co-infection experiments and recombinant viruses, we also show that KSHVS ability to rapidly and efficiently acquire H3K27-me3 marks does not depend on the host cell environment or unique properties of the KSHV-encoded LANA protein, but rather requires specific cis-acting sequence features. We show that the non-canonical PRC1.1 component KDM2B, a factor which binds to unmethylated CpG motifs, is efficiently recruited to KSHV genomes, indicating that CpG island characteristics may constitute these features. In accord with the fact that, compared to MHV-68, KSHV genomes exhibit a fundamentally higher density of CpG motifs, we furthermore demonstrate efficient acquisition of H2AK119-ub by KSHV and H3K36-me2 by MHV-68 (but not vice versa), furthermore supporting the notion that KSHV genomes rapidly attract PRC1.1 complexes in a genome-wide fashion. Collectively, our results suggest that rapid PRC silencing is not a universal feature of viral latency, but that some viruses may rather have adopted distinct genomic features to specifically exploit default host pathways that repress epigenetically naive, CpG-rich DNA.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryDuring herpesvirus latency, viral genomes persists as partially repressed nuclear episomes which do not express genes required for progeny production. Latently infected cells not only form a reservoir of lifelong persistence but also represent the driving force in cancers associated with tumorigenic herpesviruses such as KSHV. Hence, it is fundamentally important to understand the mechanisms controlling latency. We have shown previously that latent KSHV episomes rapidly acquire H3K27-me3, a histone mark associated with polycomb repressive complexes (PRC). PRCs play a pivotal role in the control of developmental genes but are also involved in the pathogenesis of several tumors. We here investigated whether PRC-repression represents a general feature of herpesvirus latency. By performing side-by-side analyses of KSHV and the related MHV-68 we show that the latter indeed has a fundamentally lower propensity to acquire H3K27-me3, and that KSHVS ability to rapidly attract this mark is most likely the result of a specific sequence composition that promotes recruitment of non-canonical PRC1 (a complex which is important for the regulation of cellular CpG islands). Our results have widespread implications for nuclear DNA viruses and suggest that some viruses have specifically evolved to exploit common host responses to epigenetically naive DNA.",

    "abstract": "A central goal in microbial ecology is to simplify the extraordinary biodiversity that inhabits natural environments into ecologically coherent units. We present an integrative top-down analysis of over 700 bacterial communities sampled from water-filled beech tree-holes in the United Kingdom at distances between <5m to >100km, combining an analyses of community composition (16S rRNA sequencing) with assays of community functional capacity (exo-enzymatic activities, ATP production, CO2 dissipation and yield). The communities were grown in laboratory conditions in a complex growth medium, what allowed us to investigate the relationship between composition and function, excluding confounding environmental factors. We found a distance-decay trend in the similarity of the communities, and simulated data allowed us to reject the hypothesis that stochastic processes dominated the assembly of the communities, suggesting that niche effects prevailed. Consistent with this idea, clustering of communities lead us to identify six distinct community classes encompassing samples collected at often distant locations. Using structural equation modelling, we explored how functions were interrelated, demonstrating that a representative functional signature can be associated with each community class. We obtained a more mechanistic understanding of the classes using metagenomic predictions with PiCRUST. Notably, this approach allowed us to show that these classes contain distinct genetic repertoires reflecting community-level ecological strategies. We finally formulated an over-arching ecological hypothesis about how local conditions drive succession in these habitats. The ecological strategies resemble the classical distinction between r- and K-strategists and could be extrapolated to other systems, suggesting that a coarse grained picture of microbial ecological succession may be explained by relatively simple ecological mechanisms.",

This learning asymmetry could either reflect a preference for positive events in general, or be the upshot of a more general, and perhaps, ubiquitous, \\\"choice-confirmation\\\" bias, whereby agents preferentially integrate information that confirms their previous decision. We systematically compared these two theories with 3 experiments mixing free- and forced-choice conditions, featuring factual and counterfactual learning and varying action requirements across \\\"go\\\" and \\\"no-go\\\" trials. Computational analyses of learning rates showed clear and robust evidence in favour of the \\\"choice-confirmation\\\" theory: participants amplified positive prediction errors in free-choice conditions while being valence-neutral on forced-choice conditions. We suggest that a choice-confirmation bias is adaptive to the extent that it reinforces actions that are most likely to meet an individuals needs, i.e. freely chosen actions. In contrast, outcomes from unchosen actions are more likely to be treated impartially, i.e. to be assigned no special value in self-determined decisions.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTThe Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene (K\u2013Pg) boundary interval represents one of the most significant mass extinctions and ensuing biotic recoveries in Earth history. Earliest Paleocene fossil mammal faunas corresponding to the Puercan North American Land Mammal Age (NALMA) are thought to be highly endemic and potentially diachronous, necessitating precise chronostratigraphic controls at key fossil localities to constrain recovery dynamics in continental biotas following the K\u2013Pg mass extinction. The Laramide synorgenic sedimentary deposits within the Denver Basin preserve one of the most continuous and fossiliferous records of the K\u2013Pg boundary interval in North America. However, poor exposure in much of the Denver Basin makes it difficult to correlate between outcrops. In order to constrain fossil localities across the basin, previous studies have relied upon chronostratigraphic methods such as magnetostratigraphy. Here we present a new high-resolution magnetostratigraphy of 10 lithostratigraphic sections spanning the K\u2013Pg boundary interval at Corral Bluffs located east of Colorado Springs in the southern part of the Denver Basin. Fossil localities from Corral Bluffs have yielded limited dinosaur remains, mammal fossils assigned to the Puercan NALMA, and numerous fossil leaf localities. Palynological analysis identifying the K\u2013Pg boundary in three sections and two independent but nearly identical 206Pb/238U age estimates for the same volcanic ash, provide key temporal calibration points. Our paleomagnetic analysis has identified clear polarity reversal boundaries from Chron C30n to Chron C28r across the sections. It is now possible to place the fossil localities at Corral Bluffs within the broader basin-wide chronostratigraphic framework and evaluate them in the context of K\u2013Pg boundary extinction and recovery.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Cobamides, a uniquely diverse family of enzyme cofactors related to vitamin B12, are produced exclusively by bacteria and archaea but used in all domains of life. While it is widely accepted that cobamide-dependent organisms require specific cobamides for their metabolism, the biochemical mechanisms that make cobamides functionally distinct are largely unknown. Here, we examine the effects of cobamide structural variation on a model cobamide-dependent enzyme, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM). The in vitro binding affinity of MCM for cobamides can be dramatically influenced by small changes in the structure of the lower ligand of the cobamide, and binding selectivity differs between bacterial orthologs of MCM. In contrast, variations in the lower ligand have minor effects on MCM catalysis. Bacterial growth assays demonstrate that cobamide requirements of MCM in vitro largely correlate with in vivo cobamide dependence. This result underscores the importance of enzyme selectivity in the cobamide-dependent physiology of bacteria.",

Based on classic psychological theory we test how internal control beliefs impact the affective valuation of task outcomes, neural dynamics and ensuing behavioral preferences. In three consecutive studies with independent samples we show that dynamics in self-evaluative affect specifically increase when agents believe they caused a given task outcome. We demonstrate that these outcomes engage brain networks processing self-referential information in the cortical midline. Here, activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex tracks outcome valence regarding both success as well as internal control, and covaries with self-evaluative affect. These affective dynamics also relate to increased functional coupling between the ventral striatum and cortical midline structures. Finally, we show that self-evaluative affect promotes preferences for control, even at a monetary cost. Our investigations extend recent models of positive affect and well-being, and emphasize that control beliefs drive intrinsic motivation.",

    "abstract": "Learning environmental regularities allows predicting multiple dimensions of future events such as their location and semantic features. However, few studies have examined how multi-dimensional predictions are implemented, and mechanistic accounts are absent. Using eye tracking study, we evaluated whether predictions of object-location and object-category interact during the earliest stages of orientation. We presented stochastic series so that across four conditions, participants could predict either the location of the next image, its semantic category, both dimensions, or neither. Participants observed images in absence of any task. We modeled saccade latencies using ELATER, a rise-to-threshold model that accounts for accumulation rate (AR), variance of AR over trials, and decision threshold. The main findings were: 1) accumulation-rate scaled with the degree of surprise associated with location of target-presentation (confirmatory result); 2) predictability of semantic-category hindered latencies, but only when images were presented at a surprising location, suggesting a bottleneck in implementing joint predictions; 3) saccades to images that satisfied semantic expectations were associated with larger variance of accumulation-rate than saccades to semantically-surprising images, consistent with a richer repertoire of early evaluative processes for semantically-expected images. Joint impacts of location and target-identity regularity were also identified in analyses of anticipatory fixation offsets. The results indicate a strong interaction between the processing of regularities in object location and identity during stimulus-guided saccades, and suggest these regularities also impact anticipatory, non-stimulus-guided processes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThere is considerable interest in a dimensional transdiagnostic approach to psychiatry. Most transdiagnostic studies have derived factors based only on clinical symptoms, which might miss possible links between psychopathology, cognitive processes and personality traits. Furthermore, many psychiatric studies focus on higher-order association brain networks, thus neglecting the potential influence of huge swaths of the brain.\\n\\nMethodsA multivariate data-driven approach (partial least squares; PLS) was utilized to identify latent components linking a large set of clinical, cognitive and personality measures to whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) patterns across 224 participants. The participants were either healthy (N=110) or diagnosed with bipolar disorder (N=40), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (N=37), schizophrenia (N=29) or schizoaffective disorder (N=8). In contrast to traditional case-control analyses, the diagnostic categories were not utilized in the PLS analysis, but were helpful for interpreting the components.\\n\\nResultsOur analyses revealed three latent components corresponding to general psychopathology, cognitive dysfunction and impulsivity. Each component was associated with a unique whole-brain RSFC signature and shared across all participants. The components were robust across multiple control analyses and replicated using independent task functional magnetic resonance imaging data from the same participants. Strikingly, all three components featured connectivity alterations within the somatosensory-motor network, and its connectivity with subcortical structures and cortical executive networks.\\n\\nConclusionsWe identified three distinct dimensions with dissociable (but overlapping) whole-brain RSFC signatures across healthy individuals and individuals with psychiatric illness, providing potential intermediate phenotypes that span across diagnostic categories. Our results suggest expanding the focus of psychiatric neuroscience beyond higher-order brain networks.",

    "abstract": "In the brain, increased neural activity is correlated with an increase of cerebral blood flow and increased tissue oxygenation. However, how cerebral oxygen dynamics are controlled in the behaving animals remains unclear. Here, we investigated to what extent the cerebral oxygenation varies during natural behaviors that change the whole-body homeostasis, specifically exercise. We measured oxygen levels in the cortex of awake, head-fixed mice during locomotion using polarography, spectroscopy, and two-photon phosphorescence lifetime measurements of oxygen sensors. We found that locomotion significantly and globally increases cerebral oxygenation, specifically in areas involved in locomotion, as well as in the frontal cortex and the olfactory bulb. The oxygenation increase persisted when neural activity and functional hyperemia were blocked, occurred both in the tissue and in arteries feeding the brain, and was tightly correlated with respiration rate and the phase of respiration cycle. Thus, respiration provides a dynamic pathway for modulating cerebral oxygenation.",

    "abstract": "Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration is the root cause for vision loss in glaucoma as well as in other forms of optic neuropathies. Genetic analysis indicated abnormal mitochondrial quality control (MQC) as a major risk factor for optic neuropathies. However, nothing is known on how MQC regulates human retinal ganglion cell (hRGC) health and survival. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) provide opportunity to differentiate hRGCs and understand the abnormal MQC associated hRGC degeneration in great detail. Degradation of damaged mitochondria is a very critical step of MQC, here we have used stem cell derived hRGCs to understand the damaged mitochondrial degradation pathways for hRGC survival. Using pharmacological methods, we have investigated the role of the proteasomal and endo-lysosomal pathways in degrading damaged mitochondria in hRGCs and their precursor stem cells. We find that upon mitochondrial damage with the proton uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP), hRGCs more efficiently degraded mitochondria than their precursor stem cells. We further identified that for degrading damaged mitochondria, stem cells predominantly use the ubiquitine-proteasome system (UPS) while hRGCs use the endo-lysosomal pathway. UPS inhibition causes apoptosis in stem cells, while hRGC viability is dependent on the endo-lysosomal pathway but not on the UPS pathway. This suggests manipulation of the endo-lysosomal pathway could be therapeutically relevant for RGC protection in treating glaucoma. Endo-lysosome dependent cell survival is also conserved for other human neurons as differentiated human cerebral cortical neurons also degenerated upon endo-lysosomal inhibition but not for the proteasome inhibition.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTUsing human stem cells we have shown a switch in the mitochondrial degradation pathway during hRGC differentiation where endo-lysosomal pathway becomes the predominant pathway for cellular homeostasis and hRGC survival which is also true for human cortical neurons. These findings suggest manipulation of the endo-lysosomal pathway could be therapeutically relevant for RGC protection in treating glaucoma as well as for other neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Mutation is a critical mechanism by which evolution explores the functional landscape of proteins. Despite our ability to experimentally inflict mutations at will, it remains difficult to link sequence-level perturbations to systems-level responses. Here, we present a framework centered on measuring changes in the free energy of the system to link individual mutations in an allosteric transcriptional repressor to the parameters which govern its response. We find the energetic effects of the mutations can be categorized into several classes which have characteristic curves as a function of the inducer concentration. We experimentally test these diagnostic predictions using the well-characterized LacI repressor of Escherichia coli, probing several mutations in the DNA binding and inducer binding domains. We find that the change in gene expression due to a point mutation can be captured by modifying only a subset of the model parameters that describe the respective domain of the wild-type protein. These parameters appear to be insulated, with mutations in the DNA binding domain altering only the DNA affinity and those in the inducer binding domain altering only the allosteric parameters. Changing these subsets of parameters tunes the free energy of the system in a way that is concordant with theoretical expectations. Finally, we show that the induction profiles and resulting free energies associated with pairwise double mutants can be predicted with quantitative accuracy given knowledge of the single mutants, providing an avenue for identifying and quantifying epistatic interactions.\\n\\nSummaryWe present a biophysical model of allosteric transcriptional regulation that directly links the location of a mutation within a repressor to the biophysical parameters that describe its behavior. We explore the phenotypic space of a repressor with mutations in either the inducer binding or DNA binding domains. Using the LacI repressor in E. coli, we make sharp, falsifiable predictions and use this framework to generate a null hypothesis for how double mutants behave given knowledge of the single mutants. Linking mutations to the parameters which govern the system allows for quantitative predictions of how the free energy of the system changes as a result, permitting coarse graining of high-dimensional data into a single-parameter description of the mutational consequences.",

    "abstract": "Forces generated by the actomyosin cytoskeleton are key contributors to the generation of tissue shape. Within the cell, the actomyosin cytoskeleton organizes in different types of networks, each of them performing distinct roles. In addition, although they normally localize to precise regions of the cells, they are rarely independent and often their dynamics influence each other. In fact, the reorganization of a given structure can promote the formation of another, conversions that govern many morphogenetic processes. In addition, maintenance of a specific actomyosin network organization in a differentiated tissue might be equally important. Failure to do so could lead to undesired cell state transitions, which in turn would have drastic consequences on the homeostasis of the tissue. Still, little is known about the mechanisms that ensure controlled transitions between actomyosin networks during morphogenesis or their maintenance in a differentiated tissue. Here, we use the Drosophila follicular epithelium to show that cell-ECM interactions mediated by integrins are necessary for the establishment and maintenance of the different actomyosin networks present in these epithelial cells. Elimination of integrins in a group of follicle cells results in changes in the F-actin levels and physical properties of their intracellular actomyosin networks. Integrin mutant follicle cells have reduced number of basal stress fibers. They also show increased cortical F-actin levels and tension, which interferes with proper basal surface growth. Finally, clonal elimination of integrins also triggers non-autonomous behavioural changes in neighbouring wild types cells, which now reorganize their actin cytoskeleton and spread and overlay the mutant ones. Based on these results, we propose that cell-ECM interactions mediated by integrins regulate epithelia morphogenesis and homesostasis by preserving the different types of intracellular actin networks.",

Due to the poor optical sectioning capability of wide-field microscopy, the polarization modulation signals are susceptible to the neighboring fluorophores. The missing cone of wide field optical transfer function induces vast out-of-focus background, resulting in biased polarization orientation and decrease polarization factor. Here, we apply polarized structured illumination to achieve polarization modulation imaging with optical sectioning, and simultaneously measure the lipid polarity with two-color ratiometric imaging. Our results demonstrate a significant increase in measurement accuracy of not only the dipole orientations but also the wobbling behavior of the ensemble dipole. Compared to the conventional confocal polarization imaging, our method obtains an order-of-magnitude faster imaging speed, capturing the fast dynamics of subcellular structures in live cells.",

Here, we demonstrate that activating mutations in the granulocyte colony stimulating factor receptor (CSF3R), cooperate with loss of function mutations in the transcription factor CEBPA to promote acute leukemia development. This finding of mutation-synergy is broadly applicable other mutations that activate the JAK/STAT pathway or disrupt CEBPA function (i.e. activating mutations in JAK3 and Core Binding Factor translocations). The interaction between these distinct classes of mutations occurs at the level of myeloid lineage enhancers where mutant CEBPA prevents activation of subset of differentiation associated enhancers. To confirm this enhancer-dependent mechanism, we demonstrate that CEBPA mutations must occur as the initial event in AML initiation, confirming predictions from clinical sequencing data. This improved mechanistic understanding will facilitate therapeutic development targeting the intersection of oncogene cooperativity.",

    "abstract": "In metazoans, retromer (VPS26/VPS35/VPS29) associates with sorting nexin (SNX) proteins to form coats on endosomal tubules and sort cargo proteins to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) or plasma membrane. This core complex is highly conserved from yeast to humans, but molecular mechanisms of metazoan retromer assembly remain undefined. Here we combine single particle cryo-electron microscopy with biophysical methods to uncover multiple oligomer structures formed by mammalian retromer. Two-dimensional class averages in ice reveal the retromer heterotrimer; dimers of trimers; tetramers of trimers; and flat chains. These species are further supported by biophysical studies in solution. We provide cryo-EM reconstructions of all species, including pseudo-atomic resolution detail for key sub-structures. Multi-body refinement demonstrates how retromer heterotrimers and dimers adopt a range of conformations. Our structures identify a flexible yet highly conserved electrostatic interface in dimers formed by interactions between VPS35 subunits. We generate a structure-based mutant to disrupt this key interface in vitro and introduce equivalent mutations into S. cerevisiae to demonstrate the mutant exhibits a cargo sorting defect. Together, structures and complementary functional data in budding yeast imply a conserved assembly interface across eukaryotes. These data further suggest mammalian retromer acts as an adaptable and plastic scaffold that accommodates interactions with different SNXs to sort multiple cargoes from endosomes their final destinations.",
