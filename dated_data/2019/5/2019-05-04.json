    "abstract": "For ecological research to make important contributions towards understanding and managing temporally-variable global change processes, such as responses to land-use and climatic change, we must have effective and comparable ways to quantify and analyse compositional change over time in biological communities. These changes are the sum of local colonisation and extinction events, or changes in the biomass and relative abundance of taxa within and among samples. We conducted a quantitative review of currently available methods for the analysis of multivariate datasets collected at temporal intervals. This review identified the need for the application of quantitative, hypothesis-based approaches to understand temporal change in community composition, particularly for small datasets with less than 15 temporal replicates. To address this gap, we: (1) conceptually present how temporal patterns in community dynamics can be framed as specific, testable hypotheses; (2) provide three fully-worked case-studies, complete with R code, demonstrating multivariate analysis methods for temporal hypothesis testing and pattern visualisation; and (3) present a road map for testing specific, quantitative hypotheses relating to the underlying mechanisms of temporal community dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are known to potentiate tumor initiation and maintenance in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC). Increasing evidences suggest that CD44highCD24low population in OSCC are potential CSCs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as crucial players in tumor development. However, their role in maintenance of OSCC stem cells remains unclear. Here we report that CD44highCD24low population within OSCC cells and primary HNSCC tumors have an elevated expression of miR-146a. Moreover, over-expression of miR-146a results in enhanced stemness phenotype by augmenting CD44highCD24low population. We demonstrate that miR-146a induces stemness by stabilizing {beta}-catenin with concomitant loss of E-cadherin and CD24. Interestingly, CD24 is identified as a novel functional target of miR-146a and ectopic expression of CD24 abrogates miR-146a driven potential CSC phenotype. Mechanistic analysis reveals that higher CD24 levels inhibit AKT phosphorylation leading to {beta}-catenin degradation. Using stably expressing miR-146a/CD24 OSCC cell lines, we also validate that the miR-146a/ CD24/AKT loop significantly alters tumorigenic ability in vivo. Furthermore, we confirmed that {beta}-catenin trans-activates miR-146a, thereby forming a positive feedback loop contributing to stem cell maintenance. Collectively, our study demonstrates that miR-146a regulate CSCs in OSCC through CD24-AKT-{beta}-catenin axis.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIMiR-146a induces cancer stem cell characteristics in OSCC by targeting CD24\\nC_LIO_LICD24 abrogates miR-146a mediated stemness via {beta}-catenin degradation in non-CSCs\\nC_LIO_LIAkt/Wnt pathway is critical for sustenance of miR-146a driven potential CSCs\\nC_LIO_LIThe miR-146a/CD24/AKT loop significantly alters tumorigenic ability in vivo\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "When migratory T cells encounter antigen presenting cells (APCs), they arrest and form radially symmetric, stable intercellular junctions termed immunological synapses which facilitate exchange of crucial biochemical information and are critical for T cell immunity. While the cellular processes underlying synapse formation have been well-characterized, those that maintain the symmetry, and thereby the stability of the synapse remain unknown. Here we identify an antigen-triggered mechanism that actively promotes T cell synapse symmetry by generating cytoskeletal tension in the plane of the synapse through focal nucleation of actin via Wiskott -Aldrich syndrome Protein (WASP), and contraction of the resultant actin filaments by myosin II. Following T cell activation, WASP is degraded, leading to cytoskeletal rearrangement and tension decay, which result in synapse breaking. Thus, our study identifies and characterizes a mechanical program within otherwise highly motile T cells that sustains the symmetry and stability of the T cell-APC synaptic contact.",

    "abstract": "It is well established that emotionally salient stimuli evoke greater visual cortex activation than neutral ones, and can distract attention from competing tasks. Yet less is known about underlying neurobiological processes. As a proxy of population level biased competition, EEG steady-state visual evoked potentials are sensitive to competition effects from salient stimuli. Here we wished to examine whether individual differences in norepinephrine activity play a role in emotionally-biased competition.\\n\\nOur previous research has found robust effects of a common variation in the ADRA2B gene, coding for alpha2B norepinephrine (NE) receptors, on emotional modulation of attention and memory. In the present study, EEG was collected while 87 carriers of the ADRA2B deletion variant and 95 non-carriers (final sample) performed a change detection task in which target gratings (gabor patches) were superimposed directly over angry, happy, and neutral faces. Participants indicated the number of phase changes (0-3) in the target. Overlapping targets and distractors were flickered at a distinct driving frequencies. Relative EEG power for faces vs. targets at the driving frequency served as an index of cortical resources allocated to each of the competing stimuli. Deletion carriers and non-carriers were randomly assigned to Discovery and Replication samples and reliability of results across samples was assessed before the groups were combined for greater power.\\n\\nOverall happy faces evoked higher competition than angry or neutral faces; however, we observed no hypothesized effects of ADRA2B. Increased competition from happy faces was not due to the effect of low-level visual features or individuals low in social anxiety. Our results indicate that emotionally biased competition during sustained attention, while reliably observed in young adults, is not influenced by commonly observed individual differences linked to NE receptor function. They further indicate an overall pattern of affectively-biased competition for happy faces, which we interpret in relation to previously observed boundary conditions.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental aim of adaptation genomics is to identify polymorphisms that underpin variation in fitness traits. In D. melanogaster latitudinal life-history clines exist on multiple continents and make an excellent system for dissecting the genetics of adaptation. We have previously identified numerous clinal SNPs in insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS), a pathway known from mutant studies to affect life history. However, the effects of natural variants in this pathway remain poorly understood. Here we investigate how two clinal alternative alleles at foxo, a transcriptional effector of IIS, affect fitness components (viability, size, starvation resistance, fat content). We assessed this polymorphism from the North American cline by reconstituting outbred populations, fixed for either the low- or high-latitude allele, from inbred DGRP lines. Since diet and temperature modulate IIS, we phenotyped alleles across two temperatures (18{degrees}C, 25{degrees}C) and two diets differing in sugar source and content. Consistent with clinal expectations, the high-latitude allele conferred larger body size and reduced wing loading. Alleles also differed in starvation resistance and expression of InR, a transcriptional target of FOXO. Allelic reaction norms were mostly parallel, with few GxE interactions. Together, our results suggest that variation in IIS makes a major contribution to clinal life-history adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Brain injury activates complex inflammatory signals in dying neurons, surviving neurons, and glia. Here, we establish that inflammation regulates the regeneration of photoreceptors in the zebrafish retina and determine the cellular expression and function of the inflammatory protease, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (Mmp-9), during this regenerative neurogenesis. Following sterile photoreceptor ablation anti-inflammatory treatment suppresses both the number of injury-induced progenitors and regenerated photoreceptors. Upon photoreceptor injury, mmp-9 is induced in Muller glia, the intrinsic retinal stem cell, and Muller glia-derived photoreceptor progenitors. Deleting mmp-9 results in over production of injury-induced progenitors and regenerated photoreceptors, but over time the absence of Mmp-9 compromises the maturation and survival of the regenerated cones. Anti-inflammatory treatment in mutants rescues the defects in cone maturation and survival. These data provide a link between injury-induced inflammation in the vertebrate CNS, Mmp-9 function during photoreceptor regeneration and the requirement of Mmp-9 for the survival of regenerated cones.\n\nSignificance StatementThe innate immune system is activated by neuronal death, and recent studies demonstrate that in zebrafish neuroinflammation is required for neuronal regeneration. The roles of inflammatory cytokines are being investigated, however, the function of the inflammatory protease, matrix metalloprotease Mmp-9, in neuronal regeneration is unknown. We show herein that in adult zebrafish retinal inflammation governs the proliferative phase of the stem cell-based regeneration of rod and cone photoreceptors and determine the specific roles for Mmp-9 in photoreceptor regeneration. This study provides the first mechanistic insights into the potential role of Mmp-9 and serves to link neuroinflammation, stem cell-based regeneration of photoreceptors and human photoreceptor disease.",

Behavioral responses to novel stimuli, or exploratory behavior, can differ strongly between closely related species; however, the ecological and evolutionary factors underlying these differences are not well understood, in part because most comparative investigations have focused on only two species. In this study, we investigate exploratory behavior across 23 species in a previously untested vertebrate system, Lake Malawi cichlid fishes, which comprises hundreds of phenotypically diverse species that have diverged in the past one million years. We investigate behavioral variation across species, across microhabitats, and across environmental contexts. We find strong species differences in behavior that are associated with microhabitat, demonstrate that intermediate microhabitats are associated with higher levels of exploratory behavior, show that patterns of behavioral covariation across contexts are characteristic of modular complex traits, and contrast Malawi cichlid data with behavioral data from selectively bred high-and low-exploratory zebrafish.

Despite the importance of this connection, the effects of altered placental signaling on the maternal brain are understudied. Here, we show that placental dysfunction alters gene expression in the maternal brain, with the potential to affect maternal behavior. Using a cross between the house mouse and the Algerian mouse in which hybrid placental development is abnormal, we sequenced late gestation placental and maternal medial preoptic area transcriptomes and quantified differential expression and placenta-maternal brain co-expression between normal and hybrid pregnancies. The expression of Fmn1, Drd3, Caln1 and Ctsr was significantly altered in the brains of females exposed to hybrid placentas. Most strikingly, expression patterns of placenta-specific gene families and Drd3 in the brains of house mouse females carrying hybrid litters matched those of female Algerian mice, the paternal species in the cross. Our results indicate that the paternally-derived placental genome can influence the expression of maternal-fetal communication genes, including placental hormones, suggesting an effect of the offsprings father on the mothers brain.",

    "abstract": "Transparent research in musculoskeletal imaging is fundamental to reliably investigate diseases such as knee osteoarthritis (OA), a chronic disease impairing femoral knee cartilage. To study cartilage degeneration, researchers have developed algorithms to segment femoral knee cartilage from magnetic resonance (MR) images and to measure cartilage morphology and relaxometry. The majority of these algorithms are not publicly available or require advanced programming skills to be compiled and run. However, to accelerate discoveries and findings, it is crucial to have open and reproducible workflows. We present pyKNEEr, a framework for open and reproducible research on femoral knee cartilage from MR images. pyKNEEr is written in python, uses Jupyter notebook as a user interface, and is available on GitHub with a GNU GPLv3 license. It is composed of three modules: 1) image preprocessing to standardize spatial and intensity characteristics, 2) femoral knee cartilage segmentation for intersubject, multimodal, and longitudinal acquisitions, and 3) analysis of cartilage morphology and relaxometry. Each module contains one or more Jupyter notebooks with narrative, code, visualizations, and dependencies to reproduce computational environments. pyKNEEr facilitates transparent image-based research of femoral knee cartilage because of its ease of installation and use, and its versatility for publication and sharing among researchers. Finally, due to its modular structure, pyKNEEr favors code extension and algorithm comparison. We tested our reproducible workflows with experiments that also constitute an example of transparent research with pyKNEEr. We provide links to executed notebooks and executable environments for immediate reproducibility of our findings.",

It comprises hundreds of protein homologs that self-assemble in space to form an icosahedral structure. Despite its significance in enhancing CO2 fixation and potentials in bioengineering applications, the formation of carboxysomes and their structural composition, stoichiometry and adaptation to cope with environmental changes remain unclear. Here we use live-cell single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, coupled with confocal and electron microscopy, to decipher the absolute protein stoichiometry and organizational variability of single {beta}-carboxysomes in the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942. We determine the physiological abundance of individual building blocks within the icosahedral carboxysome. We further find that the protein stoichiometry, diameter, localization and mobility patterns of carboxysomes in cells depend sensitively on the microenvironmental levels of CO2 and light intensity during cell growth, revealing cellular strategies of dynamic regulation. These findings, also applicable to other bacterial microcompartments and macromolecular self-assembling systems, advance our knowledge of the principles that mediate carboxysome formation and structural modulation.

Despite six decades of progress, state-of-the-art techniques cannot annotate 1/3 of microbial protein sequences, hampering our ability to exploit sequences collected from diverse organisms. In this paper, we explore an alternative methodology based on deep learning that learns the relationship between unaligned amino acid sequences and their functional annotations across all 17929 families of the Pfam database. Using the Pfam seed sequences we establish rigorous benchmark assessments that use both random and clustered data splits to control for potentially confounding sequence similarities between train and test sequences. Using Pfam full, we report convolutional networks that are significantly more accurate and computationally efficient than BLASTp, while learning sequence features such as structural disorder and transmembrane helices. Our model co-locates sequences from unseen families in embedding space, allowing sequences from novel families to be accurately annotated. These results suggest deep learning models will be a core component of future protein function prediction tools.",

    "abstract": "Nutrition exerts profound effects on health and dietary interventions are commonly used to treat diseases of metabolic etiology. Although cancer has a substantial metabolic component, the principles that define whether nutrition may be used to influence tumour outcome are unclear. Nevertheless, it is established that targeting metabolic pathways with pharmacological agents or radiation can sometimes lead to controlled therapeutic outcomes. In contrast, whether specific dietary interventions could influence the metabolic pathways that are targeted in standard cancer therapies is not known. We now show that dietary restriction of methionine (MR), an essential amino acid, and the reduction of which has aging and obesogenic properties, influences cancer outcome through controlled and reproducible changes to one carbon metabolism. This pathway metabolizes methionine and further is the target of a host of cancer interventions involving chemotherapy and radiation. MR produced therapeutic responses in chemoresistant RAS-driven colorectal cancer patient derived xenografts and autochthonous KRASG12D+/-;TP53-/- -driven soft tissue sarcomas resistant to radiation. Metabolomics revealed the therapeutic mechanisms to occur through tumor cell autonomous effects on the flux through one carbon metabolism that impacted redox and nucleotide metabolism, thus interacting with the antimetabolite or radiation intervention. Finally, in a controlled and tolerated feeding study in humans, MR resulted in similar effects on systemic metabolism as obtained in responsive mice. These findings provide evidence that a targeted dietary manipulation can affect specific tumor cell metabolism to mediate broad aspects of cancer outcome.",

In their natural environments, ranging from human organs to industrial pipelines, biofilms have evolved to grow robustly under significant fluid shear. Despite intense practical and theoretical interest, it is unclear how strong fluid flow alters the local and global architectures of biofilms. Here, we combine highly time-resolved single-cell live imaging with 3D multi-scale modeling to investigate the mechanisms by which flow affects the dynamics of all individual cells in growing biofilms. Our experiments and cell-based simulations reveal three quantitatively different growth phases in strong external flow, and the transitions between them. In the initial stages of biofilm development, flow induces a downstream gradient in cell orientation, causing asymmetrical droplet-like biofilm shapes. In the later developmental stages, when the majority of cells are sheltered from the flow by the surrounding extracellular matrix, buckling-induced cell verticalization in the biofilm core restores radially symmetric biofilm growth, in agreement with predictions of a 3D continuum model.",

    "abstract": "Given the general importance of lipids in health and disease, there is a need for efficient technology that broadly profiles and quantitates the lipid composition of complex mixtures. In this study, we developed and quantitatively evaluated a platform that simultaneously profiles both lipids and polar metabolites from the same sample. This method was achieved by using a methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) extraction and employing two liquid chromatography methods coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). This workflow enabled detection and semi-quantitation of over 300 polar metabolites as well as over 300 lipids with comprehensive coverage of diverse chemical classes. Using cultured mammalian cells as an example, we report the quantitative properties of the platform including the sensitivity and linear range. The lipidomics strategy was further applied to characterize changes to lipid metabolism upon treatment with metformin to human ovarian cancer cells. Of the 256 detected lipids, 99 lipids (39%) significantly increased, 11 lipids (4%) were significantly reduced and 146 lipids (57%) remain unchanged in metformin-treated cells. Stable isotope tracing of carbon into lipids using [13C6]-glucose further measured the contribution of de novo fatty acid synthesis to the total fatty acid pool. In summary, the platform enabled the semi-quantitative assessment of hundreds of lipid species and associated carbon incorporation from glucose in a high throughput manner.",

    "abstract": "Agonist binding to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) leads to conformational changes in the transmembrane region that activate cytosolic signaling pathways. Al-though high resolution structures of different receptor states are available, atomistic details of the allosteric signalling across the membrane remain elusive. We calculated free energy landscapes of the {beta}2 adrenergic receptors activation using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations in an optimized string of swarms framework, which sheds new light on how microswitches govern the equilibrium between conformational states. Contraction of the extracellular binding site in the presence of the agonist BI-167107 is obligatorily coupled to conformational changes in a connector motif located in the core of the transmembrane region. The connector is probabilistically coupled to the conformation of the intracellular region. An active connector promotes desolvation of a buried cavity, a twist of the conserved NPxxY motif, and an interaction between two conserved tyrosines in transmembrane helices 5 and 7 (Y-Y motif), which leads to a larger population of active-like states at the G protein binding site. This coupling is augmented by protonation of the strongly conserved Asp792.50. The agonist binding site hence communicates with the intracellular region via a cascade of locally connected microswitches. Characterization of these can be used to understand how ligands stabilize distinct receptor states and contribute to development drugs with specific signaling properties. The developed simulation protocol is likely transferable to other class A GPCRs.\n\nGraphical TOC Entry\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=82 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/627026v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (24K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dfcfb5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bdaf81org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14d74e6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@35cea9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Tne capability to handle highly heterogeneous molecular assemblies in a consistent manner is among the greatest challenges faced when deriving simulation parameters. This is particularly the case for coarse-grained simulations in which chemical functional groups are lumped into effective interaction centers for which transferability between different chemical environments is not guaranteed. Here we introduce the parameterization of a set of CG phospholipids compatible with the latest version of the SIRAH force field for proteins. The newly introduced lipid species include different acylic chain lengths, partial unsaturation, as well as polar and acidic head groups that show a very good reproduction of structural membrane determinants, as areas per lipid, thickness, order parameter, etc., and their dependence with temperature. Simulation of membrane proteins showed unprecedented accuracy in the unbiased description of the thickness-dependent membrane-protein orientation in systems where this information is experimentally available (namely, the SarcoEndoplasmic Reticulum Calcium -SERCA-pump and its regulator Phospholamban). The interactions that lead to this faithful reproduction can be traced down to single amino acid-lipid interaction level and show full agreement with biochemical data present in the literature. Finally, the present parameterization is implemented in the GROMACS and AMBER simulation packages facilitating its use to a wide portion of the Biocomputing community.",

Myxobacteria have emerged as a useful study model to investigate multicellular evolution and development. Here, we propose a multiscale model that considers cellular adhesion and movement, molecular regulatory networks (MRNs), and cell-to-cell communication to study the emergence of cell fate determination and spatial patterning of Myxococcus xanthus fruiting bodies. The model provides a dynamic accounting of the roles of MRN multistability, intercellular communication and conglomerate size in determining cell fate and patterning during M. xanthus development. It also suggests that for cell fate determination and patterning to occur, the cell aggregate must surpass a minimum size. The model also allows us to contrast alternative scenarios for the C-signal mechanism and provides stronger support for an indirect effect (as a diffusible molecule) than a direct one (as a membrane protein).",

    "abstract": "Parasitic helminths infect over a billion humans. To survive in the low oxygen environment of their hosts, these parasites use unusual anaerobic metabolism. This requires Rhodoquinone (RQ), an electron carrier that is made by very few animal species -- crucially it is not present in any parasitic hosts. RQ synthesis is thus an ideal target for anthelmintics but little is known about how RQ is made and no drugs are known to block RQ synthesis. C.elegans makes RQ and can use RQ-dependent metabolic pathways -- here, we use C.elegans genetics to identify the pathway for RQ synthesis and show that C.elegans requires RQ for survival in hypoxic conditions. Finally, we establish a robust assay for drugs that block RQ-dependent metabolism. This study identifies for the first time how RQ is made in any animal and establishes a novel assay that can drive the development of a new class of anthelmintic drugs.",

    "abstract": "PurposeNeurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers disease cause changes and disruption to cortical microstructure and architecture. Diffusion MRI (dMRI) could potentially be sensitive to such changes. There is a growing interest in modeling of human cortical areas using a combination of quantitative MRI and 3D microscopy. The purpose of this study was to quantitatively characterize the cytoarchitecture of human cortical tissue from 3D fluorescence microscopy to simulate diffusion MRI (dMRI) signal in the cortex to better understand its diffusion signal characteristics.\\n\\nMethodsDiffusion of water molecules and dMRI signal were simulated by an indirect geometry based method and a direct voxel based method in microstructural details extracted from microscopy of cortex. Additionally, residence times of diffusing spins inside voxel volumes were considered to set effective resolution limits. Mean diffusivity (MD) and kurtosis (MK) were calculated for variable cell and neurite densities, sizes and diffusion times under realistic values for permeability and free diffusion.\\n\\nResultsBoth simulation methods could efficiently and accurately simulate dMRI signals with fractional anisotropy, diffusion coefficient and kurtosis in agreement with previous reports. Simulated MD and MK showed changes with increasing diffusion times specific to cortical cell density and sizes, with MK showing the highest sensitivity. Intra-voxel residence times with increasing diffusion times showed that the effective dMRI resolution approaches the thickness of cortical layers.\\n\\nConclusionsMonte Carlo simulations based on 3D microscopy data enable estimating changes in MD and MK over diffusion times and are sensitive to cortical cytoarchitecture and its possible changes in neurodegenerative disease. When considering layer-specific cortical dMRI, effective resolution due to residence times is an important concern.",

Here we show that this oncogene is a regulator of the alternative RNA splicing for a sub-set of genes in the leukemia cells. We found two primary mechanisms underlying changes in the production of RNA isoforms: (i) RUNX1/RUNX1T1-mediated regulation of alternative transcription start sites selection in target genes, and (ii) direct or indirect control of the expression of the genes encoding splicing factors. The first mechanism leads to the expression of RNA isoforms with alternative structure of the 5-UTR regions. The second mechanism generates alternative transcripts with new junctions between internal cassettes and constitutive exons. We also show that RUNX1/RUNX1T1-mediated differential splicing affects several functional groups of genes and produces proteins with unique conserved domain structures. In summary, this study reveals a novel layer of RUNX1/RUNX1T1-dependent transcriptome organization in t(8;21)-positive acute myeloid leukemia.",

    "abstract": "Signaling pathways are key regulators of adult stem cell homeostasis and underlying mechanisms are often deregulated in cancers. Recent studies of epithelial tumors have involved OvoL/Svb transcription factors, which produce isoforms with antagonistic activities. Here we show that Svb, the unique OvoL factor in Drosophila, directly integrates multiple signaling inputs to coordinate the behavior of adult intestinal stem cell lineage. Under steady state, Svb mediates Wnt and EGFR signaling to ensure stem cell renewal and progenitor survival. This requires the post-translational processing of Svb into a transcriptional activator by Polished rice (Pri) regulatory peptides, under the regulation of ecdysone signaling. In response to PDM1, Svb expression is specifically maintained in enterocytes where it acts as a transcriptional repressor sufficient to override mitogenic signals and impose differentiation. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the OvoL/Svb transcriptional switch controls the balance between stem cell survival, self-renewal and differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Like many viruses, rotavirus (RV) dysregulates calcium homeostasis by elevating cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]cyt) and decreasing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores. While an overall, monophasic increase in [Ca2+]cyt during RV infection has been shown, the nature of the RV-induced aberrant calcium signals and how they manifest over time at the single-cell level have not been characterized. Thus, we generated cell lines and human intestinal enteroids (HIEs) stably expressing cytosolic and/or ER-targeted genetically-encoded calcium indicators to characterize calcium signaling throughout RV infection by time-lapse imaging. We found that RV induces highly dynamic [Ca2+]cyt signaling that manifest as hundreds of discrete [Ca2+]cyt spikes, which increase during peak infection. Knockdown of nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4) attenuates the [Ca2+]cyt spikes, consistent with its role in dysregulating calcium homeostasis. RV-induced [Ca2+]cyt spikes were primarily from ER calcium release and were attenuated by inhibiting the store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) channel Orai1. RV-infected HIEs also exhibited prominent [Ca2+]cyt spikes that were attenuated by inhibiting SOCE, underlining the relevance of these [Ca2+]cyt spikes to gastrointestinal physiology and role of SOCE in RV pathophysiology. Thus, our discovery that RV increases [Ca2+]cyt by dynamic Ca2+ signaling, establishes a new, paradigm-shifting understanding of the spatial and temporal complexity of virus-induced Ca2+ signaling.",

The loss of mitochondria in the senescent human CD8+ T cells has knock-on consequences for nutrient usage, metabolism and function. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to both cellular senescence and ageing, however it is still unclear whether mitochondria play a causal role in senescence. Our data shows that reducing mitochondrial function in human CD4+ T cells, through the addition of low dose rotenone, causes the generation of a CD4+ T cell with a CD8+ -like phenotype. Therefore we wish to propose that it is the inherent metabolic stability that governs the susceptibility to an immunosenescent phenotype.",
