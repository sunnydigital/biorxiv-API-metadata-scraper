    "abstract": "Darwinian evolution consists of the gradual transformation of heritable quantitative traits due to natural selection and the input of random variation by mutation. Here, we use a quantitative genetics approach to investigate the coevolution of multiple traits under selection, mutation, and limited dispersal. We track the dynamics of trait means and variance-covariances between traits that experience frequency-dependent selection. Assuming a multivariate-normal trait distribution, we recover classical dynamics of quantitative genetics, as well as stability and evolutionary branching conditions of invasion analyses, except that due to limited dispersal, selection depends on indirect fitness effects and relatedness. In particular, correlational selection that associates different traits within-individuals depends on the fitness effects of such associations between-individuals. These kin selection effects can be as relevant as pleiotropy for correlation between traits. We illustrate this with an example of the coevolution of two social traits whose association within-individual is costly but synergistically beneficial between-individuals. As dispersal becomes limited and relatedness increases, associations between-traits between-individuals become increasingly targeted by correlational selection. Consequently, the trait distribution goes from being bimodal with a negative correlation under panmixia to unimodal with a positive correlation under limited dispersal. More broadly, our approach can help understand the evolution of intra-specific variation.",

    "abstract": "Choices for genome engineering and integration involve high efficiency with little or no target specificity or high specificity with low activity. Here, we describe a targeted integration strategy, called GeneWeld, and a vector series for gene tagging, pGTag (plasmids for Gene Tagging), which promote highly efficient and precise targeted integration in zebrafish embryos, pig fibroblasts, and human cells utilizing the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Our work demonstrates that in vivo targeting of a genomic locus of interest with CRISPR/Cas9 and a donor vector containing as little as 24 to 48 base pairs of homology directs precise and efficient knock-in when the homology arms are exposed with a double strand break in vivo. Our results suggest that the length of homology is not important in the design of knock-in vectors but rather how the homology is presented to a double strand break in the genome. Given our results targeting multiple loci in different species, we expect the accompanying protocols, vectors, and web interface for homology arm design to help streamline gene targeting and applications in CRISPR and TALEN compatible systems.",

    "abstract": "While deregulated intracellular signaling initiates melanoma, intercellular crosstalk within the tumor microenvironment, often coordinated by soluble factors, is essential for melanoma progression and metastasis. One such secreted matricellular protein, cellular communication network factor 4 (CCN4), stimulates metastasis in other malignancies. Here, we report that CCN4 expression is associated progressively with reduced overall survival in patients with primary melanomas. To reveal the roles of CCN4 in melanoma progression, we used mouse melanoma models and knocked out Ccn4 using a homology-directed repair CRISPR/CAS9 system to generate pools of Ccn4-knockout cells. In vitro assays supported previous findings using clones generated using a double nickase-based CRISPR/CAS9 system that CCN4 promoted an epithelial - mesenchymal-like transition in melanoma cells and stimulated invasion and metastasis. We also found that, while Ccn4 knockout enhanced cell growth in optimal 2D culture conditions, the knockout suppressed certain cell survival signaling pathways and rendered cells less resistant to stress conditions. Tumor cell growth assays at sub-optimal conditions in vitro, quantitative analysis of tumor growth assays in vivo, and transcriptomics analysis of human melanoma cell lines suggested that CCN4 repressed cell growth and simultaneously enhanced cell survival. The collective role of CCN4 suggests a potential therapeutic target for limiting metastatic invasion in melanoma and a biomarker for metastatic potential.",

    "abstract": "We learn about population history and underlying evolutionary biology through patterns of genetic polymorphism. Many approaches to reconstruct evolutionary histories focus on a limited number of informative statistics describing distributions of allele frequencies or patterns of linkage disequilibrium. We show that many commonly used statistics are part of a broad family of two-locus moments whose expectation can be computed jointly and rapidly under a wide range of scenarios, including complex multi-population demographies with continuous migration and admixture events. A full inspection of these statistics reveals that widely used models of human history fail to predict simple patterns of linkage disequilibrium. To jointly capture the information contained in classical and novel statistics, we implemented a tractable likelihood-based inference framework for demographic history. Using this approach, we show that human evolutionary models that include archaic admixture in Africa, Asia, and Europe provide a much better description of patterns of genetic diversity across the human genome. We estimate that an unidentified, deeply diverged population admixed with modern humans within Africa both before and after the split of African and Eurasian populations, contributing 4 - 8% genetic ancestry to individuals in world-wide populations.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThroughout human history, populations have expanded and contracted, split and merged, and ex-changed migrants. Because these events affected genetic diversity, we can learn about human history by comparing predictions from evolutionary models to genetic data. Here, we show how to rapidly compute such predictions for a wide range of diversity measures within and across populations under complex demographic scenarios. While widely used models of human history accurately predict common measures of diversity, we show that they strongly underestimate the co-occurence of low frequency mutations within human populations in Asia, Europe, and Africa. Models allowing for archaic admixture, the relatively recent mixing of human populations with deeply diverged human lineages, resolve this discrepancy. We use such models to infer demographic models that include both recent and ancient features of human history. We recover the well-characterized admixture of Neanderthals in Eurasian populations, as well as admixture from an as-yet unknown diverged human population within Africa, further suggesting that admixture with deeply diverged lineages occurred multiple times in human history. By simultaneously testing model predictions for a broad range of diversity statistics, we can assess the robustness of common evolutionary models, identify missing historical events, and build more informed models of human demography.",

    "abstract": "The increasing size and diversity of genome-wide association studies provide an exciting opportunity to study how the genetics of complex traits vary among diverse populations. Here, we introduce covariate-adjusted LD score regression (cov-LDSC), a method to accurately estimate genetic heritability [Formula] and its enrichment in both homogenous and admixed populations with summary statistics and in-sample LD estimates. In-sample LD can be estimated from a subset of the GWAS samples, allowing our method to be applied efficiently to very large cohorts. In simulations, we show that unadjusted LDSC underestimates [Formula] by 10% - 60% in admixed populations; in contrast, cov-LDSC is robust to all simulation parameters. We apply cov-LDSC to genotyping data from approximately 170,000 Latino, 47,000 African American and 135,000 European individuals. We estimate [Formula] and detect heritability enrichment in three quantitative and five dichotomous phenotypes respectively, making this, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive heritability-based analysis of admixed individuals. Our results show that most traits have high concordance of [Formula] and consistent tissue-specific heritability enrichment among different populations. However, for age at menarche, we observe population-specific heritability estimates of [Formula]. We observe consistent patterns of tissue-specific heritability enrichment across populations; for example, in the limbic system for BMI, the per-standardized-annotation effect size{tau} * is 0.16 {+/-} 0.04, 0.28 {+/-} 0.11 and 0.18 {+/-} 0.03 in Latino, African American and European populations respectively. Our results demonstrate that our approach is a powerful way to analyze genetic data for complex traits from underrepresented populations.\n\nAuthor summaryAdmixed populations such as African Americans and Hispanic Americans bear a disproportionately high burden of disease but remain underrepresented in current genetic studies. It is important to extend current methodological advancements for understanding the genetic basis of complex traits in homogeneous populations to individuals with admixed genetic backgrounds. Here, we develop a computationally efficient method to answer two specific questions. First, does genetic variation contribute to the same amount of phenotypic variation (heritability) across diverse populations? Second, are the genetic mechanisms shared among different populations? To answer these questions, we use our novel method to conduct the first comprehensive heritability-based analysis of a large number of admixed individuals. We show that there is a high degree of concordance in total heritability and tissue-specific enrichment between different ancestral groups. However, traits such as age at menarche show a noticeable differences among populations. Our work provides a powerful way to analyze genetic data in admixed populations and may contribute to the applicability of genomic medicine to admixed population groups.",

In the gracile nucleus of aged monkeys, only aging-related spheroidal bodies were observed and no megaloneurites occurred. The dense, abnormal NADPH-d positive megaloneurites, extremely different from regular NADPH-d positive fibers, were prominent in the sacral segments and occurred in extending from Lissauers tract (LT) through lamina I along the lateral boundary of the dorsal horn to the region of the SPN. Meanwhile, large diameter punctate NADPH-d activity occurred and scattered in the lateral white matter of the LCP and dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) at the same level of NADPH-d abnormality in the gray matters. Those dot-like NADPH-d alterations were examined by horizontal sectioning and indicated ascending or descending oriental fibers. These NADPH-d megaloneurites had the same composition as the punctate NADPH-d alterations and were co-localized with the VIP immunoreaction, while the ANBs did not coexist with the VIP immunoreaction. Both ANBs and megaloneurites provide consistent evidence that the anomalous neuritic alterations in the aged sacral spinal cord are referred to as a specialized aging marker in the pelvic visceral organs in non-human primates.",

    "abstract": "Activation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae HO promoter is highly regulated, requiring the ordered recruitment of activators and coactivators and allowing production of only a few transcripts in mother cells within a short cell cycle window. We conducted genetic screens to identify the negative regulators of HO expression necessary to limit HO transcription. Known repressors of HO (Ash1 and Rpd3) were identified, as well as several additional chromatin-associated factors including the Hda1 histone deacetylase, the Isw2 chromatin remodeler, and the corepressor Tup1. We also identified clusters of HO promoter mutations that suggested roles for the Dot6/Tod6 (PAC site) and Ume6 repression pathways. We used ChIP assays with synchronized cells to validate the involvement of these factors and map the association of Ash1, Dot6, and Ume6 with the HO promoter to a brief window in the cell cycle between binding of the initial activating transcription factor and initiation of transcription. We found that Ash1 and Ume6 each recruit the Rpd3 histone deacetylase to HO, and their effects are additive. In contrast, Rpd3 was not recruited significantly to the PAC site, suggesting this site has a distinct mechanism for repression. Increases in HO expression and SWI/SNF recruitment were all additive upon loss of Ash1, Ume6, and PAC site factors, indicating the convergence of independent pathways for repression. Our results demonstrate that multiple protein complexes are important for limiting the spread of SWI/SNF mediated nucleosome eviction across the HO promoter, suggesting that regulation requires a delicate balance of activities that promote and repress transcription.",

Rats were then trained and tested in a delayed-match-to-sample (DMS) task to establish baseline working memory performance over a five-day block of testing. Next, rats received daily systemic administration of the mGlu5 NAM MTEP (3 mg/kg), mGlu5 PAM CDPPB (30 mg/kg) or vehicle prior to DMS testing during a block of five days, followed by a 5-day washout DMS testing block.\\n\\nResultsMTEP and CDPPB decreased drug seeking in response to cocaine-associated cues after prolonged abstinence. However, repeated treatment with MTEP impaired working memory, while CDPPB had no effects on performance.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results emphasize the relevance of evaluating cognitive function within the context of investigating pharmacotherapies to treat CUD.

    "abstract": "Parental care has evolved repeatedly and independently across animals. While the ecological and evolutionary significance of parental behaviour is well recognized, underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We took advantage of behavioural diversity across closely related species of South American poison frogs (Family Dendrobatidae) to identify neural correlates of parental behaviour shared across sexes and species. We characterized differences in neural induction, gene expression in active neurons, and activity of specific neuronal types in three species with distinct parental care patterns: male uniparental, female uniparental, and biparental. We identified the medial pallium and preoptic area as core brain regions associated with parental care, independent of sex and species. Identification of neurons active during parental care confirms a role for neuropeptides associated with care in other vertebrates as well as identifying novel candidates. Our work is the first to explore neural and molecular mechanisms of parental care in amphibians and highlights the potential for mechanistic studies in closely related but behaviourally variable species to build a more complete understanding of how shared principles and species-specific diversity govern parental care and other social behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the drivers of morphological diversity is a persistent challenge in evolutionary biology. Here, we investigate functional diversification of secretory cells in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis to understand the mechanisms promoting cellular specialization across animals. We demonstrate regionalized expression of gland cell subtypes in the internal ectoderm of N. vectensis and show that adult gland cell identity is acquired very early in development. A phylogenetic survey of trypsins across animals suggests this gene family has undergone numerous expansions. We reveal unexpected diversity in trypsin protein structure and show that trypsin diversity arose through independent acquisitions of non-trypsin domains. Finally, we show that trypsin diversification in N. vectensis was effected through a combination of tandem duplication, exon shuffling, and retrotransposition. Together we reveal that numerous evolutionary mechanisms drove trypsin duplication and divergence during the morphological specialization of cell types and suggest the secretory cell phenotype is highly adaptable as a vehicle for novel secretory products.",

    "abstract": "Overgeneralized fear has long been implicated in generalized anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, however, time-dependent mechanisms underlying memory retrieval are still not completely understood. Previous studies have revealed that stronger fear conditioning training protocols are associated with both increased post-training corticosterone (CORT) levels and fear responses at later retrieval tests. Here we used discriminative contextual fear conditioning (CFC) to investigate the relationship between post-training CORT levels and memory specificity in different retrieval timepoints. Wistar rats were exposed to CFC training with increasing footshock intensities (0.3, 0.6 or 1.0mA) and had their blood collected 30 min afterwards to measure post-training plasma CORT. After 2, 14 or 28 days, rats were tested for memory specificity either in the training or in the novel context. Regression analysis was used to verify linear and non-linear interactions between CORT levels and freezing. Higher footshock intensities increased post-training CORT levels and freezing times during tests in all timepoints. Moreover, stronger trainings elicited faster memory generalization, which was associated with higher CORT levels during memory consolidation. The 0.3mA training maintained memory specificity up to 28 days. Additionally, linear regressions suggest that the shift from specific to generalized memories is underway at 14 days after training. These results are consistent with the hypotheses that stronger training protocols elicit a faster generalization rate, and that this process is associated with increased post-training CORT release.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSStronger contextual fear conditioning (CFC) elicits higher plasma corticosterone (CORT).\\n\\nStrong CFC and high CORT levels increase the rate of memory generalization.\\n\\nWeak CFC and low CORT levels retain memory specificity up to 28 days.\\n\\nPost-training plasma CORT is linearly associated with remote generalized fear.",

However, the functional impact of different VNS parameters on postprandial gastric motility remains incompletely characterized. Moreover, while most studies focused on stimulating the motor limb (i.e. efferent VNS) of the vagovagal circuitry, the contribution of electrically activating the reflex arc of the circuitry (i.e. afferent VNS) to downstream control of gastric function has seldom been investigated.\\n\\nMethodsHere, we used dynamic gastric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess antropyloric motility in anesthetized rats during which VNS was applied to the left cervical vagus. The configuration of VNS was varied in terms of directionality (i.e. afferent, efferent or combined afferent and efferent VNS) as well as parameter settings (i.e. pulse amplitude, pulse width, and frequency). The motility measurements were computed using a previously developed computer-assisted image processing pipeline.\\n\\nKey ResultsWe found that electrical activation that favored the afferent pathway could promote gastric motility and coordination more effectively than direct activation of the efferent pathway.

    "abstract": "Pattern separation is a fundamental brain computation that converts small differences in synaptic input patterns into large differences in action potential (AP) output patterns. Pattern separation plays a key role in the dentate gyrus, enabling the efficient storage and recall of memories in downstream hippocampal CA3 networks. Several mechanisms for pattern separation have been proposed, including expansion of coding space, sparsification of neuronal activity, and simple thresholding mechanisms. Alternatively, a winner-takes-all mechanism, in which the most excited cells inhibit all less-excited cells by lateral inhibition, might be involved. Although such a mechanism is computationally powerful, it remains unclear whether it operates in biological networks. Here, we develop a full-scale network model of the dentate gyrus, comprised of granule cells (GCs) and parvalbumin+ (PV+) inhibitory interneurons, based on experimentally determined biophysical cellular properties and synaptic connectivity rules. Our results demonstrate that a biologically realistic principal neuron-interneuron (PN-IN) network model is a highly efficient pattern separator. Mechanistic dissection in the model revealed that a winner-takes-all mechanism by lateral inhibition plays a crucial role in pattern separation. Furthermore, both fast signaling properties of PV+ interneurons and focal GC-interneuron connectivity are essential for efficient pattern separation. Thus, PV+ interneurons are not only involved in basic microcircuit functions, but also contribute to higher-order computations in neuronal networks, such as pattern separation.",

In order to examine the relationship of these neural signals to the resulting behavior, it is critical to demix the recordings into meaningful spatial and temporal components that can be mapped onto well-defined brain regions. However, no current tools satisfactorily extract the activity of the different brain regions in individual mice in a data-driven manner, while taking into account mouse-specific and preparation-specific differences. Here, we introduce Localized semi-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (LocaNMF), a method that efficiently decomposes widefield video data and allows us to directly compare activity across multiple mice by outputting mouse-specific localized functional regions that are significantly more interpretable than more traditional decomposition techniques. Moreover, it provides a natural subspace to directly compare correlation maps and neural dynamics across different behaviors, mice, and experimental conditions, and enables identification of task- and movement-related brain regions.",

    "abstract": "Although quantitative trait locus (QTL) associations have been identified for many molecular traits such as gene expression, it remains challenging to distinguish the causal nucleotide from nearby variants. In addition to traditional QTLs by association, allele-specific (AS) QTLs are a powerful measure of cis-regulation that are largely concordant with traditional QTLs, and can be less susceptible to technical/environmental noise. However, existing asQTL analysis methods do not produce probabilities of causality for each marker, and do not take into account correlations among markers at a locus in linkage disequilibrium (LD). We introduce PLASMA (PopuLation Allele-Specific MApping), a novel, LD-aware method that integrates QTL and asQTL information to fine-map causal regulatory variants while drawing power from both the number of individuals and the number of allelic reads per individual. We demonstrate through simulations that PLASMA successfully detects causal variants over a wide range of genetic architectures. We apply PLASMA to RNA-Seq data from 524 kidney tumor samples and show that over 17 percent of loci can be fine-mapped to within 5 causal variants, compared less than 2 percent of loci using existing QTL-based fine-mapping. PLASMA furthermore achieves a greater power at 50 samples than conventional QTL fine-mapping does at over 500 samples. Overall, PLASMA achieves a 6.9-fold reduction in median 95% credible set size compared to existing QTL-based fine-mapping. We additionally apply PLASMA to H3K27AC ChIP-Seq from 28 prostate tumor/normal samples and demonstrate that PLASMA is able to prioritize markers even at small samples, with PLASMA achieving a 1.3-fold reduction in median 95% credible set sizes over existing QTL-based fine-mapping. Variants in the PLASMA credible sets for RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq were enriched for open chromatin and chromatin looping (respectively) at a comparable or greater degree than credible variants from existing methods, while containing far fewer markers. Our results demonstrate how integrating AS activity can substantially improve the detection of causal variants from existing molecular data and at low sample size.",

In bacteria, details on nucleoid organization regulatory mechanisms and function remains poorly characterized, especially in non-model species. Here, we investigate the role of DNA partitioning protein ParB and condensin complexes, two key players in bacterial chromosome structuring, in the actinobacterium Corynebacterium glutamicum. Chromosome conformation capture reveals SMC-mediated long-range interactions around ten centromere-like parS sites clustered at the replication origin (oriC). At least one oriC-proximal parS site is necessary for a reliable chromosome segregation. Using a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation and photoactivated single molecule localization microscopy evidences the formation of distinct ParB-nucleoprotein subclusters in dependence of parS numbers. We further identified and functionally characterized two condensin paralogs. Whereas SMC/ScpAB complexes are loaded via ParB at parS sites mediating chromosomal inter-arm contacts like in Bacillus subtilis, the MukBEF-like SMC complex MksBEFG does not contribute to chromosomal DNA-folding. Rather, the MksBEFG complex is involved in plasmid maintenance and interacts with the polar oriC-tethering factor DivIVA. These data complement current models of ParB-SMC/ScpAB crosstalk, while showing that some condensin complexes evolved functions uncoupled from chromosome folding.",

Bats are emerging as a model system with great potential to shed light on these processes given their learned vocalisations, close social interactions, and mammalian brains and physiology. A recent framework outlined the multiple levels of investigation needed to understand vocal learning across a broad range of non-human species including cetaceans, pinnipeds, elephants, birds and bats. Herein we apply this framework to the current state of the art in bat research. This encompasses our understanding of the abilities bats have displayed for vocal learning, what is known about the timing and social structure needed for such learning, and current knowledge about the prevalence of the trait across the order. It also addresses the biology (vocal tract morphology, neurobiology, and genetics) and phylogenetics of this trait. We conclude by highlighting some key questions that should be answered to advance our understanding of the biological encoding and evolution of speech and spoken communication.",

    "abstract": "In the dentate gyrus of the rodent hippocampus, neurogenesis begins prenatally and continues to the end of life. Adult-born neurons often die in the first few weeks after mitosis, but then survive indefinitely. In contrast, neurons born at the peak of development are initially stable but can die later in adulthood. Physiological and pathological changes in hippocampal structure may therefore result from both the addition of new neurons and the loss of older neurons. However, it is unknown whether neurons born at other stages of development also undergo delayed cell death. Here, we used BrdU to label dentate granule cells that were born in rats on embryonic day 19 (E19; before the developmental peak), postnatal day 6 (P6; peak) and P21 (after the peak). We quantified BrdU+ neurons in separate groups of rats at 2 and 6 months post-BrdU injection. Consistent with previous work, there was a 15% loss of P6-born neurons between 2 and 6 months of age. In contrast, E19- or P21-born neurons were stable throughout young adulthood. Delayed death of P6-born neurons suggests they may play a unique role in hippocampal plasticity and pathology in adulthood.",

Understanding the mechanisms of their pleiotropic signaling activity requires to directly manipulate their activity of decision leading to distinct cellular responses. We developed an optogenetic probe, optoSRC, to control spatio-temporally the SRC kinase, a representative example of versatile signaling node, and challenge its ability to generate different cellular responses. Genesis of different local molecular fluxes of the same optoSRC to adhesion sites, was sufficient to trigger distinct and specific acto-adhesive responses. Collectively, this study reveals how hijacking the pleiotropy of SRC signaling by modulating in space and time subcellular molecular fluxes of active SRC kinases.",

    "abstract": "Sialic acids (Sia) are widely displayed on the surfaces of cells and tissues. Sia come in a variety of chemically modified forms, including those with acetyl modifications at the C7, C8, and C9 positions. Here, we analyzed the distribution and amounts of these acetyl modifications in different human and canine cells. As Sia or their variant forms are receptors for influenza A and influenza C viruses, we examined the effects of these modifications on virus infections. We confirmed that 9-O-acetyl and 7,9-O-acetyl modified Sia are widely but variably expressed across cell lines from both humans and canines. While they were expressed on the cell surface of canine MDCK cell lines, they were located primarily within the Golgi compartment of human HEK-293 and A549 cells. The O-acetyl modified Sia were expressed at low levels of 1-2% of total Sia in these cell lines. We knocked out and over-expressed the sialate O-acetyltransferase gene (CasD1), and knocked out the sialate O-acetylesterase gene (SIAE) using CRISPR/Cas9 editing. Knocking out CasD1 removed 7,9-O- and 9-O-acetyl Sia expression, confirming previous reports. However, over-expression of CasD1 and knockout of SIAE gave only modest increases in 9-O-acetyl levels in cells and no change in 7,9-O-acetyl levels, indicating that there are complex regulations of these modifications. These modifications were essential for influenza C infection, but had no obvious effect on influenza A infection.\\n\\nIMPORTANCESialic acids are key glycans that are involved in many different normal cellular functions, as well as being receptors for many pathogens. However, Sia come in diverse chemically modified forms. Here we examined and manipulated the expression of 7,9-O- and 9-O-acetyl modified Sia on cells commonly used in influenza virus and other research by engineering the enzymes that produce or remove the acetyl groups.",

    "abstract": "Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR associated (Cas) effector proteins enable the targeting of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) to defined loci based on a variable length RNA guide specific to each effector. The guide RNAs are generally similar in size and form, consisting of a ~20 nucleotide sequence complementary to the DNA target and an RNA secondary structure recognized by the effector. However, the effector proteins vary in Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) requirements, nuclease activities, and DNA binding kinetics. Recently, ErCas12a, a new member of the Cas12a family, was identified in Eubacterium rectale. Here, we report the first characterization of ErCas12a activity in zebrafish and human cells. Using a fluorescent reporter system, we show that CRISPR/ErCas12a elicits strand annealing mediated DNA repair more efficiently than CRISPR/Cas9. Further, using our previously reported gene targeting method that utilizes short homology, GeneWeld, we demonstrate the use of CRISPR/ErCas12a to integrate reporter alleles into the genomes of both zebrafish and human cells. Together, this work provides methods for deploying an additional CRISPR/Cas system, thus increasing the flexibility researchers have in applying genome engineering technologies.",

    "abstract": "Identification of proteins that are synthesized de novo in response to specific microenvironmental cues is critical to understanding the molecular mechanisms that underpin key physiological processes and pathologies. Here we report that a brief period of pulsed SILAC diet (Stable Isotope Labelling by Amino acids in Cell culture) enables determination of biological functions corresponding to actively translating proteins in the mouse brain. Our data demonstrate that the hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum are highly active sites of protein synthesis, rapidly expressing key mediators of nutrient sensing and lipid metabolism, as well as critical regulators of synaptic function, axon guidance, and circadian entrainment. Together, these findings confirm that protein metabolic activity varies significantly between brain regions in vivo and indicate that pSILAC-based approaches can identify specific anatomical sites and biological pathways likely to be suitable for drug targeting in neurodegenerative disorders.\\n\\nAbbreviationsApoA1: Apolipoprotein A1, ApoA4: Apolipoprotein A4, ApoE: Apolipoprotein E, ApoJ/Clu: Apolipoprotein J/Clusterin, App: Amyloid-{beta} precursor/A4 protein: App, HDL: high density lipoprotein, Lrp1: Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1, pSILAC: pulsed SILAC, pSIVOM: pulsed-SILAC in vivo labelling in mouse, SILAC: Stable Isotope Labelling by Amino acids in Cell culture)",
