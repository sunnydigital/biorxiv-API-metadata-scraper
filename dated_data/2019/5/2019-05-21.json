    "abstract": "BackgroundTriatomine kissing bugs are responsible for the vectorial transmission of the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, etiological agent of Chagas disease, a zoonosis affecting 10 million people and with 25 million at risk of infection. Triatomines are associated with particular habitats that offer shelter and food. Several triatomine species of the Rhodnius genus have close association with palm crowns, where bugs can obtain blood from the associated fauna. The Rhodnius - palm interaction has been reported in several places of Central and South America. However, the association in the distributions of Rhodnius species and palms has not been quantitatively determined.\\n\\nMethodology/Principal FindingsBroad distributions of eight Rhodnius species and 16 palm species with Rhodnius-infestation reports were estimated using Ecological Niche Models. Rhodnius species distributions in their total range were compared to their distributions in areas with palms. Rhodnius species presence was found to be higher in areas with palms. However, that tendency notoriously depended on palm species. Rhodnius species presence increased several times in areas with particular palm species. Moreover, a possible relationship was found between Rhodnius and palm species richness, indicating the Amazon region as the convergent region where several Rhodnius and palm species intersected. Finally, palm distribution was evaluated as predictor of Rhodnius species distributions, but their inclusion in the distributions models did not improve their performance.\\n\\nConclusions/SignificanceThe distributions of some Rhodnius and palm species showed a high spatial association, which can be based on species interaction or niche similarity. Based on distribution convergence, the Amazon region appear to be the origin of the Rhodnius-palm association. The direct relationship between palms and Rhodnius species richness could be based on the habitat heterogeneity offered by different palm species. Despite spatial association, palm presence would not be a relevant predictor of Rhodnius species distributions in comparison to other environmental variables. Inclusion of other input data as hosts distribution could help to increase model predictability.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe infestation of palms with Rhodnius genus kissing bugs (Chagas disease vectors) is important from the public health perspective, since insects living in palms can infest nearby houses. The migration of these bugs to households could threaten vector control programs since reinfestation of treated dwellings can occur. Association between Rhodnius and palms species distributions has been previously suggested but never quantitatively determined. The strong association between one palm species and one Rhodnius species can be used as a factor to predict the presence of Rhodnius bugs in definite areas. In this study, we estimated by models the distributions of eight Rhodnius species and 18 Rhodnius-infested palm species. Rhodnius distributions models showed a biased presence toward areas with certain palm species. That specific association was very strong in some cases; however, the presence of associated palm species was used in Rhodnius distributions models, but that did not improve the predictability of the models. Palm presence appear to be not essential for the Rhodnius current distribution because they could inhabit other habitats; but that association could be relevant to the Rhodnius evolutionary and biogeographic history.",

    "abstract": "Melanins are synthesized macromolecules that are found in all biological kingdoms. These pigments have a myriad of roles that range from microbial virulence to key components of the innate immune response in invertebrates. Melanins also exhibit unique properties with potential applications in physics and material sciences, ranging from electrical batteries to novel therapeutics. In the fungi, melanins such as eumelanins, are components of the cell wall that provide protection against biotic and abiotic elements. Elucidation of the smallest fungal cell wall-asociated melanin unit that serves as a building block is critical to understand the architecture of these polymers, its interaction with surrounding components, and their functional versatility. In this study, we used isopycnic gradient sedimentation, NMR, EPR, high-resolution microscopy, and proteomics to analyze the melanin in the cell wall of the human pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans. We observed that melanin is assembled into the cryptococcal cell wall in spherical structures of [~]200 nm in diameter, termed melanin granules, which are in turn composed of nanospheres of [~]30 nm in diameter, the fungal melanosomes. We noted that melanin granules are closely associated with proteins that may play critical roles in the fungal melanogenesis and the supramolecular structure of this polymer. Using this structural information, we propose a model for C. neoformans melanization that is similar to the process used in animal melanization and is consistent with the phylogenetic relatedness of the fungal and animal kingdoms.",

It is therefore important to investigate the processes of hippocampal self-regulation, to monitor therapeutic efficacy of preclinical interventions. We have developed a closed-loop, virtual reality neurofeedback paradigm for real-time fMRI, that provides a standardized method for quantifying processes of hippocampal self-regulation. We acquired multi-modal neuroimaging data from a sample of 53 cognitively unimpaired subjects at risk for AD and applied standard methods of structural and functional connectomics. The analyses reveal significant negative associations between hippocampal CA1 down-regulation performance and APOE-{varepsilon}4 alleles, as well as hippocampal streamline density volume. Better memory performance was associated with increased, bilateral hippocampal functional connectivity during the neurofeedback task. These are the first results to link neurofeedback performance to a genetic risk factor and structural connectivity. Further, these are the first evidence that functional cohesion between the hippocampi can reflect subtle differences in memory function, in cognitively unimpaired individuals at risk for AD. We provide a novel method to assess hippocampal function in preclinical AD, and propose it can be used to derive proxies for neural reserve.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIAPOE-{varepsilon}4 alleles impact hippocampal down-regulation neurofeedback performance.\\nC_LIO_LIHippocampal streamline density volume is associated with decreased hippocampal down-regulation performance.\\nC_LIO_LIBilaterally cohesive hippocampal activity is associated with better memory performance.\\nC_LIO_LIWe provide a novel paradigm to investigate self-regulation and brain function.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "BackgroundVentricle retraining has been extensively studied by our laboratory. Previous studies have demonstrated that intermittent overload causes a more efficient ventricular hypertrophy. The adaptive mechanisms involved in the ventricle retraining are not completely established. This study assessed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in the ventricles of goats submitted to systolic overload.\\n\\nMethodsTwenty-one young goats were divided into 3 groups (7 animals each): control, 96-hour continuous systolic overload, and intermittent systolic overload (four 12-hour periods of systolic overload paired with 12-hour resting period). During the 96-hour protocol, systolic overload was adjusted to achieve a right ventricular (RV) / aortic pressure ratio of 0.7. Hemodynamic evaluations were performed daily before and after systolic overload. Echocardiograms were obtained preoperatively and at protocol end to measure cardiac masses thickness. At study end, the animals were killed for morphologic evaluation and immunohistochemical assessment of VEGF expression.\\n\\nResultsRV-trained groups developed hypertrophy of RV and septal masses, confirmed by increased weight and thickness, as expected. In the study groups, there was a small but significantly increased water content of the RV and septum compared with those in the control group (p<0.002). VEGF expression in the RV myocardium was greater in the intermittent group (2.89% {+/-} 0.41%) than in the continuous (1.80% {+/-} 0.19%) and control (1.43% {+/-} 0.18%) groups (p<0.023).\\n\\nConclusionsIntermittent systolic overload promotes greater upregulation of VEGF expression in the subpulmonary ventricle, an adaptation that provides a mechanism for increased myocardial perfusion during the rapid myocardial hypertrophy of young goats.",

    "abstract": "Human ether-a-go-go-related gene (Kv11.1, or hERG) is a potassium channel that conducts the delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr) during the repolarization phase of cardiac action potentials. hERG channels have a larger pore than other K+channels and can trap many unintended drugs, often resulting in acquired LQTS (aLQTS). R-roscovitine, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor that also inhibits L-type calcium channels, inhibits open hERG channels but does not become trapped in the pore. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings from Xenopus oocytes expressing wild-type (WT) or mutant (T623A, S624A, Y652A, F656A) hERG channels demonstrated that, compared to WT hERG, T623A, Y652A, and F656A inhibition by 200 M R-roscovitine was ~ 48 %, 29 %, and 73 % weaker, respectively. In contrast, S624A hERG was inhibited more potently than WT hERG, with an ~ 34 % stronger inhibition. These findings were further supported by the IC50 values, which were increased for T623A, Y652A and F656A (by ~5.5, 2.75, and 42 fold respectively) and reduced 1.3 fold for the S624A mutant. Our data suggest that while T623, Y652, and F656 are critical for R-roscovitine-mediated inhibition, S624 may not be. This relatively unique feature, coupled with R-roscovitines tolerance in clinical trials, could guide future drug screens. We discuss our findings and how they lend support for the recent Comprehensive In Vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA) guidelines on the re-evaluation of potentially useful drugs that had failed testing due to unintended interactions with hERG.",

However, their sub-mitochondrial localization and relationship with other critical mitochondrial complexes remains poorly understood. Here, using super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, we report that Miro proteins form nanometer-sized clusters along the mitochondrial outer membrane in association with the Mitochondrial Contact Site and Cristae Organizing System (MICOS). Using knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) we show that Miro1 and Miro2 are required for normal mitochondrial cristae architecture and endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contacts sites (ERMCS). Further, we show that Miro couples MICOS to TRAK motor protein adaptors to ensure the concerted transport of the two mitochondrial membranes and the correct distribution of cristae on the mitochondrial membrane. The Miro nanoscale organization, association with MICOS complex and regulation of ERMCS reveal new levels of control of the Miro GTPases on mitochondrial functionality.",

    "abstract": "During autumn in the temperate zone, insectivorous male bats face a profound energetic challenge, as in the same period they have to make energy choices related to hibernation, mating and migration. We found evidence by looking at biometric measurements that male pond bats (Myotis dasycneme) are pre-occupied with mating and lose weight, while simultaneously females are accumulating fat. Our purpose was to characterize the known hibernacula in terms of male or female bias, and subsequently compare their population trend during two study periods, between 1930-1980 and 1980-2015. Our findings include evidence of colonisation of winter roosts in formerly unoccupied areas and consequently a change in the migration patterns of the male population of this species. As male bats do not assist to raise their offspring, males have abundant time to restore their energy balance after hibernation. Our results suggest that choosing a hibernacula closer to the summer habitat not only decreases energy cost needed for migration, it also lengthens the mating season and presumably also has the additional advantage of increased paternity. Additionally, these findings have important conservation implications, as male and female biased hibernation assemblages may differ critically in terms of microclimate preferences.",

Plants under stress conditions undergo gene expression changes in specific genes or post-transcriptional gene regulators as miRNAs that can led to resistance. In this study, we investigated the miRNAs involved in the sugarcane response to aluminum stress. Four miRNA libraries were generated using sugarcane roots of two contrasting (tolerant and sensitive) sugarcane cultivars growing under aluminum stress to identify the miRNAs involved in the sugarcane response. Here we present the first miRNAs sequencing of sugarcane response under aluminum stress. The contrast of the cultivars seen in the field was reflected in the micro transcriptome with opposing expression profile. We selected 394 differentially expressed miRNAs, in both cultivars, 22% were common between cultivars. Real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to validate the differentially expressed miRNAs through high-throughput sequencing in sugarcane roots. Target genes prediction was also analyzed. Our results indicated miRNAs that modulated specific target genes involved in roots development and plant aluminum stress response. Those genes can be the answer to tolerance in sugarcane and used in breeding programs to develop tolerant cultivars.",

There is recent interest in a family of alarmins, including TSLP, IL-25 and IL-33, that are epithelial-derived and released upon stimulation of epithelial cells. Several genome wide association studies have found SNPs in genes encoding IL-33 to be risk factors for asthma. In two studies examining the direct role of IL-33 in eosinophils, there were differences in eosinophil responses. We sought to further characterize activation of eosinophils with IL-33 compared to activation by other cytokines and chemokines. We assessed IL-33 stimulated adhesion, degranulation, chemotaxis and cell surface protein expression in comparison to IL-3, IL-5, and eotaxin-1 on human eosinophils. Our results demonstrate that IL-33 can produce as potent or more eosinophil activation than IL-3, IL-5 and eotaxin-1.

    "abstract": "The emergence of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized the way of reaching a genome sequence, with the promise of potentially providing a comprehensive characterization of DNA variations. Nevertheless, detecting somatic mutations is still a difficult problem, in particular when trying to identify low abundance mutations such as subclonal mutations, tumour-derived alterations in body fluids or somatic mutations from histological normal tissue. The main challenge is to precisely distinguish between sequencing artefacts and true mutations, particularly when the latter are so rare they reach similar abundance levels as artefacts. Here, we present needlestack, a highly sensitive variant caller, which directly learns from the data the level of systematic sequencing errors to accurately call mutations. Needlestack is based on the idea that the sequencing error rate can be dynamically estimated from analyzing multiple samples together. We show that the sequencing error rate varies across alterations, illustrating the need to precisely estimate it. We evaluate the performance of needlestack for various types of variations, and we show that needlestack is robust among positions and outperforms existing state-of-the-art method for low abundance mutations.

    "abstract": "Biodiversity loss and sparse observational data mean that critical conservation decisions may be based on little to no information. Emerging technologies, such as airborne thermal imaging and virtual reality, may facilitate species monitoring and improve predictions of species distribution. Here we combined these two technologies to predict the distribution of koalas, specialized arboreal foliovores facing population declines in many parts of eastern Australia. For a study area in southeast Australia, we complemented ground-survey records with presence and absence observations from thermal-imagery obtained using Remotely-Piloted Aircraft Systems. These field observations were further complemented with information elicited from koala experts, who were immersed in 360-degree images of the study area. The experts were asked to state the probability of observing a koala at sites they viewed and to assign each probability a confidence rating. We fit logistic regression models to the ground survey data and the ground plus thermal-imagery survey data and a beta regression model to the expert elicitation data. We then combined parameter estimates from the expert-elicitation model with those from each of the survey models to predict koala presence and absence in the study area. The model that combined the ground, thermal-imagery and expert-elicitation data substantially reduced the uncertainty around parameter estimates and increased the accuracy of classifications (koala presence vs absence), relative to the model based on ground-survey data alone. Our findings suggest that data elicited from experts using virtual reality technology can be combined with data from other emerging technologies, such as airborne thermal-imagery, using traditional statistical models, to increase the information available for species distribution modelling and the conservation of vulnerable and protected species.",

    "abstract": "The 2014 - 2015 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5NX outbreak represents the largest and most expensive HPAI outbreak in the United States to date. Despite extensive traditional and molecular epidemiological studies, factors associated with the spread of HPAI among midwestern poultry premises remain unclear. To better understand the dynamics of this outbreak, 182 full genome HPAI H5N2 sequences isolated from commercial layer chicken and turkey production premises were analyzed using evolutionary models modified to incorporate epidemiological and geographic information. Epidemiological compartmental models constructed in a phylogenetic framework provided evidence that poultry type acted as a barrier to the transmission of virus among midwestern poultry farms. Furthermore, after initial introduction, a continuous external source of virus was not needed to explain the propagation of HPAI cases within the commercial poultry industries. Discrete trait diffusion models indicated that within state viral transitions occurred more frequently than inter-state transitions. Distance, road density and proportion of water coverage were all supported as associated with viral transition between county groups (Bayes Factor > 3.0). Together these findings indicate that the midwestern poultry industries were not a single homogenous population, but rather, the outbreak was shaped by poultry sectors and geographic factors.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak among poultry farms in the midwestern United States appears to be influenced by agricultural and geographic factors. After initial introduction of the virus into the poultry industries, no further introductions (such as from a wild bird reservoir) were necessary to explain the continuation of the outbreak from March to June 2015. Additionally, evidence suggests that proximity increases the chances of viral movement between two locations. While many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the transmission of virus among poultry farms, the support for road density as an important driver of viral movement suggests human-mediated viral transportation played a key role in the spread of the highly pathogenic H5N2 outbreak in North America.",

    "abstract": "In complex real-life motor skills such as unconstrained throwing, performance depends on how accurate is on average the outcome of noisy, high-dimensional, and redundant actions. What characteristics of the action distribution relate to performance and how different individuals select specific action distributions are key questions in motor control. Previous computational approaches have highlighted that variability along the directions of first order derivatives of the action-to-outcome mapping affects performance the most, that different mean actions may be associated to regions of the actions space with different sensitivity to noise, and that action covariation in addition to noise magnitude matters. However, a method to relate individual high-dimensional action distribution and performance is still missing. Here we introduce a de-composition of performance into a small set of indicators that compactly and directly characterize the key performance-related features of the distribution of high-dimensional redundant actions. Central to the method is the observation that, if performance is quantified as a mean score, the Hessian (second order derivatives) of the action-to-score function determines how the noise of the action distribution affects the average score. We can then approximate the mean score as the sum of the score of the mean action and a tolerance-variability index which depends on both Hessian and action covariance. Such index can be expressed as the product of three terms capturing noise magnitude, noise sensitivity, and alignment of the most variable and most noise sensitive directions. We apply this method to the analysis of unconstrained throwing actions by non-expert participants and show that, consistently across four different throwing targets, each participant shows a specific selection of mean action score and tolerance-variability index as well as specific selection of noise magnitude and alignment indicators. Thus, participants with different strategies may display the same performance because they can trade off suboptimal mean action for better tolerance-variability and higher action variability for better alignment with more tolerant directions in action space.\n\nAuthor summaryWhy do people differ in their performance of complex motor skills? In many real-life motor tasks achieving a goal requires selecting an appropriate high-dimensional action out of infinitely many goal-equivalent actions. Because of sensorimotor noise, we are unable to execute the exact same movement twice and our performance depends on how accurate we are on average. Thus, to understand why people perform differently we need to characterize how their action distribution relates to their mean task score. While better performance is often associated to smaller variability around a more accurate mean action, performance also depends on the relationship between the directions of highest variability in action space and the directions in which action variability affects the most the outcome of the action. However, characterizing such geometric relationship when actions are high dimensional is challenging. In this work we introduce a method that allows to characterize the key performance-related features of the distribution of high-dimensional actions by a small set of indicators. We can then compare such indicators in different people performing a complex task (such as unconstrained throwing) and directly characterize the most skilled ones but also identify different strategies that distinguish people with similar performance.",

    "abstract": "Nucleotide excision repair (NER) protects the genome following exposure to diverse types of DNA damage, including UV light and chemotherapeutics. Mutations in mammalian NER genes lead to diseases such as xeroderma pigmentosum, trichothiodystrophy, and Cockayne syndrome. In eukaryotes, the major transcription factor TFIIH is the central hub of NER. The core components of TFIIH include the helicases XPB, XPD, and five  structural subunits. Two of these structural TFIIH proteins, p44 and p62 remain relatively unstudied; p44 is known to regulate the helicase activity of XPD during NER whereas p62s role is thought to be structural. However, a recent cryo-EM structure shows that p44, p62, and XPD make extensive contacts within TFIIH, with part of p62 occupying XPDs DNA binding site. This observation implies a more extensive role in DNA repair beyond the structural integrity of TFIIH. Here, we show that p44 stimulates XPDs ATPase but upon encountering DNA damage, further stimulation is only observed when p62 is part of the ternary complex; suggesting a role for the p44/p62 heterodimer in TFIIHs mechanism of damage detection. Using single molecule imaging, we demonstrate that p44/p62 independently interacts with DNA; it is seen to diffuse, however, in the presence of UV-induced DNA lesions the complex stalls. Combined with the analysis of a recent cryo-EM structure we suggest that p44/p62 acts as a novel DNA-binding entity within TFIIH that is capable of recognizing DNA damage. This revises our understanding of TFIIH and prompts more extensive investigation into the core subunits for an active role during both DNA repair and transcription.",

Loss of Yap in T cells results in enhanced T cell activation, differentiation and function, which translates in vivo to an improved ability for T cells to infiltrate and repress tumors. Gene expression analyses of tumor-infiltrating T cells following Yap deletion implicates Yap as a mediator of global T cell responses in the tumor microenvironment and as a key negative regulator of T cell tumor infiltration and patient survival in diverse human cancers.

    "abstract": "Appendage patterning and evolution have been active areas of inquiry for the past two centuries. While most work has centered on the skeleton, particularly that of amniotes, the evolutionary origins and molecular underpinnings of the neuromuscular diversity of fish appendages have remained enigmatic. The fundamental pattern of segmentation in amniotes, for example, is that all muscle precursors and spinal nerves enter either the paired appendages or body wall at the same spinal level. The condition in finned vertebrates is not understood. To address this gap in knowledge, we investigated the development of muscles and nerves in unpaired and paired fins of skates and compared them to those of chain catsharks. During skate and shark embryogenesis, cell populations of muscle precursors and associated spinal nerves at the same axial level contribute to both appendages and body wall, perhaps representing an ancestral condition of gnathostome appendicular neuromuscular systems. Remarkably in skates, this neuromuscular bifurcation as well as colinear Hox expression extend posteriorly to pattern a broad paired fin domain. In addition, we identified migratory muscle precursors (MMPs), which are known to develop into paired appendage muscles with Pax3 and Lbx1 gene expression, in the dorsal fins of skates. Our results suggest that muscles of paired fins have evolved via redeployment of the genetic program of MMPs that were already involved in dorsal fin development. Appendicular neuromuscular systems most likely have emerged as side branches of body wall neuromusculature and have been modified to adapt to distinct aquatic and terrestrial habitats.",

However, mining human transcriptome data for disease biomarkers in clinical specimens is restricted by the limited power of conventional reference-based protocols relying on uniquely mapped reads and transcript annotations. Here, we implemented a blind reference-free computational protocol, DE-kupl, to directly infer RNA variations of any origin, including yet unreferenced RNAs, from high coverage total stranded RNA-sequencing datasets of tissue origin. As a bench test, this protocol was powered for detection of RNA subsequences embedded into unannotated putative long noncoding (lnc)RNAs expressed in prostate cancer tissues. Through filtering and visual inspection of 1,179 candidates, we defined 21 lncRNA probes that were further validated for robust tumor-specific expression by NanoString single molecule-based RNA measurements in 144 tissue specimens. Predictive modeling yielded a restricted probe panel enabling over 90% of true positive detection of cancer in an independent dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Remarkably, this clinical signature made of only 9 unannotated lncRNAs largely outperformed PCA3, the only RNA biomarker approved by the Food and Drug Administration agency, specifically, in detection of high-risk prostate tumors.

    "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular parasite that persistently infects the CNS and that has genetically distinct strains which provoke different acute immune responses. How differences in the acute immune response affect the CNS immune response is unknown. To address this question, we used two persistent Toxoplasma strains (type II and type III) and examined the CNS immune response at 21 days post infection (dpi). Contrary to acute infection studies, type III-infected mice had higher numbers of total CNS T cells and macrophages/microglia but fewer alternatively activated macrophages (M2s) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) than type II-infected mice. By profiling splenocytes at 5, 10 and 21 dpi, we determined that at 5 dpi type III-infected mice had more M2s while type II-infected mice had more classically activated macrophages (M1s) and these responses flipped over time. To test how these early differences influence the CNS immune response, we engineered the type III strain to lack ROP16 (III{Delta}rop16), the polymorphic effector protein that drives the type III-associated M2 response. III{Delta}rop16-infected mice showed a type II-like neuroinflammatory response with fewer infiltrating T cells and macrophages/microglia and more M2s and an unexpectedly low CNS parasite burden. At 5 dpi, III{Delta}rop16-infected mice showed a mixed inflammatory response with more M1s, M2s, T effector cells, and Tregs, and decreased rates of infection of peritoneal exudative cells (PECs). These data suggested that type III parasites need the early ROP16-associated M2 response to avoid clearance, possibly by the Immunity-Related GTPases (IRGs), IFN-{gamma} dependent proteins essential for murine defenses against Toxoplasma. To test this possibility, we infected IRG-deficient mice and found that III{Delta}rop16 parasites now maintained parental levels of PECs infection. Collectively, these studies suggest that, for the type III strain, rop16III plays a key role in parasite persistence and influences the sub-acute CNS immune response.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryToxoplasma is a ubiquitous intracellular parasite that establishes an asymptomatic brain infection in immunocompetent individuals. However, in the immunocompromised and the developing fetus, Toxoplasma can cause problems ranging from fever to chorioretinitis to severe toxoplasmic encephalitis. Emerging evidence suggests that the genotype of the infecting Toxoplasma strain may influence these outcomes, possibly through the secretion of Toxoplasma strain-specific polymorphic effector proteins that trigger different host cell signaling pathways. While such strain-specific modulation of host cell signaling has been shown to affect acute immune responses, it is unclear how these differences influence the sub-acute or chronic responses in the CNS, the major organ affected in symptomatic disease. This study shows that genetically distinct strains of Toxoplasma provoke strain-specific CNS immune responses and that, for one strain (type III), the acute and sub-acute immune responses and parasite survival are heavily influenced by a polymorphic parasite gene (rop16III).",

    "abstract": "Reactivation of latent Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) is closely linked to hematopoiesis. Viral latency requires maintenance of the progenitor cell quiescence, while reactivation initiates following mobilization of HPCs to the periphery and differentiation into CD14+ macrophages. Early growth response gene 1 (EGR-1) is a transcription factor activated by Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling that is essential for the maintenance of CD34+ HPC self-renewal in the bone marrow niche. Down-regulation of EGR-1 results in mobilization and differentiation of CD34+ HPC from the bone marrow to the periphery. In the current study we demonstrate that the transcription factor EGR-1 is directly targeted for down-regulation by HCMV miR-US22 that results in decreased proliferation of CD34+ HPCs and a decrease in total hematopoietic colony formation. We also show that an HCMV miR-US22 mutant fails to reactivate in CD34+ HPCs, indicating that expression of EGR-1 inhibits viral reactivation during latency. Since EGR-1 promotes CD34+ HPC self-renewal in the bone marrow niche, HCMV miR-US22 down-regulation of EGR-1 is a necessary step to block HPC self-renewal and proliferation to induce a cellular differentiation pathway necessary to promote reactivation of virus.\\n\\nAuthor summaryHuman cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a widespread herpesvirus that persists in the host and remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in solid organ and stem cell transplant patients.

In this study, we show that HCMV miR-US22 targets Early growth response gene 1 (EGR-1) a host transcription factor that is necessary for stem cell quiescence and self-renewal in the bone marrow. Expression of this miR-US22 down-regulates expression of EGR-1 that reduces CD34+ HPCs proliferation and total hematopoietic colony formation. An HCMV miR-US22 mutant is unable to reactivate from latency suggesting that the ability of the miRNA to disrupt CD34+ HPC renewal in the bone marrow niche to initiate a differentiation pathway is critical for viral reactivation.",

    "abstract": "Upon host cell infection, the obligate intracellular bacterium C. burnetii resides and multiplies within the Coxiella-Containing Vacuole (CCV). The nascent CCV progresses through the endosomal maturation pathway into a phagolysosome, acquiring lysosomal markers as well as acidic pH and active proteases and hydrolases. Approximately 24-48 hours post infection, heterotypic fusion between the CCV and host endosomes/lysosomes leads to CCV expansion and subsequent bacterial replication in the mature CCV. Initial CCV acidification is required to activate C. burnetii metabolism and the Type 4B Secretion System (T4BSS), which secretes effector proteins required for CCV maturation. However, we recently found that the mature CCV is less acidic (pH~5.2) than lysosomes (pH~4.8). Further, CCV acidification to pH~4.8 causes C. burnetii lysis, suggesting C. burnetii actively regulates CCV pH. Because heterotypic fusion with host endosomes/lysosomes may influence CCV pH, we investigated endosomal maturation in cells infected with wildtype (WT) or T4BSS mutant ({Delta}dotA) C. burnetii. We observed significantly fewer LAMP1-positive lysosomes, along with less acidic \\\"mature\\\" endosomes (pH~5.8), in WT-infected cells, compared to mock or {Delta}dotA-infected cells. Further, while endosomes progressively acidified from the periphery (pH~5.5) to the perinuclear area (pH~4.7) in both mock and {Delta}dotA-infected cells, endosomes did not acidify beyond pH~5.2 in WT-infected cells, indicating that the C. burnetii T4BSS inhibits endosomal maturation. Finally, increasing the number of acidic lysosomes by overexpressing the transcription factor EB inhibited C. burnetii growth, indicating lysosomes are detrimental to C. burnetii. Overall, our data suggest that C. burnetii regulates CCV pH, possibly by reducing the number of host lysosomes available for heterotypic fusion.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe obligate intracellular bacterium Coxiella burnetii causes human Q fever, which manifests as a flu-like illness but can develop into a life-threatening and difficult to treat endocarditis. C. burnetii, in contrast to many other intracellular bacteria, thrives within a lysosome-like vacuole in host cells. However, we previously found that the C. burnetii vacuole is not as acidic as lysosomes and increased acidification kills the bacteria, suggesting that C. burnetii regulates the pH of its vacuole. Here, we discovered that C. burnetii blocks endosomal maturation and acidification during host cell infection, resulting in fewer lysosomes in the host cell. Moreover, increasing lysosomes in the host cells blocked C. burnetii growth. Together, our study suggests that C. burnetii regulates vacuole acidity and blocks endosomal acidification in order to produce a permissive intracellular niche.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCrystal violet (CV) was used for several years in blood banks to eliminate the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi in endemic areas in order to prevent transfusion-transmitted Chagas disease. One mechanism of action described for CV involves inhibition of proline uptake. In T. cruzi, proline is essential for host cell infection and intracellular differentiation among other processes, and can be obtained through the proline permease TcAAAP069.\\n\\nMethodology/Principal FindingsCV inhibited proline transporter TcAAAP069 and parasites overexpressing this permease were 47-fold more sensitive to this compound than control parasites. Using CV as reference molecule, loratadine, cyproheptadine, olanzapine and clofazimine were identified as structurally related compounds to CV (structural analogues) by in silico drug repurposing through a similarity-based virtual screening protocol. All these already-approved drugs for clinical use inhibited TcAAAP069 activity with different efficacies and also presented trypanocidal action in epimastigotes, trypomastigotes and amastigotes of the Y strain. Additionally, loratadine, cyproheptadine and clofazimine showed trypanocidal effect on epimastigotes of the CL Brener and DM28c strains. Finally, a synergistic effect between benznidazole and the CV chemical analogues was evidenced by combination and dose-reduction indexes values in epimastigotes of the Y strain.\\n\\nConclusions/SignificanceLoratadine, cyproheptadine and clofazimine inhibit TcAAAP069 proline transporter and also present trypanocidal effect against all T. cruzi life stages. These CV structural analogues could be a starting point to design therapeutic alternatives to treat Chagas disease by finding new indications for old drugs. This approach, called drug repurposing is a recommended strategy by the World Health Organization to treat neglected diseases, like Chagas disease, and combination therapy may improve the possibility of success of repositioned drugs.\\n\\nAuthor summaryChagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, affects 7 million people worldwide. Despite there are two drugs available since 50 years ago, the therapy present severe side effects and is not effective in the chronic phase of the disease were most of the patients are diagnosed. Crystal violet (CV) was utilized as additive in blood banks to prevent transfusion-transmitted Chagas disease. Proline is involved in many pathways, like infection establishment and life cycle progression. In this work we first demonstrate that CV has the proline permease TcAAAP069 as one of its molecular targets. Then we search in a database of already-approved drugs for compounds that were structurally related to CV under the premise \\\"similar structure, similar activity\\\". We identified three drugs that inhibit proline transport and present at least the same trypanocidal effect than benznidazole, the current treatment for Chagas disease. Finally we observed a synergistic effect with the multidrug combination therapy. Drug discovery is an expensive and time-consuming process and Chagas disease is associated with poverty. The discovery of new indications to old drugs, called drug repurposing, can facilitate a rapid and more profitable therapy application since preclinical trials and pharmacokinetic studies are already available.",

However, map interpretation can be challenging, in particular if the constituting structures require de-novo model building or are very mobile. Here, we demonstrate the potential of convolutional neural networks for the annotation of Cryo-EM maps: our network Haruspex has been trained on a carefully curated set of 293 experimentally derived reconstruction maps to automatically annotate protein secondary structure elements as well as RNA/DNA. It can be straightforwardly applied to annotate newly reconstructed maps to support domain placement or to supply a starting point for main-chain placement. Due to its high recall and precision rates of 95.1% and 80.3%, respectively, on an independent test set of 122 maps, it can also be used for validation during model building. The trained network will be available as part of the CCP-EM suite.",

    "abstract": "The neurotrophin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) promotes central nervous system (CNS) myelination during development and after injury. This is achieved via activation of oligodendrocyte-expressed tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk) B receptors. However, while administration of BDNF has shown beneficial effects, BDNF itself has a poor pharmacokinetic profile. Here, we compare two TrkB-targeted BDNF-mimetics, the structural-mimetic, tricyclic dimeric peptide-6 (TDP6) and the non-peptide small molecule TrkB agonist LM22A-4 in the cuprizone model of central demyelination in female mice. Both mimetics promoted remyelination, increasing myelin sheath thickness and oligodendrocyte densities after one-week recovery. Importantly, LM22A-4 exerts these effects in an oligodendroglial TrkB-dependent manner. However, analysis of TrkB signaling by LM22A-4 suggests rather than direct activation of TrkB, LM22A-4 exerts its effects via indirect transactivation of Trk receptors. Overall, these studies support the therapeutic strategy to selectively targeting TrkB activation to promote remyelination in the brain.",

    "abstract": "We propose a new model of the read-out of spike trains that exploits the multivariate structure of responses of neural ensembles. Assuming the point of view of a read-out neuron that receives synaptic inputs from a population of projecting neurons, synaptic inputs are weighted with a heterogeneous set of weights. We propose that synaptic weights reflect the role of each neuron within the population for the computational task that the network has to solve. In our case, the computational task is discrimination of binary classes of stimuli, and weights are such as to maximize the discrimination capacity of the network. We compute synaptic weights as the feature weights of an optimal linear classifier. Once weights have been learned, they weight spike trains and allow to compute the post-synaptic current that modulates the spiking probability of the read-out unit in real time. We apply the model on parallel spike trains from V1 and V4 areas in the behaving monkey macaca mulatta, while the animal is engaged in a visual discrimination task with binary classes of stimuli. The read-out of spike trains with our model allows to discriminate the two classes of stimuli, while population PSTH entirely fails to do so. Splitting neurons in two subpopulations according to the sign of the weight, we show that population signals of the two functional subnetworks are negatively correlated. Disentangling the superficial, the middle and the deep layer of the cortex, we show that in both V1 and V4, superficial layers are the most important in discriminating binary classes of stimuli.",

KSs recognize multiple ACPs and choreograph ping-pong mechanisms often in an iterative fashion. Therefore, KSs must limit non-productive protein-protein interactions (PPIs) to achieve high degrees of reaction fidelity. To better understand the stereochemical features governing substrate discrimination during ACP*KS PPIs, we determined x-ray crystal structures complemented by molecular dynamic simulations of E. coli AcpP in complex with the elongating KSs, FabF and FabB. Covalently trapped substrate analogs were used to interrogate critical catalytic events accompanying carbon-carbon bond formation revealing a previously unknown gating mechanism during the binding and delivery of acyl-AcpPs. Two active site loops undergo large conformational excursions during this dynamic gating mechanism and are likely evolutionarily conserved features generally in elongating KSs.",

    "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a diverse class of transcripts that structurally resemble mRNAs but do not encode proteins, and lncRNAs have been proved to play pivotal roles in a wide range of biological processes in animals and plants. However, knowledge of expression pattern and potential role of honeybee lncRNAs response to Nosema ceranae infection is completely unknown. Here, we performed whole transcriptome strand-specific RNA sequencing of normal midguts of Apis mellifera ligustica workers (Am7CK, Am10CK) and N. ceranae-inoculated midguts (Am7T, Am10T), followed by comprehensive analyses using bioinformatic and molecular approaches. A total of 6353 A. m. ligustica lncRNAs were identified, including 4749 conserved lncRNAs and 1604 novel lncRNAs. These lncRNAs had low sequence similarities with other known lncRNAs in other species; however, their structural features were similar with counterparts in mammals and plants, including shorter exon and intron length, lower exon number, and lower expression level, compared with protein-coding transcripts. Further, 111 and 146 N. ceranae-responsive lncRNAs were identified from midguts at 7 day post inoculation (dpi) and 10 dpi compared with control midguts. 12 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) were shared by Am7CK vs Am7T and Am10CK vs Am10T comparison groups, while the numbers of unique ones were 99 and 134, respectively. Functional annotation and pathway analysis showed the DElncRNAs may regulate the expression of neighboring genes by acting in cis. Moreover, we discovered 27 lncRNAs harboring eight known miRNA precursors and 513 lncRNAs harboring 2257 novel miRNA precursors. Additionally, hundreds of DElncRNAs and their target miRNAs were found to form complex competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks, suggesting these DElncRNAs may act as miRNA sponges. Furthermore, DElncRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks were constructed and investigated, the result demonstrated that part of DElncRNAs were likely to participate in regulating the material and energy metabolism as well as cellular and humoral immune during host responses to N. ceranae invasion. Finally, the expression pattern of 10 DElncRNAs was validated using RT-qPCR, confirming the reliability of our sequencing data. Our findings revealed here offer not only a rich genetic resource for further investigation of the functional roles of lncRNAs involved in A. m. ligustica response to N. ceranae infection, but also a novel insight into understanding host-pathogen interaction during microsporidiosis of honeybee.",

Here, advanced fluorescence imaging and spectroscopy approaches were applied on in vitro (model membranes) and in vivo (live cells and embryos) membranes to systematically study the nanoscale dynamics of cholesterol in biological membranes. The results show that cholesterol diffuses faster than phospholipids in live membranes, but not in model membranes. The data indicate that diffusion of cholesterol and phospholipids is not correlated with membrane domain partitioning. Instead, our data show that the fast diffusion of cholesterol is due to its nanoscale interactions and localization in the membrane.",

These eGFP-positive cells lie at the extreme apical part of the neuronal layer and are most numerous in dorsal-medial regions of olfactory epithelium. Interestingly, we observed a corresponding small number of glomeruli in the olfactory bulb wherein eGFP-labeled axons terminate, suggesting that the population of eGFP+ receptor cells expresses a limited number of olfactory receptors. Similarly, a subset of vomeronasal sensory neurons express eGFP but these distribute throughout the full height of the vomeronasal sensory epithelium. In keeping with this broad distribution of labeled vomeronasal receptor cells, eGFP labeled axons terminate in many glomeruli of the accessory olfactory bulb. These findings suggest that Foxj1-driven eGFP marks a specific population of olfactory and vomeronasal sensory neurons although neither receptor cell population possess motile cilia.",

All cortical projection neurons arise from a uniform pool of progenitor cells that lines the ventricles of the forebrain. It is still unclear how these progenitor cells generate the more than fifty unique types of mature cortical projection neurons defined by their distinct gene expression profiles. Here we compare gene expression and chromatin accessibility of two subclasses of projection neurons with divergent morphological and functional features as they develop in the mouse brain between embryonic day 13 and postnatal day 5 in order to identify transcriptional networks that diversity neuron cell fate. We find groups of transcription factors whose expression is correlated with chromatin accessibility, transcription factor binding motifs, and lncRNAs that define each subclass and validate the function of a family of novel candidate genes in vitro. Our multidimensional approach reveals that subclass-specific chromatin accessibility is significantly correlated with gene expression, providing a resource for generating new specific genetic drivers and revealing regions of the genome that are particularly susceptible to harmful genetic mutations by virtue of their correlation with important developmental genes.",

Laurel wilt, caused by the vector-borne forest pathogen Raffaelea lauricola, has devastated populations of native Lauraceae in the Southeastern US, and continues to spread. We surveyed 87 plots in six coastal islands in South Carolina, Georgia and North Florida, and one inland site (Archbold Biological Station) in South Florida for laurel wilt-affected and non-affected individual plants belonging to the genus Persea. The coastal island sites were surveyed once in 2008 or 2009, and the inland site was surveyed eight times from 2011 to 2013. Disease incidence per plot ranged from 0% to 96%, with mean disease incidence 45% across all sites. Disease incidence was positively correlated with trunk diameter and density of hosts with trunk diameter > 5 cm, but negatively with the degree of clustering, which was highest for small trees. A recursive partitioning model indicated that higher disease incidence was associated with moderate temperatures, wider trunk diameter, lower relative humidity, and lower wind speeds. Disease progress over time at Archbold followed a Gompertz curve, plateauing at 3% in two years. The dispersal kernel for disease incidence from a focus followed a negative exponential distribution. The number of plots with diseased trees at Archbold was similar for redbay (P. borbonia) and swampbay (P. palustris), but was lower for silkbay (P. humilis).

This paper presents methods to calculate modified effective codon numbers that allow the investigation of the sources of codon bias and how genes or organisms have their codon biases shaped. In particular, it demonstrates that variation in codon usage bias across organisms is likely driven more by likely mutational forces while the variation in codon usage bias within genomes is likely driven by codon selectional forces.\n\nAuthor summaryA new method of disaggregating codon bias influences is described where I show how that different values of the effective codon number, following Wrights Nc, can be used as ratios to demonstrate the similar or different causes of codon biases across genes or organisms. By calculating ratios of the different types of effective codon numbers, one can easily compare organisms or different genes while controlling for gene G+C content or codon nucleotide G+C content. The driving forces determining the variations in codon usage bias across or within organisms thus become much clearer.",

    "abstract": "The 3D organization of the genome plays a key role in many cellular processes, such as gene regulation, differentiation, and replication. Assays like Hi-C measure DNA-DNA contacts in a high-throughput fashion, and inferring accurate 3D models of chromosomes can yield insights hidden in the raw data. For example, structural inference can account for noise in the data, disambiguate the distinct structures of homologous chromosomes, orient genomic regions relative to nuclear landmarks, and serve as a framework for integrating other data types. Although many methods exist to infer the 3D structure of haploid genomes, inferring a diploid structure from Hi-C data is still an open problem. Indeed, the diploid case is very challenging, because Hi-C data typically does not distinguish between homologous chromosomes. We propose a method to infer 3D diploid genomes from Hi-C data. We demonstrate the accuarcy of the method on simulated data, and we also use the method to infer 3D structures for mouse chromosome X, confirming that the active homolog exhibits a bipartite structure, whereas the active homolog does not.",

The Ala986Ser SNP was positively associated with hypercalcemia. Carriers of Ala986Ser had a significantly increased CAD risk whereas Arg990Gly carriers had a reduced risk relative to the reference SNP, for those with albumin-corrected serum calcium from 8.5-9.5 mg/dL. In the context of the tri-locus haplotype, the reduced CAD risk conferred by Arg990Gly remained significant. Analysis of the association of common CASR SNPs with CAD risk factors showed Arg990Gly was negatively associated with the CAD risk factor of chronic kidney disease, but independent of alterations in lipids, hemoglobin A1c, or blood pressure.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study compares the common approach of single SNP analysis with the impact of a common variant haplotype block and refocuses attention on the CaSR Arg990Gly SNP which reduces the risk of CAD over a specific range of median albumin-corrected calcium concentrations.\\n\\nPrecisClinical data and whole exome sequences from a cohort of 51,289 individuals (DiscovEHR) were used to assess the independent contributions of serum Ca2+ and CASR common variants to cardiovascular diseases including CAD.",

While a growing body of work has investigated the neurocognitive basis of EA, the neurocomputational processes underlying this ability have received limited attention. Here, we present a formal Active Inference (AI) model of emotion conceptualization that can simulate the neurocomputational (Bayesian) processes associated with learning about emotion concepts and inferring the emotions one is feeling in a given moment. We validate the model and inherent constructs by showing (i) it can successfully acquire a repertoire of emotion concepts in its \"childhood\", as well as (ii) acquire new emotion concepts in synthetic \"adulthood,\" and (iii) that these learning processes depend on early experiences, environmental stability, and habitual patterns of selective attention. These results offer a proof of principle that cognitive-emotional processes can be modeled formally, and highlight the potential for both theoretical and empirical extensions of this line of research on emotion and emotional disorders.",

Here, we used head-restrained mice to accurately control the timing of sucrose water as an unconditioned stimulus (US); we found that the reinforcement effect of the US occurred only within 1 s after a short tone of a conditioned stimulus (CS). The conditioning required the dopamine D1 receptor and CaMKII signaling in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). The time window was not reduced by replacing CS with optogenetic stimulation of the synaptic inputs to the NAc, which is in agreement with previous reports on the effective dopamine timing of NAc synapses.

    "abstract": "In a commentary published in eNeuro, Gardner & Liu (2019) discuss the role of model specification in interpreting the output of complex models of neural data. As a case study, they suggest that one variant of such analyses, the inverted encoding model (IEM) analysis framework, should not be used to assay properties of \\\"stimulus representations\\\" because the ability to apply linear transformations at various stages of the analysis procedure renders results  arbitrary. As we discuss, the specification of all models is arbitrary to the extent that an experimenter makes choices based on current knowledge of the model system. However, the results derived from any given model, such as the reconstructed channel response profiles obtained from an IEM analysis, are uniquely defined and are arbitrary only in the sense that changes in the model can predictably change results. Moreover, with knowledge of the model used for IEM analyses, the results remain informative as comparisons between reconstructed channel response profiles across task conditions using a fixed encoding model - the most common use of the IEM technique - can generally capture changes in population-level representation magnitude across linear transformations. Thus, changes in the magnitude of the response profiles across conditions are preserved, even across unprincipled linear transforms. IEM-based channel response profiles should therefore not be considered arbitrary when the model is clearly specified and guided by our best understanding of neural population representations in the brain regions being analyzed. Intuitions derived from this case study are important to consider when interpreting results from all model-based analyses, which are similarly contingent upon the specification of the models used.",

    "abstract": "There is growing attention surrounding hospital acquired infections (HAIs) due to high associated healthcare costs, compounded by the scourge of widespread multi-antibiotic resistance. Although hospital environment disinfection is well acknowledged to be key for infection control, an understanding of colonization patterns and resistome profiles of environment-dwelling microbes is currently lacking. We report the first extensive genomic characterization of microbiomes (428), common HAI-associated microbes (891) and transmissible drug resistance cassettes (1435) in a tertiary hospital environment based on a 3-timepoint sampling (1 week and >1 year apart) of 179 sites from 45 beds. Deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing unveiled two distinct ecological niches of microbes and antibiotic resistance genes characterized by biofilm-forming and human microbiome influenced environments that display corresponding patterns of divergence over space and time. To study common nosocomial pathogens that were typically present at low abundances, a combination of culture enrichment and long-read nanopore sequencing was used to obtain thousands of high contiguity genomes (2347), phage sequences (1693) and closed plasmids (5910), a significant fraction of which (>60%) are not represented in current sequence databases. These high-quality assemblies and metadata enabled a rich characterization of resistance gene combinations, phage diversity, plasmid architectures, and the dynamic nature of hospital environment resistomes and their reservoirs. Phylogenetic analysis identified multidrug resistant strains as being more widely distributed and stably colonizing across hospital sites. Further genomic comparisons with clinical isolates across multiple species supports the hypothesis that multidrug resistant strains can persist in the hospital environment for extended periods (>8 years) to opportunistically infect patients. These findings highlight the importance of characterizing antibiotic resistance reservoirs in the hospital environment and establishes the feasibility of systematic genomic surveys to help target resources more efficiently for preventing HAIs.",

However, the relative contribution of these connection to the current biotic assembly of the subcontinent is still under-explored. We aimed to understand the relative importance of these various routes of biotic assembly in India through studying the historical biogeography of tropical Old World freshwater snail genus Pila. We reconstructed a near-complete phylogeny of Ampullariidae including all the described Pila species from India and published sequences of Ampullariids from all over the world from two mitochondrial and two nuclear markers. Thereafter molecular dating and ancestral area reconstruction analyses were carried out in order to ascertain the time frame and route of colonization of India. The results suggest that Pila dispersed into India as well as other parts of tropical Asia from Africa after both India and Africa collided with Eurasia. Furthermore, multiple dispersals have taken place between Southeast Asia and India. The findings consolidate the rapidly building evidence that much of the current assemblage of biota actually dispersed into-India after it collided with Asia.",

    "abstract": "A cerebral stroke is characterized by compromised brain function due to an interruption in cerebrovascular blood supply. Although stroke incurs focal damage determined by the vascular territory affected, clinical symptoms commonly involve multiple functions and cognitive faculties that are insufficiently explained by the focal damage alone. Functional connectivity (FC) refers to the synchronous activity between spatially remote brain regions organized in a network of interconnected brain regions. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has advanced this system-level understanding of brain function, elucidating the complexity of stroke outcomes, as well as providing information useful for prognostic and rehabilitation purposes.\\n\\nWe tested for differences in brain network connectivity between a group of patients with minor ischemic strokes in sub-acute phase (n=44) and matched controls (n=100). As neural network configuration is dependent on cognitive effort, we obtained fMRI data during rest and two load levels of a multiple object tacking (MOT) task. Network nodes and time-series were estimated using independent component analysis (ICA) and dual regression, with network edges defined as the partial temporal correlations between node pairs. The full set of edgewise FC went into a cross-validated regularized linear discriminant analysis (rLDA) to classify groups and cognitive load.\\n\\nMOT task performance and cognitive tests revealed no significant group differences. While multivariate machine learning revealed high sensitivity to experimental condition, with classification accuracies between rest and attentive tracking approaching 100%, group classification was at chance level, with negligible differences between conditions. Repeated measures ANOVA showed significantly stronger synchronization between a temporal node and a sensorimotor node in patients across conditions. Overall, the results revealed high sensitivity of FC indices to task conditions, and suggest relatively small brain network-level disturbances after clinically mild strokes.",

    "abstract": "The neurophysiological basis of motor processes and their control is of tremendous interest to basic researchers and clinicians alike. Notably, both movement initiation and cancellation are accompanied by prominent field potential changes in the {beta}-frequency band (15-29Hz). In trial-averages, movement initiation is indexed by {beta}-band desynchronization over sensorimotor sites, while movement cancellation is signified by {beta}-power increases over (pre)frontal areas. However, averaging misrepresents the true nature of the {beta}-signal. As recent work has highlighted, raw {beta}-band activity is characterized by short-lasting, burst-like events, rather than by steady modulations. To investigate how such {beta}-bursts relate to movement initiation and cancellation in humans, we investigated scalp-recorded {beta}-band activity in 234 healthy subjects performing the Stop-signal task. Four observations were made: First, both movement initiation and cancellation were indexed by systematic, localized changes in {beta}-bursting. While {beta}-bursting at bilateral sensorimotor sites steadily declined during movement initiation, {beta}-bursting increased at fronto-central sites when Stop-signals instructed movement cancellation. Second, the amount of fronto-central {beta}-bursting clearly distinguished successful from unsuccessful movement cancellation. Third, the emergence of fronto-central {beta}-bursting coincided with the latency of the movement cancellation process, indexed by Stop-signal reaction time. Fourth, individual fronto-central {beta}-bursts during movement cancellation were followed by a low-latency re-instantiation of bilateral sensorimotor {beta}-bursting. These findings suggest that {beta}-bursting is a fundamental signature of the motor system, reflecting a steady inhibition of motor cortex that is suppressed during movement initiation, and can be rapidly re-instantiated by frontal areas when movements have to be rapidly cancelled.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMovement-related {beta}-frequency (15-29Hz) changes are among the most prominent features of neural recordings across species, scales, and methods. However, standard averaging-based methods obscure the true dynamics of {beta}-band activity, which is dominated by short-lived, burst-like events. Here, we demonstrate that both movement-initiation and cancellation in humans are characterized by unique trial-to-trial patterns of {beta}-bursting. Movement initiation is characterized by steady reductions of {beta}-bursting over bilateral sensorimotor sites. In contrast, during rapid movement cancellation, {beta}-bursts first emerge over fronto-central sites typically associated with motor control, after which sensorimotor {beta}-bursting re-initiates. These findings suggest a fundamentally novel, non-invasive measure of the neural interaction underlying movement-initiation and -cancellation, opening new avenues for the study of motor control in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy remains a difficult-to-treat neurological disorder prompting the need for new therapies that work via alternate mechanisms. Levetiracetam (LEV) is the first in a series of anti-epilepsy drugs that target presynaptic functioning. LEV binds the synaptic vesicle protein SV2A, and has been shown to decrease neurotransmitter release in hippocampal slices. The molecular basis of LEV action is unknown, however, and direct effects of LEV on SV2A function remain to be determined. SV2A is the most widely expressed paralog of a three-gene family (SV2A, B, C) that is variably co-expressed throughout the CNS. All three SV2s bind the calcium sensor protein synaptotagmin and SV2 plays a crucial role in synaptotagmin stability and trafficking. Here we addressed the action of LEV at the cellular and molecular level asking whether the presence of non-LEV binding SV2 paralogs influences drug action and whether LEV impacts SV2As role in synaptotagmin function. We report that LEV altered short-term synaptic plasticity in isolated neurons from SV2B knockout but not wild-type mice, mimicking the loss of SV2 function. Similarly, LEV reduced SV2A binding to synaptotagmin only in the absence of SV2B. Furthermore, LEV reduced and slowed the internalization of synaptotagmin in neurons cultured from SV2B KO but not WT mice. Taken together, these findings suggest that LEV alters synaptic release probability by disrupting SV2s regulation of synaptotagmin selectively in neurons that express only SV2A. Neurons that meet this requirement include most inhibitory neurons and the granule cells of the dentate gyrus, two classes of neuron implicated in epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic biodegradable polymers including poly(lactic acid) (PLA) are attractive cell culture substrates because their surfaces can be micropatterned to support cell adhesion. The cell adhesion properties of a scaffold mainly depend on its surface chemical and structural features; however, it remains unclear how these characteristics affect the growth and differentiation of cultured cells or their gene expression. In this study, we fabricated two differently structured PLA nanosheets: flat and microgrooved. We assessed the growth and differentiation of mouse primary cultured cortical neurons on these two types of nanosheets after pre-coating with poly-D-lysine and vitronectin. Interestingly, prominent neurite bundles were formed along the grooves on the microgrooved nanosheets, whereas thin and randomly extended neurites were only observed on the flat nanosheets. Comparative RNA sequencing analyses revealed that the expression of genes related to postsynaptic density, dendritic shafts, and asymmetric synapses was significantly and consistently up-regulated in cells cultured on the microgrooved nanosheets when compared with those cultured on the flat nanosheets. These results indicate that microgrooved PLA nanosheets can provide a powerful means of establishing a culture system for the efficient and reproducible differentiation of neurons, which will facilitate future investigations of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of neurological disorders.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic cells can migrate using different modes, ranging from amoeboid-like, during which actin filled protrusions come and go, to keratocyte-like, characterized by a stable morphology and persistent motion. How cells can switch between these modes is still not well understood but waves of signaling events on the cell cortex are thought to play an important role in these transitions. Here we present a simple two component biochemical reaction-diffusion model based on relaxation oscillators and couple this to a model for the mechanics of cell deformations. Different migration modes, including amoeboid-like and keratocyte-like, naturally emerge through phase transitions determined by interactions between biochemical traveling waves, cell mechanics and morphology. The model predictions are explicitly verified by systematically reducing the protrusive force of the actin network in experiments using wild-type Dictyostelium discoideum cells. Our results indicate the importance of coupling signaling events to cell mechanics and morphology and may be applicable in a wide variety of cell motility systems.",

    "abstract": "Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent programmed cell death resulting from alterations of metabolic processes. However, its regulation and physiological significance remain to be elucidated. By analyzing transcriptional responses of murine embryonic fibroblasts exposed to the ferroptosis-inducer erastin, we found that a set of genes related to oxidative stress protection was induced upon ferroptosis. We further showed that the transcription factor BACH1 promoted ferroptosis by repressing the expression of a subset of erastin-inducible genes involved in the synthesis of glutathione or metabolism of intracellular labile iron, including Gclm, Gclc, Slc7a11, Hmox1, Fth1, Ftl1, and Slc40a1. Compared with wild-type mice, Bach1-/- mice showed resistance to myocardial infarction, the seriousness of which was palliated by the iron-chelator deferasirox, which suppressed ferroptosis. Our findings suggest that ferroptosis is programmed at the transcriptional level to induce genes combating labile-iron-induced oxidative stress and executed upon disruption of the balance between the transcriptional induction of protective genes and accumulation of iron-mediated damage. BACH1 is suggested to control the threshold of ferroptosis and to be a therapeutic target for palliating myocardial infarction.",

    "abstract": "During embryonic development, cells undergo changes in gene expression, signaling pathway activation/inactivation, metabolism, and intracellular organelle structures, which are mediated by mitochondria. Mitochondria continuously switch their morphology between elongated tubular and fragmented globular via mitochondrial fusion and fission. Mitochondrial fusion is mediated by proteins encoded by Mfn1, Mfn2, and Opa1, whereas mitochondrial fission is mediated by proteins encoded by Fis1 and Dmn1L. Here, we investigated the expression patterns of mitochondria-related genes during the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in response to leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) withdrawal. The expression of Mfn2 and Dnm1L was, as expected, increased and decreased, respectively. By comparing gene expression and mitochondrial morphology, we proposed an index that could precisely represent mitochondrial changes during the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells by analyzing the expression ratios of three fusion- and two fission-related genes. Surprisingly, increased Mfn2/Dnm1L ratio was correlated with elongation of mitochondria during the differentiation of ESCs. Moreover, application of this index to other specialized cell types revealed that neural stems cells (NSCs) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) showed increased Mfn2/Dnm1L ratio compared to ESCs. Thus, we suggest that the Mfn2/Dnm1L ratio could reflect changes in mitochondrial morphology according to the extent of differentiation.",

Here, we develop statistical modelling of yield losses by French department based on weather, soil and epidemiological data for 13 diseases and 12 insect pests of grain crops over 8 years. Those environmental factors explain up to 90% of yield variations (wheat). Weather and soil quality are first order determinants as manifested both by direct assessment and by strongly correlated yields of even taxonomically very different crops. Bioagressors are important second order determinants: losses of 5 qx/ha (~7%) on wheat and 2 qx/ha (~15%) on winter oilseed rape. Across models based on conceptually different achievable yields, only Septoria tritici and Sitobion avenae on wheat, and Ceutorhynchus picitarsis and Ceutorhynchus assimilis on winter oilseed rape are consistently and significantly detrimental to yield. Those bioagressors seem not fully controlled which is compatible with empirical observations in the non academical litterature.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIGrain crop yields of similar growing seasons are highly correlated\\nC_LIO_LIEnvironmental determinants explain up to 90% of yield variations\\nC_LIO_LIBioagressors induced yield variations of 5 to 20%\\nC_LIO_LISpecific pests and diseases with less than perfect control are identified\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "We deduce the directional step distribution of yeast dynein motor protein on the microtubule surface by combing intrinsic features of the dynein and microtubule. These include the probability distribution of the separation vector between the two microtubule binding domains (MTBDs), the angular probability distribution of a single MTBD translation, the existence of a microtubule seam defect, microtubule binding sites, and theoretical extension that accounts for a load force on the motor. Our predictions are in excellent accord with the measured longitudinal step size distributions at various load forces. Moreover, we predict the side-step distribution and its dependence on longitudinal load forces, which shows a few surprising features. First, the distribution is broad. Second, in the absence of load, we find a small right-hand bias. Third, the side-step bias is susceptible to the longitudinal load force; it vanishes at a load equal to the motor stalling force and changes to a left-hand bias above that value. Fourth, our results are sensitive to the ability of the motor to explore the seam several times during its walk. While available measurements of side-way distribution are limited, our findings are amenable to experimental check and, moreover, suggest a diversity of results depending on whether the microtubule seam is viable to motor sampling.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe function of microtubule (MT) associated protein motors, kinesin and dynein, is essential for a myriad of intracellular processes. Different measurements on yeast cytoplasmic-dynein stepping characteristics appear to be unrelated to each other. We provide a unified physical-statistical model that combines these seemingly independent features with a theoretical expression that accounts for the exertion of a longitudinal load force, to yield the longitudinal step distribution at various load forces. The latter is in excellent accord with the measured distributions. Moreover, we deduce the side-step distribution, which surprisingly is susceptible to longitudinal load forces and comprises a right or left bias. This side-way bias is consistent with observations of helical motion of a nanoparticle carried by a number of motors.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal extracellular vesicles (EVs) play important roles in intercellular communication and pathogenic protein propagation in neurological disease. However, it remains unclear how cargoes are selectively packaged into neuronal EVs. Here, we show that loss of the endosomal retromer complex leads to accumulation of EV cargoes Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) and Synaptotagmin-4 (Syt4) at Drosophila motor neuron presynaptic terminals, resulting in increased release of these cargoes in EVs. By systematically exploring known retromer-dependent trafficking mechanisms, we show that EV regulation is separable from several previously identified roles of neuronal retromer, and depends on the ESCPE-1 complex. Conversely, loss of the recycling endosome regulator rab11 leads to reduced EV cargo levels, and suppresses cargo accumulation in retromer mutants. Thus, EV traffic reflects a balance between Rab11-mediated loading and retromer-dependent removal from EV precursor compartments. Our data shed light on previous studies implicating Rab11 and retromer in competing pathways in Alzheimers Disease, and suggest that misregulated EV traffic may be an underlying defect.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila sensory organ precursors divide asymmetrically to generate pIIa/pIIb cells whose identity relies on the differential activation of Notch during cytokinesis. While Notch is present apically and basally relative to the midbody at the pIIa-pIIb interface, only the basal pool of Notch is reported to contribute to Notch activation in the pIIa cell. Such proper intra-lineage signalling therefore requires appropriate apico-basal targeting of Notch, its ligand Delta and its trafficking partner Sanpodo. We previously reported that AP-1 and Stratum regulate the intracellular trafficking of Notch and Sanpodo from the trans-Golgi network to basolateral membrane. Loss of AP-1 or of Stratum caused mild Notch phenotype. Here, we report that the concomitant loss of AP-1 and Stratum result in the stabilization of the apical pool of Notch, Delta and Spdo, the loss of the basal pool of Notch at the pIIa-pIIb interface, and is associated with activation of Notch in the two SOP daughters. We propose that AP-1 and Stratum control two parallel pathways towards plasma membrane and that Notch intra-lineage signalling could also occur at the apical pIIa-pIIb interface.",
