    "abstract": "Choanoflagellates are the closest unicellular relatives of animals (Metazoa). These tiny protists display complex life histories that include sessile as well as different pelagic stages. Some choanoflagellates have the ability to form colonies as well. Up until recently, these colonies have been described to consist of mostly identical cells showing no spatial cell differentiation, which supported the traditional view that spatial cell differentiation, leading to specific cell types in animals, evolved after the split of the last common ancestor of the Choanoflagellata and Metazoa. The recent discovery of single cells in colonies of the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta that exhibit unique cell morphologies challenges this traditional view. We have now reanalyzed TEM serial sections, aiming to determine the degree of similarity of S. rosetta cells within a rosette colony. We investigated cell morphologies and nuclear, mitochondrial and food vacuole volumes of 40 individual cells from four different S. rosetta rosette colonies and compared our findings to previously published data on sponge choanocytes. Our analysis show that cells in a choanoflagellate colony differ from each other in respect to cell morphology and content ratios of nuclei, mitochondria and food vacuoles. Furthermore, cell disparity within S. rosetta colonies is higher compared to cell disparity within sponge choanocytes. Moreover, we discovered the presence of plasma membrane contacts between colonial cells in addition to already described intercellular bridges and filo-/pseudopodial contacts. Our findings indicate that the last common ancestor of Choanoflagellata and Metazoa might have possessed plasma membrane contacts and spatial cell disparity during colonial life history stages.",

    "abstract": "In computer science, reinforcement learning is a powerful framework with which artificial agents can learn to maximize their performance for any given Markov decision process (MDP). Advances over the last decade, in combination with deep neural networks, have enjoyed performance advantages over humans in many difficult task settings. However, such frameworks perform far less favorably when evaluated in their ability to generalize or transfer representations across different tasks. Existing algorithms that facilitate transfer typically are limited to cases in which the transition function or the optimal policy is portable to new contexts, but achieving \"deep transfer\" characteristic of human behavior has been elusive. Such transfer typically requires discovery of abstractions that permit analogical reuse of previously learned representations to superficially distinct tasks. Here, we demonstrate that abstractions that minimize error in predictions of reward outcomes generalize across tasks with different transition and reward functions. Such reward-predictive representations compress the state space of a task into a lower dimensional representation by combining states that are equivalent in terms of both the transition and reward functions. Because only state equivalences are considered, the resulting state representation is not tied to the transition and reward functions themselves and thus generalizes across tasks with different reward and transition functions. These results contrast with those using abstractions that myopically maximize reward in any given MDP and motivate further experiments in humans and animals to investigate if neural and cognitive systems involved in state representation perform abstractions that facilitate such equivalence relations.\n\nAuthor summaryHumans are capable of transferring abstract knowledge from one task to another. For example, in a right-hand-drive country, a driver has to use the right arm to operate the shifter. A driver who learned how to drive in a right-hand-drive country can adapt to operating a left-hand-drive car and use the other arm for shifting instead of re-learning how to drive. Despite the fact that both tasks require different coordination of motor skills, both tasks are the same in an abstract sense: In both tasks, a car is operated and there is the same progression from 1st to 2nd gear and so on. We study distinct algorithms by which a reinforcement learning agent can discover state representations that encode knowledge about a particular task, and evaluate how well they can generalize. Through a sequence of simulation results, we show that state abstractions that minimize errors in prediction about future reward outcomes generalize across tasks, even those that superficially differ in both the goals (rewards) and the transitions from one state to the next. This work motivates biological studies to determine if distinct circuits are adapted to maximize reward vs. to discover useful state representations.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTransfusion-related sepsis remains an important hospital infection control challenge. Investigating septic transfusion events is often restricted by the limitations of bacterial culture in terms of time requirements and low yield in the setting of prior antibiotic administration.\\n\\nMethodsIn three Gram-negative septic transfusion cases, we performed mNGS of direct clinical blood specimens in addition to standard culture-based approaches utilized for infection control investigations. Pathogen detection leveraged IDSeq, a new open-access microbial bioinformatics portal. Phylogenetic analysis was performed to assess microbial genetic relatedness and understand transmission events.\\n\\nResultsmNGS of direct clinical blood specimens afforded precision detection of pathogens responsible for each case of transfusion-related sepsis, and enabled discovery of a novel Acinetobacter species in a platelet product that had become contaminated despite photochemical pathogen reduction. In each case, longitudinal assessment of pathogen burden elucidated the temporal sequence of events associated with each transfusion-transmitted infection. We found that informative data could be obtained from culture-independent mNGS of residual platelet products and leftover blood specimens that were either unsuitable or unavailable for culture, or that failed to grow due to prior antibiotic administration. We additionally developed methods to enhance accuracy for detecting transfusion-associated pathogens sharing taxonomic similarity to contaminants commonly found in mNGS library preparations.\\n\\nConclusionsCulture-independent mNGS of blood products afforded rapid and precise assessment of pathogen identity, abundance and genetic relatedness. Together, these challenging cases demonstrated the potential for metagenomics to advance existing methods for investigating transfusion-transmitted infections.",

Past studies have revealed differences (as well as similarities) between vison and touch in texture processing (e.g., eye is good at detecting texture boundaries, while hand can discriminate subtle texture differences), but the underlying computational differences remains poorly understood. Here we transcribed various textures as surface relief patterns by 3D-printing, and analyzed the tactile discrimination performance regarding the sensitivity to image statistics. The results suggest that touch is sensitive to texture differences in lower-order statistics (e.g., statistics of local amplitude spectrum), while may not to those in the higher-order statistics (e.g., joint statistics of local orientations). In agreement with this, we found that pairs of synthesized textures differing only in higher-order statistics were nearly indiscriminable (metameric) by touch, while easily discriminable by vision. Our findings show that touch and vision sense spatial information using different and complementary computational strategies.",

However, the role of the thalamus in this process is poorly understood.\n\nTo determine the thalamic contribution to non-REM oscillations (sharp-wave ripples, SWRs; slow/delta; spindles), we recorded units and local field potentials (LFPs) simultaneously in the limbic thalamus, mPFC, and CA1 in rats. We report that the cycles of neocortical spindles provide a key temporal window that coordinates CA1 SWRs with sparse but consistent activation of thalamic units. Thalamic units were phase-locked to delta and spindles in mPFC, and fired at consistent lags with other thalamic units within spindles, while CA1 units that were active during spatial exploration were engaged in SWR-coupled spindles after behavior. The sparse thalamic firing could promote an incremental integration of recently acquired memory traces into neocortical schemas through the interleaved activation of thalamocortical cells.",

    "abstract": "Parental provisioning of offspring with physiological products occurs in many animals. Within amphibians, maternal provisioning has evolved multiple times, including in South American dendrobatid and Malagasy mantellid poison frogs. In some of these species, mothers feed unfertilized eggs to their developing tadpoles for several months until tadpoles complete metamorphosis. We conducted field studies in Ecuador and Madagascar to ask whether convergence at the behavioral level provides similar benefits to offspring and whether nursing behavior relies on shared neural mechanisms across frogs and vertebrates more broadly. At an ecological level, we found that nursing allows poison frog mothers to provide chemical defenses to their tadpoles in both species. At the level of brain regions, nursing behavior was associated with increased neural activity in the lateral septum and preoptic area in both species, demonstrating recruitment of shared brain regions in the convergent evolution of maternal care within frogs and across vertebrates. In contrast at a molecular level, only mantellids showed increased oxytocin neuron activity akin to that in nursing mammals. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that convergently evolved maternal provisioning behavior provides similar benefits to offspring and relies on similar brain regions. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the convergence in nursing behavior may be different, suggesting evolutionary versatility in the mechanisms promoting maternal behavior.",

    "abstract": "The inherent heterogeneity of the prebiotic milieu is often overlooked when studying nonenzymatic reactions. However, it is important to note that the prebiotic soup of a putative  RNA World would have been replete with a plethora of molecules resulting from complex chemical syntheses, as well as exogeneous delivery. The presence of such background molecules could lead to pertinent phenomenon such as molecular crowding, which can potentially affect how a reaction would advent in a crowded milieu. In the current study, we have analyzed the effect of crowding on the stacking ability of the RNA monomers, using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Our findings corroborate that the purine monomers possess better stacking efficiency than pyrimidine based monomers. Significantly, this competence is further enhanced in the presence of a crowding agent. Interestingly, this enhanced stacking could result in higher sequestration of the purine monomers, putting their ready availability for relevant nonenzymatic polymerization and replication reactions into question. Taken together, this study demonstrates the need for systematic biophysical characterization of molecular crowding in the context of prebiotically pertinent processes. Unravelling such phenomena is essential to gather a real understanding of how the transition from abiotic to biotic, would have happened during the origin of life.",

    "abstract": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted pathogen in the United States, causing 99% of cervical cancers and 5% of all human cancers worldwide. HPV infection requires transport of the viral genome (vDNA) into the nucleus of basal keratinocytes. During this process, minor capsid protein L2 facilitates subcellular retrograde trafficking of the vDNA from endosomes to the Golgi, and accumulation at host chromosomes during mitosis for nuclear retention and localization during interphase. Here we investigated the relationship between cytosolic GSH and HPV16 infection. siRNA knockdown of GSH biosynthetic enzymes results in a partial decrease of HPV16 infection. Likewise, infection of HPV16 in GSH depleted keratinocytes is inefficient, an effect that was not seen with adenoviral vectors. Analysis of trafficking revealed no defects in cellular binding, entry, furin cleavage of L2, or retrograde trafficking of HPV16, but GSH depletion hindered post-Golgi trafficking and translocation, decreasing nuclear accumulation of vDNA. Although precise mechanisms have yet to be defined, this work suggests that GSH is required for a specific post-Golgi trafficking step in HPV16 infection.",

    "abstract": "High throughput Chromosome Conformation Capture experiments have become the standard technique to assess the structure and dynamics of chromosomes in living cells. As any other sufficiently advanced biochemical technique, Hi-C datasets are complex and contain multiple documented biases, with the main ones being the non-uniform read coverage and the decay of contact coverage with genomic distance. Both of these effects have been studied and there are published methods that are able to normalize different Hi-C data to mitigate these biases to some extent. It is crucial that this is done properly, or otherwise the results of any comparative analysis of two or more Hi-C experiments are bound to be biased. In this paper we study both mentioned biases present in the Hi-C data and show that normalization techniques aimed at alleviating the coverage bias are at the same time exacerbating the problems with contact decay bias. We also postulate that it is possible to use generalized linear models to directly compare non-normalized data an that it is giving better results in identification of differential contacts between Hi-C matrices than using the normalized data.",

ER forms a regulatory network in conjunction with other transcription factors, such as FOXA1 and GATA3. GATA3 has been identified as one of the most frequently mutated genes in breast cancer and is capable of specifying chromatin localization of FOXA1 and ER. How GATA3 mutations impact this transcriptional network is unknown. Here we investigate the function of one of the recurrent patient-derived GATA3 mutations (R330fs) on this regulatory network. Genomic analysis indicates that the R330fs mutant can disrupt the cooperative action of ER, FOXA1, and GATA3, and induce a change in chromatin localization of these factors. Relocalization of ER and FOXA1 is associated with altered chromatin architecture, which leads to differential gene expression in GATA3 mutant cells. These results suggest an active role for GATA3 mutants in ER positive breast tumors.",

    "abstract": "Access to large-scale genomics datasets has increased the utility of hypothesis-free genome-wide analyses that result in candidate lists of genes. Often these analyses highlight several gene signals that might contribute to pathogenesis but are insufficiently powered to reach experiment-wide significance. This often triggers a process of laborious evaluation of highly-ranked genes through manual inspection of various public knowledge resources to triage those considered sufficiently interesting for deeper investigation. Here, we introduce a novel multi-dimensional, multi-step machine learning framework to objectively and more holistically assess biological relevance of genes to disease studies, by relying on a plethora of gene-associated annotations. We developed mantis-ml to serve as an automated machine learning (AutoML) framework, following a stochastic semi-supervised learning approach to rank known and novel disease-associated genes through iterative training and prediction sessions of random balanced datasets across the protein-coding exome (n=18,626 genes). We applied this framework on a range of disease-specific areas and as a generic disease likelihood estimator, achieving an average Area Under Curve (AUC) prediction performance of 0.85. Critically, to demonstrate applied utility on exome-wide association studies, we overlapped mantis-ml disease-specific predictions with data from published cohort-level association studies. We retrieved statistically significant enrichment of high mantis-ml predictions among the top-ranked genes from hypothesis-free cohort-level statistics (p<0.05), suggesting the capture of true prioritisation signals. We believe that mantis-ml is a novel easy-to-use tool to support objectively triaging gene discovery and overall enhancing our understanding of complex genotype-phenotype associations.",

We quantified the impact of spatial and environmental factors on bacterial community structure using variation partitioning analysis, illustrating a non-random distribution across the region. pH was confirmed as the key environmental driver structuring Arctic soil bacterial communities, while total organic carbon, moisture and conductivity were shown to have little effect. Specialist taxa were more abundant in acidic and alkaline soils while generalist taxa were more abundant in acidoneutral soils. Of 48,147 bacterial taxa, a core microbiome composed of only 13 taxa that were ubiquitously distributed and present within 95% of samples was identified, illustrating the high potential for endemism in the region.

    "abstract": "During development and wound healing, cells need to form long-ranged ordered structures to ensure precise formation of organs and repair damage. This requires cells to locate specific partner cells to which to adhere. How such cell matching reliably happens is an open problem, particularly in the presence of biological variability. Here, we use an equilibrium energy model to simulate how cell matching can occur with subcellular precision. A single parameter - encapsulating the competition between selective cell adhesion and cell elasticity - can reproduce experimental observations of cell alignment in the Drosophila embryonic heart. This demonstrates that adhesive differences between cells (in the case of the heart, mediated by filopodia interactions) are sufficient to drive cell matching without requiring cell rearrangements. The model can explain observed matching defects in mutant conditions and when there is significant biological variability. We also demonstrate that a dynamic vertex model gives results consistent with the equilibrium energy model. Overall, this work shows that equilibrium energy considerations are consistent with observed cell matching in cardioblasts, and has potential application to other systems, such as neuron connections and wound repair.",

In this paper it is shown that it is possible to make a mathematical model not only of mutations on the genome of species, but of evolution itself, including factors such as artificial and natural selection. It is also presented the algorithm to obtain the probabilities of mutation for each specific part of the genome and for each specie.

    "abstract": "Historically, investigations of how organisms investments in immunity fluctuate in response to environmental and physiological changes have focused on seasonally breeding organisms that confine reproduction to seasons with mild environmental conditions and abundant resources. Consequently, knowledge of how harsh environmental conditions and reproductive effort may interact to shape investment in immunity remains limited. The red crossbill, Loxia curvirostra, is a songbird that can breed on both short, cold and long, warm days if conifer seeds are abundant. This species provides an ideal system to investigate the influence of environmental fluctuations, reproductive investment, and their potential interactions on patterns of immune investment. In this study, we measured inter- and intra-annual immune variation in crossbills across four consecutive summers (2010-2013) and multiple seasons within one year (summer 2011-spring 2012) to explore how physiological and environmental factors impact this immune variation. Overall, the data suggest that immunity varies seasonally, among years, and in response to environmental fluctuations in food resources, precipitation, and temperature, but less in response to physiological measures such as reproduction. Collectively, this system demonstrates that a reproductively flexible organism may breed when conditions allow simultaneous investment in survival-related processes rather than at the expense of them.",

    "abstract": "Hypersaline paleolake sediments are understudied ecosystems whose microbial ecology is largely unknown. Here we present mineralogical, geochemical, and small-subunit 16S rRNA gene sequence data on one such environment, the Pilot Valley Basin (PVB), a sub-basin of ancient Lake Bonneville located in northwest Utah. PVB exhibits a variety of aqueous minerals including phyllosilicates, carbonates, and sulfates, as well as microbially-induced sedimentary structures. As perchlorate occurs naturally (up to 6.5 ppb) in Pilot Valley sediments, and because recent evidence suggests that it is subject to biotic reduction, PVB has been proposed as a Mars analog site for astrobiological studies. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to investigate microbial diversity and community structure along horizontal and vertical transects within the upper basin sediments and beta diversity analyses indicate that the microbial communities in Pilot Valley are structured into three discrete groups. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belonging to the main archaeal phylum, Euryarchaeota, make up ~23% of the sequences, while OTUs belonging to three bacterial phyla, Proteobacteria, Bacteroides and Gemmatimonadetes, constitute ~60-70% of the sequences recovered at all sites. Diversity analyses indicate that the specific composition of each community correlates with sediment grain size, and with biogeochemical parameters such as nitrate and sulfate concentrations. Interestingly, OTUs belonging to the phylum Gemmatimonadetes are co-located with extreme halophilic archaeal and bacterial taxa, which suggests a potential new attribute, halophilicity, of this newly-recognized phylum. Altogether, results of this first comprehensive geomicrobial study of Pilot Valley reveal that basin sediments harbor a complex and diverse ecosystem.",

Some Lepidoptera display transparent patches combined with already cryptic opaque patches. While transparency has recently been shown to reduce detectability in conspicuous prey, we here test whether transparency decreases detectability in already cryptically-coloured terrestrial prey, by conducting field predation experiments with free avian predators and artificial moths. We monitored and compared survival of a fully opaque grey artificial form (cryptic), a form including transparent windows and a wingless artificial butterfly body. Survival of the transparent forms was similar to that of wingless bodies and higher than that of fully opaque forms, suggesting a reduction of detectability conferred by transparency. This is the first evidence that transparency decreases detectability in cryptic terrestrial prey. Future studies should explore the organisation of transparent and opaque patches on the animal body and their interplay on survival, as well as the costs and other potential benefits associated to transparency on land.",

    "abstract": "Kinship coefficients and FST, which measure genetic relatedness and the overall population structure, respectively, have important biomedical applications. However, existing estimators are only accurate under restrictive conditions that most natural population structures do not satisfy. We recently derived new kinship and FST estimators for arbitrary population structures [1, 2]. Our estimates on human datasets reveal a complex population structure driven by founder effects due to dispersal from Africa and admixture. Notably, our new approach estimates larger FST values of 26% for native worldwide human populations and 23% for admixed Hispanic individuals, whereas the existing approach estimates 9.8% and 2.6%, respectively. While previous work correctly measured FST between subpopulation pairs, our generalized FST measures genetic distances among all individuals and their most recent common ancestor (MRCA) population, revealing that genetic differentiation is greater than previously appreciated. This analysis demonstrates that estimating kinship and FST under more realistic assumptions is important for modern population genetic analysis.",

    "abstract": "Human visual surface perception has neural correlates in early visual cortex, but the extent to which feedback contributes to this activity is not well known. Feedback projections preferentially enter superficial and deep anatomical layers, while avoiding the middle layer, which provides a hypothesis for the cortical depth distribution of fMRI activity related to feedback in early visual cortex. Here, we presented human participants uniform surfaces on a dark, textured background. The grey surface in the left hemifield was either perceived as static or moving based on a manipulation in the right hemifield. Physically, the surface was identical in the left visual hemifield, so any difference in percept likely was related to feedback. Using ultra-high field fMRI, we report the first evidence for a depth distribution of activation in line with feedback during the (illusory) perception of surface motion. Our results fit with a signal re-entering in superficial depths of V1, followed by a feedforward sweep of the re-entered information through V2 and V3, as suggested by activity centred in the middle-depth levels of the latter areas. This positive modulation of the BOLD signal due to illusory surface motion was on top of a strong negative BOLD response in the cortical representation of the surface stimuli, which depended on the presence of texture in the background. Hence, the magnitude and sign of the BOLD response to the surface strongly depended on background properties, and was additionally modulated by the presence or absence of illusory motion perception in a manner compatible with feedback. In summary, the present study demonstrates the potential of depth resolved fMRI in tackling biomechanical questions on perception that so far were only within reach of invasive animal experimentation.",

    "abstract": "Somatic mutations are early drivers of tumorigenesis and tumor progression. However, the mutations typically occur at variable positions across different individuals, resulting in the data being too sparse to test meaningful associations between variants and phenotypes. To overcome this challenge, we devised a novel approach called Gene-to-Protein-to-Disease (GPD) which accumulates variants into new sequence units as the degree of genetic assault on structural or functional units of each protein. The variant frequencies in the sequence units were highly reproducible between two large cancer cohorts. Survival analysis identified 247 sequence units in which somatic mutations had deleterious effects on overall survival, including consensus driver mutations obtained from multiple calling algorithms. By contrast, around 75% of the survival predictive units had been undetected by conventional gene-level analysis. We demonstrate the ability of these signatures to separate patient groups according to overall survival, therefore providing novel prognostic tools for various cancers.

    "abstract": "Timely sister chromatid separation, promoted by separase, is essential for faithful chromosome segregation. Separase is a member of the CD clan of cysteine proteases, which also includes the pro-apoptotic enzymes known as caspases. We report that the C. elegans separase SEP-1, primarily known for its role in cell division, is required for apoptosis when the predominant pro-apoptotic caspase CED-3 is compromised. Loss of SEP-1 results in extra surviving cells in a weak ced-3(-) mutant, and suppresses the embryonic lethality of a mutant defective for the apoptotic suppressor ced-9/Bcl-2. We also report apparent non-apoptotic roles for CED-3 in promoting germ cell proliferation and germline meiotic chromosome disjunction and the normal rate of embryonic development. Moreover, loss of the soma-specific (CSP-3) and germline-specific (CSP-2) caspase inhibitors results in CED-3-dependent suppression of embryonic lethality and meiotic chromosome non-disjunction respectively, when separase function is compromised. Thus, while caspases and separases have evolved different substrate specificities associated with their specialized functions in apoptosis and cell division respectively, they appear to have retained the residual ability to participate in both processes, supporting the view that co-option of components in cell division may have led to the innovation of programmed cell suicide early in metazoan evolution.",

    "abstract": "Myelin is a specialized membrane produced by oligodendrocytes that insulates and supports axons. Oligodendrocytes extend numerous cellular processes, as projections of the plasma membrane, and simultaneously wrap multiple layers of myelin membrane around target axons. Notably, myelin sheaths originating from the same oligodendrocyte are variable in size, suggesting local mechanisms regulate myelin sheath growth. Purified myelin contains ribosomes and hundreds of mRNAs, supporting a model that mRNA localization and local protein synthesis regulate sheath growth and maturation. However, the mechanisms by which mRNAs are selectively enriched in myelin sheaths are unclear. To investigate how mRNAs are targeted to myelin sheaths, we tested the hypothesis that transcripts are selected for myelin enrichment through consensus sequences in the 3 untranslated region (3 UTR). Using methods to visualize mRNA in living zebrafish larvae, we identified candidate 3 UTRs that were sufficient to localize mRNA to sheaths and enriched near growth zones of nascent membrane. We bioinformatically identified motifs common in 3 UTRs from three myelin-enriched transcripts and determined that these motifs are required for mRNA transport to myelin sheaths. Finally, we show that one motif is highly enriched in the myelin transcriptome, suggesting that this sequence is a global regulator of mRNA localization during developmental myelination.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAdvances in sequencing technologies have led to the release of reference genomes and annotations for multiple individuals within more well-studied systems. While each of these new genome assemblies shares significant portions of synteny between each other, the annotated structure of gene models within these regions can differ. Of particular concern are split-gene misannotations, in which a single gene is incorrectly annotated as two distinct genes or two genes are incorrectly annotated as a single gene. These misannotations can have major impacts on functional prediction, estimates of expression, and many downstream analyses.\\n\\nResultsWe developed a high-throughput method based on pairwise comparisons of annotations that detect potential split-gene misannotations and quantifies support for whether the genes should be merged into a single gene model. We demonstrate the utility of our method using gene annotations of three reference genomes from maize (B73, PH207, and W22), a difficult system from an annotation perspective due to the size and complexity of the genome. On average, we find several hundred of these potential split-gene misannotations in each pairwise comparison, corresponding to 3-5% of gene models across annotations. To determine which state (i.e. one gene or multiple genes) is biologically supported, we utilize RNAseq data from 10 tissues throughout development along with a novel metric and simulation framework. The methods we have developed require minimal human interaction and can be applied to future assemblies to aid in annotation efforts.\\n\\nConclusionsSplit-gene misannotations occur at appreciable frequency in maize annotations. We have developed a method to easily identify and correct these misannotations. Importantly, this method is generic in that it can utilize any type of short-read expression data. Failure to account for split-gene misannotations has serious consequences for biological inference, particularly for expression-based analyses.",

    "abstract": "Reproducible identification of white matter tracts across subjects is essential for the study of structural connectivity of the human brain. The key challenges are anatomical differences between subjects and human rater subjectivity in labeling. Labeling white matter regions of interest presents many challenges due to the need to integrate both local and global information. Clearly communicating the human/manual processes to capture this information is cumbersome, yet essential to lay a solid foundation for comprehensive atlases. The state-of-the-art for white matter atlas is the single population-averaged Johns Hopkins Eve atlas. A critical bottleneck with the Eve atlas framework is that manual labeling time is extensive and peripheral white matter regions are conservatively labeled. In this work, we developed protocols that will facilitate manual virtual dissection of white matter pathways, with the goals to be anatomically accurate, intuitive, reproducible, and act as an initial stage to build an amenable knowledge base of neuroanatomical regions. We analyzed reproducibility of the fiber bundles and variability of human raters using DICE correlation coefficient, intraclass correlation coefficient, and root mean squared error. The protocols at their initial stage have shown promising results on both typical 3T research acquisition Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging and high-acquisition quality Human Connectome Project datasets. The TractEM manual labeling protocols allow for reconstruction of reproducible subject-specific fiber bundles across the brain. The protocols and sample results have been made available in open source to improve generalizability and reliability in collaboration.",

Describing variation in repeat content among individuals and between populations is key to elucidating the evolutionary significance of repetitive DNA. However, the cost of producing references genomes has limited large-scale intraspecific comparisons to a handful of model organisms where multiple reference genomes are available.\\n\\nResultsWe examine repeat content variation in the genomes of 94 elite inbred maize lines using graph-based repeat clustering, a reference-free and rapid assay of repeat content. We examine population structure using genome-wide repeat profiles and demonstrate the stiff-stalk and non-stiff-stalk heterotic populations are homogenous with regard to global repeat content. In contrast and similar to previously reported results, the same individuals show clear differentiation, and aggregate into two populations, when examining population structure using genome-wide SNPs. Additionally, we develop a novel kmer based technique to examine the chromosomal distribution of repeat clusters in silico and show a cluster dependent statistically significant association with gene density.\\n\\nConclusionOur results indicate that repeat content variation in the heterotic populations of maize has not diverged and is uncoupled from population stratification at SNP loci. We also show that repeat families exhibit divergent patterns with regard to chromosomal distribution, some repeat clusters accumulate in regions of high gene density, whereas others aggregate in regions of low gene density.\\n\\nAuthors contributionsSRB and AB conceived the study, SRB performed the bioinformatic analysis, SRB wrote the paper with input from AB. email contacts: Simon Renny-Byfield: simon.renny-byfield@corteva.com, Andy Baumgarten: andy.baumgarten@corteva.com",

In this work we introduce COMET, a computational framework for the identification of candidate marker panels consisting of one or more genes for cell populations of interest identified with single-cell RNA-seq data. We show that COMET outperforms other methods for the identification of single-gene panels, and enables, for the first time, prediction of multi-gene marker panels ranked by relevance. Staining by flow-cytometry assay confirmed the accuracy of COMETs predictions in identifying marker-panels for cellular subtypes, at both the single- and multi-gene levels, validating COMETs applicability and accuracy in predicting favorable marker-panels from transcriptomic input. COMET is a general non-parametric statistical framework and can be used as-is on various high-throughput datasets in addition to single-cell RNA-sequencing data. COMET is available for use via a web interface (http://www.cometsc.com) or a standalone software package (https://github.com/MSingerlab/COMETSC).",

We hypothesized that word processing is driven by a visual representation that is compositional i.e. with string responses systematically related to letters. To test this hypothesis, we devised a model in which neurons tuned to letter shape respond to longer strings by linearly summing letter responses. This letter model explained human performance in both visual search as well as word reading tasks. Brain imaging revealed that viewing a string activates this compositional letter code in the lateral occipital (LO) region, and that subsequent comparisons to known words are computed by the visual word form area (VWFA). Thus, seeing a word activates a compositional letter code that enables efficient reading.",

To answer this, we let observers search for two colored targets among distractors. Crucially, we independently varied the number of target colors that observers anticipated, and the number of target colors actually used to distinguish the targets in the display. This enabled us to dissociate the preparation of selection mechanisms from the actual engagement of such mechanisms. Multivariate classification of electroencephalographic activity allowed us to track selection of each target separately across time. The results revealed only small neural and behavioral costs associated with preparing for selecting two objects, but substantial costs when engaging in selection. Further analyses suggest this cost is the consequence of neural competition resulting in limited parallel processing, rather than a serial bottleneck.

Much of our understanding of the tumor microenvironment comes from in vitro studies isolating the interactions between malignant cells and a single stromal cell type, often along a single pathway. To develop a deeper understanding of the interactions between cells within human lung tumors we performed RNA-seq profiling of flow-sorted malignant cells, endothelial cells, immune cells, fibroblasts, and bulk cells from freshly resected human primary non-small-cell lung tumors. We mapped the cell-specific differential expression of prognostically-associated secreted factors and cell surface genes, and computationally reconstructed cross-talk between these cell types to generate a novel resource we call the Lung Tumor Microenvironment Interactome (LTMI). Using this resource, we identified and validated a prognostically unfavorable influence of Gremlin-1 production by fibroblasts on proliferation of malignant lung adenocarcinoma cells. We also found a prognostically favorable association between infiltration of mast cells and less aggressive tumor cell behavior. These results illustrate the utility of the LTMI as a resource for generating hypotheses concerning tumor-microenvironment interactions that may have prognostic and therapeutic relevance.\\n\\nSummaryRNA-seq profiling of sorted populations from primary lung cancer samples identifies prognostically relevant cross-talk between cell types in the tumor microenvironment.",

    "abstract": "Sex chromosomes and sex determining genes can evolve fast, with the sex-linked chromosomes often differing between closely related species. A substantial body of population genetics theory has been developed and tested to explain the rapid evolution of sex chromosomes and sex determination. However, we do not know why the sex-linked chromosomes differ between some species pairs yet are relatively conserved in other taxa. Addressing this question will require comparing closely related taxa with conserved and divergent sex chromosomes and sex determination systems to identify biological features that could explain these rate differences. Cytological karyotypes suggest that muscid flies (e.g., house fly) and blow flies are such a taxonomic pair. The sex chromosomes appear to differ across muscid species, whereas they are highly conserved across blow flies. Despite the cytological evidence, we do not know the extent to which muscid sex chromosomes are independently derived along different evolutionary lineages. To address that question, we used genomic data to identify young sex chromosomes in two closely related muscid species, horn fly (Haematobia irritans) and stable fly (Stomoxys calcitrans). We provide evidence that the nascent sex chromosomes of horn fly and stable fly were derived independently from each other and from the young sex chromosomes of the closely related house fly (Musca domestica). We present three different scenarios that could have given rise to the sex chromosomes of horn fly and stable fly, and we describe how the scenarios could be distinguished. Distinguishing between these scenarios in future work could help to identify features of muscid genomes that promote sex chromosome divergence.",

    "abstract": "It has been suggested the subjective sense of certainty, or confidence, in ambiguous sensory cues can alter the interpretation of reward feedback and facilitate learning. We trained rats to report the orientation of ambiguous visual stimuli according to a spatial stimulus-response rule. Following choice, rats could wait a self-timed delay for reward or initiate a new trial. Waiting times increased with discrimination accuracy, demonstrating that this measure could be used as a proxy for confidence. Chemogenetic silencing of BLA shortened waiting times overall whereas ACC inhibition rendered waiting times insensitive to confidence-modulating attributes of visual stimuli, suggesting contribution of ACC but not BLA to confidence computations. Subsequent reversal learning was enhanced by confidence. Both ACC and BLA inhibition blocked this enhancement but via differential modulation of learning strategies and consistency in using learned rules. Altogether, we demonstrate dissociable roles for ACC and BLA in transmitting confidence and learning under uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDespite recent decreases in the cost of sequencing, shotgun metagenome sequencing remains more expensive compared with 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Methods have been developed to predict the functional profiles of microbial communities based on their taxonomic composition, and PICRUSt is the most widely used of these techniques. In this study, we evaluated the performance of PICRUSt by comparing the significance of the differential abundance of functional gene profiles predicted with PICRUSt to those from shotgun metagenome sequencing across different environments.\\n\\nResultsWe selected 7 datasets of human, non-human animal and environmental (soil) samples that have publicly available 16S rRNA and shotgun metagenome sequences. As we would expect based on previous literature, strong Spearman correlations were observed between gene compositions predicted with PICRUSt and measured with shotgun metagenome sequencing. However, these strong correlations were preserved even when the sample labels were shuffled. This suggests that simple correlation coefficient is a highly unreliable measure for the performance of algorithms like PICRUSt. As an alternative, we compared the performance of PICRUSt predicted genes to metagenome genes in inference models associated with metadata within each dataset. With this method, we found reasonable performance for human datasets, with PICRUSt performing better for inference on genes related to \\\"house-keeping\\\" functions. However, the performance of PICRUSt degraded sharply outside of human datasets when used for inference.\\n\\nConclusionWe conclude that the utility of PICRUSt for inference with the default database is likely limited outside of human samples and that development of tools for gene prediction specific to different non-human and environmental samples is warranted.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOptical mapping of transmembrane voltage and intracellular calcium is a powerful tool for investigating cardiac physiology and pathophysiology. However, simultaneous dual mapping of two fluorescent probes remains technically challenging. We introduce a novel, easy-to-use approach that requires a path splitter, single camera and excitation light to simultaneously acquire voltage and calcium signals from whole heart preparations, which can be applied to other physiological models - including neurons and isolated cardiomyocytes.\\n\\nResultsComplementary probes were selected that could be excited with a single wavelength light source. Langendorff-perfused hearts (rat, swine) were stained and imaged using a sCMOS camera outfitted with an optical path splitter to simultaneously acquire two emission fields at high spatial and temporal resolution. Voltage (RH237) and calcium (Rhod2) signals were acquired concurrently on a single sensor, resulting in two 384x256 images at 814 frames per second. At this frame rate, the signal-to-noise ratio was 47 (RH237) and 85 (Rhod2). Imaging experiments were performed on small rodent hearts, as well as larger pig hearts with sufficient optical signals. In separate experiments, each dye was used independently to assess crosstalk and demonstrate signal specificity. Additionally, the effect of ryanodine on myocardial calcium transients was validated - with no measurable effect on the amplitude of optical action potentials. To demonstrate spatial resolution, ventricular tachycardia was induced -resulting in the novel finding that spatially discordant calcium alternans can be present in different regions of the heart, even when electrical alternans remain concordant. The described system excels in providing a wide field of view and high spatiotemporal resolution for a variety of cardiac preparations.\\n\\nConclusionsWe report the first multiparametric mapping system that simultaneously acquires calcium and voltage signals from cardiac preparations, using a path splitter, single camera and excitation light. This approach eliminates the need for multiple cameras, excitation light patterning or frame interleaving. These features can aid in the adoption of dual mapping technology by the broader cardiovascular research community, and decrease the barrier of entry into panoramic heart imaging, as it reduces the number of required cameras.",

This study addressed both limitations using the largest panel of HPV+ HNSCC patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and organoids described to date. Whole exome profiles of the PDXs were compared to those of HPV+ human tumors and cell lines, and genetic features of the models were analyzed relative to their growth properties and outcomes of their patients of origin. PDX engraftment enriched for negatively prognostic NOTCH1 mutations while preserving multiple features lost in existing cell lines, including PIK3CA mutations, TRAF3 deletion, and absence of EGFR amplification. Observation of more mutations in faster-growing models facilitated identification of an association between mutational burden and local progression in both HPV+ and HPV-HNSCCs. Reduced E7 and p16INK4A levels found in a PDX from a lethal case led to detection of a similar profile among recurrent HPV+ HNSCCs in two patient cohorts, where low E2F target gene expression downstream of E7 predicted recurrence and mortality. Our findings bridge a critical gap in preclinical models for HPV+ HNSCCs and simultaneously reveal novel applications for mutational burden and E2F target dysregulation in biomarker development.",

    "abstract": "While inter-subject correlation (ISC) analysis is a powerful tool for naturalistic scanning data, drawing appropriate statistical inferences is difficult due to the daunting task of accounting for the intricate relatedness in data structure as well as the intricacy of handling the multiple testing issue. In our previous work we proposed nonparametric approaches to performing group ISC analysis through bootstrapping for one group of subjects and permutation testing for two groups (Chen et al., 2016). A more flexible methodology is to parametrically build a linear mixed-effects (LME) model that captures the relatedness embedded in the data (Chen et al., 2017); in addition, the LME approach also has the capability of incorporating explanatory variables such as subject-grouping factors and quantitative covariates. However, the whole-brain LME modeling methodology still faces some challenges. When an LME model becomes sophisticated, it becomes difficult or even impossible to assign accurate degrees of freedom for each testing statistic. In addition, the typical correction methods for multiple testing through spatial extent tend to be over-penalizing, and dichotomous decisions through thresholding under null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) are controversial in general and equally problematic in neuroimaging as well. For instance, the popular practice of only reporting \\\"statistically significant\\\" results in neuroimaging not only wastes data information, but also distorts the full results as well as perpetuates the reproducibility crisis because of the fact that the difference between a \\\"significant\\\" result and a \\\"non-significant\\\" one is not necessarily significant.\\n\\nHere we propose a Bayesian multilevel (BML) framework for ISC data analysis that integrates all the spatial elements (i.e., regions of interest) into one model. By loosely constraining the regions through a weakly informative prior, BML conservatively pools the effect of each region toward the center, and improves collective fitting and overall model performance. The BML paradigm leverages the commonality or similarity among brain regions and the information across multiple levels embedded in the hierarchical data structure instead of leveraging the spatial extent adopted in the conventional correction method for multiple testing. In addition to potentially achieving a higher inference efficiency than the conventional LME approach, BML improves spatial specificity and easily allows the investigator to adopt a philosophy of full results reporting (instead of dichotomizing into \\\"significant\\\" and \\\"non-significant\\\" results), thus minimizing loss of information while enhancing reproducibility. A dataset of naturalistic scanning is utilized to illustrate the modeling approach with 268 parcels and to showcase the modeling capability, flexibility and advantages in reports reporting. The associated program will be available as part of the AFNI suite for general use.",

    "abstract": "Human cystatin C (HCC), a cysteine-protease inhibitor, exists as a folded monomer under physiological conditions but has the ability to self-assemble via domain swapping into multimeric states, including oligomers with a doughnut-like structure. The structure of the monomeric HCC has been solved by X-ray crystallography, and a covalently linked version of HCC (stab-1 HCC) is able to form stable oligomeric species containing 10-12 monomeric subunits. We have performed molecular modeling, and in conjunction with experimental parameters obtained from AFM, TEM and SAXS measurements, we observe that the structures are essentially flat, with a height of about 2 nm, and the distance between the outer edge of the ring and the edge of the central cavity is ~5.1 nm. These dimensions correspond to the height and diameter of one stab-1 HCC subunit and we present a dodecamer model for stabilized cystatin C oligomers using molecular dynamics simulations and experimentally measured parameters. Given that oligomeric species in protein aggregation reactions are often transient and very highly heterogeneous, the structural information presented here on these isolated stab-1 HCC oligomers may provide useful to further explore the physiological relevance of different structural species of cystatin C in relationship to protein misfolding disease",

Whether and how HCV regulates miR-122 maturation to create an environment favorable to its replication remains unexplored. We discovered that Akt-dependent phosphorylation of KSRP host protein at Serine residue 193 is essential for miR-122 maturation in hepatocytes. Moreover, we showed the existence of a reciprocal regulation loop where HCV replication can modulate the proviral effect mediated by KSRP-dependent maturation of miR-122.

    "abstract": "The dysbiosis of gut microbiota has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs); however, the underlying mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. Heavily glycosylated mucin not only establishes a first-line barrier against pathogens, but also serves as a niche for microbial growth. We hypothesized that dysbiosis may cause abnormal mucin utilization and microbial metabolic dysfunction. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and mucin components in the stool samples of 40 healthy subjects, 49 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, and 44 Crohns disease (CD) patients from Japan. The levels of n-butyrate were significantly lower in the stools of both the CD and UC patients than in those of the healthy subjects. Correlation analysis identified 7 bacterial species positively correlated with n-butyrate levels, among which the major n-butyrate producer, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, was particularly underrepresented in CD patients, but not in UC patients. In UC patients, there were inverse correlations between mucin O-glycan levels and the production of SCFAs, such as n-butyrate, suggesting that mucin O-glycans act as an endogenous fermentation substrate for n-butyrate production. Indeed, mucin-fed rodents exhibited enhanced n-butyrate production, leading to the expansion of RORgt+Treg cells and IgA-producing cells in the colonic lamina propria. Importantly, the availability of mucin-associated O-glycans to the microbiota was significantly reduced in n-butyrate-deficient UC patients. Taken together, our findings highlight the biological significance of the symbiosynthesis pathway in the production of n-butyrate, which maintains gut immune homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Vesicular glutamate transporter type 2 (VGLUT2) is known to play an important role in mediating the heat hyperalgesia induced by inflammation. However, the underlying mechanism for this activity is poorly understood. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), serving as a key regulator in mediating release of glutamate, contributed to the inflammatory heat. It remains unknown whether there is a bridge between Cdk5 and VGLUT2 for mediating inflammatory pain. Therefore, we designed the experiment to determine whether VGLUT2 signaling pathway is involved in Inflammatory pain mediated by Cdk5 and the heat hyperalgesia induced by complete Freunds adjuvant (CFA) can be reversed by roscovitine, a selective inhibitor for Cdk5 through inhibition of VGLUT2 expression. Immunohistochemistry results suggest that when compared with rats in a control group, rats in an experimental group showed significant coexpression of Cdk5/VGLUT2 in small and medium-sized neuronal cells of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and spinal cord between days 1 and 3 following subcutaneous injection of CFA. Moreover, our study revealed that the expression of VGLUT2 protein in DRG and spinal cord was remarkably increased between days 1 and 3 following CFA injection. Additionally, p25 but not p35, a activator of Cdk5, protein was significantly increased and reduced by roscovitine. The increased expressions of VGLUT2 protein was significantly reduced by roscovitine as well. Our study showed that VGLUT2/Cdk5 signaling pathway contributed to the inflammatory pain medicated by Cdk5/p25.",

    "abstract": "The deep-slope demersal fishery that targets snapper and grouper species is an important fishery in Indonesia. Boats operate at depths between 50-500 m using drop lines and bottom long lines. There are few data, however, on the basic characteristics of the fishery which impedes accurate stock assessments and the establishment of harvest control rules. To address this gap, we developed a collaborative data collection and recording system for species and length composition of commercial catches. The Crew-Operated Data Recording System (CODRS) involves fishers who take photos of each individual fish in the catch along with a low-cost vessel tracking system. As it relies on fishers collaboration and willingness to share data, CODRS is comparable with a logbook system but enables verification of species identification with greater spatial resolution. We implemented this system from 2015 to 2018 and gathered data from 251 captains and 2,707 fishing trips, which yielded more than one million individual fish, or 2,680 tons. While there were over 100 species in the fishery, we found that the top five species accounted for approximately half of the total catch. We also unveiled fifteen species previously not associated with the fishery due to the fish being eaten on-board, used as bait, or sold prior to being recorded by traders. Using these data, we updated life-history parameters (length at maturity, optimum fishing length, asymptotic length, and maximum length) of the top 50 species in the fishery based on the maximum observed length; this study resulted in higher estimates for maximum length, most likely due to the high sampling size. For some species, the discrepancies between different sources were large, whereas others were not. This collaborative data collection method and findings are useful for scientists and managers interested in conducting length-based stock assessments to establish harvest control rules for data-poor fisheries.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveA low-normal albumin level is associated with a high risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality in the general population. However, the relationship between serum albumin level and future decline of kidney function is unclear. We aimed to clarify the effect of serum albumin level on the decline of kidney function in the general population.\\n\\nMethodsThe data used were from 11,000 participants of a voluntary health checkup program between 1998 and 2006 conducted in Japan. The primary outcome for kidney function was a difference in estimated glomerular filtration rate ({Delta}eGFR) of [&ge;]3 mL/min/1.73 m2/year. The association of the risk of decreased kidney function with albumin level was determined using a logistic regression analysis. We fit separate multivariable logistic regressions for serum albumin levels (g/dL) as a continuous variable and as categorical data, classified as [&le;]4.3 (n=2,530), 4.4- 4.6 (n=5,427), and [&ge;]4.7 (n=3,043).\\n\\nResultsOf 11,000 participants, 346 had a {Delta}eGFR/year of [&ge;]3. As compared with the participants with albumin levels of [&ge;]4.7 g/dL, the risk of decline in kidney function was higher not only in those with albumin levels of [&le;]4.3 g/dL (adjusted OR = 2,29, 95% CI: 1.65-3.18) but also in 4.4-4.6 g/dL (adjusted OR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.20-2.14).\\n\\nConclusionDecreased albumin level is an independent risk factor for rapid decline in kidney function even within the normal range.",

    "abstract": "The study of the acquisition of antibiotic resistance (AR) has mainly focused in inherited processes, namely mutations and acquisition of AR genes. However, inducible, non-inheritable AR has received less attention and most information in this field derives from the study of antibiotics as inducers of their associated resistance mechanisms. Less is known about non-antibiotic compounds or situations that can induce AR during infection. Multidrug resistance efflux pumps are a category of AR determinants characterized by the tightly regulation of their expression. Their contribution to acquired AR relies in their overexpression. Herein we analyzed potential inducers of the expression of the chromosomally-encoded Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinically-relevant efflux pumps, MexCD-OprJ and MexAB-OprM. For this purpose, we developed a set of luxCDABE-based P. aeruginosa biosensor strains, which allows the high-throughput analysis of compounds able of modifying the expression of these efflux pumps. Using these strains, we analyzed a set of 240 compounds present in Biolog Phenotype Microarrays. Several inducers of the expression of the genes that encode these efflux pumps were found. The study focused in dequalinium chloride, procaine and atropine, compounds that can be found in clinical settings. Using real-time PCR, we confirmed that these compounds indeed induce the expression of mexCD-oprJ. In addition, P. aeruginosa presents lower susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (a MexCD-OprJ substrate) when dequalinium chloride, procaine or atropine are present. This work emphasizes the need of studying compounds that can trigger transient AR during antibiotic treatment, a phenotype difficult to discover using classical susceptibility tests.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSmall SH2/SH3 adapter proteins regulate cell fate and behavior by mediating interactions between cell surface receptors and downstream signaling effectors in many signal transduction pathways. The Crk family has tissue-specific roles in phagocytosis, cell migration and neuronal development, and mediates oncogenic signaling in pathways like that of Abelson kinase. However, redundancy among the two mammalian family members and the position of the Drosophila gene on the fourth chromosome precluded assessment of Crks full role in embryogenesis. We circumvented these limitations with shRNA and CRISPR technology to assess Crks function in Drosophila morphogenesis. We found Crk is essential beginning in the first few hours of development, where it ensures accurate mitosis by regulating orchestrated dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton to keep mitotic spindles in syncytial embryos from colliding. In this role, it positively regulates levels of the Arp2/3 complex, its regulator SCAR, and F-actin in actin caps and pseudocleavage furrows. Crk loss leads to loss of nuclei and formation of multinucleate cells. We also found roles for Crk in embryonic wound healing and in axon patterning in the nervous system, where it localizes to the axons and midline glia. Thus, Crk regulates diverse events in embryogenesis that require orchestrated cytoskeletal dynamics.",

    "abstract": "The pluripotent epiblast gives rise to all tissues and organs in an adult body. Its differentiation starts at gastrulation when the epiblast generates mesoderm and endoderm germ layers through a process called epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Although gastrulation EMT coincides with loss of epiblast pluripotency, pluripotent cells in development and in vitro can adopt either mesenchymal or epithelial morphology. The relationship between epiblasts cellular morphology and its pluripotency is not well understood. In this work, using chicken epiblast and mammalian pluripotency stem cell (PSC) models, we show that PSCs undergo a mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) prior to EMT-associated pluripotency loss. Epiblast MET and its subsequent EMT are two distinct processes. The former, a partial MET, is associated with reversible initiation of pluripotency exit; whereas the latter, a full EMT, is associated with complete and irreversible pluripotency loss. We provide evidence that integrin-mediated cell-matrix interaction is a key player in pluripotency exit regulation. We propose that epiblast partial MET is an evolutionarily conserved process among all amniotic vertebrates and its developmental function is to mediate planar symmetry-breaking within an epithelialized epiblast, taking place after epiblast MET but before gastrulation EMT.",

    "abstract": "Wiring a complex brain requires enormous cell specificity. This specificity is laid out via a developmental process where neural stem cells produce countless diverse neurons. To help elucidate this process and resolve the considerable dynamic specificity, we need to observe the development of multiple neuronal lineages. Drosophila central brain lineages are predetermined, comprised of a fixed set of neurons born in pairs in a specific order. To reveal specific roles of lineage identity, Notch-dependent sister fate specification, and temporal patterning in morphological diversification, we mapped approximately one quarter of the Drosophila central brain lineages. While we found large aggregate differences, we also discovered similar patterns of morphological specification and diversification. Lineage identity plus Notch state govern primary neuronal trajectories, whereas temporal fates diversify terminal elaborations in target-specific manners. In addition, we identified  related lineages of analogous neuron types produced in similar temporal patterns. Two stem cells even yield identical series of dopaminergic neuron types, but with completely disparate sister neurons. These phenomena suggest that large changes in morphological diversity can be the consequence of relatively small differences in lineage fating. Taken together, this large-scale lineage mapping study reveals that relatively simple rules drive incredible neuronal complexity.",
