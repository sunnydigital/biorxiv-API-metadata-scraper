    "abstract": "The mechanisms of metabolism comprise a large number of biochemical pathways with a myriad of poorly characterised genetic influences. In this study, we perform a systematic integration of chromatin interaction (Hi-C), expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), gene ontology, drug interaction, and literature-supported connections to deconvolute the genetic regulatory influences of 145 blood metabolite-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We identify 577 genes that are regulated via chromatin looping to 130 distal and proximal SNPs across 48 different human tissues. The affected genes are enriched in categories that include metabolism, enzymes, plasma proteins, disease development, and potential drug targets. These novel SNP-gene-metabolite associations are a valuable resource for understanding the molecular mechanisms guiding pathologic metabolite levels in human tissues, and for further investigation into disease diagnosis and therapy.",

    "abstract": "Taurine is one of the most abundant free amino acids in the brain. It is well known that taurine protects the brain from further damage after a traumatic event. However, only a few ex vivo studies have looked at the possible role of taurine in the regulation of axon regeneration after injury. Here, we aimed to reveal the possible role for taurine in the modulation of axonal regeneration following a complete spinal cord injury (SCI) using lampreys as an animal model. The brainstem of lampreys contains several individually identifiable descending neurons that differ greatly in their capacity for axonal regeneration after SCI. This offers a convenient model to promote or inhibit axonal regrowth in the same in vivo preparation. First, we carried out high performance liquid chromatography experiments to measure taurine levels in the spinal cord following SCI. Our results revealed a statistically significant increase in taurine levels 4 weeks post lesion, which suggested that taurine might have a positive effect on axonal regrowth. Based on these results, we decided to apply an acute taurine treatment at the site of injury to study its effect on axon regeneration. Results from these experiments show that an acute taurine treatment enhances axonal regeneration following SCI in lampreys. This offers a novel way to try to promote axon regeneration after nervous system injuries in mammalian models.",

    "abstract": "Resistance to systemic drug therapies is a major reason for the failure of anti-cancer therapies. Here, we tested doxorubicin-loaded human serum albumin (HSA) nanoparticles in the neuroblastoma cell line UKF-NB-3 and its ABCB1-expressing sublines adapted to vincristine (UKF-NB-3rVCR1) and doxorubicin (UKF-NB-3rDOX20). Doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles displayed increased anti-cancer activity in UKF-NB-3rVCR1 and UKF-NB-3rDOX20 cells relative to doxorubicin solution, but not in UKF-NB-3 cells. UKF-NB-3rVCR1 cells were resensitised by nanoparticle-encapsulated doxorubicin to the level of UKF-NB-3 cells. UKF-NB-3rDOX20 cells displayed a more pronounced resistance phenotype than UKF-NB-3rVCR1 cells and were not re-sensitised by doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles to the level of parental cells. ABCB1 inhibition using zosuquidar resulted in similar effects like nanoparticle incorporation, indicating that doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles circumvent ABCB1-mediated drug efflux. The limited re-sensitisation of UKF-NB-3rDOX20 cells to doxorubicin by circumvention of ABCB1-mediated efflux is probably due to the presence of multiple doxorubicin resistance mechanisms. So far, ABCB1 inhibitors have failed in clinical trials, probably because systemic ABCB1 inhibition results in a modified body distribution of its many substrates including drugs, xenobiotics, and other molecules. HSA nanoparticles may provide an alternative, more specific way to overcome transporter-mediated resistance.",

    "abstract": "Plant synthetic biology aims to contribute to global food security by engineering plants with new or improved functionalities. In recent years, synthetic biology has rapidly advanced from the setup of basic genetic devices to the design of increasingly complex gene circuits able to provide organisms with novel functions. While many bacterial, fungal and mammalian unicellular chassis have been extensively engineered, this progress has been delayed in plants due to their complex multicellular nature and the lack of reliable DNA devices that allow an accurate design of more sophisticated biological circuits. Among these basic devices, gene switches are crucial to deploying new layers of regulation into the engineered organisms. Of special interest are bistable genetic toggle switches, which allow a living organism to exist in two alternative states and switch between them with a minimal metabolic burden. Naturally occurring toggle switches control important decision-making processes such as cell fate and developmental events. We sought to engineer whole plants with an orthogonal genetic toggle switch to be able to regulate artificial functions with minimal interference with their natural pathways. Here we report a bistable toggle memory switch for whole plants based on the phage PhiC31 serine integrase and its cognate recombination directionality factor (RDF). This genetic device was designed to control the transcription of two genes of interest by inversion of a central DNA regulatory element. Each state of the device is defined by one transcriptionally active gene of interest, while the other one remains inactive. The state of the switch can be reversibly modified by the action of the recombination actuators, which were administered externally (e.g. via agroinfiltration), or produced internally in response to an inducible chemical stimulus. We extensively characterized the kinetics, memory, and reversibility of this genetic switch in Nicotiana benthamiana through transient and stable transformation experiments using transgenic plants and hairy roots. Finally, we coupled the integrase expression to an estradiol-inducible promoter as a proof of principle of inducible activation of the switch.",

    "abstract": "Metabolomics has started to embrace computational approaches for chemical interpretation of large data sets. Yet, metabolite annotation remains a key challenge. Recently, molecular networking and MS2LDA emerged as molecular mining tools that find molecular families and substructures in mass spectrometry fragmentation data. Moreover, in silico annotation tools obtain and rank candidate molecules for fragmentation spectra. Ideally, all structural information obtained and inferred from these computational tools could be combined to increase the resulting chemical insight one can obtain from a data set. However, integration is currently hampered as each tool has its own output format and efficient matching of data across these tools is lacking. Here, we introduce MolNetEnhancer, a workflow that combines the outputs from molecular networking, MS2LDA, in silico annotation tools (such as Network Annotation Propagation or DEREPLICATOR) and the automated chemical classification through ClassyFire to provide a more comprehensive chemical overview of metabolomics data whilst at the same time illuminating structural details for each fragmentation spectrum. We present examples from four plant and bacterial case studies and show how MolNetEnhancer enables the chemical annotation, visualization, and discovery of the subtle substructural diversity within molecular families. We conclude that MolNetEnhancer is a useful tool that greatly assists the metabolomics researcher in deciphering the metabolome through combination of multiple independent in silico pipelines.",

Because RNA molecules thermally fluctuate, it is necessary to analyze the probability distribution of secondary structures. Existing methods, however, are not applicable to long RNAs owing to their high computational complexity. Additionally, previous research has suffered from two numerical difficulties: overflow and significant numerical error. In this research, we reduced the computational complexity in calculating the landscape of the probability distribution of secondary structures by introducing a maximum-span constraint. In addition, we resolved numerical computation problems through two techniques: extended logsumexp and accuracy-guaranteed numerical computation. We analyzed the stability of the secondary structures of 16S ribosomal RNAs at various temperatures without overflow. The results obtained are consistent with in vivo assay results reported in previous research. Furthermore, we quantitatively assessed numerical stability using our method. These results demonstrate that the proposed method is applicable to long RNAs. Source code is available on https://github.com/eukaryo/rintc.",

Under the conditions simulated, methods that use information across multiple samples do not necessarily perform better than some of the standard calling methods that work sample by sample.

Identifying the universal axes of clinal severity and progression is key to accelerating our understanding of how disease manifests and progresses. These universal axes would accelerate our understanding of how Parkinsons disease (PD) manifests and progresses through which patients may be appropriately compared appropriately stratified, and personalised therapeutic strategies and treatments can be developed and targeted. We developed a Bayesian multiple phenotype mixed model incorporating the genetic relationships between individuals which is able to reduce a wide-array of different clinical measurements into a smaller number of continuous underlying factors named phenotypic axis. We identify three principal axes of PD patient phenotypic variation which are reproducibly found across three independent, deeply and diversely phenotyped cohorts. Together they explain over 75% of the observed clinical variation and remain robustly captured with a fraction of the clinically-recorded features. The most influential axis was associated with the genetic risk of Alzheimers disease (AD) and involves genetic pathways associated with neuroinflammation. Our results suggest PD patients with a high genetic risk for AD are more likely to develop a more aggressive form of PD including, but not limited to, dementia.",

Voxel-wise fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity (RD) were analyzed using tract-based spatial statistics. The severities of sensory problems were assessed using the Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile (AASP).\\n\\nResultsCategorical analyses identified voxel clusters showing significant effects of DD on FA and RD in the posterior portion of the corpus callosum and its extension in the right hemisphere. Furthermore, regression analyses using the AASP scores revealed that slopes in relationships of FA or RD with the degree of sensory problems were parallel between the two DDs in large parts of the affected corpus callosum regions, although a small but significant cluster did exist showing interaction between the diagnosis of DD and an AASP subscale score on RD.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results indicate that white matter abnormalities and their relationships to sensory problems are largely shared between ASD and ADHD, with localized abnormalities showing significant between-diagnosis differences within DD.

Two leg muscles of a cockroach, have identical innervation, mass, twitch responses, length-tension curves, and force-velocity relationships. However, during running, one muscle is dissipative, while the other produces significant positive mechanical work. Using time resolved x-ray diffraction in intact, contracting muscle, we simultaneously measured the myofilament lattice spacing, packing structure, and macroscopic force production of these muscle to test if nanoscale differences could account for this conundrum. While the packing patterns are the same, one muscle has 1 nm smaller lattice spacing at rest. Under isometric activation, the difference in lattice spacing disappeared explaining the two muscles identical steady state behavior. During periodic contractions, one muscle undergoes a 1 nm greater change in lattice spacing, which correlates with force. This is the first identified feature that can account for the muscles different functions.",

Due to the lack of literature describing compliance with these recommendations in the uninsured patient population, we studied the aspirin adherence for CVD and CRC prevention in several free medical clinics. We investigated the records of 8857 uninsured patients who visited nine free medical clinics in the Tampa Bay Area in 2016-2017. Aspirin compliance was assessed for patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI) or coronary artery disease (CAD). 54% (n=1467) of patients met the criteria to take aspirin for primary prevention of CVD and CRC, but just 17% of these patients aged 50-59 were on the medication. 16% percent of patients aged 60-69 were taking aspirin and significantly more men than women were on aspirin (p=0.025). Of the 306 patients who had prior MI or CAD, 50% were on the medication for secondary prevention. Among the uninsured population, there is low compliance with recommendations for aspirin usage to reduce the risk of CVD and CRC.

We established a rat model of passive cigarette smoking-induced IVD degeneration, and investigated the cytohistological changes in the IVD and the accompanying changes in gene expression. IVD from rats exposed to 8 weeks of passive cigarette smoking were stained with Elastica van Gieson, and exhibited marked destruction of the supportive structure of the reticular matrix in the nucleus pulposus (NP). Positive signals on safranin O, alcian blue, type II collagen and aggrecan staining were decreased in the destroyed structure. Safranin O and type II collagen signals were also decreased in the cartilage end-plate (CEP) after 4- and 8-weeks of cigarette smoking. In the CEP, the potential for apoptosis was increased significantly, as demonstrated by staining for single-strand DNA. However, there were no signs of apoptosis in the NP or annulus fibrosus cells. Based on these findings, we concluded that passive cigarette smoking-induced stress stimuli first affect the CEP through blood flow due to the histological proximity, thereby stimulating chondrocyte apoptosis and reduction of the extracellular matrix (ECM). This leads to reduction of the ECM in the NP, destroying the NP matrix, which can then progress to IVD degeneration.",

    "abstract": "Dps proteins (DNA-binding proteins from starved cells) have been found to detoxify H2O2. At their catalytic centers, the ferroxidase center (FOC), Dps proteins utilize Fe2+ to reduce H2O2 and therefore play an essential role in the protection against oxidative stress and maintaining iron homeostasis. Whereas most bacteria accommodate one or two Dps, there are five different Dps proteins in Nostoc punctiforme, a phototrophic and filamentous cyanobacterium. This uncommonly high number of Dps proteins implies a sophisticated machinery for maintaining complex iron homeostasis and for protection against oxidative stress. Functional analyses and structural information on cyanobacterial Dps proteins are rare, but essential for understanding the function of each of the NpDps proteins. In this study, we present the crystal structure of NpDps4 in its metal-free, iron- and zinc-bound forms. The FOC coordinates either two iron atoms or one zinc atom. Spectroscopic analyses revealed that NpDps4 could oxidize Fe2+ utilizing O2, but no evidence for its use of the oxidant H2O2 could be found. We identified Zn2+ to be an effective inhibitor of the O2-mediated Fe2+ oxidation in NpDps4. NpDps4 exhibits a FOC that is very different from canonical Dps, but structurally similar to the atypical one from DpsA of Thermosynechococcus elongatus. Sequence comparisons among Dps protein homologs to NpDps4 within the cyanobacterial phylum led us to classify a novel FOC class: the His-type FOC. The features of this special FOC have not been identified in Dps proteins from other bacterial phyla and it might be unique to cyanobacterial Dps proteins.",

The method of fibrin-zymography was used to show the existence and activity of lumbrokinase, and we proved that the fibrin-zymogram gel could be adopted as the identification method of earthworm. Subsequently, the components were identified by mass spectrometry. According to the results, fibrinolytic related components existed in the drug. These proteins were further compared with other serine proteins. The result showed that the identified proteins were similar to human trypsin and bovine trypsin.

    "abstract": "Pachycrepoideus vindemmiae is a parasitoid of the invasive spotted-wing drosophila (SWD, Drosophila suzukii) in the U.S. Few studies have addressed interactions between these two species and little is known about the potential of this parasitoid as a biocontrol agent of SWD. Here, we investigated the impact of extrinsic and intrinsic factors on life-history traits of P. vindemmiae. Both constant (entire adulthood) and limited (30 minutes) supply of water + honey, honey, or host increased parasitoid survival compared to controls (water or fasting). Water + honey caused the highest parasitoid survivals (35-60 days), independent of supply period, sex, and host availability. Females were intrinsically more resistant to water and honey scarcity than males, and host-feeding elevated such resistance even higher. Constant supply of honey supported the highest host-killing capacity (ca. 600 SWD pupae/wasp). However, in young females (4-9 days old), such honey effect was insignificant while water deprivation (either with or without honey) resulted in the highest host-killing potential. This indicate that although sugar becomes a critical nutritional resource as females age, young females depend more on water than sugar. No effect of water nor honey was observed on the sex ratio of young females, but when we considered the entire adulthood honey supply produced the lowest proportion of females (0.50), independent of water availability. Such reduction derived from sperm depletion, likely caused by both lack of re-mating and higher fecundity in honey-fed wasps. Neither water nor honey affected parasitoid emergence rate (0.97), independent of female age. Based on survival and host-killing capacity, we conclude that P. vindemmiae has a tremendous biocontrol potential against SWD. Both limited and constant supply of water, sugar, and host increase parasitoid survival, while constant supply of water and/or honey enhance its host-killing potential and decrease sex ratio depending on mother age.",

We report here a new subunit of the mammalian MICOS/MIB complex, an armadillo repeat-containing protein 1 (ArmC1). ArmC1 localizes both to cytosol and mitochondria, where it associates with the outer mitochondrial membrane through its carboxy-terminus. ArmC1 interacts with other constituents of the MICOS/MIB complex and its amounts are reduced upon MICOS/MIB complex depletion. Mitochondria lacking ArmC1 do not show defects in cristae structure, respiration or protein content, but appear fragmented and with reduced motility. ArmC1 represents therefore a peripheral MICOS/MIB component that appears to play a role in mitochondrial distribution in the cell.",

    "abstract": "Targeted cancer therapies are powerful alternatives to chemotherapies or can be used complementary to these. Yet, the response to targeted treatments depends on a variety of factors, including mutations and expression levels, and therefore their outcome is difficult to predict. Here, we develop a mechanistic model of gastric cancer to study response and resistance factors for cetuximab treatment. The model captures the EGFR, ERK and AKT signaling pathways in two gastric cancer cell lines with different mutation patterns. We train the model using a comprehensive selection of time and dose response measurements, and provide an assessment of parameter and prediction uncertainties. We demonstrate that the proposed model facilitates the identification of causal differences between the cell lines. Furthermore, our study shows that the model provides accurate predictions for the responses to different perturbations, such as knockdown and knockout experiments. Among other results, the model predicted the effect of MET mutations on cetuximab sensitivity. These predictive capabilities render the model a powerful basis for the assessment of gastric cancer signaling and for the development and discovery of predictive biomarkers.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryUnraveling the causal differences between drug responders and non-responders is an important challenge. The information can help to understand molecular mechanisms and to guide the selection and design of targeted therapies. Here, we approach this problem for cetuximab treatment for gastric cancer using mechanistic mathematical modeling. The proposed model describes multiple gastric cancer cell lines and can accurately predict the response in several validation experiments. Our analysis provides a differentiated view on mutations and explains, for instance, the relevance of MET mutations and the insignificance of PIK3CA mutation in the considered cell lines. The model might provide the basis for understanding the recent failure of several clinical studies.",

    "abstract": "Filamentous fungi rapidly evolve in response to environmental selection pressures, exemplified by their genomic plasticity. Parastagonospora nodorum, a fungal pathogen of wheat and causal agent of septoria nodorum blotch, responds to selection pressure exerted by its host, influencing the gain, loss, or functional diversification of putative effector genes. Whole genome resequencing of 197 P. nodorum isolates collected from spring, durum, and winter wheat production regions of the United States enabled the examination of effector diversity and genomic regions under selection specific to geographically discrete populations. A total of 1,026,859 quality SNPs/InDels were identified within the natural population. Implementation of GWAS identified novel loci, as well as SnToxA and SnTox3 as major factors in disease. Genes displaying presence/absence variation and predicted effector genes, as well as genes localized on an accessory chromosome, had significantly higher pN/pS ratios, indicating a greater level of diversifying selection. Population structure analyses indicated two major P. nodorum populations corresponding to the Upper Midwest (Population 1) and Southern/Eastern United States (Population 2). Prevalence of SnToxA varied greatly between the two populations which correlated with presence of the host sensitivity gene Tsn1. Additionally, 12 and 5 candidate effector genes were observed to be diversifying among isolates from Population 1 and Population 2, respectively, but under purifying or neutral selection in the opposite population. Selective sweep analysis revealed 10 and 19 regions of positive selection from Population 1 and Population 2, respectively, with 92 genes underlying population-specific selective sweeps. Also, genes exhibiting presence/absence variation were significantly closer to transposable elements. Taken together, these results indicate that P. nodorum is rapidly adapting to distinct selection pressures unique to spring and winter wheat production regions by various routes of genomic diversification, potentially facilitated through transposable element activity.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryParastagonospora nodorum is an economically important pathogen of wheat, employing proteinaceous effector molecules to cause disease. Recognition of effectors by host susceptibility genes often leads to the elicitation of programmed cell death. However, little is known on the correlation between effector diversity and the spatial distribution of host resistance/susceptibility or the genomic mechanisms of diversification. This research presents the genome resequencing of 197 P. nodorum isolates collected from spring, winter, and durum wheat production regions of the United States, enabling the investigation of genome dynamics and evolution. Results illustrate local adaptation to host resistance or susceptibility, as evidenced by population-specific evolution of predicted effector genes and positively selected selective sweeps. Predicted effector genes, genes exhibiting presence/absence variation, and genes residing on an accessory chromosome, were found to be diversifying more rapidly. Additionally, transposable elements were predicted to play a role in the maintenance or elimination of genes. A GWAS approach identified the previously reported SnToxA and SnTox3 as well as novel virulence candidates, as major elicitors of disease on winter wheat. These results highlight the flexibility of the P. nodorum genome in response to population-specific selection pressures and illustrates the utility of whole genome resequencing for the identification of putative virulence mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Premature release of nascent ribosomes into the translating pool must be prevented, as these do not support viability and may be prone to mistakes. Here we show that the kinase Rio1, the nuclease Nob1, and its binding partner Pno1 cooperate to establish a checkpoint that prevents the escape of immature ribosomes into polysomes. Nob1 blocks mRNA recruitment, and rRNA cleavage is required for its dissociation from nascent 40S subunits, thereby setting up a checkpoint for maturation. Rio1 releases Nob1 and Pno1 from pre-40S ribosomes to discharge nascent 40S into the translating pool. Weakly binding Nob1 and Pno1 mutants can bypass the requirement for Rio1, and Pno1 mutants rescue cell viability. In these strains, immature ribosomes escape into the translating pool, where they cause fidelity defects and perturb protein homeostasis. Thus, the Rio1-Nob1-Pno1 network establishes a checkpoint that safeguards against the release of immature ribosomes into the translating pool.",

    "abstract": "In South East Asia, dengue epidemics have increased in size and geographical distribution in recent years. Most studies investigating dengue transmission and control have had an urban focus, while less consideration is currently given to rural settings, or where urban and rural areas overlap. We examined the spatiotemporal distribution and epidemiological characteristics of reported dengue cases in the predominantly rural state of Sabah, in Malaysian Borneo - an area where sylvatic and urban circulation of pathogens are known to intersect. We found that annual dengue incidence rates were spatially variable over the 7-year study period from 2010-2016 (state-wide mean annual incidence of 21 cases/100,000 people; range 5-42/100,000), but were highest in rural localities in the western districts of the state (Kuala Penyu, Nabawan, Tenom and Kota Marudu). The eastern districts exhibited lower overall dengue rates; however, we noted a concentration of severe (haemorrhagic) dengue cases (44%) in Sandakan and Tawau districts. Dengue incidence was slightly higher for males than females, and was significantly higher for both genders aged between 10 and 29 years (24/100,000; p=0.029). The largest ever recorded outbreaks occurred during 2015-2016, with the vector Aedes albopictus found to be most prevalent in both urban and rural households (House Index of 64%), compared with Ae. Aegypti (15%). These findings suggest that dengue outbreaks in Sabah are driven by the sporadic expansion of dengue virus in both urban and rural settings. This may require tailoring of preventative strategies to suit different transmission ecologies across Sabah. Further studies to better understand the drivers of dengue in Sabah may aid dengue control efforts in Malaysia, and more broadly in South East Asia.\\n\\nAuthor summaryIn order to combat the rising regional incidence of dengue in South East Asia, the drivers of transmission must be better characterised across different environmental settings. We conducted the first retrospective analysis of dengue epidemiology in the predominantly rural state of Sabah, Malaysia, where both urban and sylvatic transmission cycles exist. Human notification data over a 7-year period were reviewed and spatiotemporal and demographic risk factors identified. We found: O_LIUrban habitats and population density are not the only determinants mediating the spread of epidemic dengue in Sabah. Case from both urban and rural localities contributed equally to dengue outbreaks.\\nC_LIO_LIHuman demographic risk factors included being aged between 10 and 29 years, and being male.\\nC_LIO_LIHigh incidence areas for dengue do not predict the occurrence of severe dengue. Severe dengue was largely localised to lower incidence districts in the east of the state.\\nC_LIO_LIThe sole presence of Aedes albopictus in and around the majority of urban and rural case households suggests that this vector may play a major role in facilitating outbreaks.\\nC_LI\\n\\nA complex interplay of risk factors likely mediates dengue transmission in Sabah, influenced by both regional climate trends and localised human and ecological influences. This study emphasises that the increasing spread of dengue in urban South East Asia is also mirrored in more rural areas, and suggests a need for control strategies that address both urban and rural dengue risk.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBetween January 2015 and August 2016, two epidemic waves of Zika virus (ZIKV) disease swept the Northeastern region of Brazil. As a result, two waves of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), were observed concurrently. The mandatory reporting of ZIKV disease began region-wide in February 2016, and it is believed that ZIKV cases were significantly under-reported before that. The changing reporting rate has made it difficult to estimate the ZIKV infection attack rate, and studies in the literature vary widely from 17% to > 50%. The same applies for other key epidemiological parameters. In contrast, the diagnosis and reporting of GBS cases were reasonably reliable given the severity and easy recognition of the diseases symptoms. In this paper, we aim to estimate the real number of ZIKV cases (i.e., the infection attack rate), and their dynamics in time, by scaling up from GBS surveillance data in NE Brazil.\\n\\nMethodologyA mathematical compartmental model is constructed that makes it possible to infer the true epidemic dynamics of ZIKV cases based on surveillance data of excess GBS cases. The model includes the possibility that asymptomatic ZIKV cases are infectious. The model is fitted to the GBS surveillance data and the key epidemiological parameters are inferred by using the plug-and-play likelihood-based estimation. We make use of regional weather data to determine possible climate-driven impacts on the reproductive number [R]0, and to infer the true ZIKV epidemic dynamics.\\n\\nFindings and ConclusionsThe GBS surveillance data can be used to study ZIKV epidemics and may be appropriate when ZIKV reporting rates are not well understood. The overall infection attack rate (IAR) of ZIKV is estimated to be 24.1% (95% CI: 17.1% - 29.3%) of the population. By examining various asymptomatic scenarios, the IAR is likely to be lower than 33% over the two ZIKV waves. The risk rate from symptomatic ZIKV infection to develop GBS was estimated as{rho} = 0.0061% (95% CI: 0.0050% - 0.0086%) which is significantly less than current estimates. We found a positive association between local temperature and the basic reproduction number, [R]0. Our analysis revealed that asymptomatic infections affect the estimation of ZIKV epidemics and need to also be carefully considered in related modelling studies. According to the estimated effective reproduction number and population wide susceptibility, we comment that a ZIKV outbreak would be unlikely in NE Brazil in the near future.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe mandatory reporting of Zika virus (ZIKV) disease began region-wide in February 2016, and it is believed that ZIKV cases could have been highly under-reported before that. Given the Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is relatively well reported, the GBS surveillance data has the potential to act as a reasonably reliable proxy for inferring the true ZIKV epidemics. We developed a mathematical model incorporating the weather effects to study the ZIKV-GBS epidemics and estimated the key epidemiological parameters. We found the attack rate of ZIKV is likely lower than 33% over the two epidemic waves. The risk rate from symptomatic ZIKV case to develop GBS is likely 0.0061%. According to the analysis, we comment that there would be difficult for a ZIKV outbreak to appear in NE Brazil in the near future.",

    "abstract": "The application of machine learning algorithms for decoding psychological constructs based on neural data is becoming increasingly popular. However, there is a need for methods that allow to interpret trained decoding models, as a step towards bridging the gap between theory-driven cognitive neuroscience and data-driven decoding approaches. The present study demonstrates grouped model reliance as a model-agnostic permutation-based approach to this problem. Grouped model reliance indicates the extent to which a trained model relies on conceptually related groups of variables, such as frequency bands or regions of interest in electroencephalographic (EEG) data. As a case study to demonstrate the method, random forest and support vector machine models were trained on within-participant single-trial EEG data from a Sternberg working memory task. Participants were asked to memorize a sequence of digits (0-9), varying randomly in length between one, four and seven digits, where EEG recordings for working memory load estimation were taken from a 3-second retention interval. Present results confirm previous findings in so far, as both random forest and support vector machine models relied on alpha-band activity in most subjects. However, as revealed by further analyses, patterns in frequency and particularly topography varied considerably between individuals, pointing to more pronounced inter-individual differences than reported previously.\n\nAuthor summaryModern machine learning algorithms currently receive considerable attention for their predictive power in neural decoding applications. However, there is a need for methods that make such predictive models interpretable. In the present work, we address the problem of assessing which aspects of the input data a trained model relies upon to make predictions. We demonstrate the use of grouped model-reliance as a generally applicable method for interpreting neural decoding models. Illustrating the method on a case study, we employed an experimental design in which a comparably small number of participants (10) completed a large number of trials (972) over multiple electroencephalography (EEG) recording sessions from a Sternberg working memory task. Trained decoding models consistently relied on alpha frequency activity, which is in line with existing research on the relationship between neural oscillations and working memory. However, our analyses also indicate large inter-individual variability with respect to the relation between activity patterns and working memory load in frequency and topography. Taken together, we argue that grouped model reliance provides a useful tool to better understand the workings of (sometimes otherwise black-box) decoding models.",

    "abstract": "Decisions are occasionally accompanied by changes-of-mind. While considered a hallmark of cognitive flexibility, the mechanisms underlying changes-of-mind remain elusive. Previous studies on perceptual decision making have focused on changes-of-mind that are primarily driven by the accumulation of additional noisy sensory evidence after the initial decision. In a motion discrimination task, we demonstrate that changes-of-mind can occur even in the absence of additional evidence after the initial decision. Unlike previous studies of changes-of-mind, the majority of changes-of-mind in our experiment occurred in trials with prolonged initial response times. This suggests a distinct mechanism underlying such changes. Using a neural circuit model of decision uncertainty and change-of-mind behaviour, we demonstrate that this phenomenon is associated with top-down signals mediated by an uncertainty-monitoring neural population. Such a mechanism is consistent with recent neurophysiological evidence showing a link between changes-of-mind and elevated top-down neural activity. Our model explains the long response times associated with changes-of-mind through high decision uncertainty levels in such trials, and accounts for the observed motor response trajectories. Overall, our work provides a computational framework that explains changes-of-mind in the absence of new post-decision evidence.\\n\\nAuthors SummaryWe used limited availability of sensory evidence during a standard motion discrimination task, and demonstrated that changes-of-mind could occur long after sensory information was no longer available. Unlike previous studies, our experiment further indicated that changes-of-mind were strongly linked to slow response time. We used a reduced version of a previously developed neural computational model of decision uncertainty and change-of-mind to account for these experimental observations. Importantly, our model showed that the replication of these experimental results required a strong link between change-of-mind and high decision uncertainty (i.e. low decision confidence), supporting the notion that change-of-mind are related to decision uncertainty or confidence.",

    "abstract": "Urbanization could potentially modify Aedes albopictus ecology by changing the dynamics of the species, and increasing the abundance of their breeding sites due to environmental changes, and thus contribute to dengue outbreaks. An efficient control of the vector requires a deeper understanding on the biological components of this vector. Thus, this study was conducted to evaluate the biting rhythm, fecundity and longevity rate of Ae. albopictus in relation to urbanization strata; urban, suburban and rural areas in Penang Island, Malaysia. The experiments were done in comparison to a laboratory strain. Twenty-four hours biting activity of all the mosquito strains showed a clear bimodal biting activity, with morning and evening twilight peaks. A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) found that there was statistically no significant interaction (F(69,192) = 1.337, P > 0.05) between the effects of biting time and mosquito strains. Meanwhile, fecundity rates were shown to be statistically significantly different between mosquito strains (F(3,442) = 10.559, P < 0.05) with urban areas having higher mean number of eggs (mean = 107.69, standard error = 3.98) than suburban (mean = 94.48, standard error = 5.18), and rural areas (mean = 72.52, standard error = 3.87). Longevity rates were significantly higher (F(3,441) = 31.259, P < 0.05) for mosquito strains from urban areas compared to the other strains. These findings would provide crucial and relevant fundamental information to the planning of control program in Malaysia, particularly Penang.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAedes mosquito populations associated with human habitation in urban area do not only have the potential to cause biting nuisance, but also cause significant public health risks through the transmission of dengue virus. The socioeconomic effects of urbanization have been comprehensively studied by socio-ecologists, but the ecological effects and their impact on this vector biology was not known. The authors found that in Penang Island, the mean number of eggs laid per female of Aedes albopictus is high in the urban areas than those in suburban and rural areas. The survivorship is high for urban populations parallel to the fecundity rate and apparent biting pattern which is peak at dawn and dusk was noted for all Ae. albopictus strains. The changed environment in the urbanized area where more kinds of breeding containers and more blood sources produced by condensed human population supported by warm climate may facilitate larval development, enhance the vector survivorship and its reproductive fitness. These might be the reasons for quick adaptation and susceptibility of Ae. albopictus in urban areas. As higher fecundity rate and longer adult survival may enhance disease transmission, this species studied is indeed need high attention in terms of vector control.",

    "abstract": "Many complex human traits exhibit differences between sexes. While numerous factors likely contribute to this phenomenon, growing evidence from genome-wide studies suggest a partial explanation: that males and females from the same population possess differing genetic architectures. Despite this, mapping gene-by-sex (GxS) interactions remains a challenge likely because the magnitude of such an interaction is typically and exceedingly small; traditional genome-wide association techniques may be underpowered to detect such events partly due to the burden of multiple test correction. Here, we developed a local Bayesian regression (LBR) method to estimate sex-specific SNP marker effects after fully accounting for local linkage-disequilibrium (LD) patterns. This enabled us to infer sex-specific effects and GxS interactions either at the single SNP level, or by aggregating the effects of multiple SNPs to make inferences at the level of small LD-based regions. Using simulations in which there was imperfect LD between SNPs and causal variants, we showed that aggregating sex-specific marker effects with LBR provides improved power and resolution to detect GxS interactions over traditional single-SNP-based tests. When using LBR to analyze traits from the UK Biobank, we detected a relatively large GxS interaction impacting bone-mineral density within ABO and replicated many previously detected large-magnitude GxS interactions impacting waist-to-hip ratio. We also discovered many new GxS interactions impacting such traits as height and BMI within regions of the genome where both male- and female-specific effects explain a small proportion of phenotypic variance (R2 < 1x10-4), but are enriched in known expression quantitative trait loci. By combining biobank-level data and techniques to estimate sex-specific SNP effects after accounting for local-LD patterns, we are providing evidence that numerous small-magnitude GxS interactions exist to influence sex differences in a variety of complex traits.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMany complex human traits are known to be influenced by an impressive number of causal variants each with very small effects, posing great challenges for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). To add to this challenge, many causal variants may possess context-dependent effects such as effects that are dependent on biological sex. While GWAS are commonly performed using specific methods in which one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at a time is tested for association with a trait, alternatively we utilize methods more commonly observed in the genomic prediction literature. Such methods are advantageous in that they are not burdened by multiple test correction in the same way as traditional GWAS techniques are, and can fully account for linkage-disequilibrium patterns to accurately estimate the true effects of SNP markers. Here we adapt such methods to estimate genetic effects within sexes and provide a powerful means to compare sex-specific genetic effects.",

    "abstract": "Antibodies targeting negative regulators of immune checkpoints have shown unprecedented and durable response against variety of malignancies. While the concept of blocking the negative regulators of immune checkpoints using mAbs appears to be an outstanding approach, their limited effect and several drawbacks such as resistance, poor solid tumor penetration and so on, calls for the rational design of next generation of therapeutics. Soluble isoforms of negative regulators of immune checkpoints are expressed naturally and are shown to regulate the immune response, suggesting the soluble version of these molecules and affinity-modified versions of these self-molecules could be effective lead molecules for immunotherapy. To get a better insight on hotspot regions for modification, we have analysed structures of available immune receptor:ligand complexes containing IgV domains. Interestingly, this analysis reveals that the CC' loop of IgV domain, a loop which is distinct from CDRs which are generally utilized by antibodies to recognize antigens, plays a pivotal role in affinity modulation. Here, we present several examples of cognate partner specific conformational variation observed in CC' loop of several checkpoint receptor:ligand complexes. In addition, in silico swapping of CC' loop targeting TIGIT:Nectin-2/PVR pathway corroborated well with biophysically determined affinity values for these complexes. Thus, CC' loop appears to be a hotspot for affinity modification without affecting the specificity to their cognate receptors, an important requirement to avoid unintended interaction of these modified molecules with undesired targets.",

These so called cryo-lamellae allow high-resolution structural studies of the natural cellular environment by in situ cryo-electron tomography. However, the cryo-lamella workflow is a low-throughput technique and can easily be obstructed by technical issues like the bending of the lamellae during the final cryo-FIB-milling steps. The severity of lamella bending seems to correlate with shrinkage of the EM grid support film at cryogenic temperatures, which could generate tensions that may be transferred onto the thin lamella, leading to its bending and breakage. To protect the lamellae from these forces, we milled \\\"micro-expansion joints\\\" alongside the lamellae, creating gaps in the support that can act as physical buffers to safely absorb material motion. We demonstrate that the presence of such micro-expansion joints drastically decreases lamella bending. Furthermore, we show that this adaptation does not create instabilities that could constrain subsequent parts of the cryo-lamella workflow, as we obtained high-quality Volta phase plate tomograms revealing macromolecules in their natural structural context. The minimal additional effort required to implement micro-expansion joints in the cryo-FIB-milling workflow makes them an easy solution against cryo-lamella bending in any biological sample milled on EM grids.",

    "abstract": "While the principles of decision-making are often expressed in terms of benefit-cost trade-off, reasonable doubt remains as to how the cognitive value and motor cost associated to several options may be computed across several brain areas, ultimately leading to a decision. Furthermore, does the assessment of non-chosen options continue after the decision has been made and the selected movement is already ongoing? Does the planning of several motor options depend on a unique parallel process or are there some elements within the sensorimotor loop requiring a sequential processing? Our hypothesis is that a change of available prospects at any point in time should dynamically adjust the desirability for each option, implying a fast reassessment of values and costs across prefrontal and motor cortical areas, even after an initial decision has been made and its associated response movement is ongoing. To test this, we performed a decision-making task in which human participants were instructed to select a reaching path trajectory from an origin to a wide rectangular target to gain the most reward. Reward delivery was contingent upon the distribution of value and upon precise target arrival. The original value distribution was altered during the ongoing movement in one third of the trials. Our results show that participants changed their movement trajectories towards the target position offering a better prospect, as presented by the second distribution. The changes of mind occurred more frequently for slow movements, had a duration in average inferior to the reaction time, and altered the initial timing and movement velocity. Although reward is the main factor guiding the selection of a specific movement in our experiment, our results indicate that the motor system was biased towards early changes of mind, given that the amplitude of the first acceleration and velocity peaks was significantly smaller in trials in which the participant switched target side and those in which they stuck to their original choice. Finally, the short latency of the recorded changes of mind strongly supports the hypothesis that, for the experimental conditions hereby considered, value considerations occur in parallel to motor planning.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death in children and young adults; however, new pharmacologic approaches have failed to improve outcomes in clinical trials. Transporter proteins are central to the maintenance of homeostasis within the neurovascular unit, and regulate drug penetration into the brain. Our objective was to measure transporter temporal changes in expression in the hippocampus and cortex after experimental TBI in developing rats. We also evaluated the expression of transporters in brain, liver, and kidney across the age spectrum in both pediatric and adult rats. Eighty post-natal day (PND)-17 rats and four adult rats were randomized to receive controlled cortical impact (CCI), sham surgery, or no surgery. mRNA transcript counts for 27 ATP-binding cassette and solute carrier transporters were measured in the hippocampus, cortex, choroid plexus, liver, and kidney at 3h, 12h, 24h, 72h, 7d, and 14d post injury. After TBI, the expression of many transporters (Abcc2, Slc15a2, Slco1a2) decreased significantly in the first 24 hours, with a return to baseline over 7-14 days. Some transporters (Abcc4, Abab1a/b, Slc22a4) showed a delayed increase in expression. Baseline expression of transporters was of a similar order of magnitude in brain tissues relative to liver and kidney. Findings suggest that transporter-regulated processes may be impaired in the brain early after TBI and are potentially involved in the recovery of the neurovascular unit. Our data also suggest that transport-dependent processes in the brain are of similar importance as those seen in organs involved in drug metabolism and excretion.\\n\\nSignificance StatementBaseline transporter mRNA expression in the central nervous system is of similar magnitude as liver and kidney, and experimental traumatic brain injury is associated with acute decrease in expression of several transporters, while others show delayed increase or decrease in expression. Pharmacotherapy following traumatic brain injury should consider potential pharmacokinetic changes associated with transporter expression.",

Here we find that in addition to increased insulin secretion, SC-{beta} cells have increased cellular respiration and cytoplasmic calcium ion concentration in response to a high glucose stimulation.

Deletion of BFR1 leads to multiple defects, including altered cell shape and size, change in ploidy, induction of P-bodies and chromosomal mis-segregation. Bfr1p has been shown to associate with polysomes, binds to several hundred mRNAs, and can target some of them to P-bodies. Although this implies a role of Bfr1p in translational control of mRNAs, its molecular function remains elusive. In the present study, we show that mutations in RNA-binding residues of Bfr1p impede its RNA-dependent co-localization with ER, yet do not mimic the known cellular defects seen upon BFR1 deletion. However, a Bfr1 RNA-binding mutant is impaired in binding to ERG4 mRNA which encodes an enzyme required for the final step of ergosterol biosynthesis. Consistently, bfr1{Delta} strains show a strong reduction in Erg4p protein levels. Polysome profiling of bfr1{Delta} or bfr1 mutant strains reveals a strong shift of ERG4 mRNA to polysomes, consistent with a function of Bfr1p in elongation. Collectively, our data reveal that Bfr1 has at least two separable functions: one in RNA-binding and elongation during translation, in particular at the ER membrane, and one in ploidy control or chromosome segregation.",

We used exome sequencing to discover a missense mutation in Nucleotide Binding Protein 2 (Nubp2) to be causative. This finding was confirmed with a complementation analysis between the dorothy allele and a Nubp2 null allele (Nubp2Null). We demonstrate that Nubp2 is indispensable for embryogenesis. NUBP2 is implicated in both the Cytosolic Iron/Sulfur cluster Assembly (CIA) pathway and in the negative regulation of ciliogenesis. Conditional ablation of Nubp2 in the neural crest lineage with Wnt1-cre recapitulates the dorothy craniofacial phenotype. Using this model, we found that the proportion of ciliated cells in the craniofacial mesenchyme was unchanged, and that markers of the Shh, Fgf, and Bmp signaling pathways are unaltered. Finally, we show that the phenotype results from a marked increase in apoptosis within the craniofacial mesenchyme.\\n\\nSummary StatementAn ENU screen identifies a novel allele of Nubp2 which is then demonstrated to be required for cranial neural crest survival and proper midfacial development.",

    "abstract": "O_LISpecies distribution models (SDMs) are an increasingly popular tool in ecology which, together with a vast wealth of data from citizen science projects, have the potential to dramatically improve our understanding of species behaviour for applications such as conservation and wildlife management. However, many of the best performing models require information regarding survey effort, specifically absence, which is typically lacking in opportunistic datasets. To facilitate the use of such models, pseudo-absences from locations without recorded presence must be assumed. Several studies have suggested that survey effort, and hence likely absence, could be estimated from presence-only data by considering records across \\\"target groups\\\" of species defined according to taxonomy.\\nC_LIO_LIWe performed a probabilistic analysis, computing the conditional probability of recording a species given a particular set of species are also recorded, to test the validity of defining target groups by taxonomic order and to explore other potential groupings. Based on this quantification of recording associations we outline a new method to inform pseudo-absence selection comparing predictive performance, measured the area under curve (AUC) statistic, against the standard method of selection across a series of SDMs.\\nC_LIO_LIOur findings show some support for target grouping classification based on taxonomy but indicate that an alternative classification using survey method may be more appropriate for informing effort and consequently absence. Across 49 terrestrial mammal species, pseudo-absence selection using our proposed method outperformed that of the standard method showing an improvement in the predictive performance of presence-absence models for 17 out of 22 with sufficient data to elicit a significant difference. Based on our method we also observed a substantial improvement in the performance of presence-absence models compared to that of presence-only models (MaxEnt) with a higher AUC for all 22 species showing a significant difference between approaches.\\nC_LIO_LIWe conclude that our method produces sensible robust pseudo-absences which either compliment patterns in known presences or, where conflicts occur, are explainable in terms of ecological variables potentially improving our understanding of species behaviour. Furthermore, we suggest that presence-absence models using these pseudo-absences provide a viable alternative to MaxEnt when modelling using presence-only data.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Genetic correlations between traits may cause correlated responses to selection. Previous models described the conditions under which genetic correlations are expected to be maintained. Selection, mutation and migration are all proposed to affect genetic correlations, regardless of whether the underlying genetic architecture consists of pleiotropic or tightly-linked loci affecting the traits. Here, we investigate the conditions under which pleiotropy and linkage have differential effects on the genetic correlations between traits by explicitly modeling multiple genetic architectures to look at the effects of selection strength, degree of correlational selection, mutation rate, mutational variance, recombination rate, and migration rate. We show that at mutation-selection(-migration) balance, mutation rates differentially affect the equilibrium levels of genetic correlation when architectures are composed of pairs of physically linked loci compared to architectures of pleiotropic loci. Even when there is perfect linkage (no recombination within pairs of linked loci), a lower genetic correlation is maintained than with pleiotropy, with a lower mutation rate leading to a larger decrease. These results imply that the detection of causal loci in multi-trait association studies will be affected by the type of underlying architectures, whereby pleiotropic variants are more likely to be underlying multiple detected associations. We also confirm that tighter linkage between non-pleiotropic causal loci maintains higher genetic correlations at the traits and leads to a greater proportion of false positives in association analyses.",

However, RNA degradation is extensive when isolated from FFPE blocks making it challenging for whole transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq). Here, we examined RNA isolation methods, quality metrics, and the performance of RNA-seq using different approaches with RNA isolated from FFPE and fresh frozen (FF) tissues. We evaluated FFPE RNA extraction methods using six different tissues and five different methods. The reproducibility and quality of the prepared libraries from these RNAs were assessed by RNA-seq. We next examined the performance and reproducibility of RNA-seq for gene expression profiling with FFPE and FF samples using targeted (Kinome capture) and whole transcriptome capture based sequencing. Finally, we assessed Agilent SureSelect All-Exon V6+UTR capture and the Illumina TruSeq RNA Access protocols for their ability to detect known gene fusions in FFPE RNA samples. Although the overall yield of RNA varied among extraction methods, gene expression profiles generated by RNA-seq were highly correlated (>90%) when the input RNA was of sufficient quality ([&ge;]DV200 30%) and quantity ([&ge;] 100 ng). Using gene capture, we observed a linear relationship between gene expression levels for shared genes that were captured using either All-Exon or Kinome kits. Gene expression correlations between the two capture-based approaches were similar using RNA from FFPE and FF samples. However, TruSeq RNA Access protocol provided significantly higher exon and junction reads when compared to the SureSelect All-Exon capture kit and was more sensitive for fusion gene detection. Our study established pre and post library construction QC parameters that are essential to reproducible RNA-seq profiling using FFPE samples. We show that gene capture based NGS sequencing is an efficient and highly reproducible strategy for gene expression measurements as well as fusion gene detection.",

We hypothesized that patients with detectable circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) were more likely to harbor aggressive disease. We applied ultra-low pass whole genome sequencing to profile cell-free DNA from 112 patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer and performed targeted resequencing of plasma DNA for somatic mutations previously identified in matched solid tumor in nine cases. We also performed similar analyses on patients with metastatic prostate cancer. In all cases of localized disease, even in clinically high-risk patients who subsequently recurred, we did not detect ctDNA by either method in plasma acquired before surgery or before recurrence. In contrast, ctDNA was detected from patients with metastatic disease. Our findings demonstrate clear differences between localized and advanced prostate cancer with respect to the dissemination and detectability of ctDNA. Because allele-specific alterations in ctDNA are below the threshold for detection in localized prostate cancer, other approaches to identify cell-free nucleic acids of tumor origin may demonstrate better specificity for aggressive disease.",

Despite displaying clinical inactivity during treatment, many patients will flare upon cessation of therapy. The inability to definitively discriminate patients who will relapse or continue to remain in remission after therapy withdrawal is currently a major unmet medical need. CD4 T cells have been implicated in active disease, yet how they contribute to disease persistence despite treatment is unknown.\\n\\nMethodsWe interrogated the circulatory reservoir of CD4+ immune subsets at the single cell resolution with mass cytometry (CyToF) of JIA patients (n=20) who displayed continuous clinical inactivity for at least 6 months with anti-TNF, and were subsequently withdrawn from therapy for 8 months, and scored as relapse or remission. These patients were examined prior to therapy withdrawal for putative subsets that could discriminate relapse from remission. We verified on a separate JIA cohort (n=16), the continued dysregulation of these circulatory subsets 8 months into therapy withdrawal. The immunological transcriptomic signature of CD4 memory in relapse/remission patients was examined with Nanostring.\\n\\nResultsAn inflammatory memory subset of CD3+CD4+CD45RA-TNF+ T cells deficient in immune checkpoints (PD1-CD152-) was present in relapse patients prior to therapy withdrawal. Transcriptomic profiling reveals divergence between relapse and remission patients in disease centric pathways involving (a) TCR activation, (b) apoptosis, (c) TNF, (d) NF-kB and (e) MAPK signalling.\\n\\nConclusionsA unique discriminatory immunomic and transcriptomic signature is associated with relapse patients and may explain how relapse occurs.",

    "abstract": "Much of our world changes smoothly in time, yet the allocation of attention is typically studied with sudden changes - transients. When stimuli change gradually there is a sizeable lag between when a cue is presented and when an object is sampled (Carlson, Hogendoorn, & Verstraten, 2006; Sheth, Nijhawan & Shimojo, 2000). Yet this lag is not seen with rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) stimuli where temporally uncorrelated stimuli are presented (Vul, Kanwisher & Nieuwenstein 2008; Goodbourn & Holcombe, 2015). These findings collectively suggest that temporal autocorrelation of a feature paradoxically increases the latency at which information is sampled. This hypothesis was tested by comparing stimuli changing smoothly in time (autocorrelated) to stimuli that change randomly. Participants attempted to report the color coincident with a visual cue. The result was a smaller selection lag for the randomly varying condition relative to the condition with a smooth color trajectory. Our third experiment finds that the increase in selection latency is due to the smoothness of the color change after the cue rather than extrapolated predictions based on the color changes presented before the cue. Together, these results support a theory of attentional drag, whereby attention remains engaged at a location longer when features are changing smoothly. A computational model provides insights into neural mechanisms that might underlie the effect.",

    "abstract": "In exploring the epidemiology of infectious diseases, networks have been used to reconstruct contacts among individuals and/or populations. Summarizing networks using pathogen metadata (e.g., host species and place of isolation) and a phylogenetic tree is a nascent, alternative approach. In this paper, we introduce a tool for reconstructing transmission networks in arbitrary space from phylogenetic information and metadata. Our goals are to provide a means of deriving new insights and infection control strategies based on the dynamics of the pathogen lineages derived from networks and centrality metrics. We created a web-based application, called StrainHub, in which a user can input a phylogenetic tree based on genetic or other data along with characters derived from metadata using their preferred tree search method. StrainHub generates a transmission network based on character state changes in meta-data, such as place or source of isolation, mapped on the phylogenetic tree. The user has the option to calculate centrality metrics on the nodes including betweenness, closeness, degree, and a new metric, the source/hub ratio. The outputs include the network with values for metrics on its nodes and the tree with characters reconstructed. All of these results can be exported for further analysis.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/abschneider/StrainHub and strainhub.io",

    "abstract": "O_LIComplex networks have been useful to link experimental data with mechanistic models, and have become widely used across many scientific disciplines. Recently, the increasing amount and complexity of data, particularly in biology, has prompted the development of multidimensional networks, where dimensions reflect the multiple qualitative properties of nodes, links, or both. As a consequence, traditional quantities computed in single dimensional networks should be adapted to incorporate this new information. A particularly important problem is the detection of communities, namely sets of nodes sharing certain properties, which reduces the complexity of the networks, hence facilitating its interpretation.\nC_LIO_LIIn this work, we propose an operative definition of \"function\" for the nodes in multidimensional networks, and we exploit this definition to show that it is possible to detect two types of communities: i) modules, which are communities more densely connected within their members than with nodes belonging to other communities, and ii) guilds, which are sets of nodes connected with the same neighbours, even if they are not connected themselves. We provide two quantities to optimally detect both types of communities, whose relative values reflect their importance in the network.\nC_LIO_LIThe flexibility of the method allowed us to analyze different ecological examples encompassing mutualistic, trophic and microbial networks. We showed that by considering both metrics we were able to obtain deeper ecological insights about how these different ecological communities were structured. The method mapped pools of species with properties that were known in advance, such as plants and pollinators. Other types of communities found, when contrasted with external data, turned out to be ecologically meaningful, allowing us to identify species with important functional roles or the influence of environmental variables. Furthermore, we found the method was sensitive to community-level topological properties like the nestedness.\nC_LIO_LIIn ecology there is often a need to identify groupings including trophic levels, guilds, functional groups, or ecotypes.The method is therefore important in providing an objective means of distinguishing modules and guilds. The method we developed, functionInk (functional linkage), is computationally efficient at handling large multidimensional networks since it does not require optimization procedures or tests of robustness.

Matched tumor was cultured to create high grade glioma cell lines analyzed by targeted and WGS and RNA-seq. A tissue microarray (TMA) of primary pHGG tumors was also created.\\n\\nResultsThe pHGG set included 87 collection events (73 patients, 60% at diagnosis, median age of 9 yrs, 55% female, 46% hemispheric). Analysis of somatic mutations and copy number alterations of known glioma genes were of expected distribution (36% H3.3, 47% TP53, 24% ATRX and 7% BRAF V600E variants). A pHGG TMA (n=77), includes 36 (53%) patient tumors with matched sequencing. At least one established glioma cell line was generated from 23 patients (32%). Unique reagents include those derived from a H3.3 G34R glioma and from tumors with mismatch repair deficiency.\\n\\nConclusionThe CBTTC and PBTA have created an openly available integrated resource of over 2,000 tumors, including a rich set of pHGG primary tumors, corresponding cell lines and archival fixed tissue to advance translational research for pHGG.\\n\\nIMPORTANCE OF STUDYHigh-grade gliomas (HGG) remain the leading cause of cancer death in children. Since molecularly heterogeneous, preclinical studies of pediatric HGG will be most informative if able to compare across groups. Given their relatively rarity, there are few readily available biospecimens and cellular models to inform preclinical laboratory and genomic translational research. Therefore, the aim of this CBTTC study was to highlight the panel of pediatric HGG cases whose primary tumors have undergone extensive genomic analysis, have clinical data, available imaging and additional biospecimens, including tumor, nucleic acids, cell lines and FFPE tissue on a tissue microarray (TMA).",

A better understanding of the growth and drivers of settlement of zebra mussel is necessary for a more efficient management of this invasive species, but seasonal data are still relatively scant. We monitored the seasonal changes in settlement rates, density, and growth of zebra mussel in artificial substrates over one year in Cardiff Bay (UK), an artificial amenity lake invaded by zebra mussels in 2003 and where the species is rapidly expanding. Mean settling rates varied from 4,200 to 6,200 mussel m-2 over June to September mirroring changes in water temperature, and peaked at 17,960 mussels m-2, the highest density reported in Britain. Density was highest at the deepest panels (3 m). Growth varied significantly among sampling stations, with growth taking place during the summer and ceasing during winter and spring. Mixture analysis reveals the existence of multiple cohorts displaying different growth and settling rates and that follow different density dependent mechanisms, being positive density-dependent at low densities, and negative density-dependent at high densities. We suggest this creates the conditions necessary for source and sink metapopulations to develop which may need to be taken into account in management. Targeting mussels for removal in deep waters during the summer and early autumn might prove beneficial, but the existence of contrasting density-dependent mechanisms suggests that removal may be beneficial or counterproductive depending on local conditions.",

Recent experiments provide glimpses of processes underpinning the transition from single cells to multicellular life and draw attention to the critical role of ecology. Here we emphasise this ecological dimension and argue that its current absence from theoretical frameworks hampers development of general explanatory solutions. Using mechanistic mathematical models, we show how a minimal ecological structure comprised of patchily distributed resources and between patch dispersal can scaffold Darwinian-like properties on collectives of cells. This scaffolding causes cells to participate directly in the process of evolution by natural selection as if they were members of multicellular collectives, with collectives participating in a death-birth process arising from the interplay between the timing of dispersal events and the rate of resource utilisation by cells. When this timescale is sufficiently long and new collectives are founded by single cells, collectives experience conditions that favour evolution of a reproductive division of labour. Together our simple model makes explicit key events in the major evolutionary transition to multicellularity. It also makes predictions concerning the life history of certain pathogens and serves as an ecological recipe for experimental realisation of evolutionary transitions.",

Among the most crucial reactions in this cycle is the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite, an obligately aerobic process performed by a limited number of lineages of bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA). As this process has an absolute requirement for O2, the timing of its evolution - especially as it relates to the Great Oxygenation Event ~2.3 billion years ago - remains contested and is pivotal to our understanding of nutrient cycles. To estimate the antiquity of bacterial ammonia oxidation, we performed phylogenetic and molecular clock analyses of AOB. Surprisingly, bacterial ammonia oxidation appears quite young, with crown group clades having originated during Neoproterozoic time (or later) with major radiations occurring during Paleozoic time. These results place the evolution of AOB broadly coincident with the pervasive oxygenation of the deep ocean. The late evolution AOB challenges earlier interpretations of the ancient nitrogen isotope record, predicts a more substantial role for AOA during Precambrian time, and may have implications for understanding of the size and structure of the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle through geologic time.",

    "abstract": "Anhedonia is a core feature of several psychiatric disorders but its biological underpinnings are poorly understood. We performed a genome-wide association study of anhedonia in 375,275 UK Biobank participants and assessed for genetic correlation between anhedonia and neuropsychiatric conditions (major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder and Parkinsons Disease). We then used a polygenic risk score approach to test for association between genetic loading for anhedonia and both brain structure and brain function. This included: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessments of total grey matter volume, white matter volume, cerebrospinal fluid volume, and 15 cortical/subcortical regions of interest; diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures of white matter tract integrity; and functional MRI activity during an emotion processing task. We identified 11 novel loci associated at genome-wide significance with anhedonia, with a SNP heritability estimate (h2SNP) of 5.6%. Strong positive genetic correlations were found between anhedonia and major depressive disorder, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder; but not with obsessive compulsive disorder or Parkinsons Disease. Polygenic risk for anhedonia was associated with poorer brain white matter integrity, smaller total grey matter volume, and smaller volumes of brain regions linked to reward and pleasure processing, including nucleus accumbens, caudate and medial frontal cortex. In summary, the identification of novel anhedonia-associated loci substantially expands our current understanding of the biological basis of anhedonia and genetic correlations with several psychiatric disorders confirm the utility of this trait as a transdiagnostic marker of vulnerability to mental illness. We also provide the first evidence that genetic risk for anhedonia influences brain structure, particularly in regions associated with reward and pleasure processing.",

    "abstract": "Plant roots live closely associated with soil microbes. Understanding how roots defend against pathogenic microbes while associating with non-pathogenic microbes is critical to using root microbiomes for successful outcomes. The aim of this study was to determine the contribution of the plant defense hormones ethylene (ET), jasmonic acid (JA), and salicylic acid (SA) to the tomato root microbiome. We used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to examine the root microbiome of four tomato genotypes defective in three hormone pathways. We found that ET and SA pathways, but not JA, were critical for root endosphere microbial alpha ()-diversity. Root endosphere communities of ACD, deficient in a precursor of ET, and the SA-deficient NahG transgenic, had significantly less -diversity than wild-type tomatoes. NahG and ACD root endosphere enrichment profiles were similar and driven by two taxa. In NahG, ACD, and in a panel of 24 wild-type tomatoes, the abundance of these two taxa was correlated with lower root endosphere -diversity. The abundance of these taxa was also moderately negatively correlated with the level of SA in roots. Our results suggest that SA and ET pathways contribute to tomato root endosphere diversity by modulating the abundance of specific bacterial taxa.",

High-resolution structure determination using experimental methods that yield distributional data remains extremely difficult, especially when the underlying conformational ensembles are quite heterogeneous. We have therefore developed a method to integrate sparse, multi-multimodal spectroscopic data to obtain high-resolution estimates of conformational ensembles. We have tested our method by incorporating double electron-electron resonance data on the SNARE protein syntaxin-1a into biased molecular dynamics simulations. We find that our method substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in capturing syntaxins open/closed conformational equilibrium and further yields new conformational states that are both consistent with experimental data and may help in understanding syntaxins function. Our improved methods for refining heterogeneous conformational ensembles from spectroscopic data will greatly accelerate the structural understanding of such systems.",

Successful licks required previously unobserved corrective submovements (CSMs) which, like online corrections during primate reaches3-10, occurred after the tongue missed unseen, distant, or displaced targets. Photoinhibition of anterolateral motor cortex (ALM) impaired online corrections, resulting in hypometric licks that missed the spout.

    "abstract": "In cancer cells metabolic changes and mitochondrial morphology are coupled. It is known that the cytoskeleton and molecular motors are directly involved in regulating mitochondrial morphology. Here we show that myosin-Va, an actin-based molecular motor, is required for the malignant properties of melanoma cells and localizes to mitochondria in these cells. Knockdown of myosin-Va increases cellular respiration rates and ROS production and decreases glucose uptake and lactate secretion. In addition, knockdown of myosin-Va results in reduced mitochondrial fission and correspondingly elongated mitochondria. We show that myosin-Va interacts with the mitochondrial outer membrane protein Spire1C, an actin-regulatory protein implicated in mitochondrial fission, and that Spire1C recruits myosin-Va to mitochondria. Finally, we show that during mitochondrial fission myosin-Va localization to mitochondria increases, and that myosin-Va localizes to mitochondrial fission sites immediately adjacent to Drp1 punctae. We conclude that myosin-Va facilitates mitochondrial fission. These data implicate myosin-Va as a target for the Warburg effect in melanoma cells.\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=81 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/655803v1_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (35K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1130e72org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@196619org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17e09edorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bdc311_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The Replication factor-C compex which related to cohesion, constitutes, three subunits called Ctf18, Ctf8 and Dcc1. These three subunit complex assist the loading of PCNA onto the chromosome. None of the replication factor C components are essential for cell viability. The null mutant of the CTF8 in S.cerevisiae shows the chromosome instability and high frequency of chromosome loss. The SAF1 gene product of S. cerevisiae involved in the degradation of adenine deaminase factor Aah1p by SCF-E3 ligase, which itself is the part of E3 ligase. The ubiquitin marked degradation of Aah1p occurs during nutrient stress which lead to cell enter into the quiescent state. The N-terminus of Saf1p interacts with the Skp1 of SCF-E3 ligase and at C-terminus recruits with Aah1p. Here we have investigated about the binary genetic interaction between the SAF1 and CTF8 genes. The strains containing single and double gene deletions of SAF1 and CTF8 were constructed in the BY4741 genetic background. Further the mutant strains were evaluated for growth fitness, genome stability and response to genotoxic stress caused by hydroxyurea (HU) and methyl methane sulfonate (MMS). The saf1{Delta}ctf8{Delta} strain showed the increased growth phenotype in comparison to saf1{Delta}, ctf8{Delta}, and WT strain on YPD medium. However saf1{Delta}ctf8{Delta} strain when grown in the presence MMS showed resistance and HU sensitive phenotype when compared with saf1{Delta}, ctf8{Delta}. The frequency of Ty1 retro-transposition was also elevated in saf1{Delta}ctf8{Delta} in comparison to either saf1{Delta} or ctf8{Delta}. The number of cells showing the two or multi-nuclei phenotype was also increased in saf1{Delta}ctf8{Delta} cells when compared with the either saf1{Delta} or ctf8{Delta}. Based on these observations, we report that the absence of both the gene SAF1 and CTF8 together leads to MMS resistance, HU sensitivity, and genome instability. This report warrants the investigation of mechanisms of differential growth phenotype due to loss of SAF1 and CTF8 together in presence of genotoxic stress in future.",

We cluster bouts that share common kinematic features and contribute to similar behavioral sequences into seven modules. Behavioral sequences comprising a subset of modules bring prey into the anterior dorsal visual field of the larvae. Fish then release a capture maneuver comprising a stereotyped jaw movement and fine-tuned stereotyped tail movements to capture prey at various distances. We demonstrate that changes to chaining dynamics, but not module production, underlie prey capture deficits in two visually impaired mutants. Our analysis thus reveals the temporal organization of a vertebrate hunting behavior, with the implication that different neural architectures underlie prey pursuit and capture.",

    "abstract": "Do mutations required for adaptation occur de novo, or are they segregating within populations as standing genetic variation? This question is key to understanding adaptive change in nature, and has important practical consequences for the evolution of drug resistance. We provide evidence that alleles conferring resistance to oxamniquine (OXA), an antischistosomal drug, are widespread in natural parasite populations under minimal drug pressure and predate OXA deployment. OXA has been used since the 1970s to treat Schistosoma mansoni infections in the New World where S. mansoni established during the slave trade. Recessive loss-of-function mutations within a parasite sulfotransferase (SmSULT-OR) underlie resistance, and several verified resistance mutations, including a deletion (p.E142del), have been identified in the New World. Here we investigate sequence variation in SmSULT-OR in S. mansoni from the Old World, where OXA has seen minimal usage. We sequenced exomes of 204 S. mansoni parasites from West Africa, East Africa and the Middle East, and scored variants in SmSULT-OR and flanking regions. We identified 39 non-synonymous SNPs, 4 deletions, 1 duplication and 1 premature stop codon in the SmSULT-OR coding sequence, including one confirmed resistance deletion (p.E142del). We expressed recombinant proteins and used an in vitro OXA activation assay to functionally validate the OXA-resistance phenotype for four predicted OXA-resistance mutations. Three aspects of the data are of particular interest: (i) segregating OXA-resistance alleles are widespread in Old World populations (4.29 - 14.91% frequency), despite minimal OXA usage, (ii) two OXA-resistance mutations (p.W120R, p.N171IfsX28) are particularly common (>5%) in East African and Middle-Eastern populations, (iii) the p.E142del allele has identical flanking SNPs in both West Africa and Puerto Rico, suggesting that parasites bearing this allele colonized the New World during the slave trade and therefore predate OXA deployment. We conclude that standing variation for OXA resistance is widespread in S. mansoni.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYIt has been argued that drug resistance is unlikely to spread rapidly in helminth parasites infecting humans. This is based, at least in part, on the premise that resistance mutations are rare or absent within populations prior to treatment, and take a long time to reach appreciable frequencies because helminth parasite generation time is long. This argument is critically dependent on the starting frequency of resistance alleles - if high levels of \\\"standing variation\\\" for resistance are present prior to deployment of treatment, resistance may spread rapidly. We examined frequencies of oxamniquine resistance alleles present in Schistosoma mansoni from Africa and the Middle East where oxamniquine has seen minimal use. We found that oxamniquine resistance alleles are widespread in the Old World, ranging from 4.29% in the Middle East to 14.91% in East African parasite populations. Furthermore, we show that resistance alleles from West African and the Caribbean schistosomes share a common origin, suggesting that these alleles travelled to the New World with S. mansoni during the transatlantic slave trade. Together, these results demonstrate extensive standing variation for oxamniquine resistance. Our results have important implications for both drug treatment policies and drug development efforts, and demonstrate the power of molecular surveillance approaches for guiding helminth control.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements are the DNA sequences capable of transpositions within the genome and, thus, exerting a considerable influence on the genome functioning and structure and providing the source of new genes. Transposable elements are classified into retrotransposons and the DNA transposons. IS630/Tc1/mariner superfamily of DNA transposons is one of the most diverse groups broadly represented among the eukaryotes. We identified a new group of Tc1-like elements in the mollusks, which we named TLEWI. These DNA transposons are characterized by the low copy number, the lack of terminal inverted repeats and the presence of DD36E signature and the spliceosomal introns in transposase sequence. Their prevalence among the mollusks is limited to subclass Pteriomorpha (Bivalvia). Since TLEWI possess the features of domesticated TE and the structure similar to the eukaryotic genes, which is not typical for the DNA transposons, we consider the hypothesis of co-optation of TLEWI gene by the bivalves.",

    "abstract": "Oomycetes include many well-studied, devastating plant pathogens. Across oomycete diversity, plant-infecting lineages are interspersed by non-pathogenic ones. Unfortunately, our understanding of the evolution of lifestyle switches is hampered by a scarcity of data on the molecular biology of saprotrophic oomycetes, ecologically important primary colonizers of dead tissue that can serve as informative reference points for understanding the evolution of pathogens. Here, we established Salisapilia sapeloensis growing on axenic litter as a tractable system for the study of saprotrophic oomycetes. We generated multiple transcriptomes from S. sapeloensis and compared them to (a) 22 oomycete genomes and (b) the transcriptomes of eight pathogenic oomycetes grown under 13 conditions (three pathogenic lifestyles, six hosts/substrates, and four tissues). From these analyses we obtained a global perspective on the gene expression signatures of oomycete lifestyles. Our data reveal that oomycete saprotrophs and pathogens use generally similar molecular mechanisms for colonization, but exhibit distinct expression patterns. We identify S. sapeloensis specific array and expression of carbohydrate-active enzymes and regulatory differences in pathogenicity-associated factors, including the virulence factor EpiC2B. Further, S. sapeloensis was found to express only a small repertoire of effector genes. In conclusion, our analyses reveal lifestyle-specific gene regulatory signatures and suggest that, in addition to variation in gene content, shifts in gene regulatory networks might underpin the evolution of oomycete lifestyles.",

    "abstract": "The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) harbors 11% of global malaria cases, yet little is known about the spatial and genetic structure of the parasite population in that country. We sequenced 2537 Plasmodium falciparum infections, including a nationally representative population sample from DRC and samples from surrounding countries, using molecular inversion probes - a novel high-throughput genotyping tool. We identified an east-west divide in haplotypes known to confer resistance to chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Furthermore, we identified highly related parasites over large geographic distances, indicative of gene flow and migration. Our results were consistent with a background of isolation by distance combined with the effects of selection for antimalarial drug resistance. This study provides a high-resolution view of parasite genetic structure across a large country in Africa and provides a baseline to study how implementation programs may impact parasite populations.",

    "abstract": "Although most activities of daily life require simultaneous coordination of both proximal and distal joints, motor preparation during such movements has not been well studied. Previous results for motor preparation have focused on hand/finger movements. For simple hand/finger movements, results have found that such movements typically evoke activity primarily in the contralateral motor cortices. However, increasing the complexity of the finger movements, such as during a distal sequential finger-pressing task, leads to additional recruitment of ipsilateral resources. It has been suggested that this involvement of the ipsilateral hemisphere is critical for temporal coordination of distal joints. The goal of the current study was to examine whether increasing simultaneous coordination of multiple joints (both proximal and distal) leads to a similar increase in coupling with ipsilateral sensorimotor cortices during motor preparation compared to a simple distal movement such as hand opening. To test this possibility, 12 healthy individuals participated in a high-density EEG experiment in which they performed either hand opening or simultaneous hand opening while lifting at the shoulder on a robotic device. We quantified within- and cross-frequency cortical coupling across the sensorimotor cortex for the two tasks using dynamic causal modeling. Both hand opening and simultaneous hand opening while lifting at the shoulder elicited coupling from secondary motor areas to primary motor cortex within the contralateral hemisphere exclusively in the beta band, as well as from ipsilateral primary motor cortex. However increasing the task complexity by combining hand opening while lifting at the shoulder also led to an increase in coupling within the ipsilateral hemisphere as well as interhemispheric coupling between hemispheres that expanded to theta, mu, and gamma frequencies. These findings demonstrate that increasing the demand of joint coordination between proximal and distal joints leads to increases in communication with the ipsilateral hemisphere as previously observed in distal sequential finger tasks.",

    "abstract": "Bridging genotype to phenotype, the proteome has increasingly become of major importance to generate large, longitudinal sample series for data-driven biology and personalized medicine. Major improvements in laboratory automation, chromatography and software have increased the scale and precision of proteomics. So far missing are however mass spectrometric acquisition techniques that could deal with very fast chromatographic gradients. Here we present scanning SWATH, a data-independent acquisition (DIA) method, in which the DIA-typical stepwise windowed acquisition is replaced by a continuous movement of the precursor isolation window. Scanning SWATH accelerates the duty cycles to a few hundreds of milliseconds, and enables precursor mass assignment to the MS2 fragment traces for improving true positive precursor identification in fast proteome experiments. In combination with 800 {micro}L/min high-flow chromatography, we report the quantification of 270 precursors per second, increasing the precursor identifications by 70% or more compared to previous methods. Scanning SWATH quantified 1,410 Human protein groups in conjunction with chromatographic gradients as fast as 30 seconds, 2,250 with 60-second gradients, and 4,586 in conjunction with 5-minute gradients. At high quantitative precision, our method hence increases the proteomic throughput to hundreds of samples per day per mass spectrometer. Scanning SWATH hence enables a broad range of new proteomic applications that depend on large numbers of cheap yet quantification precise proteomes.",
