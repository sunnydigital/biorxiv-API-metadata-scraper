    "abstract": "Alteration in hemodynamic shear stress at atheroprone sites promotes endothelial paracellular pore formation and permeability. Previously, we have reported that a peptide inhibitor to Nck prevented shear stress-induced p21 activated kinase (PAK) activation and endothelial permeability. However, the specificity of this peptide is unclear, and the role of individual Nck isoforms remain unknown. Here, we show that genetic deletion of Nck1/2 adaptor proteins significantly ameliorates shear stress induced permeability, and selective isoform depletion suggests distinct signaling mechanisms. Only Nck1 deletion significantly reduces flow-induced paracellular pore formation and permeability, whereas Nck2 depletion has no significant effects. Additionally, Nck1 reexpression, but not Nck2, restores shear stress-induced permeability in Nck1/2 knockout cells, confirming the non-compensating roles. In vivo, using the partial carotid ligation model of disturbed flow, Nck1 knockout prevented the increase in vascular permeability, as assessed by both Evans blue extravasation and leakage of plasma fibrinogen into the vessel wall. Domain swap experiments mixing SH2 (phosphotyrosine binding) and SH3 (proline rich binding) domains between Nck1 and Nck2 showed a dispensable role for SH2 domains but a critical role for the Nck1 SH3 domains in rescuing shear stress-induced endothelial permeability. Consistent with this, both Nck1 and Nck2 bind to PECAM-1 (SH2 dependent) in response to shear stress, but only Nck1 ablation interferes with shear stress-induced PAK2 activation (SH3 dependent). This work provides the first evidence that Nck1 and Nck2 play distinct roles in flow-induced vascular permeability.\\n\\nNew and NoteworthyThe present study shows a specific role for Nck1 in endothelial permeability in response to shear stress. Using in vitro and in vivo models, we demonstrate improvement in endothelial barrier integrity in cells subjected to disturbed flow only following Nck1 but not Nck2 deletion. Selective Nck1 inhibition may limit endothelial permeability at sites of disturbed flow to reduce atherosclerosis without affecting angiogenesis, which requires both Nck1 and Nck2 inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Striatal projection neurons, the medium spiny neurons (MSNs), play a crucial role in various motor and cognitive functions. MSNs express either D1 or D2 type dopamine receptors and initiate the direct-pathway (dMSNs) or indirect pathways (iMSNs) of the basal ganglia, respectively. dMSNs have been shown to receive more inhibition than iMSNs from intrastriatal sources. Based on these findings, computational modelling of the striatal network has predicted that under healthy conditions dMSNs should receive more excitatory input than iMSNs. To test this prediction, we analyzed in vivo whole-cell recordings from dMSNs and iMSNs in healthy and dopamine-depleted (6OHDA) anaesthetized mice. By comparing their membrane potential fluctuations, we found that dMSNs exhibited considerably larger membrane potential fluctuations over a wide frequency range. Furthermore, by comparing the spike-triggered average membrane potentials, we found that dMSNs depolarized towards the spike threshold significantly faster than iMSNs did. Together, these finding corroborate the theoretical prediction that direct-pathway MSNs receive stronger input than indirect-pathway neurons. Finally, we found that dopamine-depleted mice exhibited no difference between the membrane potential fluctuations of dMSNs and iMSNs. These data provide new insights into the question how a lack of dopamine may lead to behavior deficits associated with Parkinsons disease.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe direct and indirect pathways of the basal ganglia originate from the D1 and D2 type dopamine receptor expressing medium spiny neurons (dMSNs and iMSNs), respectively. To understand the role of the striatum in brain function and dysfunction it is important to characterize the differences in synaptic inputs to the two MSN types. Theoretical results predicted that dMSNs should receive stronger excitatory input than iMSNs. Here, we studied membrane potential fluctuation statistics of MSNs recorded in vivo in anaesthetized mice and found that dMSNs, indeed, received stronger synaptic input than iMSNs. We corroborated this finding by spike-triggered membrane potential analysis, showing that dMSNs spiking required more synaptic input than iMSNs spiking did, as had been predicted by computational models.",

    "abstract": "Whether and how personality traits explain the individual variance in neural responses to emotion in music remains unclear. The sparse studies on this topic report inconsistent findings. The present study extends previous work using regions of variance (ROVs) as regions of interest, compared with whole-brain analysis. Fifty-five subjects listened to happy, sad, and fearful music during functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Personality was measured with the Big Five Questionnaire. Results confirmed previous observations of Neuroticism being positively related to activation during sad music, in the left inferior parietal lobe. In an exploratory analysis, Openness was positively related to activation during Happy music in an extended cluster in auditory areas, primarily including portions of the left Heschls gyrus, superior and middle temporal gyri, supramarginal gyrus, and Rolandic operculum. In the whole-brain analysis, similar results were found for Neuroticism but not for Openness. In turn, we did not replicate previous findings of Extraversion associated to activity during happy music, nor Neuroticism during fearful music. These results support a trait-congruent link between personality and emotion-elicited brain activity, and further our understanding of the action-observation network during emotional music listening. This study also indicates the usefulness of the ROV method in individual-differences research.",

    "abstract": "While Granger Causality (GC) has been often employed in network neuroscience, most GC applications are based on linear multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) models. However, real-life systems like biological networks exhibit notable non-linear behavior, hence undermining the validity of MVAR-based GC (MVAR-GC). Current nonlinear GC estimators only cater for additive nonlinearities or, alternatively, are based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) or Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, which present considerable training difficulties and tailoring needs. We define a novel approach to estimating nonlinear, directed within-network interactions through a RNN class termed echo-state networks (ESN), where training is replaced by random initialization of an internal basis based on orthonormal matrices. We reformulate the GC framework in terms of ESN-based models, our ESN-based Granger Causality (ES-GC) estimator in a network of noisy Duffing oscillators, showing a net advantage of ES-GC in detecting nonlinear, causal links. We then explore the structure of ES-GC networks in the human brain employing functional MRI data from 1003 healthy subjects drawn from the human connectome project, demonstrating the existence of previously unknown directed within-brain interactions. ES-GC performs better than commonly used and recently developed GC approaches, making it a valuable tool for the analysis of e.g. multivariate biological networks.",

    "abstract": "Cocaine is known to increase the extracellular levels of dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) by inhibiting the neuronal reuptake of these monoamines. However, individuals with reduced monoamine reuptake transporter expression do not display a reduction in cocaine intake, suggesting that a mechanism other than inhibition of monoamine reuptake contributes to the rewarding and addictive effects of the psychostimulant. Here we report that cocaine depletes the dopaminergic and serotonergic storage vesicles of the rat nucleus accumbens. This cocaine-induced vesicle depletion gave rise to acute increases in the extracellular levels of DA and 5-HT, which in turn correlated with monoamine-type-specific changes in behavior. Both the neurochemical and behavioral responses to cocaine varied among individual animals, which was not due to individual differences in the reuptake of DA and 5-HT, but rather to individual differences in their vesicular release. Furthermore, we found that reserpine-induced depletion of storage vesicles reduced both short and long access cocaine self-administration, and the degree of reduction was linked to the vesicular storage capacity of the animals. In conclusion, we demonstrate a novel mechanism by which cocaine increases the extracellular concentrations of accumbal DA and 5-HT, namely via release from storage vesicles. Furthermore, individual differences in cocaine-induced vesicular monoamine release shape individual differences in not only the acute behavioral and neurochemical effects of the stimulant, but also in its intake. Thus, intracellular storage vesicles represent an attractive novel drug target to combat psychostimulant addiction.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAccurate medication reconciliation in trauma patients is essential but difficult. Currently there is no established clinical method of detecting direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in trauma patients. We hypothesized that a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) based assay can be used to accurately detect DOACs in trauma patients upon hospital arrival.\\n\\nMethodsPlasma samples were collected from 356 patients who provided informed consent including-10 healthy controls, 19 known positive or negative controls and 327 trauma patients over 65 years of age who were evaluated at our large, urban Level 1 Trauma Center. The assay methodology was developed in healthy and known controls to detect apixaban, rivaroxaban and dabigatran using LCMS and then applied to 327 samples from trauma patients. Standard medication reconciliation processes in the electronic medical record documenting DOAC usage was compared with LCMS results to determine overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) of the assay.\\n\\nResultsOf 356 patients, 39 were on DOACs (10.96%): 21 were on Apixaban, 14 on rivaroxaban and 4 on dabigatran. The overall accuracy of the assay for detecting any DOAC was 98.60%, with a sensitivity of 94.87% and specificity of 99.06%, (PPV 92.50% and NPV 99.37%). The assay detected apixaban with a sensitivity of 90.48% and specificity of 99.11% (PPV 86.36% and NPV 99.40%). There were three false positive results and two false negative LCMS results for apixaban. Dabigatran and rivaroxaban were detected with 100% sensitivity and specificity.\\n\\nConclusionsThis LCMS-based assay was highly accurate in detecting DOACs in trauma patients. Further studies need to confirm the clinical efficacy of this LCMS assay and its value for medication reconciliation in trauma patients.\\n\\nStudy type: diagnostic test\\n\\nBasic Science paper: therefore does not require a level of evidence.",

    "abstract": "Varieties and soil moisture content are the two agronomic factors mostly pointed out as influencers of cyanogenic glucoside production in cassava. The role of soil nutrient supply is however often overlooked or minimised, despite its known influence on cyanogenic glucoside production. A pot experiment was hence carried out to determine whether soil nutrient supply had an equal influence on cyanogenic glucoside production in cassava, as varieties and soil moisture content. The cassava varieties, Kiroba (a sweet cassava variety) and Salanga (a bitter cassava variety), were used in the experiment, together with three soil moisture treatments that respectively induced severe moisture stress, moderate moisture stress and no moisture stress (optimal soil moisture conditions where plants were kept well-watered). The soil nutrient treatments used depicted conditions of low (no fertiliser), moderate (25 N mg, 5 P mg, 25 K mg /kg) and high (25 N mg, 5 P mg, 25 K mg /kg) nutrient supply. A sole K treatment was also included (25 K mg/kg). Total hydrogen cyanide (HCN) levels in cassava leaves were used to indicate the effects of the three factors on cyanogenic glucoside production. The results of the study showed that nutrient supply had a significantly (p < 0.001) equal influence on cyanogenic glucoside production, as varieties (p < 0.001) and soil moisture content (p < 0.001). Cyanogenic glucoside production was however found to be differently influenced by soil moisture content (M) and nutrient supply (N) in both Salanga (MxN, p = 0.002) and Kiroba (MxN, p < 0.001). Leaf HCN levels of unfertilised Salanga and Kiroba were respectively increased by 1.8 times and 2.7 times their levels under optimal soil moisture conditions. Thus, under severe moisture stress, low soil fertility was found to have an increasing effect on leaf HCN levels in both varieties. A high supply of N, P and K, however also had an increasing effect on leaf HCN in both varieties regardless of soil moisture conditions. Leaf HCN levels in Salanga ranged from 95.5 mg/kg to 334.5 mg/kg and in Kiroba they ranged from 39.3 mg/kg to 161.5 mg/kg, on a fresh weight basis. The study managed to demonstrate that soil fertility had an equally important influence on cyanogenic glucoside production, just like varieties and soil moisture content. The study also showed that the effects of nutrient supply on cyanogenic glucoside production in various cassava varieties is dependent on changes in soil moisture content and vice versa.",

    "abstract": "Exercise training is a powerful means to combat metabolic pathologies. Mice are extensively used to describe the benefits of exercise, but mild cold stress induced by housing temperatures may confound translation to humans. Thermoneutral housing is a strategy to make mice more metabolically similar to humans but its effects on exercise adaptations are unknown. Using voluntary wheel running, we show that thermoneutral housing blunted exercise-induced improvements in insulin action in muscle and adipose tissue. Moreover, thermoneutrality reduced the effects of training on energy expenditure, body composition, muscle and adipose tissue protein expressions, and the gut microbiome. The majority of these thermoneutral-dependent training adaptations could not be ascribed to a lower voluntary running volume. Thus, we conclude that organismal adaptations to exercise training in mice critically depend upon housing temperature. Our findings underscore the importance of housing temperature as an important parameter in the design and interpretation of murine exercise studies.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIHousing at 30{degrees}C blunts several adaptations to exercise training in mice\\nC_LIO_LIExercise-sensitive protein induction is dampened at 30{degrees}C in skeletal muscle\\nC_LIO_LI30{degrees}C-housing blunts training-induced increase in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake\\nC_LIO_LIGlucose tolerance is not improved by voluntary exercise training at 30{degrees}C housing\\nC_LIO_LIDecreased running in 30{degrees}C housing is not due to overheating\\nC_LI\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/651588v1_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (68K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e5b6acorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3be37corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d3febborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f8da30_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical abstract\\n\\nC_FIG",

Hi-C data and a high-density genetic map allowed us to anchor and orient 87% of the sequence on the 17 chromosomes of the pear genome. About 50% (247 Mb) of the genome consists of repetitive sequences. Comparison with previous assemblies of Pyrus communis. and Pyrus x bretschneideri confirmed the presence of 37,445 protein-coding genes, which is 13% fewer than previously predicted.",

    "abstract": "Root morphology and exudation define a plants sphere of influence in soils, and are in turn shaped by the physiochemical characteristics of soil. We explored how particle size and chemistry of growth substrates affect root morphology and exudation of the model grass Brachypodium distachyon. Root fresh weight and root lengths were correlated with particle size, whereas root number and shoot weight remained constant. Mass spectrometry imaging suggested that both, root length and number shape root exudation. Exudate metabolite profiles detected with liquid chromatography / mass spectrometry were comparable for plants growing in glass beads or sand with various particles sizes, but distinct for plants growing in clay. However, when exudates of clay-grown plants were collected by removing the plants from the substrate, their exudate profile was similar to sand- or glass beads-grown plants. Clay particles sorbed 20% of compounds exuded by clay-grown plants, and 70% of compounds of a defined exudate medium. The sorbed compounds belonged to a range of chemical classes, among them nucleosides/nucleotides, organic acids, sugars, and amino acids. Some of the sorbed compounds could be de-sorbed by a rhizobacterium (Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS415), supporting its growth. We show that root morphology is affected by substrate size, and that root exudation in contrast is not affected by substrate size or chemistry. The availability of exuded compounds, however, depends on the substrate present. These findings further support the critical importance of the physiochemical properties of soils are crucial to consider when investigating plant morphology, exudation, and plant-microbe interactions.",

Despite the existence of powerful methods and software in ancestral character state inference, difficulties may arise when interpreting the outputs of such inferences. The growing complexity of data (trees, annotations), the diversity of optimization criteria for computing trees and ancestral character states, the combinatorial explosion of potential evolutionary scenarios if some ancestral characters states do not stand out clearly from others, requires the design of new methods that operate on tree topologies and extrinsic traits associations to ease the identification of evolutionary scenarios.\\n\\nResultWe developed a tool, PastView, a user-friendly interface that includes numerical and graphical features to help users to import and/or compute ancestral character states and extract evolutionary scenario as a set of successive transitions of ancestral character states from the tree root to its leaves. PastView offers synthetic views such as transition maps and integrates comparative analysis methods to highlight agreements or discrepancies between methods of ancestral annotations inference.\\n\\nConclusionThe main contribution of PastView is to assemble known numerical and graphical methods into a multi-maps graphical user interface dedicated to the computing, searching and viewing of evolutionary scenarios based on phylogenetic trees and ancestral character states.

While an effective CRISPR homing gene drive for population suppression has recently been demonstrated in mosquitoes, formation of resistance alleles that prevent Cas9 cleavage remains the major obstacle for drive strategies aiming at population modification, rather than elimination. Here, we present a homing drive in Drosophila melanogaster that reduces resistance allele formation below detectable levels by targeting a haplolethal gene with two gRNAs while also providing a rescue allele. This is because any resistance alleles that form by end-joining repair will typically disrupt the haplolethal target gene, rendering the individuals carrying them nonviable. We demonstrate that our drive is highly efficient, with 91% of the progeny of drive heterozygotes inheriting the drive allele and with no resistance alleles observed in the remainder. In a large cage experiment, the drive allele successfully spread to all individuals. These results show that a haplolethal homing drive can be a highly effective tool for population modification.",

    "abstract": "Formation of proteinaceous deposits composed of abnormally aggregated proteins characterizes a range of pathological conditions. Proteinaceous inclusions detected in the neurodegenerative conditions such Huntingtons chorea (HD) and Alzheimers disease (AD) are often referred as pathognomic and regarded as causally implicated. Despite of differences in aetiology and underlying genetics, rare cases of combined HD and AD were reported and described as admixed proteinopathies. Mixed proteopathies are characterized by the co-occurrence of at least two types of abnormal aggregation-prone variants; pathological deposition of proteinaceous inclusions might however, affect different cell populations. Here, combining plaques derived from human {beta}-amyloid with mutant HTT-like polyglutamine inclusions in a cell-autonomous manner, we report on the Caenorhabditis elegans model for admixed proteinopathy of Alzheimers and Huntingtons type. We show both types of intracellular foci are formed in vivo: non-amyloidic extended polyglutamine derived inclusions and distinguish those from the presence of mature {beta}- amyloid fibers. We found that polyglutamines expanded above pathogenic threshold and {beta}-amyloid act synergistically to promote the progression of proteotoxicity in a temperature dependent manner. We further, implicate the hsp-1 (the predominant C. elegans chaperone interacting with ER-routed A{beta}42) modulate the proteotoxic insults observed in combined proteopathy model. Our results demonstrate how the in vivo model of admixed proteopathy could be utilized to probe for human pathogenic variants confined to the same cellular type. In that perspective expanded aggregation-prone polyglutamines appended with fluorescent proteins could be regarded as  pathogenic probes useful in the proteotoxicity assays i.e. involving {beta}-amyloid and possibly other comparable models of disease-associated aggregation prone variants.We anticipate models of combined proteopathies will be informative regarding the underlying pathogenesis and provide the sensitized background for sophisticated screening. For example the combinatorial effects of multiple pathogenic aggregation-prone variants could be tested against mutant backgrounds and pharmacological compounds. Furthermore, we surmise the postulated synergistic actions might explain some of the overlaps in observed progression of clinical symptoms in HD and AD. We also formulate the conjecture regarding the polyQ containing proteins as a contributing factor in degenerative conditions associated with increased {beta}-amyloid formation and deposition.",

    "abstract": "This paper offers a formal account of policy learning, or habitual behavioural optimisation, under the framework of Active Inference. In this setting, habit formation becomes an autodidactic, experience-dependent process, based upon what the agent sees itself doing. We focus on the effect of environmental volatility on habit formation by simulating artificial agents operating in a partially observable Markov decision process. Specifically, we used a  two-step maze paradigm, in which the agent has to decide whether to go left or right to secure a reward. We observe that in volatile environments with numerous reward locations, the agents learn to adopt a generalist strategy, never forming a strong habitual behaviour for any preferred maze direction. Conversely, in conservative or static environments, agents adopt a specialist strategy; forming strong preferences for policies that result in approach to a small number of previously-observed reward locations. The pros and cons of the two strategies are tested and discussed. In general, specialization offers greater benefits, but only when contingencies are conserved over time. We consider the implications of this formal (Active Inference) account of policy learning for understanding the relationship between specialisation and habit formation.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryActive inference is a theoretical framework that formalizes the behaviour of any organism in terms of a single imperative - to minimize surprise. Starting from this principle, we can construct simulations of simple \\\"agents\\\" (artificial organisms) that show the ability to infer causal relationships and learn. Here, we expand upon currently-existing implementations of Active Inference by enabling synthetic agents to optimise the space of behavioural policies that they can pursue. Our results show that by adapting the probabilities of certain action sequences (which may correspond biologically to the phenomenon of synaptic plasticity), and by rejecting improbable sequences (synaptic pruning), the agents can begin to form habits. Furthermore, we have shown our agents habit formation to be environment-dependent. Some agents become specialised to a constant environment, while other adopt a more general strategy, each with sensible pros and cons. This work has potential applications in computational psychiatry, including in behavioural phenotyping to better understand disorders.",

    "abstract": "Biological networks often have complex structure consisting of meaningful clusters of nodes that are integral to understanding biological function. Community detection algorithms to identify the clustering, or community structure, of a network have been well established. These algorithms assume that data used in network construction is observed without error. However, oftentimes intermediary analyses such as regression are performed before constructing biological networks and the associated error is not propagated in community detection. In expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) networks, one must first map eQTLs via linear regression in order to specify the matrix representation of the network. We study the effects of using estimates from regression models when applying the spectral clustering approach to community detection. We demonstrate the impacts on the affinity matrix and consider adjusted estimates of the affinity matrix for use in spectral clustering. We further provide a recommendation for selection of the tuning parameter in spectral clustering. We evaluate the proposed adjusted method for performing spectral clustering to detect gene clusters in eQTL data from the GTEx project and to assess the stability of communities in biological data.",

    "abstract": "Substantial morphological and behavioral shifts often accompany rapid environmental change, yet, little is known about the early stages of cave colonization. Relative to surface streams, caves are extreme environments with perpetual darkness and low nutrient availability. The Mexican tetra (Astyanax mexicanus), has repeatedly colonized caves throughout Mexico, suggesting an ability to adapt to these conditions. Here, we survey for phenotypic and behavioral differences between a surface population and a cave population of A. mexicanus that has recently colonized Honey Creek Cave, Comal County, Texas, likely within the last century. We found that fish from Honey Creek Cave and fish from Honey Creek surface populations differ significantly in morphological traits including length, coloration, body condition, eye size, and dorsal fin placement. Cavefish also exhibit an increased number of superficial neuromasts relative to surface fish. Behaviorally, cavefish consume fewer worms when trials are performed in both lighted and darkened conditions. Cavefish are more aggressive than surface fish and exhibit fewer behaviors associated with stress. Further in contrast to surface fish, cavefish prefer the edges to the center of an arena and are qualitatively more likely to investigate a novel object placed in the tank. While cavefish and surface fish were wild-caught and developmental environment likely play a role in shaping these differences, our work demonstrates morphological and behavioral shifts for Texas cavefish and offers an exciting opportunity for future work to explore the genetic and environmental contributions to early cave colonization.",

    "abstract": "Neuropixels probes present exciting new opportunities for neuroscience, but such large-scale high-density recordings also introduce unprecedented challenges in data analysis. Neuropixels data usually consist of hundreds or thousands of long stretches of sequential spiking activities that evolve non-stationarily over time and are often governed by complex, unknown dynamics. Extracting meaningful information from the Neuropixels recordings is a non-trial task. Here we introduce a general-purpose, graph-based statistical framework that, without imposing any parametric assumptions, detects points in time at which population spiking activity exhibits simultaneous changes as well as changes that only occur in a subset of the neural population, referred to as \\\"change-points\\\". The sequence of change-point events can be interpreted as a footprint of neural population activities, which allows us to relate behavior to simultaneously recorded high-dimensional neural activities across multiple brain regions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with an analysis of Neuropixels recordings during spontaneous behavior of an awake mouse in darkness. We observe that change-point dynamics in some brain regions display biologically interesting patterns that hint at functional pathways, as well as temporally-precise coordination with behavioral dynamics. We hypothesize that neural activities underlying spontaneous behavior, though distributed brainwide, show evidences for network modularity. Moreover, we envision the proposed framework to be a useful off-the-shelf analysis tool to the neuroscience community as new electrophysiological recording techniques continue to drive an explosive proliferation in the number and size of data sets.",

    "abstract": "Modulatory (e.g. dopaminergic) neurons provide \\\"teaching signals\\\" that drive associative learning across the animal kingdom, but the circuits that regulate their activity and compute teaching signals are still poorly understood. We provide the first synaptic-resolution connectome of the circuitry upstream of all modulatory neurons in a brain center for associative learning, the mushroom body (MB) of the Drosophila larva. We discovered afferent pathways from sensory neurons, as well as an unexpected large population of 61 feedback neuron pairs that provide one- and two-step feedback from MB output neurons. The majority of these feedback pathways link distinct memory systems (e.g. aversive and appetitive). We functionally confirmed some of the structural pathways and found that some modulatory neurons compare inhibitory input from their own compartment and excitatory input from compartments of opposite valence, enabling them to compute integrated common-currency predicted values across aversive and appetitive memory systems. This architecture suggests that the MB functions as an interconnected ensemble during learning and that distinct types of previously formed memories can regulate future learning about a stimulus. We developed a model of the circuit constrained by the connectome and by the functional data which revealed that the newly discovered architectural motifs, namely the multilevel feedback architecture and the extensive cross-compartment connections, increase the computational performance and flexibility on learning tasks. Together our study provides the most detailed view to date of a recurrent brain circuit that computes teaching signals and provides insights into the architectural motifs that support reinforcement learning in a biological system.",

Although the symbiont has been studied in detail on the molecular level, such analyses were unavailable for the animal host, because sequence information was lacking. To identify host-symbiont interaction mechanisms, we therefore sequenced the Riftia transcriptome, which enabled comparative metaproteomic analyses of symbiont-containing versus symbiont-free tissues, both under energy-rich and energy-limited conditions. We demonstrate that metabolic interactions include nutrient allocation from symbiont to host by symbiont digestion, and substrate transfer to the symbiont by abundant host proteins. Our analysis further suggests that Riftia maintains its symbiont by protecting the bacteria from oxidative damage, while also exerting symbiont population control. Eukaryote-like symbiont proteins might facilitate intracellular symbiont persistence. Energy limitation apparently leads to reduced symbiont biomass and increased symbiont digestion. Our study provides unprecedented insights into host-microbe interactions that shape this highly efficient symbiosis.",

    "abstract": "Interaction of {beta}-arrestins ({beta}arrs) upon agonist-stimulation is a hallmark of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) resulting in receptor desensitization, endocytosis and signaling. Although overall functional roles of {beta}arrs are typically believed to be conserved across different receptors, emerging data now clearly unveils receptor-specific functional contribution of {beta}arrs. The underlying mechanism however remains mostly speculative and represents a key missing link in our current understanding of GPCR signaling and regulatory paradigms. Here, we develop synthetic intrabody-based conformational sensors that help us visualize the assembly and trafficking of GPCR-{beta}arr1 complexes in cellular context for a broad set of receptors with spatio-temporal resolution. Surprisingly, these conformational sensors reveal a previously unappreciated level of diversity in GPCR-{beta}arr complexes that extends beyond the current framework of affinity-based classification and phosphorylation-code-based interaction patterns. More importantly, this conformational diversity arising from spatial signature of phosphorylation sites manifests directly in the form of distinct functional outcomes, including even opposite contribution of {beta}arrs in signal-transduction for different receptors. Taken together, these findings uncover that despite an overall similar interaction and trafficking patterns; critical structural and functional differences exist in {beta}arr complexes for different GPCRs that define and fine-tune receptor-specific downstream responses.",

    "abstract": "Natural Killer (NK) cells provide important protection from cancer and are a key requirement for particular immunotherapies. In activated NK cells, a metabolic response towards increased glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation is crucial for NK cell effector functions. However, there is accumulating evidence that NK cells become dysfunctional during chronic inflammatory diseases, such as human breast cancer. This dysfunction is apparent in peripheral blood NK cells and can impact on normal NK cell immune responses and their effective targeting during immunotherapy. Herein, we demonstrate that prolonged cytokine stimulation combined with metabolic restriction, through inhibition of mTORC1, is sufficient to induce persistent dysfunction in human NK cells. TGF{beta}, also restricted NK cell metabolism and promoted persistent NK cell dysfunction. NK cells from patients with metastatic breast cancer had profound metabolic defects in glycolysis and mitochondrial function, and clear structural differences in NK cell mitochondrial morphology. Importantly, blocking elevated TGF{beta} improved readouts of metabolism and restored IFN{gamma} production in patient NK cells.",

    "abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the US. Although the current recommended Lyme antibiotic treatment can cure the majority of Lyme disease patients, about 10-20% patients continue to suffer from persisting symptoms. There have been various anecdotal reports on the use of herbal extracts for treating patients with persisting symptoms with varying degree of improvements. However, it is unclear whether the effect of the herb products is due to their direct antimicrobial activity or their effect on host immune system. In the present study, we investigated the antimicrobial effects of 12 commonly used botanical medicines and 3 other natural antimicrobial agents for potential anti-Borrelia burgdorferi activity in vitro. Primary criteria for selecting compounds for the present study included agents that had shown significant anti-borrelial effects in previous studies, have favorable safety profiles, and can be absorbed systemically. Among them, 9 natural product extracts at 1% were found to have good activity against the stationary phase B. burgdorferi culture compared to the control antibiotics doxycycline and cefuroxime. These active herbs include Cryptolepis sanguinolenta, Juglans nigra (Black walnut), Polygonum cuspidatum (Japanese knotweed), Artemesia annua (Sweet wormwood), Uncaria tomentosa (Cats claw), Cistus incanus, and Scutellaria baicalensis (Chinese skullcap). In contrast, Stevia rebaudiana, Andrographis paniculata, Grapefruit seed extract, colloidal silver, monolaurin, and antimicrobial peptide LL37 had little or no activity against stationary phase B. burgdorferi. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of Artemesia annua, Juglans nigra, and Uncaria tomentosa were quite high for growing B. burgdorferi, despite their strong activity against the non-growing stationary phase B. burgdorferi cells. On the other hand, the top two active herbs, Cryptolepis sanguinolenta and Polygonum cuspidatum, showed strong activity against both growing B. burgdorferi (MIC=0.03%-0.06% and 0.25%-0.5% respectively) and non-growing stationary phase B. burgdorferi. In subculture studies, only 1% Cryptolepis sanguinolenta extract caused complete eradication, while current Lyme antibiotics doxycycline and cefuroxime and other active herbs including Polygonum cuspidatum, Artemesia annua, Juglans nigra and Uncaria tomentosa could not eradicate B. burgdorferi stationary phase cells as many spirochetes were visible after 21-day subculture. Further studies are needed to identify the active ingredients of the effective herbs and evaluate their combinations for more effective eradication of B. burgdorferi in vitro and in vivo. The implications of these findings for more effective treatment of persistent Lyme disease are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Sample type and preservation methods are likely to influence microbiome analysis results. Relatively few studies have explored the differences between feces and gut as well as ethanol-stored and frozen samples. Here, we sampled the same individuals of three aquatic vertebrates from the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau non-invasively for feces, and subsequently for hindgut through dissection. Our study species, two fishes (Gymnocypris cf. namensis and Triplophysa sp.) and one amphibian (tadpoles of Nanorana parkeri), were all collected at the same time and site. Gut and fecal samples were stored in ethanol, and additionally, part of the gut samples were frozen, but temporarily thawed during transport as it often happens under difficult field conditions. Our results showed that both substrate (gut content vs. feces) as well as preservation method can influence the analysis of intestinal microbiomes. Frozen gut samples strongly differed from ethanol-stored samples, and especially in Nanorana most frozen samples were dominated (in relative abundance) by a set of Proteobacteria OTUs that were completely absent from the ethanol-stored samples. This blooming of contaminant bacteria occurred after less than 12 h of thawing, thus caution should be taken when constancy of cold temperatures cannot be maintained in the field for sample preservation purposes. Among ethanol-stored samples, bacterial communities from feces differed from those recovered from guts, but in part recovered similar patterns, such as a higher bacterial richness in the more herbivorous Nanorana tadpoles. Although our results argue against combining gut and fecal samples in analyses of host-specific microbiome differences, they also confirm that non-invasive sampling of feces can provide useful information of gut microbiomes in aquatic vertebrates, which may be important especially when working with endangered species.",

These two systems can be modeled using model-based (MB) and model-free (MF) algorithms in Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework. Here, we study the link between the contribution of these two learning systems to behavior and meta-cognitive capabilities. Using computational modeling we showed that in a highly variable environment, where both learning strategies have chance level performances, model-free learning predicts higher confidence in decisions compared to model-based strategy. Our experimental results showed that the subjects meta-cognitive ability is negatively correlated with the contribution of model-free system to their behavior while having no correlation with the contribution of model-based system. Over-confidence of the model-free system justifies this counter-intuitive result. This is a new explanation for individual difference in learning style.",

    "abstract": "Although the lung is an obvious target for site-specific delivery of many therapeutics for respiratory airway diseases such as asthma, COPD, and cystic fibrosis, novel strategies are needed to avoid key physiologic barriers for efficient delivery and controlled release of therapeutics to the lungs. Specifically, deposition into the deep lung requires particles with a 1-5 {micro}m aerodynamic diameter; however, particles with a geometric diameter less than 6 {micro}m are rapidly cleared by alveolar macrophages. Additionally, epithelial, endothelial, and fibroblast cells prefer smaller (< 300 nm) nanoparticles for efficient endocytosis. Here we address these contradictory design requirements by using a nanoparticle-inside-microgel system (Nano-in-Microgel). Using an improved maleimide-thiol based Michael Addition during (water-in-oil) Emulsion (MADE) method, we fabricated both trypsin-responsive and neutrophil elastase-responsive polymeric Nano-in-Microgel to show the versatility of the system in easily exchanging enzyme-responsive crosslinkers for disease-specific proteases. By varying the initial macromer concentration, from 20-50 % w/v, the size distribution means ranged from 4-8 {micro}m, enzymatic degradation of the microgels is within 30 minutes, and in vitro macrophage phagocytosis is lower for the higher % w/v. We further demonstrated that in vivo lung delivery of the multi-stage carriers through the pulmonary route yields particle retention up to several hours and followed by clearance within in naive mice. Our results provide a further understanding of how enzymatically-degradable multi-stage polymeric carriers can be used for pulmonary drug delivery.\\n\\nGraphical Abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=60 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/650911v2_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (15K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dcd1dcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@55e23eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@788c02org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@30161f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "To ensure a physicochemically desired sequence motif to adapt a specific type of secondary structures, we compile an -helix database allowing complicate search patterns to facilitate a data-driven design of therapeutic peptides. Nearly 1.7 million helical peptides in >130 thousand proteins are extracted along with their interacting partners from the protein data bank (PDB). The sequences of the peptides are indexed with patterns and gaps and deposited in our Therapeutic Peptide Design dataBase (TP-DB). We here demonstrate its utility in three medicinal design cases. By our pattern-based search engine but not PHI-BLAST, we can identify a pathogenic protein, Helicobacter pylori neutrophil-activating protein (HP-NAP), a virulence factor of H. pylori, which contains a motif DYKYLE that belongs to the affinity determinant motif DYKXX[DE] of the FLAG-tag and can be recognized by the anti-FLAG M2 antibody. By doing so, the known purification-tag-specific antibody is repurposed into a diagnostic kit for H. pylori. Also by leveraging TP-DB, we discovered a stretch of helical peptide matching the potent membrane-insertion pattern WXXWXXW, elucidated by MD simulations. The newly synthesized peptide has a better minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and much lower cytotoxicity against Candida albicans (fungus) than that of previously characterized homologous antimicrobial peptides. In a similar vein, taking the discontinued anchoring residues in the helix-helix interaction interface as the search pattern, TP-DB returns several helical peptides as potential tumor suppressors of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) whose helicity and binding affinity were examined by MD simulations. Taken together, we believe that TP-DB and its pattern-based search engine provide a new opportunity for a (secondary-)structure-based design of peptide drugs and diagnostic kits for pathogens without inferring evolutionary homology between sequences sharing the same pattern.

    "abstract": "Papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC) is a malignant kidney cancer with a prevalence of 7-20% of all renal tumors. Proteome and metabolome profiles of 19 pRCC and patient-matched healthy kidney controls were used to elucidate the regulation of metabolic pathways and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Glutathione (GSH), a main reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, was highly increased and can be regarded as a new hallmark in this malignancy. Isotope tracing of pRCC derived cell lines revealed an increased de novo synthesis rate of GSH, based on glutamine consumption. Furthermore, rewiring of the main pathways involved in ATP and glucose synthesis was observed at the protein level. In contrast, transcripts encoding for the respiratory chain were not regulated, which prompts for non-genetic profiling. The molecular characteristics of pRCC are increased GSH synthesis to cope with ROS stress, deficient anabolic glucose synthesis, and compromised oxidative phosphorylation, which could potentially be exploited in innovative anti-cancer strategies.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWe applied proteome- and metabolome profiling to elucidate molecular features in malign papillary renal cell carcinomas. By this characterization, a reprogramming of the main metabolic pathways, such as gluconeogenesis and fatty acid- and amino acid metabolism were identified. The proteins involved in the respiratory chain and the corresponding enzymatic activities were strongly reduced in pRCC, showing an anti-correlation compared with the transcriptome. Similar to renal oncocytomas, the ROS scavenger glutathione was identified as a hallmark in pRCC. Our results suggest that impaired metabolism and dysfunctional mitochondria determine the fate of pRCC. Furthermore, we propose that the specific regulation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain can differentiate highly similar malignant pRCCs from benign renal oncocytomas.",

    "abstract": "The fire-bellied toad (Bombina bombina) is a small amphibian species inhabiting the lowlands of Central and Eastern Europe. Continual population fragmentation has caused a decrease in genetic diversity and gene flow in margin populations in Northern Germany. Previous research using mitochondrial control region data uncovered a translocation of allochthonous toads from Austria into a single northern German population, Hogsdorf. Microsatellite and MHC data also confirmed this introgression, but were limited in revealing the true extent of this translocation for all investigated populations. Here, we utilize complete mitochondrial genomes and nuclear data, in the form of transcriptomes, to unravel the full extent of admixture from this translocation. The increased number of loci enabled us to uncover signs of introgression in four out of the five northern populations investigated. Moreover, as hybrids between B. bombina and its sister species, B. variegata, have been reported in Austria, we also investigated whether B. variegata alleles were translocated into the northern gene pool. We found evidence for hybridization between Austrian B. bombina and B. variegata, as well as traces of B. variegata alleles in one of the five German populations included in this study. These findings present the first reported case of introgressed relict B. variegata alleles from the Southern lineage being detected in Northern Germany.",

Cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) responses were evoked by optogenetic stimulation of cortical PV interneurons and pyramidal neurons. We found that CMRO2 responses depended on neuronal activation, but not on the power of gamma activity induced by optogenetic stimulation. This implies that evoked gamma activity per se is not energy demanding. Optogenetic stimulation of PV interneurons during somatosensory stimulation reduced excitatory neuronal activity but did not potentiate O2 consumption as previously hypothesized. In conclusion, our data suggest that activity-driven CMRO2 responses depend on neuronal excitation rather than the cerebral rhythmic activity they induce. Excitation of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons requires energy, but inhibition of cortical excitatory neurons by interneurons does not potentiate activity-driven energy consumption.",

    "abstract": "Presentation rates - the tempo in which we encounter subsequent items - can alter both our behavioral and neural responses in cognitive domains such as learning, memory, decision-making, perception and language. However, it is still unclear to what extent presentation rates affect the momentary performance versus the underlying cognitive function or mental representation. Here we systemically tested the effect of presentation rate on performance versus competence in procedural learning - a fundamental cognitive function that underlies the acquisition of skills and habits. Procedural learning was assessed by a probabilistic sequence learning task, in which learning typically occurs implicitly. Stimulus presentation rates were systematically manipulated by the Response-to-Stimulus-Intervals (RSIs). Participants were assigned to a fast (120ms) RSI or a slow (850ms) RSI group during the Learning phase, and were tested with both RSIs 24 hours later (Testing phase). We also tested whether they gained explicit knowledge about the sequence or their knowledge remained implicit. We found that the slower RSI led to weaker performance in the Learning phase. Importantly, however, the results of the Testing phase showed that this effect was primarily due to the expression of the acquired knowledge and not the learning itself. Thus, the slower presentation rate affected performance rather than competence. The acquired knowledge remained implicit in both groups, regardless of the presentation rate during learning. These findings call for tasks that can dissociate competence from performance both in experimental and clinical settings. Additionally, our findings can help design more efficient training protocols in education and clinical rehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "How does the brain allow us to interact with others, and above all how does it handle situations when the goals of the interactors overlap (i.e. cooperation) or differ (i.e. competition)? Social neuroscience has already provided some answers to these questions but has tended to treat high-level, cognitive interpretations of social behavior separately from the sensorimotor mechanisms upon which they rely. The goal here is to identify the underlying neural processes and mechanisms linking sensorimotor coordination and intention attribution. We combine the Human Dynamic Clamp (HDC), a novel paradigm for studying realistic social behavior between self and other in well-controlled laboratory conditions, with high resolution electroencephalography (EEG). The collection of humanness and intention attribution reports, kinematics and neural data affords an opportunity to relate brain activity to the behavior of the HDC as well as to what the human is doing. Behavioral results demonstrate that sensorimotor coordination influences judgements of cooperativeness and humanness. Analysis of brain dynamics reveals two distinct networks related to integration of visuo-motor information from self and other. The two networks overlap over the right parietal region, an area known to be important for interpersonal motor interactions. Furthermore, connectivity analysis highlights how the judgement of humanness and cooperation of others modulate the connection between the right parietal hub and prefrontal cortex. These results reveal how distributed neural dynamics integrates information from  low-level sensorimotor mechanisms and  high-level social cognition to support the realistic social behaviors that play out in real time during interactive scenarios.\\n\\nSignificance StatementDaily social interactions require us to coordinate with others and to reflect on their potential motives. This study investigates the brain and behavioral dynamics of these two key aspects of social cognition. Combining high-density electroencephalography and the Human Dynamic Clamp (a Virtual Partner endowed with human-based coordination dynamics), we show first, that several features of sensorimotor coordination influence attribution of intention and judgement of humanness; second, that the right parietal lobe is a key integration hub between information related to self- and other-behavior; and third, that the posterior online social hub is functionally coupled to anterior offline brain structures to support mentalizing about others. Our results stress the complementary nature of low-level and high-level mechanisms that underlie social cognition.",
