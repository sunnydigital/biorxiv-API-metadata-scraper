    "abstract": "BackgroundIn light of the biodiversity crisis and our limited ability to explain variation in biodiversity, tools to quantify spatial and temporal variation in biodiversity and its underlying drivers are critically needed. Inspired by the recently published ecospace framework, we developed and tested a sampling design for environmental and biotic mapping. We selected 130 study sites (40 x 40 m) across Denmark using stratified random sampling along the major environmental gradients underlying biotic variation. Using standardized methods, we collected site species data on vascular plants, bryophytes, macrofungi, lichens, gastropods and arthropods. To evaluate sampling efficiency, we calculated regional coverage (relative to the known species number per taxonomic group), and site scale coverage (i.e., sample completeness per taxonomic group at each site). To extend taxonomic coverage to organisms that are difficult to sample by classical inventories (e.g., nematodes and non-fruiting fungi), we collected soil for metabarcoding. Finally, to assess site conditions, we mapped abiotic conditions, biotic resources and habitat continuity.\\n\\nResultsDespite the 130 study sites only covering a minute fraction (0.0005 %) of the total Danish terrestrial area, we found 1774 species of macrofungi (54 % of the Danish fungal species pool), 663 vascular plant species (42 %), 254 bryophyte species (41 %) and 200 lichen species (19 %). For arthropods, we observed 330 spider species (58 %), 123 carabid beetle species (37 %) and 99 hoverfly species (33 %). Correlations among species richness for taxonomic groups were predominantly positive. Overall, sample coverage was remarkably high across taxonomic groups and sufficient to capture substantial spatial variation in biodiversity across Denmark. This inventory is nationally unprecedented in detail and resulted in the discovery of 143 species with no previous record for Denmark. Comparison between plant OTUs detected in soil DNA and observed plant species confirmed the usefulness of carefully curated environmental DNA-data. Species richness did not correlate well among taxa suggesting differential and complex biotic responses to environmental variation.\\n\\nConclusionsWe successfully and adequately sampled a wide range of diverse taxa along key environmental gradients across Denmark using an approach that includes multi-taxon biodiversity assessment and ecospace mapping. Our approach is applicable to assessments of biodiversity in other regions and biomes where species are structured along environmental gradient.",

    "abstract": "The ectomycorrhizal symbiosis is a predominant tree-microbe interaction in forest ecosystems sustaining tree growth and health. Its establishment and functioning implies a long-term and intimate relationship between the soil-borne fungi and the roots of trees. Mycorrhiza-induced Small Secreted Proteins (MiSSPs) are hypothesized as keystone symbiotic proteins, required to set up the symbiosis by modifying the host metabolism and/or building the symbiotic interfaces.\\n\\nL. bicolor MiSSP8 is the third most highly induced MiSSPs in symbiotic tissues and it is also expressed in fruiting bodies. The MiSSP8-RNAi knockdown mutants are strongly impaired in their mycorrhization ability with Populus, with the lack of fungal mantle and Hartig net development due to a lack of hyphal aggregation. MiSSP8 C-terminus displays a repetitive motif containing a kexin cleavage site, recognized by KEX2 in vitro. This suggests MiSSP8 protein might be cleaved into small peptides. Moreover, the MiSSP8 repetitive motif is found in other proteins predicted secreted by both saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi. Thus, our data indicate that MiSSP8 is a small-secreted protein involved at early stages of ectomycorrhizal symbiosis, likely by regulating hyphal aggregation and pseudoparenchyma formation.",

    "abstract": "The global spread of antimicrobial resistance has been well documented in Gram-negative bacteria and healthcare-associated epidemic pathogens, often emerging from regions with heavy antimicrobial use. However, the degree to which similar processes occur with Gram-positive bacteria in the community setting is less well understood. Here we demonstrate the recent origin and global spread from the Indian subcontinent of a multidrug resistant Staphylococcus aureus lineage, sequence type 772 (Bengal Bay clone). Short-term outbreaks occurred following intercontinental transmission, typically associated with travel and family contacts, but ongoing endemic transmission was uncommon. Instrumental in the emergence of a single dominant clade in the early 1990s was the acquisition of a multidrug resistance integrated plasmid that did not appear to incur a significant fitness cost. The Bengal Bay clone therefore combines the multidrug resistance of traditional healthcare-associated clones with the epidemiological and virulence potential of community-associated clones.",

Different patterns of MAPK activity dynamics could be identified by clustering cells based on their CDK activity, denoting the tight relationship between these two cellular signals.

    "abstract": "The coordinated execution of innate, stereotyped sexual behaviours, such as courtship and mating, requires sexually dimorphic sensory-motor circuits that are genetically specified during development (reviewed in [1-3]). Studies in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, in which the development and function of neural circuits can be interrogated with single cell resolution, have revealed two general developmental mechanisms underlying sexual dimorphism in the nervous system. The first involves the acquisition of sexually dimorphic features in sex-shared neurons during sexual maturation, which include changes in terminal gene expression, such as odorant receptors, neurotransmitters and synaptic regulators [4-10]. The second mechanism involves the generation of sex-specific neurons [11-13]. This requires sex-specific cell death [14]or neurogenesis events resulting from extensive sex differences in the cell division patterns and neurodevelopmental programmes of post-embryonic cell lineages (reviewed in [3]). Here we identify a third, novel way to generate sexual dimorphism in the nervous system. We find that during sexual maturation (L4 stage), a class of sex-shared glial cells acquires sexually dimorphic function by undergoing a direct glia-to-neuron transdifferentiation that results in the production of male-specific neurons. This plasticity is regulated cell-intrinsically by the sex-determination pathway. These previously unnoticed neurons, which we term PHDs, are putative proprioceptors that regulate male locomotion during specific steps of mating. One of these steps is a novel readjustment movement performed when intromission becomes difficult to achieve. Our results reveal sex-specific direct transdifferentiation as a novel mechanism for generating sex-specific neurons and also show the importance of proprioceptive feedback during the complex steps of mating for successful reproduction.",

    "abstract": "The \"neural correlates of consciousness\" (NCC) is a familiar topic in neuroscience, overlapping with research on the brains \"default mode network\". Task-based studies of NCC by their nature recruit one part of the cortical network to study another, and are therefore both limited and compromised in what they can reveal about consciousness itself. The form of consciousness explored in such research, we term the human default consciousness (DCs), our everyday waking consciousness. In contrast, studies of anaesthesia, coma, deep sleep, or some extreme pathological states such as epilepsy, reveal very different cortical activity; all of which states are essentially involuntary, and generally regarded as \"unconscious\". An exception to involuntary disruption of consciousness is Buddhist jh[a]na meditation, whose implicit aim is to intentionally withdraw from the default consciousness, to an inward-directed state of stillness referred to as jh[a]na consciousness, as a basis to develop insight. The default consciousness is sensorily-based, where information about, and our experience of, the outer world is evaluated against personal and organic needs and forms the basis of our ongoing self-experience. This view conforms both to Buddhist models, and to the emerging work on active inference and minimisation of free energy in determining the network balance of the human default consciousness.\n\nThis paper is a preliminary report on the first detailed EEG study of jh[a]na meditation, with findings radically different to studies of more familiar, less focused forms of meditation. While remaining highly alert and \"present\" in their subjective experience, a high proportion of subjects display \"spindle\" activity in their EEG, superficially similar to sleep spindles of stage 2 nREM sleep, while more-experienced subjects display high voltage slow-waves reminiscent, but significantly different, to the slow waves of deeper stage 4 nREM sleep, or even high-voltage delta coma. Some others show brief posterior spike-wave bursts, again similar, but with significant differences, to absence epilepsy. Some subjects also develop the ability to consciously evoke clonic seizure-like activity at will, under full control. We suggest that the remarkable nature of these observations reflects a profound disruption of the human DCs when the personal element is progressively withdrawn.",

    "abstract": "Pairs of nucleotides within biologically functional nucleic acid secondary structures often exhibit evidence of coevolution that is consistent with the maintenance of canonical base-pairing. MESSI is a sequence evolution model that infers substitution rates associated with base-paired sites in alignments of DNA or RNA sequences. MESSI can estimate these whilst simultaneously accounting for the uncertainty associated with an unknown RNA or DNA secondary structure shared across an alignment of sequences. Moreover, the unknown structure can be predicted, or a base-pairing probability matrix calculated. MESSI optionally leverages CUDA GPU parallelism to accelerate inference. MESSI was used to infer coevolution rates associated with GC, AU (AT in DNA), GU (GT in DNA) pairs in non-coding RNA alignments, and single-stranded RNA and DNA virus alignments. Inferred rates of GU pair coevolution were found to be higher at base-paired sites in single-stranded RNA viruses and non-coding RNAs than those of GT pairs in single-stranded DNA viruses, suggesting that GT pairs do not stabilise DNA secondary structures to the same extent as GU pairs in RNA. The relative coevolution rates associated with GC, AU, and GU pairs were largely consistent with their relative chemical base-pairing stabilities (GC base-pairs being more stable than AU base-pairs, and AU base-pairs being more stable than GU base-pairs). Additionally, MESSI estimates the degrees of coevolution at individual base-paired sites in an alignment. These estimates were computed for a SHAPE-MaP-determined HIV-1 NL4-3 RNA secondary structure and two corresponding alignments. MESSIs estimates of coevolution were significantly more strongly correlated with experimentally-determined SHAPE-MaP pairing scores as compared to three non-evolutionary measures of base-pairing covariation. Finally, to assist researchers in prioritising substructures with potential biological functionality, MESSI automatically identifies substructures and ranks them by degrees of coevolution at base-paired sites within them. Such a ranking was created for an HIV-1 subtype B alignment, revealing an excess of top-ranking substructures that have been previously identified in the literature as having structure-related functional importance, and a number of top-ranking structures that have not yet been characterised.",

    "abstract": "The epithelial lining of the small intestine consists of multiple cell types, including Paneth cells and goblet cells, that work in cohort to maintain gut health. 3D in vitro cultures of human primary epithelial cells, called organoids, have become a key model to study the functions of Paneth cells and goblet cells in normal and diseased conditions. Advances in these models include the ability to skew differentiation to particular lineages, providing a useful tool to study cell type specific function/dysfunction in the context of the epithelium. Here, we use comprehensive profiling of mRNA, microRNA and long non-coding RNA expression to confirm that Paneth cell and goblet cell enrichment of murine small intestinal organoids (enteroids) establishes a physiologically accurate model. We employ network analysis to infer the regulatory landscape altered by skewing differentiation, and using knowledge of cell type specific markers, we predict key regulators of cell type specific functions: Cebpa, Jun, Nr1d1 and Rxra specific to Paneth cells, Gfi1b and Myc specific for goblet cells and Ets1, Nr3c1 and Vdr shared between them. Links identified between these regulators and cellular phenotypes of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) suggest that global regulatory rewiring during or after differentiation of Paneth cells and goblet cells could contribute to IBD aetiology. Future application of cell type enriched enteroids combined with the presented computational workflow can be used to disentangle multifactorial mechanisms of these cell types and propose regulators whose pharmacological targeting could be advantageous in treating IBD patients with Crohns disease or ulcerative colitis.\\n\\nTable of contentsWe demonstrate the application of network biology techniques to increase understanding of intestinal dysbiosis through studying transcriptomics data from Paneth and goblet cell enriched enteroids.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=100 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/575845v4_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (25K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16637e5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dfaa77org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1307c00org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d16e0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation treatment that is FDA-approved for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Recent methodological advancements suggest iTBS could be improved through 1) treating with multiple sessions per day at optimally-spaced intervals, 2) applying a higher overall pulse-dose of stimulation and 3) precision targeting of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) to subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) circuit. We examined the feasibility, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of an accelerated, high-dose, resting-state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI)-guided iTBS protocol for TRD termed  Stanford Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy (SAINT).\n\nMethodsTwenty-one participants with TRD received open-label SAINT. FcMRI was used to individually target the region of L-DLPFC most anticorrelated with sgACC. Fifty iTBS sessions (1800 pulses per session, 50-minute inter-session interval) were delivered as 10 daily sessions over 5 consecutive days at 90% resting motor threshold (adjusted for cortical depth). Neuropsychological testing was conducted before and after SAINT.\n\nResultsNineteen of 21 participants (90.48%) met criteria for remission ([&le;]10 on the Montgomery-[A]sberg Depression Rating Scale) immediately after SAINT. Neuropsychological testing demonstrated no negative cognitive side-effects. There were no seizures or other severe adverse events.\n\nDiscussionOur accelerated, high-dose, iTBS protocol with fcMRI-guided targeting (SAINT) was well tolerated and safe. Efficacy was strikingly high, especially for this treatment-resistant population. Double-blinded sham-controlled trials are required to confirm the high remission rate found in this initial study.\n\nTrial registrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT03240692",

    "abstract": "Witness trees from GLO surveys covering 6,300 square miles around Puget Sound (western Washington State) reveal, for the first time, the character and local diversity in the regions mid-19th-century forest cover, before it was severely logged during the settlement period. Although only a few coniferous and hardwood species occurred overall, discrete geographical areas supported distinctive species compositions. Geo-climatic and developmental factors are explored to explain these local differences. Profiles of tree diameters reveal that most trees were small to medium in size, even though most areas also exhibited a minority of larger legacy trees. Approximate stand ages and stages of ecological succession are inferred from local tree sizes and site qualities. Despite current inclusion within the Western Hemlock Zone, major portions of the Puget lowlands (below 1000 feet) displayed extremely few western hemlock, the putative climax species, even stands of decidedly advanced age; in extreme cases \\\"pioneer old growth\\\" prevailed. Conversely, hemlock was strongly predominant in the regions framing foothills (above 1000 feet), even when stand age there was relatively low. These problematic successional conditions question whether many early forests around Puget Sound deserve a categorical recognition separate from the Western Hemlock Zone.",

    "abstract": "The wealth of information deliverable from transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) is significant, however current applications for variant detection still remain a challenge due to the complexity of the transcriptome. Given the ability of RNA-seq to reveal active regions of the genome, detection of RNA-seq SNPs can prove valuable in understanding the phenotypic diversity between populations. Thus, we present a novel computational workflow named VAP (Variant Analysis Pipeline) that takes advantage of multiple RNA-seq splice aware aligners to call SNPs in non-human models using RNA-seq data only. We applied VAP to RNA-seq from a highly inbred chicken line and achieved >97% precision and >99% sensitivity when compared with the matching whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. Over 65% of WGS coding variants were identified from RNA-seq. Further, our results discovered SNPs resulting from post translational modifications, such as RNA editing, which may reveal potentially functional variation that would have otherwise been missed in genomic data. Even with the limitation in detecting variants in expressed regions only, our method proves to be a reliable alternative for SNP identification using RNA-seq data.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInfected diabetic foot ulcer (IDFU) is a public health issue and a leading cause of non-traumatic limb amputation. Very few published data on IDFU is available in most West African countries. The objective of this study was to investigate the etiological agents of IDFU and the challenge of antibacterial drug resistance in the management of infections.\\n\\nMethodsThis was a prospective cross-sectional hospital-based study involving three tertiary healthcare facilities. Consecutive eligible patients presenting in the facilities were recruited. Tissue biopsies and/or aspirates were collected and cultured on a set of selective and non-selective media and incubated in appropriate atmospheric conditions for 24 to 72 hours. Isolates were identified by established standard methods. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using modified Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Specific resistance determinants were investigated by polymerase chain reaction-based protocols. Data analysis was done with SPSS version 20.\\n\\nResultsNinety patients with clinical diagnosis of DFI were studied between July 2016 and April 2017. A total of 218 microorganisms were isolated, comprising 129 (59.2%) Gram-negative bacilli (GNB), 59 (27.1%) Gram-positive cocci (GPC) and 29 (13.2%) anaerobic bacteria. The top five facultative/aerobic bacteria encountered were: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Citrobacter spp. representing 41 (18.8%), 23 (10.5%), 20 (9.2%), 19 (8.7%) and 19 (8.7%) isolates, in that order, respectively. The commonest anaerobes were Bacteroides spp., and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius which accounted for 7 (24.1%) and 6 (20.7%), respectively. Of the 93 IDFU cases, 74 (80%) were infected by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria predominantly methicillin-resistant S. aureus, extended-spectrum {beta}-lactamase-producing GNB, mainly of the CTX-M variety. Only 4 (3.1%) GNB were carbapenemase-producers encoded by blaVIM. Factors associated with presence of MDR bacteria were peripheral neuropathy (r= 4.05, P= 0.042) and duration of foot infection >1 month(r= 7.63, P= 0.015).\\n\\nConclusionsMDR facultative/aerobic bacteria are overrepresented amongst agents causing IDFU. A relatively low proportion of the etiological agents were anaerobic bacteria. This finding should help formulate empirical therapeutic options for managing IDFU. Furthermore, drastic reduction in inappropriate use of cocktail of antibiotics for IDFUs is advocated to combat infection by MDR bacteria in these patients.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHypertension is a common public health problem worldwide and is a well-known risk factor for increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, contributing to high morbidity and mortality. However, there is no systematic review and meta-analysis that has been done in a multi-ethnic population like Malaysia. This systematic review aims to determine the trend in prevalence, awareness and control of hypertension in Malaysia.\\n\\nMethodsSystematic searches were conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Ovid, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Malaysian Medical Repository and Malaysia Citation Index published between 1980 and 2017. All original articles in English were included. Studies included were those on adults aged 18 years and above. Studies of prevalence in children and adolescents and pregnancy related hypertension were excluded. Two authors independently reviewed the studies, carried out data extraction and performed quality assessment. Heterogeneity between studies and publication bias was assessed and effect size was pooled by the random effect model.\\n\\nResultsFifty-six studies with a total of 241,796 subjects were included. The prevalence of hypertension throughout Malaysia varied (I2 = 99.3%). The overall pooled prevalence of hypertension over the past 4 decades was 28.2% in adults aged 18 years and older (95% CI: 26.1 - 33.3) and the prevalence in those 30 years and older was 40.0% (95% CI: 35.3-44.8).\\n\\nFor subgroup analysis, the prevalence of hypertension in male aged 18 and above was 31.4% (95% CI: 26.5 - 36.2) and 27.8% in female (95% CI: 20.7 - 34.9). The prevalence of hypertension among the ethnic groups aged 18 years and above were 37.3% in Malays (95% CI: 32.9 - 41.7); 36.4% in Chinese (95% CI 31.6 - 41.2) and 34.8% in Indians (95% CI: 31.2-38.4). The prevalence of hypertension was the lowest in the 1980s (16.2%, 95% CI: 13.4-19.0%), increases up to 36.8% in the 1990s (95% CI: 6.1-67.5), then came down to 28.7% (95% CI: 21.7-35.8) in the 2000s and 29.2% (95% CI: 24.0-34.4) in the 2010s. The prevalence of awareness was 38.7% (95% CI: 31.7 - 45.8) whereas the control of hypertension of those on treatment was 33.3% (95% CI: 28.4 - 38.2).\\n\\nConclusionThree in 10 adults aged 18 years old and above have hypertension, whereas four in 10 adults aged 30 years old and above have hypertension. Four out of 10 are aware of their hypertension status and only one-third of them who were under treatment achieved control of their hypertension. Concerted efforts by policymakers and healthcare professionals to improve the awareness and control of hypertension should be of high priority.",

Analysis of our in vivo recordings and simulations of our model of the olfactory network suggests that GGN extends the dynamic range of KCs, and leads us to predict the existence of a yet undiscovered olfactory pathway.

    "abstract": "Efforts to protect and restore tropical wetlands impacted by feral pigs (Sus scrofa) in northern Australia have more recently included exclusion fences, an abatement response proposing fences improve wetland condition by protecting habitat for fish production and water quality. Here we tested: 1) whether the fish assemblage are similar in wetlands with and without fences; and 2) whether specific environmental processes influence fish composition differently between fenced and unfenced wetlands. Twenty-one floodplain and riverine wetlands in the Archer River catchment (Queensland) were surveyed during post-wet (June-August) and late-dry season (November-December) in 2016, 2017 and 2018, using a fyke soaked overnight (~14-15hrs). A total of 6,353 fish representing twenty-six species from 15 families were captured. There were no multivariate differences in fish assemblages between seasons, years and for fenced and unfenced wetlands (PERMANOVA, Pseduo-F <0.58, P<0.68). Late-dry season fish were considerably smaller compared to post-wet season: a strategy presumably to maximise rapid disposal following rain. At each wetland a calibrated Hydrolab was deployed (between 2-4 days, with 20min logging) in the epilimnion (0.2m), and revealed distinct diel water quality cycling of temperature, dissolved oxygen and pH (conductivity represented freshwater wetlands) which was more obvious in the late-dry season survey, because of extreme summer conditions. Water quality varied among wetlands, in terms of the daily amplitude, and extent of daily photosynthesis recovery, which highlights the need to consider local site conditions rather than applying general assumptions around water quality conditions for these types of wetlands examined here. Though many fish access (fenced and unfenced) wetlands during wet season connection, the seasonal effect of reduced water level conditions seems to be more over-improvised compared to whether fences are installed or not, as all wetlands supported few, juvenile, or no fish species because they had dried completed regardless of whether fences were present or not.",

    "abstract": "Multiple cross-sectional studies have shown that regular complex exercises, which require cognitive demands (e.g., decision making) and various motions, are associated with greater positive effects on executive functions compared to simple exercises. However, the evidence of a single bout of complex exercises is mixed, and investigations on the acute effect of complex exercise using a well-controlled within-subjects research design are few. Therefore, we compared the acute effects of complex exercise on inhibitory functions with those of simple running. Twenty young adults performed three interventions, which were running, badminton, and seated rest as a control condition for 10 min each. During each intervention, oxygen consumption and heart rate were monitored. A Stroop test and a reverse-Stroop test were completed before and after each intervention. The intensities of the badminton and running were equivalent. Badminton significantly improved performance on the Stroop task compared to seated rest; however, running did not enhance performance on the Stroop task relative to seated rest. A single bout of complex exercise elicits a larger benefit to inhibitory function than a single bout of simple exercise. However, the benefit of complex exercise may vary depending on the type of cognitive control.",

    "abstract": "Lipid mobilization and transport in insects is under investigation, especially lipases and lipophorin because of their roles in energy production and transport of lipids at flying activity. The present study has been conducted to purify intracellular fat body lipase for the first time, from last larval instar of Galleria mellonella. Purification methods by combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel filtration using Sephadex G-100 demonstrated that the amount of protein and the specific activity of fat body lipase were 0.008633{+/-}0.000551 mg/ml and 1.5754{+/-}0.1042 mol/min/mg protein, respectively, with a 98.9 fold purity and recovery of 50.81%. Hence, the sephadex G-100 step was more effective in purification process. SDS-PAGE and zymogram revealed that fat body lipase showed two monomers with molecular weights of 178.8 and 62.6 kDa. Furthermore biochemical characterization of fat body lipase was carried out through testing its activities against several factors such as; different temperatures, pH ranges, metal ions and inhibitors ending by determination of their kinetic parameters with the use of p-Nitrophenyl butyrate (PNPB) as a substrate. The highest activities of enzyme were determined at the temperature ranges of 35-37{degrees}C and 37-40{degrees}C and pH ranges of 7-9 and 7-10. The partially purified enzyme showed significant stimulation by Ca2+, K+ and Na+ metal ions indicating that fat body lipase is metalloproteinase. Additionally, lipase activity was strongly inhibited by some inhibitors; phenylmethylsulfony fluoride (PMSF), ethylene-diaminetetractic acid (EDTA) and ethylene glycoltetraacetic acid (EGTA) providing an evidence of presence of serine residue and activation of enzymes by metal ions. Kinetic parameters were 301.95mM Km and 0.316 Umg-1 Vmax. By considering the purification of fat body lipase from larvae and using some inhibitors especially ion chelating agents, it is suggested to develop this study by using lipase inhibitors to reach a successful control of Galleria mellonella in the near future.",

    "abstract": "Despite the advent of new techniques for genetic engineering of bacteria, allelic exchange through homologous recombination remains an important tool for genetic analysis. Currently, sacB-based vector systems are often used for allelic exchange, but counter-selection escape, which prevents isolation of cells with the desired mutation, limits its utility. To circumvent this limitation, we engineered a series of \\\"pTOX\\\" allelic exchange vectors. Each plasmid encodes one of a set of inducible toxins, chosen for their potential utility in a wide range of medically important Proteobacteria. A codon-optimized rhaS transcriptional activator with a strong synthetic ribosome binding site enables tight toxin induction even in organisms lacking an endogenous rhamnose regulon. Expression of the blue amilCP or magenta tsPurple non-fluorescent chromoproteins facilitates monitoring of successful single- and double-crossover events using these vectors. The versatility of these vectors was demonstrated by deleting genes in Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Enterobacter cloacae, and Shigella flexneri. Finally, pTOX was used to characterize the impact of disruption of all combinations of the 3 orthologous S. marcescens peptidoglycan amidohydrolases on chromosomal ampC beta-lactamase activity and corresponding beta-lactam antibiotic resistance. Mutation of multiple amidohydrolases was necessary for high level ampC derepression and beta-lactam resistance. These data suggest why beta-lactam resistance may emerge during treatment less frequently in S. marcescens than in other AmpC-producing pathogens like E. cloacae. Collectively, our findings suggest that the pTOX vectors should be broadly useful for genetic engineering of Gram-negative bacteria.\\n\\nImportanceTargeted modification of bacterial genomes is critical for genetic analyses of microorganisms. Allelic exchange is a technique that relies on homologous recombination to substitute native loci for engineered sequences. However, current allelic exchange vectors often enable only weak selection for successful homologous recombination. We developed a suite of new allelic exchange vectors, pTOX, which were validated in several medically important Proteobacteria. They encode visible non-fluorescent chromoproteins that enable easy identification of colonies bearing integrated vector, and permit stringent selection for the second step of homologous recombination, yielding modified loci. We demonstrate the utility of these vectors by using them to investigate the effect of inactivation of Serratia marcescens peptidoglycan amidohydrolases on beta-lactam antibiotic resistance.",

    "abstract": "AbstrsctClerodendrum trichotomum, an important medicinal plant, has excellent salt tolerance and beautiful ornamental character. However, reliable reference genes for quantitative real-time PCR data (qRT-PCR) in C. trichotomum have not been investigated. Using our previous transcriptome data, 17 reference genes were selected in different tissues (leaves, flowers, fruits, stems, and roots) and under various abiotic stresses (salt, drought, flood, and heat) for C. trichotomum, using four different reference gene analysis software types: GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and ReFinder. The results identified RPL, ACT and HSP70 as the three most suitable reference genes for tissues. Genes ACT and AP-2 were most stably expressed under drought stress; MDH and UBCE2 were stable under flooding stress; RPL and UBCE2 were most stable under salt stress; and MDH and EF-1A were most appropriate under heat stress. For abiotic treatments, RPL, MDH and AP-2 were the most stable reference genes; and AP-2, RPL and ACT were stably expressed in all examined samples. The expression profile of the genes for Na+/H+ Exchanger1 (ClNHX1) and laccase (ClLAC) were selected to validate the stability of the determined reference genes. Our study provided reliable normalization for gene expression analysis and ensured more accurate data for further molecular mechanism research in C. trichotomum.",

    "abstract": "We exploited genetic information to assess the role of non-genetic factors in multifactorial diseases. To this aim we isolated candidate \\\"interactomes\\\" (i.e. groups of genes whose products are known to physically interact with environmental exposures and biological processes, plausibly relevant for disease pathogenesis) and analyzed nominal statistical evidence of association with genetic predisposition to multiple sclerosis (MS) and other inflammatory and non-inflammatory complex disorders. The interaction between genotype and Herpesviruses emerged as specific for MS, with Epstein Barr virus (EBV) showing higher levels of significance compared to Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) and, more evidently, to cytomegalovirus (CMV). In accord with this result, when we classified the MS-associated genes contained in the interactomes into canonical pathways, the analysis converged towards biological functions of B cells, in particular the CD40 pathway. When we analyzed peripheral blood transcriptomes in persons with MS, we found a significant dysregulation of MS-associated genes belonging to the EBV interactome in primary progressive MS. This study indicates that the interaction between herpesviruses and predisposing genetic background is of causal significance in MS, and provides a mechanistic explanation for the long-recognized association between EBV and this condition.",

    "abstract": "The Arabidopsis DEMETER (DME) DNA glycosylase demethylates the maternal genome in the central cell prior to fertilization, and is essential for seed viability. DME preferentially targets small transposons that flank coding genes, influencing their expression and initiating plant gene imprinting. DME also targets intergenic and heterochromatic regions, and how it is recruited to these differing chromatin landscapes is unknown. The C-terminal DME catalytic core consists of three conserved regions required for catalysis in vitro. We show that the catalytic core of DME guides active demethylation at endogenous targets, rescuing the developmental and genomic hypermethylation phenotypes of DME mutants. However, without the N-terminus, heterochromatin demethylation is significantly impeded, and abundant CG-methylated genic sequences are ectopically demethylated. We used comparative analysis to reveal that the conserved DME N-terminal domains are only present in the flowering plants, whereas the domain architecture of DME-like proteins in non-vascular plants mainly resembles the catalytic core, suggesting that it might represent the ancestral form of the 5mC DNA glycosylase found in all plant lineages. We propose a bipartite model for DME protein action and suggest that the DME N-terminus was acquired late during land plant evolution to improve specificity and facilitate demethylation at heterochromatin targets.",

    "abstract": "The two main collagen receptors on platelets, GPVI and integrin 2{beta}1, play an important role for the recognition of exposed collagen at sites of vessel injury, which leads to platelet activation and subsequently stable thrombus formation. Both receptors are already expressed on megakaryocytes, the platelet forming cells within the bone marrow. Megakaryocytes are in permanent contact with collagen filaments in the marrow cavity and at the basal lamina of sinusoids without obvious preactivation. The role of both collagen receptors for megakaryocyte maturation and thrombopoiesis is still poorly understood. To investigate the function of both collagen receptors, we generated mice that are double deficient for Gp6 and Itga2. Flow cytometric analyses revealed that the deficiency of both receptors had no impact on platelet number and the expected lack in GPVI responsiveness. Integrin activation and degranulation ability was comparable to wildtype mice. By immunofluorescence microscopy, we could demonstrate that double-deficient megakaryocytes were overall normally distributed within the bone marrow. We found megakaryocyte count and size to be normal, the localization within the bone marrow, the degree of maturation, as well as their association to sinusoids were also unaltered. However, the contact of megakaryocytes to collagen type I filaments was decreased at sinusoids compared to wildtype mice, while the interaction to type IV collagen was unaffected. Our results imply that GPVI and 2{beta}1 have no influence on the localization of megakaryocytes within the bone marrow, their association to the sinusoids or their maturation. The decreased contact of megakaryocytes to collagen type I might at least partially explain the unaltered platelet phenotype in these mice, since proplatelet formation is mediated by these receptors and their interaction to collagen. It is rather likely that other compensatory signaling pathways and receptors play a role that needs to be elucidated.",

    "abstract": "1.Introgression of alleles from wild relatives has often been adaptive, usually for disease resistance, in plant breeding. However, the significance of historical hybridization events in modern breeding is often not clear. Cassava (Manihot esculenta) is among the most important staple foods in the world, sustaining hundreds of millions of people in the tropics, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Widespread genotyping makes cassava a model for clonally-propagated root and tuber crops in the developing world and provides an opportunity to study the modern benefits and consequences of historical introgression. We detected large introgressed M. glaziovii genome-segments in a collection of 2742 modern cassava landraces and elite germplasm, the legacy of 1930s era breeding to combat epidemics disease. African landraces and improved varieties were on average 3.8% (max 13.6%) introgressed. Introgressions accounted for significant (mean 20%, max 56%) portion of the heritability of tested traits M. glaziovii alleles on the distal 10Mb of chr. 1 increased dry matter and root number. On chr. 4, introgressed alleles in a 20Mb region improved harvest index and brown streak disease tolerance. Three cycles of selection initially doubled the introgression frequency on chr. 1. Later stage variety trials selectively excluded homozygotes which indicates a heterozygous advantage. We show that maintaining large recombination-suppressed introgressions in the heterozygous state allows the accumulation of deleterious mutations. We conclude that targeted recombination of introgression segments would therefore increase the efficiency of cassava breeding by allowing simultaneous fixation of beneficial alleles and purging of genetic load.\\n\\nSignificance StatementCrosses to wild relatives have often been adaptive for crop breeding, but their modern importance is usually poorly understood. Cassava (Manihot esculenta) is an important staple crop, feeding hundreds of millions in the developing world, and is a model for vegetatively-propagated non-inbred crops. In the 1930s, crossing to M. glaziovii averted mosaic disease epidemic in Africa. We reveal that large genome segments, the legacy of those crosses, benefit a number of traits including yield in modern cassava and are consistently favored during selection. Elite cultivars are almost exclusively heterozygous for wild alleles; homozygotes are rejected during early stage trials, suggesting inbreeding depression. More recombination around beneficial wild alleles will allow purging of genetic load and increase genetic gain in cassava.",

The role of the host response in these phenotypic differences is not known and to address this we performed a transcriptomic analysis of a monocyte cell line (THP-1) infected with these two parasite species. The pathways altered by infection were shared between species ~95% the time, but the magnitude of the host response to H. hammondi was significantly higher compared to T. gondii. Accompanying this divergent host response was an equally divergent impact on the cell cycle of the host cell. In contrast to T. gondii, H. hammondi infection induces cell cycle arrest via pathways linked to DNA-damage responses and cellular senescence and robust secretion of multiple chemokines that are known to be a part of the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Remarkably T. gondii-conditioned media can suppress the SASP response during H. hammondi infection, and this suppression is accompanied by a corresponding increase in the replication rate of H. hammondi in recipient cells. Taken together our data suggest that T. gondii manipulation of the host cell cycle provides a novel mechanism to avoid stress and/or DNA-damage induced responses by the host cell, and that this ability has a direct impact on parasite replication rate both within the host cell as well as in bystander cells.",

Non-familial cases of retinoblastoma (Rb) presenting between January 2006 and December 2011 were included. Data collected included: age at diagnosis, gender, childs ethnicity, International Intraocular Retinoblastoma Classification (IIRC) stage with Groups D and E being considered advanced, laterality, treatment, and postcodes. Individual postcode (ZIP code) data was used to obtain the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) score. A postal questionnaire was sent to participants parents to collect further, person-level, information on languages spoken and household socioeconomic position. Measures of severity of retinoblastoma also included: requirement for primary enucleation; the use of adjuvant chemotherapy; and mortality.\\n\\nResults189 cases were analyzed. 98 (52%) male and 91 (48%) female. Median age at diagnosis was 16 months [IQR 8 - 34 months]. 153/189 (81%) of cases presented with advanced retinoblastoma; 75 (40%) group E, 78 (41%) group D. 134 (72%) of cases were treated with enucleation.\\n\\nMultivariable analysis showed that older age at presentation was associated with enucleation and bilateral disease was associated with adjuvant chemotherapy. There was some indication that South Asian ethnicity and being in the most deprived IMD quintile were associated with a higher likelihood of presentation with advanced disease, but these estimates did not reach statistical significance.\\n\\nConclusionsIn this first national UK study of patients with non-familial retinoblastoma, there was no evidence of an association of ethnicity or socio-economic status and the risk of presenting with advanced disease.

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen and has to cope with reactive oxygen and chlorine species (ROS, RCS) during infections. The low molecular weight thiol bacillithiol (BSH) is an important defense mechanism of S. aureus for detoxification of ROS and HOCl stress to maintain the reduced state of the cytoplasm. Under HOCl stress, BSH forms mixed disulfides with proteins, termed as S-bacillithiolations, which are reduced by bacilliredoxins (BrxA and BrxB). The NADPH-dependent flavin disulfide reductase YpdA is phylogenetically associated with the BSH synthesis and BrxA/B enzymes and was proposed to function as BSSB reductase. Here, we investigated the role of the bacilliredoxin BrxAB/BSH/YpdA pathway in S. aureus COL under oxidative stress and macrophage infection conditions in vivo and in biochemical assays in vitro. Using HPLC thiol metabolomics, a strongly enhanced BSSB level and a decreased BSH/BSSB ratio were measured in the S. aureus COL ypdA deletion mutant under control and NaOCl stress. Monitoring the BSH redox potential (EBSH) using the Brx-roGFP2 biosensor revealed that YpdA is required for regeneration of the reduced EBSH upon recovery from oxidative stress. In addition, the ypdA mutant was impaired in H2O2 detoxification as measured with the novel H2O2-specific Tpx-roGFP2 biosensor. Phenotype analyses further showed that BrxA and YpdA are required for survival under NaOCl and H2O2 stress in vitro and inside murine J-774A.1 macrophages in infection assays in vivo. Finally, NADPH-coupled electron transfer assays provide evidence for the function of YpdA in BSSB reduction, which depends on the conserved Cys14 residue. YpdA acts together with BrxA and BSH in de-bacillithiolation of S-bacilithiolated GapDH. In conclusion, our results point to a major role of the BrxA/BSH/YpdA pathway in BSH redox homeostasis in S. aureus during recovery from oxidative stress and under infections.",

Child  s ch.pc1.D{uparrow}R{uparrow}C{uparrow} was associated with decreased birth weight (p=0.036), and increased childs BMIZ (p=0.002); and ch.pc2.D{downarrow}A{uparrow}L{uparrow} was associated with increased childs BMIZ (p=0.005), decreased maternal height (p=0.030) and girls (p=0.002). Elevated adiponectin and leptin pattern in pregnancy was associated with increased C-reactive protein and vitamin A and D binding proteins pattern in children, suggesting biomarkers acting in concert may be more important than single biomarker effects. Patterns in pregnancy proximal to birth were more associated with child status, and child patterns were most frequently associated with child status, particularly child BMI. Although MMN supplementation and certain maternal biomarker patterns have effects on metabolism and inflammation in pregnancy and in the child, nevertheless, nutrition conditions after birth may have a greater impact.",

    "abstract": "Declining ejaculate performance with male age is taxonomically widespread and has broad ramifications for fertility and fitness. However, we have a poor understanding of age-related changes to specific ejaculate components, how they cause reduced performance, and whether the decline is ameliorable. Here, we show that, in Drosophila, sperm production chronologically declines with age, invariant to mating activity, while repeated mating causes infertility via reduced sperm stores and viability. However, changes to sperm do not fully explain ejaculate deterioration: impacts on seminal fluid contribute to aspects of reduced ejaculate performance, associated with shifts in proteome abundance and quality. We show that ablation of insulin-like peptide-producing cells in males ameliorates aspects of ejaculate performance loss, suggesting that anti-ageing interventions can be coopted to benefit male reproductive health.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryEjaculate performance declines with male age via mating-dependent sperm and seminal protein deterioration, but it can be ameliorated.",

    "abstract": "Myxomatosis is a lethal disease of wild European and domestic rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) caused by a Myxoma virus (MYXV) infection, a leporipoxvirus that is found naturally in some Sylvilagus rabbit species in South America and California. The introduction of MYXV in the early 1950s into feral European rabbit populations in Australia and Europe demonstrate the best documented field example of host-virus coevolution following a cross-species transmission. Recently, a new cross-species jump of MYXV has been suggested in both Great Britain and Spain, where European brown hares (Lepus europaeus) and Iberian hares (Lepus granatensis) were found dead with lesions consistent with those observed in myxomatosis. To investigate the possibility of a new cross-species transmission event by MYXV, tissue samples collected from a wild Iberian hare found dead in Spain (Toledo region) were analyzed and deep sequenced. Our results report a new MYXV strain (MYXV Toledo) in the tissues of this species. The genome of this new strain encodes three disrupted genes (M009L, M036L and M152R) and a novel 2.8 KB recombinant region that resulted from an insertion of four novel poxviral genes towards the 5 end of its genome. From the open reading frames inserted into the MYXV Toledo strain, a new orthologue of a poxvirus host range gene family member was identified which is related to the MYXV gene M064R. Overall, we confirmed the identity of a new MYXV strain in Iberian hares that we hypothesize was able to more effectively counteract the host defenses in hares and start an infectious process in this new host.",

    "abstract": "Anal sacs are an important odor producing organ found across the mammalian Order Carnivora. Secretions from the anal sac may be used as chemical signals by animals for behaviors ranging from defense to species recognition to signaling reproductive status. In addition, a recent study suggests that domestic cats utilize short-chain free fatty acids in anal sac secretions for individual recognition. The fermentation hypothesis is the idea that symbiotic microorganisms living in association with animals contribute to odor profiles used in chemical communication and that variation in these chemical signals reflects variation in the microbial community. Here we examine the fermentation hypothesis by characterizing volatile organic compounds (VOC) and bacteria isolated from anal sac secretions collected from a male bengal cat, a cross between a domestic cat and wild leopard cat (Felis catus x Prionailurus bengalensis).\\n\\nBoth left and right anal sacs of a male bengal cat were manually expressed (emptied) and collected. Half of the material was used to culture bacteria or to extract bacterial DNA and other half was used for VOC analysis. DNA was extracted from the anal sac secretions and used for a 16S rRNA gene sequence based characterization of the microbial community. Additionally, some of the material was plated out in order to isolate bacterial colonies. The same three taxa, Bacteroides fragilis, Tessaracoccus, and Finegoldia magna were abundant in the 16S rRNA gene sequence data and also isolated by culturing. Using Solid Phase Microextraction (SPME) gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), we tentatively identified 52 compounds from bengal cat anal sac secretions and 67 compounds from cultures of the three bacterial isolates chosen for further analysis.. Among 67 compounds tentatively identified from bacteria isolates, 52 were also found in the anal sac secretion.\\n\\nWe show that the bacterial community in the anal sac consists primarily of only a few abundant taxa and that isolates of these taxa produce numerous volatiles that are found in the combined anal sac volatile profile. Many of these volatiles are found in anal sac secretions from other carnivorans, and are also associated with known bacterial biosynthesis pathways. This supports the fermentation hypothesis and the idea that the anal sac is maintained at least in part to house bacteria that produce volatiles for the host.",

    "abstract": "Hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (HPH) is a lethal disease. CircRNAs and m6A circRNAs have been reported to be associated with cancer progression, but the expression profiling of m6A circRNAs has not been identified in HPH. This study was to investigate the transcriptome-wide map of m6A circRNAs in HPH. In this study, hypoxia-induced PH rat model was established. Total RNA was extracted and purified from lungs of rats, then circRNAs were detected and annotated by RNA-seq analysis. m6A RNA Immunoprecipitation (MeRIP) was performed following rRNA depletion, and RNA-seq library was constructed. CircRNA-miRNA-mRNA co-expression network was also constructed. In vitro, total m6A was measured. m6A circXpo6 and m6A circTmtc3 were detected in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) and pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs) exposed to 21% O2 and 1% O2 for 48 h, respectively. m6A abundance in 166 circRNAs was significantly upregulated and m6A abundance in 191 circRNAs was significantly downregulated in lungs of HPH rats. m6A abundance in circRNAs was significantly reduced in hypoxia in vitro. m6A circRNAs were mainly derived from single exons of protein-coding genes. m6A influenced the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA co-expression network in hypoxia. m6A circXpo6 and m6A circTmtc3 were downregulated in hypoxia. In general, our study firstly identified the transcriptome-wide map of m6A circRNAs in HPH. m6A level in circRNAs was decreased in lungs of HPH rats and in PASMCs and PAECs exposed to hypoxia. Downregulated or upregulated m6A level influenced circRNA-miRNA-mRNA co-expression network in HPH. Moreover, we firstly identified two downregulated m6A circRNAs in HPH: circXpo6 and circTmtc3. We suggested that m6A circRNAs may be used as a potential diagnostic marker or therapy target in the future.\\n\\nAuthor summaryHPH is a disease with great morbidity and mortality. It is often caused by chronic hypoxic lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and interstitial lung diseases. It lacks effective therapy methods so far. CircRNAs are a type of non-coding RNAs and can be used as biomarkers because they are differentially enriched in specific cell types or tissues and not easily degraded. m6A is identified as the most universal modification on non-coding RNAs in eukaryotes. CircRNAs can be modified by m6A. m6A circRNAs in HPH is not well understood yet. Here we identify the transcriptome-wide map of m6A circRNAs in HPH. We elucidate that m6A level in circRNAs is decreased in lungs of HPH rats and in PASMCs and PAECs exposed to hypoxia. We find that downregulated or upregulated m6A level influences circRNA- miRNA-mRNA co-expression network in HPH. Moreover, we are the first to identify two downregulated m6A circRNAs in HPH: circXpo6 and circTmtc3. We suggest that m6A circRNAs may be used as a potential diagnostic marker or therapy target in the future.",

    "abstract": "Food borne illnesses have a world-wide economic impact and industries are continuously developing technologies to reduce the spread of disease caused by microorganisms. Antimicrobial growth promoters (AGPs) have been used to decrease microbiological infections in animals and their potential transfer to humans. In recent years there has been a global trend to remove AGPs from animal feed in an attempt to reduce the spread of antimicrobial resistant genes into the human population. Phytobiotics, such as oregano powder, are one of the potential replacements for AGPs due to their well-established antimicrobial components. 16S rRNA gene amplicons were used to determine the effect of oregano powder (1% w/v) on the microbiota of mixed bacterial cell cultures, which were obtained from the ceca of traditionally grown meat chickens (broilers). Oregano powder had a mild effect on the microbial cell cultures increasing Enterococcus faecium, rearranging ratios of members in the genus Lactobacillus and significantly reducing the genus Streptococcus (p=1.6e-3). Beneficial short chain fatty acids (SCFA), acetic and butyric acid, were also significantly increased in oregano powder supplemented cultures. These results suggest that oregano powder at a concentration of 1 % (w/v) may have beneficial influences on mixed microbial communities and SCFA production.",

Thus, the objective of this study was to identify miRNAs selectively expressed in HCC with gross VI and investigate their prognostic significance.\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsEligible two datasets (accession number: GSE20594 and GSE67140) were collected from the National Center for Biotechnology Informations (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to compare miRNAs expression between HCC with and without gross VI. Differentially expressed miRNAs were externally validated using expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Prognostic significance and predicted functions of selected miRNAs for HCC were also investigated.\\n\\nResultsThirty-five miRNAs were differentially expressed between HCC with and without gross VI in both datasets. Among them, four miRNAs were validated using TCGA database. miR-582 was upregulated to a greater extent while miR-99a, miR-100, and miR-148a were downregulated to a greater extent in patients with HCC and gross VI than in those with HCC but no VI. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed discriminatory power of these miRNAs in predicting gross VI. Multivariate survival analysis revealed that types of surgery, advanced tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage, and miR-100 underexpression were independently associated with tumor recurrence. It also revealed that types of surgery, advanced TNM stage, miR-100 underexpression, and miR-582 overexpression were independent risk factors for overall survival (OS) after hepatic resection for HCC. A text mining analysis revealed that these miRNAs were linked to multifaceted hallmarks of cancer, including \\\"invasion and metastasis.\\\"\\n\\nConclusionsmiR-100 underexpression and miR-582 overexpression were associated with gross VI and poor survival of patients after hepatic resection for HCC.",

The production of glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) is essential in humans, yeast, and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. In addition, GPI-APs perform many important roles for cells. In this study, we characterized the B. malayi GPI-anchored proteome using both computational and experimental approaches. We used bioinformatic strategies to show the presence or absence of B. malayi GPI-AP biosynthetic pathway genes and to compile a putative B. malayi GPI-AP proteome using available prediction programs. We verified these in silico analyses using proteomics to identify GPI-AP candidates prepared from the surface of intact worms and from membrane enriched extracts. Our study represents the first description of the GPI-anchored proteome in B. malayi and lays the groundwork for further exploration of this essential protein modification as a target for novel anthelmintic therapeutic strategies.",

The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to observe the bacterial cell morphology followed by each drug alone and in combination, elucidating the possible result of antibiotic combination therapy. The Galleria mellonella infection model was constructed to demonstrate the in vivo efficacy of linezolid plus fosfomycin for VSE and VRE infection.\\n\\nResultsThe fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) values of all strains suggested that linezolid showed synergy or additivity in combination with fosfomycin against five of the six strains. Time-kill experiments demonstrated that the combination of linezolid-fosfomycin at 1xMIC or 2xMIC led to higher degree of bacterial killing without regrowth for all isolates tested than each monotherapy. TEM imaging showed that the combination treatment damaged the bacterial cell morphology more obviously than each drug alone. In the Galleria mellonella infection model, the enhanced survival rate of the combination treatment was revealed compared to linezolid monotherapy (P<0.05).\\n\\nConclusionsOur data manifest that the combination of linezolid and fosfomycin may be a possible therapeutic regimen for VRE infection.

This method accumulates the most motile sperm in the upper fraction and leaves sperm with low or no motility in the lower fraction but the underlying reasons are not fully understood. In this article, we compare metabolic rate, motility and sperm tail length of bovine sperm cells of the upper and lower fraction. The metabolic assay platform reveals oxygen consumption rates and extracellular acidification rates simultaneously and thereby delivers the metabolic rates in real time. Our study confirms the upper fraction of bull sperm has improved motility compared to the cells in the lower fraction and shows higher metabolic rates. This pattern was consistent across media of two different levels of viscosity. Sperm with longer flagella are selected in the upper fraction. We conclude that the motility-based separation of the swim-up technique is based on metabolic differences. Metabolic assays could serve as additional or alternative, label-free method to evaluate sperm quality, which is likely particularly useful in cases of asthenozoospermia and teratospermia. Furthermore, metabolic measurements of sperm cells can reveal differences in metabolic pathways in different environments.",

    "abstract": "Persisters constitute a subpopulation of bacteria that can tolerate lethal concentrations of antibiotics. Multiple mechanisms have been suggested for bacterial persistence against antibiotics. With mycobacteria being no exception to this behaviour, we had reported the de novo emergence of genetically antibiotic-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis from persister cells upon prolonged exposure to microbicidal concentrations of the anti-tuberculosis drugs, rifampicin and moxifloxacin. Here, we present evidence for reduced permeability to rifampicin as a mechanism for persistence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in vitro. We observed that rifampicin persistent M. tuberculosis cells developed a thick outer layer (TOL) capsule. The TOL restricted the entry of fluorochrome-conjugated rifampicin, 5-carboxyfluorescein-rifampicin (5-FAM-rifampicin), which retained only 2.5% of its original bactericidal activity, but high levels of permeability, on actively growing mid-log phase cells. Gentle mechanical removal of TOL significantly enhanced 5-FAM-rifampicin entry into the persister cells. The level of 5-FAM-rifampicin in the persister cells was not affected by the pre-incubation of the cells with verapamil, a drug efflux pump inhibitor, ruling out the involvement of efflux pumps in the reduced intracellular concentration of 5-FAM-rifampicin. GC-MS analysis of TOL showed the presence of [~]7-fold, [~]5-fold and [~]2- fold higher levels of -D-glucopyranoside, 1,2,5-linked-mannitol, and 3,4-linked mannose, respectively, among [~]2-fold higher levels of derivatives of several other types of sugars such as arabinose and galactose. Taken together, the present study reveals that rifampicin-persistent M. tuberculosis cells develop TOL that enables the bacilli to restrict entry of rifampicin and thereby remain tolerant to the antibiotic in vitro.",

    "abstract": "Laboratory strains of Bacillus subtilis encodes as many as 16 alternative sigma factors, each dedicated to expressing a unique regulon such as those involved in stress resistance, sporulation, and motility. The ancestral strain of B. subtilis also encodes an additional sigma factor homolog, ZpdN, not found in lab strains due to it being encoded on the large, low copy number plasmid pBS32 that was lost during domestication. DNA damage triggers pBS32 hyper-replication and cell death in a manner that depends on ZpdN but how ZpdN mediates these effects was unknown. Here we show that ZpdN is a bona fide sigma factor that can direct RNA polymerase to transcribe ZpdN-dependent genes and we rename ZpdN to SigN accordingly. Rend-seq analysis was used to determine the SigN regulon on pBS32, and the 5 ends of transcripts were used to predict the SigN consensus sequence. Finally, we characterize the regulation of SigN itself, and show that it is transcribed by at least three promoters: PsigN1, a strong SigA-dependent LexA-repressed promoter, PsigN2, a weak SigA-dependent constitutive promoter, and PsigN3, a SigN-dependent promoter. Thus, in response to DNA damage LexA is derepressed, SigN is expressed and then experiences positive feedback. How cells die in a pBS32-dependent manner remains unknown, but we predict that death is the product of expressing one or more genes in the SigN regulon.\\n\\nIMPORTANCESigma factors are utilized by bacteria to control and regulate gene expression. Extra cytoplasmic function sigma factors are activated during times of stress to ensure the survival of the bacterium.

    "abstract": "Biological organisms that sequentially experience multiple environments develop self-organized representations of the stimuli unique to each; moreover, these representations are retained long-term, and sometimes utilize overlapping sets of neurons. This functionality is difficult to replicate in silico for several reasons, such as the tradeoff between stability, which enables retention, and plasticity, which enables ongoing learning. Here, by using a network that leverages an ensemble of neuromimetic mechanisms, I successfully simulate multi-environment learning; additionally, from measurements of synapse states and stimulus recognition performance taken at multiple time points, the following network features emerge as particularly important to its operation. First, while reinforcement-driven stabilization preserves the synapses most important to the representation of each stimulus, pruning eliminates many of the rest, thereby resulting in low-noise representations. Second, in familiar environments, a low baseline rate of exploratory synapse generation balances with pruning to confer plasticity without introducing significant noise; meanwhile, in novel environments, new synapses are reinforced, reinforcement-driven spine generation promotes further exploration, and learning is hastened. Thus, reinforcement-driven spine generation allows the network to temporally separate its pursuit of pruning and plasticity objectives. Third, the permanent synapses interfere with the learning of new environments; but, stimulus competition and long-term depression mitigate this effect; and, even when weakened, the permanent synapses enable the rapid relearning of the representations to which they correspond. This exhibition of memory suppression and rapid recovery is notable because of its biological analogs, and because this biologically-viable strategy for reducing interference would not be favored by artificial objective functions unaccommodating of brief performance lapses. Together, these modeling results advance understanding of intelligent systems by demonstrating the emergence of system-level operations and naturalistic learning outcomes from component-level features, and by showcasing strategies for finessing system design tradeoffs.",
