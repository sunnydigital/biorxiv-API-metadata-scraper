    "abstract": "Plant growth, development, and nutritional quality depends upon amino acid homeostasis, especially in seeds. However, our understanding of the underlying genetics influencing amino acid content and composition remains limited, with only a few candidate genes and quantitative trait loci identified to date. Improved knowledge of the genetics and biological processes that determine amino acid levels will enable researchers to use this information for plant breeding and biological discovery. Towards this goal, we used genomic prediction to identify biological processes that are associated with, and therefore potentially influence, free amino acid (FAA) composition in seeds of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Markers were split into categories based on metabolic pathway annotations and fit using a genomic partitioning model to evaluate the influence of each pathway on heritability explained, model fit, and predictive ability. Selected pathways included processes known to influence FAA composition, albeit to an unknown degree, and spanned four categories: amino acid, core, specialized, and protein metabolism. Using this approach, we identified associations for pathways containing known variants for FAA traits, in addition to finding new trait-pathway associations. Markers related to amino acid metabolism, which are directly involved in the FAA regulation, improved predictive ability for branched chain amino acids and histidine. The use of genomic partitioning also revealed patterns across biochemical families, in which serine-derived FAAs were associated with protein related annotations and aromatic FAAs were associated with specialized metabolic pathways. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that genomic partitioning is a viable strategy to uncover the relative contributions of biological processes to FAA traits in seeds, offering a promising framework to guide hypothesis testing and narrow the search space for candidate genes.",

    "abstract": "Background: Just as substance use disorders (SUDs), gambling disorder (GD) is characterized by an increase in cue-dependent decision-making (similar to Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer, PIT). PIT, as studied in SUDs and healthy subjects, is associated with altered communication between Nucleus Accumbens (NAcc), amygdala, and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). These neural differences are, however, poorly understood. For example, it is unclear whether they are due to the physiological effects of substance abuse, or rather related to learning processes and/or other etiological factors like innate traits associated with addiction. We have thus investigated whether network activation patterns during a PIT task are also altered in GD, an addictive disorder not involving substance abuse. We have specifically studied which neural PIT patterns were best at distinguishing GD from HC subjects, all to improve our understanding of the neural signatures of GD and of addiction-related PIT in general. Methods: 30 GD and 30 HC subjects completed an affective decision-making task in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner. Gambling associated and other emotional cues were shown in the background during the task, allowing us to record multivariate neural PIT signatures focusing on a network of NAcc, amygdala and OFC. We built and tested a classifier based on these multivariate neural PIT signatures using cross-validated elastic net regression. Results and Discussion: As expected, GD subjects showed stronger PIT than HC subjects because they showed stronger increase in gamble acceptance when gambling cues were presented in the background. Classification based on neural PIT signatures yielded a significant AUC-ROC (0.70, p = 0.013). When inspecting the features of the classifier, we observed that GD showed stronger PIT-related functional connectivity between NAcc and amygdala elicited by gambling background cues, as well as between amygdala and OFC elicited by negative and positive cues. Conclusion: We propose that HC and GD subjects are distinguishable by PIT-related neural signatures including amygdala-NAcc-OFC functional connectivity. Our findings suggest that neural PIT alterations in addictive disorders might not depend on the physiological effect of a substance of abuse, but on related learning processes or even innate neural traits, also found in behavioral addictions.",

To date, preferentially regenerating T lymphopoiesis in vivo from pluripotent stem cells (PSC) remains a practical challenge. Here we documented that synergistic and transient expression of Runx1 and Hoxa9 restricted in the time window of endothelial to hematopoietic transition and hematopoietic maturation stages induced in vitro from PSC (iR9-PSC) preferentially generated engraftable hematopoietic progenitors capable of homing to thymus and developing into mature T (iT) cells in primary and secondary immunodeficient recipients. Single-cell transcriptome and functional analyses illustrated the cellular trajectory of T lineage induction from PSC, unveiling the T-lineage specification determined at as early as hemogenic endothelial cell stage and identifying the bona fide pre-thymic progenitors. The iT cells distributed normally in central and peripheral lymphoid organs and exhibited abundant TCR{beta} repertoire. The regenerative T lymphopoiesis rescued the immune-surveillance ability in immunodeficient mice. Furthermore, gene-edited iR9-PSC produced tumor-specific-T cells in vivo that effectively eradicated tumor cells. This study provides insight into universal generation of functional and therapeutic T lymphopoiesis from the unlimited and editable PSC source.",

    "abstract": "Crosstalk between malignant and neighboring cells contributes to tumor growth. In East Asia, infection with fish-borne liver flukes is a major risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). The parasite secretes a growth factor termed liver fluke granulin (Ov-GRN-1), a homologue of the human progranulin (huPGRN), which contributes significantly to biliary tract fibrosis and morbidity during infection. Here, exosome-mediated transfer of mRNAs from the human cholangiocyte cell line (H69) was investigated following exposure to Ov-GRN-1, to naive recipient H69 cells. To minimize the influence of endogenous huPGRN, the gene encoding huPGRN was inactivated using CRISPR/Cas9-based gene knock-out. Several huPGRN-depleted cell lines, termed {Delta}huPGRN-H69, were established. These lines exhibited >80% reductions in levels of huPGRN transcripts and protein, both in gene-edited cells and within exosomes released by these cells. Profiles of exosomal RNAs (exRNA) from {Delta}huPGRN-H69 for CCA-associated characteristics revealed a paucity of transcripts for estrogen- and Wnt-signaling pathways, peptidase inhibitors and tyrosine phosphatase related to cellular processes including oncogenic transformation. Several CCA-specific mRNAs including MAPK/AKT pathway members were induced by exposure to Ov-GRN-1. By comparison, estrogen, Wnt/PI3K and TGF signaling and other CCA pathway mRNAs were upregulated in wild type H69 exposed to Ov-GRN-1. Of these, CCA-associated exRNAs modified the CCA microenvironment in naive recipient cells co-cultured with exosomes from {Delta}huPGRN-H69 exposed to Ov-GRN-1, and induced translation of MAPK phosphorylation related-protein in naive recipient cells comparing with control recipient cells. Exosome-mediated crosstalk in response to liver fluke granulin promoted a CCA-specific program through MAPK pathway which, in turn, established a CCA-conducive disposition.",

    "abstract": "Mutations mediated by the APOBEC3 (A3) family of single-strand specific cytosine deaminases can accumulate in various cancers, as strand-coordinated clusters and isolated lesions. A3-mediated mutations also occur during normal development, accounting for ~20% of heritable mutations. A3B is an archetypical member of this family and is thought to contribute to both cancer initiation and progression. A3B has a strong preference for C in a TC context and catalyzes hydrolysis of the primary amine of un-paired C to generate U. Subsequent repair generates a distinctive pattern of C-substitutions, which along with their context signify their A3B origin. Although single-stranded DNA is the preferred A3B substrate, we report here that in some instances A3B can deaminate the C of TC in a double-stranded DNA context in vitro. These include C paired to O6-methylguanine (O6meG), to an abasic (AP) site, or to a G adjacent to an AP site. AP sites are the most common lesion in DNA, and O6meG levels increase under alkylating conditions caused by environmental nitrosamines and some chemotherapeutic agents. We also show that elevated expression of A3B can enhance double-stranded breaks induced by the alkylating agent MNNG in mammalian cells, but this effect does not require A3B deaminase activity.",

    "abstract": "Steryl esters (SEs) are important storage compounds in many eukaryotes and are often prominent components of intracellular lipid droplets. Here we demonstrate that selected Actino- and Proteobacteria growing on sterols are also able to synthesize SEs and to sequester them in cytoplasmic lipid droplets. We found cholesteryl ester (CE) formation in members of the actinobacterial genera Rhodococcus, Mycobacterium, and Amycolatopsis as well as several members of the proteobacterial Cellvibrionales order. CEs maximally accumulated under nitrogen-limiting conditions, suggesting that steryl ester formation plays a crucial role for storing excess energy and carbon under adverse conditions. Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 was able to synthesize phytosteryl- and cholesteryl esters, the latter reaching up to 7% of its cellular dry weight and 69% of its lipid droplets. Purified lipid droplets from RHA1 contained CEs, free cholesterol and triacylglycerols. In addition, we found formation of CEs in Mycobacterium tuberculosis when grown with cholesterol plus an additional fatty acid substrate. This study provides a basis for the application of bacterial whole cell systems in the biotechnological production of SEs for use in functional foods and cosmetics.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEOleaginous bacteria exhibit great potential for the production of high-value neutral lipids, such as triacylglycerols and wax esters. This study describes the formation of steryl esters (SEs) as neutral lipid storage compounds in sterol-degrading oleaginous bacteria, providing a basis for biotechnological production of SEs using bacterial systems with potential applications in the functional food, nutraceutical, and cosmetic industries. We found cholesteryl ester (CE) formation in several sterol-degrading Actino- and Proteobacteria under nitrogen limiting conditions, suggesting an important role of this process in storing energy and carbon under adverse conditions.

No significant differentiation was found between wild and cultivated chestnut. A genetic structure analysis with no a priori information found a low, yet significant structure, and identified two clusters. One cluster gathers trees from south-east France and Corsica (RPP1) and another cluster gathers trees from all other sampled regions (RPP2). A substructure was detected at 13 SSRs suggesting differentiation within both RPP1 and RPP2. RPP1 was split between south-east France and Corsica. RPP2 was split between north-west France, Aveyron, Pyrenees and a last cluster gathering individuals from several other regions.\n\nConclusionThe genetic structure within and between our sampling regions is likely the result of natural events (recolonization after the last glaciation) and human activities (migration and exchanges). Notably, we provide evidence for a common origin of most French and Iberian chestnut trees, except those from south-east France that were associated with the Italian gene pool. This advances our knowledge of chestnut genetic diversity and structure, will benefit conservation and help our local partners valorization efforts.",

To permit a wide variety of specimens to be imaged, each microscope-twin provides flexible imaging parameters, including (i) operation in one-photon and/or two-photon excitation modes, (ii) delivery of one to three light-sheets via a trio of orthogonal excitation arms, (iii) sub-micron to micron imaging resolution, (iv) multicolor compatibility, and (v) upright and/or inverted detection geometry. We offer a detailed description of the flex-SPIM design to aid instrument builders who wish to construct and use similar systems.

    "abstract": "MICU1 is an EF-hand-containing mitochondrial protein that is essential for gating of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter channel (mtCU) and is reported to interact directly with the pore-forming subunit, MCU and scaffold EMRE. However, using size-exclusion proteomics, we found that MICU1 exists in mitochondrial complexes lacking MCU. This suggests that MICU1 may have additional cellular functions independent of regulating mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. To discern mtCU-independent MICU1 functions, we employed a proteomic discovery approach using BioID2-mediated proximity-based (<10nm) biotinylation and subsequent LC-MS detection. The expression of a MICU1-BioID2 fusion protein in MICU1-/- and MCU-/- cells allowed the identification of total vs. mtCU-independent MICU1 interactors. Bioinformatics identified the Mitochondrial Contact Site and Cristae Organizing System (MICOS) components MIC60 (encoded by the IMMT gene) and Coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil helix domain containing 2 (CHCHD2) as novel MICU1 interactors, independent of the mtCU. We demonstrate that MICU1 is essential for proper proteomic organization of the MICOS complex and that MICU1 ablation results in altered cristae organization and mitochondrial ultrastructure. We hypothesize that MICU1 serves as a MICOS calcium sensor, since perturbing MICU1 is sufficient to modulate cytochrome c release independent of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake across the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). Here, we provide the first experimental evidence suggesting that MICU1 regulates cellular functions independent of mitochondrial calcium uptake and may serve as a critical mediator of Ca2+-dependent signaling to modulate mitochondrial membrane dynamics and cristae organization.",

    "abstract": "SynGAP is a postsynaptic density (PSD) protein that binds to PDZ domains of the scaffold protein PSD-95. We previously reported that heterozygous deletion of synGAP in mice is correlated with increased steady-state levels of other key PSD proteins that bind PSD-95, although the level of PSD-95 remains constant (Walkup et al., 2016). For example, the ratio to PSD-95 of Transmembrane AMPA-Receptor-associated Proteins (TARPs), which mediate binding of AMPA-type glutamate receptors to PSD-95, was increased in young synGAP+/- mice. Here we show that a highly significant increase in TARP in the PSDs of young synGAP+/- rodents is present only in females and not in males. The data reveal a sex difference in the adaptation of the PSD scaffold to synGAP heterozygosity.",

Here, we report an unexpected function of TDP-43 in the formation of dynamic, reversible, liquid droplet-like nuclear bodies (NBs) in response to stress. Formation of NBs alleviates TDP-43-mediated cytotoxicity in mammalian cells and fly neurons. Super-resolution microscopy reveals a \"core-shell\" organization of TDP-43 NBs, antagonistically maintained by the two RRMs. TDP-43 NBs are partially colocalized with nuclear paraspeckles, whose scaffolding lncRNA NEAT1 is dramatically upregulated in stressed neurons. Moreover, increase of NEAT1 promotes TDP-43 liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in vitro. Finally, we uncover that the ALS-associated mutation D169G impairs the NEAT1-mediated TDP-43 LLPS and NB assembly, causing excessive cytoplasmic translocation of TDP-43 to form stress granules that become phosphorylated TDP-43 cytoplasmic foci upon prolonged stress. Together, our findings suggest a stress-mitigating role and mechanism of TDP-43 NBs, whose dysfunction may be involved in ALS pathogenesis.",
