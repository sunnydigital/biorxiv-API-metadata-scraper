    "abstract": "Consistent individual differences in behaviour (animal personality) are widespread throughout the Animal Kingdom. This includes variation in risk-taking versus risk-averse behavioural tendencies. Variation in several personality dimensions is associated with distinct fitness consequences and thus, may become a target of natural and/or sexual selection. However, the link between animal personality and mate choice--as a major component of sexual selection--remains understudied. We asked (1) whether females and males of the livebearing fish Poecilia mexicana prefer risk-taking mating partners (directional mating preference), (2) or if their preferences are dependent on the choosing individuals own personality type (assortative mating). We characterized each test subject for its risk-taking behaviour, assessed as the time to emerge from shelter and enter an unknown area. In dichotomous association preference tests, we offered two potential mating partners that differed in risk-taking behaviour but were matched for other phenotypic traits (body size, shape, and colouration). Females, but not males, exhibited a strong directional preference for risk-taking over risk-averse mating partners. At the same time, the strength of females preferences correlated positively with their own risk-taking scores. Our study is the first to demonstrate that a strong overall preference for risk-taking mating partners does not preclude effects of choosing individuals own personality type on (subtle) individual variation in mating preferences. More generally, two different preferences functions appear to interact to determine the outcome of individual mate choice decisions.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodesmata (PD) are crucial structures for intercellular communication in multicellular plants with remorins being their crucial plant-specific structural and functional constituents. The PD biogenesis is an intriguing but poorly understood process. By expressing an Arabidopsis remorin protein in mammalian cells, we have reconstituted a PD-like filamentous structure, termed remorin filament (RF), connecting neighboring cells physically and physiologically. Notably, RFs are capable of transporting macromolecules intercellularly, in a way similar to plant PD. With further super-resolution microscopic analysis and biochemical characterization, we found that RFs are also composed of actin filaments, forming the core skeleton structure, aligned with the remorin protein. This unique heterologous filamentous structure might explain the molecular mechanism for remorin function as well as PD construction. Furthermore, remorin protein exhibits a specific distribution manner in the plasma membrane in mammalian cells, representing a lipid nanodomain, depending on its lipid modification status. Our studies not only provide crucial insights into the mechanism of PD biogenesis, but also uncovers unsuspected fundamental mechanistic and evolutionary links between intercellular communication systems of plants and animals.\n\nSignificanceRemorin is rising as a crucial lipid microdomain marker, as well as an essential component of plasmodesmata in plants. However, the biological role of remorin in plants is elusive. With a heterologous system, we found that remorin expression is able to form intercellular filamentous structure, namely remorin filament (RF), connecting neighboring mammalian cells functionally. By employing multiple approaches, we tested the functionality of RFs, as well as investigated their structures. RFs highly resemble plant plasmodesmata, in many ways, such as its morphology, molecular constitutes, and its ability to transport macromolecules intercellularly. Our study provides novel insights into the biogenesis of plasmodesmata and uncovers fundamental evolutionary links in molecular construction of intercellular connections in both plants and animals.",

    "abstract": "Biologists use optical microscopes to study plankton in the lab, but their size, complexity and cost makes widespread deployment of microscopes in lakes and oceans challenging. Monitoring the morphology, behavior and distribution of plankton in situ is essential as they are excellent indicators of marine environment health and provide a majority of Earths oxygen and carbon sequestration. Direct in-line holographic microscopy (DIHM) eliminates many of these obstacles, but image reconstruction is computationally intensive and produces monochromatic images. By using one laser and one white LED, it is possible to obtain the 3D location plankton by triangulation, limiting holographic reconstruction to only the voxels occupied by the plankton, reducing computation by several orders of magnitude. The color information from the white LED assists in the classification of plankton, as phytoplankton contains green-colored chlorophyll. The reconstructed plankton images are rendered in a 3D interactive environment, viewable from a browser, providing the user the experience of observing plankton from inside a drop of water.",

    "abstract": "Gut microbiome analysis using 16S rRNA frequently focuses on summary statistics (e.g. diversity) or single taxonomic scales (e.g. Operational Taxonomic units, OTUs). This approach risks misinterpreting the phylogenetic or abundance scales of community differences (e.g. over-emphasising the role of single strains). We therefore constructed a 16S phylogenetic tree from mouse stool and colonic mucus communities. Random forest models, of all 428,234 clades, tested community differences among niches (stool versus mucus), host ages (6 versus 18 weeks), genotypes (wildtype versus colitis prone-mdr1a-/-) and social groups (co-housed siblings). Models discriminated all criteria except host genotype, where no community differences were found. Host social groups differed in abundant, low-level, taxa whereas intermediate phylogenetic and abundance scales distinguished ages and niches. Thus, treating evolutionary clades of microbes equivalently without reference to OTUs or taxonomy, clearly identifies whether and how gut microbial communities are distinct and provides a novel way to define functionally important bacteria.",

    "abstract": "A recent genome-wide screen identified [~]300 essential or growth-supporting genes in the dental caries pathogen Streptococcus mutans. To be able to study these genes, we built a CRISPR interference tool around the Cas9 nuclease (Cas9Smu) encoded in the S. mutans UA159 genome. Using a xylose-inducible dead Cas9Smu with a constitutively active single-guide RNA (sgRNA), we observed titratable repression of GFP fluorescence that compared favorably to that of Streptococcus pyogenes dCas9 (Cas9Spy). We then investigated sgRNA specificity and proto-spacer adjacent motif (PAM) requirements. Interference by sgRNAs did not occur with double or triple base-pair mutations, or if single base-pair mutations were in the 3 end of the sgRNA. Bioinformatic analysis of >450 S. mutans genomes allied with in vivo assays revealed a similar PAM recognition sequence as the Cas9Spy. Next, we created a comprehensive library of sgRNA plasmids that were directed at essential and growth-supporting genes. We discovered growth defects for 77% of the CRISPRi strains expressing sgRNAs. Phenotypes of CRISPRi strains, across several biological pathways, were assessed using fluorescence microscopy. A variety of cell structure anomalies were observed, including segregational instability of the chromosome, enlarged cells, and ovococci-to-rod shape transitions. CRISPRi was also employed to observe how silencing of cell wall glycopolysaccharide biosynthesis (rhamnose-glucose polysaccharide, RGP) affected both cell division and pathogenesis in a wax worm model. The CRISPRi tool and sgRNA library are valuable resources for characterizing essential genes in S. mutans, some of which could prove to be promising therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Influenza B virus undergoes seasonal antigenic drift more slowly than influenza A, but the reasons for this difference are unclear. While the evolutionary dynamics of influenza viruses play out globally, they are fundamentally driven by mutation, reassortment, drift, and selection within individual hosts. These processes have recently been described for influenza A virus, but little is known about the evolutionary dynamics of influenza B virus (IBV) at the level of individual infections and transmission events. Here we define the within-host evolutionary dynamics of influenza B virus by sequencing virus populations from naturally-infected individuals enrolled in a prospective, community-based cohort over 8176 person-seasons of observation. Through analysis of high depth-of-coverage sequencing data from samples from 91 individuals with influenza B, we find that influenza B virus accumulates lower genetic diversity than previously observed for influenza A virus during acute infections. Consistent with studies of influenza A viruses, the within-host evolution of influenza B viruses is characterized by purifying selection and the general absence of widespread positive selection of within-host variants. Analysis of shared genetic diversity across 15 sequence-validated transmission pairs suggests that IBV experiences a tight transmission bottleneck similar to that of influenza A virus. These patterns of local-scale evolution are consistent with influenza B virus slower global evolutionary rate.\\n\\nImportanceThe evolution of influenza virus is a significant public health problem and necessitates the annual evaluation of influenza vaccine formulation to keep pace with viral escape from herd immunity. Influenza B virus is a serious health concern for children, in particular, yet remains understudied compared to influenza A virus. Influenza B virus evolves more slowly than influenza A, but the factors underlying this are not completely understood. We studied how the within-host diversity of influenza B virus relates to its global evolution by sequencing viruses from a community-based cohort. We found that influenza B virus populations have lower within-host genetic diversity than influenza A virus and experience a tight genetic bottleneck during transmission. Our work provides insights into the varying dynamics of influenza viruses in human infection.",

    "abstract": "Childhood maltreatment is among the most robust risk factors for subsequent psychiatric and medical disorders, and data in humans and rodents suggest that effects of adverse childhood experiences may be transmitted across generations. Recent indications for biological processes underlying this transfer of experiential effects are intriguing; yet, their relevance in primates is inconclusive due to limitations of current studies. In this study, we bridge research in rodent models and humans with a natural non-human primate model on intergenerational effects of childhood maltreatment. Using a unique, well-controlled, randomized cross-fostering design in rhesus monkeys, we test the influence of ancestral maltreatment on molecular, neuroendocrine and behavioral outcomes in offspring, and show that childhood maltreatment results in transmission of information to the subsequent generation independent of behavioral transmission. We further demonstrate differences in the offspring longitudinal DNA methylation profile of the FKBP5 gene, an important regulator of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis in offspring of the maltreatment lineage compared to the control lineage. Finally, we show that differences in FKBP5 methylation have functional effects on molecular, neuroendocrine and behavioral outcomes in offspring of the maltreatment ancestral line, even if the infants were never exposed to maltreatment nor interacted with their exposed ancestors. Although the molecular mechanism underlying our observations remains unknown, our data point to a potential germline-dependent effect. In summary, our data suggest that history of maltreatment in primates can induce molecular and behavioral changes in a subsequent generation independent of behavioral transmission that may influence risk for mental and physical diseases across generations.",

    "abstract": "The visual system is thought to separate egocentric and allocentric representations, but behavioral experiments show that these codes are optimally integrated to influence goal-directed movements. To test if frontal cortex participates in this integration process, we recorded primate frontal eye field (FEF) activity during a cue-conflict memory delay saccade task. To dissociate egocentric and allocentric coordinates, we surreptitiously shifted a visual landmark during the delay period, causing saccades to deviate by 37% in the same direction. To assess the cellular mechanisms, we fit neural response fields against an egocentric (eye centered target-to-gaze) continuum, and an allocentric shift (eye-to-landmark centered) continuum. Initial visual responses best fit target position. Motor responses (after the landmark shift) predicted future gaze position but embedded within the motor code was a 29% shift toward allocentric coordinates. This shift appeared transiently in memory-related visuomotor activity, and then reappeared in motor activity before saccades. Notably, fits along the egocentric and allocentric shift continua were initially independent, but became correlated just before the motor burst. Overall, these results implicate frontal cortex in the integration of egocentric and allocentric visual information for goal-directed action, and demonstrate the cell-specific, temporal progression of signal multiplexing for this process in the gaze system.",

    "abstract": "Evidence suggests that mindfulness meditation (MM) improves selective attention and reduces distractibility by enhancing top-down neural modulation. Altered P300 and alpha neural activity from MM have been identified and may reflect the neural changes that underpin these improvements. Given the proposed role of alpha activity in supressing processing of task-irrelevant information, it is theorised that altered alpha activity may underlie increased availability of neural resources in meditators. The present study investigated attentional function in meditators using a cross-modal study design, examining the P300 during working memory (WM) and alpha activity during concurrent distracting tactile stimuli. Thirty-three meditators and 27 healthy controls participated in the study. Meditators showed a more frontal distribution of P300 neural activity following WM stimuli (p = 0.005, {eta}{superscript 2} = 0.060) and more modulation of alpha activity at parietal-occipital regions between single (tactile stimulation only) and dual task demands (tactile stimulation plus WM task) (p < 0.001, {eta}{superscript 2} = 0.065). Additionally, meditators performed more accurately than controls (p = 0.038, {eta}{superscript 2} = 0.067). The altered distribution of neural activity concurrent with improved WM performance suggests greater attentional resources dedicated to task related functions such as WM in meditators. Thus, meditation-related neural changes are likely multi-faceted involving both altered distribution and also amplitudes of brain activity, enhancing attentional processes depending on task requirements.",

    "abstract": "Many systems in biology and beyond employ collaborative, collective communication strategies for improved efficiency and adaptive benefit. One such paradigm of particular interest is the community estimation of a dynamic signal, when, for example, an epithelial tissue of cells must decide whether to react to a given dynamic external concentration of stress signaling molecules. At the level of dynamic cellular communication, however, it remains unknown what effect, if any, arises from communication beyond the mean field level. What are the limits and benefits to communication across a network of neighbor interactions? What is the role of Poissonian vs. super Poissonian dynamics in such a setting? How does the particular topology of connections impact the collective estimation and that of the individual participating cells? In this letter we construct a robust and general framework of signal estimation over continuous time Markov chains in order to address and answer these questions. Our results show that in the case of Possonian estimators, the communication solely enhances convergence speed of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the estimators to their steady-state values while leaving these values unchanged. However, in the super-Poissonian regime, MSE of estimators significantly decreases by increasing the number of neighbors. Surprisingly, in this case, the clustering coefficient of an estimator does not enhance its MSE while reducing total MSE of the population.",

To mitigate against this threat with limited conservation resources, stakeholders must make decisions on where to focus anti-poaching activities. Identifying priority areas in a robust way allows decision-makers to target areas of conservation importance, therefore maximizing the impact of conservation interventions.\\n\\nLocationAnnamite mountains, Vietnam and Laos.\\n\\nMethodsWe conducted systematic landscape-scale surveys across five study sites (four protected areas, one unprotected area) using camera-trapping and leech-derived environmental DNA. We analyzed detections within a Bayesian multi-species occupancy framework to evaluate species responses to environmental and anthropogenic influences. Species responses were then used to predict occurrence to unsampled regions. We used predicted species richness maps and occurrence of endemic species to identify areas of conservation importance for targeted conservation interventions.\\n\\nResultsAnalyses showed that habitat-based covariates were uninformative. Our final model therefore incorporated three anthropogenic covariates as well as elevation, which reflects both ecological and anthropogenic factors. Conservation-priority species tended to found in areas that are more remote now or have been less accessible in the past, and at higher elevations. Predicted species richness was low and broadly similar across the sites, but slightly higher in the more remote site. Occupancy of the three endemic species showed a similar trend.\\n\\nMain conclusionIdentifying spatial patterns of biodiversity in heavily-defaunated landscapes may require novel methodological and analytical approaches. Our results indicate to build robust prediction maps it is beneficial to sample over large spatial scales, use multiple detection methods to increase detections for rare species, include anthropogenic covariates that capture different aspects of hunting pressure, and analyze data within a Bayesian multi-species framework. Our models further suggest that more remote areas should be prioritized for anti-poaching efforts to prevent the loss of rare and endemic species.",

    "abstract": "To date, there are very limited genetic studies conducted on the Kingdom of Bahrain and this is one of the first studies conducted to evaluate the 12 X-STRs included in the Investigator X-12 QS kit. Bahrain is a small archipelago located in the Arabian Gulf. X-STRs are very informative in population genetics studies, human identification and complex kinship analysis. One hundred and fifty-six (156) buccal swabs were collected using cotton from non-relatives Bahraini males from four different regions of Bahrain. DNA was processed using QIAsymphony SP instrument following quantification with Investigator Quantiplex HYres Kit in the 7500 Real-Time PCR System and detected in ABI 3500xl Genetic Analyzer. Analysis was done using different statistical softwares to obtain allele frequencies and haplotype frequencies-based upon the available four clusters of Linkage Groups (LGs)- and the forensic parameters.. Results indicated the diversity of the Bahraini population in terms of high Power of Discrimination (PD) and Probability of Match (PM) values obtained. The combined values of each forensic parameter such as cPDM, Mean exclusion chance (CMEC) Kruger, CMEC Kishida, and CMEC Desmarais as well as CMEC Desmarais Duo, were 0.9999983, 9999979, 0.9999939, 0.9999996 and 0.9999514 respectively based on the allele and haplotype frequencies. No shared profiles were observed. Number of non-standard alleles and null samples were obtained with more profoundly in locus DXS10148. We have conducted phylogenetic tree as well as multidimensional scale to analyze the Interpopulation diversity between Bahraini population and nine other populations and found out they reflect the geographical and social background of the region. Overall, the results confirm the importance of X-STRs in discriminating between individuals among Bahraini population and in establishing DNA databases for forensic and kinship studies.",

    "abstract": "Individual differences in pain perception are of key interest in basic and clinical research as altered pain sensitivity is both a characteristic and a risk factor for many pain conditions. It is, however, unclear how individual susceptibility to pain is reflected in the pain-free resting-state brain activity and functional connectivity.\\n\\nHere, we identified and validated a network pattern in the pain-free resting-state functional brain connectome that is predictive of interindividual differences in pain sensitivity. Our predictive network signature (https://spisakt.github.io/RPN-signature) allows assessing the individual susceptibility to pain without applying any painful stimulation, as might be valuable in patients where reliable behavioural pain reports cannot be obtained. Additionally, as a direct, non-invasive readout of the supraspinal neural contribution to pain sensitivity, it may have broad implications for translational research and the development and assessment of analgesic treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "Proprioceptive feedback is a critical component of voluntary movement planning and execution. Neuroprosthetic technologies aiming at restoring movement must interact with it to restore accurate motor control. Optimization and design of such technologies depends on the availability of quantitative insights into the neural dynamics of proprioceptive afferents during functional movements. However, recording proprioceptive neural activity during unconstrained movements in clinically relevant animal models presents formidable challenges. In this work, we developed a computational framework to estimate the spatiotemporal patterns of proprioceptive inputs to the cervical spinal cord during three-dimensional arm movements in monkeys. We extended a biomechanical model of the monkey arm with ex-vivo measurements, and combined it with models of mammalian group-Ia, Ib and II afferent fibers. We then used experimental recordings of arm kinematics and muscle activity of two monkeys performing a reaching and grasping task to estimate muscle stretches and forces with computational biomechanics. Finally, we projected the simulated proprioceptive firing rates onto the cervical spinal roots, thus obtaining spatiotemporal maps of spinal proprioceptive inputs during voluntary movements. Estimated maps show complex and markedly distinct patterns of neural activity for each of the fiber populations spanning the spinal cord rostro-caudally. Our results indicate that reproducing the proprioceptive information flow to the cervical spinal cord requires complex spatio-temporal modulation of each spinal root. Our model can support the design of neuroprosthetic technologies as well as in-silico investigations of the primate sensorimotor system.",

    "abstract": "Pulcherriminic acid, a cyclodipeptide, possesses the excellent antibacterial activities by chelating iron ions from environment, however, the low yield has hindered its application. In this study, high-level production of pulcherriminic acid was achieved by the multistep metabolic engineering of Bacillus licheniformis DWc9n*. Firstly, leucine (Leu) supply was increased by overexpressing the genes ilvBHC-leuABCD and ilvD involved in the Leu synthetic pathway and deleting the gene bkdAB encoding a branched-chain -keto acid dehydrogenase. The intracellular Leu content and pulcherriminic acid yield of strain W2 reached 147.4 mg/g DCW and 189.9 mg/L respectively, which corresponded to a 226.7% and 49.1% higher than those of DWc9n*. Secondly, the strain W3 was obtained by overexpressing leucyl-tRNA synthase LeuS in W2, which lead to a 190% improvement compared to DWc9n*, pulcherriminic acid yield increase to 367.7 mg/L. Thirdly, overexpression of the cytochrome synthase gene cluster yvmC-cypX further increased the yield of pulcherriminic acid to 507.4 mg/L. Finally, the secretion capability was improved by overexpressing the pulcherriminic acid transporter gene yvmA. This resulted in the 556.1 mg/L pulcherriminic acid was produced in W4/pHY-yvmA, increased by 340% as compared with DWc9n*, and it is the highest pulcherriminic acid production currently reported. Taken together, this study provided an efficient strategy for enhancing pulcherriminic acid production and might also be applied for high-level production of other cyclodipeptides.\\n\\nImportancePulcherriminic acid is a cyclodipeptide that derived from cyclo(L-Leu-L-Leu), which has the same iron chelation group with hydroxamate siderophores. Pulcherriminic acid producing strains can inhibit the growths of various bacteria and plant pathogenic fungi. However, the expected pulcherriminic acid yield was not achieved. This study reports efficient microbial production of pulcherriminic acid in Bacillus licheniformis DWc9n* via multistep metabolic engineering strategies. The combination of these interventions resulted in the establishment of a pulcherriminic acid overproducing strain. In combination with bioprocess engineering efforts, pulcherriminic acid was produced at a final yield of 556 mg/L in a shake flask. This is the highest pulcherriminic acid yield ever reported so far using rationally engineered microbial cell factories.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to anxiety- or fear-invoking stimuli initiates a convergence of executive actions orchestrated by multiple proteins and neurotransmitters across the brain. Dozens of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been linked to regulation of fear and anxiety. GPCR signaling involves canonical G protein pathways but may also engage downstream kinases and effectors through {beta}-arrestin scaffolds. Here, we investigate whether {beta}-arrestin signaling can regulate anxiety-like and fear-related behavior. Using the {delta}-opioid receptor ({delta}OR) as a model GPCR, we found that {beta}-arrestin 2-dependent activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) in the dorsal hippocampus and the amygdala are critical for {delta}OR agonist-induced anxiolytic-like effects. In contrast, G protein-mediated {delta}OR signaling was associated with decreased ERK1/2 activity and increased fear-related behavior. Our results also indicate unique contributions for {beta}-arrestin isoforms in modulation of anxiety-like and fear-related behavior. Overall, our findings highlight the significance of non-canonical {beta}-arrestin signaling in the regulation of emotions.\n\nOne sentence summaryUsing pharmacological and genetic strategies, we reveal the importance of non-canonical {beta}-arrestin-mediated G protein-coupled receptor signaling in anxiety-like behaviors.",

Cargo-free porous polymer scaffolds implanted in tumor-bearing mice act as synthetic metastatic niches recruiting metastasizing cancer cells. Herein, we investigated the mechanisms by which these implants attract cancer cells from circulation. Scaffolds attract cancer cells in part via S100A8/A9 secreted by Gr1+ myeloid cells in a mechanism that mimics lung metastasis. Further, cancer cells attracted to the scaffold have a lung-tropic gene expression signature regardless of their tissue of origin. The scaffold implant reduces metastasis to the lung suggesting otherwise lung-tropic cancer cells are diverted to the scaffold. The suppression of metastatic spread by the scaffold suggests this mechanism may be exploited for novel therapies, and may broadly influence the design of scaffold-based drug delivery system for anti-cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "The RNA export factor Mex67 is essential for the transport of mRNA through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) in yeast, but the molecular mechanism of this export process remains poorly understood. Here, we use quantitative fluorescence micro-scopy techniques in live budding yeast cells to investigate how Mex67 facilitates mRNA export. We show that Mex67 exhibits little interaction with mRNA in the nucleus and localizes to the NPC independently of mRNA, occupying a set of binding sites offered by FG repeats in the NPC. The ATPase Dbp5, which is thought to remove Mex67 from transcripts, does not affect the interaction of Mex67 with the NPC. Strikingly, we find that the essential function of Mex67 is spatially restricted to the NPC since a fusion of Mex67 to the nucleoporin Nup116 rescues a deletion of MEX67. Thus, Mex67 functions as a mobile nuclear pore component, which receives mRNA export substrates in the central channel of the NPC to facilitate their translocation to the cytoplasm.",

We applied m6A-SEAL to profile m6A landscapes in human and plant, which had good overlaps with antibody-based results and displayed the known m6A distribution features in transcriptome. Comparison with all available m6A sequencing methods and specific m6A sites validation by SELECT, we demonstrated that m6A-SEAL has good sensitivity, specificity, and reliability for transcriptome-wide detection of m6A.

The DOT1L inhibitor pinometostat (EPZ5676) was well tolerated in early phase clinical trials and showed modest clinical activity, including occasional complete responses (CRs) as single agent. These studies support the development of combinatorial therapies for KMT2A-rearranged leukemias. Here, we investigated two novel combinations: dual inhibition of the histone methyltransferases DOT1L and EZH2, and the combination of a DOT1L inhibitor with the protein synthesis inhibitor homoharringtonine (HHR).\\n\\nEZH2 is the catalytic histone methyltransferase in the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), and inhibition of EZH2 has reported preclinical activity in KMT2A-rearranged leukemia. We found that the H3K79 and H3K27 methyl marks are not dependent on each other, and that DOT1L and EZH2 inhibition affect largely distinct gene expression programs. In particular, the KMT2A/DOT1L target HOXA9, which is commonly de-repressed as a consequence of PRC2 loss or inhibition in other contexts, was not re-activated upon dual DOT1L/EZH2 knockout or inhibition. Despite encouraging data in murine KMT2A-MLLT3 transformed cells suggesting synergy between DOT1L and EZH2 inhibition, we found both synergistic and antagonistic effects on a panel of human KMT2A rearranged cell lines. Combinatorial inhibition of DOT1L and EZH2 is thus not a promising strategy. We identified opposing effects on ribosomal gene transcription and protein translation by DOT1L and EZH2 as a mechanism that is partially responsible for observed antagonistic effects. The effects of DOT1L inhibition on ribosomal gene expression prompted us to evaluate the combination of EPZ5676 with a protein translation inhibitor. EPZ5676 was synergistic with the protein translation inhibitor homoharringtonine (HHR), supporting further preclinical/clinical development of this combination.",

Id1 controls the balance between resting and proliferating states of RGCs by promoting quiescence. Here, we identified a phylogenetically conserved cis-regulatory module (CRM) mediating the specific expression of id1 in RGCs. Systematic deletion mapping and mutation of conserved transcription factor binding sites in stable transgenic zebrafish lines reveal that this CRM operates via conserved smad1/5 and 4 binding motifs (SBMs) under both homeostatic and regenerative conditions. Transcriptome analysis of injured and uninjured telencephala as well as pharmacological inhibition experiments identify a crucial role of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling for the function of the CRM.

Following treatment with L19-mIL12 or F8-mTNF, two antibody fusion proteins which preferentially concentrate a murine cytokine payload at the tumor site, CT26 tumors could be cured in a process that crucially relies on CD8+ T cells. In both settings, the AH1 peptide (derived from the gp70 envelop protein of murine leukemia virus) acted as the main tumor rejection antigen and ~50% of CD8+ T cells in the tumor mass are AH1-specific after therapy. In order to characterize the clonality of the T cell response after successful antibody-cytokine immunotherapy, we isolated CD8+ T cells from tumors and submitted them to T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing. As expected, different TCR sequences were found in different mice, as these molecules originate from a stochastic rearrangement process. CD8+ T cells featuring the ten most abundant TCR sequences represented more than 60% of total CD8+ T cell clones in the tumor mass, but less than 10% in the spleen. Looking at sorted CD8+ T cells from individual animals, AH1-specific TCRs were consistently found among the most abundant sequences. Collectively, these data suggest that the antitumor response driven by two different antibody-cytokine fusions proceeds through an oligoclonal expansion and activation of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells.",

    "abstract": "Eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against the four dengue virus serotypes (DENV1-4) that are spreading into new territories is an important goal of vaccine design. To delineate bNAb targets, we characterized 28 monoclonal antibodies belonging to expanded and hypermutated clonal families identified by transcriptomic analysis of single plasmablasts from DENV-infected individuals. Among these, we identified two somatically related bNAbs that potently neutralized DENV1-4. Mutagenesis studies revealed that the major recognition determinants of these bNAbs are in E protein domain I, distinct from the only known class of human bNAbs against flaviviruses with a well-defined epitope. B cell repertoire analysis from acute-phase peripheral blood suggested a memory origin and divergent somatic hypermutation pathways for these bNAbs, and a limited number of mutations was sufficient for neutralizing activity. Our study suggests multiple B cell evolutionary pathways leading to DENV bNAbs targeting a novel epitope that can be exploited for vaccine design.",

Utilising specific qPCR assays, both Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis were detected in cattle faeces, boma soil, water and household dust. M. bovis was also found in goat faeces and goat boma soil. This is the first report of faecal shedding of M. bovis in goats and the first molecular survey of faecal shedding in cattle. The prevalence of both bacterial species varied by village, area, season and sample type. Geographical and temporal correlations across sample types were suggestive of cross species transmission.

    "abstract": "Dravet syndrome (Dravet) epilepsy begins with febrile seizures followed by worsening to refractory seizures, with some improvement and stabilization toward adolescence. The neuronal basis of Dravet is debatable, with evidence favoring reduced inhibition or enhanced excitation. Focusing on the firing properties of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons and oriens-lacunosum moleculare (O-LM) interneurons, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the activity of both cell types through the febrile, worsening and stabilization stages. Our data indicate a temporary increase in the excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons during the febrile stage, which is fully reversed by the onset of spontaneous seizures. In contrast, reduced function of O-LM interneurons persisted from the febrile through the stabilization stages, with the greatest impairment of excitability occurring during the worsening stage. Thus, both excitatory and inhibitory neurons contribute to Dravet, indicating complex and reciprocal pathophysiological neuronal changes during the different stages of the disease.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=90 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/790170v2_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (15K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@220862org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@54840eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a9d006org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9854ec_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "A common reptile conservation strategy involves artificial incubation of embryos and release of hatchlings or juveniles into wild populations. Temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) occurs in most chelonians, permitting conservation managers to bias sex ratios towards females by incubating embryos at high temperatures, ultimately allowing the introduction of more egg-bearing individuals into populations. Here, we revisit classic sex allocation theory and hypothesize that TSD evolved in some reptile groups (specifically, chelonians and crocodilians) because male fitness is more sensitive to condition (general health, vigor) than female fitness. It follows that males benefit more than females from incubation environments that confer high-quality phenotypes, and hence high-condition individuals. We predict that female-producing temperatures, which comprise relatively high incubation temperatures in chelonians and crocodilians, are relatively stressful for embryos and subsequent life stages. We synthesize data from 28 studies to investigate how constant temperature incubation affects embryonic mortality in chelonians with TSD. We find several lines of evidence suggesting that female-producing temperatures, especially relatively warm temperatures, are more stressful than male-producing temperatures, and we find some evidence that pivotal temperatures (TPiv, the temperature that produces a 1:1 sex ratio) exhibit a correlated evolution with embryonic thermal tolerance. If patterns of temperature-sensitive embryonic mortality are also indicative of chronic thermal stress that occurs post hatching, then conservation programs may benefit from incubating eggs close to species-specific TPivs, thus avoiding high-temperature incubation. Indeed, our models predict that, on average, a sex ratio of more than 75% females can generally be achieved by incubating eggs only 1{degrees}C above TPiv. Of equal importance, we provide insight into the enigmatic evolution of TSD in chelonians, by providing support to the hypothesis that TSD evolution is related to the quality of the phenotype conferred by incubation temperature, with males produced in high-quality incubation environments.\n\nLay summaryWe analyze data on embryonic mortality under constant-temperature incubation for 15 species of chelonians with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). Mortality is lowest near species-specific pivotal temperatures (Tpiv) but increases rapidly above TPiv, consistent with a theory that explains the adaptive significance of TSD. Conservation managers should incubate embryos near TPiv.",

ADHD comorbid with DBDs (ADHD+DBDs) is a complex phenotype with a risk component that can be attributed to common genetic variants. Here we report a large GWAS meta-analysis of ADHD+DBDs based on seven cohorts in total including 3,802 cases and 31,305 controls. Three genome-wide significant loci were identified on chromosomes 1, 7, and 11. A GWAS meta-analysis including a Chinese cohort supported the locus on chromosome 11 to be a strong risk locus for ADHD+DBDs across European and Chinese ancestries (rs7118422, P=3.15x10-10, OR=1.17). This locus was not associated with ADHD without DBDs in a secondary GWAS of 13,583 ADHD cases and 22,314 controls, suggesting that the locus is a specific risk locus for the comorbid phenotype.\\n\\nWe found a higher SNP heritability for ADHD+DBDs (h2SNP =0.34) when compared to ADHD without DBDs (h2SNP =0.20). Genetic correlations of ADHD+DBDs with aggressive (rg =0.81) and anti-social behaviors (rg=0.82) were high, and polygenic risk score analyses revealed a significant increased burden of variants associated with ADHD and aggression in individuals with ADHD+DBDs compared to ADHD without DBDs. Our results suggests that ADHD+DBDs represent a more severe phenotype with respect to the genetic risk load than ADHD without DBDs, in line with previous studies, and that the risk load to some extent can be explained by variants associated with aggressive behavior.",

    "abstract": "ROR{gamma}t-expressing Tregs form a specialized subset of intestinal CD4+ Foxp3+ cells which is essential to maintain gut homeostasis and tolerance to commensal microbiota. Recently, c-Maf emerged as a critical factor in the regulation of ROR{gamma}t expression in Tregs. However, aside from c-Maf signaling, the signaling pathways involved in the differentiation of ROR{gamma}t+ Tregs and their possible interplay with c-Maf in this process are largely unknown. We show that ROR{gamma}t+ Treg development is controlled by positive as well as negative signals. Along with c-Maf signaling, signals derived from a complex microbiota, as well as IL-6/STAT3- and TGF-{beta}-derived signals act in favor of ROR{gamma}t+ Treg development. Ectopic expression of c-Maf did not rescue ROR{gamma}t expression in STAT3-deficient Tregs, indicating the presence of additional effectors downstream of STAT3. Moreover, we show that an inflammatory IFN-{gamma}/STAT1 signaling pathway acts as a negative regulator of ROR{gamma}t+ Treg differentiation in a c-Maf independent fashion.\\n\\nThese data thus argue for a complex integrative signaling network that finely tunes ROR{gamma}t expression in Tregs. The finding that type 1 inflammation impedes ROR{gamma}t+ Treg development even in the presence of an active IL-6/STAT3 pathway further suggests a dominant negative effect of STAT1 over STAT3 in this process.",

    "abstract": "Redox signalling is an important modulator of diverse biological pathways and processes, and operates through specific post-translational modification of redox-sensitive thiols on cysteine residues 1-4. Critically, redox signalling is distinct from irreversible oxidative damage and functions as a reversible  redox switch to regulate target proteins. H2O2 acts as the major effector of redox signalling, both directly and through intracellular thiol redox relays 5,6. Dysregulation of redox homeostasis has long been implicated in the pathophysiology of many age-related diseases, as well as in the ageing process itself, however the underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear 7,8. To study redox signalling by H2O2 in vivo and explore its involvement in metabolic health and longevity, we used the fruit fly Drosophila as a model organism, with its tractable lifespan and strong evolutionary conservation with mammals 9. Here we report that inducing an endogenous redox-shift, by manipulating levels of the H2O2-degrading enzyme catalase, improves health and robustly extends lifespan in flies, independently of oxidative stress resistance and dietary restriction. We find that the catalase redox-shifted flies are acutely sensitive to starvation stress, which relies on autophagy as a vital survival mechanism. Importantly, we show that autophagy is essential for the lifespan extension of the catalase flies. Furthermore, using redox-inactive knock-in mutants of Atg4a, a major effector of autophagy, we show that the lifespan extension in response to catalase requires a key redox-regulatory cysteine residue, Cys102 in Atg4a. These findings demonstrate that redox regulation of autophagy can extend lifespan, confirming the importance of redox signalling in ageing and as a potential pro-longevity target.",

    "abstract": "Human aging is characterized by impaired spatial cognition and reductions in the distinctiveness of category-specific fMRI activation patterns. Yet, little is know about age-related decline in neural distinctiveness of spatial information. Here, we asked whether neural tuning functions of walking direction are broadened in older versus younger adults. To test this idea, we developed a novel method that allowed us to investigate changes in fMRI-measured pattern similarity while participants navigated in different directions in a virtual spatial navigation task. We expected that directional tuning functions would be broader in older adults, and thus activation patterns that reflect neighboring directions would be less distinct as compared to non-adjacent directions. Because loss of distinctiveness leads to more confusions when information is read out by downstream areas, we analyzed predictions of a decoder trained on these representations and asked (1) whether decoder confusions between two directions increase proportionally to their angular similarity, (2) and how this effect may differ between age groups. Evidence for tuning-function-like signals was found in the retrosplenial complex and primary visual cortex. Significant age differences in tuning width, however, were only found in the primary visual cortex, suggesting that less precise visual information could lead to worse directional signals in older adults. Yet, age differences in visual tuning were not related to behavior. Instead, directional information encoded in RSC correlated with memory on task. These results shed new light on neural mechanisms underling age-related spatial navigation impairments and introduce a novel approach to measure tuning specificity using fMRI.",

    "abstract": "Human KCNH2 (hKCNH2, Ether-a-go-go (EAG)-Related Gene, hERG) are best known for their role in cardiac action potentials repolarization and have key roles in various pathologies. As other KCNH family members, hKCNH2 contains a unique intracellular complex crucial for channel function, consisting of an N-terminal eag domain and a C-terminal cyclic nucleotide-binding homology domain (CNBHD). Previous studies demonstrated that the CNBHD is occupied by an intrinsic ligand motif (ILM), in a self-liganded conformation, providing a structural mechanism for the lack of KCNH channels regulation by cyclic nucleotides. While significant advancements in structural and functional characterizations of the CNBHD of KCNH channels have been made, a high-resolution structure of the hKCNH2 intracellular complex was missing. Here, we report the 1.5 [A] resolution structure of the hKCNH2 channel CNBHD. The structure reveals the canonical fold shared by other KCNH family members, where the spatial organization of the ILM is preserved within the {beta}-roll region. Moreover, measurements of small-angle X-ray scattering profile in solution, as well as comparison with a recent nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis of hKCNH2, revealed high agreement with the structure, indicating an overall low flexibility in solution. Importantly, we identified a novel salt-bridge (E807-R863), which was not previously resolved in the NMR and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures. Strikingly, electrophysiological analysis of charge reversal mutations revealed its crucial role for hKCNH2 function. Moreover, comparison with other KCNH members revealed the structural conservation of this salt-bridge, consistent with its functional significance. Together with the available structure of the mouse KCNH1 intracellular complex, and previous electrophysiological and spectroscopic studies of KCNH family members, we propose that this salt-bridge serves as a strategically positioned linchpin to support both the spatial organization of the ILM and the maintenance of the intracellular complex interface.\\n\\nSummaryHuman KCNH2 are key channels governing cardiac repolarization. Here, a 1.5 [A] resolution structure of their cyclic nucleotide-binding homology domain is presented. Structural analysis and electrophysiological validation reveal a novel salt-bridge, playing an important role in hKCNH2 functional regulation.",

We show that parS-ParB associate to form nanometer-sized, round condensates. ParB molecules diffuse rapidly within the nucleoid volume, but display confined motions when trapped inside ParB condensates. Single ParB molecules are able to rapidly diffuse between different condensates, and nucleation is strongly favoured by parS. Notably, the ParA motor is required to prevent the fusion of ParB condensates. These results describe a novel active mechanism that splits, segregates and localises non-canonical LLPS condensates in the sub-cellular space.",

We hypothesized that developmental Pb exposure would lead to persistent changes in DNA methylation, and that a subset of differentially methylated loci would overlap between liver and blood.\\n\\nMethodsEnhanced reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing was used to assess DNA methylation in 5 month old Pb-exposed and control mice. Sex-stratified modeling of differential methylation by Pb exposure was conducted using an established bioinformatics pipeline.\\n\\nResultsAlthough Pb exposure ceased at 3 weeks of age, we observed thousands of stably modified, sex-specific differentially methylated regions in the blood and liver of Pb-exposed animals, including 44 genomically imprinted loci. In males, we discovered 5 sites that overlapped between blood and liver, and exhibited changes in DNA methylation in the same direction in both tissues.\\n\\nConclusionsThese data demonstrate that perinatal exposure to Pb induces sex-specific changes in hepatic DNA methylation in adulthood, some of which are also present in blood. Ongoing studies will provide additional exposure-specific insights, and include other epigenetic marks that will enable further refinement of the design and analysis of human studies where target tissues are inaccessible.",

    "abstract": "RationaleIn a previous study investigating choice between heroin and a non-drug alternative in animals, reductions in income (i.e., choices/day) caused the percentage of income spent on heroin to progressively decrease. In contrast, another study found that humans with opioid use disorder spent the majority of their income on heroin even though they had little income. Comparison of these two studies suggests that the seemingly conflicting results could be explained by differences in the underlying economy types of the choice alternatives.\\n\\nObjectiveThe present experiment tested the hypothesis that the effect of income changes on choice between heroin and a non-drug alternative depends on economy type.\\n\\nMethodsRats chose between heroin and saccharin under three income levels. For the Closed group, the choice session was the only opportunity to obtain these reinforcers. For the Heroin Open group and the Saccharin Open group, choice sessions were followed by 3-h periods of unlimited access to heroin or saccharin, respectively.\\n\\nResultsAs income decreased, the Closed and Heroin Open groups, but not the Saccharin Open group, spent an increasingly greater percentage of income on saccharin than on heroin. The Saccharin Open group, compared to the other groups, spent a greater percentage of income on heroin as income decreased.\\n\\nConclusionsResults confirm that the effects of income and economy type can interact and this may explain the apparently discrepant results of earlier studies. More generally, findings suggest that situations where heroin choice has little consequence for consumption of non-drug alternatives may promote heroin use.",

    "abstract": "In the past decade, a large number of genetic biomarkers have been discovered through large-scale genome wide association studies (GWASs) in Alzheimers disease (AD), such as APOE, TOMM40 and CLU. Despite this significant progress, existing genetic findings are largely passengers not directly involved in the driver events, which presents challenges for replication and translation into targetable mechanisms. In this paper, leveraging the protein interaction network, we proposed a modularity-constrained Lasso model to jointly analyze the genotype, gene expression and protein expression data. With a prior network capturing the functional relationship between SNPs, genes and proteins, the newly introduced penalty term maximizes the global modularity of the subnetwork involving selected markers and encourages the selection of multi-omic markers with dense functional connectivity, instead of individual markers. We applied this new model to the real data in ROS/MAP cohort for discovery of biomarkers related to cognitive performance. A functionally connected subnetwork involving 276 multi-omic biomarkers, including SNPs, genes and proteins, were identified to bear predictive power. Within this subnetwork, multiple trans-omic paths from SNPs to genes and then proteins were observed, suggesting that cognitive performance can be potentially affected by the genetic mutations due to their cascade effect on the expression of downstream genes and proteins.",

This approach has several advantages over existing systems: it eliminates contaminating background signal from input virus or plasmid DNA and can be easily adapted to multiple genotypes and mutants. Further, it can be applied to identify anti-HBV compounds, measure anti-HBV drug efficiency, study virus evolution, and, as we demonstrate, it can be uniquely applied to predict antiviral drug resistance.",

    "abstract": "The main type of zonal conservation approach corresponds to Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), which are spatially defined and generally static entities aiming at the protection of some target populations by the implementation of a management plan. For highly mobile species the relevance of an MPA over time might be hampered by temporal variations in distributions or home ranges. In the present work, we used habitat model-based predicted distributions of cetaceans and seabirds within the Bay of Biscay from 2004 to 2017 to characterise the aggregation and persistence of mobile species distributional patterns and the relevance of the existing MPA network. We explored the relationship between population abundance and spatial extent of distribution to assess the aggregation level of species distribution. We used the smallest spatial extent including 75% of the population present in the Bay of Biscay to define specific core areas of distributions, and calculated their persistence over the 14 studied years. We inspected the relevance of the MPA network with respect to aggregation and persistence. We found that aggregation and persistence are two independent features of marine megafauna distributions. Indeed, strong persistence was shown in both aggregated (bottlenose dolphins, auks) and loosely distributed species (northern gannets), while some species with aggregated distributions also showed limited year-to-year persistence in their patterns (black-legged kittiwakes). We thus have demonstrated that both aggregation and persistence have potential impact on the amount of spatio-temporal distributional variability encompassed within static MPAs. Our results exemplified the need to have access to a minimal temporal depth in the species distribution data when aiming to designate new site boundaries for the conservation of mobile species.",

The standard methodology to analyze AER data applies disproportionality metrics, which estimate the strength of drug/side-effect associations from discrete counts of their occurrence at report level. However, in other domains, improvements in predictive modeling accuracy have been obtained through representation learning, where discrete features are replaced by distributed representations learned from unlabeled data. This paper describes aer2vec, a novel representational approach for AER data in which concept embeddings emerge from neural networks trained to predict drug/side-effect co-occurrence. Trained models are evaluated for their utility in identifying drug/side-effect relationships, with improvements over disproportionality metrics in most cases. In addition, we evaluate the utility of an otherwise-untapped resource in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) AER system - reporter designations of suspected causality - and find that incorporating this information enhances performance of all models evaluated.",

Here we report that certain representative heteroloboseans, jakobids, malawimonads and hemimastigotes unexpectedly possess homologues of core T2SS components. We show that at least some of them are present in mitochondria, and their behaviour in biochemical assays is consistent with the presence of a mitochondrial T2SS-derived system (miT2SS). We additionally identified 23 protein families co-occurring with miT2SS in eukaryotes. Seven of these proteins could be directly linked to the core miT2SS by functional data and/or sequence features, whereas others may represent different parts of a broader functional pathway, possibly also involving the peroxisome. Its distribution in eukaryotes and phylogenetic evidence together indicate that the miT2SS-centred pathway is an ancestral eukaryotic trait. Our findings thus have direct implications for the functional properties of the early mitochondrion.",

    "abstract": "Age-related neural changes may compromise older adults decision-making, increasing their risk of fraud and financial abuse. One manifestation of nonrational influences on decision-making is susceptibility to \\\"framing effects,\\\" in which decisions are biased by irrelevant contextual features of how choice information is presented. We investigated whether polymorphisms in genes related to dopamine neurotransmission (COMT) and neurodegeneration (ApoE) influence the susceptibility of older adults to framing effects. We administered an online test of susceptibility to framing effects to a cohort of 113 healthy older adults who had undergone genetic testing for COMT and ApoE genotype. The task required the participant to choose a risky or safe option in pairs of situations that were monetarily equivalent but differed in whether the choice was framed in terms of gains or losses. A general linear model was used to test for associations between inconsistency in choice across the set of choice pairs and these genotypes, controlling for age, education, gender and traditional measures of executive function. While no association to framing effects was found for ApoE, the Valine allele of COMT Val158Met was significantly associated with greater susceptibility to framing, although the association was no longer significant after adjustment for demographic covariates. Our results suggest that greater frontal dopamine concentrations associated with the COMT Met allele are protective against less consistent decision making in older adults. When compared to previous findings in young adults, our findings provide additional support for an inverted-U shaped model of prefrontal dopamine function.",

    "abstract": "Recent trends in cannabis legalization have increased the necessity to better understand the effects of cannabis use. Animal models involving traditional cannabinoid self-administration approaches have been notoriously difficult to establish and differences in the drug employed and its route of administration have limited the translational value of preclinical studies. To address this challenge in the field, we have developed a novel method of cannabis self-administration using response-contingent delivery of vaporized {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol-rich (CANTHC) or cannabidiol-rich (CANCBD) complete cannabis extracts. Male Sprague Dawley rats were trained to nosepoke for discrete puffs of CANTHC, CANCBD, or vehicle (VEH) in daily one-hour sessions. Cannabis vapor reinforcement resulted in strong discrimination between active and inactive operanda. CANTHC maintained higher response rates under fixed ratio schedules and higher break points under progressive ratio schedules compared to CANCBD or VEH, and the number of vapor deliveries positively correlated with plasma THC concentrations. Moreover, metabolic phenotyping studies revealed alterations in locomotor activity, energy expenditure, and daily food intake that are consistent with effects in human cannabis users. Furthermore, both cannabis regimens produced ecologically relevant brain concentrations of THC and CBD and CANTHC administration decreased hippocampal CB1 receptor binding. Removal of CANTHC reinforcement (but not CANCBD) resulted in a robust extinction burst and an increase in cue-induced cannabis-seeking behavior relative to VEH. These data indicate that volitional exposure to THC-rich cannabis vapor has bona fide reinforcing properties and collectively support the utility of the vapor self-administration model for the preclinical assessment of volitional cannabis intake and cannabis-seeking behaviors.",

Large-scale reorganization of brain activity accompanying learning occurred in a mixed frontoparietal and default mode network. Sex differences were observed in frontoparietal, default mode, and primary visual areas before and after instruction.

    "abstract": "ObjectiveGastrointestinal hormones contribute to the beneficial effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) on glycemic control. Secretin is secreted from duodenal S-cells in response to low luminal pH, but it is unknown whether its secretion is altered after RYGB and if secretin contributes to the post-operative improvement in glycemic control. We hypothesized that secretin secretion increases after RYGB as a result of the diversion of nutrients to more distal parts of the small intestine, and thereby affects islet hormone release.\\n\\nMethodsA specific secretin radioimmunoassay was developed, evaluated biochemically, and used to quantify plasma concentrations of secretin in 13 obese individuals before, 1 week after and 3 months after RYGB. Distribution of secretin and its receptor was assessed by RNA-sequencing, mass-spectrometry and in situ hybridization in human and rat tissues. Isolated, perfused rat intestine and pancreas were used to explore the molecular mechanism underlying glucose-induced secretin secretion and to study direct effects of secretin on glucagon, insulin and somatostatin secretion. Secretin was administered alone or in combination with GLP-1 to non-sedated rats to evaluate effects on glucose regulation.\\n\\nResultsPlasma postprandial secretin was more than doubled in humans after RYGB (P<0.001). The distal small intestine harbored secretin expressing cells in both rats and humans. Glucose increased secretion of secretin in a sodium-glucose co-transporter dependent manner when administered to the distal part but not into the proximal part of the rat small intestine. Secretin stimulated somatostatin secretion (fold change: 1.59, P<0.05) from the perfused rat pancreas but affected neither insulin (P=0.2) nor glucagon (P=0.97) secretion. When administered to rats in vivo, insulin secretion was attenuated and glucagon secretion increased (P=0.04), while blood glucose peak time was delayed (from 15 min to 45 min) and gastric emptying time prolonged (P=0.004).\\n\\nConclusionGlucose-sensing secretin cells located in the distal part of the small intestine may contribute to increased plasma concentrations observed after RYGB. The metabolic role of the distal S-cells warrants further studies.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutic activation of thermogenic brown adipose tissue (BAT) may be feasible to prevent, or treat, cardiometabolic disease. However, rodents are commonly housed below thermoneutrality ([~]20{degrees}C) which can modulate their metabolism and physiology including the hyperactivation of brown (BAT) and beige white adipose tissue. We housed animals at thermoneutrality from weaning to chronically supress BAT, mimic human physiology and explore the efficacy of chronic, mild cold-exposure and {beta}3-adrenoreceptor agonism under these conditions. Using metabolic phenotyping and exploratory proteomics we show that transfer from 28{degrees}C to 20{degrees}C drives weight gain and a 125% increase in subcutaneous fat mass, an effect not seen with YM-178 administration thus suggesting a direct effect of a cool ambient temperature in promoting weight gain and further adiposity in obese rats. Following chronic suppression of BAT, uncoupling protein 1 mRNA was undetectable in IWAT in all groups. Using exploratory adipose tissue proteomics, we reveal novel gene ontology terms associated with cold-induced weight gain in BAT and IWAT whilst Reactome pathway analysis highlights the regulation of mitotic (i.e. G2/M transition) and metabolism of amino acids and derivatives pathways. Conversely, YM-178 had minimal metabolic-related effects but modified pathways involved in proteolysis (i.e. eukaryotic translation initiation) and RNA surveillance across both tissues. Taken together these findings are indicative of a novel mechanism whereby animals increase body weight and fat mass following chronic suppression of adaptive thermogenesis from weaning. In addition, treatment with a B3-adrenoreceptor agonist did not improve metabolic health in obese animals raised at thermoneutrality.",

    "abstract": "AimsCommon chromosome 9p21 SNPs increase coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, independent of \\\"traditional lipid risk factors\\\". However, lipids comprise large numbers of structurally-related molecules not measured in traditional risk measurements, and many have inflammatory bioactivities. Here we applied lipidomic and genomic approaches to three model systems, to characterize lipid metabolic changes in common Chr9p21 SNPs which confer [~]30% elevated CHD risk associated with altered expression of ANRIL, a long ncRNA.\\n\\nMethods and ResultsUntargeted and targeted lipidomics was applied to plasma samples from Northwick Park Heart Study II (NPHSII) homozygotes for AA or GG in rs10757274. Elevated risk GG correlated with reduced lysophosphospholipids (lysoPLs), lysophosphatidic acids (lysoPA) and autotaxin (ATX). Five other risk SNPs did not show this phenotype. Correlation and network analysis showed that lysoPL-lysoPA interconversion was uncoupled from ATX in GG, indicating metabolic dysregulation. To identify candidate genes, transcriptomic data from shRNA downregulation of ANRIL in HEK293 cells was mined. Significantly-altered expression of several lysoPL/lysoPA metabolising enzymes was found (MBOAT2, PLA2G4C, LPCAT2, ACSL6, PNPLA2, PLBD1, PLPP1, PLPP2 and PLPPR2). Next, vascular smooth muscle cells differentiated from iPSCs of individuals homozygous for Chr9p21 risk SNPs were examined. Here, the presence of risk alleles was associated with altered expression of several lysoPL/lysoPA enzymes. Importantly, for several, deletion of the risk locus fully or partially reversed their expression to non-risk haplotype levels: ACSL3, DGKA, PLA2G2A, LPCAT2, LPL, PLA2G3, PNPLA3, PLA2G12A LIPC, LCAT, PLA2G6, ACSL1, MBOAT2.\\n\\nConclusionA Chr9p21 risk SNP associates with complex alterations in immune-bioactive phospholipids and their enzymatic metabolism.

    "abstract": "People with superior face recognition have relatively thin cortex in face-selective brain areas, while those with superior vehicle recognition have relatively thick cortex in the same areas. We suggest that these opposite correlations reflect distinct mechanisms influencing cortical thickness (CT) for abilities acquired at different points in development. We explore a new prediction regarding the specificity of these effects through the depth of the cortex: that face recognition selectively and negatively correlates with thickness of the deepest laminar subdivision in face-selective areas. With ultra-high resolution MRI at 7T, we estimated the thickness of three laminar subdivisions, which we term MR layers, in the right fusiform face area (rFFA) in 14 adult male humans. Face recognition was negatively associated with the thickness of deep MR layers, while vehicle recognition was positively related to the thickness of all layers. Regression model comparisons provided overwhelming support for a model specifying that the magnitude of the association between face recognition and CT differs across MR layers (deep vs. superficial/middle) while the magnitude of the association between vehicle recognition and CT is invariant across layers. The total CT of rFFA accounted for 69% of the variance in face recognition, and thickness of the deep layer alone accounted for 84% of this variance. Our findings demonstrate the functional validity of MR laminar estimates in FFA. Studying the structural basis of individual differences for multiple abilities in the same cortical area can reveal effects of distinct mechanisms that are not apparent when studying average variation or development.\\n\\nSignificance StatementFace and object recognition vary in the normal population and are only modestly related to each other. The recognition of faces and vehicles are both positively related to neural responses in the fusiform face area (FFA), but show different relations to the cortical thickness of FFA. Here, we use very high-resolution MRI, and find that face recognition ability (a skill acquired early in life) is negatively correlated with thickness of FFAs deepest MR-defined layers, whereas recognition of vehicles (a skill acquired later in life) is positively related to thickness at of all cortical layers. Our methods can be used in the future to characterize sources of variability in human abilities and relate them to distinct mechanisms of neural plasticity.",

In 2015, Himmelstein identified the mean time from manuscript submission to acceptance in biomedicine as approximately 100 days.

A previous study, in biomedicine, leveraged publicly available data to identify a 100-day waiting period between manuscript submission and acceptance. However, this study provides limited information on timelines for health professions education (HPE) articles. Thus, the current study replicates the original investigation with publication timeline data for eight HPE journals, which make their data publicly accessible, finding the mean time from submission to acceptance to be 181 days.

    "abstract": "The K* algorithm provably approximates partition functions for a set of states (e.g., protein, ligand, and protein-ligand complex) to a user-specified accuracy{varepsilon} . Often, reaching an{varepsilon} -approximation for a particular set of partition functions takes a prohibitive amount of time and space. To alleviate some of this cost, we introduce two algorithms into the osprey suite for protein design: O_SCPLOWFRIESC_SCPLOW, a Fast Removal of Inadequately Energied Sequences, and EWAK*, an Energy Window Approximation to K*. In combination, these algorithms provably retain calculational accuracy while limiting the input sequence space and the conformations included in each partition function calculation to only the most energetically favorable. This combined approach leads to significant speed-ups compared to the previous state-of-the-art multi-sequence algorithm, BBK*. As a proof of concept, we used these new algorithms to redesign the protein-protein interface (PPI) of the c-Raf-RBD:KRas complex. The Ras-binding domain of the protein kinase c-Raf (c-Raf-RBD) is the tightest known binder of KRas, a historically \\\"undruggable\\\" protein implicated in difficult-to-treat cancers including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). O_SCPLOWFRIESC_SCPLOW/EWAK* accurately retrospectively predicted the effect of 38 out of 41 different sets of mutations in the PPI of the c-Raf-RBD:KRas complex. Notably, these mutations include mutations whose effect had previously been incorrectly predicted using other computational methods. Next, we used O_SCPLOWFRIESC_SCPLOW/EWAK* for prospective design and discovered a novel point mutation that improves binding of c-Raf-RBD to KRas in its active, GTP-bound state (KRasGTP). We combined this new mutation with two previously reported mutations (which were also highly-ranked by O_SCPLOWOSPREYC_SCPLOW) to create a new variant of c-Raf-RBD, c-Raf-RBD(RKY). O_SCPLOWFRIESC_SCPLOW/EWAK* in O_SCPLOWOSPREYC_SCPLOW computationally predicted that this new variant would bind even more tightly than the previous best-binding variant, c-Raf-RBD(RK). We measured the binding affinity of c-Raf-RBD(RKY) using a bio-layer interferometry (BLI) assay and found that this new variant exhibits single-digit nanomolar affinity for KRasGTP, confirming the computational predictions made with O_SCPLOWFRIESC_SCPLOW/EWAK*. This study steps through the advancement and development of computational protein design by presenting theory, new algorithms, accurate retrospective designs, new prospective designs, and biochemical validation.\\n\\nAuthor summaryComputational structure-based protein design is an innovative tool for redesigning proteins to introduce a particular or novel function. One such possible function is improving the binding of one protein to another, which can increase our understanding of biomedically important protein systems toward the improvement or development of novel therapeutics. Herein we introduce two novel, provable algorithms, O_SCPLOWFRIESC_SCPLOW and EWAK*, for more efficient computational structure-based protein design as well as their application to the redesign of the c-Raf-RBD:KRas protein-protein interface. These new algorithms speed up computational structure-based protein design while maintaining accurate calculations, allowing for larger, previously infeasible protein designs. Using O_SCPLOWFRIESC_SCPLOW and EWAK* within the O_SCPLOWOSPREYC_SCPLOW suite, we designed the tightest known binder of KRas, an \\\"undruggable\\\" cancer target. This new variant of a KRas-binding domain, c-Raf-RBD, should serve as an important tool to probe the protein-protein interface between KRas and its effectors as work continues toward an effective therapeutic targeting KRas.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundKnowledge on the molecular targets of diseases and drugs is crucial for elucidating disease pathogenesis and mechanism of action of drugs, and for driving drug discovery and treatment formulation. In this regard, high-throughput gene transcriptional profiling has become a leading technology, generating whole-genome data on the transcriptional alterations caused by diseases or drug compounds. However, identifying direct gene targets, especially in the background of indirect (downstream) effects, based on differential gene expressions is difficult due to the complexity of gene regulatory network governing the gene transcriptional processes.\\n\\nResultsIn this work, we developed a network analysis method, called DeltaNeTS+, for inferring direct gene targets of drugs and diseases from gene transcriptional profiles. DeltaNeTS+ relies on a gene regulatory network model to identify direct perturbations to the transcription of genes. Importantly, DeltaNeTS+ is able to combine both steady-state and time-course gene expression profiles, as well as to leverage information on the gene network structure that is increasingly becoming available for a multitude of organisms, including human. We demonstrated the power of DeltaNeTS+ in predicting gene targets using gene expression data in complex organisms, including Caenorhabditis elegans and human cell lines (T-cell and Calu-3). More specifically, in an application to time-course gene expression profiles of influenza A H1N1 (swine flu) and H5N1 (avian flu) infection, DeltaNeTS+ shed light on the key differences of dynamic cellular perturbations caused by the two influenza strains.\\n\\nConclusionDeltaNeTS+ is an enabling tool to infer gene transcriptional perturbations caused by diseases and drugs from gene transcriptional profiles. By incorporating available information on gene network structure, DeltaNeTS+ produces accurate predictions of direct gene targets from a small sample size (~10s).

    "abstract": "Marked accumulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) with a particular pathogenic mutation is necessary for the mutant mtDNA to express its pathogenicity as mitochondrial respiration defects. However, the nuclear genome background, or the physiological status, or both, might also be important for the pathogenic regulation of mutant mtDNAs, because most mitochondrial function is controlled by polypeptides encoded in the nuclear genome. To test this, we generated diabetic mice carrying pathogenic mtDNA with a large-scale deletion ({Delta}mtDNA) that loses six tRNA genes and seven structural genes essential for mitochondrial respiration. Compared with non-diabetic mice carrying {Delta}mtDNA, diabetic mice carrying {Delta}mtDNA showed a decrease in mitochondrial biogenesis regulated by nuclear-encoded genes, and mitochondrial respiration defects and the resultant mitochondrial disease phenotypes were induced even in the case of low loads of {Delta}mtDNA. In addition, diabetic culture conditions intensified the pathogenicity of human mtDNA with an A3243G point mutation in the tRNALue (UUR) gene. Our results indicated that the diabetic conditions are a modifier that exacerbates mitochondrial respiration defects due to mutant mtDNAs. The finding suggests the possibility that recovery from diabetic conditions might be an effective treatment strategy for some disorders involving both mutant mtDNAs and diabetic signs.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryIt has been reported that accumulation of pathogenic mutant mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and the resultant mitochondrial metabolic dysfunction are associated with a wide variety of disorders, such as mitochondrial diseases, diabetes, neuo-degenerative disorders, and cancers. Considering that most mitochondrial function is regulated by nuclear-genome-encoded polypeptides, it is very important to focus on cooperation between mutant mtDNA, nuclear genetic background, and vital conditions for understanding precise pathogeneses of mtDNA-mediated disorders. By using model cells and mice carrying pathogenic mtDNAs, we report here that diabetic conditions are a modifier for the pathogenic regulation of mutant mtDNAs. Because the onset and progression of diabetes are often associated with aging, our finding suggests that some age-associated disorders with mutant mtDNAs and diabetic complications might be induced partly by enhancement of the pathogenicity of mutant mtDNAs by diabetic conditions.",

    "abstract": "It has been repeatedly reported that motivation for listening to music is majorly driven by the latters emotional effect. There is a relative opposition to this approach, however, suggesting that music does not elicit true emotions. Counteracting this notion, contemporary research studies indicate that listeners do respond affectively to music providing a scientific basis in differentially approaching and registering affective responses to music as of their behavioral or biological states. Nevertheless, no studies exist that combine the behavioral and neuroscientific research domains, offering a cross-referenced neuropsychological outcome, based on a non-personalized approach specifically using a continuous response methodology with ecologically valid musical stimuli for both research domains. Our study, trying to fill this void for the first time, discusses a relevant proof-of-concept protocol, and presents the technical outline on how to multimodally measure elicited responses on evoked emotional responses when listening to music. Specifically, we showcase how we measure the structural music elements as they vary from the beginning to the end within two different compositions, suggesting how and why to analyze and compare standardized, non-personalized behavioral to electroencephalographic data. Reporting our preliminary findings based on this protocol, we focus on the electroencephalographic data collected from n=13 participants in two separate studies (i.e., different equipment and sample background), cross-referencing and cross-validating the biological side of the protocols structure. Our findings suggest (a) that all participants - irrespectively of the study - reacted consistently in terms of hemispheric lateralization for each stimulus (i.e., uniform intra-subjective emotional reaction; non-statistically significant differentiation in individual variability) and (b) that diverse patterns of biological representations emerge for each stimulus between the subjects in the two studies (variable inter-subjective emotional reaction; statistically significant differentiation in group variability) pointing towards exogenous to the measurements process factors. We conclude discussing further steps and implications of our protocol approach.",

This is in agreement with the Late Triassic fossil record and may have contributed to the latitudinal gap in the Triassic prosauropod record.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Cisplatin is a highly successful chemotherapeutic agent used for the treatment of solid tumors. However, nephrotoxicity is a limiting factor that occurs in 30% of patients under treatment. Many mechanisms are involved in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, such as epithelial and endothelial injury, inflammation, oxidative stress, and renal vasoconstriction. The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) has an important role in inflammation and vascular function. MR blockage and ablation have been shown to be effective in preventing renal ischemia-reperfusion injury and cyclosporine A-induced nephrotoxicity. We investigated whether MR antagonism with spironolactone or eplerenone could prevent cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. Here, we show that spironolactone treatment exacerbates nephrotoxicity in mice treated with acute and long-term cisplatin regimes. Moreover, spironolactone potentiated the toxicity induced by cisplatin treatment in a cell viability assay in human embryonic kidney cells. In contrast, eplerenone neither prevented nor increased cisplatin toxicity in mice or cultured cells. Thus, our studies support recent findings showing that spironolactone potentiates cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity, independently of mineralocorticoid receptor inhibition.",

Hydrogen peroxide is also utilized as a read out in biosensors to quantitate lactate levels in biological samples. Aerococcus viridans lactate oxidase is the best characterized lactate oxidase and our knowledge of lactate oxidases relies largely to studies conducted with that particular enzyme. Pediococcus acidilactici lactate oxidase is also commercially available for e.g. lactate measurements, but this enzyme has not been characterized before in detail. Here we report structural characterization of the recombinant enzyme and its co-factor dependent oligomerization. The crystal structures revealed two distinct conformations in the loop closing the active site, consistent with previous biochemical studies implicating the role of loop in catalysis. Despite the structural conservation of active site residues when compared to Aerococcus viridans lactate oxidase we were not able to detect either oxidase or monooxygenase activity when L-lactate or other potential alpha hydroxyl acids were used as a substrate. Pediococcus acidilactici lactate oxidase is therefore an example of a misannotation of an FMN-dependent enzyme, which catalyzes likely a so far unknown oxidation reaction.",

We conducted this study to describe the dynamics of the acquisition of respiratory pathogens, their potential interactions and risk factors for possible lower respiratory tract infection symptoms (LRTI) among French pilgrims during the 2018 Hajj. Pilgrims from Marseille who were participating in the Hajj were recruited. Each participant underwent four successive systematic nasopharyngeal swabs before and during their stay in Saudi Arabia. Carriage of the main respiratory pathogens was assessed by PCR. 121 pilgrims were included and 93.4% reported respiratory symptoms during the study period. Polymicrobial carriage was observed in 73.8% samples. The acquisition of rhinovirus, coronaviruses and Staphylococcus aureus occurred soon after arrival in Saudi Arabia and rates decreased gradually after days 5 and 6. In contrast, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae carriage increased progressively until the end of the stay in Saudi Arabia. Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis carriage increased starting around days 12 and 13, following an initial clearance. Influenza viruses were rarely isolated. We observed an independent positive mutual association between S. aureus and rhinovirus carriage and between H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis carriage. Dual carriage of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis was strongly associated with S. pneumoniae carriage (OR = 6.22, 95%CI [2.04-19.01]). Finally, our model showed that M. catarrhalis carriage was negatively associated with K. pneumoniae carriage. Chronic respiratory disease was associated with symptoms of LRTI. K. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis-S. aureus and H. influenzae-rhinovirus dual carriage was associated with LRTI symptoms. Our data suggest that RTIs at the Hajj are a result of complex interactions between a number of respiratory viruses and bacteria.\\n\\nAuthor summaryDespite the recommendation to take individual preventive measures to prevent respiratory tract infections, these infections remain common among Hajj pilgrims. Respiratory pathogens acquired during the Hajj are usually studied individually, although in their natural environment they often compete or coexist with multiple microbial species. A better understanding of polymicrobial interactions in the nasopharynx among Hajj pilgrims is important. Our study describes the dynamics of the acquisition of respiratory pathogens and their potential interactions among pilgrims during the Hajj. We found that polymicrobial carriage was observed in most individuals and that some pathogens associated positively while other did not. Some pathogen associations correlated with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infections.",
