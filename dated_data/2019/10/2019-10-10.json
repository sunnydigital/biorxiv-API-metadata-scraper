    "abstract": "RNA G-quadruplexes (G4s) are non-canonical secondary structures that have been proposed to function as regulators of post-transcriptional mRNA localisation and translation. G4s within 3 UTRs of some neuronal mRNAs are known to control their distal localisation and local translation, contributing to the distinct local proteomes that facilitate the synaptic remodelling attributed to normal cellular function. In this study, we characterise the G4 formation of a (GGN)13 repeat found within the 5 UTR of KCNK9 mRNA, encoding the potassium 2-pore domain leak channel Task3. Using circular dichroism, we show that this (GGN)13 repeat forms a parallel G4 that exhibits the stereotypical potassium specificity of a G4, remaining thermostable under physiological ionic conditions. The G4 is inhibitory to translation of Task3, which can be overcome through the activity of the G4-specific helicase DHX36, consequently increasing K+ leak currents and decreasing resting membrane potentials in HEK293 cells. Additionally, we observe that this G4 is fundamental to ensuring the delivery of Task3 mRNA to distal primary cortical neurites. It has previously been shown that abnormal Task3 expression correlates with neuronal dysfunction, we therefore posit that this G4 is required for regulated local expression of Task3 leak channels that maintain K+ leak currents within neurons.",

However, the rapid growth in complexity of data from these assays has outpaced our ability to accurately infer phylogenetic relationships. To address this, we provide three resources. First, we introduce Cassiopeia - a suite of scalable and theoretically grounded maximum parsimony approaches for tree reconstruction. Second, we provide a simulation framework for evaluating algorithms and exploring lineage tracer design principles. Finally, we generate the most complex experimental lineage tracing dataset to date - consisting of 34,557 human cells continuously traced over 15 generations, 71% of which are uniquely marked - and use it for benchmarking phylogenetic inference approaches. We show that Cassiopeia outperforms traditional methods by several metrics and under a wide variety of parameter regimes, and provide insight into the principles for the design of improved Cas9-enabled recorders. Together these should broadly enable large-scale mammalian lineage tracing efforts. Cassiopeia and its benchmarking resources are publicly available at www.github.com/YosefLab/Cassiopeia.",

    "abstract": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) represent a novel class of non-coding RNAs that are emerging as potentially important regulators of gene expression. circRNAs are typically generated from host gene transcripts through a non-canonical back-splicing mechanism, whose regulation is still not well understood. To explore regulation of circRNAs in cancer, we generated sequence data from RNase R-resistant transcripts in human p493-6 B-lymphoid cells and identified thousands of novel as well as previously identified circRNAs. Approximately 40% of expressed genes generated a circRNA, with half of them generating multiple isoforms, suggesting the involvement of alternative back-splicing and regulatory RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). We observed that genes generating circRNAs with back-spliced exonic junctions were enriched for RBP recognition motifs, including multiple splicing factors, most notably SRSF3, a splicing factor known to promote exon inclusion. To test the role of SRSF3 role in circRNA production, we performed traditional RNA-seq in p493-6 B-lymphoid cells with and without SRSF3 knockdown, and identified 926 mRNA transcripts, whose canonical splicing was affected by SRSF3. We found that a subset (205) of these SRSF3 targets served as host transcripts for circRNA, suggesting that SRSF3 may regulate exon circularization. Since this splicing factor is deregulated in hematologic malignancies, we hypothesize that SRSF3-dependent circRNAs, similar to their mRNA counterparts, might contribute to the pathogenesis of lymphomas and leukemias.",

While mutant HTT is present ubiquitously throughout life, HD onset typically occurs in mid-life. Oxidative damage accumulates in the aging brain and is a feature of HD. We sought to interrogate the roles and interaction of age and oxidative stress in HD using primary Hu97/18 mouse neurons, neurons differentiated from HD patient induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and mice. We find that primary neurons must be matured in culture for canonical stress responses to occur. Furthermore, when aging is accelerated in mature HD neurons, mutant HTT accumulates and sensitivity to oxidative stress is selectively enhanced. Furthermore, we observe HD-specific phenotypes in iPSC-derived neurons and mouse brains that have undergone accelerated aging. These findings suggest a role for aging in HD pathogenesis and interaction between biological age of HD neurons and sensitivity to exogenous stress.",

    "abstract": "Tests of association between a phenotype and a set of genes in a biological pathway can provide insights into the genetic architecture of complex phenotypes beyond those obtained from single variant or single gene association analysis. However, most existing gene set tests have limited power to detect gene set-phenotype association when a small fraction of the genes are associated with the phenotype, and no method exists which identifies the potentially \"active\" genes that might drive a gene-set-based association. To address these issues, we have developed Gene-set analysis Association Using Sparse Signals (GAUSS), a method for gene-set association analysis that requires only GWAS summary statistics. For each significantly associated gene set, GAUSS identifies the subset of genes that have the maximal evidence of association and can best account for the gene set association. Using pre-computed correlation structure among test statistics from a reference panel, our p-value calculation is substantially faster than other permutation or simulation-based approaches. In simulations with varying proportions of causal genes, we find that GAUSS effectively controls type 1 error rate and has greater power than several existing methods, particularly when a small proportion of genes account for the gene set signal. Using GAUSS, we analyzed UK Biobank GWAS summary statistics for 10,679 gene-sets and 1,403 binary phenotypes. We found that GAUSS is scalable and identified 13,466 phenotype and gene-set association pairs. Within these genes sets, we identify an average of 17.2 (max=405) genes that underlie these gene set associations.",

    "abstract": "Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) and its patched-smoothened receptor complex control a variety of functions in the developing central nervous system (CNS) such as neural cell proliferation and differentiation. Recently, Shh signaling components have been found to be expressed at the synaptic level in the postnatal brain, suggesting a potential role in the regulation of synaptic transmission. Using in utero electroporation of constitutively active and dominant-negative forms of the Shh co-receptor smoothened (Smo), we studied the role of Smo signaling in the development and maturation of GABAergic transmission in the somatosensory cortex. Our results show that enhancing Smo activity during development accelerates the shift from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing GABA in dependence on functional expression of potassium-chloride cotransporter type 2 (KCC2). On the other hand, blocking Smo activity maintains GABA response in a depolarizing state in mature cortical neurons resulting in altered chloride homeostasis and increased seizure susceptibility. This study reveals an unexpected function of Smo signaling on the regulation of chloride homeostasis through the control of KCC2 cell surface stability and on the timing of the GABA inhibitory/excitatory shift in brain maturation.\n\nSummary statementThe smoothened receptor controls the time course of inhibitory transmission through the stability of the potassium-chloride cotransporter type 2 at the plasma membrane.",

An important class of models hypothesize that listeners decode the intended meaning of an utterance by assuming speakers speak cooperatively, simulating the speakers rational choice process and inverting this process for recovering the speakers most probable meaning. We investigated whether and how rational simulations of speakers are represented in the listeners brain, when subjects participated in a referential communication game inside fMRI. In three experiments, we show that listeners ventromedial prefrontal cortex encodes the probabilistic inference of what a cooperative speaker should say given a communicative goal and context. The listeners striatum responds to the amount of update on the intended meaning, consistent with inverting a simulated mental model. These findings suggest a neural generative mechanism subserved by the frontal-striatal circuits that underlies our ability to understand communicative and, more generally, social actions.",

    "abstract": "With advances in single-cell genomics, molecular signatures of cells comprising the brain vasculature are revealed in unprecedented detail1,2, yet the ageing-associated cell subtype transcriptomic changes which may contribute to neurovascular dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases3-7 remain elusive. Here, we performed single-cell transcriptomic profiling of brain endothelial cells (EC) in young adult and aged mice to characterize their ageing-associated genome-wide expression changes. We identified zonation-dependent transcriptomic changes in aged brain EC subtypes, with capillary ECs exhibiting the most transcriptomic alterations. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed altered immune/cytokine signaling in ECs of all vascular segments, while functional changes impacting the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and glucose/energy metabolism were most prominently implicated in ECs of the capillary bed - the primary site where ECs and other neurovascular unit (NVU) cell types closely interact and coordinate to regulate BBB and cerebral blood flow in health and diseased conditions8-17. Furthermore, an overrepresentation of Alzheimers disease (AD)-associated genes identified from GWAS studies was evident among the human orthologs of differentially expressed genes of aged capillary ECs but not other EC subtypes. Importantly, for numerous EC-enriched differentially expressed genes with important functional roles at the BBB and/or association with AD, we found concordant expression changes in human aged or AD brains. Finally, we demonstrated that treatment with exenatide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist, strongly reverses transcriptomic changes in ECs and largely reduces BBB leakage in the aged brain. Thus, our study provides insights into detailed transcriptomic alterations underlying brain EC ageing that are complex with subtype specificity yet amenable to pharmacological interventions.",

We found that surface VEGFR-2 can be mobile or immobile/confined, and monomeric or non-monomeric, with a complex interplay between the two. The mobility and interaction heterogeneity of VEGFR-2 in the basal state led to heterogeneity in the sequence of steps leading to VEGFR-2 activation by VEGF. Specifically, we found that VEGF can bind to both monomeric and non-monomeric VEGFR-2, and, when binding to monomeric VEGFR-2, promotes dimer formation but only for immobile/confined receptors.

    "abstract": "Zebrafish and urodele amphibians are capable of extraordinary myocardial regeneration thanks to the ability of their cardiomyocytes to undergo transient dedifferentiation and proliferation. Somatic cells can be temporarily reprogrammed to a proliferative, dedifferentiated state through transient expression of Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc (OSKM) transcription factors. Here, we utilized an OSKM-encoding non-integrating vector to induce transient reprogramming of mammalian cardiomyocytes in vitro. Reprogramming factor expression in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes triggered rapid cell dedifferentiation characterized by downregulation of cardiomyocyte specific gene and protein expression, sarcomere dis-assembly and loss of autorhythmic contractile activity. Concomitantly, a significant increase in cell cycle related gene expression and Ki67 positive cells was observed, indicating that dedifferentiated cardiomyocytes possess an enhanced proliferative capacity. A small proportion of cardiomyocytes progressed through mesenchymal to epithelial transition, further indicating the initiation of cell reprogramming. However, complete reprogramming to a pluripotent-like state was not achieved for the duration of the study (20 days), both in standard and embryonic stem cell culture media conditions. The transient nature of this partial reprogramming response was confirmed as cardiomyocyte-specific cell morphology, gene expression and contractile activity were recovered by day 15 after viral transduction. Further investigations into the complete downstream biological effects of ectopic OSKM expression in cardiomyocytes and the fate of these reprogrammed cells are warranted. Our results to date suggest that transient reprogramming could be a feasible strategy to recapitulate regenerative mechanisms of lower vertebrates and inform direct gene therapy approaches to cardiac regenerative medicine.",

Given the interactions among these systems change throughout adolescence, we tested when beneficial effects of value associations on subsequent cognitive control performance emerge during adolescence. Participants (N=81) aged 13-20 completed a reinforcement learning task with four cue-incentive pairings that could yield high gain, low gain, high loss, or low loss outcomes. Next, participants completed a Go/NoGo task during fMRI where the NoGo targets comprised the previously learned cues, which tested how prior value associations influence cognitive control performance. Improved accuracy for previously learned high gain relative to low gain cues emerged with age. Older adolescents exhibited enhanced recruitment of the dorsal striatum and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during cognitive control execution to previously learned high gain relative to low gain cues. Older adolescents also expressed increased coupling between the dorsal striatum and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for high gain cues, whereas younger adolescents expressed increased coupling between the striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. These findings reveal that learned high value cue-incentive associations enhance cognitive control in late adolescence in parallel with value-selective recruitment of corticostriatal systems.",

    "abstract": "Silencing of FMR1 and loss of its gene product FMRP results in Fragile X Syndrome. FMRP binds brain mRNAs and inhibits polypeptide elongation. Using ribosome profiling of the hippocampus, we find that ribosome footprint levels in Fmr1-deficient tissue mostly reflect changes in RNA abundance. Profiling over a time course of ribosome runoff in wildtype tissue reveals a wide range of ribosome translocation rates; on many mRNAs, the ribosomes are stalled. Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation of hippocampal slices after ribosome runoff reveals that FMRP co-sediments with stalled ribosomes; and its loss results in decline of ribosome stalling on specific mRNAs. One such mRNA encodes SETD2, a lysine methyltransferase that catalyzes H3K36me3. ChIP-Seq demonstrates that loss of FMRP alters the deployment of this epigenetic mark on chromatin. H3K36me3 is associated with alternative pre-RNA processing, which we find occurs in an FMRP-dependent manner on transcripts linked to neural function and autism spectrum disorders.\n\nHighlights- Loss of FMRP results in decline of ribosome stalling on specific mRNAs (eg., SETD2)\n- Increased SETD2 protein levels alter H3K36me3 marks in FMRP deficient hippocampus\n- Genome-wide changes in mRNA alternative splicing occur in FMRP deficient hippocampus\n- H3K36me3 marks and alternative splicing changes occur on transcripts linked to autism",

    "abstract": "The reproductive hormones that trigger oocyte meiotic maturation and release from the ovary vary greatly between animal species. Identification of receptors for these Maturation Inducing Hormones (MIHs), and understanding how they initiate the largely conserved maturation process, remain important challenges. In hydrozoan cnidarians including the jellyfish Clytia hemisphaerica, MIH comprises neuropeptides released from somatic cells of the gonad. We identified the receptor (MIHR) for these MIH neuropeptides in Clytia using cell culture-based \\\"deorphanization\\\" of candidate oocyte-expressed GPCRs. MIHR mutant jellyfish generated using CRISPR-Cas9 had severe defects in gamete development or in spawning both in males and females. Female gonads, or oocytes isolated from MIHR mutants, failed to respond to synthetic MIH. Treatment with the cAMP analogue 5Br-cAMP to mimic cAMP rise at maturation onset rescued meiotic maturation and spawning. Injection of inhibitory antibodies to GS into wild type oocytes phenocopied the MIHR mutants. These results provide the molecular links between MIH stimulation and meiosis initiation in hydrozoan oocytes. Molecular phylogeny grouped Clytia MIHR with a subset of bilaterian neuropeptide receptors including Neuropeptide Y, Gonadotropin Inhibitory Hormone, pyroglutamylated RFamide and Luqin, all upstream regulators of sexual reproduction. This identification and functional characterisation of a cnidarian peptide GPCR advances our understanding of oocyte maturation initiation and sheds light on the evolution of neuropeptide-hormone systems.",

All patients were evaluated prior to surgery and reevaluated up until 5 years after the procedure. Scores were standardized to a control group of 54 healthy individuals matched for age and education. Patients were divided in two groups according to the hemisphere affected and scores for immediate and late recall were compared. Reliable Change Index (RCI) with a 90% confidence interval was performed to verify individual memory changes for each late LM (lLM) and late VM (lVM) score. A multiple linear regression was performed with the RCI using late recall scores of lLM and lVM and clinical variables.\\n\\nResults112 (56%) patients had left HS (lHS). The lHS group showed decreased immediate LM (iLM) scores before and after surgery (p<0.05), compared with rHS. The rHS group showed increased iLM scores post-operatively (p<0.05). RCI of the rHS group showed that 6 (7%) individuals had improved, 78 (87%) stabilized and 5 (6%) decresead in lLM scores, and for lVM 7 (8%) improved, 80 (89%) stabilized and 2 (3%) worsened (RCI> 1.645).

Here we studied the activity of putative DA neurons (n=41) recorded in the ventral tegmental area of rats (n=6) performing a behavioural task involving occasion setting. In this task an occasion setter (OS) indicated that the relationship between a discriminative stimulus (DS) and reinforcement is in effect, so that reinforcement of bar pressing occurred only after the OS (tone or houselight) was followed by the DS (houselight or tone). We found that responses of putative DA cells to the DS were enhanced when preceded by the OS, as were behavioural responses to obtain rewards. Surprisingly though, we did not find a population response of putative DA neurons to the OS, contrary to predictions of standard temporal-difference models of DA neurons. However, despite the absence of a population response, putative DA neurons exhibited a heterogeneous response on a single unit level, so that some units increased and others decreased their activity as a response to the OS. Similarly, putative non-DA cells did not respond to the DS on a population level, but with heterogeneous responses on a single unit level. The heterogeneity in the responses of putative DA cells may reflect how DA neurons encode context and point to local differences in DA signalling.",

Normalization of Hi-C contact maps is essential for accurate modeling and interpretation of genome-wide chromatin conformation. Most Hi-C correction methods are originally developed for normal cell lines and mainly target systematic biases. In contrast, cancer genomes carry multi-level copy number variations (CNVs). Copy number influences interaction frequency between genomic loci. Therefore, CNV-driven bias needs to be corrected for generating euploid-equivalent chromatin contact maps.\\n\\nResultsWe developed HiCNAtra framework that extracts read depth (RD) signal from Hi-C or 3C-seq reads to generate the high-resolution CNV profile and use this information to correct the contact map. We proposed the \\\"entire restriction fragment\\\" counting for better estimation of the RD signal and generation of CNV profiles. HiCNAtra integrates CNV information along with other systematic biases for explicitly correcting the interaction matrix using Poisson regression model. We demonstrated that RD estimation of HiCNAtra recapitulates the whole-genome sequencing (WGS)-derived coverage signal of the same cell line. Benchmarking against OneD method (only explicit method to target CNV bias) showed that HiCNAtra fared better in eliminating the impact of CNV on the contact maps.\\n\\nAvailability and implementationHiCNAtra is an open source software implemented in MATLAB and is available at https://github.com/AISKhalil/HiCNAtra.",

    "abstract": "Developmental and/or epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) are a group of devastating genetic disorders, resulting in early onset, therapy resistant seizures and developmental delay. Here we report on 12 individuals from 10 families presenting with a severe form of intractable epilepsy, severe developmental delay, progressive microcephaly and visual disturbance. Whole exome sequencing identified a recurrent, homozygous variant (chr2:64083454A>G) in the essential UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGP2) gene in all probands. This rare variant results in a tolerable Met12Val missense change of the longer UGP2 protein isoform but causes a disruption of the start codon of the shorter isoform. We show that the absence of the shorter isoform leads to a reduction of functional UGP2 enzyme in brain cell types, leading to altered glycogen metabolism, upregulated unfolded protein response and premature neuronal differentiation, as modelled during pluripotent stem cell differentiation in vitro. In contrast, the complete lack of all UGP2 isoforms leads to differentiation defects in multiple lineages in human cells. Reduced expression of Ugp2a/Ugp2b in vivo in zebrafish mimics visual disturbance and mutant animals show a behavioral phenotype. Our study identifies a recurrent start codon mutation in UGP2 as a cause of a novel autosomal recessive DEE. Importantly, it also shows that isoform specific start-loss mutations causing expression loss of a tissue relevant isoform of an essential protein can cause a genetic disease, even when an organism-wide protein absence is incompatible with life. We provide additional examples where a similar disease mechanism applies.",

Alignment of the reads to their appropriate positions in the respective reference genome is the first but costliest step of any analysis pipeline based on SMRT sequencing. However, the state-of-the-art aligners often fail to identify distant homologies due to lack of conserved regions, caused by frequent genetic duplication and recombination. Therefore, we developed a novel alignment-free method of sequence mapping that is fast and accurate.\n\nResultsWe present a new mapper called S-conLSH that uses Spaced context based Locality Sensitive Hashing. With multiple spaced patterns, S-conLSH facilitates a gapped mapping of noisy long reads to the corresponding target locations of a reference genome. We have examined the performance of the proposed method on 5 different real and simulated datasets. S-conLSH is at least 2 times faster than the state-of-the-art alignment-based methods. It achieves a sensitivity of 99%, without using any traditional base-to-base alignment, on human simulated sequence data. By default, S-conLSH provides an alignment-free mapping in PAF format. However, it has an option of generating aligned output as SAM-file, if it is required for any downstream processing.\n\nAvailabilityThe source code of our software is freely available at https://github.com/anganachakraborty/S-conLSH",

    "abstract": "A key step in many genomic analysis pipelines is the identification of regions of similarity between pairs of DNA sequencing reads. This task, known as pairwise sequence alignment, is a heavy computational burden, particularly in the context of third-generation long-read sequencing technologies, which produce noisy reads. This issue is commonly addressed via a two-step approach: first, we filter pairs of reads which are likely to have a large alignment, and then we perform computationally intensive alignment algorithms only on the selected pairs. The Jaccard similarity between the set of k-mers of each read can be shown to be a proxy for the alignment size, and is usually used as the filter. This strategy has the added benefit that the Jaccard similarities dont need to be computed exactly, and can instead be efficiently estimated through the use of min-hashes. This is done by hashing all k-mers of a read and computing the minimum hash value (the min-hash) for each read. For a randomly chosen hash function, the probability that the min-hashes are the same for two distinct reads is precisely their k-mer Jaccard similarity. Hence, one can estimate the Jaccard similarity by computing the fraction of min-hash collisions out of the set of hash functions considered.\n\nHowever, when the k-mer distribution of the reads being considered is significantly non-uniform, Jaccard similarity is no longer a good proxy for the alignment size. In particular, genome-wide GC biases and the presence of common k-mers increase the probability of a min-hash collision, thus biasing the estimate of alignment size provided by the Jaccard similarity. In this work, we introduce a min-hash-based approach for estimating alignment sizes called Spectral Jaccard Similarity which naturally accounts for an uneven k-mer distribution in the reads being compared. The Spectral Jaccard Similarity is computed by considering a min-hash collision matrix (where rows correspond to pairs of reads and columns correspond to different hash functions), removing an offset, and performing a singular value decomposition. The leading left singular vector provides the Spectral Jaccard Similarity for each pair of reads. In addition, we develop an approximation to the Spectral Jaccard Similarity that can be computed with a single matrix-vector product, instead of a full singular value decomposition.\n\nWe demonstrate improvements in AUC of the Spectral Jaccard Similarity based filters over Jaccard Similarity based filters on 40 datasets of PacBio reads from the NCTC collection.

Thus, identification of transcription factor binding sites is key to understanding gene expression and whole regulatory networks within a cell. The standard approaches for transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) prediction such as position weight matrices (PWMs) and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) are widely used but have their drawbacks such as high false positive rates and limited antibody availability, respectively. Several computational footprinting algorithms have been developed to detect TFBSs by investigating chromatin accessibility patterns, but also have their limitations. To improve on these methods, we have developed a footprinting method to predict Transcription factor footpRints in Active Chromatin Elements (TRACE). Trace incorporates DNase-seq data and PWMs within a multivariate Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to detect footprint-like regions with matching motifs. Trace is an unsupervised method that accurately annotates binding sites for specific TFs automatically with no requirement on pre-generated candidate binding sites or ChIP-seq training data.

    "abstract": "The footprint of tomato cultivation, a cool region crop that exhibits heat stress (HS) sensitivity, is increasing in the tropics/sub-tropics. Knowledge of novel regulatory hot-spots from varieties growing in the Indian sub-continent climatic zones could be vital for developing HS-resilient crops. Comparative transcriptome-wide signatures of a tolerant (CLN1621L) and sensitive (CA4) cultivar-pair short-listed from a pool of varieties exhibiting variable thermo-sensitivity using physiological, survival and yield-related traits revealed redundant to cultivar-specific HS-regulation with more up-regulated genes for CLN1621L than CA4. The anatgonisiticly-expressing genes include enzymes; have roles in plant defense and response to different abiotic stresses. Functional characterization of three antagonistic genes by overexpression and TRV-VIGS silencing established Solyc09g014280 (Acylsugar acyltransferase) and Solyc07g056570 (Notabilis), that are up-regulated in tolerant cultivar, as positive regulators of HS-tolerance and Solyc03g020030 (Pin-II proteinase inhibitor), that is down-regulated in CLN1621L, as negative regulator of thermotolerance. Transcriptional assessment of promoters of these genes by SNPs in stress-responsive cis-elements and promoter swapping experiments in opposite cultivar background showed inherent cultivar-specific orchestration of transcription factors in regulating transcription. Moreover, overexpression of three ethylene response transcription factors (ERF.C1/F4/F5) also improved HS-tolerance in tomato. This study identifies several novel HS-tolerance genes and provides proof of their utility in tomato-thermotolerance.\\n\\nHighlightNovel heat stress regulatory pathways uncovered by comparative transcriptome profiling between contrasting tomato cultivars from Indian sub-continent for improving thermotolerance.

    "abstract": "Homologous recombination (HR) has an intimate relationship with genome replication, both during repair of DNA lesions that might prevent DNA synthesis and in tackling stalls to the replication fork. Recent studies led us to ask if HR might have a more central role in replicating the genome of Leishmania, a eukaryotic parasite. Conflicting evidence has emerged regarding whether or not HR genes are essential, and genome-wide mapping has provided evidence for an unorthodox organisation of DNA replication initiation sites, termed origins. To answer this question, we have employed a combined CRISPR/Cas9 and DiCre approach to rapidly generate and assess the effect of conditional ablation of RAD51 and three RAD51-related proteins in Leishmania major. Using this approach, we demonstrate that loss of any of these HR factors is not immediately lethal, but in each case growth slows with time and leads to DNA damage, accumulation of cells with aberrant DNA content, and genome-wide mutation. Despite these similarities, we show that only loss of RAD51 and RAD51-3 impairs DNA synthesis, and that the factors act in distinct ways. Finally, we reveal that loss of RAD51 has a profound effect on DNA replication, causing loss of initiation at the major origins and increased DNA synthesis at subtelomeres. Our work clarifies questions regarding the importance of HR to survival of Leishmania and reveals an unanticipated, central role for RAD51 in the programme of genome replication in a microbial eukaryote.",

    "abstract": "Rpb4/7 binds RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) transcripts co-transcriptionally and accompanies them throughout their lives. By virtue of its capacity to interact with key regulators (e.g., Pol II, eIF3, Pat1) both temporarily and spatially, Rpb4/7 regulates the major stages of the mRNA lifecycle. Here we show that Rpb4/7 can undergo over 100 combinations of post-translational modifications (PTMs). Remarkably, the Rpb4/7 PTMs repertoire changes as the mRNA/Rpb4/7 complex progresses from one stage to the next. A mutagenesis approach in residues that undergo PTMs suggests that temporal Rpb4 PTMs regulate its interactions with key regulators of gene expression that control transcriptional and post-transcriptional stages. Moreover, one mutant type specifically affects mRNA synthesis despite its normal association with Pol II, whereas the other affects both mRNA synthesis and decay; both types disrupt the balance between mRNA synthesis and decay ( mRNA buffering) and the cells capacity to respond to the environment. Taken together, we propose that temporal Rpb4/7 PTMs are involved in cross talks among the various stages of the mRNA lifecycle.",

    "abstract": "The protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi has a complicated dual-host life cycle, and starvation can trigger transition from the replicating insect stage to the mammalian-infectious nonreplicating insect stage (epimastigote to trypomastigote differentiation). Abundance of some mature RNAs derived from its mitochondrial genome increase during culture starvation of T. cruzi for unknown reasons. Here we examine T. cruzi mitochondrial gene expression in the mammalian intracellular replicating life stage (amastigote), and uncover implications of starvation-induced changes in gene expression in insect-stage cells. Mitochondrial RNA levels in general were found to be lowest in actively replicating amastigotes. We discovered that mitochondrial respiration decreases during starvation, despite the previously-observed increases in mitochondrial mRNAs encoding electron transport chain components. Surprisingly, T. cruzi epimastigotes in replete medium grow at normal rates when we genetically compromised their ability to perform insertion/deletion editing and thereby generate mature forms of some mitochondrial mRNAs. However, these cells, when starved, were impeded in the epimastigote to trypomastigote transition. Further, they experience a short-flagella phenotype that may also be linked to differentiation. We hypothesize a scenario where levels of mature RNA species or editing in the single T. cruzi mitochondrion are linked to differentiation by a yet-unknown signaling mechanism.",

Such dynamics have primarily been studied in the context of rivalry between two percepts, but there is growing interest in the neural mechanisms that drive rivalry between more than two percepts. In recent experiments, we showed that split images presented to each eye lead to subjects perceiving four stochastically alternating percepts (Jacot-Guillarmod et al., 2017): two single eye images and two interocularly grouped images. Here we propose a hierarchical neural network model that exhibits dynamics consistent with our experimental observations. The model consists of two levels, with the first representing monocular activity, and the second representing activity in higher visual areas. The model produces stochastically switching solutions, whose dependence on task parameters is consistent with four generalized Levelt Propositions. Our neuromechanistic model also allowed us to probe the roles of inter-actions between populations at the network levels. Stochastic switching at the lower level representing alternations between single eye percepts dominated, consistent with experiments.",

Previously we showed that LRx-induced perisynaptic proteolysis of extracellular substrates by MMP9 mediates the enhanced plasticity in binocular adult mice (Murase et al., 2017). However, it is unknown if a visual system compromised by amblyopia could engage this pathway. Here we show that LRx to adult amblyopic mice induces perisynaptic MMP2/9 activity and degradation of ECM in the deprived and non-deprived V1. LRx restricted to the amblyopic eye induces equally robust MMP2/9 activity at thalamo-cortical synapses and ECM degradation in deprived V1. Two-photon live imaging demonstrates that the history of visual experience regulates MMP2/9 activity in V1, and that DE lowers the threshold for the proteinase activation. This homeostatic reduction of MMP2/9 activation threshold by DE enables the visual input from the amblyopic pathway to trigger robust perisynaptic proteolysis.",

    "abstract": "Social cues of threat are widely reported [1-3], whether actively produced to trigger responses in others, such as the emission of alarm calls, or by-products of an encounter with a predator, like the defensive behaviors themselves, such as an escape flight [4-14]. Although the recognition of social alarm cues is often innate [15-17], in some instances it requires experience to trigger defensive responses [4,7]. One mechanism proposed for how learning from self-experience contributes to social behavior is that of auto-conditioning, whereby subjects learn to associate their own behaviors with the relevant trigger events. Through this process the same behaviors, now displayed by others, gain meaning. [18,19 but see: 20]. Although it has been shown that only animals with prior experience with shock display observational freezing [21-25] suggesting that auto-conditioning could mediate this process, evidence for this hypothesis was lacking. Previously we found that when a rat freezes, the silence that results from immobility triggers observational freezing in its cage-mate, provided the cage-mate had experienced shocks before [24]. Hence, in our study auto-conditioning would correspond to rats learning to associate shock with their own response to it - freezing. Using a combination of behavioral and optogenetic manipulations, here we show that freezing becomes an alarm cue by a direct association with shock. Our work shows that auto-conditioning can indeed modulate social interactions, expanding the repertoire of cues that mediate social information exchange, providing a framework to study how the neural circuits involved in the self-experience of defensive behaviors overlap with the ones involved in socially triggered defensive behaviors.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation is a highly studied epigenetic signature that is associated with regulation of gene expression, whereby genes with high levels of promoter methylation are generally repressed. Genomic imprinting occurs when one of the parental alleles is methylated, i.e, when there is inherited allele-specific methylation (ASM). A special case of imprinting occurs during X chromosome inactivation in females, where one of the two X chromosomes is silenced, in order to achieve dosage compensation between the sexes. Another more widespread form of ASM is sequence dependent (SD-ASM), where ASM is linked to a nearby heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP).\\n\\nWe developed a method to screen for genomic regions that exhibit loss or gain of ASM in samples from two conditions (treatments, diseases, etc.). The method relies on the availability of bisulfite sequencing data from multiple samples of the two conditions. We leverage other established computational methods to screen for these regions within a new R package called DAMEfinder. It calculates an ASM score for all CpG sites or pairs in the genome of each sample, and then quantifies the change in ASM between conditions. It then clusters nearby CpG sites with consistent change into regions.\\n\\nIn the absence of SNP information, our method relies only on reads to quantify ASM. This novel ASM score compares favourably to current methods that also screen for ASM. Not only does it easily discern between imprinted and non-imprinted regions, but also females from males based on X chromosome inactivation. We also applied DAMEfinder to a colorectal cancer dataset and observed that colorectal cancer subtypes are distinguishable according to their ASM signature. We also re-discover known cases of loss of imprinting.\\n\\nWe have designed DAMEfinder to detect regions of differential ASM (DAMEs), which is a more refined definition of differential methylation, and can therefore help in breaking down the complexity of DNA methylation and its influence in development and disease.",

Many microbiome studies characterize only the bacterial component, for which there are several well-developed sequencing methods, bioinformatics tools and databases available. The lack of comprehensive bioinformatics workflows and databases have limited efforts to characterize the other components existing in a microbiome. BiomeSeq is a tool for the analysis of the complete animal microbiome using metagenomic sequencing data. With its comprehensive workflow, customizable parameters and microbial databases, BiomeSeq can rapidly quantify the viral, fungal, bacteriophage and bacterial components of a sample and produce informative tables for analysis. BiomeSeq was employed in detecting and quantifying the respiratory microbiome of a commercial poultry broiler flock throughout its grow-out cycle from hatching to processing. It successfully processed 780 million reads, of which 5,163 aligned to avian DNA viral genomes, 71,936 aligned to avian RNA viral genomes, 469,937 aligned to bacterial genomes, 504,682 aligned to bacteriophage genomes and 1,964 aligned to fungal genomes. For each microbial species detected, BiomeSeq calculated the normalized abundance, percent relative abundance, and coverage as well as the diversity for each sample. BiomeSeq provides for the detection and quantification of the microbiome from next-generation metagenomic sequencing data. This tool is implemented into a user-friendly container that requires one command and generates a table consisting of taxonomical information for each microbe detected as well as normalized abundance, percent relative abundance, coverage and diversity calculations.",

We show that these two mechanisms are interconnected, with RhoA signalling activity reducing Arf1 recruitment to the plasma membrane. Additionally, cell adhesion itself regulates both mechanisms: p120-catenin, a regulator of intercellular adhesion, promotes the activity of both Arf1 and RhoA. Altogether, we uncover a complex network of interactions between cell-cell adhesion, the endocytic machinery, and the actomyosin cortex, and demonstrate how this network regulates cell shape in an epithelial tissue in vivo.",

To address these questions, one of the most frequently-used algorithm is based on principal component analysis (PCA). When PCA is applied to temporal samples, the sample dates are, however, ignored during analysis, which could lead to some misinterpretations of the results. Here we introduce a new factor analysis (FA) method for which individual scores are corrected for the effect of allele frequency drift through time. Based on a diffusion approximation, our approach approximates allele frequency drift in a random mating population by a Brownian process. Exact solutions for estimates of corrected factors are obtained, and a fast estimation algorithm is presented. We compared data representations obtained from the FA method with PCA and with PC projections in simulations of divergence and admixture scenarios. Then we applied FA with correction for temporal drift to study the evolution of hepatitis C virus in a patient infected by multiple strains, and to describe the population structure of ancient European samples.",

Therefore, these indices are inadequate when the aim of the study is to compare heterosis levels between different traits, environments, genetic backgrounds or developmental stages, as these factors may affect not only heterosis but also parental values. The only relevant index for such comparisons is the so-called \"potence ratio\".

Here, we present de novo genome assemblies of five isolates from the basal genus Symbiodinium, encompassing distinct ecological niches. Incorporating existing data from Symbiodiniaceae and other Suessiales (15 genome datasets in total), we investigated genome features that are common or unique to these Symbiodiniaceae, to genus Symbiodinium, and to the individual species S. microadriaticum and S. tridacnidorum. Our whole-genome comparisons reveal extensive sequence divergence, with no sequence regions common to all 15. Based on similarity of k-mers from whole-genome sequences, the distances among Symbiodinium isolates are similar to those between isolates of distinct genera. We observed extensive structural rearrangements among symbiodiniacean genomes; those from two distinct Symbiodinium species share the most (853) syntenic gene blocks. Functions enriched in genes core to Symbiodiniaceae are also enriched in those core to Symbiodinium. Gene functions related to symbiosis and stress response exhibit similar relative abundance in all analysed genomes. Our results suggest that structural rearrangements contribute to genome sequence divergence in Symbiodiniaceae even within a same species, but the gene functions have remained largely conserved in Suessiales. This is the first comprehensive comparison of Symbiodiniaceae based on whole-genome sequence data, including comparisons at the intra-genus and intra-species levels.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic variants of the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus called SARC have evolved heritable traits including extreme acid resistance, enhanced genome integrity and a conserved \\\"SARC\\\" transcriptome related to acid resistance. These traits appear to result from altered chromatin protein function related to the heritable hypomethylation of chromatin proteins Cren7 and Sso7D. To clarify how this might occur, ChIPseq and Affinity Purification Mass Spectrometry (AP-MS) were used to compare Cren7 and Sso7D genome binding sites and protein networks between lineages (wild type and SARC) and culture pH (pH 1 and 3). All SARC transcriptome loci were bound by these chromatin proteins but with invariant patterns indicating binding alone was insufficient to mediate the SARC traits. In contrast, chromosome association varied at other loci. Quantitative AP-MS was then used to identify protein interaction networks and these included transcription and DNA repair proteins implicated in the evolved heritable traits that varied in abundance between SARC and wild type strains. Protein networks included most of the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) synthesis pathway including serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), whose abundance varied widely with culture pH. Because epigenetic marks are coupled to SAM pools and oxidative stress in eukaryotes, occurrence of a similar process was investigated here. Archaeal SAM pools were depleted by treatment with SAM pathway inhibitors, acid or oxidative stress and, like eukaryotes, levels were raised by vitamin B12 and methionine supplementation. We propose that in archaea, oxidation-induced SAM pool depletion acting through an SHMT sensor, drove chromatin protein hypomethylation and thereby protein network changes that established the evolved SARC epigenetic traits.\\n\\nSignificance StatementArchaea and eukaryotes share many molecular processes, including chromatin-mediated epigenetic inheritance of traits. As with eukaryotes, archaeal protein complexes were formed between trait-related proteins and chromatin proteins, subject to chromatin protein methylation state. Oxidation-induced depletion of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) pools likely resulted in chromatin protein hypomethylation. Subsequent chromatin enrichment of serine hydroxymethyltransferase as a response to oxidative stress could modulate methylation at specific genomic loci. The interplay between archaeal metabolism and chromatin appear consistent with patterns observed in eukaryotes and indicate the existence of an ancient oxidation signal transduction pathway controlling epigenetics.",

    "abstract": "Recurrent neural network models have become widely used in computational neuroscience to model the dynamics of neural populations as well as in machine learning applications to model data with temporal dependencies. The different variants of RNNs commonly used in these scientific fields can be derived as discrete time approximations of the instantaneous firing rate of a population of neurons. The time constants of the neuronal process are generally ignored in these approximations, while learning these time constants could possibly inform us about the time scales underlying temporal processes and enhance the expressive capacity of the network. To investigate the potential of adaptive time constants, we compare the standard Elman approximation to a more lenient one that still accounts for the time scales at which processes unfold. We show that such a model with adaptive time scales performs better on predicting temporal data, increasing the memory capacity of recurrent neural networks, and allows recovery of the time scales at which the underlying processes unfold.",

    "abstract": "Complex visual processing involved in perceiving the object materials can be better elucidated by taking a variety of research approaches. Sharing stimulus and response data is an effective strategy to make the results of different studies directly comparable and can assist researchers with different backgrounds to jump into the field. Here, we constructed a database containing several sets of material images annotated with visual discrimination performance. We created the material images using physically-based computer graphics techniques and conducted psychophysical experiments with them in both laboratory and crowdsourcing settings. The observers task was to discriminate materials on one of six dimensions (gloss contrast, gloss distinctness-of-image, translucent vs. opaque, metal vs. plastic, metal vs. glass, and glossy vs. painted). The illumination consistency and object geometry were also varied. We used a non-verbal procedure (an oddity task) applicable for diverse use-cases such as cross-cultural, cross-species, clinical, or developmental studies. Results showed that the material discrimination depended on the illuminations and geometries and that the ability to discriminate the spatial consistency of specular highlights in glossiness perception showed larger individual differences than in other tasks. In addition, analysis of visual features showed that the parameters of higher-order color texture statistics can partially, but not completely, explain task performance. The results obtained through crowdsourcing were highly correlated with those obtained in the laboratory, suggesting that our database can be used even when the experimental conditions are not strictly controlled in the laboratory. Several projects using our dataset are underway.",

We have used single nucleus RNASeq (snRNASeq) to uncover cellular phenotypes that change in the disease, investigating single cell gene expression in cingulate cortex of patients with HD and comparing the gene expression to that of patients with no neurological disease. In this study, we focused on astrocytes, although we found significant gene expression differences in neurons, oligodendrocytes, and microglia as well. In particular, the gene expression profiles of astrocytes in HD showed multiple signatures, varying in phenotype from cells that had markedly upregulated metallothionein and heat shock genes, but had not completely lost the expression of genes associated with normal protoplasmic astrocytes, to astrocytes that had substantially upregulated GFAP and had lost expression of many normal protoplasmic astrocyte genes as well as metallothionein genes. When compared to astrocytes in control samples, astrocyte signatures in HD also showed downregulated expression of a number of genes, including several associated with protoplasmic astrocyte function and lipid synthesis. Thus, HD astrocytes appeared in variable transcriptional phenotypes, and could be divided into several different \\\"states\\\", defined by patterns of gene expression. Ultimately, this study begins to fill the knowledge gap of single cell gene expression in HD and provide a more detailed understanding of the variation in changes in gene expression during astrocyte \\\"reactions\\\" to the disease.",

We constructed two CRISPR mutant zebrafish with mutations located in the N-terminus region. The first is a 6BP+1 insertion deletion frameshift resulting in a truncated protein. The second is a 3BP in frame deletion with intact binding domains. ERG recordings showed that the 6BP+1 mutants did not respond to red wavelengths of light while the 3BP mutants did respond. 6BP+1 mutants lacked optomotor and optokinetic responses to red/black and green/black contrasts. Adult 6BP+1 mutants exhibit a loss of red-cone contribution to the ERG, and an increase in green and UV contributions. Anatomical markers show loss of red-cones in the 6BP+1 mutant but increase in blue, green, and UV cone density. Our results confirm tr{beta}2s role in retinal cone development.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThere are four cone photoreceptors responsible for color vision in zebrafish: red, green, blue, and UV. The thyroid hormone receptor tr{beta}2 is localized in the vertebrate retina. We know that it is necessary for the development of long-wavelength-sensitive cones (red), but here we investigate the functional alterations that accompany a loss of tr{beta}2. Our work contributes to the ongoing investigations of retinal development and the involvement of thyroid hormone receptors. Confirming previous morphological findings, we see that the fish become red colorblind when tr{beta}2 is knocked out, but the contributions of the other three cone types shift in response. Our work highlights the plasticity of the retinal circuit as we see changes in opsin peaks and cone sensitivity, increases in contributions of UV cones, and an attempt at a mosaic pattern in the adult retina all in the absence of tr{beta}2 and red cones. We now have an increased understanding of mechanisms underlying retinal development",

    "abstract": "Inherent nanometer-sized features and molecular recognition properties make DNA a useful material in constructing nanoscale objects, with alluring applications in biosensing and drug delivery. However, DNA can be easily degraded by nucleases present in biological fluids, posing a considerable roadblock to realizing the full potential of DNA nanotechnology for biomedical applications. Here we investigated the nuclease resistance and biostability of the multi-stranded motif called paranemic crossover (PX) DNA and discovered a remarkable and previously unreported resistance to nucleases. We show that PX DNA has more than an order of magnitude increased resistance to degradation by DNase I, serum, and urine compared to double stranded DNA. We further demonstrate that the degradation resistance decreases monotonically as DNA crossovers are removed from the structure, suggesting that frequent DNA crossovers disrupt either the binding or catalysis of nucleases or both. Further, we show using mouse and human cell lines that PX DNA does not affect cell proliferation or interfere with biological processes such as myogenesis. These results have important implications for building DNA nanostructures with enhanced biostability, either by adopting PX-based architectures or by carefully engineering crossovers. We contend that such crossover-dependent nuclease resistance could potentially be used to add \"tunable biostability\" to the many features of DNA nanotechnology.",

    "abstract": "Various PCR based methods have been described for the diagnosis of malaria, but most depend on the use of Plasmodium species-specific probes and primers; hence only the tested species are identified and there is limited available data on the true circulating species diversity. Sensitive diagnostic tools and platforms for their use are needed to detect Plasmodium species in both clinical cases and asymptomatic infections that contribute to disease transmission. We have been recently developed for the first time a novel high throughput  haemoprotobiome metabarcoded DNA sequencing method and applied it for the quantification of haemoprotozoan parasites (Theleria and Babesia) of livestock. Here, we describe a novel, high throughput method using an Illumina MiSeq platform to demonstrate the proportions of Plasmodium species in metabarcoded DNA samples derived from human malaria patients. Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax positive control gDNA was used to prepare mock DNA pools of parasites to evaluate the detection threshold of the assay for each of the two species and to assess the accuracy of proportional quantification. We then applied the assay to malaria-positive human samples to show the species composition of Plasmodium communities in the Punjab province of Pakistan and in the Afghanistan-Pakistan tribal areas. The diagnostic performance of the deep amplicon sequencing method was compared to an immunochromatographic assay that is widely used in the region. Metabarcoded DNA sequencing showed better diagnostic performance, greatly increasing the estimated prevalence of Plasmodium infection. The next-generation sequencing method using metabarcoded DNA has potential applications in the diagnosis, surveillance, treatment, and control of Plasmodium infections, as well as to study the parasite biology.",

    "abstract": "The epigenome modulates the activity of genes and supports the stability of the genome. The epigenome can also contain phenotypically relevant, heritable marks that may vary at the organismic and population level. Such non-genetic standing variation may be relevant to ecological and evolutionary processes. To identify loci susceptible to selection, it is common to profile large populations at the genome scale, yet methods to perform such scans for epigenetic diversity are barely tapped. Here, we develop a scalable, information-theoretic approach to assess epigenome diversity based on Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) and demonstrate its practicality by measuring cell type-specific methylation diversity in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. DNA methylation diversity tends to be increased in the CG as compared to the non-CG (CHG and CHH) sequence context but the tissue or cell type has an impact on diversity at non-CG sites. Less accessible, more heterochromatic states of chromatin exhibit increased diversity. Genes tend to carry more single-methylation polymorphisms when they harbor gene body-like chromatin signatures and flank transposable elements (TEs). In conclusion, the analysis of DNA methylation with JSD in Arabidopsis demonstrates that the genomic location of a gene dominates its methylation diversity, in particular the proximity to TEs which are increasingly viewed as drivers of evolution. Importantly, the JSD-based approach we implemented here is applicable to any population-level epigenomic data set to analyze variation in epigenetic marks among individuals, tissues, or cells of any organism, including the epigenetic heterogeneity of cells in healthy or diseased organs such as tumors.",

Early detection of tumors at initial diagnosis or during routine surveillance is important for improving survival outcomes. Molecular profiling of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a promising noninvasive tool for monitoring disease status. Here, we investigated the feasible of ctDNA detection in ENTKL.\n\nMethodsPlasma ctDNA was assessment were based on blood specimens that were collected from 65 patients recently diagnosed with ENKTL at the hematology medical center of Xinqiao Hospital, longitudinal samples collected under chemotherapy also included. Gene mutation spectrum of ENKTL was analyzed via cancer personalized profiling sequencing (CAPP-Seq). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (ChiCTR1800014813)\n\nResultsFrom February 2017 to September 2019, 65 patients were enrolled, we found that the most frequently mutated genes were KMT2D (23.1%), APC (12.3%), ATM (10.8%), ASXL3 (9.2%), JAK3 (9.2%), SETD2 (9.2%), TP53 (9.2%), NOTCH1 (7.7%). The mutation frequencies of KMT2D was significantly higher in stage III-IV, and mutations in KMT2D, ASXL3 and JAK3 were significantly correlated with the metabolic tumor burden of the patients. Compared with tumor tissue DNA, ctDNA profiling showed good concordance. Serial ctDNA analysis showed that treatment with chemotherapy could decrease the number and mutation allele frequency of genes. Compared with PET/CT, ctDNA has more advantages for tracking residual disease in patients. In addition, we also found that mutated KMT2D predicted poor prognosis in patients.\n\nConclusionCollectively, our results provide evidence that ctDNA may serve as a novel precision medicine biomarker in ENKTL.",

Despite efforts, the research and development process is still long and costly and efficient computational design tools are required to explore the chemical biosynthetic space.

We implement this method in RetroPath RL, an open-source and modular command line tool. We validate it on a golden dataset of 20 manually curated experimental pathways as well as on a larger dataset of 152 successful metabolic engineering projects.

Using genome sequences, we show that invasive populations of the African fig fly, Zaprionus indianus, have lower levels of genetic diversity compared to native populations, and that genetic diversity is lost more in regions of the genome with low recombination rates. However, genetic diversity remains as high or higher in invasive populations than in populations of non-invasive congeneric species. We then use parameter estimates from thermal performance curves measured for 13 species of Zaprionus to show that Z. indianus has the broadest thermal niche of measured species, and that performance does not differ between invasive and native populations. These results illustrate how aspects of genetic diversity in invasive species can be decoupled from measures of fitness, and that a broad thermal niche may have helped facilitate Z. indianuss range expansion.",

    "abstract": "One of the most useful models in population genetics is that of a selective sweep and the consequent hitch-hiking of linked neutral alleles. While variations on this model typically assume constant population size, many instances of strong selection and rapid adaptation in nature may co-occur with complex demography. Here we extend the hitch-hiking model to evolutionary rescue, where adaptation and demography not only co-occur but are intimately entwined. Our results show how this feedback between demography and evolution determines - and restricts - the genetic signatures of evolutionary rescue, and how these differ from the signatures of sweeps in populations of constant size. In particular, we find rescue to harden sweeps from standing variance or new mutation (but not from migration), reduce genetic diversity both at the selected site and genome-wide, and increase the range of observed Tajimas D values. For a given initial rate of population decline, the feedback between demography and evolution makes all of these differences more dramatic under weaker selection, where bottlenecks are prolonged. Nevertheless, it is likely difficult to infer the co-incident timing of the sweep and bottleneck from these simple signatures, never-mind a feedback between them. Temporal samples spanning contemporary rescue events may offer one way forward.",

    "abstract": "Circular RNAs (circRNA) are evolutionary conserved non-coding RNAs resulting from the backsplicing of precursor messengers. Recently, a circular-transcriptome-wide study of circRNA in brain tissue from patients with Alzheimers disease (AD) has revealed a striking association between the expression of circRNA and AD pathological diagnosis. In the present study, we aimed at replicating the major findings in an independent case series comprising definitive sporadic and familial AD. In order to assess the specificity of circRNA changes, we also included cases with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), comprising brain specimens with TDP-43 aggregates (FTLD-TDP43) and samples that presented Tau accumulation (FTLD-Tau). Through a quantitative PCR approach, we evaluated a total of eight circRNAs that surpassed the significant threshold in the former meta-analysis (circHOMER1, circDOCK1, circKCNN2, circMAN2A1, circFMN1, circRTN4, circMAP7, and circPICALM). Average expression changes between AD patients and controls followed the same directions as previously reported, suggesting an overall upregulation of circDOCK1, circMAP7, circMAN2A1, circRTN4 and circPICALM, and a downregulation of the remainder (circHOMER1, circFMN1 and circKCNN2) in AD brain tissue. We also confirmed an exacerbated alteration in circRNA expression in the Mendelian AD group compared to the sporadic forms. Two circRNAs, circHOMER1 and circKCNN2, also showed significant expression alterations in the group of FTLD-Tau and FTLD-TDP43, respectively. Overall, these results reinforce the conception that expression of circRNAs is altered in Alzheimers disease, and also suggest a wider involvement of this particular class of RNA in other neurodegenerative dementias.",

Modulation of gene expression is an urgent need to redesign P. putida metabolism for its improvement as biocatalyst at industrial level. We report the construction of a small RNA-based system with potential to be used for different purposes in synthetic biology. Due to their modular composition, design facilities and ability in tuning gene expression, sRNAs constitute a powerful tool in genetic and metabolic engineering. In the toolbox presented here, the synthetic sRNA is specifically directed to any region of a chosen target. The expression of the synthetic sRNAs is shown to differentially modulate the level of endogenous and reporter genes. The antisense interaction of the sRNA with the mRNA results in different outcomes. Depending on the particularity of each sRNA-target mRNA pair, we managed to demonstrate the duality of this system, able either to repress or overexpress a given gene. This system combines a high specificity with a wide applicability due to its ability to modulate the expression of virtually any given gene. By plugging-in and -out genetic circuits, this tailor-made regulatory system can be used to redesign P. putida metabolism, fulfilling an important industrial gap in synthetic biology.",

    "abstract": "The accurate clinical interpretation of human sequence variation is foundational to personalized medicine. This remains a pressing challenge, however, as genome sequencing becomes routine and new functionally undefined variants rapidly accumulate. Here, we describe a platform for the rapid generation, characterization and interpretation of genomic variants in haploid cells focusing on Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) as an example. NPC is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a lysosomal accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and glycolipids. In 95% of cases, NPC is caused by mutations in the NPC1 gene, where over 200 unique disease-causing variants have been reported to date. Furthermore, the majority of patients with NPC are compound heterozygotes that often carry at least one private mutation, presenting a challenge for the characterization and classification of individual variants. Here, we have developed the first haploid cell model of NPC. This haploid cell model recapitulates the primary biochemical and molecular phenotypes typically found in patient-derived fibroblasts, illustrating its utility in modelling NPC. Additionally, we demonstrate the power of CRISPR-Cas9-mediated base editing in quickly and efficiently generating haploid cell models of individual patient variants in NPC. These models provide a platform for understanding the disease mechanisms underlying individual NPC1 variants while allowing for definitive clinical variant interpretation for NPC. While this study has focused on modelling NPC, the outlined approach could be translated widely and applied to a variety of genetic disorders or understanding the pathogenicity of somatic mutations in cancer.",

    "abstract": "Natural products have traditionally been discovered through the screening of culturable microbial isolates from all sort of environments. The sequencing revolution allowed the identification of dozens of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) within single bacterial genomes, either from cultured or uncultured strains. However, we are still far from fully exploiting the microbial reservoir, as most of the species are non-model organisms with complex regulatory systems and yet recalcitrant to be engineered. Today, genomic and metagenomic data produced by laboratories worldwide covering the most different natural and artificial environments on Earth, are an invaluable source of raw information from which natural product biosynthesis can be accessed. In the present work, we describe the environmental distribution and evolution of the abyssomicin BGC through the analysis of publicly available genomic and metagenomic data. Our results demonstrate that the selection of a pathway-specific enzyme to direct the genome mining is an excellent strategy that led to the identification of 74 new Diels-Alderase homologs and unveiled a surprising prevalence of the abyssomicin BGC within terrestrial habitats, mainly soil and plant-associated, where we have identified five complete and 12 partial new abyssomicin BGCs and 23 new potential abyssomicin BGCs. Our results strongly support the potential of genome and metagenome mining as a key preliminary tool to inform bioprospecting strategies aiming at the identification of new bioactive compounds such as -but not restricted to-abyssomicins.",

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by inactivation of the FMR1 gene and loss of encoded FMRP, an RNA binding protein that represses translation of some of its target transcripts. Here we use ribosome profiling and RNA-seq to investigate the dysregulation of translation in the mouse brain cortex. We find that most changes in ribosome occupancy on hundreds of mRNAs are largely driven by dysregulation in transcript abundance. Many downregulated mRNAs, which are mostly responsible for neuronal and synaptic functions, are highly enriched for FMRP binding targets. RNA metabolic labeling demonstrates that in FMRP-deficient cortical neurons, mRNA downregulation is caused by elevated degradation, and is correlated with codon optimality. Moreover, FMRP preferentially binds mRNAs with optimal codons, suggesting that it stabilizes such transcripts through direct interactions via the translational machinery. Finally, we show that the paradigm of genetic rescue of FXS-like phenotypes in FMRP-deficient mice by deletion of the Cpeb1 gene is mediated by restoration of steady state RNA levels and consequent rebalancing of translational homeostasis. Our data establish an essential role of FMRP in codon optimality-dependent mRNA stability as an important factor in FXS.",

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance (rsfMRI) work has revealed changes in static connectivity related to age, sex, cognitive abilities and psychiatric symptoms, yet little is known how these factors may alter the information flow. The commonly used approach infers functional brain connectivity using stationary coefficients yielding static estimates of the undirected connection strength between brain regions. Dynamic graphical models (DGMs) are a multivariate model with dynamic coefficients reflecting directed temporal associations between nodes, and can yield novel insight into directed functional connectivity. Here, we leveraged this approach to test for associations between edge-wise estimates of direction flow across the brain connectome and age, sex, intellectual abilities and mental health.\n\nMethodsWe applied DGM to investigate patterns of information flow in data from 984 individuals from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and 10,249 individuals from the UK Biobank.\n\nResultsOur analysis yielded patterns of directed connectivity in independent HCP and UK Biobank data similar to those previously reported, including that the cerebellum consistently receives information from other networks. We show robust associations between information flow and age and sex for several connections, with strongest effects of age observed in the sensorimotor network. Visual, auditory and sensorimotor nodes were also linked to mental health.\n\nDiscussionOur findings support the use of DGM as a measure of directed connectivity in rsfMRI data and provide new insight into the shaping of the connectome during aging.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale microelectrode arrays offers enhanced spatiotemporal resolution in electrophysiology studies.. In this paper, we discuss the design and performance of an electrochemical detector array which is capable of 1024-ch parallel cyclic voltammetry (CV) as well as other electrochemical measurements. The electrochemical detector is fabricated using a custom-designed CMOS chip which integrates both the circuity and on-chip microelectrode array, to operate and record from electrochemical measurements. For parallel 1024-ch recordings, 1024 capacitor-based integrating transimpedance amplifiers (TIA) are designed and integrated. The TIA design features the bipolar capabilities for measuring both negative and positive electrochemical currents due to reduction and oxidation of molecules. The resulted dynamic range of this TIA is -700 pA - 1968 pA. CV can be used to examine the quality of electrochemical electrodes by measuring the double-layer capacitance. Double-layer capacitance forms at the electrode-electrolyte interface and is a function of the effective area of the electrode. Thus, a contaminated electrode can have smaller effective area resulting in smaller double-layer capacitance. Using the parallel CV capability of the monolithic CMOS device, the double layer capacitance of all 1024 electrodes are simultaneously measured to examine the status of the electrodes surface in real time. The initial measurement of the electrode array showed a mean capacitance of 466 pF. After plasma treatment to remove contamination on the electrodes surface, the increased capacitance was 1.36nF nearly tripling the effective surface area. We have successfully developed of 1024-ch electrochemical detector array using the monolithic CMOS sensor. The CV functionality was validated by measuring the double-layer capacitance of the on-chip electrode array. This method can accelerate the characterization of a massive electrode array before analytical experiments to provide well-controlled electrochemical electrodes, which is crucial in conducting reliable electrochemical measurements.",

    "abstract": "Beneficial modulation of the gut microbiome has high-impact implications not only in humans, but also in livestock that sustain our current societal needs. In this context, we have tailored an acetylated galactoglucomannan (AcGGM) fibre to match unique enzymatic capabilities of Roseburia and Faecalibacterium species, both renowned butyrate-producing gut commensals. The accuracy of AcGGM was tested within the complex endogenous gut microbiome of pigs, wherein we resolved 355 metagenome-assembled genomes together with quantitative metaproteomes. In AcGGM-fed pigs, both target populations differentially expressed AcGGM-specific polysaccharide utilization loci, including novel, mannan-specific esterases that are critical to its deconstruction. However, AcGGM-inclusion also manifested a \"butterfly effect\", whereby numerous metabolic changes and interdependent cross-feeding pathways were detected in neighboring non-mannolytic populations that produce short-chain fatty acids. Our findings show that intricate structural features and acetylation patterns of dietary fibre can be customized to specific bacterial populations, with potential to create greater modulatory effects at large.",

    "abstract": "Concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) bridge brain connectivity across timescales. During concurrent EEG-fMRI resting-state recordings, whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) strength is spatially correlated across modalities. However, cross-modal investigations have commonly remained correlational, and joint analysis of EEG-fMRI connectivity is largely unexplored.\n\nHere we investigated if there exist (spatially) independent FC networks linked between modalities. We applied the recently proposed hybrid connectivity independent component analysis (connICA) framework to two concurrent EEG-fMRI resting state datasets (total 40 subjects). Two robust components were found across both datasets. The first component has a uniformly distributed EEG-frequency fingerprint linked mainly to intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) in both modalities. Conversely, the second component is sensitive to different EEG-frequencies and is primarily linked to intra-ICN connectivity in fMRI but to inter-ICN connectivity in EEG.\n\nThe first hybrid component suggests that connectivity dynamics within well-known ICNs span timescales, from millisecond-range in all canonical frequencies of FCEEG to second-range of FCfMRI. Conversely, the second component additionally exposes linked but spatially divergent neuronal processing at the two timescales. This work reveals the existence of joint spatially independent components, suggesting that parts of resting-state connectivity are co-expressed in a linked manner across EEG and fMRI over individuals.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic plasticity is an important mechanism allowing adaptation to new environments and as such it has been suggested to facilitate biological invasions. Under this assumption, invasive populations are predicted to exhibit stronger plastic responses than native populations. Drosophila suzukii is an invasive species whose males harbor a spot on the wing tip. In this study, by manipulating developmental temperature, we compare the phenotypic plasticity of wing spot size of two invasive populations with that of a native population. We then compare the results with data obtained from wild-caught flies from different natural populations. While both wing size and spot size are plastic to temperature, no difference in plasticity was detected between native and invasive populations, rejecting the hypothesis of a role of the wing-spot plasticity in the invasion success. In contrast we observed a remarkable stability in the spot-to-wing ratio across temperatures, as well as among geographic populations. This stability suggests either that the spot relative size is under stabilizing selection, or that its variation might be constrained by a tight developmental correlation between spot size and wing size. Our data show that this correlation was lost at high temperature, leading to an increased variation in the relative spot size, particularly marked in the two invasive populations. This suggests (i) that D. suzukiis development is impaired by hot temperatures, in agreement with the cold-adapted status of this species; (ii) that the spot size can be decoupled from wing size, rejecting the hypothesis of an absolute constraint and suggesting that the wing color pattern might be under stabilizing (sexual) selection; (iii) that such sexual selection might be relaxed in the invasive populations. Finally, a subtle but consistent directional asymmetry in spot size was detected in favor of the right side in all populations and temperatures, possibly indicative of a lateralized sexual behavior.",

Although the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the hippocampus are implicated in the encoding of stressor controllability, the neural dynamics underlying this process are unknown. Here, we recorded CA1 and mPFC neural activities in rats during the exposure to controllable, uncontrollable, or no shocks, and investigated electrophysiological predictors of escape performance upon exposure to subsequent uncontrollable shocks. We were able to accurately discriminate stressed from non-stressed animals and predict resistant or helpless individuals based on neural oscillatory dynamics. We identified a pattern of enhanced CA1-mPFC theta power, synchrony, cross-frequency interaction, and neuronal coupling that strongly predicted learned resistance, and that was lacking in helpless individuals. Our findings suggest that hippocampal-prefrontal network theta activity supports cognitive mechanisms of stress coping, and its impairment may underlie vulnerability to stress-related disorders.",

    "abstract": "Forage grasses are mainly used in animal feed to fatten cattle and dairy herds. Among tropical forage crops that reproduce by seeds, guinea grass (Megathyrsus maximus) is considered one of the most productive. This species has several genomic complexities, such as autotetraploidy and apomixis, due to the process of domestication. Consequently, approaches that relate phenotypic and genotypic data are incipient. In this context, we built a linkage map with allele dosage and generated novel information about the genetic architecture of traits that are important for the breeding of M. maximus. From a full-sib progeny, a linkage map containing 858 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers with allele dosage information expected for an autotetraploid was obtained. The high genetic variability of the progeny allowed us to map ten quantitative trait loci (QTLs) related to agronomic traits, such as regrowth capacity and total dry matter, and 36 QTLs related to nutritional quality, which were distributed among all homology groups (HGs). Various overlapping regions associated with the quantitative traits suggested QTL hotspots. In addition, we were able to map one locus that controls apospory (apo-locus) in HG II. A total of 55 different gene families involved in cellular metabolism and plant growth were identified from markers adjacent to the QTLs and apomixis locus by using the Panicum virgatum genome as a reference in comparisons with the genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa. Our results provide a better understanding of the genetic basis of reproduction by apomixis and traits important for breeding programs that considerably influence animal productivity as well as the quality of meat and milk.",

    "abstract": "A synthetic lethal effect arises when a cancer-associated change introduces a unique vulnerability to cancer cells that makes them unusually susceptible to a drugs inhibitory activity. The synthetic lethal approach is attractive because it enables targeting of cancers harboring specific genomic alterations, the products of which may have proven refractory to direct targeting. An example is cancer driven by overexpression of MYC. Here, we conducted a high-content screen for compounds that are synthetic lethal to elevated MYC using a small-molecule library to identify compounds that are closely related to, or are themselves, regulatory-approved drugs. The screen identified dimethylfasudil, a potent and reversible inhibitor of Rho-associated kinases ROCK1 and ROCK2. Close analogs of dimethylfasudil are used clinically to treat neurologic and cardiovascular disorders. The synthetic lethal interaction was conserved in rodent and human cell lines and could be observed with activation of either MYC or its paralog MYCN. The synthetic lethality seems specific to MYC overexpressing cells as it could not be substituted by a variety of oncogenic manipulations and synthetic lethality was diminished by RNAi-mediated depletion of MYC in human cancer cell lines. Collectively, these data support investigation of the use of dimethylfasudil as a drug that is synthetic lethal for malignancies that specifically overexpress MYC.\\n\\nSignificance StatementSynthetic lethal targeting of tumors overexpressing MYC holds promise for attacking aggressive malignancies. Here we describe a synthetic lethal interaction between dimethylfasudil and overexpression of MYC. Uniquely, this novel synthetic lethal interaction points toward an opportunity for synthetic lethality with a molecule likely to harbor favorable drug-like properties that enable systemic use.",

    "abstract": "The Steinernema carpocapsae-Xenorhabdus nematophila association is a nematobacterial complex (NBC) used in biological control of insect crop pests. The ability of this dual pathogen to infest and kill an insect strongly depends on the dialogue between the hosts immune system and each partner of the complex. Even though this dialogue has been extensively studied from the two partners points of view in several insect models, still little is known about the structure and the molecular aspects of the insects immune response to the dual infection. Here, we used the lepidopteran pest Spodoptera frugiperda as a model to analyze the respective impact of each NBC partner in the spatiotemporal immune responses that are induced after infestation. To this aim, we first analyzed the expression variations of the insects immune genes in the fat bodies and hemocytes of infested larvae by using previously obtained RNAseq data. We then selected representative immune genes for RT-qPCR investigations of the temporal variations of their expressions after infestation and of their induction levels after independent injections of each partner. We found that the fat body and the hemocytes both produce potent and stable immune responses to the infestation by the NBC, which correspond to combinations of bacterium- and nematode-induced ones. Consistent with the nature of each pathogen, we showed that X. nematophila mainly induces genes classically involved in antibacterial responses, whereas S. carpocapsae is responsible for the induction of lectins and of genes expected to be involved in melanization and cellular encapsulation. In addition, we found that two clusters of unknown genes dramatically induced by the NBC also present partner-specific induction profiles, which paves the way for their functional characterization. Finally, we discuss putative relationships between the variations of the expression of some immune genes and the NBCs immunosuppressive strategies.\\n\\nAuthor summaryEntomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) are living in the soil and prey upon insect larvae. They enter the insect by the natural orifices, and reach the hemocoel through the intestinal epithelium. There, they release their symbiotic bacteria that will develop within the insect and eventually kill it. Nematodes can then feed and reproduce on the insect cadaver. By using transcriptomic approaches, we previously showed that Lepidoptera larvae (caterpillars of the fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda) produce a strong immune response in reaction to infestation by EPNs. However, we do not know if this immune reaction is triggered by the nematode itself -Steinernema carpacapsae - or its symbiotic bacteria - Xenorhabdus nematophila. To answer this question, we present in this work a careful annotation of immunity genes in S. frugiperda and surveyed their activation by quantitative PCR in reaction to an injection of the bacteria alone, the axenic nematode or the associated complex. We found that the immune genes are selectively activated by either the bacteria or the nematode and we discuss the implication of which pathway are involved in the defense against various pathogens. We also show that a cluster of newly discovered genes, present only in Lepidoptera, is activated by the nematode only and could represent nematicide genes.",

    "abstract": "Unlike other species, such as cattle, cats or humans, prion disease has never been described in dogs, even though they were similarly exposed to the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) agent. This resistance prompted a thorough analysis of the canine PRNP gene and the presence of a negatively charged amino acid residue in position 163 was readily identified as potentially fundamental as it differed from all known susceptible species. Furthermore, recent results from our group demonstrated that mouse PRNP with the dog substitution N158D (mouse equivalent to position 163) rendered mice resistant to prion infection. In the present study, a transgenic mouse model was generated expressing dog prion protein (with glutamic acid at position 163) and challenged intracerebrally with a panel of prion isolates (including cattle BSE, sheep scrapie, atypical sheep scrapie, atypical BSE-L, sheep-BSE and chronic wasting disease, among others) none of which could infect them. The brains of these mice were subjected to in vitro prion amplification and failed to find even minimal amounts of misfolded prions providing definitive experimental evidence that dogs are resistant to prion disease. Subsequently, a second transgenic model was generated in which aspartic acid in position 163 was substituted for asparagine (the most common amino acid in this position in prion susceptible species) and this mutation resulted in susceptibility to BSE-derived isolates.\\n\\nThese findings strongly support the hypothesis that the amino acid residue at position 163 of canine PrPC is a major determinant of the exceptional resistance of the canidae family to prion infection and establish this as a promising therapeutic target for prion diseases.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYCats, cattle, people and dogs were all exposed to mad cow disease but, unlike the other three, dogs never succumbed to the disease. We generated a mouse model expressing canine prion protein (instead of mouse prion protein) to provide experimental evidence that dogs are resistant to prion infection by challenging the mice with a panel of prion isolates. None of the prions could infect our transgenic mice that expressed dog prion protein. When the prion protein amino acid sequence of dogs was compared to that of other susceptible species, one amino acid in a specific position was found to be different to all the prion-susceptible animals. To determine if this amino acid was the one responsible for dogs resistance to prions, a second mouse model was generated with the canine prion protein but the critical amino acid was substituted for the one susceptible species have. When this model was challenged with the same panel of prions it could be infected with at least one of them. These results demonstrate the relevance of this amino acid position in determining susceptibility or resistance to prions, and this information can be used to design preventative treatments for prion diseases.",

    "abstract": "The rhizosphere, which is the region of soil adjacent to plant roots, is affected by the activities of both plant roots and associated microorganisms which cause changes in soil properties including nutrient mineral composition. Accordingly, the actual availability of plant nutrients may not be the same as that estimated on the basis of bulk soil analysis. However, the extent and manner in which the availability of plant nutrients in bulk and rhizosphere soils differ remain unclear. Therefore, the present study defined the rhizosphere as the soil adhered to plant roots, established a set of small-scale protocols for analyzing the nutrient minerals of small soil samples, and then characterized the rhizosphere soil of sorghum, Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench. The mineral contents of the bulk and rhizosphere soil differed significantly, with nutrient contents generally greater in the rhizosphere, and particularly remarkable accumulation was observed in regards to ammonium ion and exchangeable potassium concentrations. Such accumulation might be due, in part, to the greater per weight surface areas of rhizosphere soil particles, but other mechanisms, including the accumulation of organic matter, could also be involved.",
