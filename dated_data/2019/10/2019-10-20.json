    "abstract": "Aboveground plant efficiency has improved significantly in recent years, and the improvement has led to a steady increase in global food production. The improvement of belowground plant efficiency has potential to further increase food production. However, belowground plant roots are harder to study, due to inherent challenges presented by root phenotyping. Several tools for identifying root anatomical features in root cross-section images have been proposed. However, the existing tools are not fully automated and require significant human effort to produce accurate results. To address this limitation, we use a fully automated approach, specifically, the Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), to identify anatomical traits in root cross-section images. By training Faster R-CNN models on root cross-section images, we can detect objects such as root, stele and late metaxylem, and predict rectangular bounding boxes around such objects. Subsequently, the bounding boxes can be used to estimate the root diameter, stele diameter, late metaxylem number, and average diameter. Experimental evaluation using standard object detection metrics, such as intersection-over-union and mean average precision, has shown that the Faster R-CNN models trained on rice root cross-section images can accurately detect root, stele and late metaxylem objects. Furthermore, the results have shown that the measurements estimated based on predicted bounding boxes have small root mean square error when compared with the corresponding ground truth values, suggesting that Faster R-CNN can be used to accurately detect anatomical features. A webserver for performing root anatomy using the Faster R-CNN models trained on rice images is available at https://rootanatomy.org, together with a link to a GitHub repository that contains a copy of the Faster R-CNN code. The labeled images used for training and evaluating the Faster R-CNN models are also available from the GitHub repository.",

    "abstract": "Electroporation is the most feasible non-viral material delivery system for manipulating human T cells given its time- and cost-effectiveness. However, efficient delivery requires electroporation settings to be optimized for different devices, cellular states, and materials to be delivered. Here, we used electroporation to either induce exogenous gene expression in human primary T cells by plasmids or in vitro transcribed (IVT) mRNA and also target endogenous genes by Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). We characterized the electroporation conditions both for activated and unstimulated human T cells. Although naive cells are non-dividing and therefore their genetic manipulation is harder compared to activated T cells, we developed the technical ability to manipulate both naive and memory cells within the unstimulated T cell population by IVT mRNA and Cas9 RNP electroporation. Here, we outline the best practices for achieving highly-efficient genetic manipulation in primary T cells without causing significant cytotoxicity to the cells. Because there is increasing evidence for \\\"less-differentiated\\\" T cells to have better anti-tumor activity for immunotherapy, manipulating naive T cells with high efficiency is also of high importance to clinical applications and to study the biology of these cells.",

    "abstract": "Neural circuitry represents sensory input with patterns of spiking activity. Across brain regions, initial representations are transformed to ultimately drive adaptive behavior. In mammalian neocortex, visual information is processed by primary visual cortex (V1) and multiple higher visual areas (HVAs). The interconnections of these brain regions, over which transformations can occur, span millimeters or more. Shared variability in spiking responses between neurons, called \\\"noise correlations\\\" (NCs), can be due to shared input and/or direct or indirect connectivity. Thus, NCs provide insight into the functional connectivity of neuronal circuits. In this study, we used subcellular resolution, mesoscale field-of-view two-photon calcium imaging to systematically characterize the NCs for pairs of layer 2/3 neurons across V1 and four HVAs (areas LM, LI, AL and PM) of mice. The average NCs for pairs of neurons within or across cortical areas were orders of magnitude larger than trial-shuffled control values. We characterized the modulation of NCs by neuron distance, tuning similarity, receptive field overlap, and stimulus type over millimeter scale distances in mouse visual cortex, within and across V1 and multiple HVAs. NCs were positively correlated with shared tuning and receptive field overlap, even across cortical areas and millimeter length scales. We compared the structure of these NCs to that of hypothetical networks to determine what network types can account for the results. We found that to reproduce the NC networks, neuron connectivity was regulated by both feature similarities and hub mechanism. Overall, these results revealed principles for the functional organization and correlation structure at the individual neuron level across multiple cortical areas, which can inform and constrain computational theories of cortical networks.",

    "abstract": "Particle filtering is a contemporary Sequential Monte Carlo state inference and identification methodology that allows filtering of general non-Gaussian and non-linear models in light of time series of empirical observations. Several previous lines of research have demonstrated the capacity to effectively apply particle filtering to low-dimensional compartmental transmission models. We demonstrate here implementation and evaluation of particle filtering to more complex compartmental transmission models for pertussis - including application with models involving 1, 2, and 32 age groups and with two distinct functional forms for contact matrices - using over 35 years of monthly and annual pre-vaccination provincial data from the mid-western Canadian province. Following evaluation of the predictive accuracy of these four particle filtering models, we then performed prediction, intervention experiments and outbreak classification analysis based on the most accurate model. Using that model, we contribute the first full-paper description of particle filter-informed intervention evaluation in health. We conclude that applying particle filtering with relatively high-dimensional pertussis transmission models, and incorporating time series of reported counts, can serve as a valuable technique to assist public health authorities in predicting pertussis outbreak evolution and classify whether there will be an outbreak or not in the next month (Area under the ROC Curve of 0.9) in the context of even aggregate monthly incoming empirical data. Within this use, the particle filtering models can moreover perform counterfactual analysis of interventions to assist the public health authorities in intervention planning. With its grounding in an understanding of disease mechanisms and a representation of the latent state of the system, when compared with other emerging applications of artificial intelligence techniques in outbreak projection, this technique further offers the advantages of high explanatory value and support for investigation of counterfactual scenarios.",

    "abstract": "We recently reported the existence of fluctuations in neural signals that may permit neurons to code multiple simultaneous stimuli sequentially across time1. This required deploying a novel statistical approach to permit investigation of neural activity at the scale of individual trials. Here we present tests using synthetic data to assess the sensitivity and specificity of this analysis. We fabricated datasets to match each of several potential response patterns derived from single-stimulus response distributions. In particular, we simulated dual stimulus trial spike counts that reflected fluctuating mixtures of the single stimulus spike counts, stable intermediate averages, single stimulus winner-take-all, or response distributions that were outside the range defined by the single stimulus responses (such as summation or suppression). We then assessed how well the analysis recovered the correct response pattern as a function of the number of simulated trials and the difference between the simulated responses to each \\\"stimulus\\\" alone. We found excellent recovery of the mixture, intermediate, and outside categories (>97% correct), and good recovery of the single/winner-take-all category (>90% correct) when the number of trials was >20 and the single-stimulus response rates were 50Hz and 20Hz respectively. Both larger numbers of trials and greater separation between the single stimulus firing rates improved categorization accuracy. These results provide a benchmark, and guidelines for data collection, for use of this method to investigate coding of multiple items at the individual-trial time scale.",

Based on morphological characteristics, the most commonly-utilized fine fescues are divided into five taxa: three are subspecies within F. rubra L. and the remaining two are treated as species within the F. ovina L. complex. Morphologically, these five taxa are very similar, both identification and classification of fine fescues remain challenging. In an effort to develop identification methods for fescues, we used flow cytometry to estimate genome size, ploidy level, and sequenced the chloroplast genome of all five taxa. Fine fescue chloroplast genome sizes ranged from 133,331 to 133,841 bp and contained 113 to 114 genes. Phylogenetic relationship reconstruction using whole chloroplast genome sequences agreed with previous work based on morphology. Comparative genomics suggested unique repeat signatures for each fine fescue taxon that could potentially be used for marker development for taxon identification.",

    "abstract": "Nucleotide variants can cause functional changes by altering protein-RNA binding in various ways that are not easy to predict. This can affect processes such as splicing, nuclear shuttling, and stability of the transcript. Therefore, correct modelling of protein-RNA binding is critical when predicting the effects of sequence variations. Many RNA-binding proteins recognize a diverse set of motifs and binding is typically also dependent on the genomic context, making this task particularly challenging. Here, we present DeepCLIP, the first method for context-aware modeling and predicting protein binding to nucleic acids using exclusively sequence data as input. We show that DeepCLIP outperforms existing methods for modelling RNA-protein binding. Importantly, we demonstrate that DeepCLIP is able to reliably predict the functional effects of contextually dependent nucleotide variants in independent wet lab experiments. Furthermore, we show how DeepCLIP binding profiles can be used in the design of therapeutically relevant antisense oligonucleotides, and to uncover possible position-dependent regulation in a tissue-specific manner.

    "abstract": "Protein functions can be described by the Gene Ontology (GO) terms, allowing us to compare the functions of two proteins by measuring the similarity of the terms assigned to them. Recent works have applied neural network models to derive the vector representations for GO terms and compute similarity scores for these terms by comparing their vector embeddings. There are two typical ways to embed GO terms into vectors; a model can either embed the definitions of the terms or the topology of the terms in the ontology. In this paper, we design three tasks to critically evaluate the GO embeddings of two recent neural network models, and further introduce additional models for embedding GO terms, adapted from three popular neural network frameworks: Graph Convolution Network (GCN), Embeddings from Language Models (ELMo), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), which have not yet been explored in previous works. Task 1 studies edge cases where the GO embeddings may not provide meaningful similarity scores for GO terms. We find that all neural network based methods fail to produce high similarity scores for related terms when these terms have low Information Content values. Task 2 is a canonical task which estimates how well GO embeddings can compare functions of two orthologous genes or two interacting proteins. The best neural network methods for this task are those that embed GO terms using their definitions, and the differences among such methods are small. Task 3 evaluates how GO embeddings affect the performance of GO annotation methods, which predict whether a protein should be labeled by certain GO terms. When the annotation datasets contain many samples for each GO label, GO embeddings do not improve the classification accuracy. Machine learning GO annotation methods often remove rare GO labels from the training datasets so that the model parameters can be efficiently trained. We evaluate whether GO embeddings can improve prediction of rare labels unseen in the training datasets, and find that GO embeddings based on the BERT framework achieve the best results in this setting. We present our embedding methods and three evaluation tasks as the basis for future research on this topic.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative analyses of morphological variation using geometric morphometrics are often performed on 2D photos of 3D structures. It is generally assumed that the error due to the flattening of the third dimension is negligible. However, despite hundreds of 2D studies, few have actually tested this assumption and none has done it on large animals, such as those typically classified as megafauna. We explore this issue in living equids, focusing on ventral cranial variation at both micro- and macro-evolutionary levels. By comparing 2D and 3D data, we found that size is well approximated, whereas shape is more strongly impacted by 2D inaccuracies, as it is especially evident in intra-specific analyses. The 2D approximation improves when shape differences are larger, as in macroevolution, but even at this level precise inter-individual similarity relationships are altered. Despite this, main patterns of sex, species and allometric variation in 2D were the same as in 3D, thus suggesting that 2D may be a source of  noise that does not mask the main signal in the data. However, the problem is complex and any generalization premature. Morphometricians should therefore test the appropriateness of 2D using preliminary investigations in relation to the specific study questions in their own samples. We discuss whether this might be feasible using a reduced landmark configuration and smaller samples, which would save time and money. In an exploratory analysis, we found that in equids results seem robust to sampling, but become less precise and, with fewer landmarks, may slightly overestimate 2D inaccuracies.",

Three genome-wide significant loci were identified on chromosomes 1, 7, and 11. A GWAS meta-analysis including a Chinese cohort supported the locus on chromosome 11 to be a strong risk locus for ADHD+DBDs across European and Chinese ancestries (rs7118422, P=3.15x10-10, OR=1.17). This locus was not associated with ADHD without DBDs in a secondary GWAS of 13,583 ADHD cases and 22,314 controls, suggesting that the locus is a specific risk locus for the comorbid phenotype.\\n\\nWe found a higher SNP heritability for ADHD+DBDs (h2SNP =0.34) when compared to ADHD without DBDs (h2SNP =0.20). Genetic correlations of ADHD+DBDs with aggressive (rg =0.81) and anti-social behaviors (rg=0.82) were high, and polygenic risk score analyses revealed a significant increased burden of variants associated with ADHD and aggression in individuals with ADHD+DBDs compared to ADHD without DBDs. Our results suggests that ADHD+DBDs represent a more severe phenotype with respect to the genetic risk load than ADHD without DBDs, in line with previous studies, and that the risk load to some extent can be explained by variants associated with aggressive behavior.",

    "abstract": "The ventral visual pathway is crucially involved in integrating low-level visual features into complex representations for objects and scenes. At an intermediate stage of the ventral visual pathway, V4 plays a crucial role in supporting this transformation. Many V4 neurons are selective for shape segments like curves and corners, however it remains unclear whether these neurons are organized into clustered functional domains, a structural motif common across other visual cortices. Using two-photon calcium imaging in awake macaques, we confirmed and localized cortical domains selective for curves or corners in V4. Single-cell resolution imaging confirmed that curve or corner selective neurons were spatially clustered into such domains. When tested with hexagonal-segment stimuli, we find that stimulus smoothness is the cardinal difference between curve and corner selectivity in V4. Combining cortical population responses with single neuron analysis, our results reveal that curves and corners are encoded by neurons clustered into functional domains in V4. This functionally-specific population architecture bridges the gap between the early and late cortices of the ventral pathway and may serve to facilitate complex object recognition.",

    "abstract": "Off-target cleavage by Cas9 can confound measurements of cell proliferation/viability in CRISPR assays by eliciting a DNA-damage response that includes cell cycle arrest1-3. This gene-independent toxicity has been documented in large scale assays2-4 and shown to be a source of false-positives when libraries are populated by promiscuous guide RNAs (gRNAs)7. To address this, we developed CSC, a computational method to correct for the effect of specificity on gRNA depletion. We applied CSC to screening data from the Cancer Dependency Map and show that it significantly improves the specificity of CRISPR-Cas9 essentiality screens while preserving known gene essentialities even for genes targeted by highly pro-miscuous guides. We packaged CSC in a Python software to allow its seamless integration into current CRISPR analysis pipelines and improve the sensitivity of essentiality screens for repetitive genomic loci.",

    "abstract": "The inheritance of the midbody remnant (MBR) breaks the symmetry of the two daughter cells, with functional consequences for lumen and primary cilium formation by polarized epithelial cells, and also for development and differentiation. However, despite their importance, neither the relationship between the plasma membrane and the inherited MBR nor the mechanism of MBR inheritance is well known. Here, the analysis by correlative light and ultra-high-resolution scanning electron microscopy reveals a membranous stalk that physically connects the MBR to the apical membrane of epithelial cells. The stalk, which derives from the uncleaved side of the midbody, concentrates the ESCRT machinery. The ESCRT CHMP4C subunit enables MBR inheritance, and its depletion dramatically reduces the percentage of ciliated cells. We demonstrate: (1) that MBRs are physically connected to the plasma membrane, (2) how CHMP4C helps maintain the integrity of the connection, and (3) the functional importance of the connection.",

    "abstract": "Phospholipid metabolism is crucial for membrane dynamics in malaria parasites during entire cycle in the host cell. Plasmodium falciparum harbours several members of phospholipase family, which play key role in phospholipid metabolism. Here we have functionally characterized a parasite lysophospholipase (PfLPL1) with a view to understand its role in lipid homeostasis. We used a regulated fluorescence affinity tagging, which allowed endogenous localization and transient knock-down of the protein. PffLPL1localizes to dynamic vesicular structures that traffic from parasite periphery, through the cytosol to get associated as a multi-vesicular neutral lipid rich body next to the food-vacuole during blood stages. Down-regulation of the PfLPL1 disrupted parasite lipid-homeostasis leading to significant reduction of neutral lipids in lipid-bodies. This hindered conversion of heme to hemozoin, leading to food-vacuole abnormalities, which in turn disrupted parasite development cycle and significantly inhibited parasite growth. Detailed lipidomic analyses of inducible knock-down parasites confirmed role of PfLPL1 in generation of neutral lipid through recycling of phospholipids. Our study thus suggests a specific role of PfLPL1 to generate neutral lipids in the parasite, which are essential for parasite survival.\\n\\nImportancePresent study was undertaken with a view to understand the functional role of a unique lipase (lysophopholipase, PfLPL1) of the human malaria parasite. We utilized genetic approaches for GFP tagging as well as to knock-down the target protein in the parasite. Our studies showed that PfLPL1 associates closely with the lysosome like organelle in the parasite, the food-vacuole. During the blood stage parasite cycle, the food-vacuole is involved in degradation of host haemoglobin and conversion of heme to hemozoin. Genetic knock-down approaches and detailed lipidomic studies confirmed that PfLPL1 protein plays key role in generation of neutral lipid stores in the parasite; neutral lipids are essentially required for hemozoin formation in the parasite, a vital function of the food-vacuole. Overall, this study identified specific role of PfLPL1 in the parasite which is essential for parasite survival.",

    "abstract": "Scratch assays are routinely used to study collective cell behaviour in vitro. Typical experimental protocols do not vary the initial density of cells, and typical mathematical modelling approaches describe cell motility and proliferation based on assumptions of linear diffusion and logistic growth. Jin et al. (2016) find that the behaviour of cells in scratch assays is density-dependent, and show that standard modelling approaches cannot simultaneously describe data initiated across a range of initial densities. To address this limitation, we calibrate an individual based model to scratch assay data across a large range of initial densities. Our model allows proliferation, motility, and a direction bias to depend on interactions between neighbouring cells. By considering a hierarchy of models where we systematically and sequentially remove interactions, we perform model selection analysis to identify the minimum interactions required for the model to simultaneously describe data across all initial densities. The calibrated model is able to match the experimental data across all densities using a single parameter distribution, and captures details about the spatial structure of cells. Our results provide strong evidence to suggest that motility is density-dependent in these experiments. On the other hand, we do not see the effect of crowding on proliferation in these experiments. These results are significant as they are precisely the opposite of the assumptions in standard continuum models, such as the Fisher-Kolmogorov equation and its generalisations.",

    "abstract": "In contrast to the canonical picture of transport by direct attachment to motor proteins, recent evidence shows that a number of intracellular  cargos navigate the cytoplasm by hitchhiking on motor-driven  carrier organelles. We describe a quantitative model of intracellular cargo transport via hitchhiking, examining the efficiency of hitchhiking initiation as a function of geometric and mechanical parameters. We focus specifically on the parameter regime relevant to the hitchhiking motion of peroxisome organelles in fungal hyphae. Our work predicts the dependence of transport initiation rates on the distribution of cytoskeletal tracks and carrier organelles, as well as the number, length and flexibility of the linker proteins that mediate contact between the carrier and the hitchhiking cargo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that attaching organelles to microtubules can result in a substantial enhancement of the hitchhiking initiation rate in tubular geometries such as those found in fungal hyphae. This enhancement is expected to increase the overall transport rate of hitchhiking organelles, and lead to greater efficiency in organelle dispersion. Our results leverage a quantitative physical model to highlight the importance of organelle encounter dynamics in non-canonical intracellular transport.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEA variety of cellular components are transported via hitchhiking by attaching to other motile organelles. Defects in the molecular machinery responsible for organelle hitchhiking may be linked with neurodegenerative disorders. To date, no comprehensive physical models of this non-canonical mode of transport have been developed. In particular, the connection between molecular- and organelle-scale properties of hitchhiking components and their effect on cellular-scale transport has remained unclear. Here, we investigate the mechanics of hitchhiking initiation and explore organelle interactions that can modulate the efficiency of this process.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium species are apicomplexan parasites whose zoites are polarized cells with a marked apical organisation where the organelles associated with host cell invasion and colonization reside. Plasmodium gametes mate in the mosquito midgut to form the spherical and presumed apolar zygote that morphs during the following 24 hours into a polarized, elongated and motile zoite form, the ookinete. Endocytosis-mediated protein transport is generally necessary for the establishment and maintenance of polarity in epithelial cells and neurons, and the small GTPase RAB11A is an important regulator of protein transport via recycling endosomes. PbRAB11A is essential in blood stage asexual of Plasmodium. Therefore, a promoter swap strategy was employed to down-regulate PbRAB11A expression in gametocytes and zygotes of the rodent malaria parasite, Plasmodium berghei which demonstrated the essential role of RAB11A in ookinete development. The approach revealed that lack of PbRAB11A had no effect on gamete production and fertility rates however, the zygote to ookinete transition was almost totally inhibited and transmission through the mosquito was prevented. Lack of PbRAB11A did not prevent meiosis and mitosis, nor the establishment of polarity as indicated by the correct formation and positioning of the Inner Membrane Complex (IMC) and apical complex. However, morphological maturation was prevented and parasites remained spherical and immotile and furthermore, they were impaired in the secretion and distribution of microneme cargo. The data are consistent with the previously proposed model of RAB11A endosome mediated delivery of plasma membrane in Toxoplasma gondii if not its role in IMC formation and implicate it in microneme function.\n\nAuthor SummaryAccording to the WHO there was estimated to be over 200 million cases of malaria in 2017 and nearly half a million deaths. The disease is caused by specific species of Plasmodium which are passed between human hosts by a mosquito vector. In order to transmit through the mosquito the single-celled parasite undergoes many developmental changes as it morphs from non-motile blood forms to become a polarised and motile ookinete in the mosquito midgut. Transport of proteins within the cell during these critical morphological transitions relies on specific endosome vesicles to correctly target proteins within the parasite. We investigated the role of the RAB11A protein which is known to be involved in endosomal vesicle targeting to generate cellular polarity in other organisms. Because RAB11A is also essential for parasite growth in the mammalian host we used a promoter swap system to specifically switch off RAB11A in the sexual transmission stages. In the absence of RAB11A parasites were unable to form elongated, motile ookinetes and were unable to pass through the mosquito. Interestingly the parasites were able to form some of the (polarising) structures specific to ookinetes however full morphological transformation did not occur and the parasites were not motile. We show that although proteins are still delivered to the parasite surface, secretion is impaired and that the mutant parasites are smaller despite obvious microtubule formation implying that there is a deficit in delivery of membrane to the surface.",

    "abstract": "The oncogenic tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL activates a variety of signaling pathways and plays a causative role in the pathogenesis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML); however, the subcellular distribution of this chimeric protein remains controversial. Here, we report that BCR-ABL is localized to stress granules and that its granular localization contributes to BCR-ABL-dependent leukemogenesis. BCR-ABL-positive granules were not colocalized with any markers for membrane-bound organelles but were colocalized with HSP90a, a component of RNA granules. The number of such granules increased with thapsigargin treatment, confirming that the granules were stress granules. Given that treatment with the ABL kinase inhibitor imatinib and elimination of the N-terminal region of BCR-ABL abolished granule formation, kinase activity and the coiled-coil domain are required for granule formation. Whereas wild-type BCR-ABL rescued the growth defect in IL-3-depleted Ba/F3 cells, mutant BCR-ABL lacking the N-terminal region failed to do so. Moreover, forced tetramerization of the N-terminus-deleted mutant could not restore the growth defect, indicating that granule formation, but not tetramerization, through its N-terminus is critical for BCR-ABL-dependent oncogenicity. Our findings together provide new insights into the pathogenesis of CML by BCR-ABL and open a window for developing novel therapeutic strategies for this disease.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical forces are critical for the emergence of diverse three-dimensional morphologies of multicellular systems. However, it remains unclear what kind of mechanical parameters at cellular level substantially contribute to tissue morphologies. This is largely due to technical limitations of live measurements of cellular forces. Here we developed a framework for inferring and modeling mechanical forces of cell-cell interactions. First, by analogy to coarse-grained models in molecular and colloidal sciences, we approximated cells as particles, where mean forces (i.e. effective forces) of pairwise cell-cell interactions are considered. Then, the forces were statistically inferred by fitting the mathematical model to cell tracking data. This method was validated by using synthetic cell tracking data resembling various in vivo situations. Application of our method to the cells in the early embryos of mice and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans revealed that cell-cell interaction forces can be written as a pairwise potential energy in a manner dependent on cell-cell distances. Importantly, the profiles of the pairwise potentials were quantitatively different among species and embryonic stages, and the quantitative differences correctly described the differences of their morphological features such as spherical vs. distorted cell aggregates, and tightly vs. non-tightly assembled aggregates. We conclude that the effective pairwise potential of cell-cell interactions is a live measurable parameter whose quantitative differences can be a parameter describing three-dimensional tissue morphologies.\n\nAuthor summaryEmergence of diverse three-dimensional morphologies of multicellular organisms is one of the most intriguing phenomena in nature. Due to the complex situations in living systems (e.g. a lot of genes are involved in morphogenesis.), a model for describing the emergent properties of multicellular systems has not been established. To approach this issue, approximation of the complex situations to limited numbers of parameters is required. Here, we searched for mechanical parameters for describing morphologies. We developed a statistical method for inferring mechanical potential energy of cell-cell interactions in three-dimensional tissues; the mechanical potential is an approximation of various mechanical components such as cell-cell adhesive forces, cell surface tensions, etc. Then, we showed that the quantitative differences in the potential is sufficient to reproduce basic three-dimensional morphologies observed during the mouse and C. elegans early embryogenesis, revealing a direct link between cellular level mechanical parameters and three-dimensional morphologies. Our framework provides a noninvasive tool for measuring spatiotemporal cellular forces, which would be useful for studying morphogenesis of larger tissues including organs and their regenerative therapy.",

We further combine it with an imaging-based cell cycle staging to correlate nuclear architecture with gene expression across the cell cycle. We present this in the context of Cyclin A2 (CCNA2) gene for its known cell cycle-dependent expression.

    "abstract": "Tar DNA binding protein (TDP-43) has emerged as a key player in many neurodegenerative pathologies including frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotropic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Important hallmarks of FTLD and ALS are the toxic cytoplasmic inclusions of C-terminal fragments of TDP-43 (TDP-43CTD), which are formed upon proteolytic cleavage of full-length TDP-43 in the nucleus and subsequent transport to the cytoplasm. TDP-43CTD is also known to form stress granules (SGs) by coacervating with RNA in cytoplasm under stress conditions and are believed to be involved in modulating the pathologies. Among other factors affecting these pathologies, the pleiotropic protein called progranulin (PGRN) has gained significant attention lately. The haploinsufficiency of PGRN, caused by autosomal dominant mutations in GRN gene, results in its loss-of-function linked to FTLD and ALS. But precisely how the protein contributes to the pathology remains unknown. Recently, cleavage to GRNs were observed to be a significant part of FTLD and ALS progression with specific GRNs exacerbating TDP-43-induced toxicity in C.elegans. In this report, we show that GRNs -3 and -5 directly interact with TDP-43CTD to modulate latters aggregation or stress granule formation in disparate ways in vitro. These results constitute the first observation of direct interaction between GRNs and TDP-43 and suggest a mechanism by which the loss of PGRN function could lead to FTLD and ALS.",

Inhibition of Pp1 causes border cells to round up, dissociate, and move as single cells with altered motility. We present evidence that Pp1 promotes proper levels of cadherin-catenin complex proteins at cell-cell junctions within the cluster to keep border cells together. Pp1 further restricts actomyosin contractility to the cluster periphery rather than at internal cell-cell contacts. We show that the myosin phosphatase Pp1 complex, which inhibits non-muscle myosin-II (Myo-II) activity, coordinates border cell shape and cluster cohesion.

    "abstract": "Single cell technologies have rapidly generated an unprecedented amount of data that enables us to understand biological systems at single-cell resolution. However, joint analysis of datasets generated by independent labs remains challenging due to a lack of consistent terminology to describe cell types. Here, we present OnClass, an algorithm and accompanying software for automatically classifying cells into cell types part of the controlled vocabulary that forms the Cell Ontology. A key advantage of OnClass is its capability to classify cells into cell types not present in the training data because it uses the Cell Ontology graph to infer cell type relationships. Furthermore, OnClass can be used to identify marker genes for all the cell ontology categories, independently of whether the cells types are present or absent in the training data, suggesting that OnClass can be used not only as an annotation tool for single cell datasets but also as an algorithm to identify marker genes specific to each term of the Cell Ontology, offering the possibility of refining the Cell Ontology using a data-centric approach.",
