    "abstract": "The left and right rodent hippocampi exhibit striking lateralization in some of the very neural substrates considered to be critical for hippocampal cognitive function. Despite this, there is an overwhelming lack of consideration for hemispheric differences in studies of the rodent hippocampus. Asymmetries identified so far suggest that a bilateral model of the hippocampus will be essential for an understanding of this brain region, and perhaps of the brain more widely. Although hypotheses have been proposed to explain how the left and right hippocampi contribute to behavior and cognition, these hypotheses have either been refuted by more recent studies or have been limited in the scope of data they explain. Here, I will first review data on human and rodent hippocampal lateralization. The implications of these data suggest that considering the hippocampus as a bilateral structure with functional lateralization will be critical moving forward in understanding the function and mechanisms of this brain region. In exploring these implications, I will then propose a hypothesis of the hippocampus as a bilateral structure. This discrete-continuous (DC) hypothesis proposes that the left and right hippocampi contribute to spatial memory and navigation in a complementary manner. Specifically, the left hemisphere stores spatial information as discrete, salient locations and that the right hemisphere represents space continuously, contributing to route computation and flexible spatial navigation. Consideration of hippocampal lateralization in designing future studies may provide insight into the function of the hippocampus and resolve debates concerning its function.",

    "abstract": "The BRCA2 tumor suppressor protein is involved in the maintenance of genome integrity through its role in homologous recombination. In mitosis, BRCA2 is phosphorylated by Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1). Here we describe how this phosphorylation contributes to the control of mitosis. We identified two highly conserved phosphorylation sites at S193 and T207 of BRCA2. Phosphorylated-T207 is a bona fide docking site for PLK1 as illustrated by the crystal structure of the BRCA2 peptide bound to PLK1 Polo-box domain. We found that BRCA2 bound to PLK1 forms a complex with the phosphatase PP2A and phosphorylated-BUBR1. Reducing BRCA2 binding to PLK1, as observed in BRCA2 breast cancer variants S206C and T207A, alters the tetrameric complex resulting in misaligned chromosomes, faulty chromosome segregation and aneuploidy. We thus reveal a direct role of BRCA2 in the alignment of chromosomes, distinct from its DNA repair function, with important consequences on chromosome stability. These findings may explain in part the aneuploidy observed in BRCA2-mutated tumors.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological surveillance for important wildlife diseases often relies on samples obtained from hunter-harvested animals. A problem, however, is that although convenient and cost-effective, hunter-harvest samples are not representative of the population due to heterogeneities in disease distribution and biased sampling. We developed an agent-based modeling framework that i) simulates a deer population in a user-generated landscape, and ii) uses a snapshot of the in silico deer population to simulate disease prevalence and distribution, harvest effort and sampling as per user-specified parameters. This framework can incorporate real-world heterogeneities in disease distribution, hunter harvest and harvest-based sampling, and therefore can be useful in informing wildlife disease surveillance strategies, specifically to determine population-specific sample sizes necessary for prompt detection of disease. Application of this framework is illustrated using the example of chronic wasting disease (CWD) surveillance in Missouris white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) population. We show how confidence in detecting CWD is grossly overestimated under the unrealistic, but standard, assumptions that sampling effort and disease are randomly and independently distributed. We then provide adjusted sample size recommendations based on more realistic assumptions. These models can be readily adapted to other regions as well as other wildlife disease systems.",

Subsets of cardiac and pharyngeal/head muscles share a common origin in the cardiopharyngeal mesoderm, but the chromatin landscapes that govern multipotent progenitors competence and early fate choices remain largely elusive. Here, we leveraged the simplicity of the chordate model Ciona to profile chromatin accessibility through stereotyped transitions from naive Mesp+ mesoderm to distinct fate-restricted heart and pharyngeal muscle precursors. An FGF-Foxf pathway acts in multipotent progenitors to establish cardiopharyngeal-specific patterns of accessibility, which govern later heart vs. pharyngeal muscle-specific expression profiles, demonstrating extensive spatiotemporal decoupling between early cardiopharyngeal enhancer accessibility and late cell-type-specific activity. Combinations of cis-regulatory elements with distinct chromatin accessibility profiles are required to activate of Ebf and Tbx1/10, two key determinants of cardiopharyngeal fate choices. We propose that this higher order combinatorial logic increases the repertoire of regulatory inputs that control gene expression, through either accessibility and/or activity, thus fostering spatially and temporally accurate fate choices.",

    "abstract": "Errors in gene transcription can be costly, and organisms have evolved to prevent their occurrence or mitigate their costs. The simplest interpretation of the drift barrier hypothesis suggests that species with larger population sizes would have lower transcriptional error rates. However, Escherichia coli seems to have a higher transcriptional error rate than species with lower effective population sizes, e.g. Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This could be explained if selection in E. coli were strong enough to maintain adaptations that mitigate the consequences of transcriptional errors through robustness, on a gene by gene basis, obviating the need for low transcriptional error rates and associated costs of global proofreading. Here we note that if selection is powerful enough to evolve local robustness, selection should also be powerful enough to locally reduce error rates. We therefore predict that transcriptional error rates will be lower in highly abundant proteins on which selection is strongest. However, we only expect this result when error rates are high enough to significantly impact fitness. As expected, we find such a relationship between expression and transcriptional error rate for non CU errors in E. coli (especially GA), but not in S. cerevisiae. We do not find this pattern for CU changes in E. coli, presumably because most deamination events occurred during sample preparation, but do for CU changes in S. cerevisiae, supporting the interpretation that CU error rates estimated with an improved protocol, and which occur at rates comparable to E. coli non CU errors, are biological.",

During locomotion, theta sequences encode sweeps in position starting slightly behind the animal and ending ahead of it. During quiescence and slow wave sleep, bouts of synchronized activity represent long trajectories called replays, which are well-established in place cells and have been recently reported in grid cells. Theta sequences and replay are hypothesized to facilitate many cognitive functions, but their underlying mechanisms are unknown. A leading mechanism proposed for grid cell formation is the continuous attractor network. We demonstrate that this established architecture naturally produces theta sequences and replay as distinct consequences of modulating external input. Driving inhibitory interneurons at the theta frequency causes attractor bumps to oscillate in speed and size, which gives rise to theta sequences and phase precession, respectively. Decreasing input drive to all neurons produces traveling wavefronts of activity that are decoded as replays.",

    "abstract": "Adaptation is often described in behavioral ecology as individuals maximizing their inclusive fitness. Under what conditions does this hold and how does this relate to the gene-centered perspective of adaptation? We unify and extend the literature on these questions to class-structured populations. We demonstrate that the maximization (in the best-response sense) of class-specific inclusive fitness obtains in uninvadable population states (meaning that all deviating mutant go extinct). This defines a genuine actor-centered perspective on adaptation. But this inclusive fitness is assigned to all bearers of a mutant allele in a given class and depends on distributions of demographic and genetic contexts. These distributions, in turn, usually depend on events in previous generations and are thus not under individual control. This prevents, in general, from envisioning individuals themselves as autonomous fitness-maximizers, each with its own inclusive fitness. For weak selection, however, the dependence on earlier events can be neglected. We then show that each individual in each class appears to maximize its own inclusive fitness when all other individuals exhibit fitness-maximizing behavior. This defines a genuine individual-centered perspective of adaptation and justifies formally, as a first-order approximation, the long-heralded view of individuals appearing to maximize their own inclusive fitness.",

    "abstract": "Chlordecone (C10Cl10O) is a bishomocubane molecule, that has been used as pesticide, in many countries in Europe, America, and Africa, from the 1960s to 1990s. In the French West Indies, the historic use of chlordecone to control banana weevil infestations has resulted in pollution of large land areas. Although currently banned, chlordecone persists because it adsorbs strongly to soil and its complex structure is stable, particularly under aerobic conditions. A leaching model established that CLD pollution will last in French west indies soils several decades to half a millennium depending on soil type. However, abiotic chemical transformation catalyzed by reduced vitamin B12 has been shown to break down chlordecone by opening the cage structure to produce C9 polychloroindenes, and more recently these C9 polychloroindenes were also observed as products of anaerobic microbiological transformation by Citrobacter. To assess the potential for bioremediation, the anaerobic biotransformation of chlordecone by microbes native to soils from the French West Indies was investigated. Anaerobic microcosms were constructed from chlordecone impacted Guadeloupe soil and sludge to mimic natural attenuation and eletron donor-stimulated reductive dechlorination. Original microcosms and transfers were incubated over a period of 8 years, during which they were repeatedly amended with chlordecone and electron donor (ethanol and acetone). Using LC/MS, chlordecone and degradation products were detected in all the biologically active microcosms. Observed products in active incubations included monohydro-, dihydro- and trihydrochlordecone derivatives (C10Cl10-nO2Hn, n= 1,2,3), as well as \\\"open cage\\\" C9 polychloroindene compounds (C9Cl5-nH3+n, n=0,1,2) and C10 carboxylated polychloroindene derivatives (C10Cl4-nO2H4+n, n=0-3). Products with as many as 9 chlorine atoms removed were detected. These products were not observed in sterile incubations. Chlordecone concentrations decreased in active microcosms as concentrations of products increased, indicating that anaerobic dechlorination processes have occurred. An crude estimation of partitioning coefficients between soil and water showed that carboxylated intermediates sorb poorly, and as a consequence may be flushed away while polychlorinated indenes sorb strongly to soil. Microbial community analysis in microcosms showed enrichment of anaerobic fermenting and acetogenic microbes possibly involved in anaerobic chlordecone biotransformation. It thus should be possible to stimuilate anaerobic dechlorination through donor amendment to contaminated soils, particularly as some metabolites (in particular pentachloroindene) were already detected in field samples as a result of intrinsic processes. Extensive dechlorination in the microcosms, with evidence for up to 9 Cl atoms removed from the parent molecule is game-changing, giving hope to the possibility of using bioremediation to reduce the impact of CLD contamination.",

Thus, a better understanding of risk factors for developing EOC is crucial for earlier screening and detection to improve survival. To that effort, there have been suggestions that there is an association of schizophrenia and cancer, possibly because metabolic changes are a hallmark of both cancer and schizophrenia (SZ). Perturbed choline metabolism has been documented in both diseases. Our objective was to use Mendelian randomization to evaluate whether SZ increased risk for developing EOC or the converse, and, whether SZ impacted glycerophosphocholine (GPC) metabolites. We found that SZ conferred a weak but increased risk for EOC, but not the reverse (no evidence that EOC caused SZ). SZ was also causally associated with lower levels of two GPC species and with suggestively lower levels in an additional three GPCs. We postulate that perturbed choline metabolism in SZ may mimic or contribute to a \\\"cholinic\\\" phenotype, as observed in EOC cells.",

Pyramidal neurons change the surface expression of NMDA receptors, whereas astrocytes change their proximity to synapses. Together, these phenomena alter glutamate clearance, receptor activation and integration of temporally clustered excitatory synaptic inputs, ultimately shaping hippocampal-dependent learning in vivo.

As exceptions to Mendels law are known to occur, one can investigate why non-Mendelian segregation is not more common using modifier theory. Earlier work assuming sex-independent modifier effects in a random mating population with heterozygote advantage concluded that equal segregation is stable over long-term evolution. Subsequent investigation, however, demonstrated that the stability of the Mendelian scheme disappears when sex-specific modifier effects are allowed. Here I derive invasion conditions favoring the repeal of Mendelian law in mixed and obligate selfing populations. Oppositely-directed segregation distortion in the production of male and female gametes is selected for in the presence of overdominant fitness. The conditions are less restrictive than under panmixia in that strong selection can occur even without differential viability of reciprocal heterozygotes (i.e. in the absence of parent-of-origin effects at the overdominant fitness locus). Generalized equilibria are derived for full selfing.",

    "abstract": "Macrophages are a key and heterogenous class of phagocytic cells of the innate immune system, which act as sentinels in peripheral tissues and are mobilized during infection. Macrophage activation in the presence of bacterial cells and molecules entails specific and complex programs of gene expression. How such triggers elicit the gene expression programs is incompletely understood. We previously discovered that transcription factor TFEB is a key contributor to macrophage activation during bacterial phagocytosis. However, the mechanism linking phagocytosis of bacterial cells to TFEB activation remained unknown. In this article, we describe a previously unknown pathway that links phagocytosis with the activation of TFEB and related transcription factor TFE3 in macrophages. We find that phagocytosis of bacterial cells causes an NADPH oxidase (PHOX)-dependent oxidative burst, which activates enzyme CD38 and generates NAADP in the maturing phagosome. Phago-lysosome fusion brings Ca2+ channel TRPML1/MCOLN1 in contact with NAADP, causing Ca2+ efflux from the lysosome, calcineurin activation, and TFEB nuclear import. This drives TFEB-dependent expression of important pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-1{beta}, and IL-6. Thus, our findings reveal that TFEB activation is a key regulatory event for the activation of macrophages. These findings have important implications for infections, cancer, obesity, and atherosclerosis.",

    "abstract": "Although published structural models of viral capsids generally exhibit a high degree of regularity or symmetry, structural defects might be expected because of the fluctuating environment in which capsids assemble and the requirement of some capsids for disassembly prior to genome delivery. Defective structures are observed in computer simulations, and are evident in single-particle cryoEM studies. Here, we quantify the conditions under which defects might be expected, using a statistical mechanics model allowing for ideal, defective, and vacant sites. The model displays a threshold in affinity parameters below which there is an appreciable population of defective capsids. Even when defective sites are not allowed, there is generally some population of vacancies. Analysis of single particles in cryoEM micrographs yields a confirmatory {gtrsim}15% of defective particles. Our findings suggest structural heterogeneity in virus capsids may be under-appreciated, and also points to a non-traditional strategy for assembly inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Organs mainly attain their size by cell growth and proliferation, but sometimes also grow through recruitment of undifferentiated cells. Here we investigate the participation of cell recruitment in establishing the pattern of Vestigial (Vg), the product of the wing selector gene in Drosophila. We find that the Vg pattern overscales along the dorsal-ventral (DV) axis of the wing imaginal disc, i.e., it expands faster than the DV length of the pouch. The overscaling of the Vg pattern cannot be explained by differential proliferation, apoptosis, or oriented-cell divisions, but can be recapitulated by a mathematical model that explicitly considers cell recruitment. By impairing cell recruitment genetically, we find that the Vg pattern almost perfectly scales and adult wings are approximately 20% smaller. Furthermore, using fluorescent reporter tools, we provide direct evidence that cell recruitment takes place in a specific time between early and mid third-instar larval development. Altogether, our work quantitatively shows when, how, and by how much cell recruitment shapes the Vg pattern and drives growth of the Drosophila wing.",

    "abstract": "Given the wide diversity in applications of biological mass spectrometry, custom data analyses are often needed to fully interpret the results of an experiment. Such bioinformatics scripts necessarily include similar basic functionality to read mass spectral data from standard file formats, process it, and visualize it. Rather than having to reimplement this functionality, to facilitate this task, spectrum_utils is a Python package for mass spectrometry data processing and visualization. Its high-level functionality enables developers to quickly prototype ideas for computational mass spectrometry projects in only a few lines of code. Notably, the data processing functionality is highly optimized for computational efficiency to be able to deal with the large volumes of data that are generated during mass spectrometry experiments. The visualization functionality makes it possible to easily produce publication-quality figures as well as interactive spectrum plots for inclusion on web pages. spectrum_utils is available for Python 3.6+, includes extensive online documentation and examples, and can be easily installed using conda.

Here, we use information theory to measure signatures of TF-chromatin interactions encoded in the patterns of the accessible genome, which we call chromatin information enrichment (CIE). We calculate CIE for hundreds of TF motifs across human tissues and identify two classes: low and high CIE. The 10-20% of TF motifs with high CIE associate with higher protein-DNA residence time, including different binding sites subclasses of the same TF, increased nucleosome phasing, specific protein domains, and the genetic control of both gene expression and chromatin accessibility. These results show that variations in the information content of chromatin architecture reflect functional biological variation, with implications for cell state dynamics and memory.",

The topography of the endocardium was characterized by its regional values of fractal dimension (FD), computed using a box-counting algorithm developed in-house. The average FD in each of the 16 American Heart Association segments was calculated for each subject as a function of time over the cardiac cycle. The normal subjects showed a peak systolic percentage change in FD of 5.9% {+/-} 2% in all free-wall segments, while the abnormal cohort experienced a change of 2% {+/-} 1.2% (p < 0.00001). Septal segments, being smooth, did not undergo large changes in FD. Additionally, a principal component analysis was performed on the temporal profiles of FD to highlight the possibility for unsupervised classification of normal and abnormal function. The method developed is free from manual contouring and does not require any feature tracking or registration algorithms. The FD values in the free wall segments correlated well with radial strain and with endocardial regional shortening measurements.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe growing complexity of reaction-based models necessitates early detection and resolution of model errors. This paper addresses mass balance errors, discrepancies between the mass of reactants and products in reaction specifications. One approach to detection is atomic mass analysis, which uses meta-data to expose atomic formulas of chemical species. Atomic mass analysis isolates errors to individual reactions. However, this approach burdens modelers with expressing model meta-data and writing excessively detailed reactions that include implicit chemical species (e.g., water). Moreover, atomic mass analysis has the shortcoming of not being applicable to large molecules because of the limitations of current annotation techniques. The second approach, Linear Programming (LP) analysis, avoids using model meta-data by checking for a weaker condition, stoichiometric inconsistency. But this approach suffers from false negatives and has large isolation sets (the set of reactions implicated in the stoichiometric inconsistency).\\n\\nResultsWe propose alternatives to both approaches. Our alternative to atomic mass analysis is moiety analysis. Moiety analysis uses model meta-data in the form of moieties present in chemical species. Moiety analysis avoids excessively detailed reaction specifications, and can be used with large molecules. Our alternative to LP analysis is Graphical Analysis of Mass Equivalence Sets (GAMES). GAMES has a slightly higher false negative rate than LP analysis, but it provides much better error isolation. In our studies of the BioModels Repository, the average size of isolation sets for LP analysis is 55.5; for GAMES, it is 5.4. We have created open source codes for moiety analysis and GAMES.\\n\\nAvailability and ImplementationOur project is hosted at https://github.com/ModelEngineering/ SBMLLint, which contains examples, documentation, source code files, and build scripts used to create SBMLLint.

Here we analyse the cellular structures and complex life cycles of the novel unicellular holozoans Pigoraptor and Syssomonas (Opisthokonta). Both lineages are characterized by complex life cycles with a variety of cell types, the formation of multicellular aggregations and syncytium-like structures, and an unusual diet for single-celled opisthokonts (partial cell fusion and joint sucking of a large eukaryotic prey), all of which provide new insights into the origin of multicellularity in Metazoa. The ability to feed on large eukaryotic prey could have been a powerful trigger in the formation and development both aggregative (e.g., joint feeding, which also implies signalling) and clonal (e.g., hypertrophic growth followed by palintomy) multicellular stages that played important roles in the emergence of multicellular animals.",

    "abstract": "Molecular switches are essential modules in signaling networks and transcriptional reprogramming. Here, we describe a role for small ubiquitin-related-modifier SUMO as a molecular switch in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we compared the endogenous SUMO-proteomes of Hela cells before and after EGF-stimulation. Thereby, we identified a small group of transcriptional co-regulators including IRF2BP1, IRF2BP2 and IRF2BPL as novel players in EGFR signaling. Comparison of cells expressing wildtype or SUMOylation deficient IRF2BP1 indicated that transient deSUMOylation of IRF2BP1 is important for appropriate expression of immediate early genes including Dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1, MKP-1), an important feedback regulator of EGFR signaling. We find that IRF2BP1 is a SUMO-dependent repressor, whose transient deSUMOylation on the DUSP1 promotor allows - and whose timely reSUMOylation restricts - DUSP1 expression. Our work thus provides a paradigm how comparative SUMO proteome analyses serve to reveal novel regulators in signal transduction and transcription.",

    "abstract": "In Drosophila melanogaster, mushroom body and anterior paired lateral (APL) neurons play important roles not only in learning and memory but also in high cognitive behavior, reversal learning. The circuit between APL neurons and Kenyon cells (KCs) in the mushroom body underlies this behavior, including reversal learning, and electron microscopy (EM) methods must be used to reveal this circuit. Here, we reconstructed the connections between mushroom body cells and APL neurons in the vertical lobe of the mushroom body via focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) and sparse genetic horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labeling. We offer the first EM evidence that recurrent network and lateral inhibition connections exist between APL neurons and KCs in the vertical lobe of the mushroom body. This circuit is the neural basis of action selection decision making, associative learning and reversal learning. Additionally, dopamine neurons project to different areas of mushroom bodies and, together with extrinsic neurons and KC axons, form a compartmental structure of mushroom body axons, thereby restricting the KC-mushroom body output neuron (MBON) response to local compartments. Whether APL neurons also respond locally is uncertain. We found that APL neurons exhibited input and output synapses that were intermixed and arranged on enlarged and thin sections, respectively, resembling a string of beads. Different KCs were found to project to APL neurons nonrepetitively, forming a local circuit structure. Furthermore, using a single neurite calcium imaging method, we identified local calcium domains on this circuit, suggestive of individual electrical compartments. The electrically recorded APL neurons were nonspike neurons that selectively responded to odor in both the lobes and calyx. Thus, the localized APL neuron responses coordinate with mushroom body-dopamine-MBON compartmental function.",
