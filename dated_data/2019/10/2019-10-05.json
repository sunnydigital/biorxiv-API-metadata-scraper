    "abstract": "Lakes and other freshwater bodies are intimately connected to the surrounding land, yet to what extent land-use affects the quality of freshwater and the microbial communities living in various freshwater environments is largely unknown. We address this question through an analysis of the land use surrounding 46 inter-connected lakes located within 7 different drainage basins in northern Germany, and the microbiomes of these lakes during early summer. Lake microbiome structure was not determined by the specific drainage basin or by basin size, and bacterial distribution did not seem to be limited by distance. Instead, land use within the drainage basin could predict, to some extent, NO2+NO3 concentrations in the water, which (together with temperature, chlorophyll a and total phosphorus) affected water microbiome structure. Land use directly surrounding the water bodies, however, had little observable effects on water quality or the microbiome. Several microbial lineages, including environmentally important Cyanobacteria and Verrucomicrobia, were differentially partitioned between the lakes. As the amount of available data on land use (e.g. from remote sensing) increases, identifying relationships between land use, aquatic microbial communities and their effect on water quality will be important to better manage freshwater resources worldwide, e.g. by systemically identifying water bodies prone to ecological changes or the presence of harmful organisms.",

    "abstract": "In an individualized animal society, social bonds can foster cooperation and enhance survival and reproduction. Cooperative bonds often exist among kin, but nonkin can also develop high-investment cooperative bonds that share similarities with human friendship. How do such bonds form? One theory suggests that strangers should  test the waters of a new relationship by making small initial cooperative investments and gradually escalating them with good partners. This  raising-the-stakes strategy is demonstrated by human strangers in short-term economic games, but it remains unclear whether it applies to helping in a natural long-term social bond. Here we show evidence that unfamiliar vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) selectively escalate low-cost investments in allogrooming before developing higher-cost food-sharing relationships. We introduced females from geographically distant sites in pairs or groups and observed that bats established new reciprocal grooming relationships, and that increasing grooming rates predicted the occurrence of first food donations, at which point grooming rates no longer increased. New food-sharing relationships emerged reciprocally in 14% of female pairs, typically over 10-15 months, and developed faster when strangers lacked alternative familiar partners. A gradual grooming-to-sharing transition among past strangers suggests that  raising the stakes might be more evident when tracking multiple cooperative behaviours as new relationships form, rather than measuring a single behavior in an established relationship.  Raising the stakes could play a similar underappreciated role across a broader spectrum of social decisions with long-term consequences, such as joining a new social group or forming a long-term pair-bond.\n\nSignificance statementVampire bats form long-term cooperative social bonds that involve reciprocal food sharing. How do two unrelated bats go from being strangers to having a high-investment food-sharing relationship? We introduced unfamiliar bats and found evidence that low-cost grooming paves the way for higher-cost food donations. Food sharing emerged in a reciprocal fashion and it emerged faster when two strangers did not have access to their original groupmates. The bats that formed new food-sharing relationships had a history of escalating reciprocal grooming up until the food sharing began. Our finding that unfamiliar nonkin vampire bats appear to gradually and selectively transition from low-cost to high-cost cooperative behaviors is the first evidence that nonhuman individuals  raise the stakes when forming new cooperative relationships.",

    "abstract": "Future boundaries of skeletal muscle segments are determined in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM). Within the PSM, future somitic cells undergo significant changes in both morphology and position. How such large-scale cellular changes are coordinated and the effect on the future border formation is unknown. We find that cellular rearrangements differ between cell populations within the PSM. In contrast to lateral somitic cells, which display less organized rearrangement, the adaxial cell layer undergoes significant tissue shearing with dorsal and ventral cells sliding posteriorly. This shear is generated by orientated intercalations of dorsally and ventrally located adaxial cells, which induces a chevron-like pattern. We find Shh signaling is required for the tissue shear and morphogenesis of adaxial cells. In particular, we observe Shh-dependent polarized recruitment of non-muscle myosin IIA drives apical constrictions, and thus the intercalations and shear. This reveals a novel role for Shh in regulating cell mechanics in the PSM.",

    "abstract": "Hand movements are controlled by neuronal networks in primary motor cortex (M1). The organising principle in M1 does not follow an anatomical body map, but rather a distributed representational structure in which motor primitives are combined to produce motor outputs. Both electrophysiological recordings in primates and human imaging data suggest that M1 encodes kinematic features of movements, such as joint position and velocity. However, M1 exhibits well-documented sensory responses to cutaneous and proprioceptive stimuli, raising questions regarding the origins of kinematic motor representations: are they relevant in top-down motor control, or are they an epiphenomenon of bottom-up sensory feedback during movement? Moreover, to what extent is information related to muscle activity encoded in motor cortex? Here we provide evidence for spatially and temporally distinct encoding of kinematic and muscle information in human M1 during the production of a wide variety of naturalistic hand movements. Using a powerful combination of high-field fMRI and MEG, a spatial and temporal multivariate representational similarity analysis revealed encoding of kinematic information from data glove recordings in more caudal regions of M1, over 200ms before movement onset. In contrast, patterns of muscle activity from EMG were encoded in more rostral motor regions later in the cycle of movement. Our spatial and temporal analysis provide compelling evidence that top-down control of dexterous movement engages kinematic representations in caudal regions of M1 prior to movement production; an area with direct cortico-motorneuronal connections. Muscle information encoded more rostrally in M1 was engaged later, suggestive of involvement in bottom-up signalling.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMore than 80% of all animal species remain unknown to science. Most of these species live in the tropics and belong to animal taxa that combine small body size with high specimen abundance and large species richness. For such clades, using morphology for species discovery is slow because large numbers of specimens must be sorted using detailed microscopic investigations. Fortunately, species discovery could be greatly accelerated if DNA sequences could be used for sorting specimens to species. Morphological verification of such \\\"molecular Operational Taxonomic Units\\\" (mOTUs) could then be based on dissection of a small subset of specimens. However, this approach requires cost-effective and low-tech DNA barcoding techniques because well equipped, well-funded molecular laboratories are not readily available in many biodiverse countries.\\n\\nResultsWe here document how MinION sequencing can be used for large-scale species discovery in a specimen- and species-rich taxon like the hyper-diverse fly family Phoridae (Diptera). We sequenced 7,059 specimens collected in a single Malaise trap in Kibale National Park, Uganda over the short period of eight weeks. We discovered >650 species which exceeded the number of phorid species currently described for the entire Afrotropical region. The barcodes were obtained using an improved low-cost MinION pipeline that increased the barcoding capacity sevenfold from 500 to 3,500 barcodes per flowcell. This was achieved by adopting 1D sequencing, re-sequencing weak amplicons on a used flowcell, and improving demultiplexing. Comparison with Illumina data revealed that the MinION barcodes were very accurate (99.99% accuracy, 0.46% Ns) and thus yielded very similar species units (match ratio: 0.991). Morphological examination of 100 mOTUs also confirmed good congruence with morphology (93% of mOTUs; >99% of specimens) and revealed that 90% of the putative species belong to a neglected, megadiverse genus (Megaselia). We demonstrate for one Megaselia species how the molecular data can guide the description of a new species (Megaselia sepsioides sp. nov.).\\n\\nConclusionsWe document that one field site in Africa can be home to an estimated 1000 species of phorids and speculate that the Afrotropical diversity could exceed 100,000 species. We furthermore conclude that low-cost MinION sequencers are very suitable for reliable, rapid, and large-scale species discovery in hyperdiverse taxa. MinION sequencing could quickly reveal the extent of the unknown diversity and is especially suitable for biodiverse countries with limited access to capital-intensive sequencing facilities.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT/ SUMMARYOligodendrocytes (OLs) are the only myelinating glia in the central nervous system (CNS). In congenital myelin disorders, OL dysfunction or death results in loss of myelin. This causes progressive and irreversible impairment to motor and cognitive functions, and is amongst the most disabling neurological disorder.\n\nNeonatal engraftment by glial progenitor cells (GPCs) allows the robust myelination of congenitally dysmyelinated brain, thereby preserving brain function and quality of life of patients. However, endogenous sources of glial progenitors are hard to obtain without causing secondary injury, while use of exogenous sources such as embryonic stem cells and induced-pluripotent stem cells face considerable ethical and safety issues.\n\nTo circumvent such hurdles, we asked whether NG2+ cells in the bone marrow could be a potential cell source for GPCs. We successfully generated glial progenitor cells (GPCs) from human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) from 3 donors using a 14- day induction protocol. The generated hBMSC-GPCs were highly enriched in OPC marker expression, including OLIG2, PDGFR, NG2, SOX10 and O4, and showed efficient differentiation into myelinogenic oligodendrocytes when transplanted into postnatal day 7 (P7) myelin-deficient shiverer mice. Remyelination of the shiverer mouse brain significantly extended lifespan and improved motor function.\n\nThe novel induction protocol described here provides a method for fast, simple and effective glial therapy for myelin disorders, overcoming existent hurdles of cell source restriction and time frame requirement.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=153 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/658997v8_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@104a62corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@399a67org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c81ee1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16374da_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Highlights- Human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) can be programmed to myelinating glia (GPCs, glial progenitor cells), via a novel 14-day in vitro induction protocol\n- Transplantation of these hBM-GPCs robustly remyelinated myelin deficient shiverer mice.\n- hBM-GPC transplant significantly extended lifespan, increased body weight and improved motor function",

Here we used a multimodal model to systematically assess how neurons in the anterior thalamic nuclei, retrosplenial cortex and anterior hippocampus of mice, as well as in the cingulum fiber bundle and the white matter regions surrounding the hippocampus, encode an array of navigational variables when animals forage in a circular arena. In addition to coding head direction, we found that some thalamic cells encode the animals allocentric position, similar to place cells. We also found that a large fraction of retrosplenial neurons, as well as some hippocampal neurons, encode the egocentric position of the arenas boundary. We compared the multimodal model to traditional methods of head direction tuning and place field analysis, and found that the latter were inapplicable to multimodal regions such as the anterior thalamus and retrosplenial cortex. Our results draw a new picture of the signals carried and outputted by the anterior thalamus and retrosplenial cortex, offer new insights on navigational variables represented in the hippocampus and its vicinity, and emphasize the importance of using multimodal models to investigate neural coding throughout the navigation system.",

To understand the mechanisms governing these dynamics, it is necessary to capture multi-timescale structure from behavioural data. Here, we develop computational tools and study the behaviour of hundreds of larval zebrafish tracked continuously across multiple 24-hour day/night cycles. We extracted millions of movements and pauses, termed bouts, and used unsupervised learning to reduce each larvas behaviour to an alternating sequence of active and inactive bout types, termed modules. Through hierarchical compression, we identified recurrent behavioural patterns, termed motifs. Module and motif usage varied across the day/night cycle, revealing structure at sub-second to day-long timescales. We further demonstrate that module and motif analysis can uncover novel pharmacological and genetic mutant phenotypes. Overall, our work reveals the organisation of larval zebrafish behaviour at multiple timescales and provides tools to identify structure from large-scale behavioural datasets.",

    "abstract": "Multiple organ dysfunction induced by sepsis often involves kidney injury. Extracellular histones released in response to damage-associated molecular patterns are known to facilitate sepsis-induced organ dysfunction. Recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rhTM) and its lectin-like domain (D1) exert anti-inflammatory effects and neutralize damage-associated molecular patterns. However, the effects of rhTM and D1 on extracellular histone H3 levels and kidney injury remain poorly understood. Our purpose was to investigate the association between extracellular histone H3 levels and kidney injury, and to clarify the effects of rhTM and D1 on extracellular histone H3 levels, kidney injury, and survival in sepsis-induced rats. Rats in whom sepsis was induced via cecal ligation and puncture were used in this study. Histone H3 levels, histopathology of the kidneys, and the survival rate of rats at 24 h after cecal ligation and puncture were investigated. Histone H3 levels increased over time following cecal ligation and puncture. Histopathological analyses indicated that the distribution of degeneration foci among tubular epithelial cells of the kidney and levels of histone H3 increased simultaneously. Administration of rhTM and D1 significantly reduced histone H3 levels compared with that in the vehicle-treated group and improved kidney injury. The survival rates of rats in rhTM- and D1-treated groups were significantly higher than that in the vehicle-treated group. The results of this study indicated that rhTM and its D1 similarly reduce elevated histone H3 levels, thereby reducing acute kidney injury. Our findings also proposed that rhTM and D1 show potential as new treatment strategies for sepsis combined with acute kidney injury.",

    "abstract": "A powerful approach to understand protein structure and evolution is to perform computer simulations that mimic aspects of evolution. In particular, structure-based computational protein design (CPD) can address the inverse folding problem, exploring a large space of amino acid sequences and selecting ones predicted to adopt a given fold. Previously, CPD has been used to entirely redesign several proteins: all or most of the protein sequence was allowed to mutate freely; among sampled sequences, those with low computed folding energy were selected, and a few percent of them did indeed adopt the correct fold. Those studies used an energy function that was partly or largely knowledge-based, with several empirical terms. Here, we show that a PDZ domain can be entirely redesigned using a \\\"physics-based\\\" energy function that combines standard molecular mechanics and a recent, continuum electrostatic solvent model. Many thousands of sequences were generated by Monte Carlo simulation. Among the lowest-energy sequences, three were chosen for experimental testing. All three could be overexpressed and had native-like circular dichroism and 1D-NMR spectra. Two exhibited an increase in their thermal denaturation curves when a peptide ligand was present, indicating binding and suggesting correctly folded proteins. Evidently, the physical principles that govern molecular mechanics and continuum electrostatics are sufficient to perform whole-protein redesign. This is encouraging, since these methods provide physical insights, can be systematically improved, and are transferable to other biopolymers and ligands of medical or technological interest.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=73 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/790667v3_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (26K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@145ea28org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10ffa2forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f2460eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d5691c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Table of Contents Graphic\\n\\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Each gene has its own evolutionary history which can substantially differ from the evolutionary histories of other genes. For example, some individual genes or operons can be affected by specific horizontal gene transfer or hybridization events. Thus, the evolutionary history of each gene should be represented by its own phylogenetic tree which may display different evolutionary patterns from the species tree, or Tree of Life, that represents the main patterns of vertical descent. Here, we present a new efficient method for inferring single or multiple consensus trees and supertrees for a given set of phylogenetic trees (i.e. additive trees or X-trees). The output of the traditional tree consensus methods is a unique consensus tree or supertree. Here, we show how Machine Learning (ML) models, based on some interesting properties of the Robinson and Foulds topological distance, can be used to partition a given set of trees into one (when the data are homogeneous) or multiple (when the data are heterogeneous) cluster(s) of trees. We adapt the popular Accuracy, Precision, Sensitivity, and F1 scores to the tree clustering. A special attention is paid to the relevant, but very challenging, problem of inferring alternative supertrees that are built from phylogenies defined on different, but mutually overlapping, sets of species. The use of an approximate objective function in clustering makes the new method faster than the existing tree clustering techniques and thus suitable for the analysis of large genomic datasets.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing technologies are widely used in recent years as a powerful tool allowing the observation of gene expression at the resolution of single cells. Two of the major challenges in scRNA-seq data analysis are dropout events and batch effects. The inflation of zero(dropout rate) varies substantially across single cells. Evidence has shown that technical noise, including batch effects, explains a notable proportion of this cell-to-cell variation. To capture biological variation, it is necessary to quantify and remove technical variation. Here, we introduce SCRIBE (Single-Cell Recovery Imputation with Batch Effects), a principled framework that imputes dropout events and corrects batch effects simultaneously. We demonstrate, through real examples, that SCRIBE outperforms existing scRNA-seq data analysis tools in recovering cell-specific gene expression patterns, removing batch effects and retaining biological variation across cells.

    "abstract": "The heat shock response is the organized molecular response to stressors which disrupt proteostasis, potentially leading to protein misfolding and aggregation. While the regulation of the heat shock response is well-studied in single cells, its coordination at the cell, tissue, and systemic levels of a multicellular organism is poorly understood. To probe the interplay between systemic and cell-autonomous responses, we studied the upregulation of HSP-16.2, a molecular chaperone induced throughout the intestine of Caenorhabditis elegans following a heat shock, by taking longitudinal measurements in a microfluidic environment. Based on the dynamics of HSP-16.2 accumulation, we showed that a combination of heat shock temperature and duration define the intensity of stress inflicted on the worm and identified two regimes of low and high intensity stress. Modeling the underlying regulatory dynamics implicated the saturation of heat shock protein mRNA production in defining these two regimes and emphasized the importance of time separation between transcription and translation in establishing these dynamics. By applying a heat shock and measuring the response in separate parts of the animals, we implicated thermosensory neurons in accelerating the response and transducing information within the animal. We discuss possible implications of the systemic and cell level aspects and how they coordinate to facilitate the organismal response.",

    "abstract": "The Sec translocon is a highly conserved membrane complex for transport of polypeptides across, or into, lipid bilayers. In bacteria, the core protein-channel SecYEG resides in the inner-membrane, through which secretion is powered by the cytosolic ATPase SecA. Here, we use single-molecule fluorescence to interrogate the dynamic state of SecYEG throughout the hydrolytic cycle of SecA. We show that the SecYEG channel fluctuates between open and closed states faster ([~]20-fold during transport) than ATP turnover; while the nucleotide status of SecA modulates the rates of opening and closure. Interestingly, a SecY variant (PrlA4), exhibiting faster protein transport, but unaffected ATPase rates, increases the dwell time in the open state, facilitating pre-protein diffusion through the pore; thereby improving the efficiency of translocation. Thus, contrary to prevailing structure-based models, SecYEG plays an integral part in the translocation mechanism through dynamic allosteric coupling in which SecA  steers the energy landscape of the protein-channel.",

    "abstract": "The diversity of teaching professional development (PD) programs that occurred over the last few decades merits our collective attention to assess the impact of these programs over time. In general, the goal of PD programs is that participants continue to practice what they learn in the long term. However, we do not know the degree to which the outcomes of these programs were achieved and ultimately persist. We tracked postdoc participants from the Faculty Institutes for Reformed Science Teaching (FIRST) IV program into their current position as early-career faculty at institutions across the United States. We assessed their teaching approaches, practices, and student perceptions of the learning environment over 6-10 years. Additionally, the FIRST IV faculty were paired with colleagues of similar status in the same departments. We found that professional development outcomes from the FIRST IV program persisted over time and across a significant career transition, from postdoc to faculty. These participants not only maintained their student-centered practices, but were significantly more student-focused than their peers. Lastly, we found that faculty approaches to teaching were correlated with observed teaching practices in the classroom for both groups of faculty. These results provide compelling evidence for the success of the FIRST IV program and the long-term persistence of professional development outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The geometry of reaction compartments can affect the outcome of chemical reactions. Synthetic biology commonly uses giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) to generate cell-sized, membrane-bound reaction compartments. However, these liposomes are always spherical due to surface area minimization. Here, we have developed a microfluidic chip to trap and reversibly deform GUVs into rod- or cigar-like shapes, including a constriction site in the trap mimicking the membrane furrow in cell division. When we introduce into these GUVs the bacterial tubulin homologue FtsZ, the primary protein of the bacterial Z ring, we find that FtsZ organization changes from dynamic rings to elongated filaments upon GUV deformation, and that these FtsZ filaments align preferentially with the short GUV axis, in particular at the membrane neck. In contrast, pulsing Min oscillations in GUVs remained largely unaffected. We conclude that microfluidic traps are a useful tool for deforming GUVs into non-spherical membrane shapes, akin to those seen in cell division, and for investigating the effect of confinement geometry on biochemical reactions, such as protein filament self-organization.",

Furthermore, high-resolution cryo-EM structures reveal structural rearrangements in F-actin upon inorganic phosphate release in phalloidin-stabilized filaments. We find that the effect of the sponge toxin jasplakinolide differs from the one of phalloidin, despite their overlapping binding site and similar interactions with the actin filament.

    "abstract": "A myriad of transient, nanoscopic lipid- and protein-based interactions confer a steady-state organization of plasma membrane in resting cells that is poised to orchestrate assembly of key signaling components upon reception of an extracellular stimulus. Although difficult to observe directly in live cells, these subtle interactions can be discerned by their impact on the diffusion of membrane constituents. Herein, we quantified the diffusion properties of a panel of structurally distinct lipid-anchored and transmembrane (TM) probes in RBL mast cells by multiplexed Imaging Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy. We developed a statistical analysis of data combined from many pixels over multiple cells to characterize differences as small as 10% in diffusion coefficients, which reflect differences in underlying interactions. We found that the distinctive diffusion properties of lipid-anchored probes can be explained by their dynamic partitioning into ordered proteo-lipid nanodomains, which encompass a major fraction of the membrane and whose physical properties are influenced by actin polymerization. Effects on diffusion by functional protein modules in both lipid-anchored and TM probes reflect additional complexity in steady-state membrane organization. The contrast we observe between different probes diffusing through the same membrane milieu represent the dynamic resting steady-state, which serves as a baseline for monitoring plasma membrane remodeling that occurs upon stimulation.",

Yet, its function during embryonic development is poorly understood. The zebrafish APP homologue, Appb, is strongly expressed during early development but thus far has only been studied via morpholino-mediated knockdown. Zebrafish enables analysis of cellular processes in an ontogenic context, which is limited in many other vertebrates. We characterized zebrafish carrying a homozygous mutation that introduces a premature stop in exon 2 of the appb gene. We report that appb mutants are significantly smaller until 2dpf and display perturbed enveloping layer (EVL) integrity and cell protrusions at the blastula stage.\\n\\nMoreover, appb mutants surviving beyond 48 hpf exhibited no behavioral defects at 6 dpf and developed into healthy and fertile adults. The expression of the app-family members, appa and aplp2, was found to be altered in appb mutants. Taken together, we show that appb orchestrates the initial development by supporting the integrity of the EVL, likely by mediating cell adhesion properties. The loss of Appb might be compensated for by other app family members to be able to implement continued normal development.",

Here we demonstrate that Myoglianin (Myo), an Activin family member, and a close homolog of mammalian Myostatin (Mstn), is a muscle-derived extrinsic factor that uses canonical dSmad2 mediated signaling to regulate wing size.

Manipulating neural activity, brain rhythms or synchronization is of significant therapeutic interest in several neurological disorders and can be achieved by different means such as transcranial current and magnetic stimulation techniques, and by light through optogenetics, although the clinical translation of the latter is hampered by the need of gene therapy. Here, we directly modulate brain rhythms with light using a novel photoswitchable muscarinic agonist. Synchronous slow wave activity is transformed into a higher frequency pattern in the cerebral cortex both in slices in vitro and in anesthetized mice.

In search of direct evidence to support or refute this hypothesis, here, we studied the process of cuticle formation in the tibia of the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria, where daily growth layers arise by the deposition of fiber arrangements alternating between unidirectional and helicoidal structures. Using FIB/SEM volume imaging and scanning X-ray scattering, we show that the epidermal cells determine an initial fiber orientation from which the final architecture emerges by the self-organized co-assembly of chitin and proteins. Fiber orientation in the locust cuticle is therefore determined by both active and passive processes.",

The nanodevice is comprised of two strands, one of which can be selectively switched between a G-quadruplex and duplex or single-stranded conformations. In the G-quadruplex state, it binds the cofactor hemin, enabling peroxidase activity. This switching ability arises from our discovery that perchlorate, a chaotropic Hofmeister ion, selectively destabilizes duplex over G-quadruplex DNA. By varying perchlorate concentration, we show that the device can be switched between states that do and do not catalyze electron transfer catalysis. State switching can be achieved in three ways: thermally, by dilution, or by concentration. In each case, when operated in the presence of the cofactor hemin, the device catalyzes electron transfer in only the G-quadruplex state.",

To that extent, 152 participants played multiple rounds of the Prisoners Dilemma game in a naturalistic dyadic interaction setting. During one round of games they could see each other, and during a second round they could not. The results showed that when peoples heart rate and skin conductance level aligned, they cooperated more successfully. Interestingly, for skin conductance level synchrony to boost cooperation, face to face contact was essential. The effect of heart rate synchrony on cooperation was context independent. Skin conductance level, but not heart rate, tended to closely correlate with changes in pupil size and we discuss how the pupil might provide a window to partners sympathetic arousal. These findings show how unconscious mechanisms guide social behavior and emphasize the importance of studying social processes between rather than within individuals in real-life interactions.\n\nSignificance StatementHuman cooperation is remarkable in its scale, complexity, and efficiency. However, whereas people think of themselves as rational agents, they actually partly base their decision to cooperate with someone on gut feelings. These feelings are informed by non-verbal expressions that are picked up implicitly and that synchronize across interaction partners. For the first time, we show that the alignment of peoples arousal over multiple rounds of the Prisoners dilemma game predicts cooperative success. Through synchrony, partners converge emotionally, fostering understanding and bonding, which are key ingredients when it comes to successful cooperation. This suggests that successfully cooperating does not depend on individuals, but on the connection between individuals, emphasizing the importance of studying social decision-making processes in real-life settings.",

Also, genes that code for the immunoglobulin constant regions were also not found. A detailed analysis of the chromosomal region of these genes revealed a deletion in the entire locus for regions of the heavy and light chains. These studies provide evidence that this species does not possess genes coding for immunoglobulins. Additionally, we found the genes that code for CD79a and CD79b protein molecules have also been deleted. Regions for the T/{beta} lymphocyte receptors are present but the T{gamma} /{delta} receptors were not found.

    "abstract": "Guanylate binding proteins (GBPs), a family of interferon (IFN)-inducible GTPases, can promote cell-intrinsic defense by removal of intracellular microbial replicative niches through host cell death. GBPs target pathogen-containing vacuoles or the pathogen itself, and assist in membrane-disruption and release of microbial molecules that trigger cell death by activating the inflammasomes. We previously showed that GBP1 mediates atypical apoptosis or pyroptosis of human macrophages infected with Toxoplasma gondii (Tg) or Salmonella enterica Typhimurium (STm), respectively. In mice, the p47 Immunity-related GTPases (IRGs) control the recruitment of GBPs to microbe-containing vacuoles and subsequent cell death. However, humans are devoid of functional IRGs, and the pathogen-proximal immune detection mechanisms by GBP1 are poorly understood. Here, we describe two novel single-cell assays which show that GBP1 promotes the lysis of Tg-containing vacuoles and Tg plasma membrane, resulting in the cytosolic detection of Tg-DNA. In contrast, we show GBP1 only targets cytosolic STm and does not contribute to bacterial escape into the cytosol of human macrophages. GBP1 interacts with caspase-4 and recruits it directly to the bacterial surface, where caspase-4 can be activated by LPS. During STm infection, caspase-1 cleaves and inactivates GBP1 at Asp192, a site conserved in related mammalian GBP1 proteins but not in murine Gbps. STm-infected human macrophages expressing a cleavage-deficient GBP1 mutant exhibit higher pyroptosis due to the absence of caspase-1-mediated feedback inhibition of the GBP1-caspase-4 pathway. Our comparative studies elucidate microbe-specific spatiotemporal roles of GBP1 in detecting infection and the assembly and regulation of divergent caspase signaling platforms.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a threat to public health. Clinical microbiology laboratories typically rely on culturing bacteria for antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST). As the implementation costs and technical barriers fall, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has emerged as a  one-stop test for epidemiological and predictive AST results. Few published comparisons exist for the myriad analytical pipelines used for predicting AMR. To address this, we performed an inter-laboratory study providing sets of participating researchers with identical short-read WGS data sequenced from clinical isolates, allowing us to assess the reproducibility of the bioinformatic prediction of AMR between participants and identify problem cases and factors that lead to discordant results.\\n\\nMethodsWe produced ten WGS datasets of varying quality from cultured carbapenem-resistant organisms obtained from clinical samples sequenced on either an Illumina NextSeq or HiSeq instrument. Nine participating teams ( participants) were provided these sequence data without any other contextual information. Each participant used their own pipeline to determine the species, the presence of resistance-associated genes, and to predict susceptibility or resistance to amikacin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime.\\n\\nResultsIndividual participants predicted different numbers of AMR-associated genes and different gene variants from the same clinical samples. The quality of the sequence data, choice of bioinformatic pipeline and interpretation of the results all contributed to discordance between participants. Although much of the inaccurate gene variant annotation did not affect genotypic resistance predictions, we observed low specificity when compared to phenotypic AST results but this improved in samples with higher read depths. Had the results been used to predict AST and guide treatment a different antibiotic would have been recommended for each isolate by at least one participant.\\n\\nConclusionsWe found that participants produced discordant predictions from identical WGS data. These challenges, at the final analytical stage of using WGS to predict AMR, suggest the need for refinements when using this technology in clinical settings. Comprehensive public resistance sequence databases and standardisation in the comparisons between genotype and resistance phenotypes will be fundamental before AST prediction using WGS can be successfully implemented in standard clinical microbiology laboratories.",

Individual gamma-cycles show spontaneous variability in amplitude and duration. The mechanisms underlying this variability are not fully understood. We recorded local-field-potentials (LFPs) and spikes from awake macaque V1, and developed a noise-robust method to detect gamma-cycle amplitudes and durations. Amplitudes and durations showed a weak but positive correlation. This correlation, and the joint amplitude-duration distribution, is well reproduced by a dampened harmonic oscillator driven by stochastic noise. We show that this model accurately fits LFP power spectra and is equivalent to a linear PING (Pyramidal Interneuron Network Gamma) circuit. The model recapitulates two additional features of V1 gamma: (1) Amplitude-duration correlations decrease with oscillation strength; (2) Amplitudes and durations exhibit strong and weak autocorrelations, respectively, depending on oscillation strength. Finally, longer gamma-cycles are associated with stronger spike-synchrony, but lower spike-rates in both (putative) excitatory and inhibitory neurons. In sum, V1 gamma-dynamics are well described by the simplest possible model of gamma: A linear harmonic oscillator driven by noise.",

Conventional application of a fixed-dose of tDCS does not account for inter-individual differences in anatomy (e.g. skull thickness), which varies the amount of current reaching the brain. Individualised dose-control may reduce the variable effects of tDCS by reducing variability in electric field intensities at a cortical target site.\\n\\nObjectiveTo characterise the variability in electric field intensity at a cortical site (left primary motor cortex; M1) and throughout the brain for conventional fixed-dose tDCS, and individualised dose-controlled tDCS.\\n\\nMethodsThe intensity and distribution of the electric field during tDCS was estimated using Realistic Volumetric Approach to Simulate Transcranial Electric Stimulation (ROAST) in 50 individual brain scans taken from the Human Connectome Project, for fixed-dose tDCS (1mA & 2mA) and individualised dose-controlled tDCS targeting left M1.\\n\\nResultsWith a fixed-dose (1mA & 2mA), E-field intensity in left M1 varied by more than 100% across individuals, with substantial variation observed throughout the brain as well.

Results showed the CSA of the diaphragm muscle increased significantly by 26.1%, whereas the CSA of the gastrocnemius muscle decreased significantly by 20.4% in the hibernation group compared with the summer active group. Both muscles displayed a significant fast-to-slow fiber-type transition in hibernation. Our study further indicated that increased protein synthesis, decreased protein degradation, and increased muscle regeneration potential contributed to diaphragm muscle hypertrophy, whereas decreased protein synthesis, increased protein degradation, and decreased muscle regeneration potential contributed to gastrocnemius muscle atrophy.

Regarding ketamine effects on anxiety, there is a widespread discordance among pre-clinical studies. To address this issue, the present study reviewed the literature (electronic database MEDLINE) to summarize the profile of ketamine effects in animal tests of anxiety/fear. We found that ketamine anxiety/fear-related effects may depend on the anxiety paradigm, schedule of ketamine administration and tested species. Moreover, there was no report of ketamine effects in animal tests of fear related to panic disorder (PD). Based on that finding, we evaluated if treatment with ketamine and another NMDA antagonist, MK-801, would induce acute and sustained (24 hours later) anxiolytic and/or panicolytic-like effects in animals exposed to the elevated T-maze (ETM). The ETM evaluates, in the same animal, conflict-evoked and fear behaviors, which are related, respectively, to generalized anxiety disorder and PD. Male Wistar rats were systemically treated with racemic ketamine (10, 30 and 80 mg/kg) or MK-801 (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg) and tested in the ETM in the same day or 24 hours after their administration. Ketamine did not affect the behavioral tasks performed in the ETM acutely or 24 h later. MK-801 impaired inhibitory avoidance in the ETM only at 45 min post-injection, suggesting a rapid but not sustained anxiolytic-like effect.

    "abstract": "Pandoraviruses are giant viruses of amoebae with 1 m-long virions. They have an ovoid morphology and are surrounded by a tegument-like structure lacking any capsid protein nor any gene encoding a capsid protein. In this work, we studied the ultrastructure of the tegument surrounding Pandoravirus massiliensis virions and noticed that this tegument is composed of a peripheral sugar layer, an electron-dense membrane, and a thick electron-dense layer consisting in several tubules arranged in a helicoidal structure resembling that of cellulose. Pandoravirus massiliensis particles were stained by Calcofluor white, a fluorescent dye of cellulose, and the enzymatic treatment of particles by cellulase showed the degradation of the viral tegument. We first hypothesized that the cellulose tegument could be synthesized by enzymes encoded by Pandoravirus. Bioinformatic analyses revealed in Pandoravirus massiliensis, a candidate gene encoding a putative cellulose synthase, with a homology with the BcsA domain, one of the catalytic subunits of the bacterial cellulose synthase, but with a low level of homology. This gene was transcribed during the replicative cycle of Pandoravirus massiliensis, but several arguments run counter to this hypothesis. Indeed, even if this gene is present in other Pandoraviruses, the one of the strain studied is the only one to have this BcsA domain and no other enzymes involved in the synthesis of cellulose could be detected, although we cannot rule out that such genes could have been undetected among the large proportion of Orfans of Pandoraviruses. As an alternative, we investigated whether Pandoravirus could divert the cellulose synthesis machinery of the amoeba to its own account. Indeed, contrary to what is observed in the case of infections with other giant viruses such as mimivirus, it appears that the transcription of the amoeba, at least for the cellulose synthase gene, continues throughout the growth phase of envelopes of Pandoravirus. Finally, we believe that this scenario is more plausible. If confirmed, it could be a unique mechanism in the virosphere.",

    "abstract": "The volume of biological database records is growing rapidly, populated by complex records drawn from heterogeneous sources. A specific challenge is duplication, that is, the presence of redundancy (records with high similarity) or inconsistency (dissimilar records that correspond to the same entity). The characteristics (which records are duplicates), impact (why duplicates are significant), and solutions (how to address duplication), are not well understood. Studies on the topic are neither recent nor comprehensive. In addition, other data quality issues, such as inconsistencies and inaccuracies, are also of concern in the context of biological databases. A primary focus of this paper is to present and consolidate the opinions of over 20 experts and practitioners on the topic of duplication in biological sequence databases. The results reveal that survey participants believe that duplicate records are diverse; that the negative impacts of duplicates are severe, while positive impacts depend on correct identification of duplicates; and that duplicate detection methods need to be more precise, scalable, and robust. A secondary focus is to consider other quality issues. We observe that biocuration is the key mechanism used to ensure the quality of this data, and explore the issues through a case study of curation in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot as well as an interview with an experienced biocurator. While biocuration is a vital solution for handling of data quality issues, a broader community effort is needed to provide adequate support for thorough biocuration in the face of widespread quality concerns.",

    "abstract": "Lactobacillus reuteri is a natural inhabitant of selected animal and human gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Certain strains have the capacity to transform glycerol to 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA), further excreted to form reuterin, a potent antimicrobial system. Reuterin-producing strains may be applied as a natural antimicrobial in feed to prevent pathogen colonization of animals, such as in poultry, and replace added antimicrobials. To date, only seven L. reuteri strains isolated from poultry have been characterized which limits phylogenetic studies and host-microbes interactions characterization. This study aimed to isolate L. reuteri strains from poultry GIT and to characterize their reuterin production and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles using phenotypic and genetic methods. Seventy reuterin-producing strains were isolated from poultry crop, faeces and caeca and twenty-five selected for further characterization. Draft genomes were generated for the new 25 isolates and integrated in a phylogenetic tree of 40 strains from different hosts. Phylogenetic analysis based on gene content as well as on core genomes showed grouping of the selected 25 L. reuteri poultry isolates within the poultry/human lineage VI. Strains harbouring pdu-cob-cbi-hem genes (23/25) produced between 156 mM {+/-} 11 and 330 mM {+/-} 14 3-HPA, from 600 mM of glycerol, in the conditions of the test. All 25 poultry strains were sensitive to cefotaxime (MIC between 0.016 and 1 g/mL) and penicillin (MIC between 0.02 and 4 g/mL). Akin to the reference strains DSM20016 and SD2112, the novel isolates were resistant to penicillin, possibly associated with identified point mutations in ponA, pbpX, pbpF and pbpB. All strains resistant to erythromycin (4/27) carried the ermB gene, and it was only present in poultry strains. All strains resistant to tetracycline (5/27) harbored tetW gene. This study confirms the evolutionary history of poultry/human lineage VI and identifies pdu-cob-cbi-hem as a frequent trait but not always present in this lineage. L. reuteri poultry strains producing high 3-HPA yield may have potential to prevent enteropathogen colonization of poultry.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesTo characterise putative AmpC hyper-producing 3rd generation cephalosporin-resistant E. coli from dairy farms and their phylogenetic relationships as well as to identify risk factors for their presence; to assess evidence for their zoonotic transmission into the local human population\\n\\nMethodsProteomics was used to explain differences in antimicrobial susceptibility. Whole genome sequencing allowed phylogenetic analysis. Multilevel, multivariable logistic regression modelling was used to identify risk factors.\\n\\nResultsIncreased use of amoxicillin-clavulanate was associated with an increased risk of finding AmpC hyper-producers on farms. Expansion of cephalosporin resistance in AmpC hyper-producers was seen in farm isolates with marR mutations (conferring cefoperazone resistance) or when AmpC was mutated (conferring 4th generation cephalosporin and cefoperazone resistance). Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the dominance of ST88 amongst farm AmpC hyper-producers but there was no evidence for acquisition of farm isolates by members of the local human population.\\n\\nConclusionsIn this two-year surveillance study of 53 dairy farms, AmpC hyper-production was the cause of cefotaxime resistance in 46.2% of E. coli. There was evidence of recent farm-to-farm transmission and of adaptive mutations to expand resistance. Whilst there was no evidence of isolates entering the local human population, efforts to reduce 3rd generation cephalosporin resistance on dairy farms must address the high prevalence of AmpC hyper-producers. The finding that amoxicillin-clavulanate use was associated with increased risk of finding AmpC hyper-producers is important because this is not currently categorised as a highest-priority critically important antimicrobial and so is not currently targeted for specific usage restrictions in the UK.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPCAPBSTRACTC_SCPCAPBoundaries in the visual world can be defined by changes in luminance and texture in the input image. A \\\"contour integration\\\" process joins together local changes into percepts of lines or edges. A previous study tested the integration of contours defined by second-order contrast-modulation. Their contours were placed in a background of random wavelets. Subjects performed near chance. We re-visited second-order contour integration with a different task. Subjects distinguished contours with \\\"good continuation\\\" from distractors. We measured thresholds in different amounts of external orientation or position noise. This gave two noise-masking functions. We also measured thresholds for contours with a baseline curvature to assess performance with more curvy targets. Our subjects were able to discriminate the good continuation of second-order contours. Thresholds were higher than for first-order contours. In our modelling, we found this was due to multiple factors. There was a doubling of equivalent internal noise between first- and second-order contour integration. There was also a reduction in efficiency. The efficiency difference was only significant in our orientation noise condition. For both first- and second-order stimuli, subjects were also able to perform our task with more curved contours. We conclude that humans can integrate second-order contours, even when they are curved. There is however reduced performance compared to first-order contours. We find both an impaired input to the integrating mechanism, and reduced efficiency seem responsible. Second-order contour integration may be more affected by the noise background used in the previous study. Difficulty segregating that background may explain their result.",

    "abstract": "Achieving a high-quality reconstruction of a phylogenetic tree with branch lengths proportional to absolute time (chronogram) is a difficult and time-consuming task. But the increased availability of fossil and molecular data, and time-efficient analytical techniques has resulted in many recent publications of large chronograms for a large number and wide diversity of organisms. Knowledge of the evolutionary time frame of organisms is key for research in the natural sciences. It also represent valuable information for education, science communication, and policy decisions. When chronograms are shared in public and open databases, this wealth of expertly-curated and peer-reviewed data on evolutionary timeframe is exposed in a programatic and reusable way, as intensive and localized efforts have improved data sharing practices, as well as incentivizited open science in biology. Here we present DateLife, a service implemented as an R package and an R Shiny website application available at www.datelife.org, that provides functionalities for efficient and easy finding, summary, reuse, and reanalysis of expert, peer-reviewed, public data on time frame of evolution. The main DateLife workflow constructs a chronogram for any given combination of taxon names by searching a local chronogram database constructed and curated from the Open Tree of Life Phylesystem phylogenetic database, which incorporates phylogenetic data from the TreeBASE database as well. We implement and test methods for summarizing time data from multiple source chronograms using supertree and congruification algorithms, and using age data extracted from source chronograms as secondary calibration points to add branch lengths proportional to absolute time to a tree topology. DateLife will be useful to increase awareness of the existing variation in alternative hypothesis of evolutionary time for the same organisms, and can foster exploration of the effect of alternative evolutionary timing hypotheses on the results of downstream analyses, providing a framework for a more informed interpretation of evolutionary results.",

The method was verified on a torque-driven pendulum swing-up problem. A different optimal trajectory was found in a stochastic environment than in the deterministic environment.

    "abstract": "MotivationPhosphorylation, which is catalyzed by kinase proteins, is in the top two most common and widely studied types of known essential post-translation protein modification (PTM). Phosphorylation is known to regulate most cellular processes such as protein synthesis, cell division, signal transduction, cell growth, development and aging. Various phosphorylation site prediction models have been developed, which can be broadly categorized as being kinase-specific or non-kinase specific (general). Unlike the latter, the former requires a large enough number of experimentally known phosphorylation sites annotated with a given kinase for training the model, which is not the case in reality: less than 3% of the phosphorylation sites known to date have been annotated with a responsible kinase. To date, there are a few non-kinase specific phosphorylation site prediction models proposed.\\n\\nResultsThis paper proposes SKIPHOS, a non-kinase specific phosphorylation site prediction model based on random forests on top of a continuous distributed representation of amino acids. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset and the independent test set demonstrate that SKIPHOS compares favorably to recent state-of-the-art related methods for three phosphorylation residues. Although being trained on phosphorylation sites in mamals, SKIPHOS can yield predictions for Y residues better than PHOSFER, a recently proposed plants-specific phosphorylation prediction model.\\n\\nAvailability and ImplementationSKIPHOS Web Server is freely available for non-commercial use at http://fit.uet.vnu.edu.vn/SKIPHOS or http://112.137.130.46:5000.\\n\\nContacthai.dang@vnu.edu.vn\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe issue of antimicrobial resistance continues to grow worldwide, and long-term care facilities are significant reservoirs of antimicrobial-resistant organisms, in part due to high frequency of antimicrobial use. Patients with advanced dementia are particularly vulnerable to multidrug-resistant organism acquisition and antimicrobial overuse, which has negative consequences for the gut microbiome and can contribute to the selection and propagation of antimicrobial resistance genes. In this study, we longitudinally examined a group of advanced dementia patients treated with the fluoroquinolone antimicrobial levofloxacin, finding a correlation between abundance of pathogens and antimicrobial resistance genes, which we confirmed in a larger cohort of subjects with advanced dementia.\\n\\nResultsWe observed significant inter- and intra-subject heterogeneity in the composition of the microbiota of the longitudinal levofloxacin cohort, suggesting temporal instability. Within this dataset, we did not find significant impacts of levofloxacin on the diversity, composition, function, or resistome of the gut microbiota of this population. However, we were able to link the antimicrobial resistance gene burden in a sample with the relative abundance of several pathobionts - particularly Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterococcus faecalis, as well as less-prevalent species including Providencia stuartii and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Furthermore, we used metagenomic assembly and binning to demonstrate that these species had higher genomic resistance gene levels than common gut commensals, and we were able to predict antimicrobial resistance gene burden from the relative abundances of these species in a separate, larger cohort from the same population.\\n\\nConclusionsWe found that the relative abundances of several pathobionts were correlated with and were even predictive of the level of antimicrobial resistance genes in corresponding samples, and that these species carried high levels of resistances genes in their assembled genomes. In order to test this observation, we utilized a larger metagenomics dataset from a similar population and confirmed the association between pathobiont abundance and antimicrobial resistance genes. Given the high frequency with which these species were found at high levels in this population and the underlying vulnerability to infection with multidrug resistant organisms of advanced dementia patients, attention to microbial blooms of these species may be warranted. Additionally, in this study, we were able to utilize genomic assembly from metagenomic data to more definitively associate antimicrobial resistance gene levels with specific assembled species; as this technology continues to develop, assembly could prove to be a valuable method to monitor both specific resistance genes and blooms of multidrug-resistant organisms.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastomas are among the most lethal cancers, with a five year survival rate below 25%. Temozolomide is typically used in glioblastoma treatment; however, the enzymes APNG and MGMT efficiently mediate the repair of DNA damage caused by temozolomide, reducing treatment efficacy. Consequently, APNG and MGMT inhibition has been proposed as a way of overcoming chemotherapy resistance. Here, we develop a mechanistic mathematical model that explicitly incorporates the effect of chemotherapy on tumor cells, including the processes of DNA damage induction, cell arrest and DNA repair. Our model is carefully parameterized and validated, and then used to virtually recreate the response of heteroclonal glioblastoma to dual treatment with TMZ and inhibitors of APNG/MGMT. Using our mechanistic model, we identify four combination treatment strategies optimized by tumor cell phenotype, and isolate the strategy most likely to succeed in a pre-clinical and clinical setting. If confirmed in clinical trials, these strategies have the potential to offset chemotherapy resistance in glioblastoma patients, and improve overall survival.",

    "abstract": "The canonical beating of the human sperm flagellum is postulated to be symmetric. This is despite the reported asymmetries inherent to the flagellar axonemal structure, from distribution and activation of molecular motors to, even, the localisation of regulatory ion channels. This raises a fundamental question: how symmetric beating is possible within such intrinsically asymmetric flagellar complex? Here, we employ high-speed 3D imaging with mathematical analysis capable of resolving the flagellar movement in 4D (3D+time). This reveals that the human sperm beating is both anisotropic and asymmetric, and composed by a superposition of two transversal waves: an asymmetric travelling wave and a symmetric standing wave. This novel anisotropic travelling-pulsation mechanism induces sperm rolling self-organisation and causes a flagellar kinematic illusion, so that the beat appears to be symmetric if observed with 2D microscopy. The 3D beating anisotropy thus regularises the intrinsic flagellar asymmetry to achieve symmetric side-to-side movement and straight-line swimming.",

    "abstract": "Intrahepatic macrophages influence the composition of the microenvironment, host immune response to liver injury, and development of fibrosis. Compared to stellate cells, the role of intrahepatic macrophages in the development of fibrosis remains ill defined. Multispectral imaging allows detection of multiple markers in situ in human formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. This cutting-edge technology is ideal for analyzing human liver tissues since it allows spectral unmixing of fluorophore signals, subtraction of auto-fluorescence, and preserves architecture and the in vivo hepatic milieu. We analyzed resident Kupffer cells (CD68+), monocyte-derived macrophages (Mac387+), pro-fibrogenic macrophages (CD163+), and co-expression of pro-inflammatory (CD14) and anti-inflammatory (CD16) markers in liver biopsies from patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and different stages of fibrosis. Liver biopsies with advanced fibrosis showed increased accumulation of CD163+, MAC387+ and CD68+ macrophages in the portal tracts when compared to those with minimal fibrosis. Imaging software generated t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) plots and phenotype matrices that facilitated comparison of macrophage profiles. These included monocyte-derived (CD68+/Mac387+) and pro-fibrotic/anti-inflammatory (CD163+/CD16+) phenotypes. We established that the utility of this platform could be extended to liver biopsies from patients with other chronic liver diseases including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and autoimmune hepatitis. Each disease exhibited a unique profile after spectral imaging analysis and this platform holds the potential to identify patients predisposed to progressive liver disease based on the macrophage composition. In summary, spectral imaging is a powerful tool that enables analysis of macrophage profiles in different types of chronic liver diseases and has potential to change the manner in which we evaluate liver biopsies leading to more personalized treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "Cytosolic mRNA translation is subject to global and mRNA-specific controls. Phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2 anchors a reversible switch that represses translation globally. The stress-responsive GCN2 kinase is the only known kinase for eIF2 in Arabidopsis. Here we show that conditions that generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the chloroplast, such as dark-light transitions, high light, and the herbicide methyl viologen all rapidly activated the GCN2 kinase, whereas mitochondrial and ER stress did not. In addition, GCN2 activation was light dependent and mitigated by photosynthesis inhibitors and ROS quenchers. Accordingly, seedling growth of multiple gcn2 mutant alleles was retarded under conditions of excess light, implicating the GCN2-eIF2 pathway in responses to light and associated ROS. Once activated, the GCN2 kinase preferentially suppressed the ribosome loading of mRNAs for functions such as mitochondrial ATP synthesis, the chloroplast thylakoids, vesicle trafficking, and translation. The transcriptome of gcn2 mutants was sensitized to abiotic stress, including oxidative stress, as well as innate immune responses. Accordingly, gcn2 displayed defects in immune priming by the fungal elicitor, chitin. In conclusion, we provide evidence that reactive oxygen species produced by the photosynthetic apparatus help to activate the highly conserved GCN2 kinase, leading to eIF2 phosphorylation and thus affecting the status of the cytosolic protein synthesis apparatus.",
