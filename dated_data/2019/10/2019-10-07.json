    "abstract": "The pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1{beta} and IL-18 are products of activation of the inflammasome, an innate sensing system, and important in the pathogenesis of herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1). The release of IL-18 and IL-1{beta} from monocytes/macrophages is critical for protection from HSV-1 based on animal models of encephalitis and genital infection, yet if and how HSV-1 activates inflammasomes in human macrophages is unknown. To investigate this, we utilized both primary human monocyte derived macrophages and human monocytic cell lines (THP-1 cells) with various inflammasome components knocked-out. We found that HSV-1 activates inflammasome signaling in pro-inflammatory primary human macrophages. Additionally, HSV-1 inflammasome activation is dependent on nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing receptor 3 (NLRP3), apoptosis-associated speck-like molecule containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), and caspase-1, but not on absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), or gamma interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI16). Ultraviolet irradiation of HSV-1 enhanced inflammasome activation, demonstrating that viral replication suppresses inflammasome activation. These results confirm that HSV-1 is capable of activating the inflammasome in human macrophages through an NLRP3 dependent process and that the virus has an NLRP3 specific mechanism to inhibit inflammasome activation in monocytes and macrophages.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe inflammasome is a multi-protein complex that forms in response to pathogens and cellular damage. Active inflammasomes recruit pro-caspase-1 via ASC and cleave the cytokine precursors pro-IL-1{beta} and pro-IL-18 into mature IL-1{beta} and IL-18. These cytokines serve to activate other immune cells that either repair the damage or attempt to clear the invading pathogen. Upon activation, the inflammasome also promotes an inflammatory form of cell death called pyroptosis. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a common human pathogen that can cause cold sores, genital ulcers, encephalitis, and blindness. HSV-1 infection leads to induction of IL-1{beta} and IL-18, but whether it is capable of activating inflammasomes in macrophages, which play a role in severe forms of HSV-1 infection, was unclear. Here, we infected both primary human macrophages and a macrophage/monocytic cell line, THP-1 cells, with HSV-1. We found that HSV-1 does activate inflammasome signaling in macrophages in a process dependent on NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1. This is important because it illustrates the mechanism by which HSV-1 infection leads to inflammasome activation in macrophages, known to be crucial for protection from severe disease in mouse models.",

    "abstract": "The mechanism which adapts the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) within a given major histocompatibility complex (MHC/HLA) genotype is essential for protection against pathogens. Historically attributed to relative affinity, genetically vast TCRs are surprisingly focused towards a micromolar affinity for their respective peptide (p) plus MHC (pMHC) ligands. Thus, the somatic diversity of the TCR with respect to MHC-restriction, and (ultimately) to pathogens, remains enigmatic. Here, we derive a triple integral solution (from fixed geometry) for any given V domain in TCR bound to pMHC. Solved complexes involving HLA-DR and HLA-DQ, where genetic linkage to the TCR is most profound, were examined in detail. Certain V domains displayed rare geometry within this panel--specifying a restricted rotational probability/volumetric density (dV). Remarkably, hydrogen (H) bond charge-relays distinguished these structures from the others; suggesting that CDR3 binding chemistry dictates CDR2 contacts on the opposite MHC-II alpha helix. Together, these data suggest that TCR recapitulate dV and specialise target pMHC recognition.",

    "abstract": "The homodimer formed by the protein S100A9 induces inflammation through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), playing critical roles in both healthy and pathological innate immune responses. The molecular mechanism by which S100A9 activates TLR4 remains unknown. Previously, the interaction between purified S100A9 and TLR4 was shown to depend on Zn2+; however, the Zn2+ binding site(s) on S100A9 were not identified. Here, we investigated the role of Zn2+ binding in the pro-inflammatory activity of S100A9. We found that the S100A9 homodimer was prone to reversible, Zn2+-dependent aggregation in vitro. Using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC), we identified multiple residues that contribute to Zn2+ binding in S100A9. We then used mutagenesis to construct a version of S100A9 with no detectable Zn2+ binding by either ITC or Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry. This protein did not exhibit aggregation upon addition of saturating Zn2+. Further, despite the lack of Zn2+-binding, this protein was capable of activating TLR4 in a cell-based functional assay. We then modified the functional assay so the Zn2+ concentration was exceedingly low relative to the concentration of S100A9 added. Again, S100A9 was able to activate TLR4. This reveals that, despite the ability of S100A9 to bind Zn2+, S100A9 does not require Zn2+ to activate TLR4. Our work represents an important step in clarifying the nature of the interaction between S100A9 and TLR4.",

    "abstract": "Searching for informative indices indicating cancer type and cause of the disease is of great importance. Here we tried to identify those indices from the data of complete blood analysis, only. We studied the inhomogeneity in the mutual distribution of a number of oncology patients with various types of tumors in the space of qualitative data provided by the complete blood count. The patients with oncology in hematology system were excluded. Ultimate goal is to reveal the relation between such inhomogeneity issues and the cause of a disease. We used the database on complete blood count comprising oncology patients with various causes of tumor development. The analysis has been carried out both by linear (K-means) and non-linear (elastic map technique) methods. No linear clustering has been found. On the contrary, elastic map technique yields stable clustering identifying not less than three clusters, in the set of patients. No relation of those clusters to sex or age of patients has been found. Four indices (namely, BAS, EOS, WBC and IG) exhibit no relation to the cluster structure, while all others do it. Thus, the patients are stratified according to their respond on the stress caused by cancer tumor. The data on complete blood count may be used for preliminary diagnostics of a tumor and its cause, for oncology patients. This type of analysis is cheap, standard and available at any medical organization.",

    "abstract": "Mechanistic portrayals of how animals form and maintain territories remain rare, and as a discipline, collective movement ecology has tended to focus on synergistic (e.g., migration, shoaling) rather than agonistic or territorial interactions. Here we ask how dynamic territory formation and maintenance might contribute to disease dynamics in an asocial territorial animal for an indirectly transmitted pathogen. We developed a mechanistic individual-based model where stigmergy--the deposition of signals into the environment (e.g., scent marking, scraping)--dictates not only local movement choices and long-term territory formation, but also the risk of pathogen transmission. Based on a variable importance analysis, the length of the infectious period was the single most important variable in predicting outbreak success, maximum prevalence, and outbreak duration. Population size and rate of pathogen decay were also key predictors. We found that territoriality best reduced maximum prevalence in conditions where we would otherwise expect outbreaks to be most successful: slower recovery rates (i.e., longer infectious periods) and higher conspecific densities. However, at high enough densities, outbreak duration became considerably more variable. Our findings therefore support a limited version of the \\\"territoriality benefits\\\" hypothesis--where reduced home range overlap leads to reduced opportunities for pathogen transmission, but with the caveat that reduction in outbreak severity may increase the likelihood of pathogen persistence. For longer infectious periods and higher host densities, key trade-offs emerged between the strength of pathogen load, strength of the stigmergy cue, and the rate at which those two quantities decayed; this finding raises interesting questions about the evolutionary nature of these competing processes and the role of possible feedbacks between parasitism and territoriality. This work also highlights the importance of considering social cues as part of the movement landscape in order to improve our understanding of the consequences of individual behaviors on population level outcomes.\\n\\nAuthor summaryMaking decisions about conservation and disease management relies on our understanding of what allows animal populations to be successful. However, movement ecology, as a field, tends to focus on how animals respond to their abiotic environment. Similarly, disease ecology often focuses on the social behavior of animals without accounting for their individual movement patterns. We developed a simulation model that bridges these two fields by allowing hosts to inform their movement based on the past trajectories of other hosts. As hosts navigate their environment, they leave behind a scent trail while avoiding the scent trails of other individuals. We wanted to know if this means of territory formation could heighten or dampen disease spread when infectious hosts leave pathogens in their wake. We found that territoriality could inhibit disease spread under conditions that we would normally expect pathogens to be most successful: where there are many hosts on the landscape and hosts stay infectious for longer. This work points to how incorporating movement behavior into disease models can provide improved understanding of how diseases spread in wildlife populations; such understanding is particularly important in the face of combatting ongoing and emerging infectious diseases.",

Here, we report the characterization of an endofungal bacterium Serratia marcescens D1 from Mucor irregularis SS7 hyphae. Upon re-inoculation, colonization of the endobacterium S. marcescens D1 in the hyphae of Mucor irregularis SS7 was demonstrated using stereo microscopy. However, S. marcescens D1 failed to invade into the hyphae of the tested Ascomycetes (except Fusarium oxysporum) and Basidiomycetes. Remarkably, Serratia marcescens D1 could invade and spread over the culture of F. oxysporum that resulted in mycelial death. Prodigiosin, the red pigment produced by the Serratia marcescens D1, helps the bacterium to invade fungal hyphae as revealed by the increasing permeability in fungal cell membrane. On the other hand, genes encoding the type VI secretion system (T6SS) assembly protein TssJ and an outer membrane associated murein lipoprotein also showed significant up-regulation during the interaction process, suggesting the involvement of T6SS in the invasion process.",

    "abstract": "Horizontal gene transfer, mediated by conjugative plasmids, is a major driver of the global spread of antibiotic resistance. However, the relative contributions of factors that underlie the spread of clinically relevant plasmids are unclear. Here, we quantified conjugative transfer dynamics of Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) producing plasmids in the absence of antibiotics. We showed that clinical Escherichia coli strains natively associated with ESBL-plasmids conjugate efficiently with three distinct E. coli strains and one Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain, reaching final transconjugant frequencies of up to 1% within 24 hours in vitro. The variation of final transconjugant frequencies varied among plasmids, donors and recipients and was better explained by variation in conjugative transfer efficiency than by variable clonal expansion. We identified plasmid-specific genetic factors, specifically the presence/absence of transfer genes, that influenced final transconjugant frequencies. Finally, we investigated plasmid spread within the mouse intestine, demonstrating qualitative agreement between plasmid spread in vitro and in vivo. This suggests a potential for the prediction of plasmid spread in the gut of animals and humans, based on in vitro testing. Altogether, this may allow the identification of resistance plasmids with high spreading potential and help to devise appropriate measures to restrict their spread.",

    "abstract": "There have been relatively few studies of how central synapses age in adult Drosophila melanogaster. In this study we investigate the aging of the synaptic inputs to the Giant Fiber (GF) from the Johnstons Organ neurons (JONs). In previously published experiments an indirect assay of this synaptic connection was used; here we describe a new, more direct assay, which allows reliable detection of the GF action potential in the neck connective, and long term recording of its responses to sound. Genetic ablation using diphtheria toxin expressed in the GF with R68A06-GAL4 was used to show that these signals indeed arose from the GF and not from other descending neurons. As before, the sound-evoked action potentials (SEPs) in the antennal nerve were recorded via an electrode inserted at the base of the antenna. We then used this technique to quantify the response of the JONs to a high frequency sound pulse, and also the strength of the JON-GF synapse, in males and female of different ages. At no age was there any significant difference between males and females, for any of the parameters measured. Sensitivity of the JONs increased between 1 d and 10 d, with the sound intensity that elicited a half-maximal SEP decreasing by 40%. This measure almost doubled by 20 d and had increased 3-fold by 50 d compared to 10 d. Thus, JONs are most responsive around the period when most matings are taking place. The strength of the JON-GF synaptic connection itself was quite variable and did not change significantly with age. As a result, the GFs sensitivity to sound approximately followed the JONs sensitivity, but with greater variability.",

    "abstract": "Disturbance forces facilitate motor learning, but theoretical explanations for this counterintuitive phenomenon are lacking. Smooth arm movements require predictions (inference) about the force-field associated with a workspace. The Free Energy Principle (FEP) suggests that such  active inference is driven by  surprise. We used these insights to create a formal model that explains why disturbance helps learning. In two experiments, participants undertook a continuous tracking task where they learned how to move their arm in different directions through a novel 3D force field. We compared baseline performance before and after exposure to the novel field to quantify learning. In Experiment 1, the exposure phases (but not the baseline measures) were delivered under three different conditions: (i) robot haptic assistance; (ii) no guidance; (iii) robot haptic disturbance. The disturbance group showed the best learning as our model predicted. Experiment 2 further tested our FEP inspired model. Assistive and/or disturbance forces were applied as a function of performance (low surprise), and compared to a random error manipulation (high surprise). The random group showed the most improvement as predicted by the model. Thus, motor learning can be conceptualised as a process of entropy reduction. Short term motor strategies (e.g. global impedance) can mitigate unexpected perturbations, but continuous movements require active inference about external force-fields in order to create accurate internal models of the external world (motor learning). Our findings reconcile research on the relationship between noise, variability, and motor learning, and show that information is the currency of motor learning.",

The present study is the first recorded traditional knowledge of grasses and feeding system for livestock from the Thal desert in Pakistan. Snowball method was used to identify key informants. Information was collected from 232 informants from six districts of Thal Desert through semi-structural questionnaire and site visits. The data was analyzed through Smiths salience index and Composite Salience using ANTHROPAC package in R software. On the whole 61 grasses were recorded from the study area and most of the species belongs to the Poaceae family (52 species). Based on palatability grasses were categorized into three major groups i.e. (A) High priority, (B) Medium priority and (C) Low priority. Species in Group A, abundantly present in the study area, highly palatable forage for all ruminants. 232(141M +91W) local informants were interviewed. Informants were grouped into three major age categories: 20-35 (48 informants), 36-50 (116 informants) and 51-67 years (68 informants). ANTHROPAC frequency analysis conformed the Smiths salience index and Composite Salience; Cynodon dactylon was the favorite species (6.46 SI, 0.6460 CS) followed by Cymbopogon jwarancusa (5.133 SI, 0.5133 CS) and Sorghum sp. was the third most salient species (5.121 SI, 0.5121 CS). Grasses were mostly available during the season of August and October and had also ethnoveterinary importance. This document about the traditional feeding of livestock from Thal Desert can strengthen the value of conserving our traditional knowledge, which was poorly documented before.",

    "abstract": "The increase in worlds population will cause a high demand of animal-sourced food, which will require a boost in the production of protein, because protein is an important component of animal feed. A higher production of protein, however, might contribute for the depletion of environmental resources. In this scenario, the use of insects as an alternative source of protein to feed animals could be a solution. However, citizens willingness-to-accept insect as a source of protein to feed animals is unknown, particularly in developing countries, such as Brazil. The aim of this study was to investigate the factors influencing citizens willingness-to-accept the use of insects to feed poultry, cattle, pig and fish. To reach this aim, we conducted an online survey with Brazilian citizens. We analyzed the data using descriptive statistics and four logistic regression models. In each of logistic models, the dependent variable was citizens willingness-to-accept the use of insects to feed either poultry, or cattle, or pig or fish. A set of independent variables including socio-demographic characteristics, attitudes, perceived benefits, perceived risks, and perceived concerns were used to explain citizens' willingness-to-accept the use of insect to feed animals. Results showed that most citizens would accept that poultry, pig, and fish receive insect-based diets, and half of the citizens would accept and half would not accept that cattle receive such diet. Results of the logistic regression models showed that citizens who had a positive attitude about using insects to feed animals were more willing-to-accept the use of insect to feed poultry, cattle, pig, and fish compared to those who had a negative attitude. Citizens who perceived the benefits of using insect to feed animals were less willing-to-accept the use of insects to feed poultry compared to those who didnt perceive the benefits. Citizens who perceived the benefits of using insects to feed animals were more willing-to-accept the use of insect to feed fish compared to those who didnt perceive the benefits. Citizens who were more concerned about using insect to feed animals were more willing-to-accept the use of insects to feed poultry compared to those who were less concerned. Finally, citizens who were more concerned about using insects to feed animals were less willing-to-accept the use of insect to feed pigs compared to those who were less concerned. These results revealed important insights that can be used to design strategies to increase the acceptance of the use of insects to feed poultry, cattle, pig, and fish.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesLiterature shows a high prevalence of MetS among Malaysians, varying across major ethnicities. As sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle factors and diet habits of such communities have been reported to be diverse, the study objective was to investigate the association of various sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle factors and diet habits on MetS overall and among the three major ethnic communities in Malaysia.\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study among 481 Malaysians of age 18 years and above living in Johor, Malaysia. Information on demographics, lifestyle and diet habits was collected using a structured questionnaire. MetS was diagnosed among the subjects using the Harmonized criteria. Multiple logistic regression was used to analyse associations between sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and dietary behaviours with MetS.\\n\\nResultsMetS was found among 32.2% of the respondents, more prevalent among the Indians (51.9%), followed by Malays (36.7%) and Chinese (20.2%). Overall, increasing age (AOR=2.44[95%CI=1.27-4.70] at 40-49 years vs. AOR=4.14[95%CI=1.97-8.69] at 60 years and above) and Indian ethnicity (AOR=1.95[95%CI=1.12-3.38)] increased, while higher education (AOR = 0.44[95%CI = 0.20-0.94] reduced the odds of MetS in this population. Quick finishing of meals (AOR=2.17[95%CI=1.02-4.60]) and low physical activity (AOR=4.76[95%CI=1.49-15.26]) was associated with an increased odds of MetS among the Malays and Chinese, respectively.\\n\\nConclusionThe population in Johor is diverse in these factors, and some of these are associated with MetS in certain ethnicities. In light of such differences, ethnic specific measures are needed to reduce the prevalence of MetS in this population.",

    "abstract": "Livestock manure is an important way that antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) can enter the environment, and composting is an effective method for removing ARGs from livestock manure. In this study, different volume ratios of Chinese medicinal herbal residues (CMHRs) were added to laboratory-scale chicken manure composting to evaluate their effects on the behavior of ARGs, mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and the bacterial community. At the end of the composting period, the structure of the microbial community changed. Firmicutes decreased and Bacteroidetes increased. The relative abundance of the 21 ARGs and 5 MGEs detected decreased by varying degrees in the different treatments (except for sulI and intI1). The removal rate of the ARGs increased with the increased addition of CMHRs. The correlations between transferase genes (tnpA and tnpA-02) and ARGs were significant (p < 0.05); therefore, transposon plays an important role in the horizontal gene transfer of ARGs in chicken manure. The results imply that CMHRs would be an effective bulking agent for the removal of ARGs from chicken manure composting.",

    "abstract": "De facto marine protected areas (DFMPAs) are regions of the ocean where human activity is restricted for reasons other than conservation. Although DFMPAs are widespread globally, their potential role in the protection of marine habitats, species, and ecosystems has not been well studied. In 2012 and 2013, we conducted remotely operated vehicle (ROV) surveys of marine communities at a military DFMPA and an adjacent fished reference site at San Clemente Island, the southernmost of Californias Channel Islands. We used data extracted from ROV imagery to compare density and biomass of focal species, as well as biodiversity and community composition, between the two sites. Generalized linear modeling indicated that both density and biomass of California sheephead (Semicossyphus pulcher) were significantly higher inside the DFMPA. Biomass of ocean whitefish (Caulolatilus princeps) was also significantly higher inside the DFMPA. However, species richness and Shannon-Weaver diversity were not significantly higher inside the DFMPA, and overall fish community composition did not differ significantly between sites. Demonstrable differences between the DFMPA and fished site for two highly sought-after species hint at early potential benefits of protection, though the lack of differences in the broader community suggests that a longer trajectory of recovery may be required for other species. A more comprehensive understanding of the potential conservation benefits of DFMPAs is important in the context of marine spatial planning and global marine conservation objectives.",

    "abstract": "PurposeTo investigate the changes in extracellular matrix (ECM) gene and protein expressions in human trabecular meshwork (HTM) cells in response to mechanical fluid flow stimulation.\\n\\nMethodsHTM cells were cultured on a glass plate and exposed to shear stress (0, 0.2, and 1.0 dyne/cm2) for 12 hours. Changes in gene expressions were evaluated using microarray analysis. The representative genes related to ECM metabolism underwent real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Fibronectin (FN) and collagen (COL) IV levels in the supernatant were evaluated using immunoassays. Rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase (ROCK) activity also was investigated.\\n\\nResultsAfter stimulation, transforming growth factor {beta}2 mRNA levels were significantly (p < 0.01) lower than that of the static control (0 dyne/cm2 for 12 hours). Matrix metalloproteinase 2 mRNA levels were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the static control. COL type 1 alpha 2 mRNA, COL type 4 alpha 2 mRNA, and COL type 6 alpha 1 mRNA levels were significantly (p < 0.05, < 0.01, and < 0.05, respectively) higher than the static control. The mean {+/-} standard deviation FN levels (ng/mL) in the supernatant after stimulation (0, 0.2, 1.0 dyne/cm2) were 193.7 {+/-} 7.6, 51.5 {+/-} 21.8, and 34.9 {+/-} 23.6, respectively (p < 0.01). The FN and COL IV levels and ROCK activity were significantly (p < 0.01 and < 0.05, respectively) lower than the static control.\\n\\nConclusionsChanges in gene and protein expressions related to ECM metabolism occurred in HTM cells after stimulation. Specifically, the suppression of FN and COL IV production might explain the importance of mechanical fluid flow stimulation on maintenance of the normal aqueous humor outflow.",

    "abstract": "In flowering plants, the haploid male gametophyte (pollen) is essential for sperm delivery, double fertilization, and subsequent initiation of seed development. Pollen also undergoes dynamic epigenetic regulation of expression from transposable elements (TEs), but how this process interacts with gene regulation and function is not clearly understood. To identify components of these processes, we quantified transcript levels in four male reproductive stages of maize (tassel primordia, microspores, mature pollen, and isolated sperm cells) via RNA-seq. We found that, in contrast to Arabidopsis TE expression in pollen, TE transcripts in maize accumulate as early as the microspore stage and are also present in sperm cells. Intriguingly, coordinated expression was observed between the most highly expressed protein-coding genes and neighboring TEs, specifically in both mature pollen and sperm cells. To test the hypothesis that such elevated expression correlates with functional relevance, we measured the fitness cost (male-specific transmission defect) of GFP-tagged exon insertion mutations in over 50 genes highly expressed in pollen vegetative cell, sperm cell, or seedling (as a sporophytic control). Insertions in genes highly expressed only in seedling or primarily in sperm cells (with one exception) exhibited no difference from the expected 1:1 transmission ratio. In contrast, insertions in over 20% of vegetative cell genes were associated with significant reductions in fitness, showing a positive correlation of transcript level with non-Mendelian segregation. The gamete expressed2 (gex2) gene was the single sperm cell gene associated with reduced transmission when mutant (<35% for two independent insertions), and also triggered seed defects when crossed as a male, supporting a role for gex2 in double fertilization. Overall, our study demonstrates a developmentally programmed and coordinated transcriptional activation of TEs and genes, and further identifies maize pollen as a model in which transcriptomic data have predictive value for quantitative phenotypes.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryIn flowering plants, pollen is essential for delivering sperm cells to the egg and central cell for double fertilization, initiating the process of seed development. In plants with abundant pollen like maize, this process can be highly competitive. In an added layer of complexity, growing evidence indicates expression of transposable elements (TEs) is more dynamic in pollen than in other plant tissues. How these elements impact pollen function and gene regulation is not well understood. We used transcriptional profiling to generate a framework for both detailed analysis of TE expression and quantitative assessment of gene function during maize pollen development. TEs are expressed early and persist, many showing coordinate activation with highly-expressed neighboring genes in the pollen vegetative cell and sperm cells. Measuring fitness costs for a set of over 50 mutations indicates a correlation between elevated transcript level and gene function in the vegetative cell. Finally, we establish a role in fertilization for the gamete expressed2 (gex2) gene, identified based on its specific expression in sperm cells. These results highlight maize pollen as a powerful model for investigating the developmental interplay of TEs and genes, as well as for measuring fitness contributions of specific genes.",
