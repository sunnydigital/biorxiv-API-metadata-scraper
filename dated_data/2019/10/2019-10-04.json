    "abstract": "Maternal immune activation increases the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. Elevated cytokines, such as interferon-gamma (IFN{gamma}), in offsprings brains play a central role. IFN{gamma} activates an antiviral cellular state, limiting viral entry and replication. In addition, IFN{gamma} has been implicated in brain development. Here, we hypothesise that IFN{gamma}-induced antiviral signalling contributes to molecular and cellular phenotypes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. We find that transient IFN{gamma} treatment of neural progenitors derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSCs) persistently increases neurite outgrowth, phenocopying hIPSC-neurons from autistic individuals. IFN{gamma} upregulates antiviral PML bodies and MHC class I (MHCI) genes, which persists through neuronal differentiation. Critically, IFN{gamma}-induced neurite outgrowth requires both PML and MHCI. We also find that IFN{gamma} disproportionately alters expression of autism and schizophrenia risk genes, suggesting convergence between these genetic and environmental risk factors. Together, these data indicate that IFN{gamma}-induced antiviral signalling may contribute to neurodevelopmental disorder aetiology.",

    "abstract": "How humans execute accurate movement in the presence of motor noise is a key problem in the field of biomechanics and motor control that limits the performance improvement in daily or sporting activities. The aim of this study was to clarify the strategy of basketball players during free-throw shooting. Two possible hypotheses were examined: the players minimize the release speed to decrease signal-dependent noise or the players maximize the shot success probability by accounting for their variability. Eight collegiate players and one professional player participated in this study by attempting shots from the free-throw line using a motion capture system. The solution manifold consisting of ball parameters at release was calculated and the optimal strategy was simulated by considering ball parameter variability; this result was compared with the actual data. Our results showed that participants selected the solution of near-minimum release speed. The deviation of the measured release angle from the minimum-speed angle was close to zero (2.8 {+/-} 3.1{degrees}). However, an increase in speed-dependent noise did not have a significant influence on the ball landing position through simulation. Additionally, the effect of release angle error on the ball landing position was minimum when using the minimum speed strategy. Therefore, the players minimize the release speed to minimize the effect of the release error on performance, instead of minimizing the speed-dependent noise itself. In other words, the strategy is \\\"near-minimum-speed strategy\\\" as well as \\\"minimum-error-propagation strategy\\\". These findings will be important for understanding how sports experts deal with intrinsic noise to improve performance.",

    "abstract": "Substantive changes in gene expression, metabolism, and the proteome are manifested in overall changes in microbial population growth. Quantifying how microbes grow is therefore fundamental to areas such as genetics, bioengineering, and food safety. Traditional parametric growth curve models capture the population growth behavior through a set of summarizing parameters. However, estimation of these parameters from data is confounded by random effects such as experimental variability, batch effects or differences in experimental material. A systematic statistical method to identify and correct for such confounding effects in population growth data is not currently available. Further, our previous work has demonstrated that parametric models are insufficient to explain and predict microbial response under non-standard growth conditions. Here we develop a hierarchical Bayesian non-parametric model of population growth that identifies the latent growth behavior and response to perturbation, while simultaneously correcting for random effects in the data. This model enables more accurate estimates of the biological effect of interest, while better accounting for the uncertainty due to technical variation. Additionally, modeling hierarchical variation provides estimates of the relative impact of various confounding effects on measured population growth.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) enable 3-dimensional (3-D) imaging of cardiac architecture and mechanics in toto. However, segmentation of the cardiac trabecular network to quantify cardiac injury remains a challenge. We hereby employed \\\"subspace approximation with augmented kernels (Saak) transform\\\" for accurate and efficient quantification of the light-sheet image stacks following chemotherapy-treatment. We established a machine learning framework with augmented kernels based on the Karhunen-Loeve Transform (KLT) to preserve linearity and reversibility of rectification. The Saak transform-based machine learning enhances computational efficiency and obviates iterative optimization of cost function needed for neural networks, minimizing the number of training data sets to three 2-D slices for segmentation in our scenario. The integration of forward and inverse Saak transforms serves as a light-weight module to filter adversarial perturbations and reconstruct estimated images, salvaging robustness of existing classification methods. The accuracy and robustness of the Saak transform are evident following the tests of dice similarity coefficients and various adversary perturbation algorithms, respectively. The addition of edge detection further allows for quantifying the surface area to volume ratio (SVR) of the myocardium in response to chemotherapy-induced cardiac remodeling. The combination of Saak transform, random forest, and edge detection augments segmentation efficiency by 20-fold as compared to manual processing; thus, establishing a robust framework for post light-sheet imaging processing, creating a data-driven machine learning for 3-D quantification of cardiac ultra-structure.",

    "abstract": "Developmental processes require strict regulation of proliferation, differentiation and patterning for the generation of final organ size. Aberrations in these fundamental events are critically important in understanding tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Salt inducible kinases (Siks) are evolutionarily conserved genes involved in diverse biological processes, including salt sensing, metabolism, muscle and skeletal development. Recent findings implicate SIKs in tumor suppression or progression. However, their role in development remains largely unknown.\\n\\nUsing a sensitized tumor model in the Drosophila eye, we show that perturbations of Sik function exacerbates tumor-like tissue overgrowth and metastasis. Furthermore, we show that both Drosophila Sik genes, Sik2 and Sik3, are required for proper eye development. We propose that an important target of Siks may be the Notch pathway, as we demonstrate epistasis between Siks and Notch pathway members and identify putative phosphorylation motifs on Notch, Delta and Fringe. Finally, we investigate Sik expression in the developing retina and show that Sik2 is expressed in all photoreceptors in close proximity to cell junctions, while Sik3 appears to be expressed specifically in R3/R4 cells in the developing eye. Combined, our data suggest that Sik genes are important in tissue specification, growth, and that their dysregulation may contribute to tumor formation.",

    "abstract": "During multicellular organization, individual cells need to constantly respond to environmental cues and adjust contractile and adhesive forces in order to maintain tissue integrity. The signaling pathways linking biochemical cues and tissue mechanics are unclear. Here, we show that Plexin-B2 regulates mechanochemical integration during multicellular organization. In human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), Plexin-B2 controls cell shape and tissue geometry in both 2D epithelial colony and 3D spheroid aggregates by regulating actomyosin contractility and junctional/cell-matrix adhesive properties. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) directly demonstrates that Plexin-B2 modulates cell stiffness in hESC colonies, which in turn impacts cell proliferation and cell fate specification through {beta}-catenin signaling and YAP mechanosensing. YAP also functions as a mechanoregulator downstream of Plexin-B2, thus forming a mechanochemical integrative loop. In human neuroprogenitor cells (hNPCs), Plexin-B2 similarly controls cell stiffness and tensile forces, as revealed by AFM and FRET tension sensor studies. Strikingly, Plexin-B2-deficient hNPCs display accelerated neuronal differentiation. From an organogenesis perspective, Plexin-B2 maintains cytoarchitectural integrity of neuroepithelium, as modeled in cerebral organoids. On a signaling level, Plexin-B2 engages extracellular as well as intracellular Ras-GAP and RBD domains for mechanoregulation through Rap and Rac GTPases. Our data unveil a fundamental function of Plexin-B2 for mechanochemical integration during multicellular organization, and shed light on the principle of force-mediated regulation of stem cell biology and tissue morphogenesis.",

Genetic information can improve drug discovery rates by facilitating the identification of novel biological targets and potential drugs for repurposing.\n\nMethodsThe present study utilized a recently developed Bayesian approach, Integrative Risk Gene Selector (iRIGS), to identify additional risk genes for alcohol consumption using SNPs from the largest alcohol consumption GWAS to date (N = 941,280). iRIGS incorporates several genomic features and closeness of these genes in network space to compute a posterior probability for protein coding genes near each SNP. We subsequently used the Target Central Resource Database to search for drug-protein interactions for these newly identified genes and previously identified risk genes for alcohol consumption.\n\nResultsWe identified several genes that are novel contributions to the previously published alcohol consumption GWAS. Namely, ACVR2A, which is critical for liver function and linked to anxiety and cocaine self-administration, and PRKCE, which has been linked to alcohol self-administration. Notably, only a minority of the SNPs (18.4%) were linked to genes with confidence ([&ge;].75), underscoring the need to apply multiple methods to assign function to loci. Finally, several previously identified risk genes for alcohol consumption code for proteins that are implicated in liver function and are targeted by drugs that are promising candidates for managing hepatotoxicity (e.g., metformin).\n\nConclusionsThis study demonstrates the value of incorporating regulatory information and drug-protein interaction data to highlight additional molecular targets and drug repurposing candidates for treating AUD and ALD.",

    "abstract": "During meiosis, the recombination-initiating DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired by crossovers or noncrossovers (gene conversions). While crossovers are easily detectable, the noncrossover identification is hampered by the small size of their converted tracts and the necessity of sequence polymorphism to detect them. We report identification and characterization of a mouse chromosome-wide set of noncrossovers by NGS sequencing of 10 mouse chromosome substitution strains. Based on 94 identified noncrossovers we determined the mean length of a conversion tract to be 32 basepairs. The spatial chromosome-wide distribution of noncrossovers and crossovers significantly differed, though both sets overlapped the known hotspots of PRDM9-directed histone methylation and DNA DSBs, thus proving their origin in the standard DSB repair pathway. A significant deficit of noncrossovers descending from asymmetric DSBs pointed to sister chromatids as an alternative template for their repair. The finding has implications for the molecular mechanism of hybrid sterility in mice.",

    "abstract": "All crops are the product of a domestication process that started less than 12,000 years ago from one or more wild populations [1, 2]. Farmers selected desirable phenotypic traits, such as improved energy accumulation, palatability of seeds or reduced natural shattering [3], while leading domesticated populations through several more or less gradual demographic contractions [2, 4]. As a consequence, erosion of wild genetic variation [5] is typical of modern cultivars making them highly susceptible to pathogens, pests and environmental change [6,7]. The loss of genetic diversity hampers further crop improvement programs to increase food production in a changing world, posing serious threats to food security [8,9]. Using both ancient and modern seeds, we analyzed the temporal dynamic of genetic variation and selection during the domestication process of the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) that occurred in the Southern Andes. Here we show that most domestic traits were selected for prior to 2,500 years ago, with no or only minor loss of whole-genome variation. In fact, i) all ancient domestic genomes dated between 600 and 2,500 years ago are highly variable - at least as variable as a modern genome from the wild; the genetic erosion that we observe in modern cultivars is therefore a recent process that occurred in the last centuries; ii) the majority of changes at coding genes that differentiate wild and domestic genomes are already present in the ancient genomes analyzed here. Considering that most desirable phenotypic traits are likely controlled by multiple polymorphic genes [10], a likely explanation of this decoupling of selection and genomic erosion is that early farmers applied a relatively weak selection pressure [2] by using many phenotypically similar but genomically diverse individuals as breeders. Selection strategies during the last few centuries were probably less sustainable and produced further improvements focusing on few plants carrying the traits of interest, at the cost of marked genetic erosion.",

Using single-cell RNA-sequencing coupled with RNAScope and fluorescence lifetime imaging, we identify three non-proliferative and one proliferative basal cell transcriptional states in homeostatic skin that differ in metabolic preference and become spatially partitioned during wound re-epithelialization. Pseudotemporal trajectory and RNA velocity analyses produce a quasi-linear differentiation hierarchy where basal cells progress from Col17a1high/Trp63high state to early response state, proliferate at the juncture of these two states, or become growth arrested before differentiating into spinous cells.

    "abstract": "Species of flies in the genus Drosophila differ dramatically in their preferences for mates, but little is known about the genetic or neurological underpinnings of this evolution. Recent advances have been made to our understanding of one case: pheromone preference evolution between the species D. melanogaster and D. simulans. Males of both species are very sensitive to the pheromone 7,11-HD that is present only on the cuticle of female D. melanogaster. In one species this cue activates courtship, and in the other it represses it. This change in valence was recently shown to result from the modification of central processing neurons, rather than changes in peripherally expressed receptors, but nothing is known about the genetic changes that are responsible. In the current study, we show that a 1.35 Mb locus on the X chromosome has a major effect on male 7,11-HD preference. Unfortunately, when this locus is divided, the effect is largely lost. We instead attempt to filter the 159 genes within this region using our newfound understanding of the neuronal underpinnings of this phenotype to identify and test candidate genes. We present the results of these tests, and discuss the difficulty of identifying the genetic architecture of behavioral traits and the potential of connecting these genetic changes to the neuronal modifications that elicit different behaviors.",

    "abstract": "The Val66Met single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has previously been reported to impact performance on recognition memory tasks. Whether the two subprocesses of recognition--familiarity and recollection--are differentially impacted by the Val66Met SNP remains unknown. Using event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded during a source memory task, we attempted to dissociate these two subprocesses. Behaviourally, we used participants scores on an item-recognition subtask as a measure of familiarity, and participants scores on a source-recognition subtask as a measure of recollection. Our findings reveal that Val/Val individuals outperform Met allele carriers on the item-but not the source-recognition task. Electrophysiologically, we were interested in the N400, an early frontal component previously linked to familiarity, and the late positive complex (LPC), a posterior component linked to recollection. We found evidence for Val/Val individuals having larger amplitudes of the LPC compared to Met allele carriers, and evidence for no difference in the N400 amplitudes of these groups. Based on the lack of dissociation between familiarity- and recollection-specific ERPs at the LPC time window, we argue that our behavioural and ERP results might reflect better item-recognition for Val/Val individuals compared to Met allele carriers. We further suggest that both these results reflect differences related to familiarity, rather than recollection.",

    "abstract": "The loss of crop yield due to weeds is an urgent agricultural problem. Although herbicides are an effective way to control weeds, more sustainable solutions for weed management are desirable. It has been proposed that crop plants can communally suppress weeds by shading them out. Shade avoidance responses, such as upward leaf movement (hyponasty) and stem or petiole elongation, enhance light capture of individual plants, increasing their individual fitness. The shading capacity of the entire crop community might, however, be more effective if aspects of shade avoidance are suppressed. Testing this hypothesis in crops is hampered by the lack of well-characterized mutants. We therefore investigated if Arabidopsis competitive performance at the community level against invading competitors is affected by the ability to display shade avoidance. We tested two mutants: pif4pif5 that has mildly reduced petiole elongation and hyponasty and pif7 with normal elongation but absent hyponasty in response to shade. Although pif4pif5 performed similar to wildtype, we found that pif7 showed significantly increased canopy biomass and suppression of invading competitors as compared to its wildtype. Our data thus show that modifying specific shade avoidance aspects has potential for plant community performance. This may help to suppress weeds in crop stands.\\n\\nHighlightHyponastic response in canopies facilitates light penetration and weed growth. Inhibition of this response to neighbors increased canopy biomass, canopy closure and suppression of competitors.",

However, the costs of egg laying not only relate to energetic requirements, but also depend on the availability of specific resources that are vital for egg production and embryonic development. One of these compounds are carotenoids, pigments with antioxidant properties and immuno-stimulatory functions, which are crucial during embryonic development. In this study, we explore how carotenoid availability alleviates this trade-off and facilitates egg laying in the blue tit. Blue tit females lay one egg per day and have the largest clutch size of all European passerines. We performed a lutein supplementation experiment, and measured potential consequences for egg laying capacity and egg quality. We found that lutein-supplemented females had less laying interruptions and thus completed their clutch faster than control females. No effects of treatment were found on the onset of egg laying or clutch size. Experimentally enhanced carotenoid availability did not elevate yolk carotenoid levels or egg mass, but negatively affected eggshell thickness. Our results provide hence evidence on the limiting role of carotenoids during egg laying, However, the benefits of laying faster following lutein supplementation were counterbalanced by a lower accumulation of calcium in the eggshell. Thus, even though single components may constrain egg laying, it is the combined availability of a range of different resources which ultimately determines egg quality and thus embryonic development.",

    "abstract": "Hepatic tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) is a cytoplasmic homotetrameric hemoprotein and the rate-limiting enzyme in the irreversible degradation of the essential amino acid L-tryptophan (L-Trp) to N-formylkynurenine, thus controlling the flux of L-Trp into its serotonergic and kynureninic/NAD pathways. TDO has long been recognized to be substrate-inducible via protein stabilization, but the molecular mechanism of this stabilization has remained elusive. Recent elucidation of human TDO (hTDO) crystal structure has identified a high-affinity (Kd {approx} 0.5 M) Trp-binding exosite in each of its 4 monomeric subunits. Mutation of the Glu105, Trp208 and Arg211 comprising this exosite not only abolished the high-affinity L-Trp binding, but also accelerated the ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of hTDO. We have further characterized this hTDO degradation by documenting that its ubiquitination by gp78/AMFR and CHIP E2/E3 ligase complexes occurs on external Lys-residues within or vicinal to acidic Asp/Glu and phosphorylated pSer/pThr (DEpSpT)-clusters. Furthermore, we have identified the unstructured hTDO N- and C-termini as imparting relatively high proteolytic instability, as their deletion ({Delta}NC) markedly prolonged hTDO t1/2. Additionally, although previous studies reported that upon hepatic heme-depletion, the heme-free apoTDO turns over with a t1/2 {approx} 2.2 h relative to the t1/2 of 7.7 h of holoTDO, mutating the axial heme-ligating His328 to Ala has the opposite effect of prolonging hTDO t1/2. Most importantly, introducing the exosite mutation into the {Delta}NC-deleted or H328A-mutant completely abolished their prolonged half-lives irrespective of L-Trp presence or absence, thereby revealing that the exosite is the molecular lynchpin that defines L-Trp-mediated TDO induction via protein stabilization.",

Two of the major challenges in scRNA-seq data analysis are dropout events and batch effects. The inflation of zero(dropout rate) varies substantially across single cells. Evidence has shown that technical noise, including batch effects, explains a notable proportion of this cell-to-cell variation. To capture biological variation, it is necessary to quantify and remove technical variation. Here, we introduce SCRIBE (Single-Cell Recovery Imputation with Batch Effects), a principled framework that imputes dropout events and corrects batch effects simultaneously. We demonstrate, through real examples, that SCRIBE outperforms existing scRNA-seq data analysis tools in recovering cell-specific gene expression patterns, removing batch effects and retaining biological variation across cells.

    "abstract": "Multiparent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) populations have recently been developed to allow the high-resolution mapping of complex quantitative traits. This article describes the development of one MAGIC population and verifies its potential application for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in B. juncea. The population was developed from eight founders with diverse traits and composed of 408 F6 recombinant inbred lines (RILs). To develop one rapid and simplified way for using the MAGIC population, a subset of 133 RILs as the primary mapping population were genotyped using 346 intron-length polymorphism (ILP) polymorphic markers. The population lacks significant signatures of population structure that are suitable for the analysis of complex traits. Genome-wide association mapping (GWAS) identified three major glucosinolate (GSL) QTLs of QGsl.ig01.1 on J01 for indole GSL (IG), QGsl.atg09.1 on J09 and QGsl.atg11.1 on J11 for aliphatic GSL (AG) and total GSL (TG). The candidate genes for QGsl.ig01.1, QGsl.atg09.1 and QGsl.atg11.1 are GSH1, GSL-ALK and MYB28, which are involved in converting glutamate and cysteine to{gamma} -EC, the accumulation of glucoraphanin, and the whole process of AG metabolism, respectively. One effective method for association mapping of quantitative traits in the B. juncea MAGIC population is also suggested by utilization of the remaining 275 RILs and incorporation of the novel kompetitive allele specific PCR (KASP) technique. In addition to its QTL mapping purpose, the MAGIC population could also be potentially utilized in variety development by breeders.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveDevelopment of obesity and type-2-diabetes (T2D) are associated with gut microbiota (GM) changes. The gut viral community is predominated by bacteriophages (phages), which are viruses that attack bacteria in a host-specific manner. As a proof-of-concept we demonstrate the efficacy of faecal virome transplantation (FVT) from lean donors for shifting the phenotype of obese mice into closer resemblance of lean mice.\\n\\nDesignThe FVT consisted of viromes extracted from the caecal content of mice fed a low-fat (LF) diet for fourteen weeks. Male C57BL/6NTac mice were divided into five groups: LF (as control), high-fat diet (HF), HF+Ampicillin (Amp), HF+Amp+FVT and HF+FVT. At week six and seven of the study the HF+FVT and HF+Amp+FVT mice were treated with FVT by oral gavage. The Amp groups were treated with ampicillin 24 h prior to first FVT treatment.\\n\\nResultsSix weeks after first FVT the HF+FVT mice showed a significant decrease in weight gain compared to the HF group. Further, glucose tolerance was comparable between the lean LF and HF+FVT mice, while the other HF groups all had impaired glucose tolerance. These observations were supported by significant shifts in GM composition, blood plasma metabolome, and expression levels of genes involved in obesity and T2D development.\\n\\nConclusionsTransfer of gut viral communities from mice with a lean phenotype into those with an obese phenotype reduce weight gain and normalise blood glucose parameters relative to lean mice.

    "abstract": "The human pregnane X receptor (PXR), a master regulator of drug metabolism, has important roles in intestinal homeostasis and abrogating inflammation. Existing PXR ligands have substantial off-target toxicity. Based on prior work that established microbial (indole) metabolites as PXR ligands, we proposed microbial metabolite mimicry as a novel strategy for drug discovery that allows to exploit previously unexplored parts of chemical space. Here we report functionalized indole-derivatives as first-in-class non-cytotoxic PXR agonists, as a proof-of-concept for microbial metabolite mimicry. The lead compound, FKK6, binds directly to PXR protein in solution, induces PXR specific target gene expression in, cells, human organoids, and mice. FKK6 significantly represses pro-inflammatory cytokine production cells and abrogates inflammation in mice expressing the human PXR gene. The development of FKK6 demonstrates for the first time that microbial metabolite mimicry is a viable strategy for drug discovery and opens the door to mine underexploited regions of chemical space.",

    "abstract": "Spectral information is commonly processed in the brain through generation of antagonistic responses to different wavelengths. In many species, these color opponent signals arise as early as photoreceptor terminals. Here, we measure the spectral tuning of photoreceptors in Drosophila. In addition to a previously described pathway comparing wavelengths at each point in space, we find a horizontal-cell-mediated pathway similar to that found in mammals. This pathway enables additional spectral comparisons through lateral inhibition, expanding the range of chromatic encoding in the fly. Together, these two pathways enable optimal decorrelation of photoreceptor signals. A biologically constrained model accounts for our findings and predicts a spatio-chromatic receptive field for fly photoreceptor outputs, with a color opponent center and broadband surround. This dual mechanism combines motifs of both an insect-specific visual circuit and an evolutionarily convergent circuit architecture, endowing flies with the unique ability to extract chromatic information at distinct spatial resolutions.",

We collected demographic data from 455 participants and asked them 26 questions/statements related to natural resources, climate change, economics, and health. We selected education as the focal demographic category and participants were categorized based on their level of educational attainment: 1) completion of high school or less (hereafter \\\"high school\\\"); 2) some trade school or university education beyond high school up to and including completion of a trade school, two-, or four-year degree (hereafter \\\"post-high school\\\"); and 3) completion of a Masters, professional, or doctoral degree (hereafter \\\"advanced education\\\"). Answers to 14 of the 26 survey questions were dissimilar across educational groups. People with advanced education reported the highest connection with the natural community and were more likely to report that their personal welfare depended on the natural community. Participants in the high school group were more likely to believe that humans do not have much influence on natural resources and placed more trust in technology and human achievements to control nature and ensure that earth will not become unlivable. Compared to those with education beyond high school, those with a high school education were more likely to express an interest in local environmental concerns over global, jobs over natural resources, and effects of degraded local natural resources on income, health, and the environment instead of on cultural/social practices, neighborhood aesthetics, and recreation. The results suggest ways in which educational information and engagement in environmental issues should be targeted for stakeholders of different educational background in order to increase knowledge and build effective partnerships that find solutions for environmental problems.",

    "abstract": "Observers reproducing elementary visual features from memory after a short delay produce errors consistent with the encoding-decoding properties of neural populations. While inspired by electrophysiological observations of sensory neurons in cortex, the population coding account of these errors is based on a mathematical idealization of neural response functions that abstracts away most of the heterogeneity and complexity of real neuronal populations. Here we examine a more physiologically grounded model based on the tuning of a large set of neurons recorded in macaque V1, and show that key predictions of the idealized model are preserved. Both models predict long-tailed distributions of error when memory resources are taxed, as observed empirically in behavioral experiments and commonly approximated with a mixture of normal and uniform error components. Specifically, for an idealized homogeneous neural population, the width of the fitted normal distribution cannot exceed the average tuning width of the component neurons, and this also holds to a good approximation for more biologically realistic populations. Examining eight published studies of orientation recall, we find a consistent pattern of results suggestive of a median tuning width of approximately 20 degrees, which compares well with neurophysiological observations. The finding that estimates of variability obtained by the normal-plus-uniform mixture method are bounded from above leads us to reevaluate previous studies that interpreted a saturation in width of the normal component as evidence for fundamental limits on the precision of perception, working memory and long-term memory.",

    "abstract": "The chromatin remodeling protein, dIno80 (Drosophila Ino80) regulates homeotic genes. We show that Ino80, along with Trx and ETP (Enhancer of Trithorax and Polycomb) proteins, interacts with two Polycomb/Trithorax Responsive Elements (PRE/TRE), iab-7 and bxd PRE in flies and the larval imaginal discs. In S2 cells, dIno80 localizes to the endogenous iab-7 and bxd-PREs. The localization of Ino80 and Pleiohomeotic (Pho) at the PRE is sensitive to the cellular abundance of each other; when levels of Ino80 are limiting, there is increased Pho enrichment, and Pho knock-down leads to increased enrichment of Ino80. We demonstrate that over-expression of dIno80 rescues the pupal lethality in pleiohomeotic (pho) deficient flies, which suggests that dIno80 has a role in cellular memory. The apparent competition between Pho and Ino80 for binding at the PRE indicates that Ino80 may act as a potential recruiter of the regulatory complex in addition to being a chromatin remodeler.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe null mutants of Pho and dIno80 show lethality at different stages of development in the fly, implying that they may function independent of each other. The observation that Pho-lethality can be rescued by overexpression of dIno80 with significant penetrance and that Ino80 has its own DNA binding domain, led us to predict that Ino80 may have Pho-independent functions, perhaps through non-canonical complexes. In the current study, we show that dIno80 interacts with bxd and iab-7 PRE in cooperation with Polycomb and Trithorax proteins and regulate the homeotic genes. The effect of knock-down or mutation of dIno80 results in altered phenotype in adult flies and rescue of Lac-Z expression in imaginal discs, in parallel with similar effect of Pho mutation or knock-down. We provide evidence of direct interaction of dIno80 with iab7- and bxd-PRE using chromatin immunoprecipitation. The dIno80 localization in and around the PRE sequence was enhanced in the absence of Pho, indicating competition between Pho and dIno80 for binding at the PRE.",

    "abstract": "The collar rot causing oomycete, Phytophthora agathidicida, threatens the long-term survival of the iconic New Zealand kauri. Currently, testing for this pathogen involves an extended soil bioassay that takes 14-20 days and requires specialised staff, consumables, and infrastructure. Here we describe a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for the detection of P. agathidicida that targets a portion of the mitochondrial apocytochrome b coding sequence. This assay has high specificity and sensitivity; it did not cross react with a range of other Phytophthora isolates and detected as little as 1 fg of total P. agathidicida DNA or 116 copies of the target locus. Assay performance was further investigated by testing plant tissue baits from flooded soil samples using both the extended bioassay and LAMP testing of DNA extracted from baits. In these comparisons, P. agathidicida was detected more frequently using the LAMP assay. In addition to greater sensitivity, by removing the need for culturing, the hybrid baiting plus LAMP approach is more cost effective than the bioassay and, importantly, does not require a centralised laboratory facility with specialised staff, consumables, and equipment. Such testing will allow us to address outstanding questions about P. agathidicida. For example, the hybrid approach could enable monitoring of the pathogen beyond areas with visible disease symptoms, allow direct evaluation of rates and patterns of spread, and allow the effectiveness of disease control to be evaluated. The hybrid assay also has the potential to empower local communities. These communities could use this diagnostic tool to evaluate the pathogen status of local kauri stands, providing information around which to base their management and allowing informed engagement with wider initiatives.",

    "abstract": "Real-time reverse transcription PCR (qPCR) normalized to an internal reference gene (RG), is a frequently used method for quantifying gene expression changes in neuroscience. Although RG expression is assumed to be constantly independent of physiological or experimental conditions, several studies have shown that commonly used RGs are not expressed stably. The use of unstable RGs has a profound effect on the conclusions drawn from studies on gene expression, and almost universally results in spurious estimation of target gene expression. Approaches aimed at selecting and validating RGs often make use of different statistical methods, which may lead to conflicting results. The present study evaluates the expression of 5 candidate RGs (Actb, Pgk1, Sdha, Gapdh, Rnu6b) as a function of hypoxia exposure and hypothermic treatment in the neonatal rat cerebral cortex -in order to identify RGs that are stably expressed under these experimental conditions- and compares several statistical approaches that have been proposed to validate RGs. In doing so, we first analyzed the RG ranking stability proposed by several widely used statistical methods and related tools, i.e. the Coefficient of Variation (CV) analysis, GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and the {Delta}Ct method. Subsequently, we compared RG expression patterns between the various experimental groups. We found that these statistical methods, next to producing different rankings per se, all ranked RGs displaying significant differences in expression levels between groups as the most stable RG. As a consequence, when assessing the impact of RG selection on target gene expression quantification, substantial differences in target gene expression profiles were observed. As such, by assessing mRNA expression profiles within the neonatal rat brain cortex in hypoxia and hypothermia as a showcase, this study underlines the importance of further validating RGs for each new experimental paradigm considering the limitations of each selection method.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionThe main strategy for decreasing maternal morbidity and mortality with antenatal care (ANC). ANC aims to monitor and maintain the health and safety of the mother and fetus, detect all complications of pregnancy and take the necessary actions, respond to complaints, prepare for birth, and promote healthy living behavior. The study aims to analyze inter-regional disparities in [&ge;]4 ANC visits during pregnancy in Indonesia.\\n\\nMethodsData sources from 2017 Indonesian Demographic and Health Survey (IDHS). With an analysis unit of women aged 15-49 years old, a sample of 15,351 women was obtained. Besides ANC as the dependent variable, other variables analyzed were place of residence, age, husband/partner, education, parity, wealth status, and health insurance. Analysis using Binary Logistic Regression for the final test to determine disparity.\\n\\nResultsAll regions show a gap with the Papua region as a reference, except the Maluku region which was not significant shows differences in the use of ANC compared to the Papua. Women in the Nusa Tenggara have 4,365 chances of making [&ge;]4 ANC visits compared to the Papua region. Women in Java-Bali have 3,607 times more chances to make [&ge;]4 ANC visits than women in the Papua region. Women in Sumatra have 1,370 chances of making [&ge;]4 ANC visits compared to women in the Papua region. Women in Kalimantan have 2.232 times made [&ge;]4 ANC visits compared to women in the Papua region. Women in Sulawesi have 1,980 times more than AN4 ANC visits compared to women in the Papua region. In addition to the region category, other variables found to contribute to the predictor were age, husband/partner, education, parity, wealth and insurance.\\n\\nConclusionThere were disparities between regions in the ANC utilization in Indonesia.",

    "abstract": "In this study we report about the reproducibility of three-dimensional cell culture of floating cell spheroids on PEG6000 treated cell culture dishes. Three-dimensional tumour spheroids or organoids present an interesting test platform for nanoparticulated drug delivery or nanoparticle toxicity. We tested the reproducibility of spheroid formation induced by the PEG coated surface. Interestingly we found that the results were different in a reproducible manner depending on the distributors of PEG6000.\\n\\nDespite the nearly identical physicochemical properties of PEG6000 (MALDI-MS, NMR, FTIR, Triple SEC) with only minor differences, we observed only for one PEG6000 a highly reproducible formation of spheroids with different cell lines such as HT-29, HeLa, Caco2, and PANC-1. The surface coating with the different PEG6000 was studied by AFM. The surface coating as well as the physicochemical characterization showed only small differences in mass and hydrodynamic radius between the different PEGs. A direct coating of the cells with PEG from two distributors indicate that the spheroid formation in due to direct interaction of the polymer with the cell rather than by interaction of cells with the coated surface.\\n\\nThe experiments point out that for biological entities, such as cells or tissues, even very small differences such as impurities or batch-to-batch variations in the purchased product can have a very strong impact.",

    "abstract": "The applications of liquid biopsy have attracted much attention in biomedical research in recent years. Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in the serum may serve as a unique tumor marker in various types of cancer. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a type of serum cfDNA found in patients with cancer and contains abundant information regarding tumor characteristics, highlighting its potential diagnostic value in the clinical setting. However, the diagnostic value of cfDNA as a biomarker in cervical cancer remains unclear. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the applications of ctDNA as a biomarker in cervical cancer. A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, Embase, and WANFANG MED ONLINE databases up to March 18, 2019. All literature was analyzed using Meta Disc 1.4 and STATA 14.0 software. Diagnostic measures of accuracy of ctDNA in cervical cancer were pooled and investigated. Fifteen studies comprising 1109 patients with cervical cancer met our inclusion criteria and were subjected to analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.52 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.33-0.71) and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.91-0.99), respectively. The pooled positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio were 16.0 (95% CI, 5.5-46.4) and 0.50 (95% CI, 0.33-0.75), respectively. The diagnostic odds ratio was 32 (95% CI, 10-108), and the area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.90- 0.94). There was no significant publication bias observed. In the included studies, ctDNA showed clear diagnostic value for diagnosing and monitoring cervical cancer. Our meta-analysis suggested that detection of human papilloma virus ctDNA in patients with cervical cancer could be used as a noninvasive early dynamic biomarker of tumors, with high specificity and moderate sensitivity. Further large-scale prospective studies are required to validate the factors that may influence the accuracy of cervical cancer diagnosis and monitoring.",
