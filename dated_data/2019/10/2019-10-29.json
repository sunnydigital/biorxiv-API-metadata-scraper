    "abstract": "The long-ranged coupling between residues that gives rise to allostery in a protein is built up from short-ranged physical interactions. Computational tools used to predict this coupling and its functional relevance have relied on the application of graph theoretical metrics to residue-level correlations measured from all-atom molecular dynamics (aaMD) simulations. The short-ranged interactions that yield these long-ranged residue-level correlations are quantified by the effective coarse-grained Hessian. Here we compute an effective harmonic coarse-grained Hessian from aaMD simulations of a benchmark allosteric protein, IGPS, and demonstrate the improved locality of this graph Laplacian over two other connectivity matrices. Additionally, two centrality metrics are developed that indicate the direct and indirect importance of each residue at producing the covariance between the effector binding pocket and the active site. The residue importance indicated by these two metrics is corroborated by previous mutagenesis experiments and leads to unique functional insights; in contrast to previous computational analyses, our results suggest that fP76-hK181 is the most important contact for conveying direct allosteric paths across the HisF-HisH interface. The connectivity around fD98 is found to be important at affecting allostery through indirect means.",

    "abstract": "Many drugs investigated for the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) have had poor clinical outcomes, as their efficacy is dependent on adequate delivery to sensitive tumor cell populations, which is limited by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Further complicating evaluation of therapeutic efficacy, tumors can become resistant to anti-cancer drugs, and it can be difficult to gauge the extent to which BBB limitations and resistance each contribute to a drugs failure. To address this question, we developed a minimal mathematical model to characterize these elements of overall drug response, informed by time-series bioluminescence imaging data from a treated patient-derived xenograft (PDX) experimental model. By fitting this mathematical model to a preliminary dataset in a series of nonlinear regression steps, we estimated parameter values for individual PDX subjects that correspond to the dynamics seen in experimental data. Using these estimates, we performed a parameter sensitivity analysis using Latin hypercube sampling and partial rank correlation coefficients. Results from this analysis combined with simulation results suggest that BBB permeability may play a slightly larger role in therapeutic efficacy than drug resistance. Our model and fitting technique to estimate parameters from data may be a useful tool in aiding further exploration of these challenges in future studies of drug efficacy with larger datasets.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic modifications can contribute to adaptation, but the relative contributions of genetic and epigenetic variation are unknown. Previous studies on the role of epigenetic changes in adaptation in eukaryotes have nearly exclusively focused on cytosine methylation (m5C), while prokaryotes exhibit a richer system of methyltransferases targetting adenines (m6A) or cytosines (m4C, m5C). DNA methylation in prokaryotes has many roles, but its potential role in adaptation still needs further investigation. We collected phenotypic, genetic, and epigenetic data using single molecule real-time sequencing of clones of the bacterium Serratia marcescens that had undergone experimental evolution in contrasting temperatures to investigate the relationship between environment and genetic, epigenetic, and phenotypic changes. This data provided a detailed description of the methylation landscape of S. marcescens and allowed us to examine the potential contributions of genetic and epigenetic changes to phenotypic adaptation. The genomic distribution of GATC motifs, which are the main target for m6A methylation, and of partially methylated epiloci pointed to a link between m6A methylation and regulation of gene expression in S. marcescens. Evolved strains, while genetically homogeneous, exhibited many polymorphic m6A epiloci. There was no strong support for a genetic control of methylation changes in our experiment, and no clear evidence of parallel environmentally-induced or environmentally-selected methylation changes at specific epiloci was found. Both some genetic and epigenetic variants were associated with some phenotypic traits. Overall, our results suggest that both genetic and adenine methylation changes have potential to contribute to phenotypic adaptation in S. marcescens, but that any environmentally-induced epigenetic change occurring in our experiment would probably have been quite labile.",

    "abstract": "Orthologs of human glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and human mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) first appear in cartilaginous fishes. Subsequently, the MR and GR diverged to respond to different steroids: the MR to aldosterone and the GR to cortisol and corticosterone. We report that cortisol, corticosterone and aldosterone activate full-length elephant shark GR, and progesterone, which activates elephant shark MR, does not activate elephant shark GR. However, progesterone inhibits steroid binding to elephant shark GR, but not to human GR. Together, this indicates partial functional divergence of elephant shark GR from the MR. Deletion of the N-terminal domain (NTD) from elephant shark GR (truncated GR) reduced the response to corticosteroids, while truncated and full-length elephant shark MR had similar responses to corticosteroids. Swapping of NTDs of elephant shark GR and MR yielded an elephant shark MR chimera with full-length GR-like increased activation by corticosteroids and progesterone compared to full-length elephant shark MR. Elephant shark MR NTD fused to GR DBD+LBD had similar activation as full-length MR, indicating that the MR NTD lacked GR-like NTD activity. We propose that NTD activation of human GR evolved early in GR divergence from the MR.",

    "abstract": "We are constantly faced with the trade-off between exploiting actions with known outcomes and exploring alternative actions whose outcomes may be better. This balance has been hypothesized to rely on dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc)1 and noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus (LC)2-3. We developed a behavioral paradigm to capture exploitative and exploratory states, and imaged calcium dynamics in genetically-identified dopaminergic SNc neurons and noradrenergic LC neurons during state transitions. During exploitative states, characterized by motivated repetition of the same action choice, we found dichotomous changes in baseline activity in SNc and LC, with SNc showing higher and LC showing lower sustained activity. These sustained neural states emerged from the accumulation of lengthened positive responses and hysteretic dynamics in SNc networks, and lengthened negative responses in LC. Sustained activity could not be explained by classical reinforcement learning parameters, and in SNc but not LC, emerged in subpopulations coding for response vigor. Manipulating the sustained activity of SNc and LC revealed that dopaminergic activity primarily mediates engagement and motivation, whereas noradrenergic activity modulates action selection. These data uncover the emergence of sustained neural states in dopaminergic and noradrenergic networks that mediate dissociable aspects of exploitative bouts.",

    "abstract": "Visual processing in parietal areas of the dorsal stream facilitates sensorimotor transformations for rapid movement. This action-related visual processing is hypothesized to play a distinct functional role from the perception-related processing in the ventral stream. However, it is unclear how the two streams interact when perceptual identification is a prerequisite to executing an accurate movement. In the current study, we investigated how perceptual decision-making involving the ventral stream influences arm and eye movement strategies. Participants (N = 26) moved a robotic manipulandum using right whole-arm movements to rapidly reach a stationary object or intercept a moving object on an augmented-reality display. On some blocks of trials, participants needed to identify the shape of the object (circle or ellipse) as a cue to either hit the object (circle) or move to a pre-defined location away from the object (ellipse). We found that during perceptual decision-making, there was an increased urgency to act during interception movements relative to reaching, which was associated with more decision errors. Faster hand reaction times were correlated with a strategy to adjust the movement post-initiation, and this strategy was more prominent during interception. Saccadic reaction times were faster and initial gaze lags and gains greater during decisions, suggesting that eye movements adapt to perceptual demands for guiding limb movements. Together, our findings suggest that the integration of ventral stream information with visuomotor planning depends on imposed (or perceived) task demands.\n\nNew and NoteworthyVisual processing for perception and for action are thought to be mediated by two specialized neural pathways. Using a visuomotor decision-making task, we show that participants differentially utilized online perceptual decision-making in reaching and interception, and that eye movements necessary for perception influenced motor decision strategies. These results provide evidence that task complexity modulates how pathways processing perception versus action information interact during the visual control of movement.",

    "abstract": "NAD+ is an essential metabolite participating in cellular biochemical processes and signaling. The regulation and interconnection among multiple NAD+ biosynthesis pathways are not completely understood. We previously identified the N-terminal (Nt) protein acetyltransferase complex NatB as a NAD+ homeostasis factor. Cells lacking NatB show an approximate 50% reduction in the NAD+ level and aberrant metabolism of NAD+ precursors, which are associated with a decrease of nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferases (Nmnat) protein levels. Here we show this decrease in NAD+ and Nmnat protein levels is specifically due to the absence of Nt-acetylation of Nmnat (Nma1 and Nma2) proteins, and not other NatB substrates. Nt-acetylation is a critical regulator of protein degradation by the N-end rule pathways, indicating absence of Nt-acetylation may alter Nmnat protein stability. Interestingly, the rate of protein turnover (t1/2) of non-Nt-acetylated Nmnats does not significantly differ from Nt-acetylated Nmnats, suggesting reduced Nmnat levels in NmatB mutants are not due to increased post-translational degradation of non-Nt-acetylated Nmnats. In line with these observations, deletion or depletion of N-rule pathway ubiquitin E3 ligases in NatB mutants is not sufficient to restore NAD+ levels. Moreover, the status of Nt-acetylation does not alter the rate of translation initiation of Nmnats. Collectively our studies suggest absence of Nt-acetylation may increase co-translational degradation of nascent Nmnat polypeptides, which results in reduced Nmnat levels in NatB mutants. Nmnat activities are essential for all routes of NAD+ biosynthesis. Understanding the regulation of Nmnat protein homeostasis will facilitate our understanding of the molecular basis and regulation of NAD+ metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), the largest class of transmembrane cell surface receptors, initiate signalling pathways which regulate diverse cellular processes. On activation these receptors rapidly recruit multiple downstream effector proteins to moderate affinity tyrosyl phosphate (pY) binding sites. However, the mechanism for expedient downstream effector protein recruitment via random molecular diffusion through the cytoplasm is not fully understood. One way in which the probabilistic outcome associated with random diffusion could be alleviated is through localized accumulation of high effective concentrations of signalling proteins in discrete pools in the cell (1). The inclusion of interacting proteins into liquid-liquid phase-separated (LLPS), membraneless protein droplets maintains functionally relevant proteins at high concentrations in a liquid phase at the required point of action, enhancing equilibrium binding and enzyme activity (2-6). These LLPS states have been associated with a wide range of cellular functions including regulation of signalling through, for example, nephrin (7, 8), the T-cell receptor (9), mTOR (10), and Sos-Ras (11), however, whether LLPS extends to RTK-mediated signal transduction has not been investigated. Here, we show that an RTK, fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2), forms a signalling competent LLPS state with two downstream effectors, a tandem Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (Shp2), and 1-phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate phosphodiesterase gamma 1 (Plc{gamma}1). We show that these proteins assemble into a ternary complex which exploits LLPS condensation to simultaneously modulate kinase, phosphatase and phospholipase activities. Therefore, LLPS formation ensures that the requirement for prolonged, high-fidelity signalling is achieved. Additional RTKs also form LLPS with their downstream effectors, suggesting that formation of biological condensates is a key organising principle of RTK-mediated signalling, with broad implications for further mechanistic studies as well as therapeutic intervention.",

Transcriptomic data generated from one Barthelona strain (PAP020) was used for large-scale, multi-gene phylogenetic (phylogenomic) analyses. Our analyses robustly placed strain PAP020 at the base of the Fornicata clade, indicating that barthelonids represent a deep-branching Metamonad clade. Considering the anaerobic/microaerophilic nature of barthelonids and preliminary electron microscopy observations on strain PAP020, we suspected that barthelonids possess functionally and structurally reduced mitochondria (i.e. mitochondrion-related organelles or MROs). The metabolic pathways localized in the MRO of strain PAP020 were predicted based on its transcriptomic data and compared with those in the MROs of fornicates. Strain PAP020 is most likely incapable of generating ATP in the MRO, as no mitochondrial/MRO enzymes involved in substrate-level phosphorylation were detected. Instead, we detected the putative cytosolic ATP-generating enzyme (acetyl-CoA synthetase), suggesting that strain PAP020 depends on ATP generated in the cytosol. We propose two separate losses of substrate-level phosphorylation from the MRO in the clade containing barthelonids and (other) fornicates.",

We show that species trees are identifiable under a standard stochastic model for GDL, and that the polynomial-time algorithm ASTRAL-multi, a recent development in the ASTRAL suite of methods, is statistically consistent under this GDL model.

The results showed support for genetically distinct and diverse phylogeographic groups consistent with southern and northern glacial refugia, as expected from previous studies, but also identified geographical barriers concordant with glaciated mountain ranges during the LGM, early diversification events dated between the Upper Pleistocene and Lower Holocene for the main phylogeographic groups, and recent (post-LGM) patterns of demographic expansions. The results have implications for the conservation of intraspecific diversity and the preservation of the evolutionary potential of S. minutus.",

    "abstract": "RationaleThe recently discovered meningeal lymphatic vessels (mLVs) have been proposed to be the missing link between the immune and the central nervous systems. The role of mLVs in modulating the neuro-immune response following a brain injury, however, has not been analyzed. Parenchymal T lymphocyte infiltration has been previously reported as part of secondary events after traumatic brain injury (TBI), suggestive of an adaptive neuro-immune response. The phenotype of these cells has remained mostly uncharacterized. In this study, we identified the subpopulations of T cells infiltrating the perilesional areas 30 days post-injury (an early-chronic time point). Furthermore, we analyzed how the lack of mLVs affects the magnitude and the type of immune response in the brain after TBI.\n\nMethodsTBI was induced in K14-VEGFR3-Ig transgenic (TG) mice or in their littermate controls (WT; wild type), applying a controlled cortical impact (CCI). One month after TBI, T cells were isolated from cortical areas ipsilateral or contralateral to the trauma and from the spleen, then characterized by flow cytometry. Lesion size in each animal was evaluated by MRI.\n\nResultsIn both WT and TG-CCI mice, we found a prominent T cell infiltration in the brain confined to the perilesional cortex and hippocampus. The majority of infiltrating T cells were cytotoxic CD8+ expressing a CD44hiCD69+ phenotype, suggesting that these are effector resident memory T cells. K14-VEGFR3-Ig mice showed a significant reduction of infiltrating CD4+ T lymphocytes, implying that mLVs are important in establishing a proper neuro-immune response. Extension of the lesion (measured as lesion volume from MRI) did not differ between the genotypes. Finally, TBI did not relate with alterations in peripheral circulating T cells, as assessed one month after injury induction.\n\nConclusionsOur data support the hypothesis that mLVs are pivotal for a proper and specific neuro-immune response after TBI, which is principally mediated by the resident memory CD8+ T cells.",

    "abstract": "The process by which visual information is incorporated into the brains spatial framework to represent landmarks is poorly understood. Studies in humans and rodents suggest that retrosplenial cortex (RSC) plays a key role in these computations. We developed an RSC-dependent behavioral task in which head-fixed mice learned the spatial relationship between visual landmark cues and hidden reward locations. Two-photon imaging revealed that these cues served as dominant reference points for most task-active neurons and anchored the spatial code in RSC. Presenting the same environment but decoupled from mouse behavior degraded encoding fidelity. Analyzing visual and motor responses showed that landmark codes were the result of supralinear integration. Surprisingly, V1 axons recorded in RSC showed similar receptive fields. However, they were less modulated by task engagement, indicating that landmark representations in RSC are the result of local computations. Our data provide cellular- and network-level insight into how RSC represents landmarks.",

In the SLIMM-T2D trial, participants with T2D were randomized to RYGB or nonsurgical management and their fasting plasma proteome and metabolome were analyzed for up to 3 years. To identify analytes that mediate improvement in outcomes, we developed a high-throughput mediation analysis method (Hitman), which is significantly more powerful than existing methods. Top-ranking analyte mediators of glycemia improvement were growth hormone receptor and prolylhydroxyproline, which were more significant than any clinical mediator, including BMI. Beta-alanine and Histidine Metabolism (both including CNDP1) were top differentially regulated pathways, and Valine, Leucine and Isoleucine Degradation was also a top differentially-regulated pathway and a top mediator of improvement in insulin resistance. The identified analytes may serve as novel targets for T2D therapy. More broadly, Hitman can identify analyte mediators of outcomes in randomized trials for which high-throughput data are available.",

    "abstract": "The occurrence of foams at oceans surfaces is patchy and generally short-lived but a detailed understanding of bacterial communities inhabiting sea foams is lacking. Here we investigated how marine foams differ from the sea-surface microlayer (SML), a <1 mm thick layer at the air-sea interface and underlying water from 1 m depth. Samples of sea foams, SML and underlying water collected from the North Sea and Timor Sea indicated that foams were often characterized by a high abundance of small eukaryotic phototrophic and prokaryotic cells as well as a high concentration of surface-active substances (SAS). Amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA (gene) revealed a distinctive foam bacterial community compared to SML and underlying water, with high abundance of Gammaproteobacteria. Especially Pseudoalteromonas and Vibrio, typical SML dwellers, were highly abundant, active foam inhabitants and thus might enhance foam formation and stability by producing SAS. Despite a clear difference in the overall bacterial community composition between foam and SML, the presence of SML bacteria in foams supports previous assumptions that foam is strongly influenced by the SML. We conclude that active and abundant bacteria from interfacial habitats potentially contribute to foam formation and stability, carbon cycling and air-sea exchange processes in the ocean.\n\nOne-sentence summaryFloating foams at the oceans surface have a unique bacterial community signature in contrast to sea-surface microlayer and underlying water but receive and select for bacterial inhabitants from surface habitats.",

    "abstract": "A major frontier in neuroscience is to find neural correlates of perception, learning, decision making, and a variety of other types of behavior. In the last decades, modern devices allow simultaneous recordings of different operant responses and the electrical activity of large neuronal populations. However, the commercially available instruments for studying operant conditioning are expensive, and the design of low-cost chambers has emerged as an appealing alternative to resource-limited laboratories engaged in animal behavior. In this article, we provide a full description of a platform that records the operant behavior and synchronizes it with the electrophysiological activity. The programming of this platform is open source, flexible and adaptable to a wide range of operant conditioning tasks. We also show results of operant conditioning experiments with freely moving rats with simultaneous electrophysiological recordings.\n\nSpecifications table\n\nO_TBL View this table:\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@114843corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f59122org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10b5b77org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a220bdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@136c1b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_TBL C_TBL",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous, voluntary actions are often accompanied by motor intentions, that is the experience of \\\"being about to move\\\". The emergence of this experience is contentiously discussed, culminating in two opposing views of motor intention. While prospective theorists hold that an intention to move genuinely precedes the action, retrospective theorists suggest that an intention is reconstructed only after action execution. As such, both theories offer radically different predictions about the possibility of voluntary control over action intention. We assess here the respective contributions of prospective and retrospective factors in motor intention awareness in a real-time EEG setup. Participants performed self-paced movements with intermittent interruption by cues, signalling to either move or not to move. Cues were triggered by a brain-computer interface upon detection of either the presence or absence of a readiness potential (RP), a signal known to precede self-paced voluntary actions. Subsequently, participants reported their intention to move at the time of the cue. We found that participants were more likely to report an intention to move when the cue was followed by a movement than no movement, highlighting the effect of retrospection on awareness of intention. Interestingly, however, an intention to move was also more frequently reported when the cue was elicited by an RP, compared to when no RP was present, suggesting that awareness of intention is also informed by motor preparation processes, congruent with prospective theories. Overall, our findings show that intention awareness in voluntary action relies on both prospective and retrospective components, and we describe here how these two factors are dynamically integrated over time.",

    "abstract": "Several sensorimotor modifications are known to occur with aging, possibly leading to adverse outcomes such as falls. Recently, some of those modifications have been proposed to emerge from motor planning deteriorations. Motor planning of vertical movements is thought to engage an internal model of gravity to anticipate its mechanical effects on the body-limbs and thus to genuinely produce movements that minimize muscle effort. This is supported, amongst other results, by direction-dependent kinematics where relative durations to peak accelerations and peak velocity are shorter for upward than for downward movements. The present study compares motor planning of fast and slow vertical arm reaching movements between eighteen young (24 {+/-} 3 years old) and seventeen older adults (70 {+/-} 5 years old). We found that older participants still exhibit directional asymmetries (i.e., differences between upward and downward movements), indicating that optimization processes during motor planning persist with healthy aging. However, the size of these differences was increased in older participants, indicating that gravity-related motor planning changes with age. We discuss this increase as the possible result of an overestimation of gravity torque or increased weight of the effort cost in the optimization process. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that feedforward processes and, more precisely, optimal motor planning, remain active with healthy aging.",

    "abstract": "Conservation science is a crisis-oriented discipline focused on delivering robust answers to reducing human impacts on nature. To explore how the field might have changed during the past two decades, we analyzed 3,245 applications for oral presentations submitted to the Student Conference on Conservation Science (SCCS) in Cambridge, UK. SCCS has been running every year since 2000, aims for global representation by providing bursaries to early-career conservationists from lower-income countries, and has never had a thematic focus, beyond conservation in the broadest sense. We found that the majority of submissions to SCCS were based on primary biological data collection from local scale field studies in the tropics, contrary to established literature which highlights gaps in tropical research. Our results showed a small increase over time in submissions framed around how nature benefits people as well as a small increase in submissions integrating social science. Our findings also suggest that students and early-career conservationists could provide pathways to increased availability of data from the tropics and for addressing well-known biases in the published literature towards wealthier countries. We hope this research will motivate efforts to support student projects, ensuring data and results are published and made publicly available.",

    "abstract": "The concept of treating women as equal to their male counterpart became a topic of political debate in Europe during the  age of enlightenment (18th Century). The battle towards equal voting rights took approximately 100 years to win, and went until the 19th Century. It was only around 1902-1920 that women got equal voting rights in prominent Western countries followed by others. Amidst the celebration of  womens vote centenary throughout the world, the issue of equal rights to education and work is still waiting for the proper attention. Historically the presence of women in educational, technological and scientific fields remains mostly marginal. In this article, the current state of under-representation of women in the science and technology community is depicted, primarily highlighting the Indian scenario. It is observed that throughout India, and amongst the relatively developed countries of the world, the presence of women in highly prestigious Institutes and Universities remains negligible even in this day and age. The probable causes behind such inequality need to be analyzed, addressed and looked upon for remedial purposes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFunctional Mitral Regurgitation (FMR) affects nearly 3 million patients in the United States. Conventional indices are limited for predicting FMR response to coronary revascularization (REVASC). Uncertainty as to which patients will respond to REVASC alone impedes rational decision-making regarding FMR management. Determination of myocardial material parameters associated with ischemic myocardium will address knowledge gaps regarding the impact of ischemia on regional cardiac muscle.\\n\\nMethodWe proposed a novel MRI-based finite element (FE) modeling method to determine the effect of ischemia on myocardial contractility. The method was applied to two patients with multi-vessel coronary disease and FMR and one healthy volunteer. Cardiac MRI (CMR) included cine-MRI, gadolinium-enhanced stress perfusion, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), and non-invasive tagged MRI (CSPAMM). The left ventricular (LV) FE model was divided into 17 sectors. Sector-specific circumferential and longitudinal end-systolic strain and LV volume from CSPAMM were used in a formal optimization to determine the sector based myocardial contractility, Tmax.\\n\\nResultsThe FE optimization successfully converged with good agreement between calculated and experimental end-systolic strain and LV volumes. Specifically, the optimized TmaxH for Patient 1, Patient 2, and the volunteer was 336.8 kPa, 401.4 kPa, and 259.4 kPa and  for Patient 1 and Patient 2 was 0.44 and 0.\\n\\nConclusionWe developed a novel computational method able to predict the effect of myocardial ischemia in patients with FMR. This method can be used to predict the effect of ischemia on the regional myocardium and promises to facilitate better understanding of FMR response to REVASC.",

Recent advances in sequencing provide unprecedented amounts of sequence data that can be statistically analysed by methods such as Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) to determine spatial proximity or contacts of specific nucleic acid pairs, which improve the quality of structure prediction. To quantify this structure prediction improvement, we here present a well curated dataset of about seventy RNA structures with high resolution and compare different nucleotide-nucleotide contact prediction methods available in the literature. We observe only minor difference between the performances of the different methods. Moreover, we discuss how these predictions are robust for different contact definitions and how strongly depend on procedures used to curate and align the families of homologous RNA sequences.",

Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs) with high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity (ALDH+ cells) are reported to be enriched following AE treatment. Here we perform in vitro and in vivo functional CSC assays and gene expression analysis to characterise the ALDH+ population in AE resistant metastatic patient samples and an ER+ cell line. We show that the IL1{beta} signalling pathway is activated in ALDH+ cells and data from single cells reveals that AE treatment selects for IL1R1-expressing ALDH+ cells. Importantly, we demonstrate that increased expression of IL1R1 is observed in the tumours of patients treated with AE therapy and predicts for treatment failure. Single-cell gene expression analysis revealed that at least 2 sub-populations exist within the ALDH+ population, one proliferative and one quiescent. Following AE therapy, the quiescent ALDH+IL1R1+ population is expanded, which suggests CSC dormancy as an adaptive strategy that facilitates treatment resistance. Supporting this, analysis of AE resistant dormant tumours reveals significantly increased expression of ALDH1A1, ALDH1A3 and IL1R1 genes. Thus, we propose that targeting of ALDH+IL1R1+ cells will reverse AE resistance, including in patients with minimal residual disease.",

To test this, we collected data from four salt stressed sage plots and four unstressed plots at Columbia National Wildlife Refuge in Othello, Washington during 2010. We report significantly greater average gall density on plants in salt stressed plots. We collected four types of galls (artichoke, white fuzzy, black fuzzy, smooth, and other) and observed no significant difference in the diversity of galls on sage in salt stressed plots compared to the control. Further studies are needed to understand why salt stressed sage show greater density of galls, why insect galls seem to thrive on salt stressed sage.",

We established high-precision maps of DNase I hypersensitive sites from 733 human biosamples encompassing 439 cell and tissue types and states, and integrated these to precisely delineate and numerically index ~3.6 million DHSs encoded within the human genome, providing a common coordinate system for regulatory DNA. Here we show that the expansive scale of cell and tissue states sampled exposes an unprecedented degree of stereotyped actuation of large sets of elements, signaling the operation of distinct genome-scale regulatory programs. We show further that the complex actuation patterns of individual elements can be captured comprehensively by a simple regulatory vocabulary reflecting their dominant cellular manifestation. This vocabulary, in turn, enables comprehensive and quantitative regulatory annotation of both protein-coding genes and the vast array of well-defined but poorly-characterized non-coding RNA genes. Finally, we show that the combination of high-precision DHSs and regulatory vocabularies markedly concentrate disease- and trait-associated non-coding genetic signals both along the genome and across cellular compartments. Taken together, our results provide a common and extensible coordinate system and vocabulary for human regulatory DNA, and a new global perspective on the architecture of human gene regulation.",

As such the fully haploid human cell line, eHAP1, has been used in a wide array of studies. However, the absence of a corresponding reference genome sequence for this cell line has limited the potential for more widespread applications to experiments dependent on available sequence, like capture-clone methodologies.\\n\\nResultsWe generated ~15x coverage Nanopore long reads from ten GridION flowcells. We utilized this data to assemble a de novo draft genome using minimap and miniasm and subsequently polished using Racon. This assembly was further polished using previously generated, low-coverage, Illumina short reads with Pilon and ntEdit. This resulted in a hybrid eHAP1 assembly with >90% complete BUSCO scores. We further assessed the eHAP1 long read data for structural variants using Sniffles and identify a variety of rearrangements, including a previously established Philadelphia translocation. Finally, we demonstrate how some of these variants overlap open chromatin regions, potentially impacting regulatory regions.\\n\\nConclusionsBy integrating both long and short reads, we generated a high-quality reference assembly for eHAP1 cells. We identify structural variants using long reads, including some that may impact putative regulatory elements. The union of long and short reads demonstrates the utility in combining sequencing platforms to generate a high-quality reference genome de novo solely from low coverage data. We expect the resulting eHAP1 genome assembly to provide a useful resource to enable novel experimental applications in this important model cell line.",

    "abstract": "Many ecological and evolutionary processes in animals depend upon microbial symbioses. In spiders, the role of the microbiome in these processes remains mostly unknown. We compared the microbiome between populations, individuals, and tissue types of a range-expanding spider, using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Our study is one of the first to go beyond targeting known endosymbionts in spiders, and characterizes the total microbiome across different body compartments (leg, prosoma, hemolymph, book lungs, ovaries, silk glands, midgut, and fecal pellets). Overall, the microbiome differs significantly between populations and individuals, but not between tissue types. The microbiome of the wasp spider Argiope bruennichi features a novel dominant bacterial symbiont, which is abundant in every tissue type in spiders from geographically distinct populations, and present in offspring. The novel symbiont is affiliated with the Tenericutes, but has low sequence identity (<85%) to all previously named taxa, suggesting that the novel symbiont represents a new bacterial clade. Its presence in offspring implies that it is vertically transmitted. Our results shed light on the processes which shape microbiome differentiation in this species, and raise several questions about the implications of the novel dominant bacterial symbiont on the biology and evolution of its host.",

    "abstract": "The majority of cortical synapses are local and excitatory. Local recurrent circuits could implement amplification, allowing for pattern completion and other computations1. Cortical circuits contain subnetworks, consisting of neurons with similar receptive fields and elevated connectivity relative to the network average2,3. Understanding the computations performed by these subnetworks during behavior has been hampered by the fact that cortical neurons encoding different types of information are spatially intermingled and distributed over large brain volumes 4,5. We used computational modeling, optical recordings and manipulations to probe the function of recurrent coupling in layer (L) 2/3 of the somatosensory cortex during tactile discrimination. A model of L2/3 dynamics revealed that recurrent excitation enhances sensory signals via amplification, but only for subnetwork with elevated connectivity. Networks with high amplification were sensitive to damage: loss of a few subnetwork members degraded stimulus encoding. We tested this prediction experimentally by mapping neuronal selectivity5 and photoablating6,7 neurons with specific selectivity. In L2/3 of the somatosensory cortex, ablating a small proportion (10-20, < 5 % of the total) of neurons representing touch dramatically reduced responses in the spared touch representation, but not other representations. Network models further predicted that degradation following ablation should be greatest among spared neurons with stimulus responses that were most similar to the ablated population. Consistent with this prediction, ablations most strongly impacted neurons with selectivity similar to the ablated population. Our data shows that recurrence among cortical neurons with similar selectivity can drive input-specific amplification during behavior.",

    "abstract": "Both spike rate and timing can transmit information in the brain. Phase response curves (PRCs) quantify how a neuron transforms input to output by spike timing. They exhibit strong firing-rate adaptation, but its mechanism and relevance for network output are poorly understood. Using our Purkinje cell (PC) model we demonstrate that the rate adaptation is caused by rate-dependent subthreshold membrane potentials efficiently regulating the activation of Na+ channels. Then we use a realistic PC network model to examine how rate-dependent responses synchronize spikes in the scenario of reciprocal inhibition-caused high-frequency oscillations. The changes in PRC cause oscillations and spike correlations only at high firing rates. The causal role of the PRC is confirmed using a simpler coupled oscillator network model. This mechanism enables transient oscillations between fast-spiking neurons that thereby form PC assemblies. Our work demonstrates that rate adaptation of PRCs can spatio-temporally organize the PC input to cerebellar nuclei.",

    "abstract": "Oligomeric forms of amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) peptide are known to be the primary neurotoxic species in Alzheimers disease (AD), but how they interact with neurons to produce their deleterious effects is unclear. Over ten different cell-surface receptors for A{beta} have been described, but their molecular interactions with A{beta} assemblies and their relative contributions to mediating AD pathology have remained uncertain. In the present work, we have used super-resolution microscopy to directly visualize A{beta}-receptor interactions at the nanometer scale. We report that one documented A{beta} receptor, the cellular prion protein, PrPC, specifically inhibits the polymerization A{beta} fibrils via a unique mechanism in which it binds specifically to the rapidly growing end of each fibril, thereby blocking polarized elongation at that end. PrPC binds neurotoxic oligomers and protofibrils in a similar fashion, suggesting that it may recognize a common, end-specific, structural motif on all of these assemblies. Finally, two other candidate A{beta} receptors, Fc{gamma}RIIb and LilrB2, affect A{beta} fibril growth in a manner similar to PrPC. Taken together, our results suggest that neurotoxic signaling by several different receptors may be activated by common molecular interactions with both fibrillar and oligomeric A{beta} ligands. Targeting such interactions with small molecules represents an attractive therapeutic strategy for treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "Protein phosphorylation regulates numerous cellular processes and is highly studied in biology.However, the analysis of phosphoproteomic datasets remains challenging due to limited information on upstream regulators of phosphosites, which is fragmented across multiple curated databases and unstructured literature. When aggregating information on phosphosites from six databases and three text mining systems, we found that a substantial proportion of phosphosites were mentioned at residue positions not matching the reference sequence. These errors were often attributable to the use of residue numbers from non-canonical protein isoforms, mouse or rat proteins, or post-translationally processed proteins. Non-canonical site numbering is also prevalent in mass spectrometry datasets from large-scale efforts such as the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC). To address these issues, we developed ProtMapper, an open-source Python tool that automatically normalizes site positions to human protein reference sequences. We used ProtMapper coupled with the INDRA knowledge assembly system to create a corpus of 37,028 regulatory annotations for 16,332 sites - to our knowledge, the most comprehensive corpus of literature-derived information about phosphosite regulation currently available. This work highlights how automated phosphosite normalization coupled to text mining and knowledge assembly allows researchers to leverage phosphosite information that exists within the scientific literature.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMuscle wasting is a debilitating co-morbidity affecting most advanced cancer patients. Alongside enhanced muscle catabolism, defects in muscle repair/regeneration contribute to cancer-associated wasting. Among the factors implicated in suppression of muscle regeneration are cytokines that interfere with myogenic signal transduction pathways. Less understood is how other cancer/wasting-associated cues, such as metabolites, contribute to muscle dysfunction. This study investigates how the metabolite succinate affects myogenesis and muscle regeneration.\n\nMethodsWe leveraged an established ectopic metabolite treatment (cell permeable dimethyl-succinate) strategy to evaluate the ability of intracellular succinate elevation to 1) affect myoblast homeostasis (proliferation, apoptosis), 2) disrupt protein dynamics and induce wasting-associated atrophy, and 3) modulate in vitro myogenesis. In vivo succinate supplementation experiments (2% succinate, 1% sucrose vehicle) were used to corroborate and extend in vitro observations. Metabolic profiling and functional metabolic studies were then performed to investigate the impact of succinate elevation on mitochondria function.\n\nResultsWe found that in vitro succinate supplementation elevated intracellular succinate about 2-fold, and did not have an impact on proliferation or apoptosis of C2C12 myoblasts. Elevated succinate had minor effects on protein homeostasis ([~]25% decrease in protein synthesis assessed by OPP staining), and no significant effect on myotube atrophy. Succinate elevation interfered with in vitro myoblast differentiation, characterized by significant decreases in late markers of myogenesis and fewer nuclei per myosin heavy chain positive structure (assessed by immunofluorescence staining). While mice orally administered succinate did not exhibit changes in overall body composition or whole muscle weights, these mice displayed smaller muscle myofiber diameters ([~]6% decrease in the mean of non-linear regression curves fit to the histograms of minimum feret diameter distribution), which was exacerbated when muscle regeneration was induced with barium chloride injury. Significant decreases in the mean of non-linear regression curves fit to the histograms of minimum feret diameter distributions were observed 7 days and 28 days post injury. Elevated numbers of myogenin positive cells (3-fold increase) supportive of the differentiation defects observed in vitro were observed 28 days post injury. Metabolic profiling and functional metabolic assessment of myoblasts revealed that succinate elevation caused both widespread metabolic changes and significantly lowered maximal cellular respiration ([~]35% decrease).\n\nConclusionsThis study broadens the repertoire of wasting-associated factors that can directly modulate muscle progenitor cell function and strengthens the hypothesis that metabolic derangements are significant contributors to impaired muscle regeneration, an important aspect of cancer-associated muscle wasting.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGuinea worm - Dracunculus medinensis - was historically one of the major parasites of humans and has been known since antiquity. Now, Guinea worm is on the brink of eradication, as efforts to interrupt transmission have reduced the annual burden of disease from millions of infections per year in the 1980s to only 30 human cases reported globally last year. Despite the enormous success of eradication efforts to date, one complication has arisen. Over the last few years, hundreds of dogs have been found infected with this previously apparently anthroponotic parasite, almost all in Chad. Moreover, the relative numbers of infections in humans and dogs suggests that dogs may be key in maintaining transmission in that country.\\n\\nResultsIn an effort to shed light on this peculiar epidemiology of Guinea worm in Chad, we have sequenced and compared the genomes of worms from dog, human and other animal infections. Confirming previous work with other molecular markers, we show that all of these worms are D. medinensis, and that the same population of worms are causing both infections, can confirm the suspected transmission between host species and detect signs of a population bottleneck due to the eradication efforts. The diversity of worms in Chad appears to exclude the possibility that there were no, or very few, worms present in the country during a 10-year absence of reported cases.\\n\\nConclusionsThis work reinforces the importance of adequate surveillance of both human and dog populations in the Guinea worm eradication campaign and suggests that control programs should stay aware of the possible emergence of unusual epidemiology as they approach elimination.",

Population resequencing revealed the divergence between wild and cultivars at about 6000 years ago.

Noticeably, one candidate locus for fruit size locates within a region missing from a recent Illumina-based assembly.

    "abstract": "ObjectiveCombinatorial gut hormone therapy is one of the more promising strategies for identifying improved treatments for metabolic disease. Many approaches combine the established benefits of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonism with one or more additional molecules with the aim of improving metabolic outcomes. Recent attention has been drawn to the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) system due to compelling pre-clinical evidence describing the metabolic benefits of antagonising the GIP receptor (GIPR). We rationalised that benefit might be accrued from combining GIPR antagonism with GLP-1 agonism. To this end we investigated the metabolic effects of co-administration of previously reported peptide-based GIPR antagonists with the GLP-1 agonist liraglutide.\n\nMethodsTwo GIPR peptide antagonists, GIPA-1 (mouse GIP(3-30)NH2) and GIPA-2 (NAc-K10[{gamma}E{gamma}E-C16]-Arg18-hGIP(5-42)), were pharmacologically characterised in vitro in an assay measuring cAMP production in CHO-K1 cells overexpressing the mouse GIPR. These peptides were then characterised in vivo in lean mice for their effect on oral glucose tolerance, as well as their ability to antagonize exogenous GIP action. Finally, a mouse model of diet-induced obesity (DIO) was used to investigate the potential metabolic benefits of chronic dosing of peptide-based GIPR antagonists, alone or in combination with liraglutide.\n\nResultsIn vitro, both GIPR peptides exhibited potent antagonistic properties, with GIPA-2 being the more potent of the two. Acute in vivo administration of GIPA-1 during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) had negligible effects on glucose tolerance and circulated insulin in lean mice. In contrast, GIPA-2 impaired glucose tolerance and attenuated circulating insulin levels, with offsetting effects on glycemia noted with co-administration with exogenous mouse GIP, suggesting true antagonism via GIPA-2 at the GIP receptor. Chronic administration studies in a DIO mouse model showed expected effects of GLP-1 agonism (via liraglutide), lowering food intake, body weight, fasting blood glucose and plasma insulin concentrations while improving glucose sensitivity, whereas delivery of either GIPR antagonist alone had negligible effects on these parameters. Interestingly, chronic dual therapy with the GIPR antagonists and GLP-1 showed separation from single intervention arms though augmented insulin sensitizing effects (modestly lowering insulin and HOMA-IR) and lowering plasmas triglycerides and free-fatty acids, with more notable effects observed with GIPA-1 compared to GIPA-2.\n\nConclusionWe conclude that, in contrast to the well-documented effects of GLP-1R agonism, systemic administration of peptide-based GIPR antagonists demonstrate minimal benefit on metabolic parameters in DIO mice, exhibiting no major effects on body weight, food intake and glycaemic parameters. However, the co-administration of both a GIPR antagonist together with a GLP1 agonist uncovers interesting synergistic and beneficial effects on measures of insulin sensitivity, circulating lipids and certain adipose stores that seem influenced by the degree or nature of GIP receptor antagonism.",

In the presence of long, temporally structured dynamic stimuli, higher invariance should imply temporally persistent representations at the top of this functional hierarchy. However, such stimuli could engage adaptive and predictive processes, whose impact on neural coding dynamics is unknown. By probing the rat analogue of the ventral stream with movies, we uncovered a hierarchy of temporal scales, with deeper areas encoding visual information more persistently. Furthermore, the impact of intrinsic dynamics on the stability of stimulus representations gradually grew along the hierarchy. Analysis of a large dataset of recordings from the mouse visual hierarchy yielded similar trends, revealing also their dependence on the behavioral state of the animal. Overall, these findings show that visual representations become progressively more stable along rodent visual processing hierarchies, with an important contribution provided by intrinsic processing.",

White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are a common finding on MRI usually indicative of cerebrovascular disease and have been associated with certain NPS. The aim of this study was two-fold. Firstly, we assessed the relationship between WMH load and NPS severity in MCI due to AD (MCI-AD) and AD. Secondly, we assessed the ability of WMH to predict the development and progression of NPS in these participants. Data was obtained from the National Alzheimers Coordinating Center.\\n\\nMethodsWMH were obtained from baseline MRIs and quantified using an automated segmentation technique. NPS were measured using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Mixed effect models and correlations were used to determine the relationship between WMH load and NPS severity scores.\\n\\nResultsCross-sectional analysis showed no significant association between NPS and WMH at baseline. Longitudinal mixed effect models, however, revealed a significant relationship between increase in NPI total scores and baseline WMH load (p=0.014). There was also a significant relationship between increase in irritability severity scores over time and baseline WMH load (p= 0.009). Trends were observed for a relationship between increase in agitation severity scores and baseline WMH load (p=0.058). No other NPS severity scores were significantly associated with baseline WMH load. The correlation plot analysis showed that baseline whole brain WMH predicted change in future NPI total scores (r=0.169, p=0.008). Baseline whole brain WMH also predicted change in future agitation severity scores (r= 0.165, p= 0.009). The temporal lobe WMH (r=0.169, p=0.008) and frontal lobe WMH (r=0.153, p=0.016) contributed most to this this change.\\n\\nConclusionIrritability and agitation are common NPS and very distressful to patients and caregivers. Our findings of an increase in irritability severity over time as well as higher agitation severity scores at follow-up in participants with MCI-AD and AD with increased WMH loads have important implications for treatment, arguing for aggressive treatment of vascular risk factors in patients with MCI-AD and AD.",

    "abstract": "High throughput data is commonplace in biomedical research as seen with technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and other Next Generation Sequencing technologies. As these techniques continue to be increasingly utilized it is critical to have analysis tools that can identify meaningful complex relationships between variables (i.e., in the case of scRNA-seq: genes) in a way such that human bias is absent. Moreover, it is equally paramount that both linear and non-linear (i.e., one-to-many) variable relationships be considered when contrasting datasets. HD Spot is a deep learning-based framework that generates an optimal interpretable classifier a given high-throughput dataset using a simple genetic algorithm as well as an autoencoder to classifier transfer learning approach. Using four unique publicly available scRNA-seq datasets with published ground truth, we demonstrate the robustness of HD Spot and the ability to identify ontologically accurate gene lists for a given data subset. HD Spot serves as a bioinformatic tool to allow novice and advanced analysts to gain complex insight into their respective datasets enabling novel hypotheses development.",

Assessing  lake health across large geographic scales is critical to predict the stability of their ecosystem services and their vulnerability to anthropogenic disturbances. The LakePulse research network is tasked with the assessment of lake health across gradients of land use on a continental scale. Bacterial communities are an integral and rapidly responding component of lake ecosystems, yet large-scale responses to anthropogenic activity remain elusive. Here, we assess the ecological impact of land use on bacterial communities from 220 lakes covering more than 660 000 km2 across Eastern Canada. Alteration of communities was found on every level examined including richness, community composition, community network structure and indicator taxa of high or low lake water quality. Specifically, increasing anthropogenic impact within the watershed lowered richness mediated by changes in salinity. Likewise, community composition was significantly correlated with agriculture and urban development within a watershed. Interaction networks showed decreasing complexity and fewer keystone taxa in impacted lakes. Together, these findings point to vast bacterial community changes of largely unknown consequences induced by human activity within lake watersheds.\n\nSignificance StatementLakes play central roles in Earths ecosystems and are sentinels of climate change and other watershed alterations. Assessing lake health across large geographic scales is therefore critical to predict ecosystem stability and lake vulnerability to anthropogenic disturbances.

Bacterial communities are an integral and rapidly responding component of lake ecosystems, yet their large-scale responses to anthropogenic activity remain unknown. Here, we assessed the anthropogenic impact on bacterial communities of over 200 lakes located across large environmental gradients.

    "abstract": "We explore sequence determinants of enzyme activity and specificity in a major enzyme family of terpene synthases. Most enzymes in this family catalyze reactions that produce cyclic terpenes - complex hydrocarbons widely used by plants and insects in diverse biological processes such as defense, communication, and symbiosis. To analyze the molecular mechanisms of emergence of terpene cyclization, we have carried out in-depth examination of mutational space around (E)-{beta}-farnesene synthase, an Artemisia annua enzyme which catalyzes production of a linear hydrocarbon chain. Each mutant enzyme in our synthetic libraries was characterized biochemically, and the resulting reaction rate data was used as input to the Michaelis-Menten model of enzyme kinetics, in which free energies were represented as sums of one-amino-acid contributions and two-amino-acid couplings. Our model predicts measured reaction rates with high accuracy and yields free energy landscapes characterized by relatively few coupling terms. As a result, the Michaelis-Menten free energy landscapes have simple, interpretable structure and exhibit little epistasis. We have also developed biophysical fitness models based on the assumption that highly fit enzymes have evolved to maximize the output of correct products, such as cyclic products or a specific product of interest, while minimizing the output of byproducts. This approach results in a non-linear fitness landscape which is considerably more epistatic. Overall, our experimental and computational framework provides focused characterization of evolutionary emergence of novel enzymatic functions in the context of micro-evolutionary exploration of sequence space around naturally occurring enzymes.",

We used electrophysiology and fiber photometry to record DA signals in two mesostriatal pathways as thirsty male songbirds sang alone and to females. When alone, water reward signals were observed globally but singing-related performance error signals were restricted to a song-specialized mesostriatal pathway. During courtship singing, DA responses to both water-predicting cues and song performance outcomes diminished, and DA signals in the song pathway were instead driven by female calls timed with the male song. Thus DA signals are dynamically gated and routed through distinct pathways as animals change their priorities in response to a courtship opportunity.",

However, the pathway underlying the light effect on mood remains unclear. Since a retino-raphe pathway was previously indicated to modulate 5-HT production, we hypothesize that the retinal projection into dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) may play an important role in the light therapy for depression.\\n\\nMethodsA rat model of 14-day corticosterone administration (40 mg/kg/day subcutaneous injection) was mainly used to test the effect of light therapy on non-seasonal depressant-like behavior, and the involved neural circuitry and neurochemistry as well.\\n\\nResultsBehavior results revealed that the bright light therapy especially with the blue light of 470 nm and 400 lux, effectively reversed the depression-like responses in those stressed rats. After elimination of retino-raphe projection using immunotoxin (Saporin) the effect of light therapy was significantly attenuated. Whereas activation of retino-raphe projection using HM3q chemogenetics was shown an effect similar to fluoxetine treatment. Furthermore, 5-HT3A positive GABA cells in the DRN were activated with high c-Fos expression that involved in an inhibition of 5-HT synthesis and a subsequent depressive behavior. While light therapy through retino-raphe projection deactivated the hyperaction of those GABA cells in the DRN; that eventually contributed to the antidepressant effect from light therapy.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results indicate that the retino-raphe circuitry engaged antidepressant effect in DRN that contributed to the light therapy to the non-seasonal depression. 5-HT3A positive GABA cells in DRN was indicated to mediate this function of retino-raphe projection.",

    "abstract": "Cortical volumetric analysis is widely used to study the anatomic basis of neurological deficits in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, patients with TBI-related lesions are often excluded from analysis, because cortical lesions may compromise the accuracy of reconstructed surfaces upon which volumetric measurements are based. Here, we propose a novel FreeSurfer-based lesion correction method and illustrate its impact on cortical volume measures in patients with chronic moderate-to-severe TBI. We performed MRI in 87 patients at mean+/-SD 10.9+/-9.1 years post-injury using a T1-weighted multi-echo MPRAGE sequence at 1 mm resolution. Following surface reconstruction, we parcellated the cerebral cortex into seven functional networks using FreeSurfers standard pipeline. Next, we manually labeled vertices on the cortical surface where lesions caused inaccuracies and removed them from network-based cortical volumetric measures. After performing this lesion correction procedure, we measured the surface area of lesion overlap with each network and the percent volume of each network affected by lesions. We identified 120 lesions that caused inaccuracies in the cortical surface in 46 patients. In these 46 patients, the most commonly lesioned networks were the limbic and default mode networks (95.7% each), followed by the executive control (78.3%), and salience (71.7%) networks. The limbic network had the largest average surface area of lesion overlap (4.4+/-3.7%) and the largest percent volume affected by lesions (12.7+/-9.7%). The lesion correction method has the potential to improve the accuracy of cortical volumetric measurements and permit inclusion of patients with lesioned brains in quantitative analyses, providing new opportunities to elucidate network-based mechanisms of neurological deficits in patients with TBI.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND and AIMS Extra-hepatic biliary atresia (BA) is a pediatric liver disease with no approved medical therapy. Recent studies using human samples and experimental modeling suggest that glutathione redox metabolism and heterogeneity play a role in disease pathogenesis. We sought to dissect the mechanistic basis of liver redox variation and explore how other stress responses affect cholangiocyte injury in BA.METHODS We performed quantitative in situ hepatic glutathione redox mapping in zebrafish larvae carrying targeted mutations in glutathione metabolism genes and correlated these findings with sensitivity to the plant-derived BA-linked toxin biliatresone. We also determined whether genetic disruption of HSP90 protein quality control pathway genes implicated in human BA altered biliatresone toxicity in zebrafish and human cholangiocytes. An in vivo screen of a known drug library was performed to identify novel modifiers of cholangiocyte injury in the zebrafish experimental BA model with subsequent validation.RESULTS Glutathione metabolism gene mutations caused regionally distinct changes in the redox potential of cholangiocytes that differentially sensitized them to biliatresone. Disruption of human BA-implicated HSP90 pathway genes sensitized zebrafish and human cholangiocytes to biliatresone-induced injury independent of glutathione. Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5i) and other cGMP signaling activators worked synergistically with the glutathione precursor N- acetylcysteine (NAC) in preventing biliatresone-induced injury in zebrafish and human cholangiocytes. PDE5i enhanced proteasomal degradation and required intact HSP90 chaperone.CONCLUSION Regional variation in glutathione metabolism underlies sensitivity to the biliary toxin biliatresone, and mirrors recently reported BA risk stratification linked to glutathione metabolism gene expression. Human BA can be causatively linked to genetic modulation of protein quality control. Combined treatment with NAC and cGMP signaling enhancers warrants further investigation as therapy for BA.Background and Context Biliary atresia (BA) is an obstructive fibrosing cholangiopathy that is the leading indication for liver transplantation in the pediatric population. There are no known treatments to prevent progressive liver injury after surgical restoration of bile flow.New Findings The authors identify factors that affect susceptibility of cholangiocytes to oxidative injury using a toxin-induced BA model. This information is used to validate genetic risk factors for human BA and identified PDE5i as a potential treatment for biliary atresia, either on its own or in combination with the anti-oxidant N-acetyl-cysteine.Limitations The work done in animal and cell culture models needs further study in human tissue-derived models and a larger cohort of BA patients.Impact The findings from this study provide a rationale for identifying new genetic risk factors that predispose to BA and for an interventional study to prevent progressive liver injury in this enigmatic disease.Short Summary This study uses zebrafish and human cell culture models to identify novel injury mechanisms, genetic risk factors and new therapies for the pediatric liver disease biliary atresia.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Abbreviations17-AAG7-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin;BAbiliary atresia;bilbiliatresone;8-Br-cGMP8-Bromoguanosine 3\u2019,5\u2019-cyclic monophosphate;EHCextrahepatic cholangiocytes;Gclglutamate cysteine ligase;GGAgeranylgeranyl acetate;gsrglutathione reductase;GSHreduced glutathione;GSSGoxidized glutathione;IHCintrahepatic cholangiocytes;NACN-acetylcysteine;PDE5iPhosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors;PQCprotein quality control;WTwild-typeView Full Text",

    "abstract": "Over the last decade, several studies have revealed the enormous potential of RNA-silencing strategies as a potential alternative to conventional pesticides for plant protection. We have previously shown that targeted gene silencing mediated by an in planta expression of non-coding inhibitory double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) can protect host plants against various diseases with unprecedented efficiency. In addition to the generation of RNA-silencing (RNAi) signals in planta, plants can be protected from pathogens and pests by spray-applied RNA-based biopesticides. Despite the striking efficiency of RNA-silencing-based technologies holds for agriculture, the molecular mechanisms underlying spray-induced gene silencing (SIGS) strategies are virtually unresolved, a requirement for successful future application in the field. Based on our previous work, we predict that the molecular mechanism of SIGS is controlled by the fungal-silencing machinery. In this study, we used SIGS to compare the silencing efficiencies of computationally-designed versus manually-designed dsRNA constructs targeting ARGONAUTE and DICER genes of Fusarium graminearum (Fg). We found that targeting key components of the fungal RNAi machinery via SIGS could protect barley leaves from Fg infection and that the manual design of dsRNAs resulted in higher gene-silencing efficiencies than the tool-based design. Moreover, our results indicate the possibility of cross-kingdom RNA silencing in the Fg-barley interaction, a phenomenon in which sRNAs operate as effector molecules to induce gene silencing between species from different kingdoms, such as a plant host and their interacting pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Targeted cancer drugs often elicit powerful initial responses, but generally fail to deliver long-term benefit due to the emergence of resistant cells1,2. This is thought to be the consequence of strong selective pressure exerted on the cancer drug target by a Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of a drug3-5. We hypothesized that partial inhibition of multiple components in the same oncogenic signalling pathway might add up to complete pathway inhibition, while at the same time decreasing the selective pressure on each individual component to acquire a resistance mutation. We report here testing of this Multiple Low Dose (MLD) model of drug administration in Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We show that as little as 20% of the individual drug doses required for full inhibition of cell viability is sufficient to completely block MAPK signalling and proliferation when used in 3D (RAF+MEK+ERK inhibitors) or 4D (EGFR+RAF+MEK+ERK inhibitors) combinations. Importantly, EGFR mutant NSCLC cells treated with EGFR inhibitors at a high dose rapidly developed resistance in vitro, but the cells treated with 3D or 4D MLD therapy did not. Moreover, NSCLC cells that had gained resistance to high dose anti-EGFR therapies were still sensitive to MLD therapy. Using several animal models, including patient derived xenografts of NSCLC tumours that are resistant to EGFR inhibitors erlotinib and osimertinib6,7, we found durable responses to MLD therapy without associated toxicity. These data support the notion that partial inhibition of multiple components of cancer-activated signalling pathways is difficult to circumvent and suggest that MLD therapy could deliver clinical benefit. We propose that MLD strategy could be an effective treatment option for EGFR mutant NSCLC patients, especially those having acquired resistance to even third generation EGFR inhibitor therapy.",

    "abstract": "Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing is an essential posttranscriptional modification catalyzed by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR)1 and ADAR2 in mammals. For numerous sites in coding sequences (CDS) and microRNAs (miRNAs), editing is highly conserved and has significant biological consequences, for example, by altering amino acid residues and target recognition. However, technical limitations have prevented a comprehensive and quantitative study to determine how specific ADARs contribute to each site. Here, we developed a simple method in which each RNA region with an editing site was amplified separately and combined for deep sequencing. Using this method, we compared the editing ratios of all sites that were either definitely or possibly conserved in CDS and miRNAs in the cerebral cortex and spleen of wild-type mice, Adar1E861A/E861AIfih-/- mice expressing inactive ADAR1 (Adar1 KI) and Adar2-/-Gria2R/R (Adar2 KO) mice. We found that the editing ratio was frequently upregulated in either Adar mutant mouse strain. In contrast, we found that the presence of both ADAR1 and ADAR2 was required for the efficient editing of specific sites. In addition, some sites, such as miR-3099-3p, showed no preference for either ADAR. We further created double mutant Adar1 KI Adar2 KO mice and observed viable and fertile animals with complete absence of editing, suggesting that ADAR1 and ADAR2 are the sole enzymes responsible for all editing sites in vivo. Collectively, these findings indicate that editing is regulated in a site-specific manner by the different interplay between ADAR1 and ADAR2.",

    "abstract": "Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are proton-gated cation channels that contribute to neurotransmission, as well as initiation of pain and neuronal death following ischemic stroke. As such, there is a great interest in understanding the in vivo regulation of ASICs, especially by endogenous neuropeptides that potently modulate ASICs. The most potent endogenous ASIC modulator known to date is the opioid neuropeptide big dynorphin (BigDyn). BigDyn is upregulated in chronic pain and increases ASIC-mediated neuronal death during acidosis. Understanding the mechanism and site of action of BigDyn on ASICs could thus enable the rational design of compounds potentially useful in the treatment of pain and ischemic stroke. To this end, we employ a combination of electrophysiology, voltage-clamp fluorometry, synthetic BigDyn analogs and non-canonical amino acid-mediated photocrosslinking. We demonstrate that BigDyn binding results in an ASIC1a closed resting conformation that is distinct from open and desensitized states induced by protons. Using alanine-substituted BigDyn analogs, we find that the BigDyn modulation of ASIC1a is mediated through electrostatic interactions of basic amino acids in the BigDyn N-terminus. Furthermore, neutralizing acidic amino acids in the ASIC1a extracellular domain reduces BigDyn effects, suggesting a binding site at the acidic pocket. This is confirmed by photocrosslinking using the non-canonical amino acid azido-phenylalanine. Overall, our data define the mechanism of how BigDyn modulates ASIC1a, identify the acidic pocket as the binding site for BigDyn and thus highlight this cavity as an important site for the development of ASIC-targeting therapeutics.\n\nSignificance StatementNeuropeptides such as big dynorphin (BigDyn) play important roles in the slow modulation of fast neurotransmission, which is mediated by membrane-embedded receptors. In fact, BigDyn is the most potent known endogenous modulator of one such receptor, the acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC), but the mode of action remains unknown. In this work, we employ a broad array of technologies to unravel the details of where big dynorphin binds to ASIC and how it modulates its activity. As both BigDyn and ASIC are implicated in pain pathways, this work might pave the way towards future analgesics.",

    "abstract": "Small molecule inhibitors of purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) have been explored as a treatment strategy for leukemia and lymphoma, however, the determinants of response to this class of drugs are incompletely understood. PNP inhibitors impair cell proliferation by preventing catabolism of the nucleoside deoxyguanosine (dG) which induces toxic imbalances amongst intracellular deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) pools following its phosphorylation and trapping by nucleoside kinases. We hypothesized that differential nucleoside uptake or catabolism defines cancer cell lines as either sensitive or resistant to PNP inhibition. Among cancer cell lines we found that T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells are uniquely and acutely sensitive to PNP inhibition whereas the B-cell leukemia and solid tumor models are completely resistant. We determined that although the nucleoside scavenging kinase deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) was active in all cells tested, PNP inhibitors only induced dGTP pool increases in sensitive models. By evaluating the expression of key genes involved in nucleotide scavenging, biosynthesis, and phosphohydrolysis in a panel of sensitive and resistant cell lines we found that the dNTP phosphohydrolase SAM histidine aspartate containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) was exclusively expressed in resistant models. Using CRISPR/Cas9 SAMHD1 knockout cell lines, we verified that PNP inhibitor sensitivity is a function of SAMHD1 expression and determined that the pharmacological inhibition of dCK or genetic restoration of SAMHD1 conferred resistance to PNP inhibition. Importantly, we determined that low expression of SAMHD1 is not limited to T-ALL as subset of established and primary solid tumors models are SAMHD1-deficient. These solid tumor models were consistently acutely sensitive to PNP inhibitors which indicates that the utility of PNP inhibitors extends beyond hematological malignancies. Additionally, we found that deoxycytidine (dC) can limit the anti-proliferative effects of PNP inhibitors by competing with dG for phosphorylation by dCK but this effect can be overcome by expression of dC-catabolizing gene cytidine deaminase (CDA). Collectively, these results indicate that SAMHD1, dCK and CDA are critical biomarkers that must be used to stratify patients in clinical trials evaluating pharmacological PNP inhibition.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe most common type of metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is an inherited lysosomal disorder caused by recessive mutations in ARSA. The biological process of MLD disease caused by candidate pathogenic mutations in the ARSA gene remains unclear.\\n\\nMethodsWe used whole-exome sequencing (WES) and Sanger sequencing to identify the pathogenic mutation in a Chinese family. Literature review and protein three-dimensional structure prediction were performed to analyse the potential pathogenesis of the identified mutations. Overexpression cell models of wild-type and mutated ARSA genes were constructed to obtain expression profiles, and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), hub gene detection and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis were carried out to compare the biological changes caused by candidate pathogenic mutations.\\n\\nResultsWe identified an ARSA c.925G>A homozygous mutation from a Chinese late-infantile MLD patient, the first report of this mutation in Asia. According to the literature and protein structure analysis, three mutations of c.925G (c.925G>A, c.925G>T, c.925G>C) in the ARSA gene were pathogenic. The transcriptome of four ARSA overexpression cell models (c.925G, c.925G>A, c.925G>T, c.925G>C) were analysed by WGCNA, Hub genes and PPI complexes.RNA-seq and bioinformatics results indicate that the mutations at c.925G cause comprehensive molecular changes related to energy metabolism, ion binding, vesicle transport and transport.\\n\\nConclusionWe identified a pathogenic mutation, ARSA homozygosity c.925G>A, from a Chinese MLD family. All three mutations of c.925G in the ARSA gene are pathogenic and may cause disease by dysregulating the molecular processes of ion binding, vesicle transport and ion transport.",

    "abstract": "Population receptive field (pRF) modelling is a common technique for estimating the stimulus-selectivity of populations of neurons using neuroimaging. Here, we aimed to address if pRF properties estimated with this method depend on the spatio-temporal structure and the predictability of the mapping stimulus. We mapped the polar angle preference and tuning width of voxels in visual cortex (V1-V4) of healthy, adult volunteers. We compared sequences orderly sweeping through the visual field or jumping from location to location employing stimuli of different width (45{degrees} vs 6{degrees}) and cycles of variable duration (8s vs 60s). While we did not observe any systematic influence of stimulus predictability, the temporal structure of the sequences significantly affected tuning width estimates. Ordered designs with large wedges and short cycles produced systematically smaller estimates than random sequences. Interestingly, when we used small wedges and long cycles, we obtained larger tuning width estimates for ordered than random sequences. We suggest that, ordered and random mapping protocols show different susceptibility to other design choices such as stimulus type and duration of the mapping cycle and can produce significantly different pRF results.",

In this work samples collected from symptomatic plants were analyzed by NGS technique and a complex virome composed by viruses members of the Betaflexiviridae and Fimoviridae families was identified. In particular, the genomic fragments typical of the emaravirus group were organized in the genomes of two new emaraviruses species, tentatively named Camellia japonica associated emaravirus 1 and 2. They are the first emaraviruses described in camellia plants and were always found solely in symptomatic plants. On the contrary, in both symptomatic and asymptomatic plants, we detected five betaflexiviruses isolates that, based on aa identitiy comparisons, can be classified in two new putative species called Camellia japonica associated betaflexivirus 1 and Camellia japonica associated betaflexivirus 2. Together with other recently identified betaflexiviruses associated to Camellia japonica disease, the betaflexiviruses characterized in this study show an unusual hyper-conservation of the coat protein at aminoacidic level.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundClostridioides difficile is an enteric pathogen historically known to cause hospital associated (HA)-infections in humans. A major risk factor for CDI in humans is antibiotic usage as it alters the gut microbiota and there is a loss of colonization resistance against C. difficile. In recent years there has been an increase in community associated (CA)-C. difficile infection that does not have the same risk factors as HA-CDI. Potential sources of CA-CDI have been proposed and include animals, food, water, and the environment, however these sources remain poorly investigated. Here, we define the prevalence of C. difficile strains found in different companion animals (canines, felines, and equines) to investigate a potential zoonotic link. C. difficile strains were identified by toxin gene profiling, fluorescent PCR ribotyping, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. 16s rRNA gene sequencing was done on animal feces to investigate the relationship between the presence of C. difficile and the gut microbiota in different hosts.\\n\\nResultsHere, we show that C. difficile was recovered from 20.9% of samples (42/201), which included 33 canines, 2 felines, and 7 equines. Over 69% (29/42) of the isolates were toxigenic and belonged to 14 different ribotypes, with overlap between HA- and CA-CDI cases in humans. The presence of C. difficile results in a shift in the fecal microbial community structure in both canines and equines. Commensal Clostridia C. hiranonis was negatively associated with C. difficile in canines. Further experimentation showed a clear antagonistic relationship between the two strains in vitro, suggesting that commensal Clostridia might play a role in colonization resistance against C. difficile in different hosts.\\n\\nConclusionsIn this study we investigated a potentially important source of C. difficile transmission: the companion animal population. C. difficile carriage was common in dogs, cats, and horses. C. difficile isolates from companion animals included many of the same ribotypes known to cause HA- and CA-CDI in humans, and had similar antimicrobial resistance profiles as those isolated from human populations. These data contribute to our understanding of non-hospital exposure to C. difficile in the human population and suggest new avenues for reducing C. difficile prevalence in companion animals and, perhaps, thereby reducing CA-CDI in humans.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesMethionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS) inhibitors are under investigation for the treatment of intestinal infections caused by Giardia lamblia. To properly analyze the therapeutic potential of the MetRS inhibitor 1717, experimental tools including a robust cell-based assay and a murine model of infection were developed based on novel strains of G. lamblia that employ luciferase reporter systems to quantify viable parasites.\\n\\nMethodsSystematic screening of Giardia-specific promoters and luciferase variants led to the development of a strain expressing the click beetle green luciferase. Further modifying this strain to express NanoLuc created a dual reporter strain capable of quantifying parasites in both the trophozoite and cyst stages. These strains were used to develop a high throughput cell assay and a mouse infection model. A library of MetRS inhibitors was screened in the cell assay and 1717 was tested for efficacy in the mouse infection model.\\n\\nResultsCell viability in in vitro compound screens was quantified via bioluminescence readouts while infection loads in mice were monitored with noninvasive whole-animal imaging and fecal analysis. Compound 1717 was effective in clearing mice of Giardia infection in 3 days at varying doses, which is supported by data from enzymatic and phenotypic cell assays.\\n\\nConclusionsThe new in vitro and in vivo assays based on luciferase expression by engineered G. lamblia strains are useful for the discovery and development of new therapeutics for giardiasis. MetRS inhibitors, as validated by 1717, have promising anti-giardiasis properties that merit further study as alternative therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Detection of statistical irregularities, measured as a prediction error response, is fundamental to the perceptual monitoring of the environment. We studied whether prediction error response is associated with neural oscillations or asynchronous broadband activity. Electrocorticography (ECoG) was carried out in three male monkeys, who passively listened to the auditory roving oddball stimuli. Local field potentials (LFP) recorded over the auditory cortex underwent spectral principal component analysis, which decoupled broadband and rhythmic components of the LFP signal. We found that the broadband component captured the prediction error response, whereas none of the rhythmic components were associated with statistical irregularities of sounds. The broadband component displayed more stochastic, asymmetrical multifractal properties than the rhythmic components, which revealed more self-similar dynamics. We thus conclude that the prediction error response is captured by neuronal populations generating asynchronous broadband activity, defined by irregular dynamical states which, unlike oscillatory rhythms, appear to enable the neural representation of auditory prediction error response.\n\nSignificance StatementThis study aimed to examine the contribution of oscillatory and asynchronous components of auditory local field potentials in the generation of prediction error responses to sensory irregularities, as this has not been directly addressed in the previous studies. Here, we show that mismatch negativity - an auditory prediction error response - is driven by the asynchronous broadband component of potentials recorded in the auditory cortex. This finding highlights the importance of non-oscillatory neural processes in the predictive monitoring of the environment. At a more general level, the study demonstrates that stochastic neural processes, which are often disregarded as neural noise, do have a functional role in the processing of sensory information.",

    "abstract": "The current study represents the first comprehensive examination of spatial, temporal and sustained attention following cerebellar damage. Results indicated that, compared to controls, cerebellar damage resulted in a larger cueing effect at the longest SOA - possibly reflecting a slowed the onset of inhibition of return (IOR) during a reflexive covert attention task, and reduced the ability to detect successive targets during an attentional blink task. However, there was little evidence to support the notion that cerebellar damage disrupted voluntary covert attention or the sustained attention to response task (SART). Lesion overlay data and supplementary voxel-based lesion symptom mapping (VLSM) analyses indicated that impaired performance on the reflexive covert attention and attentional blink tasks were related to damage to Crus II of the left posterior cerebellum. In addition, subsequent analyses indicated our results are not due to either general motor impairments or to damage to the deep cerebellar nuclei. Collectively these data demonstrate, for the first time, that the same cerebellar regions may be involved in both spatial and temporal visual attention.",

Phytate, the major form of phosphorus in plant seeds, is known as an indigestible and negligible in humans.

Here we show that excessive intake of phytate with a low-Ca2+ diet fed to rats contributed to the development of crystal nephropathies, renal phosphate wasting, and bone loss through tubular dysfunction secondary to dysregulation of intestinal calcium and phosphate absorption. Moreover, Ca2+ supplementation alleviated the detrimental effects of excess dietary phytate on bone and kidney through excretion of undigested Ca2+-phytate, which prevented a vicious cycle of intestinal phosphate overload and renal phosphate wasting while improving intestinal Ca2+ bioavailability. Thus, we demonstrate that phytate is digestible without a high-Ca2+ diet and a risk factor for phosphate overloading and developing crystal nephropathies and bone disease.",

    "abstract": "Currently, genome-wide data analyses have revealed significant differences between various human naive-like pluripotent states derived from different laboratory protocols, confounding the establishment of defining criteria of human naive pluripotency. Thus, it is imperative to understand the concept concerning the ground or naive pluripotent state of pluripotent stem cells, which was initially established in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Putative human pluripotency has been proposed, largely based on comparing genome-wide transcriptomic signatures of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) with human pre-implantation embryos and mESCs by several research groups. Current bioinformatics approaches, however, have inevitable conceptual biases and technological limitations, including the choices of datasets, analytic methods, and interlaboratory data variability. In this report, we performed a multivariate meta-analysis of major hPSC datasets via the combined analytic powers of percentile normalization, principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), and SC3 consensus clustering. This vigorous bioinformatics approach has significantly improved the predictive values of the current meta-analysis. Accordingly, we were able to reveal various fundamental inconsistencies between naive-like hPSCs and their human and mouse in vitro counterparts, which are likely attributed to interlaboratory protocol differences. Moreover, our meta-analysis failed to provide global transcriptomic markers that support the putative in vitro human naive pluripotent state, rather suggesting the existence of altered pluripotent states under current naive-like hPSC growth protocols.",

    "abstract": "Host-microbe interactions are crucial for normal physiological and immune system development and are implicated in a wide variety of diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), colorectal cancer (CRC), obesity, and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Despite large-scale case-control studies aimed at identifying microbial taxa or specific genes involved in pathogeneses, the mechanisms linking them to disease have thus far remained elusive. To identify potential mechanisms through which human-associated bacteria impact host health, we leveraged publicly-available interspecies protein-protein interaction (PPI) data to find clusters of microbiome-derived proteins with high sequence identity to known human protein interactors. We observe differential targeting of putative human-interacting bacterial genes in metagenomic case-control microbiome studies. In nine independent case studies, we find evidence that the microbiome broadly targets human proteins involved in immune, oncogenic, apoptotic, and endocrine signaling pathways in relation to IBD, CRC, obesity and T2D diagnoses. This host-centric analysis strategy provides a mechanistic hypothesis-generating platform for any metagenomics cohort study and extensively adds human functional annotation to commensal bacterial proteins.\n\nOne-sentence summaryMicrobiome-derived proteins are linked to disease-associated human pathways by metagenomic and protein-protein interaction analyses.",

We investigated associations using general linear models, adjusted for age, gender, and major vascular risk factors.\n\nResultsIn 381 subjects with all measures, increasing total PVS volume and count were associated with decreased CRAE in the left eye (volume {beta}=-0.170, count {beta}=-0.184, p<0.001). No associations of PVS with CRVE were found. The PVS total volume, individual width and size increased with decreasing FD of the arterioles (a) and venules (v) of the left eye (total volume: FDa {beta}=-0.137, FDv {beta}=-0.139, p<0.01; width: FDa {beta}=-0.144, FDv {beta}=-0.158, p<0.01; size: FDa {beta}=-0.157, FDv {beta}=-0.162, p<0.01).\n\nConclusionsIncrease in PVS number and size visible on MRI reflect arteriolar narrowing and lower retinal arteriole and venule branching complexity, both markers of impaired microvascular health. Computationally-derived PVS metrics may be an early indicator of failing vascular health and should be tested in longitudinal studies.",

    "abstract": "Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is composed of thermogenic cells that convert chemical energy into heat to help maintain a constant body temperature and counteract metabolic disease in mammals. The metabolic adaptations required for thermogenesis are not fully understood. Here we explore how steady state levels of metabolic intermediates are altered in brown adipose tissue in response to cold exposure. Transcriptome and metabolome analysis revealed changes in pathways involved in amino acid, glucose, and TCA cycle metabolism. Using isotopic labeling experiments, we found that activated brown adipocytes increased labeling of pyruvate and TCA cycle intermediates from U13C-glucose. Although glucose oxidation has been implicated as being essential for thermogenesis, its requirement for efficient thermogenesis has not been directly tested. Here we show that mitochondrial pyruvate uptake is essential for optimal thermogenesis, as conditional deletion of Mpc1 in brown adipocytes leads to impaired cold adaptation. Isotopic labeling experiments using U13C-glucose showed that loss of MPC1 led to impaired labeling of TCA cycle intermediates, while labeling of glycolytic intermediates was unchanged. Loss of MPC1 in BAT increased 3-hydroxybutyrate levels in blood and BAT in response to the cold, suggesting that ketogenesis provides an alternative fuel source that partially compensates for impaired mitochondrial oxidation of cytosolic pyruvate. Collectively, these studies highlight that complete glucose oxidation is essential for optimal brown fat thermogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Functional connectivity studies have identified at least two large-scale neural systems that constitute cognitive control networks - the frontoparietal network (FPN) and cingulo-opercular network (CON). Control networks are thought to support goal-directed cognition and behavior. It was previously shown that the FPN flexibly shifts its global connectivity pattern according to task goal, consistent with a \"flexible hub\" mechanism for cognitive control. Our aim was to build on this finding to develop a functional cartography (a multi-metric profile) of control networks in terms of dynamic network properties. We quantified network properties in (male and female) humans using a high-control-demand cognitive paradigm involving switching among 64 task sets. We hypothesized that cognitive control is enacted by the FPN and CON via distinct but complementary roles reflected in network dynamics. Consistent with a flexible \"coordinator\" mechanism, FPN connections were varied across tasks, while maintaining within-network connectivity to aid cross-region coordination. Consistent with a flexible \"switcher\" mechanism, CON regions switched to other networks in a task-dependent manner, driven primarily by reduced within-network connections to other CON regions. This pattern of results suggests FPN acts as a dynamic, global coordinator of goal-relevant information, while CON transiently disbands to lend processing resources to other goal-relevant networks. This cartography of network dynamics reveals a dissociation between two prominent cognitive control networks, suggesting complementary mechanisms underlying goal-directed cognition.\n\nSignificance StatementCognitive control supports a variety of behaviors requiring flexible cognition, such as rapidly switching between tasks. Furthermore, cognitive control is negatively impacted in a variety of mental illnesses. We used tools from network science to characterize the implementation of cognitive control by large-scale brain systems. This revealed that two systems - the frontoparietal (FPN) and cingulo-opercular (CON) networks - have distinct but complementary roles in controlling global network reconfigurations. The FPN exhibited properties of a flexible coordinator (orchestrating task changes), while CON acted as a flexible switcher (switching specific regions to other systems to lend processing resources). These findings reveal an underlying distinction in cognitive processes that may be applicable to clinical, educational, and machine learning work targeting cognitive flexibility.",

    "abstract": "A growing body of evidence has highlighted behavioral connections between musical rhythm and linguistic syntax, suggesting that these may be mediated by common neural resources. Here, we performed a quantitative meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies using activation likelihood estimate (ALE) to localize the shared neural structures engaged in a representative set of musical rhythm (rhythm, beat, and meter) and linguistic syntax (merge movement, and reanalysis). Rhythm engaged a bilateral sensorimotor network throughout the brain consisting of the inferior frontal gyri, supplementary motor area, superior temporal gyri/temporoparietal junction, insula, the intraparietal lobule, and putamen. By contrast, syntax mostly recruited the left sensorimotor network including the inferior frontal gyrus, posterior superior temporal gyrus, premotor cortex, and supplementary motor area. Intersections between rhythm and syntax maps yielded overlapping regions in the left inferior frontal gyrus, left supplementary motor area, and bilateral insula--neural substrates involved in temporal hierarchy processing and predictive coding. Together, this is the first neuroimaging meta-analysis providing detailed anatomical overlap of sensorimotor regions recruited for musical rhythm and linguistic syntax.",

    "abstract": "Small animal imaging has become essential in evaluating new cancer therapies as they are translated from the preclinical to clinical domain. However, preclinical imaging faces unique challenges that emphasize the gap between mouse and man. One example is the difference in breathing patterns and breath-holding ability, which can dramatically affect tumor burden assessment in lung tissue. As part of a co-clinical trial studying immunotherapy and radiotherapy in sarcomas, we are using micro-CT of the lungs to detect and measure metastases as a metric of disease progression. To effectively utilize metastatic disease detection as a metric of progression, we have addressed the impact of respiratory gating during micro-CT acquisition on improving lung tumor detection and volume quantitation. Accuracy and precision of lung tumor measurements with and without respiratory gating were studied by performing experiments with in vivo images, simulations, and a pocket phantom. When performing test-retest studies in vivo, the variance in volume calculations was 5.9% in gated images and 15.8% in non-gated images, compared to 2.9% in post-mortem images. Sensitivity of detection was examined in images with simulated tumors, demonstrating that reliable sensitivity (true positive rate (TPR) [&ge;] 90%) was achievable down to 1.0 mm3 lesions with respiratory gating, but was limited to [&ge;] 8.0 mm3 in non-gated images. Finally, a clinically-inspired \\\"pocket phantom\\\" was used during in vivo mouse scanning to aid in refining and assessing the gating protocols. Application of respiratory gating techniques reduced variance of repeated volume measurements and significantly improved the accuracy of tumor volume quantitation in vivo.",

    "abstract": "As bioprocess intensification has increased over the last 30 years, yields from mammalian cell processes have increased from 10s of milligrams to over 10s of grams per liter. Most of these gains in productivity have been due to increasing cell numbers in the bioreactors, and with those increases in cell numbers, strategies have been developed to minimize metabolite waste accumulation, such as lactate and ammonia. Unfortunately, cell growth cannot occur without some waste metabolite accumulation, as central metabolism is required to produce the biopharmaceutical. Inevitably, metabolic waste accumulation leads to decline and termination of the culture. While it is understood that the accumulation of these unwanted compounds imparts a less than optimal culture environment, little is known about the genotoxic properties and the influence of these compounds on global genome instability. In this study, we examined the effects on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells genome sequences and physiology due to exposure to elevated ammonia levels. We identified genome-wide de novo mutations, in addition to variants in functional regions of certain genes involved in the mismatch repair (MMR) pathway, such as DNA2, BRCA1 and RAD52, which led to loss-of-function and eventual genome instability. Additionally, we characterized the presence of microsatellites against the most recent Chinese Hamster genome assembly and discovered certain loci are not replicated faithfully in the presence of elevated ammonia, which represents microsatellite instability (MSI). Furthermore, we found 124 candidate loci that may be suitable biomarkers to gauge genome stability in CHO cultures.",

In this study we wanted to examine how these changes in patterns of activity affect the dimensionality of neural responses and information about choices. We addressed these questions by carrying out high channel count recordings in dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC; 768 electrodes) while monkeys performed a two-armed bandit reinforcement learning task. The high channel count recordings allowed us to study population coding while monkeys learned choices between actions or objects. We found that the dimensionality of neural population activity was higher across blocks in which animals learned the values of novel pairs of objects, than across blocks in which they learned the values of actions. The increase in dimensionality with learning in object blocks was related to less shared information across blocks, and therefore patterns of neural activity that were less similar, when compared to learning in action blocks. Furthermore, these differences emerged with learning, and were not a simple function of the choice of a visual image or action. Therefore, learning the values of novel objects increases the dimensionality of neural representations in dlPFC.",

    "abstract": "There is a growing number of dogs kept as companion animals, and the methods by which they are trained range broadly from those using mostly positive punishment and negative reinforcement (aversive-based methods) to those using primarily positive reinforcement (reward-based methods). Although the use of aversive-based methods has been strongly criticized for negatively affecting dog welfare, these claims do not find support in solid scientific evidence. Previous research on the subject lacks companion dog-focused research, investigation of the entire range of aversive-based techniques (beyond shock-collars), objective measures of welfare, and long-term welfare studies. The aim of the present study was to perform a comprehensive evaluation of the short- and long-term effects of aversive- and reward-based training methods on companion dog welfare. Ninety-two companion dogs were recruited from three reward-based (Group Reward, n=42) and four aversive-based (Group Aversive, n=50) dog training schools. For the short-term welfare assessment, dogs were video recorded for three training sessions and six saliva samples were collected, three at home (baseline levels) and three after the training sessions (post-training levels). Video recordings were then used to examine the frequency of stress-related behaviors (e.g., lip lick, yawn) and the overall behavioral state of the dog (e.g., tense, relaxed), and saliva samples were analyzed for cortisol concentration. For the long-term welfare assessment, dogs performed a cognitive bias task. Dogs from Group Aversive displayed more stress-related behaviors, spent more time in tense and low behavioral states and more time panting during the training sessions, showed higher elevations in cortisol levels after training and were more  pessimistic in the cognitive bias task than dogs from Group Reward. These findings indicate that the use of aversive-based methods compromises the welfare of companion dogs in both the short- and the long-term.",

However, whether GC-1spg cells are driven toward osteogenic differentiation under proper stimuli is uncertain. Additionally, the molecular mechanism of BMP9 remains unclear. In the present study, we aimed to determine whether BMP9 can induce osteogenic differentiation of GC-1spg cells. Recombinant adenoviruses were generated by the AdEasy system to regulate the BMP9 expression in GC-1spg cells. We identified osteogenic markers by real-time PCR and staining techniques in vitro. Ectopic ossification assays and histological analysis were also performed to verify the in vivo activity of BMP9. Finally, potential signaling pathways of BMP9 were assessed by transcriptome sequencing and KEGG enrichment analysis. Using recombinant adenoviruses, we demonstrate that BMP9 upregulates osteogenic markers including Runx2, osteocalcin, osteopontin, and Sox9. BMP9 also activates alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium deposition in GC-1spg cells. In vivo results show that BMP9 overexpression in GC-1spg cells promotes ectopic bone formation and chondrogenesis. In addition, RNA-sequencing and KEGG pathway analysis demonstrate that several signaling pathways are involved in BMP9-mediated osteogenesis. GC-1spg cells not only maintain spermatogenesis but also retain the ability to form bone tissue. Therefore, BMP9 activity in GC-1spg cells may help identify signaling pathways implicated in bone formation and could be of use in regenerative medicine.",

    "abstract": "Type 1, or autoimmune, diabetes is caused by the T-cell mediated destruction of the insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells. Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice spontaneously develop autoimmune diabetes akin to human type 1 diabetes. For this reason, the NOD mouse has been the preeminent murine model for human type 1 diabetes research for several decades. However, humanized mouse models are highly sought after because they offer both the experimental tractability of a mouse model and the clinical relevance of human-based research. Autoimmune T-cell responses against insulin, and its precursor proinsulin, play central roles in the autoimmune responses against pancreatic beta cells in both humans and NOD mice. As a first step towards developing a murine model of the human autoimmune response against pancreatic beta cells we set out to replace the murine insulin 1 gene (Ins1) with the human insulin gene (INS) using CRISPR/Cas9. Here we describe a NOD mouse strain that expresses human insulin in place of murine insulin 1, referred to as HuPI. HuPI mice express human insulin, and C-peptide, in their serum and pancreata and have normal glucose tolerance. Compared with wild type NOD mice, the incidence of diabetes is much lower in HuPI mice. Only 15-20% of HuPI mice developed diabetes after 300 days, compared to more than 60% of unmodified NOD mice. Immune-cell infiltration into the pancreatic islets of HuPI mice was not detectable at 100 days but was clearly evident by 300 days. This work highlights the feasibility of using CRISPR/Cas9 to create mouse models of human diseases that express proteins pivotal to the human disease. Furthermore, it reveals that even subtle changes in proinsulin protect NOD mice from diabetes.",

These multi-modal probes will serve as landmarks in matching up the large full cell volume datasets acquired by different imaging modalities. Fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) are a unique nanosized, fluorescent, and electron-dense material from the nanocarbon family. We hereby propose a novel and straightforward method for executing 3D CLEM using FNDs as multi-modal landmarks.

    "abstract": "Female reproductive function is negatively impacted by age. Animal and human studies show that fibrosis of the uterus contributes to gestational outcomes. Collagen deposition in the myometrial and endometrial layers is the main change related to uterine aging. Senolytic therapies are a potential option for reducing diseases and health complications related to aging. We investigated effects of aging and the senolytic drug combination of dasatinib plus quercetin (D+Q) on uterine fibrosis. A total of 40 mice, 20 young females (03-months) and 20 old females (18-months), were analyzed. Young (Y) and old (O) animals were divided into groups of 10 mice, with one treatment (T) group (YT and OT) and another control (C) group (YC and OC). Comparative analysis of Pi3k/Akt1/mTor and p53 gene expression among the 4 groups was performed to test effects of age and treatment on collagen deposition in uterine tissue. Uterine levels of microRNAs (miR34a, miR34b, miR34c, miR146a, miR449a, miR21a, miR126a, and miR181b) were evaluated. Aging promoted downregulation of genes of the Pi3k/Akt1/mTor signaling pathway (p=0.005, p=0.031, and p=0.028, respectively) as well as a reduction in expression of miR34c (p=0.029), miR126a (p=0.009), and miR181b (p=0.007). D+Q treatment increased p53 gene expression (p=0.041) and decreased levels of miR34a (p=0.016). Our results demonstrate a role for the Pi3k/Akt1/mTor signaling pathway in uterine aging and suggest for the first time a possible anti-fibrotic effect in the uterus of D+Q senolytic therapy.",

    "abstract": "The environment is sampled by multiple senses, which are woven together to produce a unified perceptual state. However, optimally unifying such signals requires assigning particular signals to the same or different underlying objects or events. Many prior studies (especially in animals) have assumed fusion of cross-modal information, whereas recent work in humans has begun to probe the appropriateness of this assumption. Here we present results from a novel behavioral task in which both monkeys and humans localized visual and auditory stimuli and reported their perceived sources through saccadic eye movements. When the locations of visual and auditory stimuli were widely separated, subjects made two saccades, while when the two stimuli were presented at the same location they made only a single saccade. Intermediate levels of separation produced mixed response patterns: a single saccade to an intermediate position on some trials or separate saccades to both locations on others. The distribution of responses was well described by a hierarchical causal inference model that accurately predicted both the explicit \\\"same vs. different\\\" source judgements as well as biases in localization of the source(s) under each of these conditions. The results from this task are broadly consistent with prior work in humans across a wide variety of analogous tasks, extending the study of multisensory causal inference to non-human primates and to a natural behavioral task with both a categorical assay of the number of perceived sources and a continuous report of the perceived position of the stimuli.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryWe experience the world through multiple sensory systems, which interact to shape perception. To do so, the brain must first determine which pieces of sensory input arise from the same source and which have nothing to do with one another. To probe how the brain accomplishes this causal inference, we developed a naturalistic paradigm that provides a behavioral report both of the number of perceived stimuli and their locations. We tested performance on this task in both humans and monkeys, and we found that both species perform causal inference in a similar manner. By providing this cross-species comparison at the behavioral level, our paradigm lays the groundwork for future experiments using neuronal recording techniques that may be impractical or impossible in human subjects.",
